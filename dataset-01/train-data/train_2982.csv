2,Panasonic poops,"The Panasonic wireless will drop out with placemant and people walking around the room. Examination of the FCC website (FCC ID ACJSEFX60A) shows that the unit does not use antenna diversity, which is essential for reliable paths at 2.4 GHz.The sound quality is only fair to poor because of the high degree of audio compression neccessary for the limited transmission bandwidth.Interference immunity is poor, the link drops out 10 feet from a microwave oven loaded with one cup of water, the unit does exhibit low idle noise, howeverVisual/aural latency is not specified. Latency is critical for lip synch, echo effects and stereo imaging. Audio streaming is easy - home theatre is notThis is a simple stereo transmission system, the speakers are tethered to a single receiver. It is not a true point to multipoint home theatre solution"
5,Efficient & Practical,"Love that it functions as it is supposed to and that because there is no wires it is easy to transport, move around, and hide so that it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb."
4,Very satisfied,"I have no complaints about the product. It does exactly what I want it to do, which is remove the need to run wires from the main unit to the rear speakers. The receiver is not too big to be intrusive, and the sound quality is fine. The unit is a refurbished one, but it is perfect, and the price was a lot more palatable than what Panasonic wanted when I bought the home theater system a couple of years ago. I would recommend it."
2,not so great...,"It was ok, I bought it for my boyfriend and he wasn't that impressed with its abilities. I think he used it twice..."
4,Mickey and Margalo team up for a new adventure!,"Bad, Badder, Baddest wasn't as good as their first Book Bad Girls, a five star book. At times you get bored but Mickey and Margalo make a good team you have to give the book credit for that!"
1,"Bad Design, Over priced.","I bought this to install over a 3"" partition wall which is supposed to be supported by this product. I tried to adjust the bracket on the back to fit over the partition and with the slightest adjustment it just broke off at the welds. Very poor quality and I would not recommend it."
2,Broke instantly,"Broke when using the very first time. The welds are extremely weak, the slightest tension around the bracket breaks themEven if it had precisely fitted my cube it looks pretty lame IMO. Bizarre how so many people gave it good reviews"
1,Broke before I could use it,"This coat hanger looked very promising in the picture but the hooks to go over the cubicle snap off as I was taking it out of the box. Very cheaply made, they were flimsy metal that seemed to be barely attached to the actual coat hook"
5,how are they not bigger???,"I don't know how this band has flown under the radar. They are so much better than blonde redhead, the obvious comparison. female front girl, standing about 4.5 ft tall, has one of the most amazing voices i have ever heard. haunting, beautiful, primal, passionate, backed by crescendo guitar work (some smashing pumpkins hidden in there), retro synthesizer sound, a bit of joy division, but truly unique. saw them live recently, and that is an experience. this is a no brainer."
4,A book on ballet center work that is easy to understand.,"Center work, in ballet, can always get a bit messy when practicing alone without a teacher to guide you. The instructions, along with the illustrations, are very understandable. The steps are simple, though, so an advanced student would use this book to strength weak points, rather than learn new steps. A great tool for anyone wanting to know a little about ballet."
1,Disappointing Olivia,I was very disappointed in this album. It is a collection of mostly non-descript songs from early in her career and was not what I expected. I should have paid more attention to the song content. I like Olivia but this is an album to forget.
5,great watch,"This is a timepiece that I love the most,very elegant.Please be advised that we have to pay attention on their deals,I made an honest mistake about using their credit card,noticing lately that they have 2 kinds of cards,Amazon.com Store Card and Amazon.com/Chase card.I thought I used the right card that gives 0 interest for six months,I was wrong and should have apply for their Amazon.com Store Card.I apologized."
2,surprised,"Wow! after waiting so long to get this book at a sane price for a paperback when it finally arrived I was surprised that it was in the form of a comic book complete with all illustrated pages.It took me about 30 minutes to read it and I seem to recall the plot in another book by this author,but in a much more detailed format.for those who prefer a comic type format and have little reading time this will work for you,however I prefer my novels long and detailed."
1,DISAPPOINTED,The shipper called me three times and gave me a window to wait for it.Then I waited but no Matt they did it 3 times.then called homedepot and they said sometimes amazon order take longer I said then why call me to wait so they called them and the shipper said they losted it.WOW still waiting
4,Looking for a quick review because you wanna buy? click here!,"the graphics look like n64 graphics, im not exaggerating. however, the controls are funny at first but you can always change them, this is a fun game but some puzzles require some brainwork. overall its fun, its got good music to it, not for everyone(not everyone's taste) but i like it."
3,BUMMER ! <> Must Rent..,This game could have been one of the best ever made for P.S. 2 so far.There is one major problem. The contol configuration is awful. If the makers of the game had only put an option to change the control set up it would be great. The cartoon style graphics kick butt.To bad the contorl set up STINKS.. Im Glad I rented it first. You will be too.
1,stupid game,"i bought this becuase it looked cool, sorry i was wrong this game [stinks]. the characters look cool but the controls are hard the graphics [stink] and the story play is horrible. i would not buy this game if i were you, if you want to at least rent it. i found watching barney seemed more entertaining. NEVER EVER BUY THIS STUPID GAME"
5,Joshua and the Guardian Protector Courage,"What a wonderful story! Ms. Holiday's writing style was quite refreshing and the story held my attention from beginning to end. I look forward to seeing what the writer has in store for Joshua and for us as readers. Thank you Amazon.Com for partnering with ""Joshua"" and Ms. Holiday!"
4,satisfactory,i thought this book taught me a lot of different things. but it didnt really help my anxiety. I tried all the techniques and they never calmed me down in my desperate moments. I mean it wasnt a bad book. I thought it was excellent. It just didnt help me.
3,This book is good for information on positive thinking.,"This book gives a story of one whom overcame panic disorder and tells how you can by using positive thinking. However, the book does not give a good holding for someone to treat themselves with. I need more information or ways on how I can master positive thinking. Therefore, I don't feel this book has any great value for someone who is in desperate need of help to recover from panic disorder."
4,"Some strong, positive focus phrases","Professionally I'm a very effective teacher, administrator and facilitator so I wasn't looking for setting goals of what I want to accomplish in that segment of my life. Lucinda encourages that. However I am just climbing up out about 3 years of life's extremes and in recent months panic attacks, which I've experienced during times of extreme stresses over the years, had returned full force. This book gave me some hand-holds to grab and has meant a great deal.Lucinda's quote by Shakespeare led me to be able to name what I really was seeking.....""My crown is content"". CONTENTMENT. That in itself is a goal. If what I'm doing doesn't lead to contentment then it needs to be reassessed and possibly eliminated.She also reinforced for me that *I* am my own place of safety and that ""everything is alright EXACTLY AS IT IS"". She led me to check my foundation and then to act on it. I am very grateful for finding this book right at this time."
3,eapoe,the book was ok thought it would be more helpful the book needed more details not simple surface information i would have rather read a book from a psychologist with more medical experience with how the mind works causing panic attacks and medicines which have a higher percentage rate for helping people the book may be good for people with minor panic attacks
2,DISAPOINTED,"VERY DISAPOINTED IN THIS BOOK, VERY LITTLE INSIGHT,, FROM LUCINDA, HARDLY ANY SELF HELP TECHNIQUES, ITS BASICALLY A STORY OF HER LIFE WE HAVE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN,,"
3,The Real World,I do not think that this book is for everyone. I am just a small town girl and it did not do much for me.
2,There are better books,"Like many things in life, you get much further if you like someone that's trying to teach you something. You tend to listen harder and trust more. That said, I don't like Lucinda Bassett, or to be more specific: she isn't right for me.I had trouble relating to most of the book and she lost me early on. I haven't traveled in years and most recently, I haven't left the house in many months due to panic and I'm reading about how she ""didn't enjoy her trip to Mexico."" I honestly didn't feel bad for her since I've not see the inside of a store in a while..let alone Mexico.I gave this 2 stars only because some people seem to enjoy her, and if you do then more power to you. For the others that find this work vacuous, I would recommend Dr. Claire Weekes or Bronwyn Fox strongly. It's straight to the problem and no fluff."
2,Meh,"I think there are more helpful books out there. I think Lucinda Basset gains her ""expertise"" from claiming to have had panic and anxiety problems in the past. While I don't discount the power of receiving help from someone who has been there, I question the seriousness of her anxiety and question her ""expertise"". I see it more of a money making kind of agenda. The book was repetative and obvious and while the tips are mildly helpful and true, not sure it would be what someone with full blown panic and anxiety disorders would need. Maybe helpful for someone with mild anxiety or difficulty adjusting to a life change."
5,love the CD.,I listen to this CD everyday I go to work. It helps to keep me balanced as I start my day. I recommend this CD to anyone who has anxiety.
2,A big waste of time and money if you are suffering,Do not waste your time or money. If you are suffering go and buy anything from Dr. claire Weekes.
3,Stress Mgmt review,"The book was informative and has good insight into anxiety. You have to be willing to do some work, because the book just gives a few examples to tell you how to think and change your life. I expected more since this woman has totally changed her life, but I will read again and put some changes into place."
1,"Just buy the ""Weekend Explorer Hong Kong: City of Life"" dvd","If you want to buy a dvd about Hong Kong in this series, don't waste your money on this dvd, just buy the ""City of Life"" dvd.The ""City of Life"" dvd contains it's own episode plus the ""Dragons"" episode on the 1 disc, even though it is not advertised.The ""City of Life"" dvd covers Hong Kong quite well, and is a great bargain at $14.95 for 2 episodes, and is misleading as it goes for over an hour, and only says 34 mins. The ""Dragons"" dvd just has the 1 episode and 30 mins of filler, showing other dvd's in the series.I believe this is a marketing ploy to make people purchase the ""Dragons"" dvd seperately, even though they don't need to. BEWARE!!!!"
2,Fairly limited,"There are NO videos or DVDs about the Music Business!! Particularly not up to date ones!! This is why I leapt on this DVD when I saw it. However, it could be so much better than it is. I wanted to show this to my music students, who all want to ultimately work in the Music Business This DVD is SO gospel/Christian orientated, that I think they would find it hard to screen it in order to get any information of value out of it.The DVD basically interviews various gospel DJs from gospel radio stations, which is fine, but that's all it is. The business principles are there, but so much of it is with reference to God, that I think my students would have a hard time watching it. No offense to God, but it is just not relevant to the subject in hand.Someone needs to make an up to date DVD on understanding the music business. This is not it."
3,Good starting point,"For novice duck callers like myself, this video offers good visual aid. The video is a little monotonus."
2,The Silent - Speaking Out,"Seemed like a great idea for a story. The language, however, was so salty for children in the 1860's that it didn't seem realistic. Certainly a 1990's version of a century old fictional story."
2,The Least Among Recent Civil War Novels,"Jack Dann's ""The Silent"" features a mix of overheated spiritualism, glaringly anarchronistic dialogue, and an embarrassingly voyeuristic approach to sex that left me chuckling inwardly at the same time I reproached myself for wasting my time on this bit of historical deconstructionism. Interestingly, one scene in a field hospital and another describing preparations for battle were so vivid and truthful that I was even more astounded by Dann's novelistic chicanery. Lump this in with ""Cold Mountain"" as one of the more wayward and self-indulgent misuses of American history in a novel."
2,Interesting idea that lost its way,"This book is interesting for the first hundred pages or so. In my opinion the narration then becomes bogged down, and the story moves at a snails pace. Mundy spends a inordinate amount of time in some scenarios, which are repititious and lost my interest as a reader. After a really good beginning this book really disappointed me greatly because I really wanted to enjoy this book.My copy had a series of questions in the back of it, as if the author thought his Civil War tome deserved to be some sort of literary classic studied in schools. I think it would be a good manuscript to be torn apart at a writers workshop. How to lose a reader's interest? How to develop paper thin characters and situations that are not fully resolved?"
3,Haunting and poignant but a bit too mystical,"Two years have passed since fourteen-year old Mundy McDowell observed the rape and subsequent murder of his parents. Since that brutal day on March 23, 1862, Mundy has silently wandered the Virginia battlefield, believing he is invisible. Mundy sees the first hand horror of war accompanied by a ""spirit dog, a ghost of a deceased slave, and ""baby Jesus"". The war forces the teen to grow up fast as rape, sex, and pedophilia occurs almost as much as death.The concept behind THE SILENT is absolutely brilliant. Seeing the Civil War from the mind of a battered teen is unique and refreshing. However, in spite of Jack Dann's obvious writing skills, he packs too many sub-plots into the novel. The mysticism is too mystical for this reviewer to ken and the too numerous rape scenes slow down the book. This novel remains a good story for Civil War buffs that do not mind seeing their heroes exposed (literally and figuratively).Harriet Klausner"
3,"Great story and characters, but exhausting to read","I went back and forth in my opinion of this book as I read, and had to force myself to keep reading several times. Which is strange since I really enjoyed the story. I thought the characters were great for the most part, but for a hint of the I'm a oh so soulful artist type becoming annoying at times. But it's always nice in this type of fiction to find some outdorsey ""manly"" type male characters. Very Hemingwaysesque. But what made reading this seem like a chore at times is the style. Very lyrical, really too much for the story. I understand the author is a poet and that doesn't surprise me having read this. The style would probably work well in a collection of short stories, but here it is just too much and he probably should have toned it down a little."
1,There's Better Canadian Fiction Out There,"I bought this book in the UK on the recommendation of a colleague who is a fan of Canadian literature. I really wanted to like this book, but I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed by it. It rambles on and on and I found its pretentiousness extremely irritating. My girlfriend thinks the female characters are insulting, and I have to agree with her. My co-worker praised Heighton's beautiful descriptions of scenery, and to be fair those parts are well written. This is not enough to carry the book however."
2,A Man Aftr God's own Heart,"We used this book in our men's study group. I was disappointed and if I had it to do over, I would not choose it. It has some good points but the author uses the word ""friend"" a lot to make certain points, and it really didn't seem ""friendly""."
4,Christian Man,"We are using this book in our men's Monday fellowship. We just started but it is a very easy read, short chapters that get straight to the point. Just the way men like it..."
4,Great Quality- Very Orange,"These look very cool at night. They also use AA batteries so you can juice the charge if its cloudy in the daytime. This is a great buy. Yes it's a bit plasticy so plant with care, but a great solution if you dont like the idea of kids running around the fuel of a real torch."
3,"Flicker Lights have good price, some weaknesses","Love the price. However, the 'flicker' is a steady, rythmical one. Not realistic flame-like. And while the 'spikes' may work in sand or softer dirt, they are not strong enough to pound into typical soil. They will need to be reinforced with a short pole or rebar if you want then to stay in and stay vertical (level)."
2,sounds like a duck call,I have seen this same opinion of a few other calls but hoped this one was different. Well its not. The sound it produces resembles a badly tuned duck call.I would not reccomend this call .
4,"A fun, fast-paced read","This book is terrific vacation or leisure reading. I enjoyed the page-turning action and suspense, as well as the vivid and accurate descriptions of Antarctica, especially the storms. ""Searchers"" is a unique blend of sci-fi, adventure/action, with just the right touch of romance. This author could well be the next Michael Crichton..."
3,Quality Issues,"First the good:1) Looks great -- probably the nicest, coolest looking 16"" bike I've seen ... provided you want the motorcycle look.2) Attention to detail on the motor, decals, and such3) Almost no assembly required.Now the bad:1) Front fender fell off after a while. Screwed it back on.2) All of the self-tapping screws that attach the seat to the rear plastic fell out after a couple of months. Had to go to the hardware store and reattach3) Other screws and nuts are constantly getting loose -- I feel like I'm having to rebuild this bike on a semi-regular basisThe price is high, but you're getting a real-looking Kawasaki branded bike. However, the quality is just not there to support the price."
2,Not the Best!,"I was so looking forward to reading this book and learning more about my beloved Inpector Morse. WRONG...the author writes about him but certainly not enough to label the book as any kind of a biography of the man. She had chapter, after chapter about herself and I felt she gave the reader the short end of the stick when it came to her husband, who by the way I felt she hardly knew as indicated in many ways throughout the book.In short, don't waste you time and money!"
5,I couldn't put this beautiful book down!,"I found John Thaw a very interesting actor and felt his Inspector Morse was more like him than a created character - maybe wishful thinking - he was so intellectual and the love of opera made him super special. His wife was super special too - a wonderful dual biography of the two of them as the title states - The ups and downs of their lives together are sad but her treatment makes them, at the same time, so very interesting in how they handled their tribulations and stayed in love and together. John had demons to conquer and he found the proper help to do so but I'm sure she was his rock. This was a powerful story of two lives intertwined - two very interesting people who just happened to be actors. I loved the book! Every John Thaw fan will too."
1,Do not try this at home.,I ordered this book and began to study the diagrams and directions. I soon found that the diagrams and the directions are not the same.The diagram will show a piece cut at 14 inches the directions say cut the same piece at 14 3/4 etc... these kinds of inconsistancies are numerous in every project and if you study the pictures it is clear that the person who built these lamps did not follow his own directions. This book was very poorly put together. I have bought many books with project plans and have never bought one with as many mistakes throughout the whole book.
4,A slight problem with measurements,"I agree that the designs are beautiful, but one must really review the cutting measurements and material supply measurements before attempting to construct any of these lamps. I am currently building the Wisteria (Fuji) Floor Lantern and have found numerous errors in specs. I am a novice woodworker, but even I can spot these errors."
3,Good for ideas,"I built the lantern depicted on the cover of the book first which looks beautiful. Other lanterns throughout the book are equally beautiful. The plan measurements, however, do not match the diagrams. Of course, I didn't catch this until after I made all my cuts and started putting it together. The lack of description only compounded my frustration. If you're interested in this book, I'd advise you to use it as a basic guide. You'll have to fill in the blanks yourself. All in all, the book provides exquisite examples of Japanese lamps so I'm glad I bought it."
5,Woodworking projects showcasing a Japanese motif,"Making Japanese-Style Lamps & Lanterns by graphic artist and expert woodworker Edward R. Turner is a superbly presented and thoroughly ""user friendly"" compendium of woodworking projects showcasing a Japanese motif for lanterns and lamps. From the Cherry Blossom (Sakura) Table Lantern, to the Wisteria (Fuji) Floor Lantern, to the Phoenix (Hoo) Lantern, to the Hokkaido Outdoor Garden Lantern, each project incorporates the use of contemporary lightning technology and easily available materials and tools in specific lists that are an integral part of each individual project. In addition to being enthusiastically recommended for do-it-yourself woodworking hobbyists, Making Japanese-Style Lamps & Lanterns would make a unique and welcome addition to Interior Design and Japanese Decorative Art reference collections as well."
3,Very powerful Magnet!,I bought this as a gift for my parents along with 5 of the CulenHome knives. They were very happy with how strong the magnet is and how nice it is to clear up counter space.
1,AlphaRewiwer,"Very disappointing in all respects. Usually a Lucinda Williams recommendation is right on, but not the case here. Angell rips off Faithful with no sense for a melody. Repeated listening solidfied my assessment."
3,No longer quite as shiny,"F-Zero was the original mode-7 racing game for the Super Nintendo. Scrolling background layers give the illusion of a 3D track, and you pilot one of four vehicles across multiple courses.The game's lost quite a bit of shine, mostly because Super Mario Kart took everything Nintendo learned from this experience and improved on it, including adding a two-player mode. Pop this cartridge in and it's easy to see how this game was revolutionary back in the day, but now the backgrounds are bland and flat and the races seem rather slow. The trademark F-zero music is still intact, however.A decent game for collection purposes, but the GBA versions feel superior, not to mention the 3D NIntendo 64 and Gamecube sequels."
4,The first one.,"This is the first F-zero game made and it is very fun. The graphics r pretty good but there are not very many colors. They use white and grey allot but the cars r just plain colors like red, blue, yellow, and orange. The sound is awsome and the music is catchy. I love racing games and this one is awsome. The bad thing about this game is the controls r hard and u fly off the track too eaisly. I like the newer ones better because of the graphics but i have to remember that this is the first one and its for the snes. Good racing game."
3,Kinda fun,"this game has terrible graphics.there's no point to it.you can't unlock anything.10 tracks 4 carsNO MULTIPLAYER >:Pi gave it 3 stars, both because i got it for [a good price]and becuz i love racing games, especially f-zero.it's fun to do grand prix and time trial. this game's prettyfun for awhile, but it mite get old to some of you,but i like it."
3,"Good, Nothing More...","Well, well... This was the first F-Zero game ever. Unfortunately, I didn't like this one very much, so I didn't play the other ones (F-Zero GX, F-Zero X...). Why didn't I like this game? Well, it's a pretty simple game.Graphics aren't good, the background is terrible. The race itself it's not funny, so it's not fun like in Super Mario Kart. The game, I believe, was a very fast racing game when it was released. But now, with the release of its sequel F-Zero GX for GCN, it doesn't look like you're riding a fast veichle, but looks like you're riding a turtle, because it gets really slow. There are some cars to choose, some racing circuits... The soundtrack is cool, but I prefer Super Mario Kart's too. Since it has no multiplayer mode, sooner or later you'll get sad of this game. Buy Super Mario Kart instead, if you want a good racing game for your SNES."
2,Ian's review,"f-zero is a bad game . do not buy it. it is bad because you can only be 4 racers,you can't unlock any more in the game. the game also only has 10 tracks and they are ALL pretty much the same. so don't buy it."
1,cheap,this game has only four cars.only fifteen courses.only a bobbly head in a car as a character.the game is cool at first but after a while you get really sick of it.
4,A relaxing Read,"I am very fond of the Alexander Mccall Smith books. The settings in Scotland really intrigue me and I never expect to get to see them so I enjoy the seemingly quiet, refined old-fashioned way of doing things, reminiscent of my youth. His knowledge of people and characterizations are superb. The story is not breathtaking but it is satisfying and that is important to me.Isabel, his main character, is a lovely, unselfish, refined woman and I think her philosophical discussions with herself are interesting."
3,"Unfortunately, our heroine has jumped the shark","I've enjoyed this series, as well as the 44 Scotland Street series, but this one didn't deliver. Having read it just a few weeks ago, I can only recall one story line - the new developments in Isabel's relationship with Jamie. (The other plots were apparently not even interesting enough to merit any MBs of long-term storage in my brain.) The story with Jamie seems oddly disembodied. (SPOILER AHEAD) The friends become lovers, but Jamie is so offhand, so non-committal in the scenes we see, he's barely a character. Is he happy about the relationship? Just going along? It seems as if Isabel's fantasy remains a fantasy, even when it comes to fruition. I'm not the least bit bothered by the May/December aspect of the relationship, but Jamie is so weirdly silenced in this book that it feels a little like child abuse. Didn't work."
4,Makes a Girl Think...,"A very good read for anyone searching fiction that gives perspective on our inner selves.Isabel certainly is not boring. There was a bit too much romance in The Right Attitude to Rain (2006) for my tastes. I would have liked to see more mystery interspered with the philosopy.The niece, Cat, also seemed dull. Cat could easily leave the country and be written out as far as I am concerned. This book was less an adventure for Isabel and more about getting her man, which even after she does, it is very apparent that Isabel is just waiting for the other shoe to drop.Alexander McCall Smith is a treasure and and writes like a dream, but it may be a failing of male authors to put so much stock in making their characters into couples. Who knows. I only ask the question."
2,The Right Attitude to Rain,"i loved all of the previous books by Alexander McCall Smith and looked forward to each new one, although the frequency of publications does make one question if his writing has turned into a pure money producing scheme. However this novel failed to develop Isabel in the manner that I have always viewed her character and has became superficial. To end as this does seems extrordinarily superficial to meet a mass market view of society, and reminds me of the second movie in the 'Back to the Future.' This novel destroyed Isabel for me.mark"
5,Another satisfying story from McCall Smith,"What I love about his Sunday Philosophy Club books is that they really make you think whilst at the same time you also enjoy where the story takes you. I find that the author has tremendous insight into people's motives and inner lives but he is never heavy-handed. I like the romantic element in this installment, as well, but these could never be called romance novels! I highly recommend this series."
3,Uh Oh... What is Going On With This One?,"If, on the one hand, Mr. Smith is showing us that Isabel, despite thinking all the time (ad nauseam) over every painstaking deatil of what are usually nonessential ideas, has very little REAL sense of morality, then okay, I should really give this one four stars, instead of three, for a clever twist on the part of the author.But I am not sure that Mr. Smith has not merely dropped the ball. The ending of this one is a huge disappointment: the ""mystery"" is not much of one, and Isabel's own ""predicament"" borders on the ridiculous. It makes of what I thought was a character written as intelligent and sensitive instead a clod, driven by the same things that drive those of us who cannot afford to philosophize on everything that comes into our daily lives.I miss Precious!"
5,Isabel Dalhousie takes a new direction,"This is a wonderful, meandering story that gives the Isabel Dalhousie series a totally new focus. Isabel comes to the fore as a central character instead of her accustomed role as an observer of others. To be sure, the reader still gets the benefit of her ongoing philosophical mulling of virtually everyone and everything that happens in her life, but in this book, she actually HAS a life. And it's a life that has real emotion and serious romance. Throughout this book (and the rest in the series), the author, Alexander Mccall Smith, uses his characters so well to demonstrate the unceasing zig-zagging that marks everyone's interior lives and ultimately serves up a continuing story full of human foibles, generosity, uncertainty, warmth and love of all kinds. Like virtually all of Mccall Smith's books, ""The Right Attitude to Rain"" leaves the reader feeling better about human kind and reflective on how to better deal with life's fellow travelers."
3,Good -- but not a mystery!,"I have really enjoyed Alexander McCall Smith's books, especially the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, but also the first book in the Isabel Dalhousie series, ""The Sunday Philosophy Club."" Isadel is delightful and I love ""visiting"" Edinburgh. However, this book is not a mystery! I kept waiting for a crime and none was committed, except very late in the book -- in Texas! I just thought another reader might like to know. I might have read the book anyway, but I wouldn't have continued wondering who was going to die!"
3,What Mystery?,"I enjoyed the first book of this series, but I found this one to be a bit tedious. She spent most of it sounding like a 13 year old girl obsessing over her first crush. ""Should I go after a younger man? Does he like me? How should I act around him?""And the only mystery was...where was the mystery?? Okay, there were some questions about the motives of others (which were never fully answered) and there was the mystery of, ""Does Jamie like me, too?"" But those don't really qualify it as a mystery novel.Read it if you like Isabel, don't read it if you're expecting a mystery."
4,She would have debated....,"I liked Isabel Dalhousie in the first two novels and got to know her. That's why I KNOW she would have given the eventuality here analysis from all angles first. The best we can do is assume she did and McCall Smith didn't bother to share it with us. I don't know how he would have done that and kept the impact of the ending, but he should have -- that's what he gets paid the big bucks for. Isabel ponders everything from little white lies to murder. It's totally out of character for her not to have thought this one through. That said, I like her and will continue to read the series. If there's a fourth novel, perhaps Smith can also breathe some life into Jamie."
4,The Right Attitude to Rain: An Isabel Dalhousie NOvel,Very good continuation of the series. Leaves you wanting to read the next book in this series.
3,Out of His Element,"I have really enjoyed the No. 1 Ladies Detective series and this series up to this point. This was a let down on several levels. This is the first time it has been very apparent that the woman protagnist is being written by a man. Isabel's emotional state in this book is unbelievable based on the prior books in this series. It does not ring true with the heart of a woman. Staying in the realm of ethics and philosophy is fine, but in the matters of the heart Mr. McCall is a fish out of water from the women's perspective. There was no real ""mystery"" in this novel, other than the reaction of or lack thereof from Jamie with the turn of events. The ending disappointed me and is not making me anxious to read the next installment, overall very unsatisfying. I just hope the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency continues to satisfy."
2,Like bad script editing,"This is the first Alexander McCall Smith book I've read. For all the praise of his various series I'm amazed at how awkward the writing is. People do things with very ambiquous motives or poorly described feelings and you think he's being purposely vague because he's going to reveal more later, or there will be some suprise to it. Nope. Just not very well done. Things happen that you think are set ups for important events but then go nowhere. Two people who have either attraction or tension between them end up in the same place alone together and you're sure something significant is going to happen, or at least that it will be revealed later. Nope. The scene just ends and you're left hanging. It feels like a movie that was much longer and great hunks have been cut out of the middle leaving jerky editing and setups that are never resolved. Don't know how he achieved such success."
2,not as good as expected,"The book has nice photographs and examples of stamping, but doesn't have enough information about the techniques nor the supplies used. I didn't like it. I thought I would learned everything for stamping but this is not the right book. I think I would keep searching in other books."
3,"Case scenarios for Cardiology, Endo, GI, and Hematology","This book covers Cardiology, Endocrinology, GI and Hematology of the Underground Clinical Vignettes series. This series will help you, if you have trouble getting a clinical picture of each disease, or cannot associate important facts with clinical scenarios (keywords etc). It seems to me that this series are intended to supplement the ""First Aid for Step 2"", but it is also useful as a simulator when you cover the last row of the page (where diagnosis is written) and guess the dianosis by reading through the history and findings in the scenario. On the other hand, if you can associate the facts to clinical picture, this book is not a ""must-have""."
4,Interesting read,"Read this for World Religions course, and it was pretty good. Interesting history of different religions and their connections to Christianity. Author does not insult any beliefs, which was nice."
2,A New History with Nothing New,"I guess The River of God is technically a new history of Christian origins since it is a new book. However, new does not equate with original. Riley disappoints by not coming up with any original ideas from what I could see. He just rehashes the same old story of Christianity forming from many cultural influences. If you have read anything from somebody at the Claremont School of Theology, the various Ivy League theology schools, or the Jesus Seminar, then you have already read what this book has to offer. I expect more from a professor than to simply publish a long book report of other people's ideas.This is also not a book for Christians who believe in the bible and the God of the bible. Riley's Jesus is more of a relativist created by cultural influences before him as opposed to being God in the flesh."
3,Use with caution,"This is a handy book to have on any rehabbers bookshelf. HOWEVER, it better not be the only one. Much of the information it contains is old - much advancement has been made over 25 years of rehabbing animals and even though this book has been ""revised and updated"" the diets and feeding information seem to have remained the same. For example - baby birds should not be encouraged to drink milk or water. You are more likely to drown them than help them. Baby birds get their water from the food their parents (or rehabber) properly provides. Still, as a resource for splinting and caring for injuries, there is some valuable information. Just be sure to supplement it with some newer publications as well."
3,"""Revised"" but not by much","I compared the 1998 ""revised"" edition with the original 1973 edition and found that the number of pages were exactly the same. The differences between the latest and the first editions are virtually undetectable so if you are thinking of replacing your first edition with the latest, don't bother."
5,The story of Tir-Nan-Og continues...,Mr. Deitz again takes us to the enchanting world of fairie with this story. As Calvin's tale unfolds you are caught up in Mr Diets' ability to weave a tale so suspensful it keeps you rapt until the end. Well worth the effort to locate!
4,Southern Gothic,"I can single-handedly thank WSP for introducing me to the music of Vic Chesnutt. Having first bought ""Nine High A Pallet"" a few years ago I was a tad skeptic. After a few listens it all made sense and I went on to purchase further albums in the Vic catalog.This new offering is no exception. Unlike it's predecessor, ""Cobalt"" has the whole band backing Chesnutt which pushes the envelope even further."
2,Widespread Panic Fan,"The musicianship by WP is great as usual; the vocals by Vic Chesnutt leave alot to be desired. I thought that I was getting a WP quality CD, however, I was mistaken."
2,Not for the Casual Gamer.,"I have both the Prophesies and Nightfall campaigns and those are both great, especially Nightfall, but by the time you get about half way through the Eye of the North it gets extremely hard and the missions/quests are insanely long. It takes about 2 to 3 hours to get through a dungeon. If and when you get to the boss at the end, you have to use some special method of defeating them, which you can't figure out unless you get to this boss at least once and be sure to do research online to find out what others have tried. Therefore the first time, you can be sure to get killed without finishing the quest (if not several times). This is extremely frustrating after putting in several hours. I also think the scenery in the dungeons is mostly repetitive rock, lava, ruins, etc.To me this was made for the hardcore gamer that wants to be extremely challenged. I don't have the time and I don't like to leave Guildwars running on my computer all day."
3,This Game Requires that you have other PC Games First,If you are thinking of purchasing this product first consider have you bough the original product this is an expansion pack game in which you must already have the original game in order to play.
1,Big Problems!!,"Problem 1 Ranger pets not being able to go around a single spirit. This leaves a whole attribute line ineffective. Often times the pet will get stuck behind you. One tactic of Ritualists is to create a spirit on the corner of the map as to not allow a pet to get by, lol.Problem 2 Ritualists are able to create 6 to 8 spirits before a single battle has started. In Team Arena or Random Arena this is basically like having a 5vs4 match. Rits can disrupt, knockdown , blind, do damage and other things.Problem 3 In Random Arena you can face a team that has 3 monks in which no one dies and this can lead to a draw. In that case both teams lose stopping a teams streak.Problem 4 In 4vs4 matches the action is fast and you need to target quickly. Can you imagine toggling through 8 spirits before even targeting a player. It gets worse when you face 2 Ritualists lol. What a joke.Cheers!"
5,Contined Saga,The game continues the original and is the last step before Guild Wars 2. The action is just as good and the bad guys cover the full spectrum from bad to super bad. Tons of fun in a safe playing atmosphere. And NO MONTHLY FEES!!!!
3,Possibly good but not tested enough,"Eye of the North might have been a good expansion to Guild Wars, but it wasn't tested nearly enough. Once the expansion went live, many people started to have their CD keys for their Guild Wars expansions disappear off their account. This made it very difficult, if not impossible, for most of the players with this problem to play the game at all. That wouldn't have been a problem if the problem was resolved immediately by customer support, but it seems customer support has been swamped and response times have been horrible.I am not saying that the expansion is bad or shouldn't be purchased, but I would reconsider purchasing it until they have time to get some of these major bugs worked out."
5,Good expansion,"The first expansion for guild wars that's not a standalone as well. It did very well, the difficulty really raises the bar, but can get tedious and somewhat frustrating. Overall, great game...especially for an MMO with no monthly fee!"
1,No good on older engines.,"I installed this on a stock 2 barrel carburated 1968 Ford 302. I discovered this is a ""narrow band"" unit rather than a ""wide band"", as many other air-fuel ratio monitors are. Apparently the narrow band units will only read a very small range of air-fuel ratios which must be near 14.7:1. Because my engine is an older carburated type, the carburator does not provide a constant and stable fuel mixture at all power and loads and it does vary from a constant 14.7:1. The K&N indicator flashes and goes blank regularly depending on throttle and load and provides little information which can be used or interpreted. This unit is almost useless for me. It might work on a newer fuel-injected engines but is of no value in an older engine."
4,What if he was just a nobody?,His story is well told. I found myself thinking about all the small things that many of us really don't ponder about Iraqi life sitting in our modern homes living our modern lives. That is the true gift that this book gives the reader is its insight in to the struggles of ordinary iraqis that leads them in to taking up arms and doing some of these things that we all here about. My only issue with his story is that he never explains how some one with less connections would fair in his same predicament. I don't think that the story would end quite the same way.
2,This was written by journalists?,"It was strange to me, after finding so many glorious typos, that this book was written by journalists. It made me question its validity. Since his captors were hardly violent in the story, maybe they in fact were the ones who wrote this book? Is the cover of the book jacket in essence a film still of the captors video they used to get Americans all hyped up? Was this book written to cover up some other truth we are still not allowed to know about these types of make believe money wars?"
5,very fun game Happy customer,The game was shipped on time and the condition as described. I would gladly use this seller again in the future.
3,This classic is a little dated,"Super Mario Kart is a good game, the first to use iconic characters. The issue is that the controls and dated 3D make the game kind of hard to operate. It was hard to turn corners with a D-pad, so I used a joystick (on the Wii's classic controller). It was just as hard. The camera stayed right behind the kart and never shifted, making it even harder. The good news is that if you have Mario Kart DS, Wii, or 7 they have updated some of the SNES tracks."
4,one of the most addictive wrestling games ive ever played,"you are just the mario characters in a wild world of the most awesome go-kart tracks in the universe!you can get all sorts of power ups that can be used as weopons or traps on the other players.it NEVER gets old,so play on and on and on and ....."
3,"Bad Graphics, good races","This game is not using Super NES colors to the fullest. The character graphics could be the same on NES. The backgrounds are almost as updated as GBA. The races are very good, although short (due to 5 laps). I would recommend this game for people born in 1984 and earlier (seven years before I was). This game is 10 years old, but the races are great for its time."
4,good game but not great,This game is a fun game to play if you have some friends over but thats about it. They have only about 10 or so levels and eight characters. Over all a great game for its time but not a clasic
1,Super Mario Kart not as good as Mario Kart 64,"I had a Nintendo 64, but missed the games on Super Nintendo; super mario world, sim city, pilot wings... I had Mario Kart for the N64 and really liked it, so when I bought a SNES I thought I'd get Mario Kart for that, however it's not nearly as good as it is on the N64. I was very much disappointed. However, in general, the games on SNES are much better then N64."
1,Super Mario Kart for Super Nintendo,The graffics are horrible!! When I play the game I feel like I could throw up. Terrible game. I will never play it again.
5,Early 90s Karts at their finest,"Once you get past the semi-weird steering, you'll begin to realize that the first of a terrific series of kart-racing games has a lot to offer. You get to race in around 20 tracks as your favorite of the eight playable characters, and use items against CPUs or your friend.I'm pretty sure everybody's favorite item would be the Star. I mean seriously, who doesn't like it?The 2-Player Battle Mode is where you and your friend pit against each other and throw random kinds of stuff at each other until one of you lose.Overall, do you wanna see what was first kart-racer has to offer? Go ahead and buy it."
4,Great customer service,My kids love the game and the seller was great. Very responsive and item was just as described.
1,Not working Item,not working item !!! but i didnt replace it because it costed me like 5 dollars and its not worth the headace of doing that !!
3,Alright,I think I must have been more used to the game for the Nintendo 64. That one was more exciting. I wish this one was more like that one.
2,"Dirty connectors, does not work",Game came very quick which was nice. The problem was when I tried to play it. The game didn't work. I had to clean the connector pins to get it to even show up. I will try to clean them some more and get the game to work properly.

3,In Search Of America DVD,"This was a great Made-For-TV film that attempted to bring together the two halves of the great ""generation gap"" of the time. Yeah, it's a little cheesy in parts, but its still a great trip into the past. This was when ""hippies"" had become ""freaks"", and the media was out to capitalize on everything they could. This isnt really a '60s film' per se, as much as it is a 'hangover-from-the-60s' film. I remember seeing the ad on TV for this when I was a kid. The only problem I had with this product was the fuzzy, washed-out condition of the picture. It's obviously a video-dub; a bootleg. But I was willing to make allowances for this long-lost gem from another era! NOTE-If you like this movie, track down ""Maybe I'll Be Home In The Spring"" with Sally Fields for more early 70s Made-For-TV counterculture!"
1,It Doesn't Even Deserve the Whole One Star,"Wow, Wow! What to say about this movie. Actually, can you even call this a movie? I doubt it. My loving father who wished to spend family time with us bought this movie at the Dollar Tree for 50 cents. It couldn't even be a full dollar it was so bad. The editing was subpar and often had random long blank screens. This movie was so bad at times you wished death upon the characters, so the movie would JUST END! Kutos to Jeff Bridges who attempted to bring life to such a poorly written movie. The modern equalvilant would probably be The Secret Life of the American Teenager, which also prides itself on having poor acting and a unrealistic and just plain awful script. If you are planning on buying this movie I have one piece of advice for you, DON'T. If someone offered me this movie free of charge, I would rip it out of their hand, smash it to a bloody pulp, and then set it on fire. But overall, it offered many laughs, but not in the way it was intended to."
1,Don't waste your time,"This movie was basically about a family camping out with some woodstock wannabes. If that's what interests you in a movie, Hey, buy several. As for me, I wish I hadn't wasted my money or my time. No plot, no objective, no reason to watch this movie. Don't buy it or even rent it, if you are invited to watch it by family and friends, just say no!"
5,The best Tarot book I ever read,I'm a Tarot schoolar and teacher. This book is a must to all beginners and not so beginners Tarot lovers. Indeed is the best Tarot book I haver read and I recommend it to every person really interrested in Tarot as a serious and honorable matter.
4,What a great find,I actually got this book from the Library... figured I check it out...OMG.. love it. I am a novice at tarot and since ive been doing the lessons in this book it has made me appreaciate the art of tarot even more so.. I am such a dork i actually have plotted my whole family yearly cards onto graph paper.. Found out some interesting patterns.. for example my kids are born 8 years apart but at the time of both of their births my year tarot card was the same. Very cool.If you are new to the Tarot I would seriously tell you to get this book.. I will be purchasing my very own copy asap to keep with other books that I use as refrence..
5,Therapy and Tarot,"An excellent way to learn the secrets of Tarot while discovering some secrets about yourself. You will appreciate Tarot as a tool for self-therapy not just for ""fortune telling"". You learn to use the images of the cards to help assimulate your own thoughts, fears, and dreams into words. Gave me a whole new outlook and understanding for Tarot."
3,"Great Beginning Book, With a Few Mistakes","""Tarot for Your Self"" is great book that gives you a basic understanding of the tarot. It provides permutations, and the basic spreads. Yet, it fails to give you suggestions for doing your own spreads. The beginning of each section is great because it gives you an understanding of the coming chapter, but it could give you greater depth and more background information. Furthermore, I feel the first chapter lacks any significance because it clearly is only talking about astrological information with no relation to the tarot cards. Astrological information does have significance, but the connection is not shown here. I would recommend this book for a beginer wishing to understand the tarot. For intermediate or advanced, it is too simple for the more advanced."
4,Good,It's interesting n real good book u do have to do alot of work with it so if ur the type that just wants to read I wouldn't suggest it but like I said it's good and it's worth the work that you put into it.
5,Tarot,"This book is great, lots of interesting things to read. It was recommended by our tarot class."
3,Decent.....,"When I purchased this book, I understood that it was a workbook, but I underestimated just how much work I would have to do. I found the break down of year cards and stregnth cards interesting, but I am still trying to figure out how it all fits together. I was totally confused when I came to the part about numerology. My guess is that this book is not meant for those just learning tarot."
1,An honest review of -Tarot for Your Self : A Workbook for Personal Transformation Second Edition,"This book is more geared towards the beginner, though even beginners need to have basic meanings to base their ideas on which this book fails to deliver. In its chapters it refers to reading material to research ie other books on the subject that pertain to the chapters teachings.The whole point of buying this book is so you dont have to buy any others otherwise you would have bought them instead!This book promises so much and delivers very little!A very disapointing book, better introductory and advanced books are available!"
5,"Wonderful tarot book, it is already a classic.","This book has become a classic on its own right. The reasons behind this are the wonderful exercises you can find in it (the one called ""Look at a card"" is now so popular that you hardly can't find a new tarot book that somehow doesn't quote it), the inspirational way to describe card relationships and so many other things! The book draws heavily on a Jungian approach, meaning that the author focuses on how a card resonates with every different reader. Whereas this book will teach a lot on divination, if you follow its programme it will teach even much more about your self. I know there are other wonderful books on tarot, but this is the one I would go for if I could buy just one."
3,"Okay, not great","This workbook arrived with a lot of writing in it, which I erased or covered, but it was a little annoying and I expected it to be in better condition than was described in the listing. If you are seriously into the tarot, this might be good, but as someone who just uses it from time to time, I didn't find it all that useful, and it has just been sitting on my shelf a long time now. I may recycle it, just as its previous owner did."
4,A workbook for Personal Transformation 2nd Edition,Have enjoyed the book and step by step introductions
4,i'm happy,"these are great for everyday use, they fit well in my ears (better than the ones that are standar for i-pods) and are very very comfortable. the only reason for me not rating these a 5 is the lack of bass compared to my other ones. the rest of the sound is very crisp and i recommend these for their price value. worth the time and money, im using them now. :)"
3,"good sound, tough on ears","the headphone sounds great. it's just too big for my ears. make it very uncomfitable, the longest time i can wear this is half hour."
4,nice set of inexpensive replacement headphones for ipod,"i got these headphones a few days ago and have used them with my ipod when i work out. they're great for the gym because they're super lightweight and the buds are very soft. after running and lifting, my ears have hurt with other replacements-- but not with these ones! and the sound is fairly good, a lot like the original ipod headphones. great replacements, especially if you don't want to pay $40 for the apple headphones.oh and like others have mentioned, one of the cords is slightly pink-red in color-- but its not noticable from a few feet away.overall they're a good pair of inespensive headphones."
3,"not bad for the price, but it's not for the avid music listener","I bought this earphone to replace my ipod earphones, and it's almost the same quality if not slightly better. The sound is clear but the bass is lacking. As for comfort, at first it was painful to wear for longer than 30 mins, but if you switch the earphone from left to right and vice versa (R in left ear and L in right ear) then it's very comfortable. I wear it at work for more than 4 hrs at a time and i sometimes forget that i have them on. The color of this earphone is not white, which many of the past reviewers pointed out. Color was not of great concern to me when i purchased this item , cause it was cheap and it had good reviews."
3,mixed feelings,feels comfortable in your ear and sound quality is good but...it tends to get tangled up easily
2,I don't understand the good reviews...,"I just picked up a pair of these, and i could not disagree more with the other reviews.The size and shape made them horribly uncomfortable to put into my ear, and the sound quality was like listening to my music through a tin can on a string.It seems fairly obvious that most of these reviewers are casual music listeners, or partially deaf, because these phones get no bass whatsoever. If you are looking for a pair of throwaway headphones, get a cheaper pair; if you are going to bother spending $10 on headphones, look elsewhere."
3,gummy headphones,"these came quickly and were a great price, however if doing a lot of running/exercising - you may want to find something that is a better quality. The earpiece is pretty large and doesnt stay in your ears that well."
2,This product is ok!,"Well, the reason why I bought this particular pair was, because of the price and the color (white) to go with my iPod...and you get what you pay for. Sound quality is good, but whatever JVC makes the cord out of is crazy. I put it in my bag for five minutes, pull it back out and notice it's all tangled up. It takes 10 minutes to untangle them. If the Apple 's earbuds were cheaper I'd buy them. I don't feel like paying $30 for headphones. The part that goes inside your ear is way too thick for my small ears and it keeps falling out."
3,Cords made of gumy material tangle easily,"They seem to work fine as earbuds, at least for the audiobooks and podcasts that I listen toobut...They easily become a tangled mess. The wires are made of the gumy material which does not slide over itself so they easily get tangled when you take them off and wrap them up."
5,good set from jvc,"these are great and easy..nice sound not too much bass but then again I own an ipod. I bought these for this kind of use..I have seen the other reviews that have complained about not staying in your ears...well there`s a fix to that...all you need to get is earbud covers.. get them from ""radioshack""they are the best you get 2 sets of those for 3.99 so that takes care of that problem ...the second thing is that people have said the bass..ok here goes..just go into your setting`s on your ipod and adjust the ""EQ"" see what sound is best for your music..thats all it takes. you should be better for it..hope that helps you . it did for me..they are a great little set of earbuds.."
4,For such a low price...,Thgese work surprisingly good. I can never keep these types of pods in my ears but these work very good. The only negative is that the sound could be a little better...but hey...I can live with that.
3,ok for the price,"These are relatively cheap, so I can't complain that much. However, they do become very uncomfortable after approximately 1/2 hr of wear (ears hurt). Not very gummy, only slightly rubbery. Sound quality is ok."
3,They don't stay in...,"The sound quality is great, but whenever I try to work out with these, they are so big that they won't stay in my ears. Seriously, just screw fashion and go with the headphones that sit over your ears (the kind that they used to sell with walkmans), they would be much more comfy and manageable."
3,"Good value, so far","I purchased this because my original iPod earbuds broke. I wanted something inexpensive and sounds ok, and these earbuds fit the bill so far. I like the long cord because I'm tall and ususally keep the iPod in my pocket while working out/hiking/walking. The earbuds use a earplug-type wire like you find with AM radios. Haven't put much stress on them yet. Bass sounds ok. Doesn't handle a lot of volume, but loud enough.Down the road, or maybe for the Holidays, I will get an upgrade."
2,"Inexpensive, but they hurt and the packaging is impossible to open without scissors","I stopped by the school bookstore in hopes of finding Apple Earbuds. Unfortunately, they didn't have any, but I needed headphones and decided to spend $10 on a spare pair. They're a decent alternative, but I'll still be picking up a pair of Apple's."
2,Doesn't last very long.,I bought these because I really needed a new pair of ear buds. They worked great the first few days and there were no problems. But a week later when I dicided to listen to my ipod again the sound in left ear bud was fading out. The right was fine but you could hardly hear out of the left. I don't blast the volume on my ipod but I've had other earbuds last way longer than this pair. What a waste of $10.
3,Made for Dumbo?,"The product was pretty disappointing. Don't be fooled by the product's name ""Gumy"". They are not soft or comfortable. They do have a very thin rubber layer on them so maybe that's where they get the name. The worst part about them is they are HUGE. I have normal size ears and had a friend with large ears try them and they are just too big. They do not sit will in the outer ear and fall out very easily. The only reason this product gets three stars is the decent sound quality. But save your money and for an inner ear headphone. You won't be disappointed."
5,Great starter book!!!,Great way to introduce books to your children. The black and white graphics really captured my daughter's attention. She still loves to flip through this book.
4,Almost as good as Black On White,"I bought this book and ""Black on White"" (also by Tana Hoban) for my son when he was one month old. He liked them both, though ""Black on White"" was clearly his favorite (he reached for that one more often when they were both in front of him and there are far more tooth marks on that book).Still, the white silhouettes of familiar objects on a black background did catch his interest when I turned the pages for him, and the simple, two-color book did interest him early on.As with ""Black on White,"" however, I find that his interest in ""White on Black"" waned when he turned about seven months old in favor of other, more colorful books.If you only want to buy one book of this type, I would suggest going with ""Black on White."" However, I believe the two books do provide a good variety for a very young infant."
3,Black on White is better,"This book is okay, but my infant nephew preferred Black on White (see the reviews) and one of the 2 is really enough."
5,My son's favorite toy.,"I bought this book by mistake. But my five month old son does not think so. He likes it better than any other toys he has, always getting excited at the sight of the book."
5,Cute Book for young Children!,Cute book to read or have children read. Still have the book at one it's not a favorite but it's read.
5,Excellent reading and insight into pyramid power.,This book is a great resource for those wanting to learn about the power of pyramids. Bill Schull and Ed Pettit did a great amount of research into the subject and it is a very informative book.
5,This works!!!,"I've used these cardboard pyramids for 30 years now, and I can verify from experience that they work. Wine becomes better when set under it one day, my plants grow like mad using pyramid water, I drink only pyramid 'cooked' drinks, they taste better and make me healthy. I sleep under a larger pyramid to ease my back pain and sleep better. I astral travel better when I set a crystal pyramid on my forehead. The list goes on and on!!! JUST TRY it!!!Tianca"
3,Not the greatest.,I wasn't impressed w/this book. I expected more but felt that all I purchased was a history lesson. The instructions for building a pyramid wasn't impressable either. I have another pyramid book that gives better instructions & less of a history lesson. I like both authors but this isn't the better book they'd written.
5,Pyramid power,"I find this product very interesting and insightful. It gives plenty of examples of the power of pyramids, and how to build them if you want to."
4,Classic Shoot 'Em Up Combo,"This game pairs two classic aracade favorites. Both provide fast-paced, addictive gaming fun."
4,Me like,These worked as expected. I needed the medium size hooks and haven't had a chance to use the small ones yet.
4,Great Organzation,These worked great to organize all the wires behind our entertainment center that run to the stereo and TV. Just make sure to let the hooks seat themselves onto the surface of where ever you install them before you put the wires in place. We waited several hours.
2,Not good,The small ones break with the tiniest amount of pressure. You *have* to put some pressure on them to get the cord in the clip. Super expensive for how cheaply made these are.I ended up using the BlueLounge CableDrop holders instead.
2,Ok I guess,glue strips tear when trying to remove them (as per instructions) which leads to the paint being ripped from my walls....
3,Sufficient!,Works for one wire of average width! Not durable for heavy cable wires! Other than that it is quite functional and helps to to identify easily wires with equipment!
5,These things are amazing!,"I love these cord organizers! Every night I plug my smart phone in beside my bed and get so tired of having to hang upsidedown to find the cord. Half the time I end up getting the laptop cord or tablet cord by mistake! Since I put one of these on the side of my nightstand, I have instant quick access to my phone charging cord! Since its hidden between my bed and the night table, you can't even see it. Worth every penny! Sticks well. I can't wait to see where else I can use these."
1,Didn't work for me.,"I applied several of these according to the instructions, including the alcohol prep of the site. All but one of them failed to adhere after 24 hours."
4,Nice starter kit,"If you have some stray cables that you want to neaten up, this kit is a good starting point. I have a hard time finding these cord organizers at stores in my area, but the pack has a nice mix of sizes. Realize these are single cable organizers (except for the one cord hanger) meaning the pieces appear to be designed to only hold a single strand of coaxial cable, or CAT 5 cable at a time. You might be able to run 2 or 3 smaller diameter cables through one of the larger pieces, but that would be tight.Pros: Great mix to start getting your cables organized.Cons: Generally only made to hold a single cable at a time. If you have larger cable runs, you should probably look for another solution."
4,not bad at all,"3 of the strips wouldn't stick, but they include extras. Easy to install and been working well for several weeks now."
3,"Good, not crazy strong","These cord organizers are great, but just because they are made by 3M doesn't mean they're going to complete miracles. The medium-sized ones in the pack are strong, but they aren't that strong. I had an extension cord I was trying to run through them and even though it fit in the cord holder, the holder didn't stay attached to the wall because it was a good, heavy extension cord. If you're running nice extension cords, consider buying just the large cord holder. One of the keys for using items like this is to clean the surface you're adhering them to, don't forget it!That being said, for small to medium sized cords these are great and come off cleanly."
4,Nice Variety,"Not sure if these are the best looking ties out there, but this pack includes a nice variety of adhesive cord ties. Useful for many applications. The different sizes allow for everything from USB cables to extension cords. A pack would be good to keep around the house or office. We buy two or three at a time and use all over the office to reduce clutter."
5,AMAZING!!,This is by far some of the most virtuosic brass music that I have ever heard in my life! I am still totally blown away every time I listen to this CD (and I've owned the CD for about 10 years now). Do yourself a huge favor and check out this recording.
5,Superior alternator for Samurai,"This is a brand-new, not rebuilt, alternator that fits the Suzuki Samurai, as well as other vehicles.I have been running one for about 8 months and it has been doing fine. The machine work is as good as OEM, and it puts out more current, 55 Amps, than the stock 45 amp alternator."
1,Painful To Read,I was so excited to buy this book. One of my favorite magazines had recommended it and I had also read the great reviews. Unfortunately I did not find myself roaring with laughter...not even a little giggle. I am now kicking myself for wasting the money. You want to buy something funny?....try any book except this one.
3,Has its moments,"Being an avid reader of McSweeney's, I expected a bit more from their comic writers. Overall, the book is pretty good and rife with subtle humor, but many of the lists are flat. Not a book that will make you roar out loud, by any means."
2,Weird Mountain Man,"Not what I was expecting. I found a book of lists, lists that were personal to the writer only, strange and non-factual lists. Very off-centered, quirky sorts of people will love this book."
5,"If you like this sort of thing, you'll love this","The lists in Mountain Man Dance Moves are like a joke that's gone off on a weird tangent and you and everyone else are dying laughing but no one can begin to explain why when a confused newcomer saunters up and asks, ""What's so funny?"" This is absurd, hilarious, random, inane, stealthily intelligent and often brilliant comedy writing. I'm buying a stack of these to give to friends for their birthdays."
5,Quirky and off-centered,"I want to (sincerely) thank the woman who gave this book two stars. While stating it was not for her, she advertised that ""Very off-centered, quirky sorts of people will love this book."" This is as admirable as someone saying, ""I found 'The Dark Crystal,' 'Labyrinth,' and 'The Neverending Story' too frightening, but if you liked them, then 'Coraline' is for you."" In that vein, if you find ""The Onion"" offensive, don't read this book."
4,"Ultra CAMP, Ultra GAY, Ultra LOUNGE......Ultra EVERYTHING!","Like Brini Maxwell on a bad trip, Charles Busch manages to slink his way through this absolutely HILARIOUS send up of 60's soaps (and bad Italian-funded movies) with a palpable air of sultriness and fun that I just haven't seen in ages. If you like your humor with more than a bit of a ""twisted edge"", you'll HOWL at this flick. Naughty? YOU BETCHA! This thing is SOOOO tongue-in-cheek ....and it's got some GREAT lines that are DESTINED to be, well, infamous! Just WAIT for the line about the brat with mustard! You will ROLL!!!!!!"
3,Funny in parts,"There are certainly some humorous moments in this odd little picture, but overall I'd say it's just a film made to showcase the talent of a drag queen to command attention. It was like watching a really bad soap opera."
2,Too long,"Charles Busch is not nearly as witty, funny, or passable as a drag queen as he thinks he is. I've seen every day men that make a better drag queen than Busch does in this film. Did he mean to have 5 o'clock shadow throughout 75% of the film? The movie had about six laugh out loud moments. The rest were forced groans at best. That opening sequence? Way too long. The cheesy motorcycle scenes. Chuckled the first time...(...)"
3,So-so parody of 50's tearjerkers,"As a fan of Charles Busch's work, I really looked forward to seeing this film. I have to admit I was not impressed. I've seen and directed many of Busch's stage plays, and while they are hysterical and fun when live and on-stage, they simply don't translate to film very well. Busch's portryal of Angela is outstanding -- strong yet almost pathetic; however, I felt it was one dimensional. No true highs and lows. After about 30 minutes or so, I kept hoping he would just let loose and go 'Joan Crawford' on us. The supporting cast, with the exception of Frances Conroy (Bootsie) were simply dull and lackluster. I couldn't help but feel that the actors weren't directed very well; they didn't capture the 'over-the-top' attitude that is a necessity in this genre (camp). Certainly, it is a beautiful cast, but I still didn't buy their performances. If you want to truly enjoy Busch's work, see it live and on-stage. Trust me, you won't be sorry!"
5,good cards,I bought these cards ... and they are good quality. Nice deck of cards especially if you are a fan of AMW TV show as all the criminals on these cards have been profiled on the show.
2,The Golden Ratio,"Not being inclined towards number mysticism, I found the book fuzzy and sluggish. Whether the golden ratio was or wasn't used in human construction or composition doesn't interest me, because I find no mystical meaning arising out of such use (much of the book is about how claims of its use are in fact wrong). The discovery of this ratio in nature, on the other hand, is interesting because the question arises of why it's occurring there. But the book isn't structured tightly and the author's meandering, even when ostensibly concerned with the golden ratio in mathematics or nature, frustrated my attention. It took me quite a while to finish it because it didn't hold my interest. Livio's final chapter on whether or not God is a mathematician doesn't bode well for his book on that subject."
3,A bit tiresome. The title seems misleading to me.,"I bought this book with a thirst to know about this number phi. I did learn about the number phi. However a large part of the book was devoted to instances where various people thought the number phi was present but the author spent considerable time developing the opinion or fact that phi was not influencing this or that particular instance. I got REALLY tired of that.For me, the first chapter and a half or so and the last two chapters were the meat of the matter for my interest. The book was worth it for the last chapter.I think that the author would have been better to write a book titled ""Why Is Mathematics So Effective?"" That seemed to be the central question that really drove the author.I don't regret reading it. I just feel it wasn't really the book I signed up for."
4,The Golden Ratio: A critical eye.,"A critical view of Phi, tracing mathematics from the pyramids to now. Particular attention is paid to Fibonacci numbers and Phi, both in natural occurrences such as patterns in the universe, plant life, and more, as well as man made occurrences.Funny that watchingNumb3rs - The Complete First Seasonafter reading this book destroyed the credibility of the math referenced in the show when the lead character mentioned The Golden Ratio being used in the Pyramids."
3,"Some very interesting, many dead ends","A lot of the early section about the history of mathematics, natural occurences, and the appearance of the phi is amazingly interesting.Unfortunately, Livio then proceeds on a wild goose chase to mention many of the instances in which people have presumed (generally incorrectly) that various artists, writers, and other such public figures used phi in their work.This book is certainly worth reading for the explanation of the origin of phi but I would recommend skimming the sections about artists, poetry, and musicians."
3,A little tiresome,"While the book is on solid footing mathematically and historically, the writing style can be a bit dry and merely analytical. The book never seems to catch and flow right. On top of which, the author tends to present other's ideas and dismiss them immediately, at times only presenting a paragraph to back up his claims, at other times being dry and textbook in its analysis."
2,A dry book best left for math nerds,"I liked the idea of learning more about math and numbers, and the history of such things. This book seemed promising at first, but the further along I went, the drier it became. There is a lot of advanced math that leaves a non-mathematician feeling like they are missing the punchline. The number that represents the golden ratio certainly has interesting properties, but I really don't feel like my life was enriched by knowing more about phi.Bottom line: too much ""technical detail"" for the casual reader that leaves one rather drowsy."
3,Not quite what you might expect,"Bought this after reading Da Vinci Code, and I was looking for more of the same. it is a little dry. It is a quick read though, and how much do you want to know about 1.618?"
5,Excellent & Unbiased,"This is a great book on phi. I like how Livio stayed objective and consistant throughout, disproving most of the New Age-y fluff sometimes associated with this number."
1,Fill the books with words but not with content,"I bought this book expecting to learn something about phi (mathematically). But it is not up to par. Compare with the other mathematical constant books (pi by Beckmann, i by Nahin, e by Maor, gamma by Havil), this book basically has no mathematical content. A book about a mathematical constant should be written by a mathematician."
2,Disappointing,"Lots of hype with relatively litle substance, more like a chapter in a larger book stretched out to book length."
3,An OK book...,"It presents an interesting topic on the 'golden number' the 'golden rectangle' and phi in general.It dispells many of the myths that ancient architecture and the use of phi before it was fully understood.However, it tends to be repetative and it does have some gramatical problems throughout.Interesting enough to keep you reading, but not the best book by any means."
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting a book that showed me where phi exists, not one that shows me where it doesn't exist. I agree that Dan Brown must not have read the book before endorsing it.There are some interesting points and the last couple of chapters are the best, but all in all I'm disappointed."
4,math history,"I was afraid when I got this book as a present that it would be some kind of new-age-hippy we're all ruled by PHI, ""It's in the trees man!"" kind of book.In fact, it was quite the opposite. It was a light hearted little adventure through math history and it was fascinating to read. Try it."
3,pretty boring,"Interesting subject, but written in such a boring fashion, I had to FORCE myself to finish it."
2,Awful,"The author takes pleasure in false claims against proven Egyption use of the Golden Ratio. His topic on fibonnacci in the stock market is poorly researched and falsely debunked. Phi is a fasinating number that inspires endless possibilities. This author does his best to take this wonderful attribute away from the reader. If you want to learn about Phi, do not read this."
4,The Signature of God,"The most irrational of irrational numbers (phi) can be found throughout the universe. Everything from the spirals of galaxies to the proportions of the human body and even the coils of DNA is proportioned on the Golden Ratio. Surely the ubiquitous nature of such a seemingly odd number is a sign of one of the preferences of the creative unfolding of the universe; none other than the signature of God, here for our amusement and assurance."
2,Shame,"Good idea, poorly executed. A collection of boring historical facts that won't fire the imagination. Couldn't finish it."
1,crap,"Buy this book if you enjoy dry, boring, off-topic, meandering and convoluted writing. Seriously, don't waste your time. INSTEAD, go out and buy A Beginners Guide to Constructing the Universe. Do a search for it right now."
2,TRIED to play a few times,My daughter gets frustrated and turns it off after a few minutes. She's 6. It's confusing to her. A total waste of money.
3,According to Viking's Rules...,"In my informal comparison of the transfer rate of 256MB compact flash cards by Viking, SimpleTech, and Kingston, the Viking card came in a distant third. The Viking card took about 40% longer to transfer identical data. My card at least, did not meet the stated specified transfer rate.So where speed of transfer is important, the Viking card may not be the best choice. For other less critical tasks, the Viking card has proven perfectly adequate.Viking products are competitively priced, [...]"
2,CF CARD ERROR!,"I have a Cannon S45 and loved the card up to the point it died. I was on Lake Tahoe for a friends wedding and had taken countless pictures and videos. All of a sudden, the camera froze up. The CF card error pops up and that's it. I've had 2 friends try the card in their cameras and the same thing happens... so I know it's not the camera. I won't buy another Viking...."
1,Dead in under 5 months,"I used the Viking 256MB in a Canon S45 camera and it worked great for 5 months and then died during a wedding. It will not reformat and various card readers can not read it. I have emailed Viking Componets, but they have yet to respond."
5,Love it,"I've had one of these cards from Amazon for over 5 months and it's preformance has been astounding. I use it with a D1 in heavy shooting situations and it has never failed to impress. It's very fast and reliable, an excellent controller design. So much so in fact that i'm going to be purchasing two more of them soon, and maybe some 512s in the coming year."
1,My CoolPix 4500 will not recognize this card,"I've seen several people complain that their cameras won't recognize this card. I even tried to format the card via a CF reader - no go. Copying everything from a working card couldn't fool the camera either.From what I understand this card *can* work in the CoolPix line, but as I said several folks (including me) report getting an un-usable card"
1,worked for a while,"I bought this card to go with my Nikon 4300. It worked fine for about 6 months. Now, although I can continue to take photos, I can't get them off the card my any means. PC can't read or even format the card.Don't waste your money here!As an update, I went to the Viking website and noted that they have a 5 year warranty. It was very easy to return, and Viking sent me a new one within a few weeks. So far, so good..."
1,This product is BAD!!!,"[...] After filling up the 256MB card with pictures, it went bad. Displaying a ""CF card error"" sign in the camera. It will not respond to any camera command. Nor will respond to a software program I purchased that recaptures lost or deleted information. I'm very upset and will not buy anything from Viking in the future...g on that their quality control is absolute crap. Go save yourself some heartache and order it from the company itself. I will never order anything from this website again and will advise everyone that i know to do the same. I emailed them about it and if they don't offer me some sort of compensation i am going to see if there is any legal action i can take, what an absolute outrage."
1,Will not format,I bought this card for my Minolta S404. The camera will not format this card. It says the card is not usable. Cannot format through my computer either. I am returning the card.
1,didn't last,"This card worked fine for a while, a couple of months, in my Minolta Dimage 7. Then, for no apparent reason, it would hold only a few more images than a SanDisk 64 MB card I have."
1,It died after 5 weeks.,"I thought a media card like this would be foolproof. No! I was on a hiking trip and took many pictures. All of a sudden, my camera could not function properly. After ""thinking"" for a long time, the camera showed ""CF Read Error"".I went home and plugged the card into the CF Card Reader. The light on the Card Reader was always on and Windows could not read it.I reached the conclusion that it must have died! It lost all my images!I have owned 3 other cards with smaller capacity of course. None of them gives me any problem! I will never go for this brand again."
5,Viking 128mb Flash Card,I've had it for almost a year. No problems whatsoever. I will be buying the 256mb from Viking shortly to prepare for a big trip.
2,Go with SanDisk,"And save money. I bought exactly the same Viking from Amazon.com one year ago, it worked flawlessly for about ten months, now I can take some pictures, but not all are read by USB card reader or even the camera itself. Reformatting didn't help. Have 256 meg SanDisk card - no issues so far, athough initially I bought it just because it was cheaper."
5,A lot of bang for the buck!,"I can't get over how many shots I can get on these cards! On my Olympus C-5050, I get 208 HQ shots. For the price (including rebate), I can't see how you can lose!"
2,good price poor quality,"I purchased the viking card for use with my new Canon 45s camera. I used it about 10 days when my camera flashed ""card error"" and I lost all my pictures. I went to the Viking web site where I found out how to return the card (they didnt even ask what was wrong with it) However that was almost 6 weeks ago and I still have not received a replacement. The website offers no way of checking on returns so I will have to call themto find out its status. I'm buying a Lexar today because something tells me I will have future problems (if I ever get a replacement from Viking."
5,Great Product...Congrats to Viking...,I got this card for a cassiopea BE-300 PDA and it works great!! I even downloaded some videos to it and the downloading speed was very good. I've taken my PDA to the beach and gotten some sand in it and the card and PDA of course still woked after i cleaned the sand off. I wish I had bought a 512mb instead but then again i was on a budget. Buy this card you wont regret it.
2,Think twice before you buy,"I decided to buy this card even after reading many negative reviews on how they stop working and corrupt your data. The card worked for about 6 months of very minimal use, before it self destructed losing all the data on it. The good news is that they seem to have a very efficient return/replacement policy since they do it so often."
1,Wrong Product,"When I ordered this product I thought that it would work in my camera, but it is to large. My camera takes a MMC/SD card. Can I return this Viking to you a get the correct card. Please let me know,I will be looking for your replay."
1,This card didn't work on my Canon S45,"I have read all good reviews on this card so I purchased one for my new canon S45. It worked fine with the first 40+ pictures. Then suddenly it stopped working: it took a very long time to read/write from/to the card, and when I plugged in to my computer to try to download my pictures, the card couldn't be read. I lost all my pictures on this card. I then reformatted this card, problem still existed. Maybe I'm the unlucky one to get a bad card? -:( But I don't want to take more chance on this card so I plan to return it."
1,work only once...,"i dont know if this product is a defect or not, but very disappointed. used on G3 once, then formatted it, and can never use again. camera cannot detect there's a flash card installed. when swapped with Lexar, it was working fine. when swapped back to Viking again, still could not detect. very disappointed. [...] talk about the quality of Viking.still got CF errors when trying to display the next images. Something went terribly wrong with the card. I formatted it and took several pictures. I would still get CF errors. I am using the 32MB card that came with the camera with no problems at all. I am now considering the Lexar 24x card or the new 40x card due out this month. I bought a 128MB Viking card for my son and he is having no problems with it at this time. I guess I just got a bad one."
3,qc,"use this card with my new Canon S410, it works fine. Use a generic card reader find out that this card is very slow, it's only about 400KB/sec. The card comes with S410 is about 1.3MB/sec."
4,Quick and big,Allows me to store up to 412 pictures at the highest quality setting on my Kodak DC3400 camera which is unreal. It saves the photos pretty quickly as well. Good buy.
1,Viking worked with me to reach a solution.,"After the second card was returned to Viking for the same 'corrupted files' errors I was about to give up. However Viking tech support suggested requesting two 128 mb cards vs another 256. Well, we haven't had any problems with these two cards. One we almost filled on a trip this weekend.Again, maybe there is a problem with Viking and Cannon with these 256mb cards."
1,Stopped working after only 2 days.,Like half the other reviews I've read here...my Viking 256MD card died after only using it for 2 days. It gives me errors and I'm unable to retrieve pictures off of it. I've also reformatted it and it still won't let me retrieve pictures. I tried reformatting it in another camera and took a few test pictures and it still can not get the pictures off the card.Sounds like Viking is having a serious defect with this card.
3,"Good, except for one problem","I have taken about 400 pictures on it. One picture had a memory card error on it... which I've heard some other people complain about. Fortunately it was a picture that I didn't care about. Aside from that one error, I have been happy with the product. [...]"
4,Card is good ...,"I got this card with my Canon S200 camera 4 months back. The card is working fine no problems at all. The card is very good, no doubt about it."
1,Poor Performance with Canon S230,"The Viking card has had numerous issues used on my Canon S230. The first card would 'drop' every 4th picture or so, displaying a 'CF Card Error' on the screen when later reviewed, which would render the image undownloadable. As you can imagine, I lost several precious shots due to this malfunction. I returned the card for a replacement, and have the same issue with the new one. I am very disappointed. The Lexar card I bought as insurance works just fine."
1,VERY UPSET,"I bought it, received it and had a ""cf card error"" message.I sent it back, they exchanged it to me by sending a new one, and still have a ""cf card error"".So verry unhappy from this component, hoping Viking let me trust them again one time.This comment is signed by the first 3 letters of my family name so that Viking can recognize from their archive the disappointed customer."
1,Stopped working after a few months,"This card worked great for about 4 or 5 months with no problems and I was very happy with it. Then, every so often, it would either fail to save a picture correctly, or pictures already on the card would get corrupted when new ones were taken. Now when I use it, about every 4rd or 5th shot is ruined. This is with a Canon S45. So, I'm quite unhappy with it and am forced to buy a new card. I wish I had ponied up the dough for a better card in the first place. I will probably try a Lexar or Simpletech."
1,Another one bites the dust....,"Not much to say. It performed fine for the first 60 days, but failed soon thereafter. Dead as a door nail. Thus far, no responses from the ""Superb Service"" nor ""the industry's best customer service policies including: a 5-year replacement warranty, guaranteed product compatibility, 24/7 toll free technical support, a liberal returns policy, and a 24-hour replacement policy in the unlikely event of a Viking product failure."" Unfortunately, a bit of a disappointment."
5,good value,"The 256MB card works fine in a Cassiopeia E-125.Note that 256MB means 256 million bytes, not 256 x 1024 x 1024 (268,435,456) bytes, which is what disk and memory manufacturers usually mean by 256 megabytes. So when you pop this card into your Pocket PC and it reports about 240 megabytes available, understand that the PC is using the 1024 x 1024 definition of a megabyte, not Viking's weird 1000 x 1000 definition."
1,Stopped working after 10 days,"I use this card in my Canon 10D digital SLR camera. After about 10 days it started to give errors when trying to preview my images. On some images it gave me ""Card error"" message, whereas on others it gave me ""Image too large"" message, even though I had viewed those images numerous times before, and they were not large at all.I bought this card because the tests on http://www.dpreview.com had shown that this particular CF card performs best on above-mentioned Canon camera."
2,I wouldn't buy this again,"Yes, it's big. Yes, it's cheap(er). No, it's not without it's problems. Very finicky with the Coolpix 5000. If the Coolpix 5000 turns itself off due to inactivity, when reawakening, MOST of the time, the camera reports that the card is not usable. I need to power off/on several times before it will work again.In my Coolpix 2100, it just doesn't work at all. Could be the Nikon cameras, rather than the Viking flashes, but if you have a Nikon, I'd sugest paying the extra 10-15% and buying a Lexar Media card."
1,Does not work well with Canon Powershot S50.,"I'm about to send for my second replacement for this Viking card. After filling up the card with pictures and video, it has given me the message 'memory card error' on both the original and replacement cards. Everything on the cards was lost.I tried Viking because it appears to be the best selling card on Amazon, so perhaps I've just had bad luck so far. But the Lexar Media CF256-12-251 256 MB, USB, 12X, High-Speed CompactFlash Card I bought has worked from day one with no errors."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought a 256 viking compact flash for my new canon s45, I felt the price was great for the product but that turned out to be false. I am very disappointed in the quality of the product, I have dealt with customer service several times. I am now on my 3rd card as they have replaced it each time. I keep having cf card error and corrupted images. That was a waste of money! For all the bad reviews I have read I have to agree that this is not worth trying and who wants to gamble losing your pictures. Its not a good deal when it doesn't work!!!"
5,Good all around card,"I purchased the card for my Minolta Dimage S404, and it is great. Even at medium resolution I can get over 500 pictures. You can't go wrong with this one - and why spend a few dollars more for a more ""popular"" brand ... and don't spend a couple bucks less for a poorer quality. One caveat: read your camera's instructions ... I mistakenly formatted my compact flash card in my computer, and now it won't work in the camera. Big NO-NO! Format in the camera only.BUT, GOOD NEWS! I have windows XP, and I found out from the manufacturer that all you have to do is hook up your card reader to a Win95 or Win98 machine and format it and guess what ...? IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!I still rate it 5 stars - it's one terrific piece of equipment. Now if I could just get my batteries to last longer in the camera ...."
5,VIKING CF256M COMPACT FLASH CARD,"I just purchased the Canon s40 digital camera and I purchased the 256 mb compact flash card from Viking. The card went into the camera smoothly and the number of pictures I can take on the highest level is amazing. I have owned Viking smart media cards for my other camera, and they have always performed well.I am pleased with their product line, and I will purchase from them again."
1,Way too dissapointed !!!,"I'm terribly dissapointed with this card. Unfortunately for me, I didn't read the reviews posted about this product because, since I own a Viking 128 MB Flash Card, I assumed a Viking 256 MB Flash Card would work as well. The thing is that the card died, like the other reviews said, displaying the ""CF Card Error"". This happened on September 1st, I tried contacting Viking on its website without an answer."
5,Wow!! Finally a high capacity compact flash card,"Here are the reasons why I like this card:1. The ability for me to shoot 24-30 images at the highest quality setting using my 3.3 Megapixel camera. I was also frustrated that each image, at the highest quality setting, was over 9 megs. Before I use to degrade the quality of the images in order to fit more on a card, but that is no longer necessary with this monsterous compact flash card.2. The quality in workmanship. It is made by Viking Components, a company known not only for it's superb reputation and customer service, but also for manufacturing the highest quality products.3. The price, as always ... knows how to partner with the best and then offer the lowest pricing."
1,Am I just unlucky?,"I bought this viking256M cf card before the Christmas for mySF vacation. I have been using a Scandisk 256M with my Canon G2for half year.Buy this card as backup.We took about 600 pictures.We don't have any problem with theScandisk card which holds 400 pics.But THIS Viking card sucks!First there are 3 or 4 pics which are ""corrupted"",I had todelete them to download the others.Then,There are 2 other witherror in card, which messed with the G2 software and caused18 pics.....I always read reviews before I buy anything online.Viking cardseems get pretty good reviews here in Amazon.It is unfair tosay the brand is ""bad"" just because of one time experience.But,it is enough for me."
2,CF Errors,This card worked fine for 2 weeks in my Canon S45. I was able to take an increased amount of pictures and movies. Speed was very good. Then after taking 61 pictures and 2 movies at a party I got download errors on several files. Luckily I got all but 2 pictures downloaded. When I reviewed the images using the camera I got CF Errors on several images. I deleted these images and still got CF errors when trying to display the next images. Something went terribly wrong with the card. I formatted it and took several pictures. I would still get CF errors. I am using the 32MB card that came with the camera with no problems at all. I am now considering the Lexar 24x card or the new 40x card due out this month. I bought a 128MB Viking card for my son and he is having no problems with it at this time. I guess I just got a bad one.
1,"horrible, horrible qulity, get away from this card!","I bought this card last summer for my canon S200 camera. It supposes to be able handling 350 pics. But I can only take 100 pics with it, over that number the camera says ""CF card error"". I found this problem two months after I got it since I didn't have chance to take many photoes with it. It was too late to return the card. I hate it. I will never try Viking again."
2,It's not a reliable card,"Despite of the negative reviews, I ordered this card from amazon.com because the relatively low price. At the first the card was ok, I took about 100+ pictures without problem. After a month the card started showing CARD ERROR on some pictures, I was naive enough to keep taking pictures with it. Well, on the day 3 of a trip, the card totally stopped working. I lost all the pictures on it!After the trip I returned the card to Viking and got a replacement. I hope the new card will be fine. I also did a search and found that it is said Viking cards with model number xxxxxxxxMLC are more likely to have CARD ERROR problems. Unfortunately, both my old card and the replacement are this type.Update: As of today 2-7-2005, the replacement card has shown same CARD ERROR in 3 out of 4 trips we had. Although I could use an image recovery software to save lost pictures, the card itself is so unreliable I decide to stop using it."
2,Does not work in 2 devices out of 3,"Well, the compatibility is not that great. This card refused to work in my Nikon CoolPix 800 camera (though this camera is on compatibility list at Viking Web site) and MP3plus MP3 player. New card I've received from Viking as a replacement shows the same behaviour. Both devices work perfectly with about a dozen of CF cards by other manufacturers (none of them is 256MB card, though). This card works with Canon PowerShot A70, where I ended up using it."
2,Doesn't Last Long,"I am on my second Viking card. My first lasted about a year and died, slowly losing a few pictures here and there and then an entire Christmas full of pictures before I had a change to upload them on my computer. Viking replaced the first card no problem, but I'm still out the pictures and now the new card doesn't work after about eight months of use. I don't know if this is normal for all cards, but at the price I originally paid (about $45), it really stinks.UPDATE: My second card started dying after about 6 months of use."
5,Viking 256MB for Nikon 2500,"This CF worked just fine in my Nikon 2500. On the fine setting, I can take well over 200 pictures, on the normal setting over 500 pics!!! Can't beat the price."
1,Wrong memory card,This item was offered as a promotuonal item included with the purchase of a Nikon P2 coolpix camera.However the compact flash memory card does not work with this camera only SD memory card.This a mistake made by amazon obiously I took it because I though that it worked with the camera. I have noticed that you have made a correction and in the latest promotion the SD memory card is offered.Amazon should replace this card since I have not use for it.Thanks for the opportunity of being able to make this comments
2,"Great card, but major compatibility issues","When I got my card I was excited to find that it really is very well made compared to the other cards I've used. And it had a much better price. I had read of problems with some cameras but mine seemed okay. And it was great, until I filled the card up completely for the first time and ended up losing 372 photos. I wanted to like it, because it really does seem like it's a lot higher quality than other brands. But if it doesn't work it's not terribly useful. I'm dissappointed now. I'm returning the card, it's back to SanDisk for me.."
3,Not comfortable on my feet,"These looked and felt comfy at first, but after walking in them for 15 minutes, they hurt my feet. A little too bouncy and squishy.....made my ankles tired after a short time. I returned them."
5,Fantastic shoe,This shoe is really more like wearing a slipper. The workmanship is fantastic. I love them and will order more.
4,From Bethlehem to Clavary,Looking for a fresh view on the life of Jesus? This is a stunning persceprive written in the 1930's - very refreshing!
3,Stale bars not as good as fresh,"I highly recommend Balance Bars; however, Amazon sent me outdated bars and cannot figure out whats going on."
1,Quacker Factory flying low,"Once upon a time Jeanne Bice's success story was inspirational. Over the years her continued collaboration with QVC caused my loss of respect for this wonderful lady. She sold jeans with malfunctioning zippers. Greed and the need for ""the almighty dollar"". I watched a terrific lady with wonderful ideas become a shill for QVC. The book has wonderful stories and insight. It is sad that she continues to bond with QVC."
5,Hardwood pocket screw,Would not use anything but keg products in my shop. Would highly recommend any of their products that require great close and strong connection.
3,An Avid Golfer,"The video is not worth the price. It has 3-4 excercises to loosen up, and a message to practice half/quarter swings. When the video was finished, my first thoughts were - That is it !!"
1,A Scam,"Worst ""golf"" video I've seen. I'd be embarased to let my buddies know I bought it. The guys ""katas"" and ideas are possibly good for a very early beginner but otherwise will be a waste of time for anyone with an any idea of how to play.I fully respect the martial arts, being a student of Karate for severeal years but this crosses the line. He might have improved it had he taken some time to break down various parts of the swing or reasoning for telling us what he does. His idea that the whole swing starts from the shoulders in WRONG!Find something else to spend your money on."
1,Like fingernails on the blackboard,"I purchased this video based on the positive reviews. Watching it was like listening to fingernails on a blackboard. It was awful. After I watched it, I went back and re-read the reviews and can't understand how anyone could have enjoyed watching the tape or have learned anything from it. It was basic basic. It may be OK for a 120+ index, but anyone who shoots less will not learn much from it. It was definitely a low budget video of the home-made variety. If you want a video that will deliver what this one proposes, try the Eight Step Swing by Jim McLean. It's a professionally made video you can watch over and over without tiring and you'll get something out of every viewing."
1,"The work out is great, but DVD is awful","I love this work out and did it on VHS for years. Gave me a 6 pack. I thought it would be great to move it to DVD. I pruchased the DVD and found out that you can't skip to any of the 5 work outs!!!!! It's a waste of the technology. It's actually easier to just leave the VHS tape right where it is, so that when you are ready to do day 1 or day 2 or day 3, you can just start the tape where you left it. With the DVD you have to fast forward through all the previous work outs and that gets old fast. The only other alternative is to leave the DVD on pause the whole time. It would be great if they would just include chapters."
5,Simply the Best!,I had this in video form many years ago and wanted the cd version. The Firm productsare absolutely the best hands down. The ordering process was flawless.
3,Awesome ab workout!!!,"This dvd is truley an awesome ab workout. Stick with it and get more like it if you get bored with the same old easily. It's nice that there are 5 days of workouts. You can combine them when you get stronger. I'm really happy with my purchase. Here are the reasons that I didn't give it a full 5 stars... You have to fast forward to get to the other workouts. You cant just ""skip"" because it's not an option. Also the people look silly in their swimsuit/tights get up with ankle socks. And the music is a bit outdated and silly too. These things don't bother me though as long as I get what I wanted out of it, which is a great ab workout! And I do. For the ladies that thought they'd finally have a hot guy to workout with... It's a scam. The guy on the cover shows you how to start a position and then you workout with a group of people... he doesnt even join them. haha. Anyhow overall this was sooo worth the money!"
5,great gift choice,bought this for my daughter for christmas to replace the same video her older sister owned and had left at the house. the older sister took hers home and the younger begged me to replace it because she had been using it regularly and loves the workout.
3,An utter pulp novel,"If you know the series, you will either be deeply amused, or deeply horrified by the characterizations and plot, although both are somewhat plausible in a frightening way. At times it reads like a well-written fanfiction, with off-the-wall plot ideas thrown in just because it seems a little neat. However, my suggestion would be to read the book in a less than serious manner, and you'll probably enjoy it a lot more.Really, it's just cheezily beautiful."
3,decent book,I bought this book because I usually enjoy body swap stories. This book didn't disappoint. The X-Men felt true to their comic book counter-parts and everything felt in character. I enjoyed the setting and the premise but I was a little let down that not much time was spent on the villains. The biggest weakness in the book was that I didn't feel the villains had a strong enough motivation for their actions.The book kept me turning pages which is good but it fell a little flat for me overall. Those looking for hyper super-hero action will be disappointed. The book is more of a character study.
2,Interesting Idea. Poorly Executed.,"While this book had an interesting premise it fails on the execution. The focus on the 5 X-Men while in the mental hospital got a bit boring. The action and exciting parts of the book are brief and at the end. Also, the ""villian"" of the story is woefully underdeveloped."
3,Not up to par with the rest of the series,"This video introduces the cast and set for the Blue House series and plods along with a weak plot to do this. The songs are also below average, with the ""What's in the Mail Today?"" song being particularly annoying for many younger children (uses ""blue"" notes). No real learning takes place for the children, except for the ""Dear Gramma Flutter"" song (the only strong part of the entire video). A ""good"" video overall, but not worthy of the rest of the series. The kids NEVER request to see this one."
1,Poor Quality VHS Tape!,"The content of Bear in the Big Blue House #1 is great, but beware of the questionable quality of the tape. I bought this VHS tape to replace a tape I borrowed from a friend, that my 2 year old son damaged. The friend's copy (black label, with same information as the Amazon Tape) had an excellent picture quality and sound. The tape I bought from Amazon.ca had a different label (white), and much less tape. The quality of the picture was of very poor quality, compared to my friend's copy. Buyer beware!"
4,Interesting Medical Mystery,I really enjoyed this book. D.T Max manages to hit the right balance between heavier scientific and historical information against the personal narrative of people who've experienced familial insomnia first hand. I found it to be a page turner.
4,"So good, I couldn't sleep...","I love reading about interesting medical cases and diseases, so a book about prions is right up my alley. This was incredibly fascinating and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes medical mysteries and wants to stay up reading all night and having anxiety attacks.My only complaint was a bit too much rambling."
5,Engrossing,This book is a well written mix of scientific detail/development alternating with anecdotal effects of the prion diseases. I couldn't put it down.
5,A Good Read,"This is a really good book on the history of Prion disease. The author does a good job of accurately presenting the basics of the science behind prion diseases in a way that is accessible to lay people and does a great job in presenting the epidemiological work that went into tracking down the cause of the various prion diseases. He also does a good job of putting a ""face"" to the disease in tracking the history of one form of prion disease, fatal familial insomnia through and its impacts on one family through the course of generations."
3,"Prion parts good, other parts sort of ramble","Overall the parts of this book that discuss the identification of prions, the finding of Kuru in Papua New Guinea, the descriptions of the fast times of Daniel Gajdusek, etc, were quite fascinating, well written, and flowed nicely. I was less interested in the author's personal struggle with a neurodegenerative disorder (which is not even a prion disease)--it didn't really fit the rest of the book. So, in summary, quite good, but not great."
3,Favorite Mittens - Hansen,Favorite mittens is a classic basic mitten book. You can start with this book and embellish your projects to make them your own. It is also nice to know the history behind the mitten designs shown in the book.
1,Very Specialized Book (Useless),"I thought I was buying a book of usable mitten patterns, especially based on the attractive cover. Well, the mittens are very specialized techniques made by old-time Maine knitters. Nothing even slightly appealing to me. Returning book immediately."
4,nice,"This is a nice selection of good warm mittens that we had when we were kids. My Mom made these mittens and donated several pairs to the church bizarre every year where they sold out usually before they landed on the table.There is a nice bit about the wool for these mittens in the book but over time, Mom started making them with regular 4ply acrylic so they were machine washable, toasty warm and unlike anything you can but in a department store, I hope with the detail in this book I may learn to make them nearly as well as my Mother did."
3,Hard for little ones to use,"This wasn't exactly what I had hoped for. It's tricky to get everything lined up correctly. I was hoping to use this to get my 5-year-old more motivated to draw and trace, but he isn't willing to take the time to get it to work. It's harder than using tracing paper on a light box.This might be great fun for a child who already likes to draw and trace and who has the patience to adjust the panels to the correct angles and keep them there. That just doesn't describe my son."
3,MUCH better than Digi-draw!,"Although I'm not a kid (in fact I'm a grown woman), this was given to me as a gift to help out with my (very small) art skills. I agree with the previous review. This DOES take patience (and some practice) to master, but it isn't impossible. Also, it's WAY WAY better than Digi-draw, for the Magic Tracer is simple to put together, the trace mirror/reflector stays in place, and you can easily adjust it to help you out even more. The ONLY bad thing about the Magic Tracer is that it come with JUST ONE trace mirror/reflector, meaning if you break it...you're screwed! So be sure to take good care of it. ^_^"
2,Difficult to use,"I bought this for my daughter, who was very excited, but couldn't get the hang of the reflector. In fact, you have to look through the reflector and trace without looking directly at your hands....so 5 years might be a little young for this. She ended up just coloring the pictures that came with it. I think we'll put it up until she's older."
2,Tough!,I remembered using something like this when I was young and had fun with it but this one was way to tough for my seven year old. He ended up storing papers in the case.
5,Love,These work as they are supposed to and I love having the customized colors. Would order again if I needed more!
5,DELIGHTFUL,THIS IS WONDERFUL STORY ABOUT A FUN BIRTHDAY PARTY. IT FEATURES CHARACTERS FROM OTHER BOOKS BY THE SAME AUTHOR. MY PRESCHOOL STUDENTS LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!
4,Just like the others,"Very cute book, in the same vein as the other ""If You"" books. My granddaughter loved it."
5,Selfish?...No way.,"The pig in this book is just like most small children, moving from one whim to another in a the steam of consciousness way that children live their lives. My daughter loves this book. I think it would also be a good read for new parents as well since it shows the constantly changing attention span and imagination that makes childhood so fascinating."
5,"Another great ""If you Give A...."" Book...",This book certainly doesn't disappoint! My kids fall onto the couch laughing everytime we read it. The illustrations are great and they love all the characters together in one book! A definite 'must read'!!!
5,"If you give a mommy an ""If you give a pig a party"" book...","...chances are she will enjoy storytime as much as her little one! Sorry, I just love all of Laura Numeroff's books...and this is one that I do not mind reading 3 times in a row. :)"
3,"Pale imitation, stick to the original ""If You Give a Mouse a Cookie""","There's no reason to get this book unless you are a *big* fan of ""If You Give a Mouse a Cookie."" This story follows the same basic format, with a pig that has to have balloons with her party, and this leads to more and more. But, it lacks the panache of the original; there's just not the same spark. The chain of events is a bit more strained, with the sequence making less natural sense than the original. And there's not even the same smooth flow to the words as you read them aloud.My children also prefer the original (with the exception of the girl who was given a stuffed pig along with this book!). I would only rate this book a 3; it's not bad, but it's not particularly good. By comparison, I'd rate the original a 4.5. My recommendation is just to skip this book and stick with ""If You Give a Mouse a Cookie."""
3,"Ok, but the Mouse series is better","I did not enjoy these books as much as the Mouse series. The Pig comes off as being really selfish, whereas the Mouse is really sweet, and the ""if this, then this, then this"" story lines in the Pig series are all over the place and don't really flow."
3,Not as good as the others,"I feel like the author is really having to work at these stories now. Mouse, Moose and Pig/Pancake are great, the stories make sense and they are fun. This doesn't make sense to me, it doesn't flow and it seems forced to come back full circle to the beginning. The others were much better. This is not as bad as If You Give a Cat a Cupcake, that is just awful, this book is just south of mediocre. If it had not come in a set, I would not have purchased it."
1,A Trip into Fantasy Land,"This book claims to be an accurate presentation of the ""Okinawan Diet,"" but the elements of that supposed diet are a far cry from reality. I live in Hawaii where there is a large Okinawan community (including first, second, third, etc., generations) and I have many friends who were raised in Okinawa. Believe me: Their diet is anything but ""low-fat"" as this book claims.Okinawans are known for their preference for fatty pork and they principally use lard in their cooking--nothing low fat here I can assure you. They do eat vegetables, rice, fish, and those delicious purple potatoes, but the mainstay of Okinawan cuisine is pork.This book is simply a politically correct re-writing of the actual evidence done by the Spin Doctors of modern nutrition. You're better off getting Fallon & Enig's book ""Nourishing Traditions,"" or Allan and Lutz' book ""Life Without Bread.""CAVEAT EMPTOR!"
5,Excellent recipes,The book is a good read and full of interesting insights into the Okinawan way. I especially liked the recipes and have tried a few of them. I must disagree with the spammer who wrote the negative reviews(he unsuccessfully pretends to be 3 different people). The recipes do not contradict the earlier findings in the book.
5,Excellent Diet Plan with Rationale to Back Itself,"Having traveled to Okinawa some time ago, I was fascinated with their culture and the attribute of their culture to live extremely long, healthy lives. Originally I came across this book when searching for a cookbook only and ended up buying it in conjunction with their recipe book. Both are extremely useful in relaying exactly why certain foods and eating practices are beneficial and I would highly recommend the pair of them to anyone who is looking for a significant change to a healthier lifestyle, has wanted answers to questions about food nutrition and its effects, or has simply been to Okinawa and fell in love with their cuisine."
3,something we did not already know about??,"The okinawa Program is a good dietary health guide, with some great ,low in saturated fat, meals, however, what red blooded american has three-four hours to spend cooking in the kitchen.allot of the meals require allot of time to make...who has that kind of time anymore.Lots of fruits, veggies, soy and a diet low in saturated fat with lean meats and a healthy lifestyle....I don't get it...what don't we already know here.i doubt very much if the Okinawans have the same day to day pressures as we do here in the United States."
3,Okinawa Program - some reservations,"The Okinawa Program is a thoughtful study of some of the world's longest living people. There is much to commend this book. Exercise, eating to only 80% capacity, mental outlook, etc. However some factors are worrying. The authors suggest that Westerners reading the book should use Canola Oil for its high Omega 3 content. Unfortunately they do not seem to realise that Canola Oil is actually rapeseed oil under a new consumer friendly name. Rapeseed oil has been condemned in many studies for the harm it does to the human body. Similarly in promoting the eating of soy foods, the authors omit to warn of the detrimental effects to the human brain of eating too much soy which again have been highlighted in scientific studies.A little more objectivity would have been appreciated in an otherwise thoughtprovoking book."
4,Okinawa Program,"Even though the Okinawan diet would be hard for a westerner to follow it is still an excellent book on nutrition and overall lifestyle. Chapters on fitness, stress and aging were very informative and are easy to put into practice."
4,Okinawa food come from China,"Okinawa was a part of China, before Japan occupied. So, their food basically Chinese food. Therefore, they live longer than Japanese."
5,Canola oil is not rapeseed oil by another name,"In response to a prior reviewer, canola oil is not rapeseed oil by another name. It's true that rapeseed oil does have harmful effects on the body partially due to its erucic acid content which can be quite toxic. However, canola oil is actually a type of rapeseed plant bred by Canadian horticulturists (hence the name ""canola"" for Canadian oil) to contain low levels of erucic acid. Canola oil's healthful properties are well documented especially in the Lyon study where a number of heart attack victims did better on a ""mediterranean"" diet which included canola oil and canola oil products relative to a typical American diet for heart attack victims (e.g. low-fat). Canola oil is a derivative of rapeseed oil. But it should not be mistaken for the latter's health risk since canola oil has a much lower erucic acid content (less than 5 percent) than rapeseed oil does."
2,Not worth the price,"We set it up when we received it. It didn't read the temp. correctly. saying it was 90 when it was only 67. The next day it was the same, also didn't light up at night so that you could read it."
5,Quick and Easy!,After using another paper towel holder on the counter that you had to unscrew everytime you changed the roll I decided to get this one. EASY! Just pop the roll on and you are done. Roll doesn't spin - you just unravel what you want and tear. I use the paper towels with the smaller divisions and with this holder you don't waste so much. Great little towel holder.
5,Get Calm Today ~c:),"I just wanted to write a quick review to let readers know that I recommend this book highly! At the end of 1999, I was working in a very stressful environment. Five people were working in a very small space manning an online retail store during holiday season! Yikes!Withink two days of reading the book, I not only was able to cut my own stress down substantially, but some of the techniques I used (the positive contribution cup) changed the entire office environment for the better.I cannot recommend this book enough, especially for people working in the highly stressful high tech field.Read, enjoy and relax!~c:)"
1,why?,"i don't know why i bought this purse, its very ugly. its a lot smaller than i thought it would be, too."
1,Penstemons,"I bought this book because my boss has a copy of it. However, he must have an older copy because this contained NO color photographs. It is difficult enough to identify penstemons with color photos, but it is almost impossible without. This wouldn't help in the identification process at all."
5,An indispensable guide and reference for gardeners.,"Packed with color photos and botanical illustrations is this intriguing guide to penstemons, outlining a wide range of species both common and rare. Enjoy a range of choices which can be used in both dry and marshy gardens across the country, concluded by a mail order source guide."
2,Madden 2000: Superbowl or Bust?,"I was really looking foward to getting this book only to be disappointed. The strategic information included was way to general in nature and the player ratings incomplete ( where were the ratings for the superbowl, all-time and pro-bowl teams?) OK, all the codes are included and thats nice, but this book was a little too light on strategy to suit my tastes. For rookies it my be a good source of general information. Anyone looking for some indepth strategies should look elsewhere."
4,complete.,"I read this book for an Arab politics class this year.It is written by an Israeli, so inevitably there is a slant. However, Israelis understand Arab and Islamic politics better than anyone else in the world, including the Arabs themselves. It is essential to their survival.It details the power structure of Iraq's tribes, it explains Saddam's motivations and shows that they are indeed rational, etc.I highly recommend this policy paper in book format."
1,Not the right part! Part numbers listed incorrectly online,Product arrived on schedule nicely protected. When I opened the package and held the unit up to the dash it was obvious that it was the wrong part. There is obviously a problem somewhere because I ordrered the correct part for my car the part number that was shipped matched what I ordered. But the packaging listed a s80 instead of a v70.
3,Good book - if you like a history of how great a man was,"This book is a pretty good read. I am a big reader of business biographies (Starbucks, Walmart, McDonalds, Blockbuster, John Malone, Diller, etc). What I had hoped for in this book was more insight and background on Larry Tiches other deals. This one focussed mostly on CBS and was not written in any exciting fashion. Having said all that - I did enjoy it but would only give it three stars."
4,Excellent value for the money,"Having purchased similar items in retail stores, these pocket squares are great value for the money. It makes one wonder how regular stores can still charge up to $15 for the same thing.C.B."
5,Play it again and again,Memories relived by all in my family! My five yr old enjoys it as well. It arrived quickly and in great condition. Takes us back it time every time we turn it on.
5,Downright awesome ass game,"Gaie is one of the greatest RPG games i have ever played. You start as a young boy named Will and you set out on a journey to find your father. You soon aquire 2 more companions: a knight and a firey spirit dude. I would definently reccomend this game to any RPG and adventure game fan because this game has a deep storyline, cool bosses, challenging puzzles (especially the last one), fun side quests, and the gameplay is just fun. The only downside to this game is the last boss. She is a giant amazonian chick who is very, very, very hard. But after a couple hundred tries I eventually beat her"
5,Very Pleased,"I ordered the game not really expecting to have ""Everything"" in the box, even though it had said ""Complete"" but this has got to be the best buy's i have ever made. The Game was Mint, box and manual are fine, it even had the StarFox poster, Map of Illusions Of Gaia, AND everything else it came with. 10 out of 10 in my book for sure. Shipping was also very fast. Thanks again Ethan"
2,Disappointed,I was very excited to get this book because I have loved the other Kathy Ross craft books but I found that I was disappointed in this one. The thanksgiving series was just dull I thought. I was hoping for variety in the decorations. These just did not appeal to me like her other books.
5,Sweet Little Javelina!,"In some parts of our great country these little critters abound-thus, I, as grampa to a bunch of sweet grandchildren-have provided a very nice toy for each of them to have and to hold. This Javelina is well made-pretty accurate to the real thing- reasonably priced and can be cuddled by young and old alike! As they hold this little guy-I read the story of 'The Three Little Javelinas.'-Great little toy! (Of course-You do not want to 'cuddle' the real thing-though-be careful- they are wild critters!)"
1,Careful! Two versions on same listing - buy the right one!,"This page has information about both an English-only version of the book and a French version with English translations. I ordered the English-only after reading the reviews that were about the French/English version! What a waste.The French/English version is here:Best Short Stories / Les Meilleurs Contes (A Dual-Language Book) (English and French Edition).I'm not certain the purpose of putting these two different versions together, but obviously I should have been paying more attention."
5,"Imaginative and ""mundane"" ,then and now.","Guy De Maupassant hit a chord and in its delivery he left nothing too far fetched. All of his ""stories"" were ""cloned"" from actual everyday common ocurrences. He knew that reality was stranger than fiction, all he had to do was to pass it on, with the well seasoned ingredients of someone that had not ever lived a dull moment. He was from Normandy, my ancestors birthplace in France and I in my puberty gained access to my father's ""private library"" and the literary works by such an author, using a screwdriver to pick the locks, that is why I had to read the English translations to check on its contents and refresh my memory with those wonderful stories, yet said book is now in the hands of those who's failed to treasure it."
3,Size is disappointing,"Tokyo Bay Red Tango Weekend Bag / Airline BagI am disappointed with the size of this bag. It should only be labeled a laptop bag and not a weekend bag. It'll only work for me because I also bought the carry on bag by Red Tango. It makes a cute combo but would not suffice alone to pack for a weekend trip. Also, it doesn't have padding to be a laptop bag. The design of course is cute. Unfortunately some of the sellers must pack them without padding before sending them out which leaves creases in the vinyl. Still a good buy, but should really be priced around $40."
3,It's ok,The bag was smaller than I thought it would be. More importantly though is that it didn't ship on time and I wasn't told there would be a delay.
5,"Saw it, hadn't heard it, bought it, Loved It.","Joy Lynn has always remained consistent so when I came across the cd at Circuit City years ago I picked it up completely unheard. She is a great songwriter and picks great songs by others. Just a Girl is one of the most heartbreaking songs of all time and speaks to society's shallowness.I loved ""Looking for You, Looking for Me"" immediately but didn't realize how prophetic it would turn out to be. I played it for my now husband, who is not much a country music fan, he got tears in his eyes (which is not easy to do) and he agreed that we needed to have it as the first song for our civil union. The song really defined how our lonely world's came together: ""Life can turn on a dime, and the love that I've searched for I may soon find, It may very well be, while I was Looking for You - You were looking for me."
4,It is a good game!,"Well I hink it is a really good game , but you do kind of repeat each level. Each level the object is the same thing. You have to get from where you started to a door hat takes you to the next level."
1,Not a good game...,"I PERSONALLY don't think this game is fun because your constanly just going through different worlds...i know your thinking what is so boring about that, well i think it's boring because you are practically reapeating yourslef when you go throuhg each level! it isn't like pokemon...you don't really talk to anyone, and the object is to get to the door leading to the next level and then you start over again until you reach the next door and so on... games like pokemon and bomberman you interact with characters and can go anywhere and are (i think) much more intresting and are a lot more fun! well that all i have to say."
3,Good game unless............,I don't recomend this game over the age of 9 because you could be in for a big waste of money
4,Pinobee: Wings of Adventure,"Pinobee is a cute little bee with attitude. He's fun to play and easy to move around. At first I thought the game was no big deal but when I had finished it the first time I realized that that was only one of the endings. There are more! Now I have played it all twice and this time I made it to other levels that wasn't there the first time. And yet there are more endings to it. How many there are I don't know yet. This game is great as you can play it all over again and get a different story. At first I also thought it was easy but if you really want to beat the game it takes awhile and there's plenty to do. So it is not just for kids (actually, it might be too difficult for some), I'm 28 and I'm having a great time with it. So check it out, it is worth it. The more you play the more you get into it and you'll realize that you can play this game for a long time. And the graphics... Fantastic!!! If you like Rayman you'll like Pinobee too!"
5,Great Game,I got this game for my b-day. Once I started to play it I did not want to put it down. Sometimes the background looked 3-D. As you go along looking for the door to go to the next level you collect flowers. It is fun for boy's and girls. I t is really fun to play!! Don't be fooled by the title or cover!!
3,Pinobee,"this game was not the best i've ever played, yet it was not the worst. this is a game focused toward younger players. some older kids may like it but its still childish. i do not own this game but my friend has it and i've only played it twice. in my opinion this game was not very chalenging yet i an an experienced gamer. i've been playing games since i was 3. over all dont dismiss this game right away. check around and see if you can play it for your self before you get an opinion on it."
1,Fell apart after two days,"I've bought about half a dozen of these notebooks, and each one fell apart within a week of purchase. Completely useless."
4,Decent fighting game,"For all the arcade-style fighting games in its day, this game was fair in storyline and quality. The artwork/graphics are nice, but this game just didn't have the kick that Mortal Kombat did. It's still a decent fighting game and is good for a couple of hours of entertainment."
5,ULTRA COMBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,Man Killer instinct is such a great game and the port for the snes was well done this series deserves a revamp come on RARE lay off the Xbox Kinect games and come back to the games that made you GOLD!!!!
5,Sideline Review,"If unconventional mind-f'in industrial music with balls, beats, grooves and a sense of humour is your cup of tea, Krushed Opiates are the new masters in the genre!! To hell KMFDM & co with their current walls of noise and heavily distorted vox, DSBP found a very talented gang who bring back the right balance between heavy industrial and coldwave melodic tunes. ""Driving The Two-Dimensional"" is a crazy cocktail of abused and looped (female especially) vocal samples, groovy beats, hip hop rhythmics and technoid synths. A very promising combo that will be welcome with open arms by the crowdy fans of Chemlab, good old KMFDM or yet SWAMP TERRORISTS on a gentler day. Worthy of examination. Get your brain Krushed!!"
4,My first introduction to Mega Man,"This was the first Mega Man game I ever got. The difficulty was hard, but not nearly as impossible as some other reviewer mentioned. The shots do tend to be slower than on its NES counterpart, but it's amazing how well it's transferred to the Game Boy's small screen. Very fun and very challenging, with an excellent ending as well! Heartily recommended to Mega Man fans."
1,Terrible.,"I won't talk about the paganini, as I already reviewed that album (and it was awful). As for the rest of the works on this disk, anyone who knows anything about classical music or anything about the fundamentals of guitar playing will quickly realize that Fisk falls embarrassingly short on so many levels it's ridiculous. There are certain standards of acceptable interpretation, rhythmic accuracy, cleanliness (there are MISTAKES on this CD!!), and tone quality, all of which Fisk grossly fails to meet. The unfortunate thing is that the guitar community as a whole doesn't seem to care about these things. If Fisk played any other instrument, he would not have a career. If you want to hear these pieces played well, I suggest you try David Russell, Manuel Barrueco, John Williams, Jason Vieaux, Pepe Romero, or Paul Galbraith. The difference between these players and Fisk is obvious."
1,Eliot Brisk,"Eliot Brisk's just a bit too focused on flash over substance, as evidenced by his paganini album. He's a very accomplished player without doubt, but his tone is really poor. I couldn't agree with ""terrible""'s review more. Check out Williams, Galbraith, Barrueco, Russell and of course the real Segovia, not the ersatz one."
1,There are few,"There are few people talented enough to play Caprices (24) for violin solo on the guitar, Eliot Fisk is not one of them, he cannot play the notes to alot of this peice in time, so just he plays it freetime? and leave out the parts altogether he is unable to play! I do not recommend this cd"
1,I was very disappointed with this DVD,"I thought I was buying a DVD that showed how to do Dr.Berceli's Trauma Release Exercises .The interview of Dr.Berceli is okay, but I was very disappointed because there was no demonstration of the exercises.It is just talk."
4,Great purchase!,"The Zen V is a very user friendly device. I have never owned a MP3 player before and had no trouble using this one. The programs are simple and putting songs on the player is very easy. It is small and can fit in your pocket. You may need to get a new set of ear phones, the ones that it came with were rather large and I could not use them. Other than that, an awesome product."
3,zenV review on two,"I actually bought 2 of these for my kids at x-mas..while 1 is still working great , the others screen has gone black and am in process of trying 2 discover why..if any1 else has had this problem and may know a remedy plz respond..greatly appreciated..as far as the functions..on both they have alot of diff. activities you can perform..like i said the only prob. is with the screen going out on the 1......ronaldroycebanks@yahoo.com"
1,Not Recommended,"I had a similiar experience as another reviewer with this item. I purchased this player for my wife for Christmas. The player worked very briefly, then it went blank. It never worked again and I returned it for a refund."
3,A three and a half star mp3 player...,"The ZEN V has agreat song capacity, a cool look and great features. One of the bad aspects of this is that it freezes when you use the contoler to fast. As long as you use it at a normal speed it won't freeze(that's at least what I noticed). Also, for some reason my screen is a bit scratched even though they claim to have a scratch resistent screen.....hmmm. Other these few faults this has been an over all great mp3 and I would reccomend it."
3,The Zen is OK but it freezes alot,I really like my mp3 player but it freezes up alot. I don't know why mine freezes because my sister and friend have the same kind and their's never freeze. today it froze up and i couldn't get it to unfreeze even when i pushed the reset button. I looked on the Creative website and it said what to do but i had to deleat all my songs that were on it. It's a really cool mp3 player and it works most of the time but i wouldn't buy it if you don't want to have to fool around with unfreezing it.
1,DONT GET THIS,"The player freezes with no sound and with the screen on , at random times and for no apparent reason. My one units had to be reset so many times that it can no longer be reset: it feels like that internal pad you press on with a sharp pin has now disappeared and dont work anymore. I've only had this unit since NOVEMBER 17,2006 (it's now December 28,2006), so I no longer feel the reliability level of this product is sufficient to justify its purchase. Buy something else that works if you get this you are going to be mad."
1,"please do not waste your money ,DONT BUY A CREATIVE","as usual, it doesn't work with windows,please dont waste your money,i'm from mexico and my problem is worst because i cant get my money back,so you better try with another mp3 ,no CREATIVE."
3,MP3 User,"I've owned Ipods and several other mp3 players. This past Christmas, I received a Ipod Shuffle and one of these Zen mp3 players. The Shuffle does not have a screen but for the money it sure works a lot easier. Trying to work the Zen program to get the music on there was a pain in the keester."
1,poor mouse support,"Installed GCS1732 switch with one new HP pavillion p7-1010 usb mouse/keyboard windows 7 home premium and an older computer with XP service pack 3, MSI mainboard and intel 2.4 ghz processor and ps2 keyboard/mouse. The result is a mouse that works very irratic with both systems. I have had to unplug the usb mouse from the switch and plug a mouse seperatly into each computer. Iogear Technical support seems to be non existant."
5,Great KVM,"I have four different PC's that I use in the office. It is so nice to use only one keyboard/mouse for all four. The KVM was easy to set up and instructions were thorough. I like having the USB ports on the front for the keyboard/mouse console connection. The cables are heavy and feel well built. Switching between PC's is fast and the resolution is not bad at all. I am curious if this will support dual monitors. I am going to order a cable and will report back on that once I try it out. Overall, a great purchase. The packaging was thick, but the plastic was pre-cut around the box, so it made it easier to pull apart to get the KVM out."
1,"Doesn't work with nVidia, docking station, or Microsoft","Man, I wish I read the other reviews here before I bought this product. Sure enough, just like others have said, this does not work with nVidia motherboards. I spent many hours last night upgrading all my drivers and BIOS to no avail. The problem is the switch becomes confused and typing and mouse activity slow down to a crawl. Tech Support mentioned that a fix will be coming out in a month or two, but the guy I talked to didn't seem very informed to me.It also doesn't work with docking stations, such as the Dell D-Dock. The machine doesn't recognize it exists.Also, in IOGEAR's documentation they say that the switch may not work with keyboards and mice, such as the basic USB scroll mouse. Hmm.At this time don't waste your money. Check the IOGEAR support site to make sure a firmware upgrade is available and it addresses these issues. Once that happens I would be a happy customer."
1,Junk,I have owned this product for about a year. I hooked it up and the hot keys do not work. I put it away and then about a 9 months later tried it again and updated the firmware and it still does not work. I am using a Dynex multimedia keyboard and when you click the and feature other than my computer it bring up a context window. AVOID THIS DEVICE IT IS JUNK AND IOGEAR WILL NOT SUPPORT IT.
3,OK KVM,I am using this KVM with a Mac & a PC and my MS Intellimouse Optical USB is not recognized on the Mac side unless I plug it into the peripheral ports on the back of the KVM and NOT the mouse port on the front of the KVM. The PC side seems to recognize the mouse just fine.This is actually more inconvenient than it sounds since the KVM's rear USB ports are really designed to be used with printers and other peripherals that one wishes to share between the 2 computers and they can be switched seperately. Therefore if one wants to use the peripherals the mouse will also be switched over which is extremely inconvienient.Plus this KVM is not that inexpensive and I expect full functionality when spending this amount of $$s.
2,"Worked great for about 2 months, then didn't.....","I was quite please with this switch, when it first arrive. Easy to set up among 4 PCs. Woked extremely for the first 2 months, then it just wouldn't power on anymore. Just completly died. I even tried a different power supply. Should have lasted much longer. Will be looking to at a different brand."
2,Problems with mouse,Cables were included. I had problem with the mouse responsiveness horizontally on the screen. I could not find a setting to fix the problem. If I removed the switch box the mouse worked fine.
4,Good product,"The product was pretty easy to connect to both computers, and it's sleek design is great."
1,Do not buy this product until IOGEAR fixes it.,"In a nutshell, they have sold you an overpriced yacht (while neglecting to tell you there is a hole in the boat!) This KVM just doesn't work properly. It won't work with any keyboard except a $5 stripped down basic and it won't work with any mouse but a PS/2 wired 1 click mouse. Even with the standards it drops the devices. You need to reset the device several times in a day. This product is so faulty. For this reason stay way until the company releases new firmware to address all the engineering issues they have. Choose any othe KVM but this IOGEAR product."
2,Iogear needs to release firmware upgrade,"There are compatibility problems with this KVM, and Iogear seems unconcerned.I had to downgrade my Dell Dimension E510 BIOS from level A05 down to level A02 in order to get the GSC1734 to work."
5,A great product,"I purchased another leading brand KVM and it did not do the trick (it didn't work). This one works, no problems, easy setup, and unlike other KVMs it comes with all of the cables you will need, or at least for the connections to your keyboard, mouse, monitor, and some USB peripherals. I don't use the sound, but that is integrated also."
4,Satisfied,"I have used the IOGEAR GSC1734 for more than two years, and overall I'm satisfied. I use it to connect an HP xw4100 and a Thinkpad T30 connected via a docking station. I have occasionally experienced delays and unresponsiveness, and once or twice I've had to unplug a PS/2 keyboard. (I've used both a PS/2 and USB keyboard and mouse.) This KVM seemed to be the top choice when I purchased it. I am researching KVMs now to connect two computers for the kids, and expected to see a lot of great choices that include USB, audio and microphones; but they are still relatively pricey, and all seem to generate some complaints. So, I'll probably purchase another IOGEAR GSC1734."
2,HotKey Hell,"Works fine except... If you use hotkeys to switch between workstations (scroll lock twice) you must use the front console inputs. Also, the front console inputs dont work with my wireless keyboard/mouse combo."
1,RETURNING IT,"Tried setting it up and only one computer would work. Called into IOGear tech support and after 40 minutes of waiting I got a voicemail that just said ""Tech Support"" and beeped. Left a message, figured it might be lunch time? About 4 hours later I called again and after waiting about 25 minutes got a tech support person who told me to try re-connecting both computers again. WOW. So I did and again only one machine works. When I use the USB ports in the front for the KB and mouse it freezes constantly for 1-3 seconds. This is not a good product nor is the tech support worth the 40 minute hold time. REQUESTING A REFUND`"
1,Never ending grief,"I've had this product for 2 years, there has never been any FW updates. It will work for a bit, then mouse will mess up. buttons, scroll wheel, left and right button signals get mixed. Some times powering down all devices(pain) and unplugging the power to the kvm will fix it, but not always. Extended function for you mouse will not work so forget the joys of that. Support is as bad as it could get, if you have a weak heart just put it in the trash and save yourself."
1,Never buy an IOGEAR KVM switch,"I had a 2 port KVM switch from IOGEAR and it never worked with my IBM thinkpad from work. I did not pay much attention to it because I could work without the switch.When I added one more computer for photo storage and sharing, I needed a new KVM switch that has more than 2 ports. I bought one from IOGEAR and it did not work with my IBM thinkpad. This time I wanted to try something that works with my Thinkpad so I returned it got this one (GCS1734). It did not work either. I don't think the Thinkpads use nVidia chipsets. I paid about $180 for this silly hardware. Can you believe that just a switch costs $180 whereas you can get a computer (Negroponte's computer) for $150? Even Fry's sell a computer that is $200.This rip off still doesn't work. I don't know what the alternatives are. I do not want to spend more money and experiment with other KVM switches. Someone said Belkin KVM switches are a bit more expensive but does the job. I am not taking that chance right now."
3,A few OK poems without a clear audience,"I was looking for a book of poems that are fun to read and listen to. This isn't that book. The poetry isn't bad, but it's too complicated for children younger than about 6 and too boring for children older than about 7. There are wonderful poems that are fun to read and listen to. This collection doesn't have many of those. In fact, it doesn't have much poetry at all. This is not...[an inexpensive] book. It should be a nice fat book with hundreds of poems. It's not. I guess they spent all their money on color illustrations."
3,Noisy with Only Half the Sound,"I purchased this so my iPod can interface with the cassette deck in my car. It makes clicking noises while the tape is ""playing."" But that is not the worst of it. Sound only comes from the left speaker; no sound comes from the right. I am not sure what the problem is, because the speakers work just fine with the tuner and CD player, and the iPod works fine with other speaker systems. I suppose you get what you pay for."
1,DO NOT BUY,"The Hella HLA H1 24V 100W Halogen bulbs are the worst bulbs I have ever purchased. Absolutely no brightness to them and a waste of money. Please, DO NOT BUY"
2,Average plus sound quality,"Sound of low frequency component is somewhat blurred, making the sound focus less clear. Precise adjustment of resonance control in the box is needed and should be optimised. Design of the box looks modern and good, though. Bose system seems to be well-designed on excellent vibration analysis."
4,"Great sound, but an FM tuner would be nice","Other than the lack of an FM tuner--no complaints. Great sound, solidly built."
2,Lacks stereo spatial effect,"The loudspeakers are too close to each other, and since it's not possible to disassemble and move them around, the stereo spatial effect is almost completely lost in this device."
3,Overpriced!!,Well designed...great sound...but no controls on unit...what were they thinking?? control with remote with limited options...and the price....a killer! Wouldn't buy this if I really tried in a brick and morter store.
1,Phoooey,"This is one of the reasons why Ipod is getting on my nerves sometimes. Yeah Apple became famous due to the Ipod-hype. Ipod is cool alright, but hey, you add another product for it which is an obvious blatant abuse of marketing hype. This is first of all, WAY TOO EXPENSIVE, compared to the other equally good(or even better) hi-fi speakers out there. And second, the sound it produces is just freakin' the same. Sheeshhh... I don't know who would be able to spend their hard-earned money on this thing. Great speakers from Altec Lansing and Creative Labs are out there. They're equally good. This one? Well... it's a waste."
5,iPod Hi-FI,"It is the second speaker I have for apple, really its sound quality and its power are excellent. Whether you can buy one that does not hesitate, it's worth every dollar invested."
5,Great little speaker,"We bought this before a long travelling vacation, and it works great. The sound is much better than any portable device I've seen, period. Only regret has to do with the batteries - we bought rechargables (Rayovac Nickel Metal Hydride), and they only last about 4 hours, which means that you need several sets. It would have been great to have a built-in battery and better life, or at least a built-in battery charger so there wasn't so much changing of batteries. Also, the remote's usefulness is limited to volume, play/pause, and skip forward/back - no menu functions. We have the newest IPOD (v. 5.5, 80G), and I expected that the menu button on the remote would have some function, but it does not. All in all, I'd buy it again."
4,A great puzzler,"Let me just give you my opinon first, Mario Kart and F-Zero are better. The question is should you still buy it. The anwser to that is a maybe. If you have a GBA and need a good puzzler should you buy. The anwser to that is a yes. With a hole lot of puzzles this game should last you about a year. If you have friends this game is a blast to play. But be warned don't expect Mario Kart quality multiplay."
1,Please Don't Buy It,"THis game is a total disapointment. To save yourself money, simply don't by it. DOnt't listen to the other lieing reviews. Don't Buy Its boooooooriiinng!!"
3,Nice Chiller,"The Chiller is great and was delivered on time and met the description from the add. Would like to have had the oils and manufacturing grease removed. I knew I would have to sterlize it, but the manufacturer knows it is going to be used in beer making and just provides directions for removing the oils. Should be done before shipping."
4,"Very good, just not for me.",This product is great. It was however probably too small for my needs. I do 15.5 gallon batches to fill kegs and this is probably the right size for a 5-10 gallon. But it still works and is made well. Also the product came very quick without any problems.
3,Inlet and Outlet 180 Degrees Apart,"Good price and arrived in good condition, however the inlet and out let tubes are 180 apart - not as pictured."
5,Well made and does the job,"This chiller was well constructed with clean soldering. It cools the wort quickly, much faster than a 25' model I'd previously seen in action. The price was great on this too."
4,Gerald Browne knows the Gem Trade,"Precious stones have supported tyrants, funded revolutions, and inspired the dreams of explorers and the common man for millennia. While several of Browne's books focus on the diamond trade and the iron grip exercised over the global availability and exchange of those precious stones by the world's oldest and strongest cartel, this novel deals with emeralds. Rarer than diamonds, emeralds can cost more than diamonds. Mixed in with suspense and adventure is the message that diamonds are not the only ""blood"" gem marketed in the world and that people will go to any extreme to hold in their hand the key to a brighter future for themselves and the people they care about. If you enjoy reading about adventure in exotic places in a well written suspense novel that will leave you guessing until the last page, give this one a try."
5,"Yogi Tea - Slim Life Green Tea, 16 bags","This is great tea for balanced weight loss.as it does not deplete our body unnecessarily. It has some herbs to take care of body energy.As it has some Trifla which balance our three doshas(vata,pita,kapha)according to ayurvedic theory."
1,Go for the Gerber Set instead,"I agree with the reviewer who said to get the Gerber Bare Basics set instead of this. I had planned to buy this set for a friend because she had it on her registry, then when I got to the store and saw the Gerber set I found it was much better. You get better quality products, larger sizes, a sturdier plastic case and a nice CD of music. It's well worth the extra $10."
2,too harsh,"i love the lavendar sleepytime smell, but too harsh for babys skin, especially excema. go with aquaphor baby wash"
5,Hey There! What's this??,"Hey There! I just recieced this little card. Very thin and you wouldn't believe the size. its just amazing on how 128 (Actually its about 124 MB after the 64KB blocks used for each MB for memory manegment) MB fits on just a small card. However I use it for my Mp3 player. (Nomad 2c Creative Labs see my review) The card works great with the player. however, it is a bit slower but a reader from Viking can fix the problem if you are really that mean about speed. Its great though. Its worth the (dollar amount). (Im mad that I bought the card later and I lost (dollar amount) because I couldn't wait.)"
5,perfect for digital cameras,"this was the perfect sized card for my 2MP camera. I definately recommend getting a bigger card rather than a smaller - you'll wish you had it when you run out of room. I would even go up from this, but so far I haven't taken enough pictures to warrant a bigger one."
5,Terrific!!,I am a new digital camera owner and was very leary of ordering this for my Olympus 550 Zoom camera. It was so much cheaper than the Olympus card and it works terrific. I'm going to order another since I do International trips and take lots of pictures.
5,As Good A Card As Any I've Used,"This makes my fourth 128MB SmartMedia card. I use them with my Olympus C-4000 digital camera. Actually, I can't really have too many of these and hope to buy more of them before they become scarce (because they may you know). I have never had an issue with the SmartMedia card format. Anyway, this particular card is a good one."
5,"A great product, but a sleazy rebate","Amazed that Amazon.com would offer a rebate that says 15 days to return rebate information and then not even ship the card and it's been 15 days since I ordered it. My girlfriend got hers today, exactly 15 days after she ordered it (too late to get to the post office). First disappointing purchase experience with Amazon.com. It's a shame given what a otherwise great company they are. I just cancelled my order out of my frustration. My girlfriend is probably going to return her card. Don't offer the rebate if you can't fulfill it! It's pulling people into a purchase that they may not have otherwise bought and then not honoring the rebate offer.The card is great, by the way. No problem, ever, after 6 months of ownership."
5,Quality and Price,"When shopping for additional memory for my Olympus digital camera I had two considerations, quality and price. In this instance Viking was a brand name with a good reputation for quality and between Amazon.com's discount and Viking's rebate the price was within a buck or two of the lowest anywhere for any brand of 128MB SmartMedia cards. This made buying it an easy decision.In the camera it works flawlessly. As a novice digital photographer I'm still in awe of the freedom having a big memory card gives me to shoot 256 high-res pictures without changing ""film""."
2,burnt out on me,"I have the 64 meg card. It is either in my reader or my camera. Last time I d/l photos it kept telling me I needed to reformat the disk (can you even do that??) but I eventually got the photos off. This morning the same thing happened... and I can not get the pictures off. :( I can see them fine in the camera, but can't find my cord that came with the camera. So do I see if I can get a new card or go buy a new reader?? To say the least had I been on vacation I would have been extremely ticked off."
3,It's only good until you formatted it,"Well, the bad thing is after your camera with this 128MB card has errors, then you format it. The problem is really big: the speed is VERY slow after you formatted it. YOu can only ship it back to VIKING to have them fix it for you."
5,Works great,"Been using the card for about 3 years now, has about outlived its usefulness because of size, but is still working good after hundreds of downloads/erases."
4,Good Value,"SmartMedia is now outdated having been replaced by newer memory formats. However, I have an old camera that I leave at work and this works great. Instead of using a serial cable to download I just pull the card and use a card reader. Now my old camera effectively uses USB 2.0 and with this 128 MB card I'm way ahead of the 8 MB card that originally came with the camera. I figured I couldn't pass up getting one of these before they are completely phased out and no longer available."
5,Works PERFECTLY in Olympus D-510 - 90 pics in SHQ!,"Just got the 128Mb for my Olympus D-510. Works great - here are the number of pics:* HQ - 257 pics (10 rolls of film worth for vacation)* SHQ - 90 pics (4 rolls of film - WOW!)I just snap away! Love this card. Please note - panoramas do not work on this card - Olympus put special ""instructions"" on their cards for this. Doesn't matter - when (if ever) I need a panorama shot I will use the 8mb card that came with the camera"
5,Go with the good stuff,"You can find cheaper cards out there. But this is a quality piece of merchandise that you can count on to store those important picture on. Formats easily, provides high quality pictures."
2,Card is fine. Rebate program is the worst!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Watch out for Viking's rebate programs! Bought one of these cards last year and it took over 8 months and 10 phone calls to finally get my rebate. First, they claimed that my submission had been lost, then it was mysteriously received, then it took 4 months to cut the check, and finally about 4 weeks just to have the check mailed. I pursued it this long just on the principle of the thing.Card works just like all of the other brands I have which is to say just fine."
4,128 Smart Media Card,"The Viking 128 mb smart media card permits me to take approximately 175 pictures of very high quality before having to download them from my digital camera to the computer. After some months experience, I can report the card works perfectly. Its only weakness - but not significant to me as I also have a smaller capacity Olympus card - is that it will not allow ""panorama"" pictures with my Olympus. To do that - namely, stitching separate pictures - takes a proprietary card. However, for all other purposes, this Viking card is a very fine product."
3,Forest,"it's okay for the price but don't get this one in addition to another of her books. It has the same , but less of it. Not a whole lot to the book."
5,007 Rocks!!,"overall an excellent game. music includes the bond theme and other tunes that will have you moonwalking. good selection of weapons and the save feature is cool too. good story and game play also. the game has people that you'll probobly recognize from bond films. examples: odd job, jaws, general golgov, M, Q, and Moneypenny. one of the best games i've ever played. I recomend this game to everyone."
5,Cool!,"I bought this game, and I thought it was great. IT is very good.If you are a big fan of James Bond, you will recongize many people such as Moneypenny, M, and even Q! It doesn't so much rely on stratagy, but more like puzzle solving and complicated riddles. It also features the classic Bond theme song."
4,Excellent replacement part,This part is kind of hard to find. The replacement part fits very well and the price is low. You can use it to mount a modern radio in this aging car model.
1,Fit was a little off on my 91,The fit was a little off and I needed to shave a portion of the bezel to get it to fit
5,Great for Home Office Users!!,"I have used this product for two years and it is GREAT! I am no accountant, but using the simple ""interview"" style questioning, I was able to ensure I got all the deductions I had coming! It helps me make sure I get every advantage possible from my home office, my business vehicle, espenses, etc., and makes it easy! You merely walk through the process, step by step, and TurboTax keeps checking and double checking your answers as you go to keep errors from occurring. Not sure what any of the questions mean? Their excellent help feature gives you all the infomration you need in plaing English--not ""legalese"" or IRS jarghon.Want to save tax dollars without paying big bucks to an accountant? BUY THIS!!"
2,Squadrons Up!,"This book turned out to be written by a war correspondent. It was not too bad, but did not describe the action of WW2 as a pilot would have."
4,Gilb writes about what's real,"Mr. Gilb writes about those stories whose characters are three dimensional. The stories are atypical in that they don't always end up as you would have liked, but nevertheless capture the essence of the environment. Sometimes we picture a story with characters that has a happy ending, but life is not always kind and Dagoberto does a masterful job in drawing you into the story. I wouldn't say I enjoyed all his stories, but nevertheless enjoyed the theme of the working man in ways I would have never experienced myself.His Latino focused stories involve characters that transcend the Latino culture that when you strip the location, the language, or the culture, you find a person (regardless of culture) who finds himself struggling through a working life on a day to day basis."
3,Average Stories by Rude Writer,"The stories in this collection are okay -- glimpes into the lives of working-class Mexican-Americans -- but are nothing more than okay. I have met Mr. Gilb, and he is a damn rude human being."
5,Magical Work,"Sometimes you come across a book that can change the way you see things. I am not a Latino or from the Southwest, but I come from a family of construction workers. This is the first book that I have ever read that touches that world with honesty, humor, and pathos. The stories make humans out of characters, people usually not given a voice. Gilb makes every ordinary event resonate with mystery. He is a writer of great beauty, even as the language is coarse. Several of his stories are among the best I've ever read. He may be the most original of Latino writers publishing, and his stories are better than most of the well-known, anthologized American ones."
5,Magical and REal,"Dagoberto Gilb has a magical style. The stories in Magic of Blood are some of the best I've read by a current Latino author. They capture reality. This is a collection of stories that did take me a long time to read, but it is worth every minute."
3,nice frist Cd,I think this is a nice frist cd. The songs on it are nice. But I think it is not that powerfull which is why I give it 3 stars. I like the wlech songs alot they are very nice to hear.
3,Good Start,"This was Katherine Jenkins frist CD .Frist off I would have to start off by saying that Katherine has a very nice voice,But I think some of the song's on this CD can be boring but I still enjoy the CD."
4,Classical Music,I like it It sounds great It is about what I expected Wnen your are satisfied and you enjoy all the other Rhetoric is unnecessary. Dont sweat the spelling.
5,Katherine Jenkins,"Katherine Jenkins sings like an angel, & realy touches the soul I think you will be very impressed no amazed by the power of her voice."
4,Score: 13/14,"My wife and I enjoyed this recording - the lady sings beautifully. (And on the album cover she looks like a pretty schoolteacher before all the glamour/sequins/ballgown stuff of all the later albums - I suppose there's no going back...?)However as an album, it is ruined by the ridiculous rendition of Cwm Rhondda (track 14) which is over-produced with a stupid orchestral arrangement more suited to ""Star Wars"" or somesuch, that while clearly intended as a climax to the collection, is excruciating - a literal ""turn off""!Hence 13/14 :-("
4,4 stars,it was great quy to go good good and many thanks for a team effortt katherine jenkins premire pkgs was good
4,Fun game,"This game made good use of SNES' graphic ability, making this game fun and enjoyable, with a rich variety of levels to explore. This is your basic side-scrolling game, as Donkey Kong has to make his way through levels and defeat baddies. The levels are varied enough to not be repetitive, and this is an overall decent game for the SNES."
5,BEST GAME!,"This game rocks!Play as Donkey Kong and Diddie Kong!Help them battle the evil King K.Rool!TRUST ME,BUY THIS NOW! A GREAT,FUN,AND GOOD GAME!"
5,It's all been said,"What else can i say about this 16 bit CLASSIC? It always reminds me of great Christmas memories as Nintendo always seemed to release the 3 SNES DKC games near winter. And these games being my main gift was always a definite treat. I was so hyped up for DKC after the Nintendo Power VHS I received in the mail. I can still remember playing it and being BLOWN sway!! To this day, a CLASSIC! The graphics, music, & gameplay still blow my mind. Still hoping for that proper sequel. DKCReturns for Wii is cool...but i'd LOVE a real sequel to DKC3"
4,#1 SNES Game Ever!,"#1 best, hit me if ya disagree. Love the mine ride origional!""Fun? 5* = because of all of the fun.Overall? 4* = cuz of all of the fun, the greatness, and dot dot dot...the only reason that it was 4 not 5 is the graphics were not in 'the upper echelon of the best usage of the system' (like donkey kong country 2 and 3 but with better game but worse graphics usage).Killer-killer game, y'alls."
3,Donkey KOng Country,"The game was just what we were looking for. Label was torn a bit and the game itself was a little dirty, but cleaned up well. It was delivered in a timely matter. Thank you!S. Bell"
3,Interesting attempt at a 3D game.,"When reading the box and manual, they keep pushing the idea of a 3D game. The characters are more or less in 3 dimensions, as well as items in the game. The background moves at a different speed than the pathways adding to the illusion.The game is fun, challenging, and entertaining. Though there is a lack of points to be earned, killing all the enemies gain you nothing but the pleasure of the ""bong"" sound. Extra lives are in the form of balloons and collecting 100 bananas. The ability to switch between Donky(heavy attacks) and Diddy(high jumps) on the fly adds to level complexity. If you can find them you can ride an ostrich, rhino, or a swordfish that help with their special abilities."
1,Doesn't Work,"I ordered this game because i loved this game when i was a kid, and i was really happy when i found it for this price. When i recieved the game in the mail I felt like a kid again. I ran straight to my super nintendo and put it in. It started just fine, nut then it would even play. I cleaned it up a bit till it started to play. I played for about an hour and saved it. The next day I tried to load my last save. MY GAME WASN'T SAVED. The game I got has a big problem not sure what it is but I am not very happy about it. Oh and FYI it came all scratched up and the title sticker was colored on. This game was said to be in good condition. This guy needs glasses. SAVE YOUR MONEY. Buy from someone else."
3,They say hindsight is 20/20...This game wasn't as great as I remembered.,"What's sad is that this game seemed like a huge achievement back in '94. Maybe I was too young to realize it back then. Maybe it was lack of experience. I thought this game rocked when it first came out, and unfortunately I'm no longer sure why.To me, it seems this is a fairly average platformer wrapped up in a beautiful package. The graphics were novel and unique at the time, but I guess now I just think they're awkward and weird looking. My main beef with the game is the control and the frustrating level design. The mine cart stages and the ones where you have to fire yourself from barrel to barrel...somehow I beat this when I was 6. I can't fathom how I did that now.Another minor problem is that the bosses are all pretty easy. Four hits usually does the trick.I don't recommend re-playing this oldie. Unlike Sonic and Mario World, this one may be better left as a childhood memory."
1,Tisk tisk...,"I don't know what happened to Useless ID between the release of Bad Story Happy Ending and this abomination, but whatever it was it wasn't good.The pride of Hafia Israel, Useless ID, used to be a good punk band with poppy components. With this cd, it's obvious that they've become a pop band with (presumably) punk hair cuts. If you liked Let it Burn or Bad Story Happy Ending, do not buy this cd."
5,Best Metroid Game EVER!!,"This game is 100% I love it. It's so cool, you get to go and fight aliens and stuff. I love the Metroid games but this is number one. Youv'e gotta beat this weird thing called Mother Brain, and if You beat the game in under 3 hours you get to see Samus in a Bikini. My favorite items are the Super Missles and the Power Bombs. If you don't have this game and you have a SNES, GET THIS!! In this Metroid game you are a girl Samus because the boy died in Metroid 2 return of Samus. The hardest boss is Ridley, even if you beat Mother Brain you still have to beat Ridley again. Overall, this is a exellent game and only gamers who like challenges, Puzzles and really hard stuff that requires full Brain Power should take on the excitement of this game!!!"
3,"Awesome game, horrible story execution...","No matter whether or not you liked the original NES Metroid, you're probably gonna be amazed by this game. Taking a lot of elements from the original and adding others, this game is easily a million times better than the NES version. Samus' animations are silky-smooth, and her weapons are lethal. The only bad part? The story isn't really tied into the actual gameplay, forcing you to blindly proceed through the game. Grab a power-up somewhere, backtrack to sometimes 5 or more areas you've already been to, and use the power-up in hopes that it'll effect your progress somehow? That isn't gameplay. That's horrible! I've beaten the game, and I'll probably never go through the entire thing again."
1,This is pathetic!,"So the other day I was strolling around the mall, cool as usual. When I came across this place that was sellingold video games. I figured ""hey why not, I'll check this out"". So this guy there starts giving me crap about buyinga game, he said that I didn't have enough money. There was just no way I was paying $5 for a game this old! Talkabout a pain in the face, so I obtained the game by other methods. I bought it off Amazon.com for $24 which wasa pretty good deal I thought. The game is pretty awesome too. I'm playing it right now!!!"
5,I told ya not to go there!,"3D is good and so is 2D, people should not display ignorance in themselves by saying simply because humans mastered one artform prior to another, the prior is inferior. 2D is not inferior because that is the same as saying blue is more primitive than red. It makes no sense. They are both rendered differently and express game content differently. Besides, it is not as if 3D is really 3D anyways since you use a flat 2D TV screen to view the fake 3D environment. If you could pass your hand through the TV into the environment it would be 3D.So in conclusion, 2D is valid and ""3D"" is valid as plausible TV game options. Don't make yourself look immature by disputing irrelevant information."
5,One of the best games ever!,"A great child hood game, but recently started playing again and man its fun. I still remember some of where the hidden items are. Well worth the money! BUY IT"
5,Great,Not as good as the original on the NES but Metroid is still awesome just the same. Love the older games.
5,Super Metroid,"One of my favorites, aside from the Zelda games, and the Illusions of Gaia...Super Metroid is one of those games that I can just play for hours, and not think about anything...I still have yet to go back and get the items that was missing when I finished the game, but obviously they were not needed...This is a challenging game that anyone can enjoy, if they have the time. My grandmother enjoyed this one, but kept calling me for hints on what she had to do next. The challenge, to me, is the part that is most enjoyable...If you are looking for a game that will take a few hours of your life, this is a good choice!"
5,My Favorite Game!,"I aboslutely love this game! It's the coolest. The graphics are great and the weaponry and enemies are extremely realistic, without there being any violence. The music intertwines with the areas very well too. All in all, this game is extremely entertaining, challenging, and a must-have for any player of the Super NES."
5,Pefect Game.,"Super Metroid is one of the best Nintendo Games I have played. It's as fun and exiting watching someone play it as it is playing by yourself. Although it get's easy to beat after a few times, you can see different endings according to how long it takes you to beat it.Graphics: 2 thumbs up.Story:Great story compared to some games I know.(I not saying the story line is bad or anything, but it can be better). I say: great game.Nintendo should make a gamboy advance game for it."
4,Scary music+Dark background= fun? I guess so.,I can't get past the Brinstar for beans but let me say that this is a descent game. It is extremely challenging even with a players guide but yet is so fulfilling. It really shows what happens when jellyfish go bad. This is an innovative side-scrolling shooter that keeps you happy though I could do without the creepy music. The original Metroid had more catchy and exciting tunes. There's the only flaw besides the extreme difficulty.
4,"Really tight game for super NES, could use a little work","Super Metroid is absolutely one of the best games ever made for Super Nintendo. The graphics are astounding on the system for a side to side motion game, and has many different moves and weapons, with very little violence,which makes it suitable for younger kids.The controls are great, but it's quite hard to bounce off walls and accend higher, and unlike Metroid Fusion on GBA there are no directions what so ever to tell you where to go, so it took me a while to find my way around in the game. But there is no doubt that this is an excellent game, but I suggest purchasing it at a local game store."
5,The Best Metroid Ever!,"I was never that happy with my experience with the 3D Metriods as they felt to confining,and not deep.Although I haven't played Corruption yet.But Super Metriod is the game that got me reinvigorated about the series.Its just fantastic with plenty of puzzles,great Super Nintendo graphics and great controls.You can actually wall jump.The powerups,upgrades and special abilities you can acquire,as you go,are always rewarding to find.Altogether the game is simply a quintessential platformer style shooter with timeless and addictive gameplay.Buy it!"
2,Good potential--too way out there.,"First off, the author has some talent. His descriptions and use of vocabulary are pretty good. On the negative side, there are some scenes and plot movements that don't make any sense. The whole, pick up the Nazi SS officers off the submarine and then have them appear at meetings in full Nazi uniform in Washington D.C. was way too over the top. Also, I found it hard to believe that the protagonist was so brilliant at tracking down the villain, yet could not find the time to let his superiors in on his pursuit strategy. The showing up at a bond rally in Washington D.C. with a Tommy gun under your coat also left me rolling my eyes. Bottom line--don't expect this book to be made into a movie, it ain't that good."
1,P.O.S.,"Have been using this for a couple of days now and sorely disappointed. If you move the compass (of your own choice or it falls off the windshield), you need to recalibrate it. I've been sitting at stop lights and seen a 10 swing of direction. I have no intention of keeping this because of its lack of user friendliness."
1,Undependable and short life!,I have owned three of these compasses and none have lasted longer than three months. Does not work well in urban areas when it is working. If there are any power lines near you it will not work either. I would not reccomend this product to any one.
1,Totally disappointed 0 stars,I order this product for myself and one for my parents. Neither of them would even turn on. When I contacted the seller. Deals of today they said I would have to go to the manufacturer to return. I contacted the manufacturer and they have not handled this item for 3 years and had turned it over to another company. That company CT Global said since I bought it from a non authorized dealer they couldn't help me either. I have yet to hear back from Ebuyyxp to find out what to do. I think Amazon needs to be more careful whom they allow to sell stuff through them.
2,Cheap,"Item mounting screws stripped as I was trying to install. Had to glue the mounting bracket. Cheap product, definatly wouldnt reccomend."
1,Dead on Arrival,"I should have heeded the bad reviews on this site.I purchased this as a Christmas gift and tried to set it up for the recipient. It was dead on arrival.I tried a new battery, still dead on arrival. Both batteries tested OK, clearly it's a dead unit.I contacted the new manufacturer (NOT PNI as advertised) and am awaiting a response.I can't recommend this product."
2,You get what you pay for,I will not recommend this product. I use it in my car and most of the time is wrong. If you really need a compass you better read all reviews. I usually do it but I couldn't find about this product and well ... lucky it was only a few dollars.
2,it worked for 3 month,"I bought it from sears, it worked for 3 month, then stoped, no screen display, changed with new battery, still not working. I gave up."
1,I'd rate it '0' if there was a choice,"I bought this unit two months ago and since that time I have used it sparingly. I went to turn it on today and it was dead. So I went out and bought a new battery and replaced the old one. Still dead. I tested the battery on a meter and it was full of juice, unlike this so called 'rugged' unit. A total waste of money, be forwarned!"
4,Good quality for a reasonable price,"This watch is an excellent value. It's perfectly crafted, a sturdy design with an accurate movement (spec says -4/+6 sec per day). I personally prefer leather straps, so I will remove the bracelet and put on a black croc instead. Order on Amazon went trough smoothly. The price is very reasonable (apx. $1800) and a lot of watches - with a much bigger price tag - use exactly the same movement ETA 2892-A2 (the actual 'gears' in the watch) all tough in higher 'finish grade' (more polished gears - but who cares). It is also a ""true"" GMT watch, meaning you can adjust the second time zone in 1-hour steps without changing the normal hour hand, which is not common in this price range.The only thing I don't like is the Manual. It's bad enough that there are 10 languages in the booklet, but they explain a lot of different watches (a dozen calibers or so) in one single manual. That sucks."
2,Beware Ordering This Item,"The watch I am sure is fantastic; however, I ordered it and selected next day shipping. The next day after I saw it had not yet processed, I was told I needed to submit the order once more--some sort of technical glitch on their end. I did as instructed and the next day I saw it had not been processed! After many phonecals, I was told the item was not available from amazon.com. The number listed as being available has not changed from the website since that time. Ultimately, I did purchase the white-bezel version of this watch (2538.20) and absolutely love it! You are getting a quality watch at a good price (with serial numbers intact), but the process in actually getting product is difficult--I had to call twice on my second order after it sat for two days!! Overall, I would buy again from amazon.com, but it requires an assertive purchaser to make it work."
3,Pretty strange and light for erotica ...,"The author Ray Gordon always seems to surprise this reader ... I never ever know what I'm gonna get .... an erotic masterpiece, a soso piece of drivel, or, a 'oh my god i cant believe i bought this book' ....OK this one is a drivel ranked story. The book deals with a young Sally, that happens on an abandoned house that is full of some of the most supernaturally perverted ghosts in creation. She ends up with a series of encounters with plumbers, real estate agens, bankers etc etc that once they get into the house, go absolutely nuts , and start dowing the down and ditry with whoever is around ...Needless to say they all seem to 'stagger' out of the house with little memories of what happened. Sorry the story just isn't there ...."
5,Edward Costello of the Light Division,This is an authentic account of Edward Costello's life in the Duke of Wellington's light infantry. It is a first hand account of Costello's duty as an enlisted soldier with the Light Division in the Peninsular War and later the Battle of Waterloo. It is one of the few memoirs that are worth reading from that era. It includes his experience storming Ciudad Rodriguez as a member of the forlorn hope and a engaging in a bit of plundering at Vittoria. A good read!
4,Home Run,"I've been listening to Jason and his band for a couple of years now and one thing is for sure,they don't disappoint. This newest CD ""The Jason Martinko Revue"" hits on all cylinders. After listening to this CD, its apparent that their influences and roots reflect just about all types of music for the listener's pleasure. The band is very tight and Jason's vocals set the tone for good story telling or just flat out rock n' roll. They don't seem to have any restrictions as they play such a wide variety of musical genre. If you're looking for someone new to listen to, check out ""The Jason Martinko Revue""...Keep it rocking!"
4,Hot Upcoming Stars,"The whole album is a refreshing breath proving that rock is not dead! Each song is a totally new experience; no two songs on the album can be classified in the exact same way. The Jason Martinko Revue can not be classified, or better yet, they will not be pigeoned toed. There are old blues tracks, as well as 50's bee-boop, 60's funk, and modern day rock. Some songs have elements of all of the above. I think they may be generating a whole new radio station with this one album. I recommend that everyone purchase this album, so they can enjoy the new face of music to come.... I cannot wait for the next release from these guys!"
3,AJ is displeased with this games graphics,This game is a little bad. The tuskin raiders look like skeletons in clothes and the asteriod level is so easy that you can watch t.v. while doing it. And the characters you play do not like the stars in the movie. I think return of the jedi is better than this.
1,This game blows and isn't fun to play!,"This game blows and isn't fun to play! It also has really bad graphics. I wasted money on this game, but you shouldn't."
2,Blade Armor?! Hah!,"The tape has excellent standout but for the most part it is not extremely useful. I've used a ton of Stanley tape measures and it seems breaking within the first couple of inches is what usually makes me have to trash them. The irony of my experience with the ""Xtreme"" is that it broke in a few months right there in the blade armor. Since you have to practically take out a mortgage to buy one of the longer tapes in the ""Xtreme"" line I don't think I'll ever be using one of these again. These seem substantially heavier & bulkier than equivalent length tapes as well"
5,xtremely durable,This tape is amazing. This is the first tape that I have ever worn the paint off of . I had to retire it after two years of hard use in the electrical trade. I have never had a tape last this long
4,Interesting bits of Family History,"My interest in the book was my husband's family history, and found quite a few bits on his family and those they married. However, there were very interesting bits about unrelated people that drew me in. Readable."
5,Taking the fifth,"As usual, Janice delivers. This read is as good as her other novels. I hope she keeps writing. Thanx for an enjoyable evening."
4,Author writes well,Jance is a good writer and carries the story along well.Her characters are comfortable in the plot which is well crafted.
5,TAKING THE FIFTH-JANCE,THE BOOK CAME IN GREAT CONDITION AND I AM SURE I WILL REALLY ENJOY IT. I LOVE THE AUTHOR AND HER WRITING. THANKS SO MUCH. JANICE
3,just ok,i was excited to read this based on the great reviews but ended up quite disappointed. i found it boring and i even skimmed the end just to get through it.
2,JUST OKAY,"These are alright. I prefer other brands. They absorb but in a strange almost clumpy manner. I won't be buying them again, because my chihuahua uses them, but tears them up. It may have to do with the scent on them."
2,pee pee pads,really a waste of $27. put one out our yorkie sniffed it and walked away. came back in the room a few minutes later and dog had ripped the pad to shreds into a pile and left a large turd next to pad. huh!
3,Cool colors but page too narrow...,These dividers are nice colors but they won't work if you use sheet protectors- they are too narrow and you won't see the dividers stick out from the pages.
1,Not durable,"After a month of use, these dividers are ripped and falling apart so I've had to replace the ones I bought for my daughter. The plastic is very thin and tears easily."
5,Exactly what you would expect,I was satisfied with the quality of this product. I is exactly what you would expect if you purchased from a brand name supplier...only much cheaper.
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed that these divider inserts were posted as a recommendation on the same page as the coupon pages that I ordered, but they are not as wide; therefore, my divider tabs do not stick out farther than the coupon pages. It is difficult to find the section I am looking for without paging through the entire binder."
3,not any pouch,this is super good but the problem with it is that there is no pouch thing to put your papers for a binder you have to open the rings and put them between the deviders there is no pouch. so they are ok but not the best
2,Rips too easily.,I already ripped a few of them after a few-day use in a 2-inch binder with ~400 sheets. I won't be buying any more of these.
3,"Good product,only...the price was high","a bit over-priced for what you get. Other than that, it did the job and even the site they direct you to to print out tabs worked well."
5,Luv These !,"I have always purchased these to protect my important documents ... Works like a charm. Also use for court documents and keep in binders, keeps me organized !"
3,"Powerpuff Girls rock, but I'm not so sure about this...","This book is #4 i the series of POwerpuff Girls books. Naturally, I bought the book because I'm collecting the series. But if that's not your case, take my advice--DON'T LOOK FORWARD TO SOMETHING SPECTACULAR. YOU'LL JUST GET DISAPPOINTED. And it's true. So, if you just got you allowance and decided to spend it on this, I suggest-NO. Well, I'm not your mother, so do what you want. I just think that this book is A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT."
1,Inferior Product,"I've tried using Rhinotek ink for several printers I've had, and they never seem to be as good as the Epson ink. I find they clog and/or run out of ink faster than the Epson, so I never really trust them."
5,AN AWSOM GAME ONE OF THE BEST EVER FUN EASY BUT CHALLENGING,this is a good game for a beginer game player or just someone looking for a good game the levels are sometimes easy and sometimes hard it's just as good as the SNES version an awsom game worth any player
2,Famous Americans in really bad italian movies,"I remember seeing the Ursula Andress pictorial of this movie in Playboy back in the 70s and thought it would be a hot movie........well some 40 years later I found it here and bought it and live to regret it, really a bad movie....Ursula Andress undressed for about 5 seconds."
3,A good book!,"This book is good. Maddy, Kam, Jesse,and Nicholas are great characters. Lauraine had done it again! Keep it up Lauraine!"
5,Excelent way to save space an preserve DVDs,"I've missed this product at several stores. It's the right size, and very convenient way to preserve our DVDs and all the original boxes were recycled!"
1,Misleading picture,I bought this online because the picture shows the case to be a 3 ring binder type. Which it is not. It has 2 wide flat things that slide out from the front of the binder. You must take all and any sleeves out if you want to get one in the back. If you don't care to pop one out to take on the go (instead of taking the whole case) then its fine. But that does not work well for me. I am very disappointed in the picture shown and the product I recieved.
2,"Poorly executed, a bit hard to follow","This book was not well edited. I was amazed that a man with Brimacombe's credentials had such poor grammar. Also, refers to one of the ""Queen's Men"" as Anthony on one page and Arthur the next. How did the editor miss that? Brimacombe's skipping around would be a little difficult to follow for someone with no previous knowledge of Elizabeth I. The only reason I did not discontinue reading this book was that there were enough new tidbits here and there to keep me interested, however, for one new to the subject, there are many better books out there."
5,"Karsh effectively challenges ""New"" Historians","In this work, Karsh presents a credible academic refutation to the scholars who call themselves the ""New Historians"". Karsh carefully documents their errors and omissions of which there are many, and effectively demolishes their arguments. Highly recommended!"
4,Lean for the office,Very handy reference book - nice production but some of the graphics could have been more professional looking. But the big thing is that I got several good learning points from the book and it is well worth the money.
3,"Good overview, nothing special","I am always looking for pocket guides to give to clients. This won't be one of those. I can't fault the basic content, but it just leaves me looking for something more. There are quite a few pages at the end with forms."
5,Not For Amateurs,"If you're not passionate about cooking, you won't appreciate the performance of this cookware. The pans heat evenly and consistently, which you won't notice unless you cook A LOT. They're also heavy and not always easy to clean. I bought mine a piece at a time at TJ Max, Marshall's, and the Williams Sonoma outlet mall. They're worth the money and the weight."
2,Maybe I got a bad pair.,"I love Thorlos. I probably have 10 pairs. This is my first pair of the tennis socks however. Within 2 or 3 wearings one of the socks developed a hole (high up on the ankle) and a thread came loose from the top. I'll probably try another pair to make sure I didn't just get a lemon. They feel very comfortable otherwise.Update: October 2007. I bought a second pair. So far so good. I am still not sure they are worth the money, but at least this pair hasn't started to unravel."
4,well...I am glad that I kept reading this series,"The first book got 3 stars, the second one 3.5 and this one 4. At least Ms. Michaels is improving with each book. :-)I thought that it would be hard to beat Morgan as a heroine (she was just so lovable and different than most historical romance women) but somehow the reserved Eleanor became just as endearing of a character as her more rambunctious sister. The chemistry between her and Jack was great and the plot line was much better than the previous books (this one seemed to have a point). And, finally, the island plot introduced in the 1st book and almost ignored in the 2nd comes to light. The villians are almost amusing and the brief family appearances are encouraging. After forcing myself to continue the series, I am actually looking forward to the next book. If Ms. Michaels continues to improve at this rate, she may yet get a 5 star rating out of me."
3,Virtuous women,"Actully, in Kasey Michael's world no woman is strictly virtuous - they all are tempted by absolute stunners of men and usually act on that attraction, regardless of the public mores of the day. The Beckets of Romney Marsh are particularly drawn to this view. But who would read the books otherwise!?Eleanor Becket is the eldest 'daughter' of the Becket family, who has been in love with Jack Eastwood, a smuggler friend of the Beckets, for ages and leaps (in spite of her bad ankle) to aid Jack in some conspiracies going on in London. In short order they become involved, Eleanor's unknown father, a terrible villain, turns up and much mayhem takes place. An enjoyable read.Linda Sheean"
4,wonderfully illustrated,"The beauty of this book is in the brightly colored llustrations. Every page sports a bright red background with equally bright pictures. The story is about a family of five that goes out for a dim sum meal -- each person chooses what he or she likes. The pictures depict a real-looking family eating in real family fashion -- one child reaching in front of one another to grab an egg tart, one child sticking chopsticks in her mouth like walrus tusks. After the meal, the children all look sleepy and contented as Dad reaches for the bill.The text of the book isn't particularly catchy; it is very simple and it refers to the dim sum without using any Chinese words."
1,Worst book I read in a long time,"Avoid this book. The plot was simple and stupid; the characters were shallow and unlikable; and there was absolutely no science or clever age reversal process (just plastic surgery and an do-it-all wonder drug with no more detail to it). If I were in the baby boomer age bracket I would be insulted by its generalizations of materialism, shallowness, irresponsibility and desperate desire to be 20 again. As an X-gen, I was insulted by its disingenuous, narrow stereotypes of people in their 20s and early 30s. There was no redeeming qualities of human nature, feelings... anything. What a waste of time. I finished this book only because I had nothing else to do on the airplane ride. I should have done nothing instead."
1,WISH I COULD REVIEW THIS,Well although this isn't directly related to the actual product one should know that the manufacturer of this product is no good. I ordered this from amazon 2 weeks ago and haven't heard or gotten anything except an email from amazon stating they can't get a hold of them to confirm shipping. How horrible can customer service be?I looked forward to getting this bag but I guess that's not going to happen. Good luck and hopefully this won't happen to you.
3,Tetris II review,The game came in great condition. The system does not have any trouble playing the game. The game was delivered within the time stated. Thank you!
5,Finally!,"A wonderfully eclectic mix of punk, pop, and metal. Mind-bending lyrics interact in an incredible melange resulting as each instrument takes turns at being in the forefront and then blends with the rest in a style that is 100 percent their own.I'd heard about their music about 3 years ago but never got to experience it for myself. I must say it was worth the wait!!"
4,good product,Good product. Does not require putting any holes in the wall. Stays up well. Easy to twist to the correct size for your window.
2,Hardly about Hunting Alaska,"While the author makes an honest effort to explain certain aspects of hunting in Alaska, he also includes several chapters/stories about his personal hunts. While they are interesting, they do little to prepare you for the hunt. I was looking more for specific information about where to hunt the different species and specific clothing and equipment guides. I had recently purchased Hunting Sheep in Alaska by Tony Russ. His book goes into much greater detail about dall sheep and helps to explain the different geographical areas of Alaska, what to expect for terrain, trophy size, weather, etc. I strongly recommend Tony's book over this one."
2,Needs more detail,"This book is okay, but would have been MUCH more useful had the writer included more specifics. Sure, you need to take psychology courses, but which courses are most useful??? It's well written, but more of an overview, which (for me) was not very useful."
3,Starting your career as a marine mammal trainer,"It's a very concisely written book. It contains useful, but basic information (however it's sometimes the basics that are overlooked). This book would probably be suited more toward early high school-aged people or those who are keen to understand a little more about what is involved in marine mammal training (other than surfing dolphins for shows which is extremely appealing in itself).I found that the information given on further readings as well as the contact information for many marine parks and other institutions was the most useful and I will definitely be looking into many of those.A good starting point, but if you want detail, this is not the book for you."
3,comment on above comment,"Prior reviewer complained about it being ""used"" - my guess is that it was simply a little bit of water leftover from the FACTORY TESTING. What would you rather get - a completely dry pump that hadn't been functionally tested, or one that was tested-good but with a little water left in it?I don't own one, and have no connection to the company, just passing through. But as an engineer who designs reliable products that get tested before they leave the factory, I felt compelled to say something."
1,Used but sold as new,Opened the box removed pump and removed cap. Out came the water droplets had to use it but not an honest representation.
2,Not for a novice,I'm a novice player. Doesn't sounds anything like the real songs. You have to strum your guitar differently with each song to make it sound like the song. Maybe one day I will find a good book for beginners that I can use.
4,Great for a beginner,"This is a great book for a beginner. I played it all the time my 1st year. Yes the songs do not follow the originals but that's okay as it's scored to be ""Easy Guitar"". I still play songs out of this book from time to time. If you want a more accurate book, chose the black one or go with the ""Beatle Bible"" as I call it. For a simple book of Beatle tunes, this is a good choice."
5,Taught myself to play guitar with this book,"I love Beatles music and found this great book over 20 years ago and used it to help teach myself to play guitar. The book has easy to read chord fingerings and knowing how the song goes it made it easy to learn. I bought this for my brother so he hopefully can do the same thing. I have bought other music books that were much harder to read and understand. This one is perfect for me, hope it will be for you."
4,"Better than faking it, less than perfect","This is a really good Beatles book that works very well to let you play chord arrangements so that the Beatles songs sound about right. Great for playing for people who just want to sing some Beatles' songs. It won't actually give you much insight into how the Beatles played the songs, as some of the keys are clearly not the same as the album versions, and there is no information about multiple guitar parts. I also don't like music books in standard binding because you have to split the spine to get them to lay flat.Overall I would really recommend it for the casual player who wants to add a few (or all) of the Beatles' songs to their repertoire, as long as you don't mind them not being 100% of the album version."
4,Perfect for beginers and advanced alike,I have had this book now for more than twenty years and continue to play music from it with the same enthusiasm I had the first day I opened it. It is awesome to have it at mellow parties! Even those who normally don't care much for the Beatles apreciate it when one plays Beatle songs well and this book makes it totally posible. Most Beatle songs are there in extremely easy chord sequences that are still charming enough to be liked by nearly everyone. I have also use this book succesfully while teaching guitar to young and old. The book can make a singer / player out of anyone in a matter of days.
1,Hal Leonard should be shot!,"There are just TWO songs in this whole book which are remotely close to sounding like a Beatles song! I dont know how Hal Leonardgot the credentials to make a music book, but he better stick to something else! I was very dissapointed to say the least! Thereused to be a book called ""The complete Beatles"" (not by Hal Leonard), with a white cover, that was right on! It came out in the 80's. If anyone ever comes across that one buy it! or please let me know and I will be most appreciative."
1,The Worst Beatle Guitar Book I've Ever Had,The vast majority of the songs are in the wrong key... not bad if you feel like sitting around transposing them all... and even then there would be some incorrect chords.... and forget finding a single George Harrison (written) song in here.Honestly you're better off reading the crappy tabs online then get this book.It made me get good at transposing stuff on the fly... but it was quite irritating at the time. I'm gonna try to find a better one.Julie
1,this book sucks,"yep, the songs are way off. some are on, but a lot of them are full of errors. not only that it isn't even close to being 'complete'. there's another book out there that has almost every song and that one is VERY accurate. Get that one instead."
5,Excellent sturdy product,I've used this 3-hole pouch for several years ... it is a very rugid product ... made like a good pair of Levi Jeans ! I thought I'd just chime-in on this because I am looking for another pouch by American Studio that will be large enough to hold my IPAD.
4,Soap opera plus a mystery,"This is the third novel in the Hannah Ives series. I did not like it as well as the first two, possibly for the same reason I do not watch afternoon soaps. The first half of the book deals with family matters. Hannah's father is 70 and a widower. Hannah and her sisters are displeased that he is chasing after a younger woman. Hey ladies, he may be 70 but he's not dead (especially with Viagra on the market).After getting through the soap opera part of the novel, the mystery appears in the second half. A death occurs and Hannah's father disappears. Various characters are introduced in the novel, and all are not as they seem. The second part of the novel was more interesting, but not enough so to give the novel five stars (although if you like afternoon soaps, you will probably like the novel). Events seem to lead into a sequel."
2,Disappointing,"This is the third outing of Hannah Ives, and it was a great disappointment. The title gave away the mystery long before the end. The conversations reeked of cliches. Apparently Ms. Talley has lost interest in her creation. It makes you long for the lastest installment from Sue Grafton. After 17 books with character Kinsey Millhone, her stories are still as fresh as the first book.Maybe this is why Ms. Talley is spending so much time on the dull ""serial novels"". This is just a shame!Don't buy this if you must read it; get it at the library!"
4,"Great concept, , costly to use","This make really great coffe and is amazingly entertaining to watch but it requires nearly twice the amount of coffee as a drip machine and plastic become brittle with use. I have used mine daily for 14 months, lid has broken twice but it still works and makes great coffee."
5,Great Pen!,"Although I have not purchased this item through Amazon, I can testify to its quality. I am an assistant in a home tax business. This is the only pen I use either for personal or tax papers. Very comfortable grip, nice dark ink. Very smooth writing instrument."
3,A little pricey for the quality,"The problem is finding a decent case that will secure Motorola radios and not block the speaker and controls. I looked long and hard and finally settle on this one apparently endorsed by Motorola. The case fits the radio well, although if you plan on running or jogging you might want to add an additional rubber band or something to ensure that the radio does not slip out as another reviewer suggested. The designers could easily have added a strap to secure the radio. Overall with normal hiking the radio seems to stay in place. Time will tell but the materials seem to be kind of cheap for the cost. At $7.00 this would be a decent deal. The biggest problem I have with the case is that the case itself blocks some of the control buttons. You have to remove the radio to access the buttons. Too bad someone doesn't make a case that's actually built around the radio's controls and functions, they could sell thousands."
2,Talkabout Carry Case,The case holds the radio well - but it is not comfortable on the arm and can fall out of case. I bought the case for my ski vacation for my family to make it easier to carry the radios - but when you fall the radio most times falls out of the case. It needs a strap around it to hold it secure.
4,"Functional, but not designed for the T6400","Well built. Secure and functional for use with the T6400. (Note: Several online retailers advertise this accessory for the T6400, though it is clearly built for use with a smaller radio.)"
5,STRAIGHT FORWARD ADVICE,"A very engaging read. I appreciate this book's straight forward, easy to understand, relevant advice. I highly recommend it. Pamela D. Blair, Author The Next Fifty Years: A Guide for Women at Mid-Life And Beyond"
3,"Live to 100? Maybe, but not because of any ""new ""knowledge in this book.","No secrets in this, really! It is a pretty good reference for supplements, though, and beats rummagning through the various vitamin-providers' web sites to find useful information on whatever you might be considering taking. It's also packaged nicely, with a stiff cover which provides convenient flaps to use as bookmarks. So, yes, keep drinking your green tea, taking your glucosimine/chondroitin. SAM-e, etc., but, if you are reading this, then you don't really need this book to tell you, do you? If you are looking for ""secrets"" you won't find them here."
2,Secrets Of Longevity,"I was most disappointed with this book,due to the followingInsufficient depth of detailToo much of a general natureEach Chapter left out a lot necessary instruction"
3,Whew!,"If I followed all of Dr. Ni's recommendations, I would have to dedicate literally all my time and resources to my personal health care. In the meantime, while attending to my well-being, life [esp. family and career] will pass by unnoticed! The best way to read this remarkable book is to 'point and click' only a few things that ring your bell, and don't let the rest worry you because you cannot afford them or because you don't have the time. It would be useful and very interesting if Dr Ni had a chapter on 'The Bare Essentials' i.e. a list of 10-20 recommendations that he feels one must absolutely follow, w/o exception, w/o regard for cost or time."
1,Good info on ways to live to be 100,This books contains many good suggestions on how to get on the healthy track. Lots of good suggestion. Enjoyed this book very much!
4,great daria book,"This isn't a book about the history of daria or an episode guide. That stuff's been done to death. This is very original. It has letters written by the characters, Jane's artwork, photos, and stuff like that. I highly recommend this book to all daria fans!"
2,Interesting look but does not hold up well,"I bought this clock for my partner who loves it. But one year in, the cheap plastic clock mechanism died. We have spent months looking for a new mechanism that fits and that we can reuse the original hands. I would only recommend this clock if you are handy fixing things. Otherwise, not as reliable as it should be, especially considering the cost. We do like that the clock is made of metal and structurally seems quite sturdy - too bad it doesn't keep time."
1,unreadable!,"I used this text for a course with the author. The text is full of typos, incomplete explanations, and has an incomprehensible writing style."
4,Just Once!!!!!,"I like Pearl Jam. Really.And I like this book. Really.It's just that ... well ... let me be honest here: great photography, interesting camera angles, and the B&W;/color shifts are stellar and create a lasting effect; I just wish that once --just once -- the focus could shift to the viewpoint(s) of every OTHER member of the band besides Ed Vedder (the only time you really see it is in the photos of the fans -- for that, the book loses a star. Sorry, folks!). Maybe a sequel would be nice -- call it ""Those OTHER Guys"" and make them the subject matter.Still, this is a book worth having. Very recommended."
3,"Good book, but could have been better","The book is great, but as my title said, it could had been better. Pictures are explendit, they are really represetative of the band and at the same time a demostration of the talent of photographers Lance Macer And Chelsterson. My issue is that i`ve seen more of their work on internet and lots of the greatest pictures from these two are not into the book. Plus, I`d liked to see some text on this book. It barely has an credicts page and you`ll see no more text until the end of the book.I would recomend it to fans of the band if what you want is a soft recordatory from the old days. But would not recomend it to photographers who are seeking a great book for inspiration. For me it felt a little incomplete. Stell there are some great pictures on it."
2,okay if you don't mind pretense,"i was looking forward to this, but found it a little disappointing. the photography itself, which is granted, nice, seems the focus, as opposed to the photo subjects themselves. perhaps this was intended, but i'd have preferred photos that were more revelatory and that really showed the band in a new light than so much blurry, artsy pretense. the scrabble picture was funny, though."
1,"It is NOT bone china, but FINE CHINA","I received it but with great, great disappointment. The bowl was not crafted from fine bone china, but from fine china. The apperance was not as white as bone china. And on the bottom of the bowl you may find it said ""FINE CHINMA"".By the way, it is made in Indonesia."
4,That Midnight Kiss/The Toast of New Orleans,"Both DVD's are interesting,and colorfull. Mario Lanza, Kathryn Grayson's classical operetic abilities are supported by Jose'Iturbi'sMusical talent and exemplifies their outstanding ability in their music as well as their acting. Ethel Barrymore,and Keenan Wynnare alway entertaining and are excellent actors."
5,Mario Lanza,"I love opera, so I have enjoyed all of Mario Lanza's films and Kathryn Grayson's films. I think if he had lived, he would have been a great opera singer. This video shows what he can really sing, and it was very entertaining. I also think that Kathryn Grayson sang beautifully for time that these videos were made."
3,Pleasant Time Fillers,"These two MGM musicals star the singing talents of Mario Lanza and Kathryn Grayson-two of the most famous and best singers in the MGM stable at this time. I consider both to be great singers. However, the plots of these two movies are very slight. That reduces the star count on this DVD to 3 to 4 stars. However, if the viewer would like to skip from musical number to musical number, the star count would go up to 5 stars. The viewer would then get what amounts to a great musical concert."
1,That Midnight Kiss / The Toast of New Orleans,"It was mailed on time. The DVD's quality is unacceptable, the voice is so low, it's not able to hear, even though I adjusted to the maxum voice it's still not able to hear anything"
4,Sound Quality of That Midnight Kiss,The sound quality of That Midnight Kiss isn't nearly as good in this DVD as it is in a DVD of the same movie which I bought as a single about 10 years ago or so. Who knows why? Not me.
2,That Midnight Kiss/The Toast of New Orleans,"Mario Lanza had such a great voice, which is why I purchased these CDs. Stories are weak, but enjoyed the voice."
4,Excellent collection of stories.,I strongly suggest that any fan of Deep Space Nine pick up this book. The stories in those book add so much to the Dominion War story line without changing anything that aired in the episode each story references. Could not put it down and finished in two days.
4,A Great Anthology,"Tales of The Dominion War is an anthology that tells what was happening elsewhere in the Trek Universe during the final seasons of Deep Space Nine. A couple of the stories are average, but the bulk range from good to awesome. I'm not one to buy the trade paperback's (or hardcovers), preferring to wait for the cheaper mmpb to come out. Not being the first to read a book doesn't bother me. But I'm glad I picked this book up. It makes a great companion to the television episodes (especially if read while going through the DVD's). It's a fine addition to your Deep Space Nine and Star Trek collection."
4,No problems,"I've had this generator for two years. We used it a few times with our RV. I am building a pipe fence on our property and I have been using it to power a plasma cutter, air compressor, and various tools. It's worked great except my electric drill trips the fuse for some reason every now and then. Everything else works great. Might be the drill. It shut off when it got low on oil. Nice feature or I would have burned the motor up.Only drawback is that it's not as quiet as the Honda's. It's much cheaper though."
4,A Good Deal....,"I've got 10 thumbs and have trouble putting together 3 piece puzzles. That said, I had a bit of a problem getting the Nintendo hooked up since we have cable, a VCR and theatre surround sound coming out of our TV. I had to buy a special something to hook it up to where the cable hooks up. Other negatives are that you will probably want more than the Nintendo 64. Memory cards; controller cards; controllers; rumble paks; ect., ect.Now the positive. Once it's set up with all the dodads you want, it's a really fun game. My daughter and have spent hours playing Zelda, Nascar, Fight Kings, Pokeman Snap, Donkey Kong & Mario Carts. And we've only had it a week. I've found it a terrific way to play with my teenager and her friends and let them know the old man is pretty cool sometimes. Don't tell her that I get up in the middle of the night to practice!"
5,Atlas of World History,"Information is current, colorfully presented, and illustrated in a fascinating manner. Most would be happy to own this highly informative piece of reference material."
5,Under-rated kung fu classic,"I wanted to write this review to defend this under-rated kung fu classic. This film was directed by Liu Chia-Liang, the absolute finest martial arts director ever. While this film is very different than the other in the ""Drunken Master"" series, it is still excellent. While the other films contained a lot of stupid comedy and excellent old-school kung fu, this film is more serious and realistic. The fight scenes contain the same outstanding creativity as does all of Liu Chia-Liang's work, but with this film the fights do not contain the same attack-pause-attack-pause, pre-scripted feel. The fights are fast and frantic. The one bad thing about the film is that there are a relatively small amount of fights. However, if you are a fan of true kung fu, and not the wire-work suggested by the other reviewer, this would be a great film to check out."
2,2 1/2 stars - This film does not have Jet Li in it!,"This film does NOT have Jet Li in it. It also doesn't have Jackie Chan in it either. It DOES have some decent humor and a few decent kung-fu fights, but mostly is pretty weak. Andy Lau is in this one and is also under-used. If you liked Legend of Drunken Master and seek more like it - then look for Iron Monkey, Last Hero in China, Swordsman 2, Fong Sai Yuk 1 & 2, and if you want good Jackie Chan - look for Supercop, Who Am I?, and Operation Condor. This film isn't horrible, but you should probably pass on it anyway."
2,As described by other reviewers,"Product is cheaply made as described by others, but equivalent to the price. The logo on the hat is just a sticker which was stuck to the packaging and came off upon opening. As the options for Thomas are fairly limited, this is not a terrible costume and should last a few wears. Hangs down to just above the shoes of our 2yo so it would probably fit up to a 4yo."
5,Loved It,My son is really into Thomas the Train...He loved the costume and it was simple and easy to get on and off...He could move and trick or treat with ease...He was so happy wearing it...It was great...Highly rated from us...
2,Good way to lose CDs,"I'm a bit ambivalent about this product, but lean way toward the negative opinion side. These binder pages hold 8 CDs/DVDs each, with 4 slots on each side of the page. In order to get the disk into the slot, you obviously have to have an open side to the slot. Fellowes saw fit to make the open side of each slot so that it faces the open long-side of the binder. So if you carry the binder open-side down, the CDs will all fall out. Not too bright, Fellowes! My preference would be to have the open side of the slot face the binder's rings. Well, for my purposes - storing software backup CDs for system administration purposes - this will work. But I sure wouldn't want to use them for my personal music (or software) CDs, not if I wanted them to not get lost. I gave two stars because the product will do what it says it will do, so it is suitable as described. But I can't go higher than that because it doesn't do the job securely."
5,Reason priced and well made by Fellows,I like these that are from Fellows. They have a soft material like backing and a clear plastic cover on top to form the envelope and you can get four on a page. Reasonably priced.
4,Illustrated Dictionary of Historic Architecture,This book is extremely helpful when taking any Architecture History course. Everything I have needed to know is in this book. The diagrams are more understandable than my textbook.
3,Not bad for the price,My son is very excited about this kit. He has done a few of the experiments and enjoyed it. The description stated that most of parts were still sealed in factory packaging. Over half of the parts were opened and scattered in the box. There are so many small pieces that we are still trying to figure out if we have all of the pieces. Some of the small loose pieces are flat and could have slipped out of the seam of the box.
2,Too heavy for my taste.,"I had hoped to get an overview of the history of religious orders and their discontinuance, what I got was a very HEAVY sociolocal study. I threw the book away!"
3,Old Country Roses no longer made in England,"The quality of Old Country Roses used to be excellent. In 2002-2003, they moved their production to Indonesia, and then to China. The quality has dropped substantially since then, and so have the prices. You get what you pay for.- China-made pieces are heavier and thicker- China-made pieces have less accurate gold-workIf its any consolation, all the major brands of fine china are shifting production to Asia from England and Europe, with commensurate decreases in quality, and sometimes in price."
2,not as i expected,i think i expected more since previous reviews have said this product was a 5 star. i was not impressed with the quality. i don't know if i would get a better product if i were to order direct from royal albert
2,"Good for display only, gilt fades easily","If you are thinking about using Royal Albert china, be very careful when cleaning them. The gilt comes off so easily and the set does not look attractive with faded gilt. I used diluted mild dish detergent and very soft sponge but part of the gilt still disappeared after 2 wash. The gold on handle faded/discolored just by pressing my thumb on it. I put clear nail polish over the gilt to stop the fading, if anyone knows better ways to prevent the gilt from disappearing please enlighten me."
5,A Great Resource,This books takes you through the author's experience step by step of running several forms of acting/drama workshops. It takes you from warm-up exercises through different performance goals. I found the book very helpful in developing my own improv/acting workshops.
2,Air brush,"Great price and it feels good, but, I do a lot of intricate work; this airbrush is disappointing. To get the ""fine line"" the medium must be diluted so much, quality of the line is poor. I am going to convert to number two hardware rather than the number one hardware but that will cause the fine line aspect to be lost."
4,Love this Film,"You really can't go wrong with Steve Martin and Martin Short... I've seen the original with Spencer Tracy, and I love this one just as much. The second one is just as wonderful as the first. You can't go wrong with these. Great family entertainment."
4,Where's my Stuff?,I would like to know when my item will ship. I want to make sure my items are not damaged and will arrive soon.
1,The worst movie ever?,I'll try to keep it short and clear:Flat fake characters. Predictable story. Dozens of familie values. Cheap sentiment. Lacks any sense of originality.10 cliches every second.Typical Hollywood play-it-safe movie meant for boring conservative families with no taste.caspert79@hotmail.com
5,No Better Wedding Movie Ever!,"We love these movies - Steve Martin as the father of the bride and Martin Short as the ""Wadding"" Planner. How can it get any better than that??? They are especially endearing to us now as we are preparing for our oldest daughter's wedding in October - my husband IS George Banks."
2,DVD Skips,"Bought this as a Christmas present, and today is the first chance we've had to watch it. The first DVD played fine. The second started skipping about 1/2-way through. Even after cleaning it, it still skips. Pretty much unwatchable."
3,"Great movies, not so great DVDs","These are both wondeful movies, probably among my favorites, but I'm very disappointed with the DVDs. There are no special features. Is it really worth the money for the movie alone? This 2-pack is a great deal but I'm hesitant to buy it because I wonder if they'll be following up shortly with new special edition versions that include some features. That would be much more worth the money. With the feautures that are now included in most DVDs (even just deleted scenes would have been better) this is very disappointing."
5,PREPARING FOR A JUNE WEDDING,"I saw this a long time ago and now the date or me has arrived. This is my mariage prep course for Dad's. So, how do you give away an Angel? We are ready for fun, fun, fun, and so is this movie."
3,"Classic, but cheesey","I felt it necessary to watch this movie, sort of like a right of passage, since I'm getting married soon. And, for the most part, the first film in the series was entertaining and somewhat relevant to myself (my fiancé is also in IT). But if you watch both movies in a row, the second story gets old fast. I guess I kind of got tired of the characters. The price isn't bad for two movies, but the first is really all you need to get the ""wedding experience.""By the way, my dad watched it and thought the best part was Steve Martin's first visit to the in-laws. I don't think he paid much attention to the wedding scenes, lol."
4,Funny Movies,There are both great movies and a for a great price. I purchased them for Christmas gifts and my wife loved them!
1,Father of the Bride I did not play,"Unfortunately, or the second time Father of the Bride I would not play when put into the DVD player, while Father of the Bride II did. The first time this happened I contacted Amazon and thy sent a second copy, but after the same problem occurring again, I would prefer a refund please."
5,favorite show,This has always been one of our favorite comedies. It was in perfect condition and I loved the blu ray improvement.
5,A Duet Classic,This duet set is a classic comedy that combines humor and romance. Steve Martin is always very funny and entertaining.
4,a classic scent,"Pretty, without being cloying or excessively floral, this is a truly unique scent that dates back to the 1920's, but does not smell like an ""old lady"" perfume. It's my mother's favorite, and it's well worth the trouble to find it. Almost impossible to find in American stores now because of distribution contracts. Also, I have allergies to many scents, but find that this one doesn't bother me."
5,Great pocket guide I can take anywhere,"I find that the pocket guide is a very handy information source, with 'to-the-point' tips and guidelines on how to navigate your way through a complex Lean Office transformation. I use the pocket book every day to keep my clients on track and ensure my projects deliver to expectations."
5,LEAN OFFICE TOOLS THAT WORK FOR HEALTHCARE,"As a physician I am constantly researching methods to improve capacity utilization, staff recruitment and retention, nursing shortages, and cost management. We are challenged to achieve ambitious objectives within an organization of improved patient safety and increased client (patient) satisfaction. Healthcare cannot stand still. These daunting challenges are with us everyday. The Lean Office Pocket Guide has an answer. The Lean tools are clearly explained, and detailed to the extent that our process improvement teams can use immediately. Eventually, everyone in our healthcare system will have one of these pocket guides, as ALL must work to improve the healthcare system."
1,Great while it works...,"Bought 2 of these, one for a gift because we loved it. But we had to use it after the first pot's base stopped working. Used the second base with the first pot - the pot began leaking into it's base. Brought out the second pot - the base stopped timing the brew correctly, sometimes double boiled it, sometime never stopped boiling. The brew was really hot and the design did keep the coffee from getting bitter, but won't drop that kind of money every 6 months for a coffee pot."
2,disappointing and messy,"I bought this item when it was sold at Starbucks. The coffee is okay, but the filter between the top and bottom is flimsy plastic and will tear after a couple of months. Starbucks provided replacements, but only after ruining several batches of coffee (the grounds at the top end up in the carafe at the bottom). Not easy to clean - the bottom pot is not submersible in water, and the neck is very narrow and hard to get a sponge into. I thought it was fun to look at, but when reality set in I stopped using it."
2,Buy the Stovetop Santos Instead!,I have had both the stove top and the electric Santos and the stove top wins hands down. I found with the electric model I cannot choose how long the water and coffee brews - it is all automated. With the stove top - I can let the water and coffee brew together a little longer and I've found that it makes for a more complex cup of coffee. I have had the stove top model for years and thought that the electric model would be a nice upgrade - WRONG! The coffee tasted and looked rather weak when compared to my stove top. I eventually just gave my electric model to my local thrift store!
4,Review of Purchase,"The unit was exactly what I expected.It arrived promptly, and included everything I needed to start my first cup of perfectly brewed coffee. I'm very pleased."
2,Dissapointing,"When I bought this cd I was expecting something descent, not as good as the Slackers or Hepcat, but something different and decent. But instead I often got poorly arranged songs with stupit hyped lyrics more reminiscent of a pop albulm. They talk about living the 'rude boy life' but their instrumentals lacked the true spirit of ska. They had lots of horns but lacked the driving, honking, ring-a-ding feel of the back-beat and percusion of a good ska track."
4,Wonderful story,"Ida Mae has experienced many tragedies in her life, but she is a strong woman. She has endured a loving relationship with her husband, but it is brought to a sudden end along with the devastating death of her daughter. Despite these challenges in life, Ida Mae is still able to raise her son as well as raise her best friend's son, who was abandoned by both parents. The Director of Nursing at the senior citizen's home does a wonderful job telling Ida Mae's story. Although Ida Mae faces many challenges, it never makes her a bitter person. This book can be shared with women of all races and cultures as has many life lessons."
4,"Excellent, What If story","Excellent book, with a story that keeps you engaged throughout. The clashes between what is acceptable in the society of WWII versus present day adds to the drama. I'm looking forward to starting the second book of the series."
3,Finished to quickly.,Waited patiently for this book for 2 years. Started reading it and found it very enjoyable until the last 3rd. The reason for this is I realized in the last third of the book that there was no way the writer would be able to wrap up everything in the pages left. Well he did and I find it was not done too well. He closed out too many story lines way to quickly. I get the feeling he was writing and then realized that he had too many pages and would have to cut the endings/wrap-up short. And he did.Did I like the book? Yes. Was I let down by the ending? Yes.
5,Great Conclusion To A Great Series!,"After reading the first two books in the Axis of Time Series, I couldn't wait to read the third installment. I had to order my copy from Austrailia. It certainly didn't disappoint!As a student of history I always enjoy different takes on the past. This book(and series) takes it to a whole different level. The sociological changes that Birmo decribes could be a book all on their own. Add to that the action scenes and the different world that is created and this book goes down as one of the best books I have ever read in this genre.Even though this is the last book of the trilogy there is plenty of room for the story to grow. It certainly didn't end like I expected it to.If you want to read a great book that combines alternate history and a great novel, this book is for you!"
3,Doesn't live up to the previous books,"I really enjoyed the first two books in the series and have been waiting for the conclusion. When I got about a quarter of the way through this book, I felt like I was reading a different story. There were big holes in the story and the characters even seemed different. Kohlhammer was the only character that was consistent and likable.All in all, a disappointing end to the series."
3,"A bit mundane, but I want to read more","I like to read both alternate history (and historical displaements) and techno-military stories, so this one was right down my alley.I found it entertaining with some interesting twists and conflicts, but overall it was a bit predictable and maybe formulaic. Of course, there are more books to come in the series, so there is no real conclusion.Other reviews have given reasonable details of the book.My rating is probably somewhat conservative. I might have found the book more interesting if I had read the first two in the ""trilogy"". The book was definitely good enough that I have already put those two in my cart to acquire and read them."
3,Final Installment,"This book is (apparently) the final installment in the trilogy. The pity is that it is clear that the author was looking to end the series, having set up a pretty decent alternate history universe. The book is ok, and for those who want to see what the first two evolve to, is an ok summer read. Not as interesting as the first two, and again, a pity that the author rushed to completion on it."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"Absolutely atrocious ending to a very strong series. It seemed like the author went on auto-pilot. There was also no continuity between the end of the second book and now -- all these major subplots that we spent hundreds of pages getting into were just completely skipped. Totally feel ripped off, and I loved the series."
5,Good Show - Decient ending,This was a good ending to a great triology. I read it in one sitting. The action and characters were gripping. The down side was that it could of been thicker or part of a larger series. If you have read the fist two this is a must read. The intersection between a global military struggle and social conflict and development makes this a trilling medium.
4,"Great read, abrupt ending",I truly enjoyed all 3 books in the Trilogy. The problem is they leave me wanting more.
2,Third book disappointing,"As with many authors, the difficulty of wrapping everything up has eluded Birmingham. Not nearly as thought-provoking or insightful as the first two volumes in the trilogy.Most of the loose ends get tied, but in a pedestrian effort at knot-tying, not story telling.Better luck w/ the next one."
3,"Same book, different cover","Already bought and read this, thought I was getting a different book. Buyer beware! I will double check the product description next time to make sure I am not paying for a new book cover!!"
4,It Works,"Exactly as advertised. With a TV (Panasonic LCD) with only one HDMI input, I have the Direct TV and DVD (Panasonic with HDMI) running throuhg the switch. Therefore, you do not have to hit the video selector button on the TV. I have it set up so it defaults to Direct TV unless there is a disc placed in the DVD, then it plays the DVD, which is useful because I live with people who are 'remote control challenged', except of course for my [....] boy. I only gave it 4 stars because I can't live with giving anything 5 stars."
3,Half Baked Cake,"I've connected this device between my DLA-RS1U projector, a samsung BD-P1200 and HD Directivo. It flawlessly passes 1080p/24 with no problems (one of the two main reasons I purchased this switch). However, it does not switch automatically between the active sources. I have to use the manual switch to go between inputs. I've confirmed that device 1 is off when device 2 is on, and when I switch device 2 off and device 1 on, nothing!To make matters worse, I called Iogear's advertised ""24/7"" technical support. After spending 5 minutes trying to locate the switch on his screen, I was informed that technical support for the switch was only available Monday-Friday. I pointed out that their website didn't say 24/7 for every device but mine, but of course that didn't help.Hopefully they will get it working or they can have it back."
4,Outlaw at it's best,"Pretty simple: if you're a fan of Shooter Jennings and outlaw country, this is a solid live recording."
1,Musicianship lacking,"I bought this album and was disappointed. Weak musicianship and simpleton lyrics. I would think Shooter Jennings could have assembled a better band than this. Some of the most simple, poorly performed guitar solos I have heard. Maybe the studio albums are better, performed by studio musicians and Jennings gets dozens of takes on vocals. However, I'll pass on anything by Shooter and the 357s. 70's era Waylon and the Waylors blow this band so far away they land on another planet."
4,Dog-gone good!,Loved this puzzle! It was fun to put together and the puzzle piece quality is very good (which is why I gave it 5 stars for durability). You had to be careful as some of the pieces could fit in more than one place which made it all the more interesting and challenging. A definite recommend for anyone who enjoys putting jigsaws together!
1,piece of junk,I have had this TV for two and a half years. This morning the TV tube cracked for no apparant reason what so ever. Of course I didn't bother getting an extended warranty so no I am stuck with a 150 LB paperweight. THanks Samsung. I'll not be buying any Samsung products ever again.
3,pendant lights,"I receive these lights in a very timely manner. They are now hanging but I am disappointed in them. They hang by a ""cord"". (For some reason I thought there would be a solid rod with them.) The cord has not straightened with time and they have been hang for about 2 weeks. The biggest concern is that one of the 2 fixtures is not working. Since they had to be wired in to determine that, that is a big problem for me. I now have to have them taken down to figure out why it is not working."
5,killing Paparazzi,"first order, and was very pleased. Loved the book, Killing Paparazzi, just love Nina Zero books. great reading.Also read, burning Garbo, by Robvert Eversz : also great reading. Enjoy, Susy"
4,Fine history of a great band,This book is exhaustively researched and a thourough history of a great rock band. The fame eluded them but people in the know endow Big Star with a mythical status. The author presents an engaging history of not just the band but a period and feel of rock and roll in Memphis through the last three decades. Don't miss this if you are a fan.
4,substantial overcharge,"I recently purchased this book and I thought they were charging me the correct price. When the book arrived, I saw that they had charged me way more than what the book cost. I will never use Amazon or Javari books again. Although the book is well written, the list price is $16.95 and Javari books charged me $27.45. That's a $10.50 overcharge on a $16.95 item!"
1,Unsatisying,"I heard about this novel, in which the narrator has lost her voice, and I thought what a great idea! How is the author going to solve this wonderful problem he has created for himself? I imagined all kinds of interesting formal solutions. I ordered the book and was completely disappointed to begin reading it and find the narrator could speak just fine. She just TOLD us that she couldn't speak. Other characters in the book said, ""Gee, you gotta speak again soon,"" to the narrator. And that was it. And the book went on and on, a totally typical first novel. Though most of the book is spent in uninteresting and immature resentment of the (author's?) parents, there are a few nice bits between the sisters. Not enough to make the book anything other than a long clumsily written bore, though. If the author writes anything else, I might read it just to see what type of thing she writes after she's used up all her anger."
3,The book was alright,"I thought the book was alright, it was too busy for me. I wish it had more than one story like the other Richard Scarry's books."
3,"Cute Pics, Lame Story","As in all Richard Scarry Books, this one has really cute and kooky pictures, but I was highly disappointed with the storyline. A Day at the Firestation is SO much better!"
1,Counterfeit Scarry?,"My family loves Scarry. I spend probably 40 percent of my day reading Richard Scarry books to my 17 month old, because that's what he loves doing . I feel like I could find Richard Scarry in a parade, in the dark, with my eyes closed. Something about this book just ain't right. The drawings are sloppy and crowded. They don't obey the laws of physics. Huckle's dad looks like a knockoff. The colors are wrong... and lastly, the story just doesn't sound like it's written by the S-Man himself. Huckle never says, ""Wow!"" Sorry... we love airplanes but this book is creeping me out."
2,Not what I expected,"This book was not what I expected. The book is very silly and unreal, nothing real about airports. Also the quality was very poor as some pages were cut wrong and the pictures do not match. Some of the writing is cut off on the bottom quarter of the print."
2,Is this a genuine Richard Scarry book?,"I think this is one of the ""Richard Scarry"" books, not a genuine Richard Scarry. The pictures don't look quite right and the writing is all wrong."
2,Confusing but amusing,My 1 1/2 yr old laughs but I don't think it's bc the airplane is inside the airport. This RS I would not buy along w/ the bedtime stories one. The ULTIMATE RICHARD SCARRY is the Splish Splash Sounds book. Please and Thank You is really good too. There's some RS author controversy out there -something about the books not all being truly written by the RS author...
1,BURNT COPY,i COULDN'T GET THIS TO WORK SO i TOOK IT TO BEST BUY FOR HELP AND THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS A BURNT COPY. DON'T BE DECIEVED!!!!!
4,Badger better than no-name,"I had purchased a HF airbrush it worked but very fussy . I could tell it was a copy of the Badger 350 so I decided to get the brand name one .I am very pleased with the Badger airbrush easy to adjust, sprays better.I got the 350-4 the extra tips and small cup make it a good value."
3,Flip Flop 3 Pc Towel Set,These are adorable however they are cheaply made after the first wash the ribbons came off and I can see a hole in the bath towel. They were expensive for what I got. I would only buy the set for decoration purposes.
1,Poor customer service.,"I purchased this machine in November 2005. When working it is a wonderful but it started to leak within 6 weeks. I sent it back for repair or replacement, 3 weeks later I received a badly damaged box, not the shipping box but the Bodum box. The replacement had a manufactures date of 03/04, 2 years old. It had obviously been used, coffee and water stains were present several scratches, and parts were missing. I called customer service and the supervisor promised they would ship a new one immediately and I would receive it no later than 2/23/2006. Three days after I was promised I would receive the new machine it has yet to arrive. I called customer service today and was informed they have no record of shipping a new unit and could I call back next week. The very used replacement machine was shipped back last week.I regret making this purchase"
1,Bodum no longer making or repairing the machine,"Like most people, I went through steam and leak problems, electrical problems (replaced the machine twice during warranty). Well, it stopped creating steam, and starting leaking again, and then just quit entirely (two years old machine).I called Bodum and they tell me they no longer make it, and cannot repair it. No big surprise, but what pathetic service from a supposedly good company. They have sold us a bill of goods, and a very expensive one at that.Raj."
4,Love my machine,"I have had the Bodum Espresso Granos for over 2 years and have had no problem with it. The water container can be changed out with larger water bottles but I never did that since I felt that removing the water container might make it unstable or I might not replace it correctly. I love the flip top espresso cup storage and keep my cups there.I drink lattes and have made them twice a day almost every day. I always use bottled or filtered water in the machine. The only little complaints I have is that sometimes the shots of espresso that come out are not all the same amount. I remember there was a way to set that but I never did. Also, I usually warm my milk before I steam it because it is sometimes not as hot as I'd like. I get loads of compliments on the style of the machine and it almost feels like an art piece on my counter. I'm sorry that Bodum is not making these anymore but if you see one for sale, don't be afraid to check it out."
2,Very Uncomfortable!,"I received this mouse pad today and while using it, the pain in my wrist got worse and since the wrist pad is covered with leather, my wrist started to sweat and my experience with this product was awful. I will be returning this mouse pad. I would not recommend it to anyone that has wrist problems.3M Gel-Filled Wrist Rest With Integrated Mousing Surface, Black"
1,Gel too firm,"Like other reviewers who had purchased this product in the past, I got another and was bitterly disappointed in the change to the gel pad. What was once a soft, giving gel surface is now very firm. It defeats the purpose of having a wrist pad when it's this uncomfortable. The mouse surface seems as good, but the gel changed for the worse."
5,comfy mouse pad with style,"Very comfortable. Good size for most mice; could use a slightly longer surface. I'd really give it 4.5 stars for this reason. Surface works well for roller ball and optical mice. ""Sticks"" to your desk like it's supposed to. Looks like real black leather.There is a matching keyboard wrist rest that goes with it that I also recommend."
2,"Don't get the ""leatherette"" ones","I had a blue 3M Precise Mousing Surface for years and years, still worked great but the pad was starting to look really dirty, so I decided to replace it with one of these black ones.Huge mistake.Within the first few weeks the gel wrist pad had split open to reveal sticky innards, and now every time I put my wrist down it sticks to to the pad. At first I thought maybe it wouldn't be so bad, so I didn't return it, but the hole keeps getting bigger and more cracks are appearing in the wrist pad.The one you want is labeled ""foam"" and comes in blue with a water-drop background. [...][...]Avoid the ""leatherette"" one at all costs."
5,shape and color: the key to successful ceramic retorations,Escencial para todo practico en Rehabilitacion.
5,"Excellent, Perfect for the middle teens I bought it for, bought an extra copy for myself.","Love so many pieces of this book. Truly updated and encourages natural strengths. Well written for modern times. Love the chapter on personal style and the many real life examples of old and new public figures so you can really get a 'picture' sense of what the author is referring to.All women need this book, even if you have and use your manners. This has much that no one teaches you."
4,Interesting,"I really enjoyed this book. I admit that my idea of what being a lady meant was certainly more rigid than the authors'. However, after reading this book I think I can relax my definition just a little."
5,Busting myths - being a lady isn't about being subserviant,"Before this book the word lady symbolized a New England society debutant in a courtsy at her debut. It seemed restrictive but this book offers a more expanded and actually quite inspiring interpretation... being a lady does include stating your mind, having a leadership role, enjoying adventure, and so forth. It's like an etiquette coach once said - class does not equal cash. Ladies can be strong, wise, outspoken, but at its core ... it is about having self-respect and learning from our mistakes with grace."
1,Kind of a bore,"I guess I thought a book written about this subject by two savvy young women would be a little more witty. But I was wrong. With all the other books available on the market, I'd pick something else to spend your money on."
2,A pointless book,"This book has its heart in the right place, and I like that it is a call for courteous, dignified behavior. But there's nothing here that's new, there's much here that's meaningless, and there are a couple of things in the book that are just plain incorrect. And this was a very dull read -- the authors did not seem connected to their subject, and there was a lot of repetition. There are much better books out there; this one did not need to be published."
4,A lady can be tough!,"This book wasn't really what I expected. It was more about a being strong, independent, self-sufficient woman of integrity than arranging flowers and writing thank-you notes. All this made it a pleasant surprise and I'll recommend this book to anyone who's interested in reading about modern ladies who will most likely never be damsels in distress."
3,Not a book for a college girl!!,I was very excited about getting this book but when I read thru it in less than an hour. This isn't worth your money if you want to know something about self improvement stick with tapes by Anthony Robbins. The ideas that she discusses in this book are repetitive and your responses to her ideas will vary based on your moral system. What mom told you is better than what was in this book. What a waste of my money this stuff can be found free on the net. Don't waste your money- just go surfing and you can find a better resource.
5,Great buy!,Even though I didn't get to use this item very long due to me totaling the car it was installed in. This item was a great buy and I recommend it to anyone with a VW.
5,Plug and Play!,"This connector enables the installation of a wide range of aftermarket head units into cars that use the VW-style connector. These include BMW, Porsche, Audi, Mercedes, Chrysler Crossfire (a thinly disguised Mercedes SLK), and other cars. Simply wire this connector onto your aftermarket stereo power/speaker wires following the international color scheme (and most importantly the instructions in the aftermarket installation guide) and you can plug your aftermarket stereo into the cars factory wiring harness.Using this connector prevents cutting up the car wiring, which makes it easy to remove the aftermarket stereo later if you decide to keep with when you sell the car. Simply remove your upgraded stereo by unplugging it, and plug in the old factory stereo that came with the car!Considering the low price of this connector, it should be on every installer's ""must have"" list!"
4,Excellent!,"A wonderful, well researched book that challenges one (of the many) widely held misconceptions regarding apocalyptic literature. A must read for any Bible student (Hebrew Bible or New Testament)."
5,A real good movie,"I saw this movie on ABC's Wonderful World of Disney. It was very good. If anybody knows what book this movie is based on, please write it in their review. Thanks."
5,Totally Worth It!,"Don't you just hate it when you watch a movie and you're not satisfied with what you saw. Well I can assure you that your money won't be wasted! I saw this movie on ABC when they showed it and it's a must have if you're totally in love with Justin Timberlake! I don't want to give away the story so you'll just have to wait and see! But I can assure you one thing, you won't be disappointed! So just wait a few months until it comes out on tape and rent it or better yet buy it! Maggie Lawson is great in this movie and you can also bet that she's going to be the next Julia Roberts! As for Justin, be sure to keep your eyes open because it's for sure that he'll be doing more movies! All I have to say is that Justin looked absolutely adorable in this film so if you're totally stoked by him get it!"
2,Fearing the wrath of the teenies.......,"I'll have to admit, this movie is a sort of guilty pleasure. You realize from the beginning how incredibly cheesy and terrible the acting is, yet you can't seem to change the channel. Sure, Justin is ""so dreamy"" but he can't act worth anything. During some serious parts of the movie I found myself laughing simply because his acting was so terrible. So if you're looking for brainless fun, watch this. But if you're looking for something insightful, watch ""Proust in Love"" or something."
2,Model Problem!,"Well it was a change for me since i hate Justin Timberlake. But the plot was good, the girls are pretty hot! And it was very entertaining. The plot is not the most original. Its a ""trading places"" kind of a movie. One girl is a model and the other is a geek! Then the tables turn and they trade places. It was a very entertaining movie."
3,It was pretty good for Justin,"it was ok. I got this movie because the idea of Justin Timberlake acting was quite comical, but it was actually ok. It had a cute, if unoriginal plot, and the actors were pretty good. Not bad Justin."
4,"Overall it works well, but it will initially struggle with playing cds","Overall I am happy with this karaoke machine. My only complaint is that the machine often takes a while to play a cd properly which i find very frustrating. When I initially put a cd in the machine and play a track, it will often give me a message that indicates that it cannot play any songs on the cd. After stoping the player and playing it again a couple times, it will eventually play the songs on the cd without any problems. So the karaoke machine does get the job done, however, the initial waiting period for listening to play a song is annoying to say the least. I have not yet tried to play the Karaoke type CDs yet, so I can not speak to the effectiveness that this machine has playing this audio format."
3,So-So,"Got this for my kids (8 and 5) for the Holidays after much research. This seemed to be the best product in this price range. But it is spotty. The monitor is something out of 1952 . . old tube tvs and gets very very tired quickly. All of a sudden the lyrics disappear if you are also watching yourself on your own TV (connected to your TV) and has to be turned off. Also, when you switch CDs monitor doesn't work properly at first ... like it's warming up or something. And this is during the first hour of use! Can't imagine this thing lasting long. Not sure if I'm going to return it .. it's such a pain to do so . . but overall it's OK . .just not as great as advertised."
5,Great singing machine,"Quick delivery. Came in two days earlier than estimated arrival date. My 9 year old son and 6 year old daughter have had a blast on it. Easy for them to use and we've had some fun on it too. The screen graphics are a bit out dated, but we were prepared for that from previous reviews. Good purchase."
5,Karoake for Pre-Tween,My 9 year old daughter just received this as a birthday gift. She and her girlfriend loved it the minute they got it out of the box. We purchased the Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus karoake cds and they entertained themselves for hours. The adults enjoyed it as well and used the demo cd for their own fun. If you are looking for something really small this isn't it though. It is large in size approx 2' tall x 1' width. I should have checked the size prior to ordering. I would be willing to pay for color display if available. Great product for the price.
4,karaoke machine,I purchased this singing machine (as it's called) for my daughter-in-law as a birthday present. She tells me she's enjoying it and now I have more gift ideas for the future - namely karaoke CD's. I was pleased it was delivered in a few days - in time for her birthday party.
5,Beautiful Display Case,This is a very beautiful display case! Nothing cheap about it and I liked that fact that it had glass. Very well made. You won't be disappointed.
5,Very nice. Burial flag looks good on the shelf and will stay clean.,Mom was really tickled. Didn't know how to display dads burial flag. Now she has it in a very prominate place and doesn't have to worry about it getting dirty.
5,"Great Case, Great Price","This case was great quality, arrived in perfect condition, and it was hundreds of dollars less than the comparable cases made in America."
4,Hard getting it into the case:,"Flag case in Cherry wood tone looks rich & respectfully appropriate,as in, no frills. I had a hard time closing it, so I had to re fold my husband's flag into a smaller triangle so it fit into the case and then it finally closed."
5,Great Case!,Very nice case at a very reasonable price. I had both of my cases two days after I ordered them. Highly recommended.
5,stunning,I received the case for my late father's flag today and it is beautiful - just what I wanted. I think he would have liked it too.
3,"Good for shelf or table, not hanging","The flag case looks real nice on a shelf or table. However, I was not able to hang the case. Even small screw-in eyelets made for hanging pictures split the frame of the case in the back and would not hold. Rather than returning the flag case, I decided to buy and mount a small shelf to hold the case. The case looks good holding my dad's veteran's memorial flag."
5,Good Quality,"I am very pleased with the quality of this flag case; it makes a dignified, tasteful display, fit to honor a man who served his country."
5,Good quality and value - but made in Vietnam,"This item, as others have mentioned, is quite reasonable for it's price. However, the box indicates it was made in Vietnam - this might be a deal breaker for someone purchacing this item to display a Vietnam Veteran's burial flag in."
1,poor product,"The cherry version of this flag case was extremely poorly made. It was extremely difficult to get the flag into the case and the back portion fell apart (made of particle board) when we tried to close the case. However,the vendor was quite nice and sent us a replacement in Oak, which she said was made in North Carolina (in contrast to the made in China cherry version) without additional cost. The flag fits into the oak version without difficulty and the product appears to be solid."
3,"Great design, bad support","It's too bad is all I can say about this product. I loved it when it first came out. Visual indicators, surround sound, digital outputs (coax and optical), headphone/mic ports in the front, large volume knob, mute button front and center - this was the best innovation in sound for PCs since SoundBlaster. When the software was updated, I loved it even more. Unfortunately, Philips decided to abandon it like it abandons its other products (see earlier Streamium products). I set up a new PC, and the on-board soundcard doesn't work with Vista. Plugged the PSC805 in, Vista found a driver, installed it - and still no sound. There's not even an option to force digital mode in the Vista drivers - so neither analog nor digital outputs work (I tried all of them). Yet another disappointment from Philips that just supports my current decision to avoid the brand completely when shopping for a large LCD TV now."
5,Awesome but...,I would rather recomend going with the E-flite blade cx if your a beginner. i still like this helicopter even though I need to constantly buy replacement parts. I would recomend this to people who have been flying nitro 30. size and 50. size.
3,too advanced,This product did not specify that it was for advance flyers. It should have recommended the red helicopter for beginners.
5,Marianne is Today's Spiritual Force,"I just wish she'd produce MORE. As always, Marianne takes a difficult spiritual topic such as anger and makes things simple and uplifting. She calls it like it is, using her own experiences (and failures) to assure one and all that we are the same. Pretending anger doesn't exist is not spiritual. She goes on to explain that it's not that we wouldn't have any negative emotion...it's that we wouldn't have any negative emotion that we are not willing to give up. Aaah. Relief!Even if ""Jesus"" is a word that makes your bristle, you can't go wrong with Marianne's books or tapes. She recognizes that there are many paths and Jesus is just one (after all, she IS Jewish!) :)"
2,DON'T BOTHER,"THIS WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT I WAS EXPECTING; I WAS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO EXPLORE ANGER IN SITUATIONS THAT I COULD RELATE TO, BUT I WAS ASKED REPEATEDLY TO PRAY OR TURN OVER MY FEELINGS TO GOD. I WANTED A CLINICAL BOOK, NOT THEOLOGY; VERY DISAPPOINTING"
1,A coffee table book that will disappoint any reader,"The tagline for the book implies that it might actually teach a reader the basics of creating a role playing game, and it does, to a certain extent. A good analogy would be a book claiming to teach the reader how to build a toaster, and then offering helpful hints like ""A toaster must heat bread"", and ""a toaster should be an attractive color"".If you have ever actually played a role playing games, you would already know most of the material covered in this book. In fact, the written material could probably be covered in a much smaller volume, since 3/4 of each page, sometimes more, are covered with glossy screenshots from a variety of role playing games.The casual reader will find this book completely unappealing, and anyone with the goal of creating a game will find it lacking."
1,Arabic Nonsense!,I was unfamiliar with Get Fuzzy 'til somebody gave this calendar to me as an April Fools joke. I can't believe how bad this strip is. At least we now see Bloom County returning in the Sunday comics to remind us of how funny strips used to be.
3,only for the beginner,"it's good in illustration and good in description.but only for the children(or very beginner) for pratice.it contains 3~4 steps only(devant and derriere each), so it can be used only for a BASIC reference."
3,Works good for awhile,"I've had one of these for a few years and it worked great for awhile, but the countertop suction looses its ""oomph"" after some time. It still works, but you have to try a bit harder to get a good seal. This particular product was mailed just in the factory box (not even taped shut over the flimsy cardboard tab that keeps it closed), so you anyone could easily see what it was and take it (or part of it) right out of the box during shipping or while it sat on my doorstep. It looks like someone bought a bunch of these when Linens N' Things was going out of business and is now selling them online, because it still had the Linens N' Things tag on it (for $10 more than I paid)."
5,surprisingly great,the price was really good so i figured i'd check this survival kit out. i was not disapointed. it has alot of suff for the price but its all really compact so it doesnt take up alot of room. you could throw this kit in a BDU pocket and be on your way. it comes with a really awsome water proof bag. this kit is a great starter kit and really good if you just going hiing a short way.
1,Another Bad Game,Another game to avoid. I turned this game off after about 5 minutes yea it's that bad. avoid at all costs. 1 star.
5,Nothing Ever Happens....,"My favortite book of the summer. I have recommended it to everyone! A very funny story about how a boy who, unbeknownst to himself, becomes the talk of the town."
1,What Kind of Fool am I?,"In the past, I've purchased 3 other (lesser model) compasses from PNI. All broke within one year. The V6000 was no different. It lasted about two months. It's said that truly neurotic behavior is characterized by repeating the same behavior over & over and expecting a different outcome each time. I must be sick.Customer service at this company is no better than its products, as one might expect. I suggest a nice Airguide battery-powered compass. It hasn't failed yet.The ""ice alert"" feature would be nice if the device were reliable at actually picking up temperatures accurately. It isn't.It's a wonder this company can stay in business."
2,The price of this product should get you more,"My foremost complaint on this product is it's frequent inablity to do simple math. Go any direction, then turn and go the opposite direction. Not sure where the designers of this product took their math classes, but my Boy Scout handbook says that's a change of 180 degrees. Why does this compass say 160 or even 140 degree difference sometimes? My magnetic compass, certainly a lot less expensive than this product, doesn't get confused. Calibrating the product weekly helps, but not sure I want to spend each Saturday turning my car in circles for the benefit of my compass. Finding my car 400-800 feet higher than where I parked it last night has always griped me as well. But I guess you can't expect more out of an altimeter based on barometric pressure. Otherwise, at least it seems to denote change in altitude fairly accurately."
2,Too Many Cords!,"This item is not well designed - the only place to put it is on your windshield and then to fully utilize all of its functionality, you need to have 2 cords dangling from it - 1 to a power source, the other out of your car to get the external temperature!"
4,If this is the 1963 edition --,".. get it! And if you can find the Fine Arts Quartet recordings (originally on Concert Disc lps) from a few years earlier, get those, too.I copied my lp set to CDs, putting quartets 3,4,and 5 together on the second of 3 discs; the third disc holds the 6th Quartet, coupled with a Rudolph Barshai recording of Bartok's Divertimento for Strings, duplicating the program of the 3-disk Tatrai set of Bartok quartets.I give 4 stars for breaking the 4th quartet over two discs. Musically, if this measures up to the lps on most equipment, it deserves 5 stars."
5,"Excellent instructions, beautiful illustrations","This is an excellent book for any student of Japanese ink painting. The author's clear instructions focus on technique as well as the spiritual side of sumi-e. The illustrations are exceptionally beautiful & worth the price alone.The book starts out by discussing materials as well as a student's mindset. Line brush strokes, washes and calligraphy brushwork are then detailed & illustrated.The author then talks about the four gentlemen of Japan. They include the orchid, bamboo, plum & chrysanthemum. Because they are so varied, practicing these has really helped my paintings improve.Many other subject types are covered. Some include grass, flowers, trees, fruits, vegetables, birds, and animals. Landscape element techniques encompass rocks, clouds and mountains."
4,Rampas 19th Work,"Anyone who enjoyed `Cave of The Ancients' is likely to enjoy this book which focuses fully on the amazing adventures and experiences of Lobsang and his beloved guide in a vast system of caves created some 3 million years ago. From alien craft and bodies in suspended animation, to witnessing the history and changes of earth and it's inhabitants through a fourth dimension. Read some extracts from the book here: [...]"

1,Don't waste your money,"It doesn't work and it stinks. Literally. Here in North Texas, the June bug capital of the world, there should have been thousands of interested parties. But nope, not a one could be bothered. A total waste of time and money."
5,Play toy,Length is a nice size. The inside measurement is too small. A larger inside measurement would have been better. I would look for another product in the future.
3,Nice packaging,"Very nice packaging. Candle smells good, hopefully will havestronger scent when burned"
2,"good scenery, good acting, bad movie.","There are 2 reasons to see this movie (and only 2). Really beautiful scenery, and wonderful acting by Kenneth Branagh. Other than these, I found the story underdeveloped, and the movie ended just as it was beginning to get interesting. We see some flashbacks of DH Lawrence's life. However, whereas the cover of the movie suggests that the focus would be on the relationship between DH Lawrence and a married woman, this relationship is not the focus of the movie. In fact, this is a movie that looks at DH Lawrence, without focusing. Therefore, one is surprised when the movie ends, but not sorry."
4,Excellent Read,"Having read numerous Eastern Front narratives recently, I felt as if I needed a change of pace. This book did the trick. The Commonwealth's troops and Rommel's Afrika Corps had somewhat of a chivalry between them. This is in glaring contrast to the hellish Russian steppe battles. As an earlier reviewer states, the authors do not use all 400+ pages to write about the actual Alamein battle. For anybody new to the North African war, this is an excellent primer. The side stories alone are quite interesting... almost Stephen Ambrose-ish. A recommended follow up book would be Rick Atkinson's ""An Army at Dawn"" which begins with Operation Torch, loosely where ""Alamein"" breaks off."
4,Well written overview of desert war,"Published in the UK as ""Alamein, War Without Hate"". The American edition's subtitle is misleading, as the book is an overview of the whole desert campaign culminating in the Battle of El Alamein itself. Being an overview, the book lacks some depth, I think. On the other hand, it does cover a lot of ground: strategy, tactics, supply, political demands, intelligence (including the American Atache in Cairo's tell-all messages being intercepted), LRDG, Malta, Lilli Marlene, the works. There are a few books that offer better analysis (""The Desert Generals"" for example) but as an introduction to the desert campaign this is tough to beat: Well written, fast moving and very enjoyable. PS-I almost gave it 5 stars and maybe I'm just mad because I wish it had been longer."
2,"Factual inaccuracies, uneven prose","Very good at times, but this account of the entire desert war (so if you're looking for info just on El Alamein, I guess it's a bonus) jumps around and goes off on tangents. It is also very 'chatty', giving info on individuals that would be better served in a work on the 'behind-the-scenes' stuff. Overall, pretty disappointing"
5,Great Game,This is a fun and entertaining game. It is a game that I previously owned and used it so much it didnt work anymore and I wanted to replace it.
4,Beware of seller misrepresentation,"In all the ""New"" ones for sale that I have seen, the sellers admit that it is, in fact, NOT NEW. Frankly, the fact that Amazon doesn't do anything about this blatent lying does not instill much confidence in me about their system.That said, This is a wonderful game. it's the game that first got me to actually PLAY rpgs, as opposed to just watching my friend play them. It's a Square RPG, too, so it's not like Nintendo just paid some two-bit developer to hack out a crappy Mario tie-in (unlike most of their older Mario tie-ins), They went with the best of the best, and it shows. Beautifully 3-D rendered (for the SNES, I mean) and a joy to play. Definately worth buying if you are morally opposed to emulation."
5,One of the best SNES games i've played,"My dad got this game for me when I was about 6, and I fell in love with it from the start. I got the game used, and it was almost finished. In fact, the guy who had it before us was at the very last part of the game. I got out of the last castle and worked the plot backward to see how it came out. Then, I started a new game and was about halfway through and I started the system and the game crashed, erasing all my good memory and replacing a file I had deleted a while back. I haven't picked it up since then and its been 8 years.-Willsburo"
3,a great game!,when i was young i was more into mega man games and typical mario side scrollers this made me get into rpgs! after this awesome expirence i played all kids of rpgs i highly recomend it
2,Not very good.,Like i said i do not like RPGs and especially this one. I have it because of course its mario and im willing to try any mario. It takes so long to beat it because the RPG and it gets on ur nerves when u cant beat a boss or enemy and u have to restart and beat them. At the begining it has some cheesey video of what happend to peach. It took me forever to beat it and as soon as i did i felt much better and it did not seem as much as a dumb game. The graphics r ur ordinary snes graphics and the sound is not as good as most snes games. I dont like it because its an RPG but the only reason i keep it is because it adds to the collection and my little cousin loves to play it.
1,???,I have never heard of this game but am a big mario fan so i bougt it. unfortunately it did not work but the seller was glad to refund me the full price and i didnt have to return the game.
3,annoying!,"The storyline in the game is great. The graphics, amount of challenge, and gameplay is also great. What's NOT great is the music. The fact that the same theme has to keep popping up whenever the screen switches to the turn/based battle screen is annoying to me. I HATE that theme song. You can't avoid it either, unless you turn the volume on the television down.I also hate the game because of bad memories connected to it. The game was released during a time I truly didn't care about life. That memory is still connected to the game, unfortunately. Don't let MY negativity stop you from buying this supposed classic, though. It has a friendly Bowser, and no Luigi. Odd, but true."
5,"It's from Square, what did you think?","Square has done beautifully in making the hop n' bop classics into an RPG. The story is very original and intriguing: As usual, Princess Peach is captured by Bowser. You, Mario, must head out and find her but soon, as you pick up handy items and willing characters, Geno the living doll meets you. You have a wierd star which he informs you is from his home star world and he has being trying to retreive them. Noble Mario and your early partner Mallow take this quest to find the stars and discover it leads to Bowser's castle. And here's a real killer: Bowser joins your team! When the cutscenes go on, you don't get the urge to zip through them; they have funny scenes and humorous remarks to keep you watching. With near 64-bit graphics and 3-D enviorments, you can have lots o' fun! (I hope you like turn based RPG's!)"
5,Quick Review: Excellent Game,"Super Mario RPG is a great addition to your SNES game collection. As the title implies, it is a turn-based RPG set in the Mario world. The game was made by Square (makers of the Final Fantasy series), so it's top quality. And, if you've ever wanted a Mario game where you can play with Peach or Bowser, this is the game for you. It's like any of the Paper Mario games, if you've played them, but more of a standard, Final Fantasy RPG approach rather than a kid's RPG approach. The game is relatively easy compared to other RPGs, but is good for relaxing and having fun. One-player only, 4 save files. For more in-depth information, go to www.gamefaqs.com, search for Super Mario RPG, and click reviews."
5,One of the best Mario games ever,"I love this game, honestly need to remake this game with updated graphics and lengthier storyline with a lot more features on it... It would be the best if they could do it again."
5,Great classic game!,"This game is definitely a classic, but don't expect this game to be a cakewalk. this game can be downright tough in some places, especially the beginning. Great story as well. I can't say i won't be putting this game down anytime soon."
5,The Best Game Ever!!!,I thought this was one of the best games ever made.I liked how you got charachters that weren't evenfrom other Mario games!You have to buy this game!
3,No rings included,"Scope is fine. The cross hairs are a little thick. Only problem was that when I ordered it, the description said ""... Scope with Rings."" No rings included and Amazon.com has no provision for providing missing items. My only option was to pay the shipping fees to return the scope. Cost less to buy rings locally. Amazon needs to change there procedures to allow claims for missing or damaged items. Had similar problem before. Can be a major expense and headache with a heavy or large item."
3,Purchased for an SKS,"This was a good scope for a .22 perhaps because I believe its main goal was for the Airsoft world.The reason I say this is because this scope cannot hold a Zero on an SKS to save it's life,or you're own for that matter, and the SKS has relatively low recoil.I took this to the range and fitted it to my Rear dust cover scope mount, (AKA receiver cover) and it could not hold zero at 100 yards now this modest task should be easily achievable with even a low end scope but it failed giving me a good foot and half spread.Used a bipod for sighting no rear sandbag.Save yourself some money and get a better one this one will let you down.Unless you are buying for .22 or a BB gun or something of the like. Cause the scope itself looks good so i put it on my 10/22."
4,Nice Scope,"Very excellent scope. I love it. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS: It doesn't come with anything to mount it with. (And if it was supposed to, I got jipped.) So make sure you also buy a weaver ring!!!"
2,36 PIECES OF MUSIC O WELL?,"Yes, 2 stars for all the work related by learning so many pieces. As for the music did not care at all. I believe he is too technical and no flavor or as one might say not delicious.VICO"
5,perfect for our needs,"This product was perfect for what we needed it for. It installed easily, looks good, and is unobtrusive."
2,Broken,One of the key holders was broken when I received this item. Too much of a hassle to return it and needed to be able to give it as a gift so I didn't have time to return it either. I was less than satisfied...
4,great product,"I am very happy with the purchase. It goes well with my chrome hardware, etc. It freed up alot of space on my table because now I have space to put bills, coupons, etc. the only thing I recommend those moms out there, make sure you mount it high enough that you little one cannot reach the key hooks. I did not so now I cannot hang my keys because he takes them off the hook, my fault though. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that is look a little cheap when you get up close, some of hooks are not quit. But its not a huge deal, its sturdy and does its purpose very well!"
2,Holds mail to the wall - after you straighten it out,"My unit arrived severely warped. It was bent on a diagonal, so if you tried laying it on the wall it would lift up about an inch and a half on 2 corners. I muscled it back to ""sort of straight"". Screws flattened the rest of it.Within a week one of the key hooks on the bottom broke off. It's tack welded on and is not very sturdy. Don't try and bend them straight (again, one of them was bent on mine).I'm sure my review might be higher had mine not arrived damaged."
4,Good organizer,This mail as well key organizer is really good only thing to keep in mind the nails provided are for wooden surface only.I used command hooks (4) to put it on wall b'coz we r not allowed to put nails in our house. It has really sorted out my all mails and keys love it
3,It's alright...,"This item had a hook that was off, that on closer inspection, was not tacked on good. Didn't buy for hooks, so just kept it to avoid the hassle of return."
3,an ok cd,"I wasn't impressed with this cd. She does talk way to fast, I have to agree with the other reviewer. If she could of slowed it down I would have loved it.This cd would be good to listen to when you don't want to meditate, maybe in the car, house cleaning, or working out. It makes you think real positive and gives you a boost of confidence.I do recommend Angel Medicine or Past Life Regression for meditating. I love her work.... this one just wasn't for me."
2,"Too fast, not what you would call a soothing voice.","After listening to Kelly Howel and few others , Dorreen's voice is just not soothing enough for guided meditation. She talkes way toooo fast for one thing. She reminded me of a very nasal sounding teacher I had in school once. It may not bother someone else but for me, I like a soothing voice. Now what she says is good, but she talks so fast you miss it, and if your trying to get what she saying, you know your not relaxing well, and there goes the meditation. Complete wast of money for me."
2,Not as expected...,"Although I am a huge fan of Dr. Virtue's work, I was dissapointed by this audiobook, particularly because during the meditation process I couldn't follow her.She talks very very quickly, and I missed the soft, soothing tone in her voice. I own 7 audiobooks of hers, and this is the only one that didn't pleased me.English isn't my mother language, still this didn't affect my meditation process with other audiobooks.With this one, as soon as I was affirming a sentence, she had already jumped to another, and another, and another, with a fast pace, and in the end, I was feeling that the whole process never completed fully. To her credit, when ,in some cases, managed to follow her, the process of releasing worked! I was actually trembling in some issues, such as violent death!! If only she was speaking with a more warm tone and a slower pace..."
2,OK for Beginners,"I admire Dr. Virtue and her Healing with the Angel cards are absolutely incredible. But when I purchased this tape, I expected something a little more educational.The message I took from this is that if you pray and visualize, your negative karma can be taken away. It seems like the meditation just focuses on and repeats that message, which I found overly simplistic.The tape is ok for neophytes -- but if you're looking for something with a little more meat, try some of her other materials. Even for neophytes, I would highly recommend Marianne Williamson's Return to Love tape over this one."
5,great for letting go,I think this is a great cd for letting go of things. I felt a lot lighter after listening to it. I was supprised at some of the past life things it felt like I let go.
3,Was okay,The cd collection was okay but the karma releasing cd wasn't good as she spoke too fast which made it impossible for me to repeat the words that she asked us to repeat.
2,Too fast to meditate on Karma Releasing,"I would say that even though the information in the CD is ok, you can't enjoy it because she talks sooooooooooooo fast, it doesn't invite to stop and think but rather just to be as concentrated as possible to be able to understand/listen to all that she says. If you get distracted one second analysing something she said, she is already in another idea and you have no clue of the relation.Did not like it, it should be slower to let you have a moment to meditate what she is saying, not talking as if it was a race to see how fast she can tell everything to you."
4,As expected,Purchased for our Sunday School - Little too thin for the smaller kids (preschool-K) but works great for the rest.
4,Excellent airplane material,"I enjoyed this book, as I have all of Ian Rankin's John Rebus writings to date. These are short stories that are quick and absorbing reading. Nothing is particularly heavy, but all are very clever. I wanted to move to the next after I finished each. That's my definition of a good airplane book. And, Rankin is such a talented writer."
5,A good collection,"This is a collection of 12 short stories featuring Inspector John Rebus. They tend to be quick reading, without an excessive amount of background color. I would recommend the collection for readers who like to cut to the chase, and want some occasional quick reading material. It is a good book for commuters or travelers on long trips, or perhaps to take to the beach.The stories have interesting plots, and are set in the present day (more or less) with car phones, answering machines, etc. They will give you a different picture of Edinburgh than what you see as a tourist.I am surprised that I previously missed the collection, but I found it at a book sale."
3,Basic Inspiration for Dreaming,"I have to admit I didn't ""fall on the floor laughing"" nor did I cry but I do think Christine's book is inspiring for the beginning dreamer. Basic advice and inspiration to get you started and on the road to your dream."
2,Not Practical,"Only a single page provided for names and addresses and a tiny space for telephone numbers, which, for most people, won't work in this age of multiple phone numbers."
2,Altiile better than average for the genre 2 1/2 stars.,This is the best book in the series which has been disappointing overall. Quite a bit of spanking which is not particularly erotic but a couple nice erotic scenes. The characters are better developed here with Lisa and Teresa showing definite submissive tendencies and some inclination towards being bi. Teresa wants to move in with her uncle when her step mother remarries and this complicates things as his long time lover is moving from Boston to be with him. Coincidental plot but not horrid. Not great but much better than other books in the series.
3,This book is still available in the U.K.,"This book, and many others by this author are available from Pallas Armata in the U.K. Email Gareth_Simon@Londonelec.co.uk for details."
2,issue with intel based macs,"beware of this product if you have an intel based macintosh, i have a g5 at my work and an intel core duo imac at home, the hard drive works perfectly fine with the g5 but it can't be connected to the intel one, it looses the connection a few seconds after,also performs erratically if connected to a g4. apparently only works fine with g5's"
1,My Mistake !!!,"Knowing what I know now, I would never have purchased this external hard drive because of the extra hardware and software that I had to puchase to get it to operate. The one thing that I can say good for Seagate : they have a great technical support staff."
4,Seagate Drive,"This is a great drive. It is fast, silent, and seems to be reliable. It works well with my PC and Laptop. However, there are two minor quirks. 1)I use an IBM Thinkpad X31 laptop. When I boot up with the Seagate drive plugged into my USB port, my IBM system won't boot up unless the Seagate drive is disconnected. I changed my BIOS boot priorities to ignore the Seagate drive, but that didn't work. 2) The drive comes with two ""pigtails"" on the USB cable. One ""pigtail"" is labelled data + power, the other pigtail is labelled power only. It seems like this drive may consume more power than other drives and Seagate was forced to add an additional pigtail to draw power from a second USB port. Apparently, my PC's USB port provides enough power so the 2nd ""pigtail"" isn't used.If you want a good, reliable drive, you can't go wrong with a Seagate drive."
3,Don't forget the cable!,"Good drive overall; silent, compact and feels solid. Just don't forget or lose the cable! A standard 6' USB 2.0 cable apparently will not provide enough power get the drive running. And the special 'Y' cable is not a commonly available item."
1,WORKED AWESOME UNTIL THE WARRANTY EXPIRED..then it broke,"I thought this was the greatest portable external hard drive ever made. It worked flawlessly and reliably...until the warranty expired. In fact the hard drive expired three days after the warranty did. Nice.Seagate has a great reputation, but I also had Seagate internal drive, which broke on me in about two years. This external one only lasted one year.I'm getting Maxtors for now on. I never had problems with them."
5,Best Special occasion dishes ever,"I bought these for my family many years ago for special occasions, we suffered a breakage last year due to a bowl being dropped on the plat ordered with this order. it came qick and in graet shape, reasonabley priced too."
2,Definitely NOT A 120$ KNIFE,This was listed as retail for 120$???? When I got the damn thing the blade only had detail on one side. It didn't even get sharpened on both sides. Almost like it was machine pressed or something. Terrible knife.
1,This THING !,The knife sucks... I thought it would be a decent knife. I guess it's what you pay for. but this knife has no sharpness when i got it. the sheth also broke in 2 days. it's a knife that has show but no game...
3,Henrik Ibse Collection,I really like the DVD but sorry it didn't have Closed Captions as I don't hear well. They did not speak clearly (because of accents I guess)Otherwise glad I got it.
1,Absolutely terrible!!,"This book is one of the worst french books i have ever seen. This one is the first one so you would think it would have just a little more english than french to help the students understand french grammer, writing styles, etc. But it doesnt, everything is in french and the authors dont explain anything. No voc list! just a bunch of words mixed together. The authors wrote the book for litte middle schoolers. Lots of little play songs and games, YOU DONT LEARN FRENCH. The other level books are just as bad as well. The kit we got came with a vissual tape and CD-ROM, that was even worst, the speakers were way to fast and the drills didn't help you if you weren't in those particular situations (I lost my keys and stuff like that)."
1,Who does fabio zanon think he is?,"As a classical guitarist myself, I can appreciate the technical aptitude of Fabio Zanon on this Cd; however, it is his musical integrity that I call into question here. My primary example is Etude 11. Fabio not only changes the score, but inserts new parts of his own volition. Does Mr. Zanon think he is a better composer than Villa-Lobos? A better musician or a more musically astute person? I find his grotesque mutations of a beautiful piece repugnant to the extent of musically criminal. If you like hearing Fabio Zanon desecrate Villa-Lobos original works, then this is the CD for you. If you prefer Villa-Lobos in his pure and original state, then I suggest you look elsewhere."
3,"Good plot and settings, somewhat lacking in execution","Set in a fantasy world consisting of sorcerers, scheming politicians, charming characters and well-personalised countries, I found Left Horse Black a highly creative novel with smooth paced action.The elements that annoyed me after a couple of chapters though were the dialogue, which I sometimes found to be dubious and drawn out, and the in-between narration, which I thought over explained things, stated the obvious and even repeated what a character just said.But these details while annoying me greatly seemed to have flown over the heads of the majority of the other readers so maybe it's just me.Bottom line: a decent buy but I'm not sure if I'll buy the sequel yet."
4,Real nice character development!,"Throughout much of the fantasy I read, I often crave a better attachment to the characters. I can enjoy books that don't give me 3-D characters, but I prefer to wind up really thinking about the personalities of the characters; to really get sucked in by the characters beyond the plot. In Left Horse Black, I get character satisfaction. I really enjoyed the way the author ""draws"" her characters. For example, we watch a key character (Tnasha) learn and grow through her flaws in a sincere, yet sometimes humorous way. I was also (pleasantly) surprised to see a proficient, bold soldier shed some tears. I even wound up having some sympathy for the villian, even though I didn't want to. I think that's great character development and I'm looking forward to reading Book II, Warriors Blood Red."
2,Cheap childs halloween mask that looks like a dollar store reject,"The title of the review says it all.Its not one size fits all.Its for a child, and says so on the package.Its also made of foam that wrinkles easily as it arrived with several creases.Its reallt cheap quality and looks like it came from the Dollar Tree, Family dollar, 99cent only, etc"
2,Awful,The mask is very comfortable. That's the only reason I gave it two stars. The mask comes with printing on the bottom of the mask that starts from the left strap and continues all the way to the right one. The raised letters are very noticeable. Also when you get the mask it's flat and the straps make the mask form itself so you end up with the top of the mask being flat which looks nothing like the picture on the website. If you are looking for a mask that looks awful and you don't care about looking realistic this is your mask.
1,Mask very poor,I bought this mask for my granson. He picked this one out for his hollween outfit this year. The mask arrived fast with no problems. This thing broke the frist time he tryed it on very poor item. I would not recomend this item to anyone.
1,Cheap foam,I expected a hard plastic mask and instead it was cheap foam. I returned it. The return process was very easy.
1,Trash,"The quality of this mask was shoddy and the image shown for it does it too much justice. It's a flat, styrofoam piece of junk."
2,GOOD MASK IF YOU HAVE A VERY BIG HEAD,"This mask isnt all that great because it's too flexible. The mesh eye covering fell out of mine the first day. The way the mask is constructed is pretty good, but for it to fit like the picture looks, you would have to have a wide face. My face is slimmer and the mask fits my face but looks like it's bent. It would be like putting the mask over your fist and pushing forward while pulling back on the straps. I recomend a full over your head type mask or just finding the old style hard plactic Jason Mask."
3,Who was Mary?,"Yes, read this book. It has an interesting point of view if your mind is open. Learn new possibilities. I also recommend Agori (Defenders of the Holy Grail) and of course, Starbird for more books on MM!"
1,Rubbish,"I like her other books, but this one was ridiculous. I know there was supposed to be a message behind it, about feminism and Christianity, which could be true. But the rest of it, where is that coming from? It's just like some bargain basement historical romance."
2,Call me crazy but I don't like it,"I keep trying to force myself to play this thing because all I read are rave reviews for it...but I'm not feeling it. First off half of the sound effects are downright ANNOYING (that crying baby Mario makes me reach for the power button every time...couldn't they have thought of something else???). Then there are the controls, which I find much less intuitive than other Mario games--even the way Yoshi jumps is off...it's way too slow. Even if I look past those issues, I still don't find myself having fun while playing this game. Where's the fun??"
2,yoshi's island,"i was disappointed in this game. as i understood it, it was the next game after supermarioworld but it did not compare at all"
1,somethings missing,i bought the game because i like mario games and because of the reviews. but they negleted to mention that you need the turbo controller or gun to play. therefor whats to know about the game. that devise is nowhere to be found. beware friends.
5,A Biographic FANTASY,"One reviewer said to forget the plot: how do we forget what is nonexistent? To call it banal is an understatement. But who cares, this is a showcase for the music of Rodgers & Hart. I'm sure the Ziegfield Follies were never more entertaining. Gene Kelly's ""Slaughter"" alone is worth the price of admission. If you like the music of Rodgers & Hart performed extremely well, then this is a must movie for you. I first saw this movie about 55 years ago and it has remained one of my favorites."
3,Should have been much better,"This movie is entertaining enough, but should have been much better, considering the musical talent at MGM at this time. Why wasn't Frank Sinatra (under MGM contract at the time) not in this movie?Mickey Rooney is very good as Lorenz Hart. Highlights include his duet with Judy Garland and Judy doing a solo, Mel Torme singing Blue Moon, and Gene Kelly and Vera-Ellen tearing it with their dancing on the Slaughter on Tenth Ave number. Lowlights include the Ann Sothern number, and the dreadful June Allyson singing Thou Swell. Sorry fellow critics, this is NOT a ""great"" movie."
5,An MGM Classic Musical,"This dramatized biography of Rodgers and Hart is given the glossy MGM treatment, but is none the worse for it. Rodgers and Hart's music is timeless. There are many great performers in this movie such as Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Gene Kelly, etc. This movie is not a masterpiece, but the music is superb and that elevates the entire movie. Pleasant viewing."
3,Judy is Good,"I loved Judy singing Johnny-One-Note and loved watching her co-star from Meet Me in Saint Louis pretending like he was in love with a girl. Not much else to watch in the movie, however. Tom Drake and Judy should have made another movie together. It would have been fun."
3,Words and Music,"For Hollywood a fairly decent biopic at least better than Night and Day treatment of Cole Porter. It has the great Rodgers and Hart tunes - at least some of them and if they couldn't deal with Laurenz Hart I'm not sure they'd be ready even today. The acting was good the songs terrific, I'd reccomend for any lover of Richard Rodgers musicals."
2,Okay ska,"Ahh,well. I bought Skarmageddon Vol 1 with a great Arsenals song, ""Hypocrite"" on the second disc,and bought this album from my local hippie-dippie Head shop/record store. It's merely okay, passable ska,I recommend using it as a b-side when making a tunes for the road cassette or mixing it in with other ska on a Mp3 collection (buy it first,don't steal music,darn it!!) for a long road trip. Lyrics are corny but fun. You should have this just to complete your Moon Records collection."
4,Read for a good understanding of what Fair Isle knitting is,"If you are a fairly experienced knitter and can create the garment basics (i.e. figure your gauge and cast on accordingly), it is indispensible. If you need a pattern with directions (e.g. cast on x number of stitches on size y needles), this book does not supply that. It gives guidelines for garments, just not full patterns. What it does supply is a fabulous history of this knitting art form, explanations of how it developed and how it was used. Lots of great pictures. The third part of the book is dedicated to patterns in graph form, which is just the way I like it, personally. I've enjoyed browsing through it and putting my creativity to the challenge of creating what I want to make. If it ever gets cold down here in Texas, that vest made of Harris tweed wool will be great. Luckily, I knit for the knitting more than for the finished product."
4,Pretty good read,"Although the ending did not really come as too much of a surprise for me (I had guessed it about halfway through), this thriller remains a well-written piece of work that I kept thinking to myself would work pretty well on screen.Not a bad read at all if you have nothing particularly interesting to do over the weekend."
3,Promising tale of fascinating couple in Regency England.,"Kate returned to her family home in Regency England expecting a chance to relax. Instead she runs the estate neglected by her oldest brother. She also plays highwayman, holding up carriages to find evidence she needs to help her second brother. The arrival of Bly only adds to her considerable stress. Bly has invited himself to the estate to find two old friends. As he searches for clues to their disappearance, he wonders what secrets Kate is hiding. The more he learns about her, the more he wants to shoulder her burdens. The pressure on Kate builds steadily, and despite her strength of character, it is clear that she is reaching her breaking point. Bly is an equally strong character, and they make a fascinating couple. Kate seems a bit slow to catch on after Bly identifies the villain, and the writing is a bit rough at times. However, the story shows great promise, and Christine Kingston will be a talent to watch."
1,The Night the Stars Fell,"I loved the book. It had just the amount of intrigue and romance to keep you interested. This is the first book by Christina Kingston I have read. Would like to know if she is going to continue with the ""Lucky Seven""? I read the book in one day and immediately went to the computer to see if she had any more about this group. If not, I hope she will consider doing them."
3,More or less,"I wouldn't say that the graphics are entirely bad. Riggs and Murtaugh do look strikingly familiar, and some of the backgrounds are fine, but that's just about it. The thugs look like good ol' Nintendo. Difficulty's what makes the game almost impossible to play, unless you're extremely patient. The game has a time limit which confuses the player into playing faster, but when it expires, it only drops your energy. If the player takes enough time handling the thugs without worrying about the time, then he may discover that the game is not as extremely hard as I describe it. It's still hard enough to make you wonder why the graphics aren't so good. It's the worst game you may ever get to play, but it's far from best. I only recommend it if you're a die hard Lethal Weapon's fan."
5,Fantastic! A 6th Star.,"Not often does a remake equal or surpass an original let-alone a classic. French planter (Rade Sherbedgia), and Navy officer (Harry Connick Jr.) and Nellie was brilliantly and vibrantly played by Glenn Close Once again the Reviews done do justice to a remake. I understand Hollywood wants purity, however, they should admit when today's starts are a bit better than yesterdays."
1,What a WASTE of time and money!!,"I agree that this was definitley a vanity project for Glenn Close. OK Nellie is YOUNG, beautiful, naive, cute, a ""green girl from Little Rock"". NONE of these qualities fit Glenn Close! Even the party scene up on the hill was outrageous. She's in a frumpy daytime dress, and I could see was Nellie in her full pink balllgown swirling around. The original had GORGEOUS scenery, this version is only slightly more appealing than a beach in Southern California. The song numbers were flat, Glenn and Emil both had terrible voices which just grated on me. and COME ON...the nurse says to Nellie ""he's gorgeous, those eyes..."" HUH? He's like 65 yrs old and covered in a big bushy beard! Give me a break! This movie was so awful it was insulting!!"
4,Classic,"This movie musical was good, singing was great. I thought worst part was Glen Close's acting. Her singing was okay, especially Honey Bun (where she played the man). I did believe the French planter was in love with her, although one couldn't imagine why, but I didn't believe she was in love with him. She was in love with Harry Connic whose voice is definately lovable. The technical quaility was fine."
4,A error gone good!,"I had joined Netflix and wanted to see (the 1958 version of) South Pacific as I am soon to participate in the pit orchestra of a local community theater. Lo and behold, when I opened the Netflix package, they had sent the 2001 version instead. Only having seen the ""original"", I was pleasantly surprised by Glenn Close's version, and VERY impressed with the four main characters (Glenn Close, Harry Connick Jr., Rade Sherbedgia and [can't remember his name, but Murphy Brown's painter]. Thought they were all a vast improvement from the 1958 movie. Conversely, Juanita Hall and Ray Walston were much better in their respective parts in the 1958 film.Would love to see Rade Sherbedgia in other roles, as he just oozes sensuality and had this writer's attention in every scene in which he appeared!"
4,Great!!,"It was very good. I liked the cuts, they made it much more enjoyable of me, as being a kid. I love Gleen Close and South Pacific! So the natural thing to get was this. Gleen Close seemed a little old but a nice match with Rade Sherbedgia! he was okay, I like the song ""Some Enchanted Evening"" sung by a baritone much better, but he is still very good. All in all, a very good movie."
1,Most of the actors gave horrid performances AND cannot sing.,"This movie might have been alright if they would had found more stars who could sing really well, and didn't mess with the melodies and orchestrations so much. But it is NOT possible to improve on the original Rogers & Hammerstein orchestrations, and this movie, while not unwatchable, is hideous, yes truly painful to the ears!! Seriously, every song is messed up in some way, and there are even some very nice parts of songs completely cut out. Even with the wonderful Harry Connick Jr. cannot save this pointless remake.Even the sound is bad. It's muffled and hissy!! Good grief!!!!Save your money. If you've got to see what this mess looks like, try watching it when it's on TV."
2,NOT THE ORIGINAL!!!,"HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED, I would not have ordered if I had known it was not the original movie. Parts were missing that I wanted to see & hear. I had planned on a presentation using the song ""You've go to be carefully taught."" Also the ""Happy Talk"" was not in this movie at all."
2,Modification O.K. music appalling,"Screenwriter's license allows for some deviation forms the original. I have to admit I like the original movie much better. For that mater the musical was better. However it is everyone's right to try something different. Who knows until you try? However there is no excuse for the unprofessional singing and there was more missing than they said there would be. (See my review of the soundtrack that they actually are trying to sell).Now trying not to compare the 1956 movie, this rendition is still stilted and unprofessional. The actors do not fit the characters they play. And the storyline is much harder to follow. I can understand trying something different. But who thought that it would sell?"
1,Disappointing,"""South Pacific"" is one of my favorite musicals, but this version stinks like a week-old fish. I know Glenn Close produced this as a starring vehicle for herself, but somebody should have warned her that casting herself as the naive, small-town nurse Nellie Forbush was ludricous. And the whole Lt. Cable subplot gave me the creeps. Bloody Mary introduces him to her teenage daughter and stands there beaming while the kid strips off her robe 5 seconds later. Having him sing ""Younger than Springtime"" while they're in bed together just killed the romance for me.The '50's version with Mitzi Gaynor might not be a masterpiece, but it's a lot better than this piece of trash."
1,Rodgers & Hammerstein's South Pacifice 2001,"This has got to be the worst remake of a classic motion picture in history. Most of the characters are not believable and most cannot sing. For a 50+ year old woman to try and play a 20 year old is a stretch and Glen Close did not come close. The picture dragged and seemed out of step with the original play and movie. There were only two bright spots in the whole movie, Billis and Ensign Cable. I would not place this picture in my collection if it was given to me."
1,Woops!,"This was, to say the least, a very disappointing remake of a fabulous musical. It captures none of the vivacity or breathtaking beauty and terrible sadness of the time period (WWII, Pacific) that the previous edition mastered to perfection. It was a Woops! sort of production."
2,For South Pacific Completists Only,"On the plus side, this movie has pretty good production values and the cinematography is more than adequate, i.e., it looks pretty good. On the other hand, the acting is pretty wooden; the singing, even Harry Connick, is completely forgettable and the big music set pieces, in particular, "" There is Nothing Like a Dame"" are flat, flat, flat. Annoying faults in a musical production. The biggest problem though is casting Glenn Close as Ensign Forbush...she would have been more properly cast as Nellie's mother, she's just too old for the part, and it is really distracting...don't get me wrong, I'm no spring chicken myself, but I don't pretend to be a boy band member, either....The 1958 version is far supereior, even taking into account the somewhat bizarre ""single hue toning"" cinematography...better yet, get a copy of the 1949 OBC recording and play it while you read Michener's book...for South Pacific completists only"
4,"""South Pacific"" Reimagined","This made for TV movie is an imaginative and entertaining retelling of the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical set on fictional islands in the South Pacific during WWII. Interpreting the story using more modern sensibilities, it directly and boldly addresses the interracial conflicts and prejudices that are central to the narrative. This expanded version also includes additional scenes derived, as were those in the original version, from James Michener's short story collection, ""Tales of the South Pacific."" They serve to heighten the suspense as the story builds to its climax. The acting, singing and dancing are all excellent, the cinematography is spectacular and Glen Close does a pretty good job of making the viewer forget that she is considerably older than Nelly Forbush, the central character. I do not hesitate to recommend this DVD."
4,A Must See for Rade Serbedzija fans!!!,"I really enjoyed this movie. I did not see the original screen version, there-fore I can judge this version on it's own merrits. The main characters are all very good. Glenn Close is such a wonderful actress. Her singing voice is not the strongest, but you have to give her credit for her sincerity.My favorite part of this movie is listening to Rade Serbedzija sing. He has a beautiful, dreamy voice. It is probably not the most comfortable thing, to sing in a language that is not your mother tongue. I believe that he was born in the former Yugoslavia, and in this movie he sings in English and in French! I am glad that he did not put on a phony French accent to play this Frenchman. His own accent did just fine.When you watch this movie, just remember that it is a musical!Just enjoy it. Also the scenery is breath-taking."
1,"ZERO! If the rating existed, I'd give it -10 (MINUS TEN).","Ahem! I suspect anyone who gave this a good--or even a mediocre--review intended to bang the drum for the ORIGINAL (entertaining! well-cast!) production. This one doesn't deserve the Rodgers & Hammerstein association. Spend your money on ANYTHING else, but don't subject yourself to Glenn Close, Harry Connick Jr., and the rest of this ludicrous production. Hang up your hat, Glenn. I realize there's no business like show business, but have a heart."
5,The DVD is perfect,"I have seen the dvd today. This is one fine production. I agree with the other 5 star reviews and add that it has been quite some time since I have enjoyed television this much. It is about as perfect as I could imagine, now that the commercials are gone and the picture is flawless. This South Pacific is serious, extremely well acted, sincere, beautiful, humane and real. All the lead acting is perfect, especially Glen Close. I loved Bloody Mary. This important movie is a treasure. If you have seen it and did not like it, remind me not to listen to you again."
2,How Sad,This remake was a disaster. A wonderful musical in the original that was remade into a plodding and dull film that lacks energy. I love Glenn Close--but this is a bomb.
5,great movie,"this is an awesome, entertaining musical that has your tapping your feet and singing along if you know the words to the songs."
3,Movie,"This movie is ok, shortened but still enjoyable. I prefer the original movie or the new Broadway play!"
1,Worst remake in history,Glenn close as Nellie Forbush seems like her self-prescribed antidote to the deranged Fatal Attraction character Alex. It has to be the worst remake of a classic film in history.
4,I embrace Glenn!,"Sometimes a classic can just be sinfully fun with a fresh coat of paint...and that is exactly what Ms. Close has brought us.This somewhat flawed original story - is easily overlooked considering the lush photography and beautifully recorded score. A great DVD feature is a fun ""home video"" look at Glenn's producing the project on location - artfully crafted to really help us understand the passion and commitment this fine cast made to re-producing this film.I can't wash this film out of my mind!"
3,its time has passed,the film itself is good i have nothing against the cast mr connick is perfectly suited for his role. but if i had to purchase a version of this it would have to be with enzio penza and thats just because hes in it . now getting to the title . its high time broadway starts getting some new music instead of grabbing onto these old chestnuts every time there in financial need pardon the old i mean nothing by it this form of music by in large are masterpeices i mean that soulheartedly and if had to decide between this or rent id pick south pacific any day of the week but please not right now give it a rest.
1,The Pacific Pits!,"If I could have given this hideous, zero-talented remake of the old musical, ""South Pacific,"" zero stars, I would do so. It's unbelievable that this remake was even aired on TV. Harry Connick Jr. is terrific and he shines in every scene. But 56-year-old Glenn Close is like a grandmother who overstayed her welcome and when she prances around while singing ""I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out of My Hair"", you simply have to close your eyes and groan. If possible, the worst performance was the creature who portrayed Bloody Mary. She was like some filfthy work horse they dragged in from the streets. Covered with dust and dirt, her teeth green, she sounded like a shrieking frog. Drab photography, zero production values makes you want to rush out and buy the l956 movie production that looks like ""Gone With the Wind"" compared to this embarassing, wretched remake."
1,harry connick jnr-actor? PLEEEEEASE,"Reviewers who,like me,do lot care for this version still show reverence for Connick's performance.OK let me say it-He can't act-he's more wooden than wood and don't get me started on Emile.Glen maybe 30 years too old for Nellie-but she gives it a fair shake,but Billis and Bloody mary are scarily bad."
1,South Horrific,"Wow Hollywood, what a great idea. Let's have Glenn Close, who looks no younger than 60, star as the young, naive nurse, Nellie Forbush, who was played delectably by Mitzi Gaynor in the original film. The cast just gets worse and worse - aw, geeze, what a piece of crap this TV remake was from beginning to end."
3,Glad I rented instead of buying,"The songs are out of order, Glenn Close is CLEARLY too old for the role of Nellie Forbush, the direction is uninspired, and Robert Pastorelli fails to take full advantage of comic aspects of the Luther Billis character.But the scenery looks nice.""There is Nothing Like A Dame"" is cheapened by re-assigning some vocal parts and having the sailors sing to camera. Singing to camera should be used very sparingly, if at all. When used too much it reeks of amateurism and lack of proper musical staging.But the scenery looks nice."
2,Bad Wording,This books talks about the polite West Manor peas and the rude beans from the south. It just doesn't sit right with me. I wouldn't read it to my child. It could have been accidental but it seems like a classist and racist innuendo.
1,Racist?,"Honestly, what kind of message is this for young minds?There's a homogenous group of people that live on the 'other side of the tracks', who a) all look different, b)are uniformly all rude, and c)steal from each other, and in the end they can't provide for themselves. They're generally 'bad' people, with no exceptions, whereas all the pea folk are all good.This is ridiculous, and in my opinion potentially feeds into rascist 'us and them' mentalities. This is not what our society needs, despite whatever superficial benefits might come from teaching kids to say please and thank you. Are these good Christian lessons?"
2,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed after reading through this very small book. It is only a few pages long and not at all interesting. I am new to VeggieTales and hope this is not a representation of other books. I will say the illustrations are great, but the content is lacking."
5,great book,i love this book! its incredibly illustrated. its bright and the characters' expressions are very animated. it teaches a lesson and entertains simultaneously. its short enough for little ones and just long enough to be worth the read for older kids.
4,WORTH IT,MY SON ENJOYS THIS BOOK. ALTHOUGH HE STILL REFUSES TO SAY PLEASE AND THANK YOU (HE'S ONLY ONE YEAR OLD) ITS ONE OF HIS BED TIME FAVORITES
1,Avoid These,These are awful. Don't buy these unless you want to wind up peeing into your shoe. The cap at the end of the bag simply snaps on to the drain valve and doesn't stay on. Order the bags with T-tap valves instead.
5,Perfect for my desk!,"For over 20 years, I have been given this desk calendar at work. Due to budget restraints, I bought it, myself. It is a useful tool!"
4,Biblical structuralism,"Patte has developed a personalised interpretation of Greimas' works which is valuable to those interested in structuralism and its application to the Bible.Patte depends on placing heavier emphases on Greimas' understanding of actants that are manifestly true to the reader than anyone else who uses Greimas' methods. Greimas would have had no problem with Patte's approach. He was frequently happy to watch the impact his methodology would make in the area of biblical studies.Several of Patte's publications are important to biblical structuralism, not least because I would content that Patte has created an important branch of biblical structuralism. Although he is methodical himself, Patte is heavy going! But that is in the nature of Greimas' works!"
3,DREAMLAND LAKE,DREAM LAND Lake by Richard Peck is a really good book. This is a mystery novel. It's about a mystery man who was found in the woods. Bryan and flip the two main characters of the book.TRY TO FIND OUT WHO IT IS.THE MURDERER USES ALL DIFFRIENT CLUES TRYING TO TROW THEM OFF. THEY DON'T WANT TO TELL THE L.A.P.D. SO THEY KEEP TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO IT IS.
4,Pretty good,"I bought this CD for one song and one song only, The Gangbusters ""Bad Attitude"" (which Unsteady has covered on a few comps.) It brings back many highschool memories. If you like ska that song has a great beat, and it's fun to sing & dance too. There are a few other good songs as well, but I wouldn't say it's the best collection of tracks on one disc. Other notable tracks are Hepcat, Skankin Pickle, and Upbeats. For me ""Bad Attitude"" gets 5 stars, and the rest of the disc gets 3."
3,Not too shabby,"The album's ok. Dance Hall Crashers are always great. And Skankin' Pickle makes fun music. The LGB track is snazzy. And, there's an early No Doubt track that serious fans will want. Overall, an ok comp album."
1,i got ripped off,This claims to be Beckwith's commentary on the Kumulipo. The book I got did not have her commentary or the original text which Amazon claims it does. Rip Off.......And apparently I don't have a way to get my money back...false advertising....
3,Shock and awe in Iraq.,"This is a picture book on the war that toppled Saddam from his dictatorship. As one of the previous reviewers have already noted, it is a coffee table book. The pictures are great as they show the reality of war--innocent civilians including children being wounded and killed. Not surprisely, I found the book to be pro war and anti Saddam. The period detailed was the initial invasion and the aftermath. People were generally pro-American and welcomed the Americans, and this shows in the pictures of U.S. soldiers being kissed. Much has changed since this book has been published. At present, it does not demonstrate the true feeling of Iraqis or Americans about the war now.There is not much to read in this book. There are a few slivers of info, but overall a person will not gain any great insight into why the war was fought. The pictures are great, and this would be the only reason to purchase the book."
3,"Not pretty, somewhat delusional...","This coffeetable book contains graphic images of the Iraq war.Its visually engaging, I will give it credit for that.Its also a clear warning to any country that would like tothreaten the USA.Where it goes wrong is that it paints an overly rosy picture of the aftermath of the war. This is war the way Bush the Junior and Rumsfeld would like you to see it. The book shows grateful Iraqis hugging and kissing US soldiers. I think we know by now that not everybody in Iraq is that happy to see us there and we face a potential Vietnam-like quagmire unless we can assemble a coalition of nations to secure and pacify Iraq.The book graphically shows the results of Saddam's megalomania and his total disregard for his own people. Too bad we only have to look to North Korea to find another despot all too eager to throw his own people ""under the bus""."
1,Poor!,Do not purchase this product it start over heating and fried the amp. Let me remind you it is winter and still fried. Go out to your local audio store and purchase an amp there then you could return it without a ups fee.
5,The Way of Qigong: The Art and Science of Chinese Energy Healing,"Ken Cohen's book is a very complete and illustrative book on thesubject. I would almost put it in the category of a college text book on the subject of Qigong. He is as qualified to write and teach about the subject as anyone out there. A must for anyone's reference library on Qigong. It is an important work that will stand the test of time. I had read a library copy, bought a copy in the past and gave it away. This copy is, again, for my own my reference collection."
3,The Way of Qigong: The Art and Science of---by Ken Cohen,"Excellent--but a BIG book. It's great if you are looking for a scholarly work. No photos of poses though, just somewhat crude drawings. KEN COHEN'S ""QIGONG"" CD, however, IS WONDERFUL! And it comes with a tiny booklet that provided me with all the info I needed. I did already have the Deborah Davis book and CD set (""Women's Qigong for Health and Longevity""). It IS TERRIFIC! BOOK IS GREAT. (And it is not just for women; plenty of good info for all.)"
5,"If you only buy one Qigong book, make it this one","This is a very well written qigong book, packed with information and for a meager price. Ken Cohen's writing style is enjoyable, and there is so much information in this book that I find myself picking it up from time to time to re-read parts of it. Very well done. The only negative I can think of is that it would've been nice to have some meridian/accupoint charts included in the text."
5,The Way of Qigong,"As a licensed practitioner of acupuncture and Oriental medicine, I often recommend qigong to my patients as a healing therapy. Ken Cohen's ""The Way of Qigong"" is by far the best introductory work on the subject I have read thus far. In fact, it is in many ways much more than merely an introduction to qigong, since Cohen delves wonderfully into much of the philosophy underlying qigong in a fashion which is more literary and in some ways more comprehensive than even more advanced texts. He is able to articulate the nature of qigong to those unfamiliar with the art. The book provides good background information on many topics, such as research, from which even advanced practitioners would benefit. I highly recommend this book to my patients."
5,Sensetive treatement,"A sensitive and comprehensive treatment of Chi Gung that describes the full depth and breadth of the energy science as it applies in a holistic context. This is not a Betty Crocker how-to recipie for learning a lifelong path in three easy lessons. If you want to o deep and understand the underlying principles of energy science from one who has truly explored it in his sincere apprentice, research and practice, you can't do better than Cohen's book."
5,The Way of Qigong: The Art and Science of Chinese Energy Healing,"This book includes a lot of personal research done by the author and chronicles his experiences and travels with different teachers, not only of Qigong, but also of Tai Chi, chinese medicine and martial arts. Some of the histories are ""somewhat fantastic and unbelievable,"" yet many things were previously ""unknown."" It is worth purchasing this book and keeping it for a lifetime."
5,Exceptional learning experience for all beginner's.,"Ken Cohen is an exceptional writer. This book should be picked up by all beginner's! This book ALMOST covers every different area on QiGong. He doesn't limit the reader's mind to one view, listing substantial documentation for the reader to follow up on. He doesn't show any of the Meridians, which the beginner should not have, until they've properly developed the foundation of QiGong. Waiting for a follow-on to this developing experience!"
3,husband uses,"WE HAVE ONLY HAD THE BOOK FOR A MONTH GOT IT ON AUG, 2012. My husband has anxiey real bad and grinds his teeth in the middle of the night, where he has actually broke them. His patience is non exictand, with doing the things he once loved. He has a pelvice injury that prevents him from doing a lot of things that he once did. So I know this is 50% of the problem. Then I was kicked in the head by a horse and have very bad days.I have noticed that he is not grinding his teeth as much. In the night I will say breath wright and his face will evenchang look more relaxed and words can not say. When we are out he will say ""Oh not breathing correctly"" and start breathing. On his bad pain days he will sit and do his breathing. He seems not to grind his teeth, sleeping better, and his patience has even got a little better."
5,A shell collector's guide,"I just love this book. It lists so many beautiful seashells with very beautifully detailed photographs. The seashells are shown close up as if they have been cut out from photographs and pasted onto the page. You can imagine if you placed a real seashell right onto the page. That's how it looks. For each shell, it describes it's appearance, growth size, location, habitat, and of course-its name! A truly wonderful book for any collector (serious or beginner) to take along to the beach. It's a very informative and helpful field guide. A very good size to take anywhere. Might fit in a large pocket or easily in a purse, or your beach bag. I used to rent this book from my local library because I loved it so much. Now I purchased it through amazon used, in a ""NEW"" condition for a great price. It is worth it if you love shells as much as me!-Rehana(Chicago, IL)"
2,Asian shells,Don't buy this book (Smithsonian?--US?) unless you are interested in shells of SE Asia.
2,Spotty coverage,"Although this book has many beautiful pictures and drawings, it is extremely limited in the numbers of shells it discusses or portrays. I was looking for an authoritative guide and key, but it is instead a miniature coffee-table book. Arrived on time and in pristine condition."
3,Alright text nothing exciting.,"I have read many well written and well organized texts about geology, this is not one of them. The language is so dry, and information is scattered."
2,Not a book to learn from,"I am a geology student and I did not find this book sensitive to that. Every sentence packed into this book (there are a lot) was important. There was no glossary, chapter review, chapter objectives, or any user friendly thing to help a student really learn the subject. I do not recommend this book unless you already are a geomorphologist, then it may not be so terrible."
5,This gets the job done,"This is my second one of these. We use it everyday & it does a good job.Just don't fill it up and then jump on it, that's why this is my second one.It does what you would buy it for."
5,Favorite kitchen gadget,"I love this thing! I have had one for a year, and am now giving it as gifts to many people. I chop onions, carrots, potatoes, sweet potatoes,celery, peppers, etc. I use the smaller blade for hard boiled eggs, strawberries to go over our oatmeal, olives, mushrooms, anything you would take the time to dice this thing does in seconds. You do have to push with 2 hands when doing something hard like carrots or potatoes. (one hand in the middle and one on the end) I will buy this again in an instant if mine breaks!"
5,Great eco-friendly gadget!,"Definitely beats doing it by hand with cutting board and knife! Highly recommended for environement-sensitive people who want to save time in the kitchen without relying on electronic gadgets! My husband used it with onion and although it required some strength on his part, he still loved it! I used it today with cucumbers and it was so effortless and well diced! Definitely better cut and shorter than if I had done it by hand! I am going to recommend this to family and friends and give as a gift whenever I get the chance!!"
2,pre-preparation makes it just ordinary,"I have tried it with all veggies.Trust me the amount of pre preparation required in cutting them into slices and amount of force required to push the lever down.,makes it useless......I might as well dice them myself!"
4,Vidalia Chop Wizard,Vidalia Chop Wizard was the second one I purchased. Saves alot of time and dices vegetables well.You do have to take care to pre-slice any larger vegetables as they won't fit through the screen. Don't try to force as there are plastic tabs as the leverage poiny that could fracture if your noy careful. Purchased a vege-brush to clean yhe fine grate screen.
2,Not Worth the $$,"I bought this because I was cooking a huge amount of chili for a charity event and needed to chop several onions. For that one event it was perfect - I chopped several onions and tomatoes in a fraction of the time it would have taken by hand. However, in the long run, this gadget proved to be difficult to keep clean, especially when you're chopping onions. The top of the device is easy to clean with the little cleaner that you get (or a fork), but the actual blades are trickier. The fine skin of the onion can get stuck to the blades and it takes some real effort to get them clean. Also, the commercials for this are a little deceptive, as it takes some real muscle to push the top down to chop the veggies - you'll need to quarter them at least before adding them to the chopper. For $20, I expected something a little easier to use and maintain."
3,LOVED IT UNTIL.....,Add me to the long list of people who loved this chopper until the hinge snaps. Yeah you need to give it a good bit of pressure but the results are fantastic - especially if (like me) you cry when chopping onions. Now I'm crying because my new toy is broken.Hey - an idea for the manufacturer... how bout making a metal frame that's designed to take the pressure on the hinge. I'd gladly pay 5 times the price for a more reliable version of this.Bummer. :-(
5,Love it!,"I love this, I've bought this for a few friends and family, everyone loves it! The two sizes are great for chopping just about any veggie!"
1,NOT safe for dishwasher,"I like to put everything in the dishwasher for sanitation and convenience. While I bought this believing it was safe for the dishwasher, it isn't. After only about 3-4 uses (but too late to return it), a piece of the top broke off while in the top rack of the dishwasher. My husband tried to superglue it but it wouldn't work. It worked well up to then but I had to throw it in the trash because it's totally useless now. Save your money -- or hand-wash it. And, be prepared for very small pieces -- they were a little too small for fruit salad -- it becomes more like fruit stew."
1,Vidalia Chop Wizard,The first item we tried to chop was tomatoes. The hinge broke chopping tomatoes! The item was replaced for free. We tried to use it on tomatoes again and you guessed it. The hinge broke again.
1,Zero customer care,The pegs that hold the top on to the bottom just crack off and the company that makes these (for <$2 each) won't respond to requests for customer care.These things are helpful from time to time but they break from normal use quite easily. I never used anything other than tomatoes and onions in mine.
4,Pretty Good,I am pleased with my purchase. Its noisy but saves time when having to shop a lot of foods. I wish it came with a recipe book though.
3,Vidalia chop wizard review,The product is good except for the fact that you have to apply too much pressure to chop some foods.The blades could be a bit sharper.
4,Fabulous tool,"I am so happy with this item. I bought it about a month ago and have used it regularly. It is wonderful! when I first got it, I had a bit of trouble with it - it seemed to lock open and not do much of anything. But a little fiddling with it and it is so helpful. I no longer cry when chopping onions. It is a tiny bit of a pain to clean, but not enough to make me not use it. I get fabulously uniform dices in both sizes. Yes, it is plastic and maybe it is flimsy but it saves me so much time and discomfort - when it breaks, I will happily buy another. Really, a great product."
3,Great Idea with a BIG Flaw,"After one year of use, the hinge broke off. It worked well if the pieces were cut up in large pieces, but did take a bit of pressure to make it work. If it had not broken, I would have rated it 5 stars."
5,A Fun Chopper,"This Chop Wizard is great--and lots of fun to use. This chops and dices quickly and can be used anywhere--no plug ins. It's also great for getting rid of frustration, etc--just give the top a few good whacks each time you chop or dice and in no time you're feeling better!!"
4,Chopper,"It wasn't so easy for me to push it down like they show on TV; I really had to put some muscle in it - but, it did it and the choppings were uniform. Easy clean up. Maybe I need to work out?? haha Well made product, but it DID require a little muscle."
4,Best onion chopper I've ever owned,"The is the best onion/vegetable chopper I've ever owned. I use it for both onions and zucchini. Having two different sized blades is a great feature. My only complaint: Since I don't have a dishwasher, this item is sometimes a pain to clean - it's hard to get all the little pieces of onion skin off the blade and lid."
1,not a strong product,I bought this chopper a month ago.Last week I was just chopping the carrot and it broke from the corner and is of no use now.I made a wrong choice. I don't suggest anyone to buy this product.
1,"Very Difficult to use, Not Worth it","I thought this would be wonderful as I am a very slow chopper and this could save me A LOT of time, however, you have to chop the veggies in very small pieces just to be able to get them through. Once you've done that without getting it jammed and calling your husband over to force it though you then have the lovely task of cleaning it. The small piece that they provide is basically useless. I have since purchased the Veggie Chopper from Williams Sonoma and could not be happier!"
3,Good for soft vegetables,Great to shop onions and peppers. But forget on carrots and the likes (unless cooked). The clean up is a chore.
2,onions,this was recommended by a friend so i purchased it. easy to take apart and put back together again. hard to push to get the onions through. almost too much trouble to use. then there is the cleaning. sometimes very hard to get those little bits off
5,Vidalia Chop Wizard,"Excellent product. I ordered it after fracturing my left wrist. The wizard made it possible for me to chop vegetables with one hand with great ease. It is wonderful, especially, for chopping onions. The cleaning tool that comes with it is very effective. The product is easy to clean and is dishwasher safe."
5,LOVE this!,This is my second one of these. I used my other one so much I finally broke it! The shipping was on time and everything was as expected of the product. Thank you!
2,"Alas, if only it was better made!","We loved this wonderful little gadget, worked like a charm till the plastic base hinges broke off after only 5 months of use. We were easy on it, too, because I was suspect of plastic taking such hard use so it only went through the dishwasher 3 times(it states it is dishwasher safe) and we partially cooked potatos and carrots in the microwave before putting them through. We miss it - I looked for replacement trays but they do not make them. It is just not okay to have to buy another and throw this in the landfill. We are back to hand chopping."
3,Cheaply Made but Very Handy,"Let me start out by saying I love this product. It is so handy when you have to cut up a lot of vegetables for a recipe. That being said, it breaks a lot. The first one I bought; on the first use the side of the container that holds the chopped food broke off. It was a large piece including the knob that the lid pivots on. It still worked, it was just hard to push the lid down to get the food actually chopped. The second one, the knob on the side just broke off without even being used. This one also still works. It should be a measure of how much I love this tool that I absolutely still use this product. It is very handy. It is just not made very well."
2,Danger danger danger,"It looks like nothing more than a cell phone. Say, one day you're doing food prep and testing the parameters of reality when you feel a need to accept a free-floating vibe coming over the aether. You pick this up, it's large cell phone shape denoting the importance of the incoming groove, and you chop the side of your face. Bring down! A sudden field of cross-hatched wounds gout blood and everyone goes home after maybe putting a compress on your suppurating injury."
2,Didn't work for me,"This thing was a pain to use. I bought average sized onions. It couldn't cut through them. It made mush of the first few layers of it. It did dice a baby carrot well. If I need to cut things the size of a baby carrot to use this, then really it's not worth the time. It was not easy to clean. The little rake made cleaning the top piece easier, but it was very difficult for me to clean the blade. I am returning mine and will just use a knife."
2,not so good,I bought Vidalia vegetable chopper wizard yesterdayand the only vegetables that I could cut were potatoesand carrots. It is not good for onions and eggplant.The fine blades work well but the large blades are ofno use.
3,Not so easy clean up...,"Of course everything seen on TV is a snap to clean up, then you actually use the product. Chopping the items does require some muscle! I did enjoy the square hash browns this unit produced, but having the food get stuck and then having to clean out corners after every chop was a hassle!! Yes, I did follow the directions... I am going to stick with my kitchen knives, if you want something done right, ..."
3,Liked to being disappointed!,"I've had my Vidalia Onion Chopper for a few years now -- we loved it. We use it all the time. Careful, over time the plastic that holds the lid that you push down cracked and flew off. It flew off and hit me in the eye. Thank goodness I happened to have my head in the right position, it nailed the corner of my eye. Eye turned black and blue. If they only came in a metal version."
5,Chop Wizard,Purchased this for my stepmom who hates to cut onions. She loves the chop wizard and uses it often.
4,A time saver,"It does a great job of chopping veggies in perfect squares and the best part of it is that its definitely a time saver.Worst part is getting the left over pieces of veggies off which are stuck on the grid ... but there is a little fork like instrument that comes with this product to help you with that.Great for Russian salads like olivye, which require alot of the veggies to be diced."
2,I was a bit disappointed not as good as it looked on TV,"Harder to work than it looked on TV, I thought it had more uses, and am a bit disappointedm with the whole thing"
3,"Good concept, but some design / build issues!","Onions, green beans, all kinds of peppers, even tomatoes [the cut has to be very fast] ... just works! Only one con --- cleaning the top white part can be a royal pain!UPDATE: The hinge on the container [the bottom piece] BROKE within 15 days of usage. I should have heeded the other reviews!"
5,Best Kitchen tool Ever!,"How could I have lived without it? This is definitely the best kitchen tool ever invented in the arena of chopping food! I actually enjoy cooking 100% more, now that it takes only seconds (literally) to chop the necessary food I need. Love, Love, Love it!"
4,Love it! Use it all the time! Keep breaking it!,"I love the Vidalia Chop Wizard and use it all the time. Unfortunately I've broken 2 of them by putting too much pressure on it and breaking the little nobs that hold the top to the clear plastic base. (I have been known to stand on it). You do have to be careful that the food you are chopping is completely within the chopping blade area. But other than that, it's awesome. I'm back on Amazon to buy another.I wish they would make the blades a little sharper so that so much pressured didn't need to be applied. But other than that, It's the one kitchen tool I can't live without."
2,Charges a restock fee if you send it back...beware,The product works ok but seemed a bit too hard to clean for anything that was even a little softer than an onion. My mother couldn't put enough pressure on it to get it to work so I wanted to send it back. It would have cost me $7 mailing fee plus a restocking fee so I just decided to keep it so now it will probably clutter up my kitchen until I can find a home for it. A friend had one and used it extensively to prepare food for her son when he was 1-2 years old and she loved it. I just don't chop enough to want to clean it.
4,Great gift!,Vidalia Chop WizardI purchased a Chop Wizard for my daughter as one of her birthday gifts. She had been home for Christmas and saw mine. I love this product and she loves hers. All things considered it is actually faster than a food processor and is dishwasher safe. Hers arrived quickly (way before her birthday)and was in perfect condition. I will probably purchase this again when I need a gift for family/friend who love the kitchen.
2,Worked for a month and then broke at the hinges.,"It is not as easy as shown in those commercials, but I was able to use it well on small size potatoes, mushrooms, quartered onions, bell peppers for a month. Even with regular use, no abuse what so ever, it broke within a month.I'm about to try the progressive vegetable chopper, hope it will last a while."
5,"Love, love, love it!","I have had mine for a few years. I purchased 6 during the holidays. I wanted to share with my friends how convienent this gadget really is.This has made my kitchen chopping time cut in half or more. It is easy to clean, just take care of it. You should not be too rough with it. I would not put in the dishwasher. At least not the clear lid. It will melt. I learned that mistake. Will never be without one again."
1,Horrible P.O.S.,"This item was given to me as a gift. I hope my DIL doesn't think my review equates with being ungrateful. Tonight both plastic ears sheared off the base as I tried to cut a slice of onion. Good conception, poor product ideation and material realization. So I will salvage the cutters, base and top and see if I can turn my engineering skills to jury-rigging some sort of press since the uniform dice of those onions is really great.I came back to edit this review when my temper was cooler this A.M."
4,Vidalia Chop Wizard,"Great chopper. Only a little big, but does the job. And, easy to clean. The larger size chopper seems better than the small one."
5,Love it!!!!!,"I ordered this item to keep at my boyfriends apt. because he never has any sharp knives and I cook alot. I ended up stealing it and taking it home it worked so well. I chop carrots, onions, celery, potatoes, and everything comes out perfect and the same shape. LOVE IT!!!!"
4,"Love, love, love this gadget, BUT.....","mine broke at the hinge! I don't know if I had too big of a hunk in there or if it was defective to begin with, but it broke. Otherwise, this is a great little gadget, saves lots of time. I especially like that it has the two different sized dicers. Before mine broke I used it almost every day for all sorts of fruits and veggies other than just onions. I guess I will take a chance and order another one and hopefully it will hold up."
4,Use it for what it's made for,"I've been using this tool for 5 years, and it finally broke as described many times above, at the hinge. However, for those concerned about the tool's inability to chop a whole onion at once... come on, people; you saw that on an infomercial. I bought this because I lost an arm in an accident and the one I have left was badly broken, so my dexterity is lacking. This tool is perfect for non-fibrous vegetables; that is, don't try to chop ginger root with it, but peppers and onions do well.Yes, it can take a little force to push a larger vegetable through the grid. So, lean on it. I've actually put mine on the floor and stepped on it to force a potato through the blades, and I EXPECTED it to break. It didn't.This isn't a magical device. If you don't know how to use a knife safely, then this won't solve that problem. But if your dexterity is a little impaired by, say, arthritis or other condition, this will do the job."
2,It Broke....,"My Husband and I bought this item at Macy's. When we saw it, it looked like a really great idea, and the people at the store said ""Oh! Your going to love this!"" We got it home and used it the first time, and I admit you have to use A LOT of pressure to push it down, but it worked. Then, the second time my husband used it, the hindge on it broke....If the blades were sharper, then it would probably work. Plus, it's a pain to clean."
2,last a couple of months before cracking,"My first one lasted a couple of months after the pressure of chopping onions caused the plastic at the hinge to crack. Bought another one thinking it was just my technique of chopping and would cut the onion in to smaller pieces. Did not help - after a few months the same thing happened where the plasic hinge area cracked. Chopping onion needs a bit of force to get the lid down - not for the weak, though I had no problems until the units broke.UPDATE (NOV 9 '09): Bought another one about a month ago. Am cutting the vegetables up smaller than before and bought it from a store that has an easy return/exchange policy and am relying on that as the thing is useful. I can make Israeli salad in no time with this."
3,Helpful but not magical,"It works best with softer fruit/vegetables e.g apples go through smoothly but forget potatoes....I had to chop them by hand as the gadget would not do it...seems like it requires humongous pressure which was beyond my capablities. If you have lots of soft stuff to chop, this works great but if not its better to chop it yourself to avoid the hassle of cutting it into smaller pieces before pressing on the gadget and the cleanup afterwards."
1,don't waste your money,"This looked so good on tv, so easy to use, that I bought it thinking it would be easier on my arthritic hands. When I tried to use it, it smashed the tomatoes and absolutely would not work on a half of a vadaila onion. I had to cut the onions in inch thick sections to get it to work on onions. The only good thing about this item were the 3 lidded containers that came with it. I threw it in the trash."
1,I just threw it away,"The vadalia chop wizard is awesome for about 30 minutes. Then it is not so cool. The clear plastic container can crack from the force of chopping the vegetables. Also, the green dicing plates are very hard to clean. Mine became covered in mold and I had to throw away the entire unit. I really wanted this item to work well. I am quite disappointed."
2,Cheap Plastic!,"I bought this almost a year ago. At first it worked nicely for my boyfriend to use, but when I had to use it (5'1"" and 110 lbs), I had to try my hardest to put all my weight on the top to try and push the food through the plate. Very annoying and hard to do! Also, after multiple uses, the whole plastic container broke and plastic pieces was mixed in the food after trying to put all your weight to crush the food in it."
2,Love - Hate,"I have just ordered my 3rd Vidalia Chop wizard.I have a love hate feeling about this little gem.The idea is great, the application leaves much to be desired.The problem is if you use the small blade frequently, oneof the small ""tits"" on the base is going to break off(hence my third order).This time I also ordered the slicer.Both these units are small and light butthe freight charge was $19.85.This seems a little excessive.When these units break, I think I will look fora different product."
3,"An ok product, but be aware of limitations","We had one of these for almost a year. It's perfect for things like chopping up hard-boiled eggs or other soft foods. For anything harder than that? Not so much. We tried using it for making frenchfries out of potatoes, as shown in the commercial, and the blades bent and eventually broke. We were not applying excessive force; the product just isn't made for that kind of usage.So, if you want an easy way to dice soft items, this is your product. Anything much more than that? Look elsewhere.Btw, it's easy enough to clean the thing with the tool included, but I found it much simpler to simply cut things with a knife. Much easier clean-up. If you have kids, though, or are clutzy with a knife, this is a great alternative."
1,Broke on first use,"I tried to chop an onion and pop went the whistle!! the plastic broke, so sad!!! oh well, the commercial looks easy but you need to put in a ton of elbow grease to chop onions and pray it does not break like mine did!!"
4,I love it!,"This chopper is so handy! Especially, for dicing your fruits and veggies, when you want a more uniform size for your dish. Unfortunately, one of the kids misplaced my little handy fork that comes with the unit for cleaning between the teeth of the chopper. But other than that, I love it!"
1,Very Expensive product and is not expected,This product is very expensive . They charged me extra $ 3.85 for postage due. I feel its not worth it.
3,Not so good,"Bought this after reading the reviews, found that the effort to prepare the food properly to get it to chop was almost as time consuming as just going ahead and chopping by hand. Does make for water free eyes in chopping onions, until clean up.Blades seemed to dull fast, as I have only had this for about 6 months. Will keep this as it does seem to do fries decently if you don't have a mandolin.Would not buy again even at $19.95"
1,Great item but HORRIBLE seller.,Item works great and it's fairly easy to use. However it took 2 MONTHS (ordered on October) to receive the item from this seller (As Seen On TV Guys) as our wedding gift (registry). They also do NOT provide tracking of your item and not very helpful when emailed couple times for your order status. Been using amazon for 8 yrs and NEVER bought from such an irresponsible seller.
1,Terrible!,"I have an electric chopper that i use for onions which is far superior to this product. I bought this mainly for recipies that call for diced carrots or potatoes, in order to get nice, uniform pieces. I have tried dicing onions, potatoes, and carrots and each time I had to stand and jump on the lever in order to get it all the way down. Cleaning the grates is also a pain. Definitely not worth the effort!"
2,The ad is cheating. They are cutting was onions !!!,"This thing needs FORCE.I am man - 5'9"". Nearly 180lbs and I still need good amount of strength to use this on a half-onion. It is good for things like half-Tomatoes/Mushrooms etc. but nothing bigger than a quarter of a small/medium onion. Plus the square area makes it unrealistic for big pieces anyway. The object to chop has to fit in the center half of the bladed area otherwise, as you press things will ""ooze"" out from the edges...and the biggest problem; who was that genius on earth that thought EVERYTHING in the kitchen should be cut in only two shapes - small squares and big squares! No slices at all...and the company doesn't even make a slicer blade for this!! Oh yes..that will need quantum mechanics education!! sorry!!! :-)"
4,Not easy to clean..,"This thing works but it's not like you can hose it off and it's ok. Onion membrane gets caught in the blades and I've had to sit and clean the blades and the plastic press with Q-tips because it got greasy in the sink. It cuts the onions really well though. Onion halves and quarters like what you see in the promo picture are too large and the press can be hard to close down on them. I would suggest making your pieces smaller by cutting them in half so the slicer can cut through without much force. Smaller sections cut through like a dream, wham bam and you're done. The cleaning of it is my only gripe, otherwise it speeds right through onion cutting and makes it so much easier and safer for klutzes like me with scary knives. Not easy enough to choose this method over slicing with very sharp knives if you know what you're doing."
1,Upset,"I ordered this and exited to use this for chopping onions , it's really disappointment after 2 uses I saw cracks on bottom tray and and for the 3rd use it's totally broken and I am unable to find the replacement for it &#128530;"
3,Tray breaks easily,"I have purchased 2 of the Chop Wizards, so I obviously like them, but the tray has broken on both of them. I now have several cutting grids, but no tray. The little plastic knobs that hold the top break off and then you have no way of using the lid to push the fruits or veggies onto the cutting grids. So the gist is, they need to make a more sturdy version of the tray."
3,disappointed,"When the chopper first arrived, (we ordered it from a little catalog) a hinge was broken when we took it out of the box. The one that finally arrived in its place worked very well (good enough for 5 stars) and we were pleased. About a month later, the hinge broke off. If using too much pressure was the problem, then they need to make it more ""heavy duty"" because it won't work without a lot of pressure."
2,Great but breaks easily :(,"I loved this thing when I first got it, but by the third week of using to chop veggies for dinner, the thing cracked and broke beyond repair. Bummer so buyer beware."
5,Favorite kitchen gadget,"This is my all time favorite kitchen gadget, it's easy to use and cleaning is a breeze. It comes with a little 'rake' to clean all the little bits of food left in the nooks and crannies. Works great for any food you want to cube, I use it when making oven roasted potato. Great for gift giving!"
5,I love this thing,I recommend this product to anyone and everyone.great as a gift!!!!very helpful in the kitchen very easy to clean. I'm so glad I bought this!!!!
2,It broke...,Chopping onions went well. It requires a quick closing action to work effectively. BUT it broke within a couple uses...Needs a studier case. Good idea with a bug that needs to be remedied.
2,Disappointing Vidalia Chop Wizard,"I tried the Chopper using half an onion. It couldn't cut through, and once the onion got wedged into the cutter squares I had to struggle to push it through until it went all the way with the 'click'. Then I tried using slices - that was not easy either. My eyes started watering from the onions. Yes, it was a little quicker than cutting by hand but not so much. Then I did a bell pepper. ALso struggled to force the top shut to cut the pepper. You have to make sure none of the vegetable will end up over the edge of the blade as this prevents it from closing. Then I did parsley and that worked well. A little disappointing considering they say you can cut a half an onion all the way through. Will try the larger blade then probably return."
1,Broke on the first use,"The first time we used it, the ear hinge that attaches the top to the bottom, broke off. We were only trying to slice a quarter of a small potato. Just too cheaply made. Going to look into something better. Don't waste your money."
5,Use fresh produce for great results,"Hello, I love cooking, but not the prep work involved. I saw this on TV, and bought it. At first, the chopping/dicing was too onerous and I got frustrated; then I read somewhere to always use fresh produce with this chopper/dicer. Wow! That made a huge difference. I, like most grocery shoppers, tend to buy fruits & veggies, and store them in the fridge. So I'm guessing, something in the fridge hardens the fruits/veggies? I'm not a scientist, so whatever the reason, always use fresh produce, and you'll have great results."
5,Great product!!!,"I bought this product over a year ago and still use it almost everyday. It takes a little muscle but not like some reviewers are saying. It's a great product and allows me to cut prep time sometimes to seconds. I have an electic chopper also but tend to use this as there is no setting up to do,and it's very easy to clean. It's a great little kitchen helper for the price!"
1,like plastic with your hasbrowns?,We planned chopping potatoes with the chop wizard for hash browns. First of all the lady of the house couldn't push it hard enough to do the chopping. Then when hubbie was able to push it hard enough to chop we had white plastic shards from the machine in the potatoes that took us 10 more minutes to pick out before cooking. They were neat little cubes with white plastic. There were also no instructions as what to chop with what blade.
5,Chop wizard,"Thank you for sending my order so quickly. This is one of the best kitchen helpers I have ever used. When I was given the chop wizard, as a gift, I was amazed at the ease of using it. It has become my right hand in the kitchen."
2,More work than it's worth!,"I chop onions...a lot. Like anyone, I hate getting all teary doing so, so I asked for this as a gift.Chopping - It is HARD to chop. Even when you put small chunks in it, you have to use a lot of pressure and really slam it down to chop. Not recommended for someone without muscles!Clean up - Cleaning this tool is a nightmare. Even in the dishwasher it doesn't get adequately clean. Bits of veggies get stuck in all the little squares of the blade, and also in the top area. The flimsy cleaning tool that comes with it bent early on, so I have to use a toothpick to get the little bits out.Stick to your knife! Or, I like to use my Swissmar Borner mandolin to slice up the onions, then chop."
1,"Good Idea, but not durable",I loved this at first. Makes chopping quick and easy. Problem is that you can't chop dense items like carrots. I used it to chop small carrots and the plastic piece that sticks out to hold the top broke off and the base cracked. It's unusable now. I've only had it a short time. I will not be buying again.
2,"worked fine, but the plastic hinge broke","This thing worked fine, but the plastic hinge broke while dicing carrots. This happened within a few days of regular use.I gave two stars instead of one because, it was pretty easy to use."
5,We have bought 2 of these!,"We are on our second chopper, we wore out the first one. It is everything they say it is; one of the best parts is that it's dishwasher-safe. Very much worth the price."
5,Vidalia Chop Wizard,"This makes short work of veggies in the kitchen! An awesome thing to have!! I make soup all the time and this is such a help to me in the kitchen. I cut potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, even squash (uncooked). I highly recommend this. We have given these as gifts to family and they also just love this product!"
2,Broke after five uses,"Worked well for five times. Then the ear broke off of one of the hinges. I tried to contact the manufacturer for a replacement lid, but was told they do not handle replacements. Returned to Amazon and purchased another brand chopper. Hopefully it will work better. The plastic ears are a poor design in my opinion."
2,Likes to not dispense ink!,"Gel ink pens are great, better than ballpoint, rollerball or liquid ink... because they tend to write really smoothly over many surfaces (computer paper, lined notebook paper, backs of photographs, copy paper, recycled paper, newsprint, post-it notes, etc.). However, I've found this pen really doesn't like to dispense ink from time to time after a few weeks of opening the package. And there's plenty of ink visible in the barrel! Shaking the pen so as to force more ink to the writing tip doesn't help much, either.There are better gel ink pens out there, such as Uni-Ball(R)'s Signo 207, which is a fabulous gel ink retractable rollerball."
5,More please,"The book was an enjoyable, quick read. At the end of the book you will want to read more. Please RM Secor write more, we will buy"
5,"Suspenseful, intriguing...didn't want to put it down",You will want to read more of Mr. Secor's work once you complete this book. I found myself intrigued with the characters and turning the pages at record speed. Order as many copies as you can and give them as gifts. Your friends will love this fast moving and thrilling novella.
4,How cruel RM Secor was to end the book like that!!,"Well, now we're obviously set up for the sequel. This was a very fast-paced, thrill a minute book. I would have liked some more character development for Amanda-- we only know her from Jim's perception of her character, although given how the book ends, perhaps that was the point. I will be anxiously awaiting the sequel, hoping it picks up exactly where it left off. This was an excellent first effort and Mr. Secor is bound to improve as he continues in his craft."
1,BAD BINDING,"BOOK BINDING WAS SO POOR, IT BEGAN CRACKING APART AT OPENING. CONTENT OF BOOK IS OF COURSE, EXCELLENT, HOWEVER DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK."
5,The Merck Manual Of Medical Information,"I give the Merck Manual 5 stars in general but I wouldn't buy this edition because it was written in 1999. Everything in this book is obsolete. It's very important to buy up-to-date medical books for proper information. If you're looking for a newer Merck, I would buyThe Merck Manual of Medical Information, Second Edition: The World's Most Widely Used Medical Reference - Now In Everyday Languagewhich was written in 2004 but is the most up-to-date Home Edition of Merck. HoweverThe Merck Manual 18th Editionwas written in 2006 but is intended for doctors. I wouldn't recommend The Merck 18th Edition unless you have a good knowledge of medicine."
5,This book is a must have!,"I love my medical manual. Anytime anyone in the family has a question about their body, we go straight to Merck. It is the best. Anyone who is anyone needs this book in their home."
5,An excellent addition to your library,"A clear, comprehensive no-holds-barred, no- nonsense explanation of any symptom, ailment, body part you've ever want to understand. Lay persons can learn about what's going on in the body--when to consult a physician about symptoms--what connects to what, etc. Should be on every intelligent reader's shelf."
5,Great!,"My 7 year old got this for Christmas, and wants to go out every day to ""practice"". We bought a couple of haystacks to have something to shoot at. This is ""real"" - the arrows have metal tips, the bow is wooden and almost as tall as he is, and when you shoot properly, it will go quite a distance - my 7 year old can shoot it over 50 yards and has only had it a few days. It comes with everything you need - the bow, several arrows, a thing with a belt clip to hold the arrows, wrist gaurd and two targets. One warning - it is not a toy, we require that he have supervision using it and shoot it only at the target. While the arrows are not really sharp, I would imagine that it could injure any person or animal it hit."
4,Archery Kids,Ordered this archery set for my six year old son after he expressed interest a couple times in wanting to shoot my compound bow- which he's just a wee bit small to handle. He's not a very big kid for his age- and this junior bow is probably a bit big for him- but he's determined enough in keeping up with dad and with a litt instruction (not much) he's got it down pretty well. As his skill level improves- I hope the next door neighbor lady's cat stays off the top of the fence.
2,Not great.,Arrow tips started falling off on first use.No arrow rest so the feathers hit the bow affecting accuracy.
4,Stand Strong,"I found this movie to be very realistic and a movie that every family would benefit in seeing. This family had it all, or so they thought. The beautiful home, expensive, cars, expensive toys, lavish shopping sprees, catered dinner parties but lacked any true family relationship. The youngest son was left alone while the family was digging itself into a financial hole. A great lesson is to be learned that things in life are easily lost but a love for God creates true love between family members that can't be bought and is not easily lost."
1,Stand Strong,"Based upon the preview I was very hopeful. Unfortunately, this movie fell tragically short. To begin with the movie went close to over the top with the family's rude, disrespectful behavior in an stereotypical attempt to show us what worldliness looks like. This presents too great a challenge to prevent young children from taking on rude, disrespectful behavior which they are already bent to do. Second, the acting was really poor - second rate. The younger brother's character was so pushy, arrogant and prideful that I winded up liking the back-slidden older brother better. Perhaps the final straw was recognizing this movie is obviously written by Mormons and the lifestyle and beliefs are evident. Unfortunately, any born from above Christian who has done their Biblical and theological homework cannot help but see the counterfeit this is."
5,Excellent piece for any Omega fan,"Have had this timepiece for a year now. It sustains accuracy of -1 sec per day. Sometimes it is -.3 sec a day. Beautiful piece. Excellent tough movement, one of the best non-coaxial movements Omega customizes. I personally do not know who actually cares for the release valve. You will be dead diving that deep before you use that thing :-) but I guess it adds beauty to the design.Great watch and one of the most affordable Omega pieces."
2,Got a chest cold with a nasty cough?????,"Ya know, when you're on a gluten-free diet, you YEARN for those forbidden treats - like licorice! (and malted milk!) Realizing that true licorice on this challenging diet is in the past and not likely to ever be repeated in the near future, we need to alter our expectations for this treat.I had tried this company's raspberry laces and strawberry laces - pretty good, although not easy to chew (think bubblegum). Not REAL licorice you understand, but pretty doggone good as an alternative.So I thought I try these too - how bad could they be? I found them pleasant to chew - not tough at all. But the taste? Nasty and medicinal cough syrup with an aftertaste that is truly awful.So I'm stuck with 11 packs.See if you can't find a source where you can buy just ONE pack to try out. Your tastes may be different than mine, and you might enjoy them."
4,Gluten Free Licorice,"Gluten Free foods tend to be extremely expensive when compared to ""regular"" foods. This licorice follows that trend. For the times when you'd like to treat yourself, Candy Tree Organic Licorice is a tasty and safe treat for Gluten Intolerant people. Amazon seems to have the best prices on it too."
3,"Not a great book, but an ambitious one...","This one can't quite live up to Business as Usual, but continues to merge the two sides of Garth Ennis (the ""Preacher"" side and ""The Punisher"" side). The story of corrupt cops is slightly generic. The story of the man and his search for a giant squid feels like filler. What makes the entire book worth it is the disturbing tale of the homeless and their hunt for victims used for unthinkable purposes. This one story is probably the best writing Ennis has given us since Preacher. Not a great book, but an ambitious one."
2,I get a WRONG pieces and It had been BROKEN on delivery.,"I bought 10-piece dinnerware set from Amazon. I was satisfied with that!! So I additionally ordered this set.But this time when I get a stuff, there're 8 bread plates instead of 4 salad plates! and A cup already had been broken when I open it!I'll return it right now."
4,Excellent,Trainspotting and Shallow Grave are excellently coloured and wonderfully imaginative....definitely a must read for anyone who's into distorted genius!
1,Dickies Shirts Suck,I have purchased many Dickies Shirts in the past. They were great shirts and lasted forever. I knew my size and figured it wouldn't be a problem purchasing them on line. It took forever for them to be shipped and when I got them they were horrible. They were the same kind of shirt I had purchased in the past but the quality and size was not the same. These shirts although sized as x-large were much bigger. I would have to gain a 100lbs to for them to fit. The length was also much longer and the material much thinner. I was very disappointed not just at Dickies but at the company that sold them and at Amazon as well. I will not be buying Dickies in the future and will be very careful about buying on Amazon because things have changed and it is not always clear who you are buying from.
3,Almost Perfect,"Great shirt, feels great. But here are two things I do not like. Stitched on the bottom front of the shirt is a Dickies logo. Since I do not tuck in my shirt I hate that it's there for everyone to see. On the inside is a huge tag for washing instructions that I had to cut off since it rubbed against my skin and made noise. Have no idea why they put these two things on this shirt. Not sure if I would buy anymore of these shirts."
4,Children's fantasy adventure to rival any.,"Open this book and embark on a delightful journey, with three spunky children, that is wild, dangerous and often hilarious. The fantasy story comes alive under Melia's skilled hand, and has the reader almost believing in magic carpets and weird creatures. A captivating read for all ages."
5,Blew me away!,"First heard them randomly from a buddy. Discovered this album and lost my mind! What G. Love was trying for but fell short of. Funky, deep, energetic, rhythm and soul. Incredible random find."
3,Good Album Overall,"This album caught my ear cause I'm fond of that nostalgic 1960's sound. I won't say that its great, but its definitely worth a listen. Reminds me of The Make-Up but not quite."
5,"Speed up your entry level, Vista Basic, Notebook Computer","Just add this extra 512MB module to your Acer Aspire 3680 and you will uncover more speed and some extra Vista features. It works like a charm and the price is very good. Amazon sends it to you with free shipping, and well before the promised delivery date. The easiest 5-star rating I have ever given."
1,Extremely dissapointing,"I bought this book the minute it was available, and read the entire thing the day I got it: what a tremendous let-down. I think it was the most redundant book I have ever read (and I have read hundreds). It easily could have been cut to half, or maybe even a third of its size without losing anything. Also, it was annoying that the questions were not organized like they were in Daybreak. Finally, while I might have made an incorrect assumption, it seemed that some of her responses were graphic descriptions of some of the final ""bad times"" with Bill (but not identified as such), even though when she was specifically asked to describe what happened, she refused (in order to protect her daughters). I own all of Mary's books and have read each of them several times; but I doubt that I'd ever have the patience or interest to get through this one again."
3,Worship,"This DVD is pretty average for the first part of the concert until Troy Snead takes the stage and then in catches fire!While this is certainly no Donnie McClurkin, Kirk Franklin, or Israel Houghton gig, it still has some really nice songs and will give one a good praise & worship experience"
1,Horrible,You first have to force it to work in XP. Compatibility mode. Then be prepared to be disappointed with the maps you see. Simple scans of old maps. Complete with creases and dog ears. No searches for places. A cheesy Win 95 app with little usefulness. Mired in a 640X480 view. Primitive panning and zoom. Bad all around.
4,I wish it were much more simply interfaced.,"I know very well through the ordinary version (=paper) that this is a marvelous dictionary. But dictonaries are just tools. so I would like to say for this digital version :"" the simpler, the better.""The window of the dictionary seems to show a little too much information for me, non native of English or French.The most disappointing thing is that this software cannot be installed in a normal Japanese version Windows, without a special means."
2,A Major Disappointment,"I was very disappointed with ""Disneyland USA"" because I just wanted to indulge myself in reminiscence about the park and there was just was not enough of the park represented to get the feeling of what it all meant to me. It left a big void in remembrances for me. ""Disneyland USA"" does not capture the spirit or heart of what Disneyland is or was. For a 2-disc set this is a major disappointment. There are several surprises and memorable moments contained but not enough to lift my spirits. I just felt sorry."
1,Disney does it again...,"What should have been a fantastic DVD release is scuttled by the Disney company. As has been documented in other posts, the shows are edited (although the box claims they're 'uncensored') and there are intrusive safety warnings during the firewalker scenes. Very silly. If this set was complete and unaltered, it'd be a 5-star release. Unfortunately Disney couldn't seem to get the release right despite the fact that the original shows air on the Disney Channel all the time."
3,It could've been so much more,"Watching these DVDs reminds me of what it's like to visit Disneyland during peak season: There's lots of anticipation, when you first get there all the pleasant memories of past visits come flooding back, there are some genuinely fun moments, but when things get slow then get REALLY sloooow (watching the ""After Dark"" segment is like waiting in line for 90 minutes to do Autopia - you keep wondering when it's going to get fun and when it's all over you swear never to do it again).If you're into this for a sentimental journey to the Disneyland of your youth, then some of this will be meaningful. If you like watching LOTS of entertainment segments sporadically interrupted by pictures of the park, you will be in heaven.Perhaps Ken Burns will do several hours on what the place means or the Disney people will go back and do some judicial editing for another type of documentary (perhaps the one that I was wishing I'd purchased).Oh well, it's still MUCH better than nothing."
4,"Great, but not the best...","I thought this was a great DVD, but I found it a bit lacking. I'm only 18, so I always ask my parents what Disneyland was like in their youth. I expected to see more about the Haunted Mansion, and Pirates of the Caribbean. I realize that Walt Disney died before the Mansion was completed, but those are some of the things I wanted to see. However, seeing so many rides, attractions, and changes was a great experience. My mom and I watched it and we talked about Disneyland the whole night. It was also a treat to see some footage of Song of the South. I understand why Disney has no plans for re-release as the characters and the many stereotypes were very racial to me. All in all, this is one of the better DVD's I've seen, and it is definetly a collectible. Now if only they'd release one on Walt Disney World..."
1,Surprise anouther edited Disney DVD.,This DVD is advatised as uncut & uncesored but it really isn't. Just like the Fantasia DVD. I can't stand when Disney tries to lie to there customers.
2,Be Warned: More Cuts,"Despite the package's Claim that the shows are uncut, The sequence with the 1950's Mouseketeers in ""Dateline Disneyland"" (after Mickey & Minnie enter the Disneyland theater) has been completely removed from the DVD. Not a treasure at all."
4,For Whom Ever LOVES Disneyland,"This is a good DVD overall. I enjoyed the t.v shows. I would have, however, like to have seen more of ""the making"" of the rides and maybe even some more current Disneyland on this."
1,Worst Products and Service I have ever used,"Initally got a defective product, needed a LAser cartridge ASAP, they wanted me to return before another one was to be sent. I told them if this was a long process I would order another one, they said not a long process. Took 2 weeks, then after using new cartride a couple of weeks, it no longer works.I will not use this vendor again, a waste of time and $$"
3,do the math and buy individually,"You save by buying each tape individually. Also if one goes wrong, you don't have to return the entire set. The only ones I really want are Horns of Nimon, Creature from the Pit and Meglos most people hate them, but they are some of my favorites. I also need to complete my Tom Baker collection and this will just about do it! 11 tapes at amazon(the best price anywhere on this rock) is 12.95 apeice and $142.45 total. Plus you can take just one bad tape back instead of one bad and 10 good. Logical? Perfectly! Elephants ARE'NT Pink!"
5,Pros and Business Insights.. A Great Combination,"Dale Dauten has outdone himself. This is more than in engaging story beautifully written. This book is full of important business lessons, insight and eureka experiences. Don't miss this one. It's a real keeper."
3,so bad its funny,"wahaha! is it just me, or is the hero way too feminine looking? a must see if youre in desparite need of a laugh. everyone does that 'spit' blood thing that looks like koolaid. love his method for picking up women though. and when he cuts the sumo guy in half... watch out, youre gonna bust a gut wahahahaha!"
5,Berkley yellow honey worms from Amazon,I had seen these mentioned as the bait of choice for some large trout that were caught in east central Pa. last year so I decided to give them a try. First cast with this bait netted me a nice rainbow trout within minutes. The yellow colorseems to really entice rainbow trout to bite. I have tried red and natural but they don't seem to work as well.It may be that the yellow color is similar to trout eggs. I use two segments connected to form a bait about the size of an earthworm.
4,Lots of Information About What You Don't Know About Money,"I have purchased many 'money' books over the years, and, for the most part, most of them are filled with pages and pages of 'nothing new' information (like how many times do you need to be told how to do a budget?). This book is very different. First, it contains NO fluff. It's filled with meaty stuff and one needs to be able to focus and concentrate in order to digest it all. It not only gives you valuable new ways to view money;it also gives you an inside look at the Jewish culture and why so many Jewish people are wealthy. I'm only a quarter of the way through the book, but Its already changed my attitude about money, in a positive way. This book can help you make more money if you're in business, just by changing your the way you currently approach sales. If you're looking for a substantial book on money and how to view it from a 'hope someday to be properous' perspective - this book can only help."
5,Highly recommended and absolute must for everyone!!!!,"Outstandingly well written, deeply profound and meaningful. Anyone seeking to prosper and achieve happiness must read Rabbi Lapin's books.This book is more than enlightening it is correct in every aspect. This book is worth every penny, it has what everyone needs to know. This book should be used as a textbook in high schools, guiding teens to applying the laws of the universe that we do not even know exist. Thou Shalt Prosper has changed my thinking and has given mea different understanding on life. I am so grateful to Rabbi Lapin and seek to read all his books, apply these principles in my daily life and enrich others with this amazing Judaic wisdom.Thank you, for a wonderful opportunity of knowing how to attain success, prosperity and lasting happiness. This book has it all.Highly recommended!Savannah"
2,incomplete download but enjoyed what i received.,I purchased this and as it turned out I was only given the free preview but charged for a complete book. What little I was able to read I enjoyed but was cut off in the middle. I refunded the free preview and was given the full price back that I had been charged. I will wait a while and try again. I really would like to finish the book.
3,Thou Shall Prosper,"Im not done reading it yet but the author says on page 32 ""Tens of thousands of people are able to take care of their families because they have a good job at Wal Mart."" Really Rabbi Lapkin? On $9.00 an hour, which what they pay. How would you feel if say your son in law wanted to work there and provide for your daughter and grandchildren, on $9.00 per hour.? I been suspect of any further opinions he offers since reading that."
3,Very disappointed...I expected more,"Some good information, but most of it is just old-fashioned common sense with a huge dose of right-wing ranting about how used and abused those in business are. Along, of course, with commentary on every conservative viewpoint known to man. It doesn't take long to see the bias. If you have nothing better to do, go ahead and read it."
4,May challenge your view of Money and Business,"Rabbi Lapin makes some great points in this book about the centuries-old Jewish views and traditions towards business and money. Many in today's society look at business as a less than ethical or admirable profession - which in turn brings a negative connotation about those who earn money through business.The Rabbi's 10 Commandments for making money tell us that money and business is not bad, but is on the contrary one of the most ethical pursuits we can have. A business can only be successful through service to others, and successful individuals can help other succeed.A good read that will make you feel better about earning, having and spending money."
4,It's good if you read it,"There are enough good ideas in this book to put your life in a whole different direction. The only question is will the reader actually do that. It's easy to read a lot of self-help books, and feel you're improving. You can become a self-help expert. But you need to act. Lapin has some ideas in here that I've really wrestled with. And I've started to change aspects of my career because of it. Anxious but important work. Read the book, then do the work."
2,Some good points but difficult to read...,"While this author has some good points and wisdom to share it is a very difficult read because it is horribly wordy. The author seems to go on and on and on about each topic/point. I found it very boring and difficult to read (and I love to read self-help books and have quite a collection of them). I think that the author should have either hired a ghost writer or the editor should have done a better job of cutting the wordiness out of the text. I finally started reading the summaries at the end of the chapters instead of the chapters itself. This had the potential to be a good book if it had been written in an easy read format. It would have been a much shorter book, though."
3,Parts that are Slow and Parts that are Very Good,Alot of insight in this book in dealing with the mindset of the Jewish lifestyle and work ethic. There are parts that drag on too far BUT there are really good Chapters that have provided me insight into ideas that I had not previously considered. Overall....it's worth reading.
1,Seen on You Tube,"Love the rabbi but the contents of the book are simplistic, get customers in church, but since Jesus flipped out when men turned the temple intoa store, I suggest doing business outside of the temple, temple should be to sing and praise GOD Honor GOd and God will HONOR YOU BACK, thats the winning advice..."
4,Thou Shalt Prosper,"Interesting approach to managing the resources God has provided to us. I have read Dave Ramsey's book andhis strong endorsement of Rabbi Daniel Lapin's book. ""Thou Shalt Prosper"" was a great incentive to acquire thisbook."
5,Great Book,"This book is great. I love they way it ties religious beliefs to business actions. The Jewish culture really plays a role in how the interact with others, making them successful in business. It also shows how the media has given the business man a bad name."
5,A worthy read,"As a money manager, I found this book very interesting. Though it is a bit wordy, I like the Rabbi's matter of fact writing style. We forget the Bible has much to say about money and in America the pursuit of it seems to be many people's God. This book helps put thiongs in perspective."
2,Where's the rest of it???,"Loved the show, both when it originally aired and in re-runs. I just wish they'd put out the complete seasons like most other shows are doing. I'd like to pick my own favorites as opposed to relying on Michael J. Fox's. I don't think it's worth buying until they release the complete seasons."
2,"Spin City minus Michael Fox""s Comments","I enjoyed the shows on the dvd. I did not like having to hear Michael Fox's commentary on each episode. Also, I would like to have the entire first season and let me choose my favorites."
5,Amazing,This is an amazing book by an amazing man.It is certainly a tell all book. Very good read and would make an excellent book for an assignment in History or English!
5,UN BONITO RECUERDO DE LOS 80'S,"El producto es bastante bueno y es lo que esperaba. Hay quien pudiera decir que le pudo haber faltado algo, pero en fin, el gusto se rompe en generos; para mis caso en particular es muy bueno. Buen material de la caja y su diseño elegante. La luz hace recordar inmediatamente y los CD de muy buena calidad en impresión. Debo decir que en algún momento tuve algunos CD que no eran originales pero esto vale mucho más. Tener el producto original vale la pena. Sigo recordando viejos tiempos con cada uno de los capítulos. Aunque me acostumbre mucho a las voces que fueron traduciedas al Español lo Recomiendo amplicamente."
1,DVDs are wrong format for UK residents!,"Having loved `Knightrider` from its concept,I was delighted to find that Amazon had this box set of every episode in stock and eagerly awaited its arrival. I was VERY disappointed then,to discover that every disc in the box was in NTSC region 1 format,which won't play in machines in the UK. To play these DVDs in my machine,they would need to be PAL region 2. Although Amazon have refunded me the total cost,they have yet to tell me if this set is available correctly formatted for UK DVD players. I have just checked the order page for this item,and it still says `Format:DVDs`. As my order was clearly labelled for delivery to a UK address,this was a very silly mistake for Amazon to make - the order page should clearly state which format the DVDs are. So UK buyers - BEWARE!"
2,"adventures of the stick insect and his ""member"" extender.","ah,the eighties had some rather hokey programes, knight rider is no exeption. largly due to it's choice of lead actor,i have never seen a man more in love with himself (with the exeption of matthew mcconaughey)than davey ""the hoff"" hasselhoff.(these two actors are under the elution that they are god""s gift to women) hoff'es hokey persona on knight rider includes, bad acting,an afro hair style (someone give him a haircut),a rodeo belt buckel and michael jackson leather jacket. what the role realy required is someone athletic but instead we get someone who resembles a stick-insect. as far as his acting goes, comes no suprize from someone who on bay watch has a retarded smile look on his face when he runs to rescue some unfortunate sod. the production value the effects still sort of hold up. as for his ""buddy,pal"" kitt (which could be percieved as an exestention of his manhood"" he still has moments of being just tolerable."
4,This collectors set perfect Knight Rider gift,"If you like corny 80's tv, and you like Knight Rider, get this collectors set. The box is as cool as the show. KITT is every man's dream car even though technology today is catching up."
5,"possibly the best, from what a ska band ought to be!","The Toasters always put out great records, this is comming from a non ska fan (tired of too much repetition, and what appears to be a competition among bands to out do each other). This one is solid throughout. Nicely composed and beautifully produced. I was first turned onto the Toasters probably more than ten years ago, and despite some personnel changes, they keep chugging along, creating imaginitive music. Not just for Ska fans."
5,FINALLY...Get Organized the Practical Way!,"If you want to have your own personal organizer--Read this book! Garcia offers simple, proven ideas and solutions to help you get rid of clutter once and for all. There are hundreds of great tips, good motivational quotes, and I especially like the how she included bits of advice from her readers and customers. It offers practical checklists for homes and businesses, realistic time estimates, and effective space-saving techniques. I love Garcia's innovative ""get organized now!"" approach. As a new professional organizer, I am in the process of reading any organizing book I can get my hands on and I was honestly impressed with this one. For the organized, disorganized, or someone in between, this book delivers!!!"
3,There are better systems out there,"Although Maria Garcia has a lot of good ""tips"" on how to do certain things around the house, if you are looking for a system to organize your housecleaning and everyday life, a better book to check out is Sink Reflections, by Marla Cilley. Her approach is ""down-home Southern"" and a bit unsophisticated, but it is useful, practical, and loving. It is especially good for SAHMs [...]"
2,Electronic Solitaire Card Game,"I have had one of these previously and it has lasted for over 3 years before going dead. This one keeps going dead every 4 or 5 days. After fiddling with the keys and batteries it finally comes to life for a few more days. I have been hoping it would get better, but it has not."
1,All Can't Be Bad Can It?,I must be honest and tell you I bought this for my wife but she gave up on it because she couldn't see the screen well enough to play. No back-light so you must play under a bright light... not what I/She wanted. Don't know about anything else because we can't see it well enough to continue. Not worth the effort to return so another piece of Chinese electronics tossed into the Goodwill box.
1,Would Not Recommend,I bought this for my 9 yr old granddaughter that plays solitaire on my phone but the battery goes down so much that I thought this would be nice. She can't understand all the buttons and it isn't as easy at the phone version. Very disappointed in this product.
3,solitaire review,It works well as advertised. It would be better if it had a light or more clear visibility. It was OK for the price.
5,Just what I wanted,"had one a long time ago and enjoyed it then and I even enjoy the new one more, Thank you."
1,"Next time, send one that works","Under normal circumstances this is a fine game for multi-tasking in front of the TV, but this purchase arrived without the alleged ""included"" battery. When I put in my own (new) batteries the product just did not work. VERY DISAPPOINTING. Amazon handled the return promptly and effectively."
1,solitaire hand held electronic arcade game,solitaire hand held electronic arcade gameI hate it. the other one i had for 10 years and the buttons stopped working is still better. this is smaller and really bad.
4,I like it,It was smaller than I thought. And the buttons were in different places than the one I have now so I have to retrain myself. But I like it.
5,Solitaire Hand Held Electronic Arcade Game,Yhe orginal one person game! Much easier than using cards (fir trips or just to relax outside). I have always enjoyed this game but not having to keep up with 52 cards this is great!
3,game toy,hard to get use to and not quit game and start a new one. buttons should be off set so that doesn't happen
1,cheap imitation,"I had a solitaire game years ago and this one looked just like it. However, it is just a cheap version, the keys don't respond some of the time and you have to hit them again and again. I would not reccomend this game. I would send it back, but it is not worth the expense of postage."
1,piece of junk,"buttons are too small for adults. also buttons fail to function about 50 to 60 percent of the time. also, some buttons are placed in illogical positions."
3,Enjoyable but could be improved on,Had this game before and enjoyed it. Would be great if it had a built-in light for nigh time gaming. A bigger viewing area would even be better.
2,undependable product,I ordered 3 Solitaire games. Only one of the three games even worked. It is laid out awkwardly and difficult to use.
1,Not Happy,I purchased this item approx. 3 years ago and it gave good service until it wore out.The replacement arrived and would 'fail' about half the time [duplicate cards shown at the same time].The vendor indicated that they had no replacement. Amazon refunded my money.
2,hard to see,"It really lacks a backlight, makes it nearly useless. Play solitaire on your PC instead."
1,Junk,"This one was trash, display only half worked and keys would not function. Very disappointed. Good thing it was under 10 bucks."
3,Looks good but not instuctions,"I got this game for my grandma and the instructions were not included, I am disappointed with that. Does anyone know where I can get them to print out?"
1,One unit did not work.,Ordered two units and one did not work. Did not return it because of all the hassle for a $10 item.
1,Horrible game,"Reviewed by 79 year old male:Worst of many solitaire games I have owned. To many confusing buttons for what should be a simple game. Screen to small, difficult to suit cards. Oh well, Live and learn."
1,Not worth it!,We didn't have the game for 1 day and it doesn't work. The numbers get stuck and even after removing the batteries and putting them back in it still doesn't work! Keep your money.
1,poor,"very disappointing it didn't have a timer, not very challenging. I wish I could return it, but I lost the sales receipt."
2,The author can write well but...,"There is a story here but it gets distracted by the cheap sex. Passion is nice but the author can't seem to decide if the woman is a sheltered, high society young lady or a harlot. She goes from being a virgin to a seductress in one night. But, if you want to read a story with many pages of hot sex and you believe a pirate would think to take a bath in rose oil while running for his life, I guess this book is for you. I, personally, think the author should have some higher standards for her female characters."
4,Highly entertaining,I really enjoyed all the imaginative twists in this book. Loved thawing and would love a book on her youth.
3,okay,"loved the characters, kept me guessing, great read for those who knew more about Nepolean, that was too mush info for me"
5,Great Find!,"WOW! I am so pleased that I tried this book. The cover is a bit misleading as it might not be a true reflection of the content. The story is well written, full of action & romance, and draws you in from the first chapter. This was the first book for me by Marsha Canham and I will definately add her to my 'favorite author' list."
4,Swep Away,"I really enjoyed reading this story. It has a great balance of romance, adventure and humor. This is the first book I've read by Marsha Canham and I look forward to reading more."
2,Better if Gratis-,"There is not a common used phrase: persona non gratis- Gratis means an item you don't have to pay for, a giveaway. The author meant non grata, which means not welcome, not liked; instead. It wasn't a typo, the reference was repeated again, hmm. I did try to read more after, but frankly it was too contrived and 100% predictable. I bought it based on the good reviews, but it failed to catch my interest, too many stereotypes."
4,One Star Deducted For Lousy Timing,"This is a sweeping story of intrigue, exciting chases, and heavy breathing passion, the sort of fun only Ms Canham can deliver. I adore the two main characters and the secondary characters, especially Aunt Florence.However, points are deducted for too much coincidences in the story and too many interrupted foreplay. Next time Emory'd better lock the bedroom door AND the windows annd place a bazooka by the bed to shoot any interrupters before he and Annaleah check each other's tonsils."
4,Kindle formatting errors,"I enjoyed this book and recommend it to anybody who enjoys regency romance with slightly more explicit sex than the pure 'regency' genre expects - there is so much of this about nowadays that we may need a new genre 'regency+' for modern sensibilities.But the kindle version of this book has an annoying, but not critical, error in formatting; occasional sections through the book are indented as if the normal 'indent at start of paragraph' was occasionally replaced with 'indent entire paragraph'.On a larger font setting on a kindle this can indent the entire section in to about 1/3 of the screen. The problem is also clearly visible while reading it in the PC kindle application."
4,Good read,"lots of energy, fun personailities, and romance...read it in two days could not put it down..I suggest this my friends"
3,Good but also boring...,It has all the typical cliches a good book has but for me its just another action romance thats been done a thousand times. Just a bit boring for my taste.
4,Interesting but unbelievable,"I'm giving this book four stars for the unique plot. The characters were interesting and likable. There were minimal supporting characters to really grab a hold of. At times the book was very predictable but overall it was an enjoyable read. Not too deep, a tad sexy, overall fun."
4,Nice candles,"I'm enjoying these, although I must say that I've noticed not every one lasts for 5 or 6 hours. I've had some of them last only 3 hours. Even still... nice product (truly unscented, too) that I would buy again when these run out."
5,We love Mickey!,"If you like Disney you will love this Mickey in living color. Mickey Mouse is such a loveable little guy. He's even a hero on the classic favorite ""Brave Little Tailor"". I totally love this volume and I'm so glad I have it. Classic Mickey Mouse in color is truly enjoyable. It's nice to see the team too, I mean of course Donald Duck, Goofy and Pluto. One hilarious bit I can think of is the angel and devil pluto in ""Mickey's Elephant"". The bits of history and behind the scenes with Leonard Maltin are great too. They increase your appreciation for Disney and his team on these funny and delightful cartoon shorts."
5,Very rare DVD plus the best out there!,"If you want the classic mid and late 1930's cartoons I suggest you buy this DVD! This has lots of entertainment. You will not regret when you buy this DVD! I Highly Reccomend this DVD to The People who missed the cartoons. people, they don't show the 1930's cartoon in the disney channel anymore! so decide quick before the DVD's sell out. Why Is the DVD fifty bucks or more? good question. A: because they don't make them anymore. plus they got the best out there. hey even it is fifty bucks, do not hesitate! BUY NOW!! ITS GETTING HOT!!"
2,Great Shorts - Crappy Menus and Tired of Leonard,"Its a great collection of shorts! And really great pencil test cut-togethers of three different cartoons!BLAH! The menu's are really ignorantly layed out with a lot of the shorts not listed, but 'hidden' as icons -- so you have to search to find the short you want to watch -- Really foolish! The annoying film critic, Leonard, keeps popping up all the time too! It turns out he doesn't have much to say, but he's in front of almost every cartoon blabbering!!!!"
4,A good release.,"These Mickey mouse cartoon are not as good as the BW Mickey toons. Mickey is teamed up with Donald,Goofy or Pluto must of the time. That's not to say these cartoons are not good. But Mickey is upstaged by these characters."
4,"A highly browsable, NEAT book.","COMFORTS OF HOME is an awesome book that tells (in beautiful pictures as well as words) the story behind all the household conveniences we have grown accustomed to. After spotting this title in the architecture section of my local independant bookstore, I knew I would be leafing thru it for the next several minutes--I love a good illustrated history or technical book. What I didn't know is that just browsing this really interesting volume would lead me to purchase the book. And not just one copy, either. I ordered several copies on the internet for a number of my friends that I know will appreciate the old pictures and the story behind toilets, kitchens, microwaves, etc.Good job, Merritt Ierley!"
3,Not sure I'd pay this much for a spoon again.,"I bought this hoping that it was the Cadillac of silicone spoons. Turns out its just okay. Ive owned this spoon for over a year and the silicone is starting to chip off. I was hoping that the actual spoon would be more firm, but it bends when trying to ground up hamburger with it. It does have a lifetime warranty against damage, so when the chipping gets bad enough it might replace it."
3,Better than average spoon.,"As to function, this is above average. But the finishing was poor. I'm surprised this manufacturer would produce, or allow to be produced, such sub-standard workmanship."
3,"Vegie Tureen, A Hole for a Spoon? Where's the Spoon?",I'm really glad it has the cut away for a ladel / Spoon. But does the Mfg make one? Where can I find additional serving pieces?
5,Review,"The Guide is excellent. It's an invaluable tool for becoming more effective during initial interactions with girls. The book provides good, simple techniques for overcoming social anxiety and specific advice for meeting and dating women. It is clearly written, lively, and very enjoyable to read."
4,Not Bad at all,This is a no B.S guide to picking up women.I thought it could have been a little more meaty with info but all in all this book is something you definitely wanna keep around.
4,Worthy Read,"This book is a worthy read and quite interesting. The only concern would be that it does not deal with a situation where you are working by yourself, which other books touch on and I've used with success to get phone numbers or email addresses.Also the team approach they suggest with a wing commander and wingman can work better if there is also a Kamakazi, an attached man with no interest in picking up new women, willing to take one for the team while the wingman acts to seperate the target from the rest of her group."
2,save your money,"Even though this book is cheaper then most, it is still a waste of time and money to purchase. While it does give a little decent advice about picking up girls at clubs it is basically just a tiny pamphlet with a few ok pieces of advice and a couple ego boosting lines."
4,The author's tip about,"how to prepare for a wedding is probably alone worth the cost of the book. But if, like I, you prefer to meet girls in ever day places than you do at bars, this book may not be for you. The author says the book is more for social situations like parties than it is for picking up a random girl at a supermarket. The author believes that planning is the key to picking up girls. I did find one flawed piece of advice. The author says to carry gum and breath mints. A better strategy is frequent use of a tongue scrapper, tooth brush and dental floss. Gum doesn't get rid of bad breath, it just makes you look low class. It's better to bring along a small bottle of mouth wash."
2,Unsatisfied Reader,"this book doesn't really tell you how to create the ""Master Rap"" it claims to. all it does is say you should talk about sports if she's into sports, or talk fashion if she's into fashion, etc, etc, etc. it hugely focuses on how important alcohol is. also, it really doesnt give you a technique to get the phone number every time as it also claims. i was really expecting more from this book."
2,"Well, I guess you have to be British","Well, I guess you have to be British to really appreciate this series. It was OK but think it was wasted on me. kind of like ""Faulty Towers"" but not nearly so funny."
5,Best of British,"I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD in Canada for years, I can't understand why it's shown on American TV and not in Canada which also has a huge EX-PAT community.This comedy has to be the best ever from the UK, forgot the constant re-runs of Keeping up Appearances (which isn't very funny anyway) and Are you being Served, this is what British Humour is all about.If you are a Brit this will bring back a lot of memories for you, if not you'll still be rolling around at the antics of Del and Rodney, Marlene and Boycie, not to mention Grandad, Uncle Albert, Trigger and Mickey Peirce. :)"
4,Closed captioned?,"Neither the product description nor any of the reviews mention whether this set is closed-captioned or subtitled. The version I rented from Netflix has captions, but that isn't always a guarantee that the dvd's for sale have them. Could anyone who has already purchased this dvd let me know if it has captions? I'd really like to get it for my brother (who has lost the hearing in one ear) but he can't enjoy it without captions."
3,"Not the best, but not bad","Definitely not on par with ""Are you Being Served"" and the other top BritComs, but not bad. As a ""Frost"" fan I never thought of David Jason as a comedian, but he does a great job here. I really debated about 3 or 4 stars rating. 3 is probably too low. I wish there was a 3-1/2 star rating."
1,LAME SHOWS!,"I LIKE MOST BRIT SIT COMS. THIS ONE IS LAME, I AM SORRY TO GROWL. BUT ITS BORING MOST OF THE TIME. I CAN NOT RECOMEND THIS SERIES. I WOULD RATHER SLEEP OUTSIDE THAN WATCH MORE OF THIS SERIES! DEVIL DOG RATES THIS SERIES DOG MEAT!"
2,"Not enough ""true"" Hedda...","Hedda Gabler is a true bitch with a capital ""B."" While this version is fair, it cannot compete with the version entitled ""Hedda."" Glenda Jackson would receive applause from Henrik himself could he see her play his title character. If there was ever a true Hedda, it is Glenda Jackson!! It's a shame ""Hedda"" is not available in DVD!!"
3,Ho Hum,"I love Ingrid Bergman, but this film is not a favorite. It plays out like a stage play. The cast is considered some of the elite of British actors, including Sir Ralph Richardson and Trevor Howard. I guess I don't care for Ibsen. I believe he must have disliked women. It's worth a watch if you like Ibsen and the cast."
4,Good for intermediate japanese students,"This is not an easy book to work through but it is the bridge that I've been looking for. I'm well versed in hiragana, katakana and the meanings of a large amount of Kanji through James Heisg, Remembering the Kanji I.I've been wanting to jump into reading Kanji for awhile now. With an eye to working through children's books and finally towards novels in Japanese. I've found books that either were very easy (meant for the beginner student) or very hard (no explanation at all on how to read the kanji).This book, has done exactly what I wanted, a good introduction for the intermediate Japanese student with Chapters that get progressively harder with each story building on the last."
5,Great for review!,"This is not a book to use if you are starting out in Japanese. However it is a wonderful book if you have the basics under your belt and wish to review and go further in the language. I studied Japanese about ten years ago and have been wanting to get back into it. The beginning texts that I own are way to simple at this point and I am too rusty to jump right back into the intermediate text book. Kanji From the Start is perfect for my needs however. Working on the text a little bit at a time brushed up and increased my knowledge of grammer, of Kanji and Kanji compounds.I should note that while the grammar notes are quite useful it is helpful to have other references on hand to dig deeper into some of the more complex sentences."
2,too little for the price,"My granddaughter asked for hand sanitizers and I ""caved ""on this one against my better judgement. I thought there would be more to it. The picture was different than what's shown here.My bad."
2,Moralizing should be more staisfying,"I agree with most of the editorial reviews for this book. One would expect soem social commentary -- even a lot -- but this book just wasn't that interesting. I thought the farsical parts of the book actually outweighed the more ""serious"" parts.A decent read, although not a light one."
3,Initial comment,"After reading a review in the L.A. Times and the Publishers review, my first question would be in regard to plausibility: why would a christian college invite a secular humanist to lecture at their college?"
5,Works well,I dunno how healthy ginseng is but I have taken some to relieve stress and feel like this was a good try to see if it worked
2,It may work for others but not for me,i didnt notice any increased energy but it did make me light headed and off balance. I also got sick after three days of use and discontinued use and felt immediately better. maybe it will work for you but i didnt get what i expected.
1,Sleeping pills,I ordered this product based on the reviews on it. I was in hope of finding a coffee replacement and I found the total opposite. I took one of these in the A.M. and never made it to work I completely passed out.!! On my day off I tried it again and surely enough I fell asleep! So now I take them at night for a good nights rest!
5,Siberian Ginseng,"A wonderful herb that helps with stress, builds the adrenal glands and helps to prevent winter illnesses. Nature's Way also provides recommendations and dosage on the label."
2,Where are the rest of the episodes?,"I'm a HUGE fan of Spin City, but like the 2 Married...with Children DVD's, this is just a collection of a few episodes. Where are the complete season DVD sets??? That's what I want (but, will probably never get because it won't come out). Very dissappointing..."
2,Isn't it time for the season sets?,"I love this show, but it's pretty sad that after all this time there are no complete season sets being released. I would never buy this DVD set simply because the episodes are random and from 4 different seasons. If they do release a complete season set I will buy it in a moment, but not these stupid collections."
3,Oh for the love of god will they just come out with the season already!!!,"Spin City is a fantastic show and my personal favorite. But I have to say it is so frustrating that they still have not come out with the seasons yet. I see all these show that I have never even heard of, and others that quite frankly were just crap and yet they refuse to come out with the one show that I love the most because Dreamworks wanted to do ""something different."" What they really need to do is strike while the iron's hot (well slightly hot at best) otherwise there sales will not be as great as they could be."
2,Surely I can decide myself which are the best episodes?!,"Disappointing! Cause even though I love this show, its highly presumptuous to assume the Mr J Fox will know which episodes I'll prefer better than I do myself - what a cheek. This lacks something simply for that reason, thank god other comedy releases give you the benefit of ALL the episodes. I'm hoping that they'll eventually release in that format, and i'd certainly then give it a lot more stars."
1,Learn some history - elsewhere,"Do you people even have a clue what you are talking about?Go and study some actual history instead of this tainted rubbish, and learn what actually happened.Too many corrections to make to even begin."
4,Pretty Good,"I really think this anime was really good. It's not too confusing and its just plain fun. It's not the best anime out there, but it's worth seeing, atleast renting."
3,Glass half full,"The firm was a good film in terms of capturing the feeling of being part of a firm. It isnt overblown and provides a trip back in time.On the other hand, elephant is simply gratuitous violence, its a waste of a dvd."
1,Horrible Movies,Where do I even begin? The Firm's fight scenes were not quite up to par with The Westside Story. They sucked bad. Elephant was so good I turned it off 10 minutes into the movie. I'm not sure I've ever done that before with a movie. That's pretty much all you need to know.
3,O.K. Not as Good as Green St. Hooligans,"I thought the story line was good, but lacked virtual action. Gary Oldman played a great part like he always does"
4,A good live ska album,This disc is worth buying even if you are not a huge ska fan. Its catchy enough for most anyone to like it. Dont buy it for your kid or play it in front of your mom though --- pretty vulgar at some points!
2,Don't Waste Your $,"Quadroon is an interesting movie. It's the first movie to depict the cruelty and mistreatment of black women during the AnteBellum time. However, the acting should be compared to a junior highschool stage play. This movie doesn't get interesting till end."
1,The epitome of what a wasteland America is,"This is not a book, it is not worthy of the title book. I perused it for kicks at the bookstore and nothing else. MTV dug long and hard to come up with a group composed of such whiny, twitty, flakey brats. The notion that the Real World is an oceanfront pier in Seattle furnished by IKEA. Thanks MTV, for coming up with more media in dire need of ridicule."
2,Made Me Snooze,"When I picked up this book of stories it was the promise of something a bit crazy that attracted me. I should have known better. When ever people say something's a bit dotty I usually find the stories pretty bland, and this was no exception. It made me feel a bit creepy -- the way sitting in Creative Writing classes made me feel. There's this sort of precious, trying-too-hard, attitude that permeates this collection that reminds me of pink hair, unfiltered cigarettes and black clothes, but not of great writing. There's no enduring heart or grit about these stories. They're slick, fluent and trendy, but not the sort of thing I would ever read again. It struck me that Boyle is one of those writers who appeal to the folks who are worried about how ""colorful"" their adjectives are, and sound contrived as a result. To me, he just isn't that interesting."
2,Oldest Ghosts,"Living within a few minutes of St. Augustine, I eagerly looked forward to the publication of this book. Unfortunately, it is poorly written, and one of the stories is set in upstate New York! I hate to purchase a book--believing it is about a certain area--only to discover it contains accounts from other parts of the country. I found Oldest Ghosts very disappointing."
3,Beautifulcover of book but that's about it,This book wasn't really what I was looking for. It didn't really tell the ghost stories it was more like summaries. I like David Lapham's book a lot better which is ghosts of st. augustine.
3,"Interesting, but rather far fetched","Interesting historical detail, but rather a fantasy in other respects and quite far fetched. NOt interested in others in the series."
4,An exciting read,"The Killigrew series is not lacking in action and daring do. I enjoy the books, however there is poor editing and the characters are underdeveloped. I've read them all--Cornwell, O'Brian, Lambdin(my favorite), etc. Lunn is OK but he doesn't seem to improve or expand. Perhaps that is too harsh, he does explore a time and events that others ignore. I'll keep buying."
5,the only shampoo i've used for two years!,"if you have fine hair that goes easily limp under the weight of most shampoos and conditioners, but you also need a good dose of moisture, there is nothing better that mop glisten. the difference in my hair is so noticeable whenever i use anything else. i am a die hard fan for life. i can not recommend this highly enough."
5,wonderful light natural shammpoo,great product--have been using it for years and I am happy I can now order it from Amazon...
4,Skavoovie Rocks From Ska Capital Boston!,"This album is a wonderful debut from another gem at Moon SKa Records in NYC. The CD starts off good and sort of ends on a sour note. Old Man Of The Mountain is by far the best track on the album. I highly recommend seeing them live, and remind them to sing the coffee song!"
2,"Pleasant, but not thrilling","Fairly likeable stuff, but I would have liked a little more pep in the music; and not so many instrumentals."
5,A very classy souvenir. Buy It!,"'Above Chicago' by aerial photographer Robert Cameron is an example of my very favorite type of souvenir to buy when I was visiting a new city, generally on business. There is simply nothing quite as evocative as this truly amazing selection of photographs of an eminantly photogenic city. I have seen similar efforts done, for example, by David King Gleason on Boston. And, while Boston is easily as interesting a subject as Chicago, Mr. Gleason doesn't seem to carry it off quite as well. I do miss the bit of local color added to volumes on London (Alistair Cook) and San Francisco (Herb Caen), but the star of the show is the quality and expert selection of photographs."
5,breathtaking new look,"i have looked through this book several times and it has given me a magnificent bird's eye view of the city in which i am living. i'm into architecture and city photos, which made ""Above Chicago' such a fulfilling book."
2,Really bad picture quality.,"Kimba The White Lion is a classic anime series that has been released on DVD by several different companies. The ""Ultra Edition DVD set"" has the original Kimba; the others have later re-workings of the series. This DVD here is one of 4 Kimba DVDs released by Genius Products. It comes in a carboard envelope and contains 2 Kimba episodes: ""The Birth of Kimba"" (original title: Go, White Lion) and ""The Law of the Jungle"" (original title: Great Caesar's Ghost). These are the 1993 version of Kimba, not the original. The picture quality is really washed out; these DVDs were very poorly made. The only thing they have going for them is that both episodes have both an English soundtrack and and a Spanish soundtrack."
4,Great Sports Book,"I enjoyed the book, The Rebounder, by Thomas J. Dygard because the action in the book made me want to keep reading it. Compared to other sports books, it is better because the different events that happened in it kept my attention. I am an 8th grade boy and I think other 8th grade boys would enjoy reading this book."
