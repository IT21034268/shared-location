4,Good but some questionable options,"i like this tv. It looks really nice and is awesome when watching dvds. The only problem is that it has some questionable viewing options left out. Unless you watch a widescreen movie in 4:3, there is no way to have the movie fill the whole screen without part of the sides being cut off. This is just Ludacris. IT should show the image to the end of the dvd on each side and then fill the screen as much as it can, with no sretching just showing the original aspect ratio. Doesn't that bug others that u are always losing video. The widescreen option on that tv is like watching widescreen on a 4:3. The only somewhat exceptable mode is subtitle zoom."
3,It's O.K.,I like the song don't mess with my man but the girl you are talking to is not going to listen to you so why make up a song like that she is still going to mess with your man. For the guy he is still going to want to have sex with your girl and he is not going to stop what are you going to do beat him up it still is not going to stop him. The C.D. is o.k. Everybody don't buy the C.D. it will just make her Richer. She sounds like a lot of other singers I already heard. May be the girl/or boy don't want another man may be he/or she wants just yours nobody elses.
3,"Cute single, very average album","After reading all of the wonderful reviews of this album, I purchased it expecting some good beats and strong songs. I was very dissapointed! The single, ""don't mess with my man"" is good, but the rest of the songs on the album are very weak and underproduced. Nivea has more talent to offer than this weak album displayed. No strong vocals and no strong beats make this a very mediocre album and certainly not worth the $ I paid for it. Better CDs: TLC-3D, Celine Dion: One Heart, Nelly."
2,Average but Catchy,"Vocally not much different than Ashanti but the Cuts like ""don't Mess with My Man"" with Jagged Edge&The R.Kelly Written&produced ""Laundromat"" are the Cuts here."
5,One Perfect Book,"Stephen Kenyon escapes his empty life as a Duke when he finds out that he has little time left to live. He runs into an acting troupe, the Fitzgeralds, and falls in love with adopted daughter Rosalind, whose past is as mysterious as the illness about to claim his life. Rosalind, who already carries the memory of a bland marriage, agrees to marry this man she hardly knows even though he begins to sink, his health deteriorating in front of her. Even though we know Stephen will not die (he's the hero!) it is Putney's brilliant writing that has us biting our fingernails as we see that the number of pages in the book are less and less. Wonderful."
2,Had more potential,"This author came highly recommended, but I just don't think she's for me.This is the seventh book in the Fall Angels series, but knowledge of the previous books isn't necessary. A duke finds out that he is dying of a rare disease so he does what is least expected of him and sets out anonymously on a journey to find himself and deal with his grief. Along his way he meets up with a group of traveling actors, saves one of their children, and integrates himself into the group. He quickly falls for one of the actresses, a lovely widow, and she for him, and they marry. Meanwhile, his doctor and brother are desperate to find him, and all is not what it seems.There was so much potential in the terminally ill hero estranged from his family, but I thought the execution ended up being bland and lacked depth. I also found the ending disappointing because of a heavy-handed and contrived near-death experience as well as a disappointing (to me) revelation about the heroine's heritage."
3,not a book that stands out,"This book had very likeable characters. I wanted to know where it was going to lead to. That is what kept me reading actually. A Duke decides that since he's dying he is going to take off for a month of anonymity. Wouldn't we all like to do something of that nature. Anyhow, he falls in love and marries someone most unlikely. The ending has a nice twist to it that is resolved and we can move on to the cookie cutter type happy ending. I did enjoy it, but there were no real surprises."
2,"The last book, the worst book","I think this will be the last book of the Fallen Angels Series, and is the worst of them, if you compare this book with the others, you will understand me that I only wanted to finish it because I wanted to know the end of the story, if this were the first book of the series that I read, I would not finish it."
1,Did not like it...,"By page 37, Stephen, the Duke of Ashburton who thinks he is dying, lies about who is to pretty (sort of pretty) actress Rosalind, the adopted daughter of an acting family. Has not this been done before to death, this hiding of ones noble family lines - why bother again? It is such a drag to have to flip pages in a book when the first misunderstanding happens so quickly. There will be the ""betrayal"" she will feel when he reveals himself. I also found it ridiculous that a man of his rank would not set his affairs in order and especially that he would not let his brother Michael know the situation. These books are beginning to be very tedious."
5,One Perfect Book,I am a 15 year old girl who loves to read but has never set my eyes in a romance novel. I have enjoyed this book completely and have started looking into others. This is a book that will capture your attention time and time again. The author has picked a strong story line and the perfect charactors. This is a book that you will never put down and if you did it would be pure agoney trying not to think of it. It has an unpredictable ending that will have you heart pounding from the romance. I would recomend this book to everyone I know. Please try it for yourself. You won't regret it.
1,Seriously?,"I'm stunned by all the positive reviews of this book. For me it was unreadable. I found the romance to be a ""wham-bam"" kind of thing, the hero stilted and uninteresting, and the entire tone of the book felt like something written by somebody with no idea of the mores and history of the Regency period. I know this isn't true because I really enjoyed Putney's ""The Rake"".This book was just painful. There are actually moments when one of the daughters comments on her parents' behavior by saying something like, ""There go the Parents again, misbehaving!"" It was more like Gidget than something you'd associate with the 18th century. I guess there must be a huge market for heroines who act like they are from 2013, but are stuck in the 18th century, because that is what this book felt like.I'll read more Putney because I've read several of her books that are quite good. This is not one of them."
3,Average,"I never really got into his character at all, and the love scenes were kind of flat. The bit at theend where he is so ill seems to go on forever and the book generally seemed too long for a very light-weight story with characters who lacked depth. His sister was dire. His brother detracted from the book. A good way to pass the time, but not a great book."
4,for once a book that did not have a predictable storyline,this plotline is refreshing: something new/not done to death. You can't predict what is coming and the ending really is a surprise.
3,I'm Not In Love With it....,"...like a lot of other people where. Certainly it was well written. But, I had a difficult time dealing with the fact that the hero and heroine got along so well...with no conflicts whatsoever. Rarely did they argue or raise their voices to each other. I found the romance almost too 'perfect'. He's nice, she's nice, her family are all nice. Everyone is too NICE! I figured out the ending from the first chapter. I am far more interested in Michaels story. I am going to check out her Shattered Rainbows novel next."
4,Good Hanky Read,"I love hanky reads, however very few get me into tears. This is one of the few. This is a story about a man with only months left to live and the woman who dares to love him."
5,Great book!,"I was bawling like baby at the end of this book. This was the second of her books that I've read and I'm very impressed so far. I read ""The Rake"" first which is also very good, but I think I like this one better."
4,Wendy tells it like it is!,"I wasn't sure if I would be able to relate to this book. I knew it was about a girl with a weight problem and her struggles to lose the weight. I have always been skinny and have never battled with my weight at all. Even though Wendy and I do not share weight problems, I completely related to this book. Wendy tells her story and shares the ups and downs of her daily life. There is something in it for everyone. Not only does she struggle with weight, but dating, friends, etc. Her style is wonderful. There is a lot of swearing in the book which took a while for me to get used to, but you feel like she is talking right to you. I found the book hilarious and laughed out loud often. I also could feel her emotions when she was sad or upset. It was the emotion that I could relate to most.This is different than the typical novel. I really enjoyed and recommend it to any woman looking for a funny, entertaining read."
4,It reads as well as a good fiction!,"I think the title says it all. Wendy's blunt look at her life is hilariously refreshing. Her foul ""mouth"" was difficult for me to read through at first but I couldn't help but fall in love with her. The Weight Watcher's menu cards in the middle of the book nearly killed me. I actually looked them up to see if they were real...they were! OMG I can't believe people actually ate those!Anyway, I highly recommend it to readers of all shapes and sizes. There's something in this book everyone can relate to."
5,Not just another BLOG,"This book was hysterical!! I loved Wendy's take on dieting, dating, and the world in general. The book was touching and at the same time had me laughing so hard, people would turn around and stare at me. A quick read, it took me about 4 hours total to read the entire book. Something about her quick wit just kept me turning the pages! One of my top recommends, I look forward to more titles from this author!"
3,"smart, funny, relevant -- what more could you want?","this book is freaking hilarious. i related to it very much, and left me with plenty to think about on my own road to self-acceptance. while some lament the blogger-turned-author trend, i tend to embrace it. i really don't care how mcclure entered the literary world, i'm just glad she's here, giving us someone intelligent and funny to read on the topic of weight issues. she needs to write more of them, and we need more writers like her."
1,One New Me to Be Skipped,"After viewing all the reader feedback, I was eargerly anticipating the arrival of this book. I'm sorry to say I purchased this one. For those of you who can tolerate frequent (not rare or even occasional) profanity in the form of ""f"" this etc...this book is one you can get through. This read more like a version of ""Bridget Jones Diary"" with occasional references to the weight loss journey. The author uses comedy to poke fun at her experiences and, I believe we can all find things to heartily laugh at in this book. But for me, comedy doesn't come in the form of crudeness, or belittling others so the one or two laughs didn't overshadow the more frequent cringes. I don't doubt some will enjoy this book. But for others, please know that if you're looking for a clean read, full of insights and exploration of a weight loss journey, this may not be one for you."
2,OK book,I thought this book was kind of cute. It has no tips on losing weight. It is just one woman's story about dealing with life in realtion to diet issues. It was not an inspiration to me but for the price. I thought it was a decent break from dealing with my own life.
4,Loved it.,I loved this book. The author writes beautifully and I felt so many of the things that she has gone through. And? She's hilarious and pretty much rules.Loved it!
3,"Funny, but a little pointless",Just the Weight Watchers cards in the middle of this book almost make it worth the purchase price! They are SO FUNNY...But the rest of the book....ehh...just ok.
2,Just OK,"I wanted to give 2 1/2 stars, as this book was really just a straight ""OK, not particularly good nor particularly bad"". I wanted to like it and think it had potential, but when I was done I was just kind of apathetic. There were definately some cute passages, but overall I didn't feel like the author let any real personality come through. I felt like she kind of meandered along, telling us about her life a bit, but never really getting to the point. I don't think everything necessarily has to have a grand point or meaning, but in general I like to get at least a little something out of what I'm reading. Towards the end I just wanted to finish it up so I could read something more interesting."
4,Terrifically Funny!,"Wendy McClure entertains and charms her audience with a collection of witty, beautiful, and funny tales regarding her personal weight loss battle in ""I'm not the New Me."" McClure begins by telling her audience that every fat girl has a fat story about the trauma that caused the fat, but that she will spare us that recollection. Instead, McClure treats us to a bevy of hysterical anecdotes about her personal weight struggles, love life challenges, and family dysfunction.I found ""I'm not the new me"" to be delightful. McClure's writing is very reminiscent of Laurie Notaro, of whom I am a huge fan. I thought this book was engaging and personal, while being funny and vulnerable. I do hope that McClure writes additional works, because I am really in love with her humor and writing style.I highly recommend this book!"
5,"Smart, funny and sometimes sad","I read this book over the course of two nights and didn't want it to end. But when I did I was surprised in a really nice way. McClure's writing is fresh and candid yet also sweet and sometimes melancholy. She's not afraid to put her emotions on the page - the pretty ones as well as those the rest of us usually try to hide. I don't think there's anyone - fat, skinny or in-between - who couldn't relate to McClure's narrative about love, loss, friendships and body image."
1,Another loser from Asylum.,"Corpses Are Forever is a poor excuse for a movie. I don't know which is worse, watching an Asylum film or having to endure a David DeCoteau film. The local corporate video chain store likes to carry their videos. Their shelves are stocked to the gills with there DVDs. Asylum is worse because they try to hard. They try to hard to be cool, inventive and funny. Troma they're not. At least David DeCoteau has a market (people who enjoy homoerotic horror films). With name like Asylum you would think they would produce some edgy films. Not!Corpses Are Forever is filled with aging B-Movie stars andname dropping better films. They should have copied the other films. If they did the film makers might have made a better film. Alas, they fall victim of trying to hard. Maybe they should have tried harder. Corpses maybe be forever but this movie flat out sucks.Not recommended, avoid like hell!"
3,it was alright,"CORPSES ARE FOREVER wasn't so disastrously bad as everybody says it is. So what if our obviously faked kung fu hero doesn't look like fit enough to be doing those spinkicks? The plot starts out as a sort of film-noir David Lynch-esque style film meets cheesy zombie fare. Sure, it eventually falls down into muddled stupidity, but whatever it does that so near the end of the film that it doesn't absolutely kill it all and make you angry.There's no major zombie action, they're more of a setpiece to spinkick, but the story itself is a nice little mystery which as ridiculous as it gets is still okay.If you're used to movies having higher budgets or being more tongue-in-cheek to hide its flaws, then you won't like this movie. But if you're used to the lowest of the low, you'll realize this one isn't so bad really, especially in comparison with a lot of other movies out there.It's no classic in any way, but I still enjoyed seeing it, and that's all I really need in a movie."
1,Good Lord,"Let me start by saying this movie is awful. Not entertainingly awful, or awful in a funny way, but just plain awful. It is boring, badly acted, and just plain lame. The acting is just really bad. The actors aren't even qualified to be b movie. The zombies are inactive the whole movie, until the end, in which they suddnely want brains. It really is a rip off of Return of the Living Dead, which is actually funny. The guy in the flashbacks has a really annoying voice too. IT should also be noted that the world looks more post-apocalyptic when cars aren't driving in the background and you can't see a gas station complete with working employees out of the windows. Absolutly horrible. Don't even bother renting it."
1,Corpses Really Act Poorly,"Corpses Really Act Poorly (C.R.A.P.) - Okay, so before I rip into this movie I want to explain why I gave it one star when it probably deserved zero. One half of a star goes to Jose Prendes for having a good idea, and one half of a star because it's a zombie movie.That's where my good will ends. The main thing that ruins this movie is our intrepid auteur Jose. His acting is only marginally worse than his martial arts skills. Watching the fight sequences felt like watching WWF. If a kick or punch landed within five feet of its intended target, it was a miracle.Our lead actor/director spends a good portion of the movie wearing a big felt hat that's about ten sizes to big for his head, trying to channel Indiana Jones or Humphrey Bogart in a sad attempt at Cinema Noir.Nice try, Jose, but you ended up being your own worst enemy. Get some actors next time, because your idea could have been interesting."
1,This makes a bad movie look good...,"Only two times in my life have I ever stopped a movie halfway through. This movie is one of them. I felt embarrassed for having my friends watch this with me and had to stop the movie short. Maybe the second half of the movie was better than the first half, but I didn't want to gamble another hour of my life in order to find out."
2,You Get What You Pay For...,Brought this flick from the DVD bargain bin. Not even aging '80s scream queens like Linnea Quigley and Brinke Stevens can save this piece of (bleep!)There were two actors who carried most of the film. They annoyed the piss out of me. What the hell man?This corpse of a film is better off dead.
1,Corpses Are Boring,"Corpses are forever has to be one of the worst movies ive rented in a long time. The only reason i really rented it was because the cover art zombie from Lucio Fulci's classic ""Zombie"" was on the cover. So I thought id give it a try. Big Mistake. Weird storyline. Bad makeup effects. Little action. And who really roundhouse kicks a zombie anyways? And hey lets stay with my psycho wife after she tries to stab me and not get with the hot nurse. Yeah...ok. Do yourself a favor and let this one rot on the shelves."
5,"A Solid, Clever Horror Thriller!","I don't know what the last guy is talking about! Corpses Are Forever is basically a movie that tries to do something different with the zombie genre, and I think it succeeds with flying colors. I have never seen a more clever, and unique horror concept on the shelves.This one is fun, smart, and inventive. The visual look forces you to pay attention to the story, and you have to, because it is quite intricate, and very well put-together.If you want to see zombie movies with a different twist (sort of like 'In Like Flint' meets 'Night of the Living Dead') then pick this movie up, it will not disappoint. And listen in on the commentary track, it is hilarious!"
3,get a half size bigger,"I got these shoes at the exact size of my feet which is 7 but at normal width. They were not as comfortable as expected...They were OK but not for long walks because when your feet start to congest at the end of the day, they become tight. My feet are a bit wide (not too wide but probably 7M) unfortunately there were none 7M or W sizes left. So I ended up having to return the product despite really liking the style. So I suggest try ordering it at half a size bigger than your normal size because I don't think it can be exploded."
2,Not much of a game,"I wasn't very impressed with this game. It shows that up to four players can participate, but that is only for a few of the short games. Most of the games are boring and the graffics are lacking very much compared to other Wii games."
2,Not worth reading if you're over 12,This book was full of great ideas for people 12 and under. if you're looking for good ideas for fun things to do on a date I would advise you to look elsewhere.
3,Dollhouse,"I bought this for my niece because my daughter got one last year, 2007. The new version, however, does not have a functional doorbell or telephone. Those to features are why my daughter loves hers so much. I do not recommend this new version. My niece still wants my daughters over hers."
4,Fun dollhouse,"We purchased this dollhouse for our daughter when she was 1 1/2yrs old and she loves it. It is great for imaginative play, however it only comes with a few household pieces and you have to purchase the rest seperately. It could initially come with a few more rooms."
4,Very good doll house for babies,"This doll house is perfect for my 1 year baby, who have loved it from first time she saw it. It have few accesories, but enough for good baby play moments. Seems very durable, exactly what I expect from Fisher-Price, cero dissapointments.Maybe it should come with more accesories, but for the price the whole package is perfect."
5,Great House!!!,My daughter just got this for Christmas and it takes a lot to pull her away. Often we find the family in her little purse or coat pocket! I know its says 3+ and she's only 2.5 but she just loves to put the baby in its crib or in its little chair! Its a must have for all little girls at this age
5,Tons of fun!,"My husband and I bought this for our daughter's 2nd birthday. It was definitely a hit. She has played with it every day since, multiple times a day even.We only purchased two rooms for it to begin with - the parents' room and the baby's room. This seems to definitely be the limit on furnishing the house while still having room to play. The pieces of large and bulky, which is excellent for younger children, but poses a problem when buying the accessory packs. I don't think the designers quite thought things thru when they designed the house. Had they made it a tad bit bigger, you would be able to put more in it; thus they would make more money because everyone would buy more accessories!In any event, we love it. My daughter and I can play house for ages without getting bored."
3,Mom of 2 girls,"The retailer needs to revise the description of this product! Take note, the doorbell and phone DO NOT MAKE SOUNDS!!!! Therefore, the toy DOES NOT take batteries.This house is very durable and my 2 year old daughter was thrilled when she received it for her birthday. She played with it for about an hour but then lost interest. There isn't a lot of furniture that comes with the house and I think that may be why she lost interest. I know you can buy additional accessories but found them to be an expensive addition. I may have to though to get her interested in the toy again.My biggest disappointed was in discovering that the doorbell and phone DO NOT WORK and the toy DOES NOT make any sounds. I found the retailer's description very misgiving and probably would not have added this to my daughter's birthday wish list if I had known this as I thought the sounds were a really ""cool"" feature. I would also have likely given this product 4-5 stars if the doorbell and phone did make sounds."
3,all furniture does not fit,"this dollhouse was bought for a 1 1/2 year old. She really likes to play with it, but I was disappointed that all of the furniture does not fit in the house. We bought all available furniture, baby' room, sister's room, mom and dad room, living room, and grandma and stroller. There are only 2 bedrooms and furniture for 3 bedrooms. Also there is a table and chairs for the kitchen along with living room furniture. Both rooms of furniture do not fit in the bottom of the house comfortably."
3,Lots of fun but paint comes off dolls,"My kids love playing with this dollhouse together (age 1 and 3). The one year old is too young and so she bit off the paint off the dolls noses and such. She still puts things in her mouth. Other than that, they have a blast playing with it together."
2,Average and should be cheaper,I think they are just charging more for the brand name. This should have been cheaper. Of course my 3 years old loved it but it's not great. Looks sturdy and colorful. But there is not much room for anything extra. Comes with 3 dolls and certain accessaries. It's not bad if you want something small for small space.
2,Needs to be bigger,"The doll house is nice, but do not waste your money on the extra furniture. The reason: there is NO room to put it. The problem with this doll house is that the rooms are SMALL and can not hold the extra doll house furniture that is an extra purchase. The net result is my daughter gets frustrated that the stuff won't all fit."
5,Accessories are overpiced on Amazon,"You can get all the furniture sets from fisherprice.com for under fifty five dollars, and that includes shipping and tax."
3,A smarter choice....,This set is ok. I suggest buying the larger FP dollhouse though. Little girls grow out of this set and are ready for more details and a nicer dollhouse by the time they are two and a half. I say go with the Loving Family Dollhouse and don't waste the money on this pre-dollhouse set. They will grow into the Loving Family dollhouse.
5,Love It!,"My 2 year old grandaughter just loves her Frist Dollhouse. She pretend plays everyday. We also purchased the Mom and Dad's bedroom and the TV room. My only thought would be to make the chairs that come with the set more user friendly.....none of the figures stay on the chairs when placed on them, they fall off. They do much better on the TV room red chairs. It can be frustrating for little hands trying to place these figures on the chairs only to have them fall off. Most of the time baby and daddy are watching tv while mommy is in the kitchen making monkey bread....what imaginations they have! Thanks for a fun learning experience."
4,great for toddlers but needs more accessories,"Disappointed that some of the accessories have to be purchased but overall it's great for our 1.5 year old. We got it early for the holidays and paid 29.00. Came online today Dec 23rd to find accessories and noticed it now for over 50!!! I dont think I would pay 50 for it though. The accessories that it comes with aside from three dolls are a potty, a kitchen, a dinner table and two chairs. The baby gets no highchair and there are no beds for mom and dad and no crib for baby. These have to be purchased from the accessories set. Annoyingly, the baby crib is not part of the mom and dad bedroom set. Something to keep in mind. Cant really rate it for playing as this is a Christmas gift."
3,For What It's Worth,"What's that song? Something happened here. What it is ain't exactly clear?If you observe Owen's Ann Rule rule (No Peaking at the pictures in the middle until the suspect(s) are identified in the text,) and also reserve the spoiler-laden Intro, Acknowledgements and cover until after The End, then this True Crime saga reads like a taut fictional murder mystery - until The End that is no End.Who murdered 2 Dartmouth Profs on Super Bowl Saturday, 2001? Why? In due time, author Eric Francis supplies the ""Who?"" But, due to publishing before the conclusion of legal proceedings, the reader of his book will be left wanting for ""Why?"" This reader had to get that off Google - who sent me to Court TV - for free. Reviewed by TundraVision"
4,Average Iron,"This is your typical iron -- I think it has all the minimum requirements for an iron these days. Lots of settings, auto turn off, etc . . ."
1,Avoid this model,"I will say up front, we have the AS-185 instead of an AS-175, but check the reservoir fill on this model!! It is a COMPLETE pain in the backside!!Turkey baster, syringe, NOTHING is convenient to insert water into this puppy.We've had it less than a year, there is a part of the handle that is peeling back for some reason and, it may have been our fault, but it's already leaking out the footplate and at the base. No matter if it's horizontal or vertical. We haven't consistently used tap water or distilled water, so I can't say if that didn't contribute to the leakage.We did like the size of the footplate and the steam shot. I did not like the inability to store the cord around the iron in any fashion."
5,An epic book,"The other reviews sum up this book very well. It is a compelling tale of survival in the most horrendous of circumstances, of which ""The Killing Fields"" gives only a small glimpse. I felt changed by the book. It's hard to look at state-sponsored torture in the same light after you read it. And it's hard to grasp man's inhumanity to man on such a vast scale."
3,Falters after the first half,"This book started off with a bang. The events of 1975 Cambodia are covered well with a lot of interesting observations. The enforcers of the Khmer Rouge, it seems, were mainly children with automatic weapons.The atrocities, lies and horrible conditions that the people of Cambodia faced at the hands of the ""liberators"" are described in detail, sometimes lurid.However, the author went on a little too far spending many pages talking about life after scooting out of the troubled country."
5,A Great Song,"I think this song is brill, people say you get sick of a song after a while but you will not get sick of this song."
1,"The most frustrating, useless, agrevating product I've seen.","DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.It's as simple as that. I bought this product to use on a European Vacation. It arrived the day before I flew, and was utterly useless. I'm just about to send it right back to the supplier.GPS Systems are meant to take 5 - 15 minutes to locate themselves on first try. This took OVER AN HOUR.On 2nd try, they are meant to pinpoint their locations very fast. I left this GPS system outside under clear view of the sky for over 20 MINUTES, and after that time it hadn't even managed to get a lock on ONE SINGLE SATELLITE.I'm not sure if the antenna is just to small, or what the problem is, but it is completely unusable.Don't waste your time, or money. Buy something else instead."
4,Almost Perfect!,"I've puchased Garmin cfQue1620 for my vacation trip from Philadelphia, PA to Toronto, Canada and back via NY City. I've used this unit with my Axim X5 (400 MHz running under MS PPC 2003).The unit worked fine, with few hickups; while routing to the hotel that I was planning to stay in Niagara Falls (Canadian side) it was directing us to a special bridge on the river that only special card holders are allowed to pass (perhaps Garmin people will fix these issues when they hear these hickups from users). The second hickup occured in Toronto where the unit missed the exit that we supposed to take for shore destination (perhaps I was driving a little fast comparing with US standard ;-)...). Nevertheless, I'm very happy with this purchase and wouldn't leave my home for such a trip without cfQue 1620, good job Garmin!"
2,Incompatible with a Dell Axim X51,"I purchased this unit with great expectations and was greatly disappointed with it and had to return it. Garmin is a great company (I have had a handheld unit for several years), and I had great service with their technical support, but the bottom line is that the unit was forever ""acquiring satellites"" and when it would finally find a few, the screen would blink and they would all disappear and it would start all over again. Garmin technical support did acknowledge that there were some compatibility issues with some Dell Axim models. I tried the ActiveSync patch mentioned on the web, but it made no difference. I think that the design is fine and it probably works well on other PDAs, but if you have an Axim X51, don't waste your time with this one."
2,Not for newer Pocket PCs,"Well, I love the design of this unit, and the Garmin navigation software is fantastic, but there's a huge catch. It won't work with newer Pocket PCs. According to an email I received from tech support at Garmin: ""unfortunately the Garmin CF Que 1620 is only designed to work with Pocket PC 2003 and does not work well, if at all, with the Window Mobile 5 operating systems"". Sooo, if you have an older PPC, I'd say go for it, but if you're on WM5, and you want a Garmin unit, take a look at the GPS 10 (a bluetooth GPS module)."
1,Received a Faulty CF 1620 Que,I received a Faulty CF 1620 !!Sometimes works and most of the time get Frozen .I have an Ipaq 2495 with it and it works Randomly.Very dissapointed with this Product !!Jose Quintero
3,Uncomfortably funny...,"3.5 star. This is definitely a dark comedy. You feel like a jerk for laughing, but laugh nonetheless ! This is a unique movie that keeps you entertained throughought . The characters are interesting and the actors do a great job."
1,I don't get it.,"I didn't understand the point of this movie... unless it's meant to be an indictment of the Korean university system since the central character, a worthless, sociopathic loser, bribes his way into a professorship. There's only one likable character in the movie, a young woman who tries to do the right thing. Her only vice is wanting recognition, and her efforts to help people cause her to lose her job.The whole thing plays like a student film. A bunch of odd characters and odd situations with a story that goes nowhere. Lots of detail and no insight. Very static and not at all funny."
1,Dont even bother.,"I've watched many bad movies and this one is up there with the worst movie ever made. I cant even explain it, its just bad. The dark humor, the pace, the acting, the overall script is BAD, BAD, BAD. I cant say enough. This movie is not for animal lovers. If you dont find humor in hanging a dog, throwing it off a roof, or even chopping it up for food....this movie is definitely NOT for you."
5,Squeaky Clean!,I love this shampoo! I broke down and decided to try it the other night because the water here in afghanistan is horrible! I must say that this shampoo made my hair feel sqeaky clean! It felt like months of build-up had been washed away! I am totally hooked and will be using this stuff for the rest of this deployment. Just be sure that you use a good moisterizing conditioner after using this shampoo.
1,The show is rigged!!!,"I rented Season 1 on DVD from Netflix hoping to learn something about business. I came away convinced that the show was rigged. One of the contestants lay down and took a nap while the rest of his team was hard at work on a challenge. Instead of firing the lazy bum Donald promoted him to team leader the next week. Next one of the constestants lost almost $200 of the team's money. Instead of firing her, she was also promoted to team leader the next week. I can't possibly imagine that he would put up with that sort of nonsense from one of his real employees. I think that the only reason he kept either of them was because their teammates hated them and the constant fighting caused a lot of drama which, of course, improved the show's ratings."
5,I LOVE THE APPRENTICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The Apprentice is my favorite show in the whole world, and I can't wait for it to come on tonight. I am so excited, since i don't have school tomorrow. IF u want to buy this DVD, don't buy it here, buy it at Sams. Sams rocks.(...)"
5,Addicting as can be!,"I received this set for Christmas a couple years ago, right after season 2 had finished. I pretty much watched all 24 or so episodes all the way through! It was so addicting it kept me from sleeping because at the end of each show, as the door slammed shut, I knew I just had to see what happened next. Let them come out with the other seasons on DVD. I would purchase them without a thought!"
5,One of the best entertaining shows ever...,"I'm usually not into reality tv shows (never watched one for more than one episode) however, when i started watching the apprentice i immediately became addicted to it. It is by far the best reality show ever created. Not only its entertaining but most importantly, its educational. It gives the viewers a chance to see and experience secondhand many aspects of many types of businesses and how people from different backgrounds work together (or not)...Also, Trump shares so much of his knowledge in doing business that just those insights are enough reason to buy this dvd...Highly recommended!!"
4,Apprentice Who,"I bought this product for a business training program. Many of our associates where not aware of the winner and what his business message offers. This product was great as a learning tool with an added bonus of ""no commercials""."
2,Too materialistic,The scripts were not that interesting. Parts were very interesting. Too materialistic. Trump is a good business man but doesn't seem to have an idea of what lies beyond material riches because he gives so much importance to a gold house and superficial toys. Who cares about owning a helicopter.
4,For the love of money,"Great addictive show, with Donald Trump winnowing down 16 competitors to one, who will work for him and learn important business advice.The show is greatly helped by interesting casting, of odd (Omarosa, Tammy, Sam) and endearing (Troy, Kwame, Bill) personalities. Each episode finds the competitors battling each other in a business-related task. The losers face the Boardroom and being fired.The DVD includes several featurettes, a bizarre music video and a preview of ""The Apprentice 2"", with casting interviews for the 18 new contestants. The box cover opens and an audio chip inside has Trump saying ""You're fired."" It's cute, but I'm sure will get annoying fast.One problem is they apparently couldn't get the rights to the theme song - The O'Jay's ""For The Love of Money."" So instead of that, there's a blandly generic song that is out-of-place with the flashy credits."

5,007 Role Players Handbook (Basic Game Book),"I first came upon this book in 1987. And almost twenty years later, I'm reading and going through it over and over again. The Basic Game Book is a manual of the workings of a James Bond role playing world and it's core rules. It is a RPG along the same lines of Dungeons and Dragons.This book is not not only informative and insightful but the artwork is great as well. It is concise and very organized and structured when explaining how to bring the world of 007 to life. Whether you are a 007 fan or not, if you want to role play in the world of international espionage, this is the book for you."
5,Great fun and great read!,"This book has all the info on getting yourself into the world of James Bond! well wriiten, nicely laid out along with great art work!"
4,Other Books,"A good change of pace game, designed to give broad brush style cinematic adventures, and allow escaps from impossible situations."
2,She should have stopped with the Velvets,"As a member of the Velevt Underground, singing some of the songs, she was a welcome addition. She brought an interesting facet to their stripped down, rudimentary sound.As a solo artist, her brooding, dire approach to the vocals is way too much to take.I hate her cover of ""The End"". Ironically, that is my favorite Doors song. With the Doors, that song is existential, emotional, cerebral, evocative. With Nico, it's grating.Listening to song after song gets too depressing. Where do you listen to this...in a funeral home?If she wasn't so attractive and alluring would she really have had any solo career?"
5,The Emperor has no clothes!,"I love listening to Nico. But the fact is she had no real talent, couldn't carry a tune, and was a laughably pompous ""artiste."" An IBM computer mimicing Greta Garbo, indeed! Nico was like William Shatner, but without the self-awareness. Over the top funny and foolish! ""Janitor of Lunacy"" -- give me a break! But, buy this CD!"
4,Nico wafers,"Nico, the German chanteuse, recorded with now considered seminal rock faves, Velvet Underground in the late 1960's and had the deep uninterested vocals that seem so decadent and thrilling in the re-evaluation. At the time, she was. at best, thought of as an Andy Warhol experiment and tossed aside like all tomorrows parties.This CD is a fine rebuke to those who confuse her life with her art.Her breathy, dramatic readings, (can't quite call it singing), are evocative and sensuous in a way that would influence such fans as Jane Oliver, latter day Marianne Faithfull, and Diana Krall.Best on this CD is the Jackson Browne ""These Days"", the VU clips, and the few songs from her weirdly romantic solo LP, ""Chelsea Girl"", esp. the Lou Reed title song."
5,femme fatale,"""She is beautiful, and in a world where so much can easily be possessed on a whim or for a promise, she is unpossessable. She has a clear, pure ring, a trueness, like an arrow that has hit an inner mark and can't be wedged loose."" -pat patterson""Nico was a new type of female superstar. Baby Jane and Edie were both outgoing, American, social, bright, excited, chatty, whereas Nico was weird and untalkative. You'd ask her something and she'd maybe answer you five minutes later. When people described her, they used words like memento mori or macabre. She wasn't the type to get up on the table and dance, the way Edie and Baby Jane might; in fact, she'd rather hide under the table than dance on it. She was mysterious and European, a real moon goddess type.""-warholthis compilation is half light, half dark, with most of the dark being original songs written by nico. i prefer the earlier songs, as im sure you will."
3,"Not the best collection of her work, BUT....","Nico's albums sound like absolutely nothing released in the last 25 years. For the critics I rebut, that few if any artists of the time were even remotely as Original and Authentic as NICO. Buy her individuals albums, rather than this dim-witted posthumous sampler."
3,Let's be honest,"The production/recording quality leaves alot to be desired, the songs are campy and unoriginal, the subject matter is more of a vehical to popularize the Rice/Webber team, and of all the ""controversial"" albums of the late 60's/early 70's this one is blatently commercial. The only thing going for this album is Ian Gillan.But over 30 years later, I still got these songs playin' in my head!"
3,this one is okay,"this recording of jesus christ superstar is okay, (...). Ian Gillian does not play a good Jesus.If i were you, i would get the new 2001 cast recording than this one"
1,"Jesus, save me!","...Wasn't one crucfixion enough? Did Rice and Weber have to do it all over again with what remainds a really embarrassing piece of junk!!!? Anyone associated with this with a shred of self-respect is now in hiding, ashamed to show their faces in public. The only thing I ever heard that was worse than this is (and I kid you not!) ""The Naked Carmen"" and thankfully that disappeared from the market almost on release. If Jesus heard this drivel, he'd turn atheist!"
5,Great rock opera by any standards,"This version of Jesus Christ Superstar is easily one of the best rock operas ever created. I feel that it competes with ""Quadrophenia"" by The Who (which is better than ""Tommy"") and ""The Wall"" by Pink Floyd. I am personally not a very religious person and could care less about the significance of this album to the Christian community. It is simply a great musical composition with a very talented and emotional group of vocalists. It is well written and presents an interesting interpretation of the familiar story. If you are a fan of classic rock (esp. early 70s) give this a listen. I will be surprised if you are disappointed."
4,The Original,"I agree with some of the other reviewer that the sound quality is not the best on this CD, but you owe it to yourself to listen to the recording that started the phenomenon of Super Christ Superstar at least once."
1,Where is it printed what version this is ?,"My player reads "" Movie "" songs not what I remeber at all, The song "" Everything is Allright "" has no singing"
3,Skips a little,I love the music and enjoy the CD overall - but it does skip a little in one song. Other than that it is ok.
2,Jesus Christ Superstar CD,The product arrived as advertised but the quality of the disc was inferior which was very disapppointing. I own an album but it had gotten scatchy over time and after seeing the show in person decided to get the disc. Very uneven sound . It made me think it was reproduced in China. It was not cheap either. The quality in the old album I have is much higher although scratchy.
2,Jesus Christ Superstar-Is it worth it?,"I am currently taking part in a school production of JSC, and am particularly enjoying it as the pit band make the songs sound so powerful. I don't mean to be blunt, but i don't at all find the Cd soundtrack as appealing. If you like the songs, I suggest you go and see it live, as the CD doesn't do the fantastic songs much justice"
4,Jesus Christ Superstar,"There are a few songs that skip a little, not very noticeable though. Could be a malfunction on my part. Also the CD case was cracked when I got it. Otherwise it's a great CD. Oh, and I didn't realize I'd be paying almost $33. It originally started out at 24.99. If I knew it was going to be $33. I would have waited until I got to a bigger city with a Best Buy."
3,So So,No great shakes. About the same as Money 2001!!! I just wanted software new enough to store backup files some where other than a floppy drive.
1,MS Money 2004,"Did not work with my Windows XP Dell computer. Very disatisfied with this product. Would not recommend you get this, instead was able to reuse my Money 1995 software with minor issues."
5,surprisingly easy!!,"Very easy to work with - no problems - product ordered, confirmed price and shipping and received shipment ahead of schedule."
5,a wonderful balance,"What a great way with music and words. I find his music and lyrics to be its own way-full of eclectic style, sound and soul. His music seems to be a reflection of fluid life and vivacity. Simply put, one of my favorite musicians. Cheers."
1,Don't waste your money - I'll give you my copy,This webpage said that if I like Jack Johnson or Donavon Frankenreiter I might like Jon Swift. WRONG!Sound like John Denver or maybe some Christian High School kid with marginal talent.
5,night only,i love this cd i make copy of it in my cd burn and my friend i love it to please if like bee gee get this one
2,I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE IT!,I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE IT BARRY ROBIN MAURICE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER!I DIDN'T LIKE THE SONGS ON THERE EITHER!FROM A BIG BEE GEES FAN KIRSTEN
3,nothing special,"the bee gees recognition was long over due by this point, but this album really isnt the one to bring the media crawling. this is not a bad album but its nothing special. there are several great songs on this but so many of them are linger on and on. the album cover is neat, its packed with stuff to look at. the album ""size isnt everything"" is a huge step up after this one. the best song on here would have to be ""SECRET LOVE"" its another sweet tender hearted song that these guys are known for.overall, its nothing special, but its not horrible"
5,Terrific guide for understanding Muslim culture!,"My husband is from Morocco, and we both love this book. It has helped me understand my family and friends from Morocco with less conflict. Invaluable for travelers or friends of Moroccans or even other Middle Eastern cultures. I have given it to several friends who were planning to travel or live in Northern Africa."
5,Enlightening & Invaluable,"Having lived in Morocco for two and a half years without the benefit of Hargraves' knowledge, I can attest to its usefulness. I read the book upon my return to the States, and our author is right on the mark with every sentence. Additionally, Hargraves doesn't simply tell us how things are over there in that magical land, but he goes as far as to tell us why they are so. Read this book before leaving for Morocco. You will be all the richer and better-equipped for it. I suppose it just goes to show that one can never doubt the worth of a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer's experience"
2,Not even close to his best,... While this CD has some bright spots try and buy WA instead. That is the only other Akira CD I own and is leaps and bounds better than this. I own about 15 Loudness CD's and all of those are better than this. I would like to own other solo Cds but they are hard to find... Only get this CD if you are a die hard Akira fan.
2,Not Akira's best work,I first heard Loudness in the mid 80's and saw them in concert once.I was completely taken by the extreme talent and scope of Akira Takaski's playing.I own Tusk Of Jaguar and Wa and they are great CD's.However Made In Hawaii really falls short.There are a few moments of brilliance here but overall avoid this CD.The production seems muddy and uneven throughout this disc.Akira is a fine guitarist and fair bassist but he should leave the drumming to another.The vocals could be clearer too.I give this 2 stars and hope his next offering showcases his gifts better.
3,Could Have Been Better,"This CD could have been somewhat better.It's missing some of his other hits.Such as ""Your Love Is A Miracle"",""I Just Wanted You To Know"" and ""She Dreams"". This collection should've had at least 14 tracks.I would say,just pass this up and get his ""Top Marks"" CD.It's an import,but you can still get it on Amazon.It's alot better than this.It's got his first 20 singles on one disc.Get that instead.You'll be glad you did.Trust me."
2,"Should Have Been Called ""Some Greatest Hits""","This is a lousy ""Greatest Hits"" compilation. It fails to include the #1 I Just Wanted You Know, #3 Your Love Is A Miracle, among other top 5-10 hits meaning you'll still have to go through and buy the rest of the albums to truely have ""the greatest hits"". All together, Id say its missing about 6 tracks needed to be a true ""Greatest Hits"". It does include a couple of new songs and one is pretty good which is the only reason I can give this album two stars instead of one."
2,Not the strongest collection ..................,"I'm new to Mark Chesnutt, and I bought this thinking I would like at least a few songs. But the only one I like is ""Goin' Through The Big D"". I've read that he's had a lot of hits that are not here, so I guess I'll just have to keep looking.When I looked at his Millennium Collection album, I noticed ""The Big D"" is not on it. How can that be? Both these cds have plenty of empty space for more songs. And what does it say about record company decision makers? Are they just slicing and dicing, making you buy more than one collection? Surely they wouldn't do that ??"
4,Drawing you in,"This calendar is absolutely beautiful! Paul Rezendes' photographs draw in the eye and lead the mind to a place of introspection. He captures color and pattern in nature that sparks insight. I agree totally with the calendar's back panel blurb: ""Nature's Mirror: The Art of Zen 2001 makes the natural world a visual metaphor to spark understanding and personal transformation.""Each month is accompanied by a poem from Japan, China or Korea which reflects and adds to the mood of the photo. The grid is large with lots of white space for writing. Major Christian and Jewish holidays along with civil holidays for the United States, Canada and the U.K. are indicated along with moon phases and solar equinoxes and solstices.My one desire would be that the calendar also included holidays for other religions such as Wicca, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism."
5,Essential Political Philosophy,This is the source. Strauss and Cropsey certainly have compiled the authoritative reference for political philosophy. This is great for beginners and also seasoned scholars. There is a chapter on just about any philosopher you could imagine in here. Clearly-written essays provide for a greater understanding of each one.
4,"Good, but just a starting point","This book is 171 pages, but much of the space is used by cartoons which don't add much content, so the amount of actual text in the book is rather limited. Since consciousness is a complex and difficult subject (maybe THE fundamental subject), the small extent of the book makes it, at best, only a good preliminary starting point. Fortunately, that's exactly what the book is, since Papineau knows his subject well and makes efficient use of the few words available to him.If you want to start by dipping your toes in the water, this book should work well for you. However, if you're ready to earnestly dive in, perhaps after reading this book first, you will need to read something considerably more substantial. In other words, if you have even a moderately serious interest in this subject, you will outgrow this book quickly."
4,Looking for a way to cut some wedding costs,I like many other brides out there had a budget that I HAD to stick to no matter what. I don't come from money and I wasn't marrying into it either. So when looking around at bridal books on tips and ideas I came across this one and hoped it to be everything it states on the front of it. The books itself is not too bad. It has many tips for ways to cut costs or avoid them all together. I mean some of it is common sense like making alot of your own things and well if you have a year to plan a wedding you may have time to do just that. I bought it used pretty cheap and it's not a bad guide to have if you are planning a wedding. Just don't buy it if you don't have alot of time to invest in the wedding because having a cheaper wedding requires alot of time and effort on the bride's part. I know:)
5,"""The Suicidal Embrace"" is a major book in European history","Professor Beisel's ""Suicidal Embrace"" is a major book in European history and a model for the study of history in general. It is first rate. I recommend it, without reservation, to my colleagues and I have assigned it in two different college courses."
1,Not the hobby standard,"This claims to be an accurate price guide to US stamps, but it's not the one used by the vast majority of stamp collectors. If you want something that's more widely accepted, try the Scott catalogs. The Scott Specialized catalog for US stamps is THE standard catalog and price guide. Scott numbers and prices will give you a much better idea about the value of your stamps than this will. Most public libraries have a copy of Scott, and there is also a smaller, cheaper pocket edition."
2,"Stings a little,","This was a bit irritating on my skin, and although it did seem to raise the wrinkles and make them ""tighter"" i often felt a slight itchiness or redness."
5,great for birthday parties,"I bought this for my son's birthday party. We of course had a dinosaur theme, and while I had other games and activities, all dinosaur related, this was the only one that had them completely engrossed. The parents started arriving while the kids were just finishing up and the kids wouldn't leave until every single piece of rock was broken up. They absolutely loved it. I bought two sets for twelve kids, luckily they were on sale at the time. Make sure you set firm ground rules, like no bopping each other on the head, and they must must must wear the glasses. We had sooo much fun, I highly recommend this for any occasion."
4,Hohner CX-12,"I am a shut-in Grandmother who started to fiddle around with a $3.00 harmonica I purchased for my grandchildren, and realized how much fun I was having. A friend suggested I get a Hohner Chromatic and the prices were more than I could afford. I noticed a used Honer CX-12 for a very reasonalbe price and snapped it up. This is a real live insturment! It sounds great! I am learning from ""Harmoncia's for Dummies"" and slowly picking up my skills. I have a little background with violin and piano, but most of all I am having a ball making music with an instrument that only requires lung power. It's ability to play chords is great! I may never master such a wonderful instrument, but I surely am going to enjoy the time I spend with it. So far, I led the family in Christmas Carols and they all got into the swing of it. I never realized this little instrument that almost fits into my pocket could bring me such joy! Thanks to Amazon the price was right! A great challange for the over 70 group!"
1,A Frustrating Experience,"I bought Hohner CX-12 as a Christmas gift for myself. The package showed up at my door within a few days of time much to my delight. However, I wasn't so pleased once the package was opened. First, harmonica box has no seal, someone could have played it before me. 2nd, instrument is hardly playable, the slide button was completely stuck. When I try to return or exchange a better one, I was told the state and federal regulation prohibit to return mouth piece music instrument, I don't recall seeing this regulation posted anywhere when I buy it (perhaps I missed it?). I must say it was most frustrating experience in my amazon shopping, not to mention it's for Christmas. For anyone who considers buying mouth piece music instrument, be very careful please."
2,"Ok, but not great",I was not satisfied with this product. The sound and quality are poor for the price.
3,"Nice Collection, Lots Of Music",It should be easy to tell from the movies and TV shows listed whether or not you'd be interested in this collection. I'm a fan of Elfman's (in the soundtrack sense) so I liked this but there was so much music and the range is so broad that I didn't love it. this is one of those CDs that I had to make my own compilation from so I could listen to just the parts I liked without skipping around too much.
4,Hey - it's Ella!,"OK, none of Ella's greatest hits are here. OK, there are no great names on the bandstand with Ella. So what. The band is certainly capable, and Ella, as always, is delightful. Her voice is as sweet and soulful as ever, and you get a tremendous sense of her ability as an entertainer. Even when she forgets the words to a song, her musicianship shines as she scats and improvises her way out of the jam. If you've got some other recordings by her, you will want this one. If you don't, buy it anyway -- it will pique your interest. If you like great jazz singing, you cannot go wrong with a mature live performance by one of the greatest jazz singers -- and artists -- of all time."
3,daughter is happy,"We received the bike in a box in front of our doorstep. If you want this to be a suprise for your daughter then you will need to be careful because you will know it is a groovy girl bike by looking at the box. Most of the bike was already put together. Assembly required for the front wheel, training wheels, seat, handle bars and the front brake needed adjustment. Powder coat paint finish arrived with many dings in it. The box was pretty beat up when it arrived. Overall, the bike arrived on time and our daughter is extremely happy with it. She does not care about the stuff we noticed."
4,Satisfied so far!,"I bought this bike for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves it. It was delivered as stated, my husband had no trouble putting it together and she loves the groovy girl graphics. So far we are very satisfied with this product but she hasn't ridden it a whole lot so I can't attest to its durability."
4,Wonderfull,At least its not all piano songs like some cd's that i bought.This compilation of songs will raise the hairs on your arms at somepoint... They are all pretty good.The more i hear Richard Rodgers compositions the more i can see thatthis person was quite a musical genius....Excellent.
4,Teaches all of us the meaning of understanding.,The book opens with a overview of color. This may seem odd to most but the use of color for changing mood and perception have been proven methods in mind altering. Be aware of how the people you care about change. This is not such a bad thing if you understand the reason behind what they seem mad at. In short the first chapter covers the colors in our minds. The second chapter opens with meditation and achieving the goals you set by programing yourself to respond better to your commands. You begin to take control of your body through thought. You feel your own body as if it were an actual part of you. The experience is one that must be had. You begin to see life through a different window. Your outlook on life becomes clear and your goals become more focused. Believe me this book will help you become more of what you already are. Tap into yourself and see what it holds for you.
5,WARM UP THAT SWEET THING WITH CK & RUFUS!,"For years a $$$ import for Chaka Khan fans but now The Very Best Of Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan has been issuedby MCA. All the hits that propelled Rufus into orbit as one of the best 'crossover' Soul bands are here and these are just someof the examples set that shot Chaka off onto her own on-going successful solo career. Unfortunately for Rufus, after Chakajumped ship Rufus sank after 2 unsuccessful albums. But as they say 'the music plays on' and this CD is packed with tunes thatare still 'radio staples'and club hits around the globe to this day. The sonics are amazing and you can hear clearer & brighterthan ever before. The bass pops and Chaka is especially a turn on! Just listen to her moan, coo & scream on ""Tell MeSomething Good,"" ""Do You Love What You Feel"" & ""Sweet Thing"" for pre-warmup action. Get the message? O.K. now getthe CD and warm up your own SWEET THING... Chaka style!"
5,The Very Best of Rufus & Chaka Khan - CD,This is a very good CD. Has many of the songs I was looking for. I would highly recommend this for anyone who if a fan of Rufus & Chaka Khan!
4,Awesome but too brief,"This straight reissue of the 1982 collection has no surprise choices in its linep. All ten tracks were top 10 R & B hits. Be it the oh-so funky ""Tell Me Something Good"" and ""You Got The Love"" or dance floor fillers like ""At Midnight (My Love Will Lift You Up)"" and ""Once You Get Started,"" touching tales such as ""Hollywood"" and ""Please Pardon Me"" or the steamy ballads ""Stay"" and ""Sweet Thing,"" all of the enclosed tracks are great.My only complaint is that this collection did not offer more tracks when it was reissued on CD - in particular the lush ""Sharing The Love"" (their only other top ten hit). With first rate musicianship and a stellar lead vocalist in Chaka Khan, this set is long enough however to show why Rufus was one of the top bands of the '70s. Also, that they were far more than just Khan's launching pad."
5,Chaka and Rufus- Nuff Said,"This CD is very good for those of us who got into appreciating Chaka late (as I did as a lil kid when she came out with the remake of ""I Feel For You"" in 1984). My favorites are ""Hollywood"" and ""Stay"" which happen to be back to back on the CD. If you are looking for the hits from Rufus and Chaka U can't go wrong with this CD at all. Very much recommend. ""Once You Get Started"" with this CD I also recommend for you to check out the group's 1979 CD ""Masterjam"" which is off the chain and comes STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
1,waste of money,"this hose has a life of its own - never lays down flat, always coils up. only thing right about it is the length - 25'!!"
4,Frankland does a good job,"Frankland did a cursory job in his biography of Arthur. His exploits in Egypt under General Garnet Wolsey were not as in depth as I would have liked, but did a good job in his relationship with Queen Victoria. Arthur lived through some of the most turbulent times in Britain and Frankland did an admirable job in bringing those events with the aspect of Arthur in them. If someone is an Anglophile or even more so a fan of royalty or Queen victoria then they will enjoy Frankland's biography"
5,"Great, in-depth news reporting of the revolution","For those interested in the details of how the Baltic republics broke free of Soviet domination, this book, written by a knowledgeable Brit, reads fast, like an extended news report, and gives details I never found covered in the daily press during the actual events. I recommend it."
4,Only oscar,"Only oscar g and his posse of wonderfull artists could make such an album. I heard it and could not believe it. It blew my mind so much, that it almost got five stars, but only got four. Eventhough it was exceptional I have heard better. All in all, it is a great album at a great price. If any of you like oscar or are into rave style music, I suggest you buy it and buy it now."
5,Excellent Book with Great Service,This book is excellent for students in grades 2 and higher. The words can get very complex and I like the choices. I would recommend this book to a teacher that has high 2nd graders and beyond. Best for grades 3-6.
2,Last good album,"This one's got great groove,amazing production,beautiful vocals(of course),and for my money,was the last really strong effort from the Gibbs--the album punked out here in North America,but overseas it kicked ass."
5,WOW,"I had this album on cassette & was thrilled to find the CD. I love the BeeGees and plan to complete my collection here on Amazon. This album has nothing but terrific songs on it. The band of brothers is at their best from ""You Win Again"" to ""Backtafunk""."
3,"UN ALBUM INTERESANTE, QUE VALE LA PENA TENER","Este album que marca el retorno de los Bee Gees, es una mezcla de estilos, entre el pop, funky y los románticos. Si bien tuvo relativo éxito, destacan ""E.S.P."" donde Robin se luce, ""You win Again"" y ""Overnight"" el cual considero como el mejor tema que ha interpretado Maurice en su carrera. Lo recomiendo de todas maneras......."
1,Dull,"It contains one of their best songs in You Win Again, but the rest is a waste of time and money."
4,Bee Gees Win Again!,"The title track of E.S.P. opens the album with a terrific energy, and beautifully sets up the the second track, ""You Win Again"", to completely bowl the listener over. ""Giving Up the Ghost"" is also wonderfully upbeat, with a great lead vocal by Robin. ""Crazy For Your Love"" is a great dance number, and the funky ""This Is Your Life"" always makes me giggle a little - the guys samply their own music - and sound totally unlike themselves. There are beautiful ballads as well (""Live or Die"", ""Angela"")."
4,Dreamy 80s Pop,"My favorite songs on this CD are ""You Win Again,"" ""Giving Up the Ghost,"" and ""The Longest Night."" The first two are sprighty, dance infectious and lively. ""The Longest Night"" is Robin at his best -- clean, clear voice, and Barry and Maurice provide wonderful background harmonies. The instrumental arrangement is jazzy, unlike typical Bee Gees tunes. The song strongly reminded me of Bobby Caldwell during his 1980s phase before he began concentrating on the American Songbook. This BG song would not be out of place on a ""quiet storm"" radio station. Well done, lads."
2,nobody's perfect,"E.S.P. is the only Bee Gees Cd that was a letdown. The title tract is excellent, as are 'Longest Night' (Robin on lead) and 'Overnight'(an excellent lead by Mo). I realize that 'You Win Again' was a big international hit, but I dislike the intro so much that I skip the track altogether (I also realize most Bee Gee fans would disagree). Whatever the reason, E.S.P. just didn't resonate, just wasn't what is usually delivered by these master craftsmen.However, the three quality tracks mentioned are really strong, and for that reason E.S.P.is a worthwhile purchase."
3,"""You Win Again"" is the best here....","I was pleased that the BG's returned to glory (in the U.K. at least) with ""You Win Again"" a #1 hit in the U.K. It's a great song, and the highlight of this CD.A little too over-produced for me. Too many electronic touches and overdubs (Yes, it was 1987, but, it really drowns the songs in noise.)There's trademark falsetto all over this album. Sometimes it's, in my view, too much. It destroys track 3 ""Live or Die (Hold Me Like A Child)"" which, for me, would have been a great song without it.And...some songs run just too long.That said, there's still BG's brilliance here. I love ""Overnight"" and ""Backtafunk"". And, of course, ""You Win Again."""
4,OSTs appropriate for binge drinkers!,"For those interested in all cinematic things, Steve Buscemi, check out the soundtrack recording to his directorial debut, post-Reservoir Dogs, post-Pulp Fiction, and everything else this indie acting king went through!*Alcoholic beverages optional here...!"
5,A view of Disney,This is a treasure for anyone who is a hiddeen Mickey Freak. Lots of Disney behind the scenes triva. This book gives you much to look out for when you make your trip to the Magic Kingdom.
5,Interesting history,"The title ""What Would Walt Do"" is catchy and creates curiosity. When learning it is about experiences while building Disney World, one is anxious to read it. It is written in an easy-to-read format and I found I could not put it down once I started to read it. The author, D.M. Miller, was able to put me right on site as this wonderful project came to life."
2,Really an autobiography about the author - not about WD,"The book was an easy read BUT was really an autobiography of the author and his life. It's about his working days, especially while working on the constrction of WDW. Besides the very infrequent mention of the title ""What Would Walt Do"" there was next to nothing in the book about Walt's philosophies, work ethic and thought processes. Not what I exptected or what the title infers."
1,Well... what would Walt do?,"""What Would Walt Do"" has very little to do with the design and contruction of Disney World and more to do the author's personal remembrances of his career. Fully three-quarters of this short book deals with the author's personal history outside of Disney World. All of the information found here dealing with Disney World can be found elsewhere in more detail. I do not recommend this book."
1,Skip This One,A very short book. No pictures. Lots of fluff. Information about the author that has nothing to do with Walt Disney takes up pages in the book. Stories about mean foremen and inspectors. Boring.What would Walt do? He'd do it right no matter what the expense. There. Save your money and buy a good book on Disney.
3,Where Total Quality Management May Have Started,"I enjoyed this book from the standpoint of learning how projects such as Disneyworld test all of the construction processes to ensure safety. I read this just as the Israel ballroom where a wedding dance was being held collapsed this weekend and was startled to see the first people they arrested (immediately!) were the contractor and chief engineer!The author's assertion that Walt Disney would have nothing but the best, at any cost of time and money, shows why Disneyworld was selected by Tom Peters for his work on ""In Search of Excellence"". I.E., excellence starts at the bottom and trickles up....P>As the author states in the beginning, this was just ""a little book"" about his experiences with the project, and I found it to deliver that story in an unassuming manner. I loved the working man anecdotes!"
4,Interesting history,"Again, I wrote this book but you asked me to review it. Honestly, I think the book has too much about me and needs to have more about Walt Disney. I plan to rewrite it some day."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was pleasantly surprised by this short book. (Though I first thought that the author ""D. Miller"" was Dianne Miller, Walt's daughter. It's not her) Anyway, Mr. Miller fondly re-counts his life and how it led to him working on the construction of W.D.W.It's a print on demand book and has no photos but that didn't detract from the book for me. Disney expects payment up front for use of photos of their properties and most would be authors simply don't have that kind of money. Some of the stories are mentioned in other books, other stories are only mentioned here. So go ahead, give Mr. Millers book a read."
2,Give me more story!,"I was a bit disappointed in the book only from an aspect of wanting to know more about the actual construction and issues that faced Walt Disney World's inception from drawing board to amusement legend. The book is a decent read and does provide some insight into the construction of the park, but has more of the author's personal story than is assumed by the title. Overall, the book is not a real indepth story about the design of the park; a good biography of a person connected with the construction, but not so much about the design and impact of Walt's legacy."
1,Poorly mastered product from Collectables,"The shoddy work that is synonymous with Collectables product is all too apparent with the horrible sound quality in these digital transfers. ""Baby, Let's Wait"", for example, is poorly mixed stereo with the left channel jacked up so much that the high and low ends are lost, replaced with static.This is just one example of a persistent problem with this collection. Save your money and look at lovingly crafted compilations from Ace Records and/or Eric."
1,Same old line....,"In this series of books, the author attempts to point out pitfalls of various groups and sects. Ankerberg takes aim at the Word of Faith and ""parrots"" all of the old verbage heretofore stated without any other insight. The book quotes various teachers but the size of the book does not allow a fair and accurate treatment of the Faith message as a whole. If people would judge the Faith message or any message by the Word instead of by their favorite preacher, they would be a lot better off."
1,Many errors,"This book has some problems. Like many others, John talks about things without knowing all of the facts. Hagin, Copeland, Price, etc... have gotten a bad rap. In fact, most true Christians would be considered herectics if you examined ALL of their doctrine. This is unfair and sad."
2,A broken record,"I read this for a book club, I wouldn't have finished it otherwise. That it won a Pulitzer made me think, incorrectly, it would improve. Cesar is not an appealing character. He makes love to an unending stream of women, but doesn't know how to love any of them. He sings songs of love but doesn't know how to talk to a woman. The sex is nonstop---graphic but not salacious, somewhat clinical. You can open the book anywhere and get a new description of the size and performance of his penis.His younger brother, Nestor, is potentially more interesting. His life is tragically flawed, he spends all his time dreaming of a woman, Marie, he loved for a few months in Cuba."
3,Was able to put down.,"For my psych. self development course my teacher chose this book for us to read. I was very much into it at first, even with my busy schedule I was able to read much at a time leaving myself wanted to read more. Towards the end I no longer felt sorry for Ceasar, I was disguisted with him for some reason. I didn't want to read any more. I had mixed emotions. All in all I did finish reading it, I did enjoy it, but I would not recommend it, but to each's own."
3,Adult Entertainment,"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love is novel that is interesting for not only its great, (and unfortunate) story but also its reflection of an era of great music and an ethnic culture that heavily influenced NYC and eventually the country. The juxtaposition of the story with the Cuban revolution also presents a valuable insight to the era and U.S. immigration. While entertaining, the story often get losts in its sexual explicity, although the sexuality of the characters also develops their personal complexity (and possibly their dysfunction). Definitely worth a read."
2,Not my cup of rum,"Although I lived through the mambo/club era as a child and even watched the Lucy show for Lucy not Desi, I never identified with either the music or the people. I can't relate to the Latin lifestyle or the mindset of Latinos, the drinking, the macho thing, having never had any contact with the culture growing up in Germany and Chicago. The characters, and maybe even the author, seemed to be obsessed with sex, not something I care to read about on every page. I wonder they had time to play instruments and compose. Where's the plot, the story? I Read about 100 pages, skimmed the rest and don't think I missed anything. It's one of our book club selections so I was required to read it; I wouldn't have chosen it on my own. Also, although I ordered the paperback, I got a hardback book, a little cumbersome to take on trips."
1,Pulitzer Prize? Are you kidding me?,"I found this book pretty boring and too focused on the main character's sexual escapades. Very disappointing with very little depth to it. Perhaps had the book focused more on the other brother's woes, it would have had the potential to be a great read. I'm wondering if the book won so many awards because it is a Cuban story written in English for an English speaking audience."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"Don't get me wrong -- the designs are GREAT! I plan to incorporate several in my next quilt. But I am MOST disappointed that the CD doesn't include the patterns themselves so that they could be printed out from my own computer. My local quilt shops made such a big deal out of the fact that a CD was included in the high price, I (and they) thought that the CD would be patterns, not an instruction video. Now I find out that to get printable patterns, you have to buy an *additional* CD. Not a good way to do business, Ms. Doak -- it's called ""bait and switch""."
4,Love this book by Carol Doak. Very easy to use.,I am very happy with this book. It is easy to understand. Carol Doak definitely knows what she is doing.
5,50 Fabulous Paper-Pieced Stars,Love this book and having the CD is a real plus!!Change the sizes on the computer and your set to print.Make any star the way you want and its easy!
1,Not easy to use,The CD contains the authors tips...but that is not really that valuable if you are not a novice at paper piecing. The stars are all large and difficult to copy and multiple manipulations would be needed to reduce the size and make multiple copies. The difficulty in copying and changing the size of the blocks makes this book to difficult and not at all fun to use or own. I feel like I wasted $28 on the book. If the CD had the patterns so that you could easily print and vary the size it might have been a nice investment.
4,"great ideas, simple to create","Anyone who has the basic fundamentals of paper piecing can create any of these complex-looking, yet easy to make blocks. The patterns for each of the stars (named after the 50 states) are included."
5,Gorgeous stars,These paper pieced stars are beautiful. I have seen many quilts done using them and they are gorgeous. Can't wait to make one.
3,Good book,The book was received in good condition but the DVD in the back was broken in half so I couldn;t watch the instructions.
4,not perfect but ...,"Whatever about the review below..I bought this because OF the edit versions, which to a Mission fan like me are rare. Really wish the 7inch edit (or video version, only on 12inch) of Tower Of Strength was included. To my knowledge that 4 an half minute version has not made it to CD. Only version is the LP 8 min version on every comp I know of. Now that is a shame"
1,a terrible injustice has been done...,"Amongst other things, my main reason for buying this compilation was to have a copy of ""wasteland"" on CD. What the amazon listing fails to note is that this compilation is filled with 7"" edits of the original versions! So much Mission that hasn't been available on CD for so long, and they give us EDITS? What a shame. all of the following tracks are noted as the 7"" versions:crystal oceanstay with mewastelandseverinabeyond the paleinto the bluenever againlika child againplus, some of the included remixes are noted as edits:tower of strength (bombay mix edit)shades of green (utah saints 7"" mix)"
2,Deceptive,"I bought this purely based on the pretty woman on the cover and was very dissatisfied to find that instead of the slow burn torch songs I was expecting, I got some pop music by way of Led Zeppelin. They shouldn't tempt you with the attractive ladies, all flowing locks, only to let you down once you listen."
2,Disappointed,"Although I have seen ""Leningrad Cowboys Go America"" several times,this CD was a big disappointment.Out of the 11 songs,there are only 4 I would rate as listenable.The rest are just strange,bizarre or downright sonically painful!Sweet Home Alabama,Hometown,I'm not an a*****e,Katjusha Ula-Mix,Drink Beer Polka and Kasakka Remix are just awful.My tastes run from Bach to Buck Owens,to Elvis and to ZZ Top,so I think that my tastes are pretty broad.Would not have bought this album if I could have listened to some cuts.I think that this was more of an experiment on the part of the Leningrad Cowboys,considering the diverse songs that they try to musically interpret ,but never quite pull off.My .02."
4,Great Comforter..but hard to find 92 x 92 cover!,"This down comforter is awesome! Very cozy..not too hot. However, I should have checked for duvet covers to fit this before I purchased it. I am having a hard time locating a 92 x 92 cover that fits. Most queen duvet covers are 86 x 86 or 86 x 90. Has anyone found a cover that will fit? The one I have now is too small and the comforter bunches up inside of it. Another cover I have is too big. I may end up having one custom made. But, besides this...the quality and price are great!"
5,Awesome!,"My wife and I love this thing. We live in a cold mountain community, 10 to 20 below is not uncommon in the winter and I turn the thermostat way down at night. This comforter replaced three heavy blankets and sometimes it's to warm. Highly recommend if you like to sleep warm."
2,royle velvet comforter,The comforter is beautiful and quite large for a queen size bed. It looks very nice. It is very heavy and very hot. I can not use it on my bed. My bed was why it was purchase. I quess I will save it for comapany or give it to my children. I was disappointed in my choice.
4,Comforter,Comforter is like sleeping under a cloud. It is soft and silky but not aswarm as I hoped in winter.
4,"Not perfect, but good enough","I was pretty happy with this comforter when I just got it. It fluffed up well, and it's really soft and comfy. I didn't give it 5-star, because I found the feathers started flying out the comforter few weeks later, and the feathers didn't stay in their original ""baffled box"" as claimed, so the down is not evenly distributed now, some spots are almost empty. But I still think it worths the investment after I spent the cooler than normal Winter & Spring with it."
1,A fresh sound gets grating quickly,"At first Mama Cass' lyrics and songs are buoyant and uplifting. However, after a couple of tunes I was craving for more realistic somber fare."
5,THE BEST!,"This is my favorite movie, and the soundtrack is amazing. Mama Cass has several songs us homosexuals can ALL relate to. I love it so much. Too bad there couldn't be a track where Leah sang one of the songs she sings in the movie. She was so funny. Jamie and Ste... both hotties... specially Jamie."
5,Feel...so...dirty...,"Uptight straight guys like me will have to be careful under what circumstances they listen to this music, so as not to be found out, but this is really a great collection. Mama Cass has a beautiful singing voice, and although I can't pretend to know a lot about her, I'd be surprised to find that these weren't most of her best songs. It really gives you a sense of a bygone age; the sweetness and purity of the sentiment, and the guileless energy of the music. Some of the songs, also, are deceptively complex; take 'Go Where You Wanna Go,' which isn't as cheerful as it seems at first. The music may have a simple sound, but the lyrics can explore subjects with a depth that pop music almost never approaches today. The soundtrack as a whole, too, is a great purchase, being more cohesive than most soundtracks, and with a logical track order. The single instrumental track is also very good."
5,The Mastery of Mystery,"Reading Larrain's detective-cum-adventure novel Movies on the Sails, you will be catapulted willingly into a world populated by sharp-cracking beauties who use their wiles well and poetry-quoting detectives with a penchant for adventure and baseball. Picture noir detective Sam Spade played by a poetry-speaking Robert Redford from ""The Natural,"" set in the midst of the sexual revolution and you might just get an idea of the world inside Michael Larrain's brain--where, mystery, philosophy and poetry vie as top muses.Larrain does a twist on mystery though, by writing with the heart and the finesse of a poet. His writing probes the deeper mysteries and offer a glimpse of understanding denied to us in our real lives. Movies on the Sails does not disappoint because it flies above all possible expectations, surprising and exhilarating the reader."
4,"Mystery, sports story, poetry, or what?","If you like a good mystery, baseball or are captivated by ""wordsmithery,"" there'll be something for you in ""Movies on the Sails."" The author has a wonderful way with words, and the double entrendres come fast and furious as our hero and his Way Up Firm and High Tail It Bright Out of Town Detective Agency friends deal equally deftly with fastballs, highballs and close calls."
4,Poetic Fiction,"Michael Larrain's writing style is sensual, lush and lilting. His prose is poetic in nature and verges on hypnotic. Once started, the book is hard to put down and may result in an overwhelming urge to visit Hawaii."
5,Awesome CD's for Francophones and Non-Francophones,"Anyone who is a fan of Jane Birkin will love these 2 CDs.Arabesque has taken the work of Serge Gainsbourg and reorchestrated them with an Arabic/North African influence. Birkin has transformed these classic Gainsbourg works into something new and exotic. I find it very relaxing and will listen to it to wind down before bed.Rendez-vous is a whole CD devoted to duets with some of the biggest names in French Music and also International Artists. The music is quite varied with influences from France, Brazil, Italy, Japan and also the US.If you love Alain Souchon, Alain Chamfort, Francoise Hardy, Brian Ferry, Etienne Daho, etc. you will love the duets with Jane!!!"
1,Haven't recieved it yet....,Well I ordered it over a month ago and still haven't got it. The song is great but i don't know about the cd. So much for 2-3 days...
4,A fun-filled adventurous romance,"I really enjoyed this book. This story was more light-hearted than other Jude Deveraux books, but that's how some of her stories are. Some are more emotional than others. I actually laughed out loud several times while reading this book.I really like Tynan, being the ""tortured hero"" that he is. He was really focused on changing his life, and not falling back into the bad habits and wild lifestyle he'd once led. How could he do that if he defied Christiana's father? This just proved to be an obstacle that made the story what it is. What's a good romance read without obstacles?Christiana was an admirable heroine, she had a lot of spirit, and she was able to overstep the boundaries of what was deemed as socially acceptable for women of her time.Some say this story was not believable. To me, most historical romances are not believable and are totally out of the ordinary. That's why I enjoy historical romances better than contemporaries."
3,"Not like her others, but still a good read","I have to say that when I first began to read this book, I almost immediately took a dislike to it. I am so used to the usual way that Jude writes and this was not it. Tynan and Chris have this amazing heat when he abducts her. She almost seems to enjoy his touching and caressing... That just doesn't seem realistic to me. During an abduction fear or terror would be more seemly. The characters sometimes didn't seem real and there was really not too much romance in the book. I never sensed true sexual tension between them or much love either. It had a good story plot though where action is concerned. It was a quick and easy read and I did like the ending. I'm a huge fan of Jude Deveraux's and I have never rated her below a 4... but this book really is more of a 3 to me. For classic Jude, check out her other books first such as The Princess, The Conquest, Knight in Shining Armor, etc. This one might discourage you from reading more of her."
2,disappointing :(,"this was my first jude devereux book. I was looking for her books everywhere when I bought it cause I was recommended to read her. It was really disappointing. The characters are shallow. I can't understand any of Chris's actions nor how suddenly in two pages the whole pieces of the story fit together. IF you're a Jude Devereux fan, plz recommend me another book of hers that would make me forget this one.My email address is m_abd_el_wahab@hotmail.com. thanks"
2,The Temptress,"Tynan is THE man? I found the two people competing for Christiana's interest rather unconvincing and inconsistent,e.g. I find it hard to believe that Tynan (given the way he was characterized) would stay away from Christiana just because he's afraid of her father. It's not very believable. I happen to like of Deveraux's books, but I wouldn't recommend this one because of the sappy characters."
1,Please skip this one,"I never reviewed one of Jude Deveraux's books before, because usually they are so good! I loved The Heiress, The Summerhouse, Legend and the must read Remembrance. But this book was absolutely horrible an I had to warn the deveraux fans to stay away from it. It was totally unbelievable that Tynan and Chris would fall in love with each other, there was no sexual tension, believable plot or anything likable about Tynan or Chris. She falls in love with a man for no reason at all than attraction and the fact 'he is so queit'. He only wants her for sex the entire time but at the end he miraculoussly sees the ligt and still wants to marry her and even that is questionable because he can't even look at her when he says 'i do'. Again stay away from this if you love romance..."
2,disappointing,"I found the story somewhat boring. Having two men in practically every scene, I found distracting. It seemed forced. Not nearly as enjoyable as some of her other books.This is one to skip."
1,Big Disappointment,"Not at all up to par of Jude Devereaux's other books. I had wished she would write more books with a Montgomery woman as the protagonist, but this is definitely not it. Just plain bad, with shallow characters, and none of the humor that I love in her other books"
1,Jude Deveraux must have had a bad day when she wrote this ...,"This book was plain weird. I've read all but five or six of Jude Deveraux' books, some of them are quite cheesy, some a bit over the top, but most of them are romantic page turners and all made me stay with the characters until their last embrace *sigh*THIS book, though, ""The Temptress"", is the first one I quit reading after 45 pages. I was trying to forgive the really unbelievable beginning (he jumps out of the wardrobe, grabs her naked body and she, instead of being scared or feeling threatened, ENJOYS the touch of this stranger - com'on, get a little bit real), and fighting through the next pages - one stupid, unbelievable happening after the other, as if the protagonists were insane - it just didn't get better but worse and worse. This story started weird (actually, I thought I missed some pages at first) and went downhill from there. Skip this, enjoy the other Jude Deveraux books - there are enough! :)"
3,A western that would make a great movie.,"It was hard to get a picture of the character's in your mind. Although I liked the story, I really enjoy reading Deveraux historical novels instead. It has a very grabbing beginning and it has a very weak ending. I liked Tynan but I found it hard to love him, like I do with the rest of Deveraux's Men."
5,great.....,"This is very fun to color. If you love to color horses you would love this book. All of the My little pony books are fun to color, but this one is the best! You should get this book.5 stars, WoW! My favorite pony is Wysteria, her pages are the fun to color! This book is for ages 2-10! It comes with fun and colorful tattoos too!!"
2,Crap,Crap...why can't they issue what people want. Collections with all the good songs in complete form as on original album & throw in some great live tracks. Come Back version here is missing almost 2 minutes and Give It To Me close to 3 minutes shorter. Should include Musta Got Lost album version as one of their best. Should have just made it 2 discs & be done with it. They have plenty of great stuff for 2 complete discs.
2,very average,"if you are buying a J Geils CD, there has to be a better one. I am a non sophisticated buyer (don't remember names of songs, etc.), but enjoy many of J Geils songs, this CD lacks substance."
4,My Kids Like This CD (I do too!),"If you are over 35 years old you will remember about 75% of the songs on this compilation. I purchased this CD because my two boys have heard ""Centerfold"" on the radio and love to sing along. They don't understand the lyrics (not yet anyway,..too early for that conversation) but you have to admit the refrain is infectious. This is a must have CD for ""road trips"" and/ or decade theme parties (70's and 80's). Not a 5 star from me due to sound quality of live selections."
4,"A ""Best of"" done right","Many times these types of post career compilations are simply attempts to milk a little more cash after numerous ""best ofs"" and ""greatest hits"". However, in the case of J. Geils this is the one true essential disc. It has the big hits, but it also has the classic live tracks that have become rock radio staples. The only thing keeping this from five stars is the lumbering ""Teresa"" and the needless ""Piss on the Wall"". Substitute a cut from ""Monkey Island"" like ""Surrender"" or ""Somebody"" and this would be the perfect career summary."
5,Excellent look at the state of the language,"I was pleased to see that there is finally a dictionary that reflected the contemporary state of the language, instead of the fossilized form most dictionaries present. One of my favorite aspects of this dictionary are the Word Key boxes, which give interesting asides on the etymology and cultural contexts of certain words and phrases. Don't be put off by Microsoft's role in the dictionary's creation. A dictionary stands or fall s on the skill and art of the lexicographers who create it. Encarta got some of the best in the business and this dictionary easily stands comparisons with, say, the American Heritage Dictionary."
4,Innovative approach to the evolving common tongue...,"...Still far from perfect, though. Could well set a new benchmark standard that will keep the traditional ""rules are rules"" crowd spinning in their wooden chairs.A great dictionary for College and High School kids. Lively, hip...and relevant.The language fogies (such as this writer) will just have to get used to it. I'm coming around already."
5,My ENCARTA Dictionaries,"I purchased a copy of this dictionary about 5 months ago. My passion is studying the roots of words as well as the multi meanings of the words (semantics). I love writing, do not want to be garrulous. I have one copy at my office, one copy in my room and one copy for my fiance who lives with me and I just bought one for my nephew. I actually have asked my local bookstore manager to locate a couple of more for me to give to my brothers as gift. I find this dictionary the best I have ever had. Of course English being my second language, in past twenty five years, I have had more than a dozen of dictionaries. The pictorial, the examples, and history of the words in this dictionary have just been very helpful and insightful. Sam Ghezavat"
2,Not worth the purchase price,"This dictionary was given to me recently by a well-meaning relative; it seems that it has already been sent to the deep discount bin of her local mega bookstore. She knows that I love dictionaries and purchased it for me, thinking that she had found a bargain.Beware -- this dictionary is woefully poor in execution. Definitions often resort to using the root word within the definition, the alphabetical order it employs is not the same way to alphabetize that I learned in elementary school, lots of small print, etc.For a dictionary which is supposed to be a ""world"" English dictionary, it seems to lack many world variations on definitions and leaves out ""world English"" vocabulary, too. This dictionary is clearly aimed at an United States audience.Your money is better spent on a Merriam-Webster or American Heritage product."
1,Let the mayhem begin.,"This dictionary scares me. Seriously. I am no opponent of neology, but it seems that Microsoft's latest foray into world domination has no other purpose but to obfuscate the English language with horrendously irrelevant colloquialisms such as ""jeepnay"" that belong in a slang dictionary, not in a dictionary supposed to be the benchmark of a new standard in lexicography. Why, by cluttering the language and thus the minds of English speakers worldwide, this Microsoft Encarta Newspeak 1.0 dictionary certainly *will* take language in a new direction -- the One Microsoft Way."
1,Horrible distortion of lexicography.,"Microsoft has proved once again how admirably it makes inferior products. This ""dictionary"" pales in comparison to the Oxford or the American Heritage, and rather than being a record of the English language, reads more like a tome of propaganidistic Newspeak with unnecessary words and altered, twisted definitions."
5,The Best Music For Your Memories On Summer 1999,On this CD's you will definetly find all the best music from summer 1999. From Spanish songs to dance music.
4,ibiza mix,"If you went to Spain last summer well you would love to have all the songs from the clubs in one mix, this set has 4 cd's and is well worth it, with songs by 2 eivissa and enrique iglesias well this cd has everything and a good mix."
2,moldy crickets,I gave this item a 2 star because after i received the crickets i put them in fridge like it says to do so and ended up throwing half of them away because mold started growing on them and i didn't think they would be safe to feed my turtles. my advice is to get smaller amount unless you are going to use them right away.
1,Decal poorly placed with wrinkles,"i would not advise ordering this dapple dachshund water bottle through Amazon from 3dRose.com - - - not only is the water bottle itty bitty, but the decal of the dachshund that was obviously quickly placed on the water bottle had at least 3 wrinkles in it - all the way along the decal from top to bottom.... it was obviously placed during a power outage for there must have been no light to show the OBVIOUS wrinkles all through the decal. i'm sure there is elsewhere one can go to get a quality item whom one actually takes time to prepare. There is a nice order invoice placed within the packaging... just look past the typos / or printer margin errors"
5,Classic NY Hardhouse,"Its out of print, and you really should own it...You could still mix most of these songs into a dj set."
4,Great Stuff,"this is a must have for all deacon fans. i keep mine in the car. great versions of the fight song and deacon joy. excerpts from Doc Murphy, one of the most rabid Deacon fans of all time. he knows how to tell a story. very funny tales concerning wake people and players. great for older fans to reminisce. great for younger fans to get a sense of history. also some really good music cuts that you hear at fball and bball games from time to time. if you like the Deacs, or know someone that does, i highly recommend this CD."
1,oh man..,I remember I bought this thing a while back and the stupid pin slipped out and got stuck inside my tv......hahaha I think it's still inside our guest room tv......
5,Love this book,"I purchased this book years ago as something to read on a flight and didn't know what to expect. This book is now considered the Lesbian Bible amongst my friends. It is full of things that may seem very obvious, but it states things in a way you may have never considered. This book is like talking to a good friend.. sometimes you know the answers and just need to ""hear"" someone else say it."
4,nice book,"If you are looking for a general relationship book, this is the way to go. It has sound communication advice and also brings to light how difficult a lesbian relationship can be. For me, it helped me remember that all relationships either gay or straight have difficulties. I would totally recommend this book, especially fpr those women who have found themselves in a lesbian relationship for the first time."
4,Black & Decker Iron,"We are very happy with this iron. It's a good weight and puts out a lot of steam. This helps reduce our ironing time. It's easy to refill the water resevoir. The sprayer works well.Unfortunately, because of the larger retractable cord reel base, it no longer fits in the space provided by our NuTone ironing center."
1,Bad idea,"I bought this iron last August. It stopped working, for no reason, by December. The previous iron I purchased, also by the same brand, only lasted one year. This is very disapointing because the previous iron I had to that one was also a B&D and it lasted almost exactly 15 years. But it looks like B&D must really be going down hill."
4,Clear Water,"This helps keep my pond water clear, even in the Florida heat and sun. Also, it's safe for fish and pets."
2,Disappointing,"I am extremely disappointed by a book which is disorganized, has uncreative examples and very little added value and does not use typography and layout to it's best advantages.While introducing a subject, the book is full of ""we'll see this later"" and ""as i mentioned earlier"", the flow of information is unstructured and unsatisfying.Each example in a book should illustrate a point and help people understand. Here absolutely no effort is done to look for real-life example or to make them interesting. The most interesting ones are copies from sqlbol. Many do not illustrate anything at all as do the author recognize in the text (""Of course in practice you don't need dynamic sql at all in such a situation...""). What a change from Joe Celko.The few pieces of information that are original and interesting are generally completely hidden in the text/layout, which will make it very hard to find it again some time later. Why not use more bold, italics and so forth?"
4,woho....they rock,"i saw revolverheld as the supporting act of silbermond on a concert in germany...i have to say, they really rock...i totally love ""freunde bleiben"", but the other tracks are good, too, even if the lyrics are kinda simple sometimes.....that may not be important if you don't understand german anyway, but since i'm german, i do....whatsoever, this is a fun-rocky-loud album and i totally love the voice of the leadsinger....must have, if you're into german rock"
4,Knockout,"It`s a funny record that mixing balalakas and a big choir. It`s a great record with ""sweet home Alabama"" and ""gimme all your lovin`"" as the best song on the record.Other songs that are special is ""yellow submarine"" ,""California girls"" , ""let`s work together"" and ""knocking on heaven`s door"". And it`s a great rock`n`roll album. Go out and buy it.."
5,warsaw pac rock and roll,"We received this CD as a gift a few years backand have completely enjoyed it. The musicis a combination of American Rock and Roll donewith the Soviet Red Army Ensemble. The combinationof the formally trained classical voices withstrong Russian accents puts a whole new twiston the classic rock and roll hits. I had never consideredhow strange ""Yellow Submarine"" and ""CaliforniaGirls"" could be when sung by Red Army. It isreally strange, and just a blast to listen to.The actual performances are great, but the clashof Warsaw Pac meets Rock and Roll is priceless."
4,classic,i used to have this tune but i was a bit dissapointed of the signum mixes not there best stuff but the original is a blinder of a track great stuff
5,Where did this Great Gum Go?,"My favorite gum, great flavor and lasts forever. But what happened? Suddenly nobody sells it anymore. I hope they don't stop making it. Mint and Spearmint just don't cut it for me, and Big Red has sugar and the flavor is gone after a couple chews.I hope Amazon can keep it going."
4,A good introduction to Buddhism,"Before reading this book, I didn't know much about Buddhism, and reading it made me realize just how little I really knew. It gave me a good perspective on Buddhist practice and especially the difference between Zen Buddhism (what I knew a little about) and the rest of the Buddhist world."
4,Exxcellent but for advanced,"Marvellous book, however, the two parts are more for people that already know about Buddhism from practice, those who have their Kleisha yet cannot understand about void or Tantra, aspects that cannot be understood without the deep moral basis attained by following the Four Noble Truths. Thus the First part of the book is for everybody who wants to learn in general about Buddhism, but then the book starts to be very complicated, what a pitty for neophytes.One is not that surprised the write has gained so many doctorates, his intelligence is sparkling from the text, but this would be for a different review..."
1,not what I thought,"sorry, all on me- not what I thought it would be- my fault entirely- it was my mistake to order"
4,This product is awesome,For those that smoke in the house you should definitely get the lamp and the oil. It removes the smell of the smoke while you are having a cigarette or cigar even hours after you turn off the burning oil lamp. It's a must have for those who smoke in the house but do not want the lingering smell of cigarettes or cigars. There's no flame like when candles are used to cover the smoke smell.
4,If you don't like country,"This album was probably the first country flavored album I ever bought. Every song on this album is great and it brings back old momories. If you don't own any Jerry Jeff,this is probably the best one to start with."
3,Short life,"Seller was good - Product was working and was exactly as described and pictured. However, batteries did not hold charge for more than a few months. I think the batteries were NOS (new old stock)."
3,Got here fast but with cracks,"It got here extremely fast, however, There is about half an inch crack in the front of the case and 2 cracks on the back."
3,Too simple for a 1st grader,"This was given to me by a friend and I am glad I didn't actually purchase it. The worksheets cover the skills my soon to be first grader covered at the beginning of Kindergarten. He zips through the pages like they are nothing at all. We are trying to keep sharp over the summer and we use this as well as the Mead Problem Solving workbook. Mead's is a MUCH better, challenging, workbook than this one.My almost 1st grader is my youngest, so we have tried a few different workbooks with the other 3 children, and I have to say that Mead and Spectrum make better workbooks than this one."
5,Stirring Idealism,"A story of youthful ideals, where anything is possible in the world. I've watched this film many times and it makes me think even in middle age, that it is still possible to make the world a better place."
1,a let down,"sorry to say that this dvd was a massive let down. i eagerly awated the arrival of this dvd as i have always been a huge fan of the group , but this concert does not do martha any favours . her vocals are almost vibrato in their delivery and starts to aggrivate after listening to 3 or more songs . gone is the fantastic power and excitement that the band used to generate. a really flat performance"
5,Martha as you've never seen her before,This DVD is pure pleasure. It makes you wonder how such a talented artist could not maintain her huge popularity through the years. Her voice is in pristine shape and the notes she hits are mind-blowing. The piece is made even more wonderful by the addition of the dancers who are trying to recreate the dances and the era in which Martha made all those songs megasmashes. One downside is that I was led to believe that Martha duets with Sam Cooke on some of his smashes since this is her DVD and her moment to shine. What better way than to have her due with Sam on some of his classics?
3,LOS AÑOS PASAN......,"DVD CASI BIEN LOGRADO, SOLO LE FALTO A MARTHA REEVES PONERLE UN POCO MAS DE GANAS AL CANTAR, LA VOZ POCO TRABAJADA DESDE HACE VARIOS AÑOS SE NOTA EN ESTE DVD, PODRIA HABER SIDO MUCHO MEJOR."
4,A look at 1970's television,"Television stars of 1973. Short bios on TV stars like Michael Douglas, Sandy Duncan, Dick Van Dyke and Susan Dey, with many black and white photos."
4,The Big Picture,"This book is written in textbook-style (because it is a textbook) and gives the reader a perspective of the 'big picture' of the time-period covered. It does this well. My only criticism is the bookcover, which though aesthetically appealing, is flimsy."
2,Didn't Last,"I purchased this coffee maker less than a year and a half ago. It is receiving low marks for its short service life. Apart from its principle function, this maker was chosen because it had a programmable brew timer and the color complements our kitchen decor. It has a number of other features which are handy and worked well enough before the thing gave up the ghost. As for coffee; I'm no connoisseur and I just want some joe in the morning which it had thus far prepared adequately and reliably. And it should as these things are simple devices and have been around for decades. Our example, however, quit working this morning. All of the electronics fired up on schedule but the heating elements in both the percolator and the warming plate failed rendering the unit useless. It had a one year warranty which has expired. Our previous maker lasted for over ten years and we replaced it as we could not find a replacement for a broken carafe. Any coffee maker should last longer than this one."
5,Great coffee maker for a great price,Best coffe maker ever. The filter makes a HUGE difference in coffee quality. Being able to turn down the burner keeps it tasting great. The timer maker it a slam dunk. Looks good too.
2,It starts off good then....,"I received this coffee maker a year and half ago. It was the best one I'd ever owned. The filter is great, especially since I have a lot of chlorine in my water. The coffee was hot, tasted great, and I never had a problem until about a month ago. Slowly it started making less and less coffee, even though I used the same amount of water. Steam was leaking into the clock face, which is still full of water even though it's been unplugged for weeks now. It wouldn't turn off after pressing the button. All in all, it just went down hill fast. But, until a month ago I would've said don't buy any other maker...now I just don't know. After having read the reviews it seems mine lasted forever! Most were just a few months, and I got a year and half out of mine."
1,0 STARS IF I COULD. TERRIBLE COFFEE MAKER.,"I wish I could leave this coffee maker 0 stars... The look of it is great but I was having problems with it within 2 months. The hot plate started going out so my coffee, when poured, wasn't hot. Then the water wouldn't seep in to the pot properly when making it so coffee started tasting horrible. I tried cleaning it numerous times to no avail.It has a lot of great features but whats the point to that unless it works.Steam from making coffee would also leak in to the clock of the coffee maker. I'm an avid coffee drinker and this is the worst one I have ever bought. I don't usually give bad reviews on Amazon, and I buy a lot of stuff here, but thought I had to make people aware of what they will be getting in to if ordering this particular Model. Their is plenty of other Black and Red nice looking coffee makers here on Amazon, or through Google, my advise is to buy one of them."
4,Pioneer Spirit,"If you liked the pioneer spirit of Laura Ingalls Wilder in the series of Little House on the Prairie books, you will love Grace Snyder in this book as an adult. Grace tells her story from an adult perspective about her entire life from 1882-1982, mostly in Nebraska. She was a remarkable woman who lived through many trials and triumphs throughout her lifetime. Although the story does not entirely focus on her quilt making, if you have an appreciation for quilts, it makes the book even more endearing."
4,"Very slept on , time to wake up.","I would have given this cd 5 stars if not for all the guest appereances, that is about the only flaw I find in this cd. Gangsta dre comes with his very tight flow, and creative lyrics again, on the best beats I have heard on a gangsta dre cd. I am suprised that more people do not know about this album. It is very tight, tight lyrics , tight beats , sadly it is out of print, but is still around every now and again. Cd features hollow tip, lemay , lunicoleone, greedy , and more."
3,"Enjoyable, But Flawed","""Captain Sam Grant"" must rank with William McFeely's ""Grant"" and Brooks Simpson's ""Triumph Over Adversity"" as the most overrated USG biographies ever written. This look at Grant's pre-Civil War years simply is not as accurate and reliable as some previous reviewers would have us believe. Lewis frequently makes assertions without providing adequate evidence for these statements, and he occasionally cites dubious or discredited sources. The book, in many places, reads more like an speculative historical novel than a serious academic study. Also, in my opinion, Lewis spends way too much time on the Mexican war.That said, it is not without virtues. It is engaging and, in its folksy way, well written. Lewis' portrait of Grant's quietly complicated character generally rings true. The book is an enjoyable read, as long as the reader does not expect too much."
1,The song itself...,"This song is really awesome! Although I still don't own the cd or 12"" I love when the dj cranks it up at the club, I'm not yet quite sure who remixed it. However, I do think they should have at least displayed the track listing of this import, otherwise, how will customers sample the song? The song itself is really cool, it will make you shake it on the dance floor..."
1,not a remix,"This is not the remixed version of ""i believe in love"" that you hear in the nightclubs. it's got the plain old version that you can buy from the U.S. release for 2.99."
4,if you're fan.....get it,"if you are a paula cole fan this is definitely a cd for you. the music is great. i really like ""i believe in love"" myself, but...it is definitely a good single!"
3,Good for beginners.............,"I gave this book 3 stars because it was OK, but it could have been alot better....(1) Too expensive-even for 10 dollars! The size of it is the size of a manga book, which is pretty small.(2) Only HALF of the kana characters in both Hirigana and Katakana were featured......(3) If you really want to learn about Japan's CULTURE, not about the language itself, read this book.(4) This is one of the positive things about this book-at least they got the stroke order correct! (I'm Chinese, and I have memorized by HEART the frickin stroke orders...............)Buy this for children who have just entered the ""OMG, I MUST LEARN JAPANESE BECAUSE IT IS SO COOL AND THEY SPEAK IT IN THE ANIME SHOWS I WATCH EVERY MORNING...blah blah etc"" stage...."
4,Convenient and easy to learn,"Each page has a Hiragana/Katakana character with brief explanation, and illustration to show how it's used. The book is about the size of averge paperback novels. Price is a bit too high for the amount of info included, but it does get the job done: makes sure you can read Hiragana and Katakana."
5,"great tool, learned all the basic Hiragana and Katakana very quickly...","I was looking around for a book that would teach me to read and write Katakana and Hiragana, and I stumpled across this book. Kana de manga really isn't lying when they say the little pictures in the book help you to learn. The overall layout of the book was great, and the practice section was really well done. If you need to learn katakana and hiragana, then this is the book for you."
4,Serves it's purpose,I purchased this along with a beverage decanter and the two of them work well and look great together. Highly recommend.
4,"Excellent optics, a few issues","The first thing that I noticed is that, while 500 feet field of view at 1000 yards is claimed for these binoculars in their description on Amazon, on the binocular itself is printed 420 ft at 1000 yards, still very good, but maximum field of view was one of the reasons I bought these. Others reviewing the more popular and more reviewed 8x40 wide angle version have written good detail on the optical performance. It is surprisingly good for a binocular of this price. Having spotted birds, for example, with the naked eye, it's easier to find them in a wooded environment with this binocular than with most that I have owned.In sub-zero weather, an issue or two became evident. Most annoying was the great increase in force necessary to change the focus. I had to remove gloves and use both hands, not very comfortable at minus five degrees. But the optical performance was there, and that makes these well worth the price."
4,Excellent And Comprehensive,"....just what you want in a career-retrospective set like this one. Though the Gang were never my (or anybody else's) favorite, they had enough good moments to warrant this 2CD anthology, and all of them are here. Don't worry, Tommy Bolin fans aren't cheated as there's plenty of his material on hand (in my view, the Gang's single best album is BANG!). The chance to hear all the various lineups makes this a pretty cool historical document you can play air guitar to."
3,WHAT'S A FAN SUPPOSED TO DO?,"The James Gang were big around these parts (Eastern Ohio/Western PA) back when Joe Walsh was the guitar man. They played several times at the small college I went to. Great live band.So now I'd like to buy the Joe Walsh era for my collection. According tosome reviewers, the MCA reissues of the first three studio albums are murky sounding. The Repetoire two disc best of is supposed to be sonically excellent, but there's only 14 cuts with Joe Walsh on guitar.That's a shame. Because even though the band forged on after Joe left,it was never the same.Why Repetoire devoted 1-1/2 discs to the lineups post Walsh I can't understand. The choice is hard - murky sounding but complete 1st three discs, or insufficient but great sounding best of. Hmmmmm...I cannot decide."
3,WHAT?????!!!!!!!,I can't believe anyone would EVER consider post Walsh in a James Gang compilation set. The 3 stars is only for HIS involvement!! There really was no Gang after Joe.SORRY! But Joe's da Man!!!!
3,"Decent documentry, but with omissions","This documentary was well put together and accurate, but it fails to mention the the Armada of 1588 was but one battle in the Anglo-Spanish war that lasted from 1585 to 1604. This documentary fails to state the facts of that war such as the disaster the English suffered in 1589 when Drake and Norris suffered a defeat of equal proportion in their fruitless attempt to destroythe rest of the Spanish Navy in Northern Spain. This documentary also fails to mention that the Spanish Navy continued to dominate the seas after 1589 wining most of the naval clashes and eventually forcing King James I, Elizabeth's successor, to make peace with terms mostly favorable to Spain in 1604."
1,Not the soundtrack.,"I watched the movie for the first time last month, July 09, and loved it. Especially the music. However, when I listened to the CD I had to go to Hulu and watch the movie again to see if I watched the wrong movie. None of the songs were in the movie or sung by someone else because nothing sounds the same."
3,Good music but from other age,"Songs are good indeed (""My secret love"" is masterpiece) but arrangements are COMPLETELY out of time frame. Sound is from 70th at best, probably from 80th."
4,One of my all time favorites!,"I love this soundtrack and play it often even after all these years. The songs are kind of hokey, but then, so were a lot of songs from that era. I also own the movie. I rarely watch a movie more than once, but I had to have this one. I would recommend this to anyone who grew up in the '60s."
2,I FOUND THE MOVIE VERSION OF GOD GIVE ME STRENGTH,"Those of you lamenting the shameful omission of the movie's version of ""God Give Me Grace"" from this soundtrack can now rejoice. The album ""Heart Beats: Love Scene - Romantic Movie Music"" not only includes ""Denise's"" version of this amazing and heartbreaking ballad, but it also has a few gems from other soundtracks, including a couple of one-hit wonders from the 90's that are harder to find. Hope this helps everyone who loves this soundtrack but miss the movie's centerpiece song. Personally, without the signature song, I wondered why a soundtrack was necessary at all."
3,Mystery resolved for Joni Mitchell Fans,"There were two releases of this CD--this first time around (MCAD-11510), MCA accidentally released it with Joni Mitchell singing Track #7 ""Man From Mars"" (possibly a demo recording) instead of Kristen Vigard who is listed as the singer on the jacket. The CD was subsequently re-released with Kristen Vigard singing ""Man From Mars"" (MCAD-11554). I am not a fan of this CD (not thrilled with most of the material), but it is an interesting find for those who want an unbilled Joni Mitchell performance of her own song--if you are looking for that, you want MCAD-11510 (read the small print on the jacket to make sure)."
2,God give me strength to deal with the disappointment,"Saw the movie. Got hooked on one song. I recognized the Burt Bacharach flavor. Illeana belts out ""God give me strength"".. this anthem of pain with pure angst and power. Unfortunately in the soundtrack version Illeana isn't performing! Elvis Costello takes the song on and falls short. He slips in & out of femine and masculine pronouns. The most powerful song has set sail on a paper ship..The rest of the CD's melodies take you down memory lane with a innocent look at love.You sing along with ""I do""..but the rest of the CD...you won't."
2,If only the female version of God give me strength,"The powerful lyrics and wistful delivery were my main desire, I'm going to look for the ""Love Scenes"" disc instead."
3,Disappointment yet pleasently suprized,"I've searched for the Illeana Douglas version of ""God give me strength"" far and wide, has anyone found it? Aside from that slight disappointment the soundtrack as a whole was very good, I actually re-watched the movie to catch the background songs I'd missed....Dawna"
4,"Are you sure that isn't you, Joni?","Actually, I'm cheating, and I don't know if I'll be able to get away with it. I agree with everyone else that this is an unusual and fun collection to listen to-- just as the movie was a treat of a sleeper. I wouldn't have expected going retro and recreating the sound of a bygone era to be so successful, but itworks for me. But here's the cheating-- basically I have a question. Is that really someone other than Joni singing the Joni Mitchell cut(?)because I have never heard anyone but Joni sound that much like her. And it doesn't sound much like the other Kristen Vigard cuts on the CD or in the movie. Either way, thank you, because I really enjoy the CD."
2,"Hey There, God Give Me Strength there are two songs missing","Bummer! The two songs I wanted the most were not on this CD! (Hey There and the girl version of God Give Me Strength.) Note to the other reviewers...It's not Illeana Douglas singing, it's a lesser known actress/singer by the name of Kristen Vigard. What were they thinking when they opted not to include these tunes?"
5,Grace For My Ears,"I absolutely loved this CD! The 60's girl group flavor of For Real, and the Temptation-esque qualities of Portrait, topped with the hit Bacharach/Costello-penned God Give Me Strength make for a fabulous romp into the past. The only downfall is the omission of Kristen Vigard's (Illeana Douglas's singing voice) version of God Give Me Strength. Otherwise, this is a highly recommended compilation, one of the best I've seen in years."
4,Kristen Vigard's version of God Give Me Strength,"Kristen Vigard did Illeana Douglas' (Denise's) singing in ""Grace of My Heart.""Her versions of ""Man From Mars"" and ""Boat On the Sea"" are on the soundtrack.Like a lot of reviewers here, I was disappointed that Vigard's version of ""God Give Me Strength"" was omitted in favor of Elvis Costello's.Kristen Vigard's version (albeit with a more spare arrangement) is on her own album, ""God, Loves and Angels."" It can be found on I-Tunes and on her own website."
2,Man on the Moon,Did not read this book. Gave it to a friend who had young child. Should have checked that it was for younger readers.
1,too mini for me,"Great idea but the capacity was only 1 tablespoon, which doesn't warrant use unless you really are a low fat diet person. Item was boxed carefully and shipped promptly."
2,Too Small,"These are just too small for my usage. They may be good if you are entertaining and want everyone to have a single server butter, but it is just too much effort for daily use."
3,Small and adoreable,"I was surprised to find how small these butter holders were...they looked larger in the picture. They hold about 1 1/2 Tablespoons of butter. However, that being said they are adorable and are well made."
1,Mini 4-Piece Butter Keeper Set,These are very small - just about large enough for one pat of butter. Not very practical in my opinion.
5,butter crocks,Nice for individual use. if you have a small f ridge need to protect them from spilling over
3,TINY,These are extremely small. I measured the butter this size holds and it is truly only one tablespoonful (one pat of butter). If that's what you are looking for then they are in all other ways the same as regular size crocks...but very very small.
4,The positive ratings are true!,good quality and easy to use. Great balance of features and price. Would definitely buy this again. This is just what my wife wanted.
1,Yeast dispenser problem,"Yeasts are not dispersed as they supposed to. Bread is not rising. Very bad breadmaker, poorly designed. I return it and got cheaper model which proved to be much more efficient."
3,"Great dough making machine, average baking","I've played a lot with recipes and functions but you really get a much better result when you only use the dough mode and bake your bread in the oven or dutch oven (both work well for me). You need to press the air out after the dough is done, fold it and let it rise for the second time. You simply get the best result this way. It's a missed opportunity that the machine doesn't have a delayed start or timer for the dough mode."
5,high-quality high-style shorts,"I picked up two pairs of these shorts in different colors to wear on vacation at a premium resort. I was looking for high-quality high-style shorts that I could wear in the ocean or a pool but that also would look good under a short-sleeved button-down at a pool or oceanside bar.These shorts are expensive, but they totally meet my needs. The fabric actually has the feel and thickness of chamois -- silky soft and durable. If you're looking for style and quality in a swim short, snap up a pair of these."
5,last 4x longer than alkaline batteries,"my digital camera ate up batteries like mad. alkaline batteries only lasted 45mins, with lcd off. tried out these batteries. on the first charge the camera lasted 2hrs, with lcd screen on, red eye reduction flash on, at highest resolution. after a few charges they last about 2hrs and 30mins. I have had them for about a month and already saved money on battries. plus with the mach 1 speed charger, only takes 1hr and 20mins to recharge them."
5,A Great Recording Remastered!,"This CD was released approximately the same time as the four disc box set, but only in Europe. It covers the years of 1967 to 1979 with only the major hits. It's a nice greatest hits CD if you don't want to be bothered with the extraneous minor hits and album cuts of the Box Set. It was already well mixed at the first printing - but this remastered version is amazing!"
4,FROM THE CHRONICLES OF THE CLOTHESPIN,"IN A PHRASE OR TWO, ....WE CAN TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE NEW YORK TIMES EFFECT ON MAN....WHETHER YOUR A BROTHER OR WHETHER YOUR A MOTHER YOUR STAYIN' ALIVE STAYIN' ALIVE...FEEL THE CITY BREAKIN' AND EV'RYBODY SHAKIN' AND WERE STAYIN' ALIVE......................EXCELLENT THE BEEGEES HAVE BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE CROSSOVER BAND OF THE 70'S AND 80'S THIS SELECTION HERE HAS ALL OF THEIR GREATEST HITS FEATURING ANDY GIBB AND I MUST ADMIT SOME OF THE FINEST PIECES OF WORK HERE DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT BUY IT AND YOU WILL SEE JUST WHAT THE RAVE IS ALL ABOUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111"
3,"Great cover, bad price","This collection is the third of the Very Best of the Bee Gees, and the songs started from the 1969s till 1989s. All songs are greatest hits, and beloved by millions of people. If you are a collector, this is a buy right now CD, and not recommended for normal listeners. Reason1 - Too expensive Reason2 - Not extensiveRecommendation to this collection is Tales From the Brother Gibbs."
4,Nice Wedding Ring Set,"I thought it was a little too gawdy. The center stone was too big. Will wear it every now and then for a nice occasion, but not for everyday use. Got it really quick too."
4,Just Right,"This ring's center stone is not too big, not too small. It's sized just right to catch eyes without being gawdy in the least. This ring has an antique look about it, and if you like that, and are a lover of silver,this ring is just right. I love the character of the band, with the tiny little stones artistically set around it.I have a real diamond wedding set, but I wear this one, because I honestly like it better!"

3,What can I add ?,"Grand Funk was literally created and at the time, hyped with a gigantic billboard in Times Square. No one really took them seriously, however despite their origins they still produced some ""catchy"" music."
4,GFR,"I have the greatest hits cd and the red cd and the live cd. I find myself listening to the red and live album most of the time since I prefer pre 1972 GFR, they changed their style after 72........"
1,"another victim of the ""Loudness Wars""",I bought this to replace my old c.1987 CD. Whoever re-mastered this must be deaf or only auditioned it on an iPod with cheezy earbuds! Bass is almost non-existant and everything else sounds tinny. Dynamic range is minimal due to WAY-TOO-MUCH COMPRESSION. I will buy an older release on eBay and donate this to Goodwill
5,Grand Funk Railroad,"I grew up with this music in the 70's. My son, mentioned he has fallenin love with this band, so I bought this for him. He says he loves it.Music from the 70's is soo much better than todays music. I thought itwas so cool my 28 year old son wanted music from my day!!!!"
3,Not the best of their stuff,This doesn't even scratch the surface of their great stuff. You can make a greatest hits just from their first two albums. Rated low for content.
3,Grand Funk,"Good product, came exactly how it was described. My issue was that it took over two weeks to get here. Not cool. Shipping should be free if its going to take that long."
2,Don't waste your money,GFR was not that great of a band back in the late sixties. Spend your money on better classic rock.
4,SALESIAN,"Many of the groups mentioned had their beginnings in the Salesian High School Rock n' Roll shows of the late 60's. Thee midnighter, Thee Enchantments, The Pharoahs, The Nightdreamers, Art and the Fabulons,Lil Art, the Counts, The Blue Satins, the impalas, The 4 x 4's, the Celestials, and many more. They grew into the Battle of the Bands of East L.A. The Showmen and The Majestics,who I roadied for, in the LATE 60' to the early 70's. Hank Castro of the Majestics still sings today at the Hop. An album, if you can get it, is the ""East Side Revue"" it was in yellow vinyl and black vinyl. It's a classic album."
3,Beacon St. Union only Fair compared to the THIRD ALBUM,"Unfortunately, most people who know Beacon Street Union don't know that the band made a third album, under the name EAGLE, called ""Come Under Nancy's Tent."" It was released in 1970 on Janus Records. This is a superb, hard-rockin' album of great guitar, impassioned vocals, and classic songs (""Snake in the Grass,"" ""Separated,"" and others). Akarma has released a vinyl LP reissue, but better yet is the out-of-print 3-CD box set that includes the BSU/Eagle recordings, called ""State Of The Union."" You should get this one."
3,EYES OF THE BEACON STREET UNION/CLOWN DIED IN MARVIN,"Part of the so called boss town sound which did not really exist,which was all lurid marketing by mgm at the time, to rival the sanfranscico sound.The beacon street union was caught up in all the hype which even though they sold quite well at the time music critics say did not help this group or others like them, who were being signed to the label at the time.The collection here is their first to lps which they recorded back in the late 60s,features some psych stuff ie Blue avenue but apart from this the collection is a mixed bag and some ot the songs are just rubbish.The cd comes with pictures of their first 2 lp covers plus a picture of them.I will only recomend this collection to fans of this phantom sound."
5,Worth the price for Duden alone!,"This is the first Natacha album I've heard, and it blew me away. I can't stop replaying Duden!!! The background music, the mandolin, and her sweetly enchanting voice form a melody that soothes your mind and begs you to replay it when it's done."
3,A little too dragged out,I think this book gave me more insight on the Rwanda genocide but it was so detailed that at times it felt like I was reading his diary.
5,The Days We Live In,"Shake Hands with the Devil is a revelation to everyone that life does have a price. If the Rwandan people had a natural resource, other countries wanted almost 1 million innocent people would not have died in 100 days. This tragedy could have been prevented if the international community at the political will to prevent it. Awesome book it is a great read."
1,Unreadable,"From what I understand, this book is supposed to have some substance. But I just couldn't read it as its terribly written. First of all, it has a distinct feeling of a log book: January 17, I did this, January 17 I did that, in March I flew to New York, etc. Its never highlighted what days and events are important. There are too many acronyms, and too many people to keep track of. The book reeks of bureaucratic, military jargon. There is no in-depth analysis, no sufficient background, - overall, its just bad writing.Overall, if you are looking for a good book on Rwandan genocide, do not buy this one. Its absolutely incomprehensible."
2,Should have been better,"This is a tragic story that needed to be told. Unfortunately, Dallaire should have used a ghost writer or someone like Mark Bowden to tell it. This reads just like a diary and is so burdened with needless details that the accounts of the genocide get lost in the mix. I found myself skimming whole chapters, and would put the book down for days before picking it up again. I'm capable of reading a 500 page book in 3-4 days, but it took me a month to get through this. If not for the subject matter, I wouldn't have finished it."
1,Really tried ot like this book,"After seeing the inspiring film ""Shake Hands with the Devil"" I ordered Dallaire's book on which the film was based. The man is in incredible hero and a true humanitarian but the book was so poorly written and boring that I did not finish it. In my entire life, the number of books I did not finish is less than five, but unfortunately this was one of them. Ponderus, filled with so much detail that the average reader will fall asleep. No photos to make you feel closer to the man, his colleagues and the Rwandans. Don't waste time with this book, but do view the film."
2,disappointing book,"someone wrote this review above, i want to second it. the book could have been a lot better, was quite disappointing. i got into the habit of skimming through a lot of pages at a time, the last hundred pages or so are the best and worth reading, the rest is just a quick skim.""From what I understand, this book is supposed to have some substance. But I just couldn't read it as its terribly written. First of all, it has a distinct feeling of a log book: January 17, I did this, January 17 I did that, in March I flew to New York, etc. Its never highlighted what days and events are important. There are too many acronyms, and too many people to keep track of. The book reeks of bureaucratic, military jargon. There is no in-depth analysis, no sufficient background, - overall, its just bad writing."""
5,Compelling and raw account of modern Rwandan history,"Lt. General Romeo Dallaire's book, ""Shake Hands with the Devil"" is an important and compelling book. His humanity, intelligence and compassionate leadership shines through what is clearly one of the most horrifying chapters of modern African and world history. The world needs more men and women of his personal integrity and humanity."
2,Surprisingly stiff,"Let me start by saying I am a recent Teva convert and have so far loved the sandals and shoes I purchased. These however left me wondering how they got their good reviews. They feel quite ""rugged"" and stiff. I cannot imagine wearing them without socks. The straps chafe and these are the worst sports sandals I have put on my feet. Otherwise, quality seems pretty good. If you want a really comfortable Teva sandal I recommend Teva Volterra Alp sports sandal."
2,Not as nice as my other Tevas,"I got these Tevas to replace my worn out ones. I don't know what the model was of the older ones, but they were the cheapest ones I could find at the time.When comparing the two, the straps are significantly narrower on the Pretty Rugged 2's, and they cut into my big toe. The velcro is as wide on both of them, but the soft foamy under side, under the velcro, was only as wide as the velcro on the new shoes. On the old shoes it was much wider and provided better padding from the velcro. Just wearing them a few minutes around the house left a red dent in my big toe.They have an interestingly springy sole which felt like it might be comfortable if I had kept the shoes, but the arch support felt less supporting.Also, the triangle shaped piece of plastic that holds the straps together at the ankle was much smaller and had less padding than my older Tevas."
5,Great quality Teva sandals!,"I finally broke down and ordered these Teva sandals after my almost 7 year old navy Pretty Rugged Tevas were finally wearing out. I was a bit skeptical seeing other brands that I have been loyal to selling out and making their products cheaply, therefore not good quality. However, these sandals are just as good as ever-this is my third purchase in twelve years of Teva sandals. Remarkable! They are comfortable, waterproof, and attractive to wear. I wear them to do everything from walking trails to the grocery store. I am a mother of two little ones, so I have to be comfortable! I highly recommend Teva sandals of all kinds. Not to mention the Amazon price was excellent-I got them for almost half the selling price! :-)"
3,I love my Teva's...BUT,"I have an active outdoor life and live in my Teva's, and I have been wearing Teva's as my primary footwear for the last 15yrs. I like them and haven't found a water sandal I like better, BUT I have been very discouraged with the sole of the sandal coming unglued from the footpad, it seems like the soles fall apart way before the sandal is worn out in any other way. I almost didn't get this pair because I was so frustrated by the short life of my last pair. I do find them comfortable, breathable, un-confining and ok to walk in when they are wet. When walking down steep hills with wet or muddy feet your feet can tend to slip out the front of the sandal, which wouldn't happen so much with a closed toe sandal. But the trade off is that with the open toe Pretty Rugged style pebbles that might get under your feet are easy to dislodge where as they have a tendency to rattle around in a closed toe sandal."
5,Great sandal,"I bought these sandals for an upcoming trip to Australia. I love the color, the treads and the fact that they are true to size."
2,"Disappointed, not worth the money","These are not worth the price! There's no workmanship involved. Its all velcro'd together with a rubber sole. Bands are not as wide as my other pair, which are universals. And I don't have the support as I did with my others. I've worn them 2 or 3 times and have had them for about 6 months. I just continue to glue the soles and where my old ones."
4,Nylon Teva review,"I have owned leather Tevas( no idea of the name) for 3 years and think that they are the most comfortable shoes ever! However, they can't be worn with socks because of the leather piece around the big toe. I wanted to find Tevas that would accommodate socks. The ""Pretty Rugged Nylon 2"" sandal works fine. I have worn them with and without socks and they are comfortable...not as wonderful as the leather Tevas, but quite acceptable. I liked the reasonable price too! Reviewed by Candy not Rich."
1,Waxy substance on disk,"The second disk of the five-disk set has a waxy substance on it which prevents it from playing. It was not cleanable. Too late to return it, as I bought it in advance and gave it as a gift."
1,"Loved the books, not so much the show.","More like the Legendary Disappointment. The books were great, I wish the script writers had followed them a little more closely and I'm not sure who cast ""Richard"" but EPIC FAIL to them."
5,"Mord Sith are not born, the're broken","""Mord Sith are not born, the're broken. Every one of them starts out as an innocent little girl and Cara was no different.""""Broken"" is one of my favorite episodes. This episode focuses of Cara Mason and how she came to be a Mord Sith. ""Broken"" also focuses on the power of forgiveness, remorse, and justice. In this episode Kahlan Amnell must use her authority as Mother Confessor to decide Cara's fate. There is a twist however, Cara was one of the Mord Sith that killed Kahlan's sister and nephew when she (Cara) was serving Darken Rahl. In this episode Kahlan has to choose between her desire for vengeance and justice. Will she do her duty as Mother Confessor and choose justice or will she choose to avenge her sister and nephew?"
4,review,"I enjoyed the whole series it's so much better than Merlin and more ""Lord of The Rings"", it has a wide field of adventures, and the main characters are diverse"
2,The CDs have tracking problem,"There are 5 CDs in it and all 5 have the same tracking problem. We have to push pause or stop and play every 8-10 minutes. First, I thought my machine was broken, but after I tried the third VCR, the problem obviously came from the CDs."
5,its not the books but...,"Yes, we know it not the books but if you set that aside it's a great adventure TV show with great action! I pre ordered mine because I could not wait to get it! Love the music!!!! And the costumes!"
5,Legend Of The Seeker,"This show was the best TV show I ever seen, I hope that they would make a season 3 or season 4 with it because it can't end the way it end... Because for one thing I need to know what happened to Richard and Kaylin Did they get married or did he or she died? I already have the first season and about to buy the second season when it comes out on Sept. 28, 2010. So please and I hope that you do a 3rd and 4th season so that I could buy all 4 of them with a good ending like Richard and Kaylin got married with a son that turned out to be good and not evil... Thank you and I hope that you get this letter of mine.."
5,Makes TV worth watching again,"So much of television is such crap and when I first came across the airing of ""Legend of the Seeker"" it immediately caught my attention. I of course, wanted more! Imagine a show that doesn't have bad language, and is for the most part a pretty wholesome show to watch. Season two has so much suspense and action and it really would be a shame for it to end there. This is the best fantasy program I have watched in years and watching it over again just adds to the joy of good entertainment.I'm sorry, but there are so many TV shows that cause me to 'turn off' the television, why can't they air one that makes me want to watch TV again?"
5,Amazing!!,"LOTS is an amazing TV show! I read all the books and even though the show is different I still loved it! I can't believe they probably won't make a season 3 with all the horrible shows they run on TV! However, even if there is no season 3 its still worth watching because its a great show! The actors, effects, storylines, and locations are all amazing- it was like watching a great movie every week!"
5,AMAZING SHOW!,"Everything about this show is amazing! Filming is incredible, characters are lovable, and plot very entertaining. This is a great show for anyone interested in fantasy / action-adventure and I would recommend to all. The only bad part is that it is only 2 seasons long =("
5,"Legend of the Seeker, AMAZING","Legend of the Seeker (LOTS)i so one of the best shows on television. No, it is the BEST. Although the show doesn't follow the exact storylines from the brilliant Goodkind books they still are amazing. The actors feel real and the chemistry between Kahlan and Richard is extrodinary and pure. I would recomend this show to anyone, if your into Lord of the Rings then it is def a show for you. I have been emailing FOX and other various television stations to fight for a third season. Join the pitition today!! LOTS is an amazing different show and I wish that everyone would watch it."
5,"Did I Say Greatest Show on TV, I Meant Greatest Show Ever!!!","If the first season was awesome you have to make up a new word to describe the epicness of the second season. The addition of Tabbrett Bethell took the show over the top. Every scowl, every glare will make you love her even more.If you thought fighting a tyrannical dictator wasn't epic enough how about fighting the keeper of the underworld himself. Zombies, a more powerful Kahlan, sisters of the dark and light, striving to save the world of the living from death itself, and even more hot girls in skintight leather.This second season just kept getting better and I can't wait to get it. Why ABC/Disney did not renew is beyond any kind of reason.Join the fight to Save Our Seeker!!! [....]"
4,Love this watch,"Only worn it a couple of times, but I love this watch for a weekend watch or at the pool, the beach, this watch just fits my life style for all the water sports that I enjoy during the summer"
2,you get what you pay for,"Got this for 65 on Amazon. I'm fairly tough with watches and both the bezel and 'glass' scratched within a month. A short time later the thin circular metal bezel with inscribed #'s actually popped off the watch. I successfully superglued it back on, which appeared to be the factory method of attachment. I then purchased a citizen diver for about double the money and not surprisingly got a watch that has twice the quality."
1,worst watch ever,"Im a Sheriff Deputy and am on the county search and recovery dive team. I have been using a Casio dive watch as my every day watch and diving for the last 5 years. It was time to replace the battery and the band so I decided to step up and purchase a new watch. Heard that the Invicta pro diver was a good watch so I bought one. 1 week after I got it we were on a dive mission at a local lake. After my second dive the watch fogged up and couldn't see the dial. Three days later it was still fogged up and quit running. I would not recommend this watch to anyone who actually uses a watch to dive. I'm going back to wal-mart and getting another Casio. Invicta is on my desk, think I'll take it to the rifle range and give it a proper burial."
1,"Lost time, fogged up.",Liked the look of the watch but it lost at least five to fifteen minutes a week which was annoying. 'Pro-diver Collection' might be a bit of a misnomer as water has leaked in and the condensation on the interior face makes it difficult to read.
2,Not Dependable,"Have owned other diver's watches. Use them during work outs, running, informal wear. This the second Invicta I've owned. First one went bad when crown was not screwed in correctly (it stripped early and took in moisture, fogging the crown).I ""dropped"" this one -- minor spill off a counter at the gym. The second hand came off and jammed the movement. After paying $90, really don't want to spend $25 just to send it away and see if it can be fixed.Plan to stay from Invicta and look at more reputable -- and dependable -- brands. This one's not for me."
2,D.O.A. Exactly ONE year almost to the day,"Sadly, the markers inside the watch, came lose and stopped the watch cold. The Invicta company only covers the watch for a year, and it makes no sense to send it back. Besides having to keep it wound all the time, my husband stated that the band was very unforgiving and uncomfortable. This is the third Invicta watch that I have had, and two of them are now no longer worth what they were paid for. It is very unfortunate because, the Invicta watches actually look so nice, but unfortunately, they just don't stand the test of time! (Pun intended). However, we also purchased a Citizen Eco Drive watch on the same day, and these watches are PHENOMENAL. They look great, and stand up to daily wearing, without losing time."
5,Great watch!,"This is really a great watch for the price. I have had the watch for about 3/4 weeks and here are some thoughts...Pros:-automatic movement is so nice to have!-Great size-all quality parts-watch hands glow great in the darkCons:-watch band is a little big but still fits me. this is understandable though cause it is a dive watch and is supposed to be worn outside wet suits-automatic movement is a little fast... this isn't a huge problem though, i've just had to readjust it once every 2 weeks.-the watch is a bit on the thick sideI have gotten a lot of compliments from this watch and am loving it so far. This is really a great watch and should be added to one's collection!"
4,Excelente compra,"Me pareció un excelente producto en su relación precio/calidad, elegí la opción de correa de resina porque imaginé que la correa metálica sería de menor calidad que la que proyecta el reloj. En resumen, lo recomiendo."
1,Dont waste your Cash!,"These watches are not worth the Price, You can get a Seiko diver for the same money here on Amazon.They have a high Failure rate and the Lunimuos stuff isn't very!I have tried 3 of them, and returned them all."
4,Compliments compliments compliments,"This watch is awesome, I had many watches include Seiko, Citizens and Swiss Army but this one calls everyones attention. I never before was told that is a nice watch actually not even noticed like with this one.Quality excellent the mecanical seems to work fine gives me the time.Accuracy I haven't notice any delays compare to my computer watch both home and work. I know have this Item for 2 weeks love it I am know want to buy another Invicta same style just a Stailess steel brazalett for a more dressier look. But this is now my favorite will report when get my next one."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This is not a good watch. The crown is a mess and is not water resistant. Wasted my money. The glass is all foggy after going to the beach once.I'm buying a Seiko, like I should have bought instead of this."
2,Failed the open water test,"I purchased this for my husband as a gift. The fit and finish of the piece is top notch and as expected. the watch performed fine, until we went snorkeling. He dove down 10-15' to check out a starfish and when he emerged the watch was filled with water.The face of the watch indicates water resistance to 200m. It should have most definitely handled a quick up and down to 10 feet or so. We are going to have to deal with invicta to see if we can have the unit replaced with a fully functional one; if not we will be replacing it outright with an actual dive watch.it's a shame because it really was a good looking timepiece."
2,This is identical to an old Sears Craftsman router table,"I bought this same table 17 years ago from Sears. The plastic bit guard was red instead of clear and there was no miter gauge. I still have it and use it outside when I have projects larger than my shop can handle; I clamp it to a couple of saw horses. It holds the router tightly and if I fiddle with the ""fence"" long enough it will line up well enough to do simple jobs. The fence is maybe 1 1/2 inches high. Where does this have a place? If you need a) portability, b) the most basic of basic ways to hold your router upside down beneath a small table, and c) you don't want to build a simple jig yourself. I suppose you could make your own fence and use the screws and wing nuts to hold it to the table, but if you can build yourself a fence why would you bother with this?"
4,Pretty good,"This cream is ""almost"" as good as ""First Aid Cream"" but I still miss J & J First Aid Cream"
1,Suspicious reader,"No points, no correctness, no validation, no value!What the hell is this book for? Is it just a manifestation that free software is bad?"
5,Can a song get any more 'PIMP' than this one?,"What I mean in my title by 'PIMP' is that this here song by Truth Hurts ""Addictive"" is one of the most up-beat jamz of my time! This songs haz' got it all in my opinion. If y'all lookin' for a way cool method to get your blood pumpin' or even get those lovehandles a lot slimmer then buy this way cool CD SINGLE TODAY cuz' it's gunna' make y'all sweat!"
1,Lancome Eye Liner,I would not recommend this eyeliner. Would spread all around your eyes and will get inside your eyes and hurt. I am very surprise as most of the time the cosmetiques I got from Lancolm has been very good.
1,"GREAT READING , BUT A BOOTLEG COPY","THIS TRULY A GREAT BOOK , WHERE DOES AMAZON GET OFF ON SELLING UNAUTHORIZED COPIES OF A PUBLISHED BOOK , FOR SURE IT'S A BOOTLEG COPY ,THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE , WITH ANOTHER BOOK "" OUR LADY OF KIBEHO"" BY IMMACULEE , LEARN MY LESSON BUY IT AT BARNES AND NOBLE NEXT TIME , WHEN BUYING A BOOK IT'S NICE TO HAVE AUTHENTICITY , THIS BOOK WAS GREAT READING , BUT FALSE COPY"
1,Racist Ideologies wrapped in a PhD,"This book is horrible. It's hard to believe that anyone could in any way justify the slaughter and enslavement of millions of Native people, but this author found a way. Definitely not a text I would use in a scholarly setting, as the author supports the idea that the Natives were enslaved because they ""worshipped the Devil."" The author and his magical theories reflect the racist, Christian/Euro-centric ideologies so prevalent in America.This book is offensive, but good for a laugh and reality check as to the state of racism in academia and America."
5,Our Lady of Guadalupe and the Conquest of Darkness,"The riveting history of a great man, Hernan Cortes, who with 300 men conquered the demonic empire of 14 million Aztecs who had ritualistic human sacrifices of ripping out live human hearts on top of their pyramid in Mexico City. Naturally he had circumstantial Divine help and great courage. What man destroys his own means of escape (he sank his vessels) and turns to face odds of 46,000 to 1? Then a few years later the miraculous appearance of Our Lady and huge conversions. Some were still carrying on human sacrifices in secret til Our Lady came. Greatest book I've found in years, excellent for young men to read about heroism and faith. Some ladies may be turned off by the barbaric cruelty and cannibalism of the Aztecs, but it gives great perspective as to the evil that had to be conquered. It is also one of my wife's favorite books and we have gone through 4 as I continue to give it to others."
2,old time vernacular,"I figured the author must be around 108 years old. She uses the term ""Oriental"" thru the book (as another reviewer mentioned). That word went out of favor/fashion a couple of decades ago. Also the author refers to the Japanese as ""Japs."" Holy, moly. How old is the author? That term was never OK."
3,Kind of predictable,turned off the whole series. Not as interesting as Shelton's Samantha Sweet series. It was too fast a read for me.
4,Loved this one,This is my second Charlie Parker Mystery can't wait to read the next one in the series in the near future.
4,Holds your interest,Connie Shelton rights an interesting day by day on her investigations and frustrations. She puts in a spice of romance but not too graphic. Her characters are believable.
3,fun light read,"A fun story that is consistant with the first one. Gives hope that we will be able to watch the characters develop. Although I didn't find the setting believable, perhaps the author hasn't been there, it was still well worth reading. I will be reading the third just to see what troubles Charlie falls into next."
3,Having Issues,"i enjoyed the first in this series. it was a fun read. a bit long with tedious info but fun. the second is giving me issues. shelton refers to a group of people as oriental. um oriental are rugs not people! it's asian! it's a pet peeve, i know, but i don't know if i can make it through. might just skip and read the end....."
4,What happens to Ron's kids?,"Probably beside the point but she mentions Ron having three children in this book. Paul has the wonderfully obnoxious Annie and Joe in ""Deadly Gamble"" (the worse a character is the better Shelton draws him). I started with ""Partnerships Can Kill"" and I don't remember Ron's children in that. Only one dog, with a walk-on part. Great scenery and Hawaii travelogue and helicopter lore. Long speeches by the murderer...are a little unconvincing."
5,Great Country Compilation,"This is a great compilation that any true country fan would enjoy. It includes Vince Gill, Reba, Trisha Yearwood, and many other great singers. My favorite song is ""Please Come to Boston,"" but I didn't like the ""Starting Over"" album. I was pleased to see it on this CD."
5,Excellent -- Jennings delivers again,"Telling Tales is an outstanding collection of moving stories about being gay in school. Kevin Jennings has proven himself as an editor with his earlier book, One Teacher in Ten, and he delivers again here. It is relevant to anyone interested in gay and lesbian studies and/or education."
2,Not So Hot,"After reading ""Farm Boys"", this book didn't compare. ""Farm Boy's"" was genuine and from the heart stories of growing up on a farm. ""Telling Tales Out of School"" I think was everyone's attempt to write. They all could have been stories for magazines, etc. They seemed to want to make their stories humorous, and/or then they all wanted to be radical homosexuals and save others. I don't need that. I just wanted to compare stories. I got nothing from it and scanned most of the stories after reading the first few. And I certainly did not care to read any of the stories from lesbians."
4,"Funky, up-beat pop!","This is S Club 7's second single, and it's just as good as their first. Their happy-go-lucky style is bound to get you dancing! A must for all pop music fans."
4,Pretty good sampler; missing vital tunes,"This is a decent sampler, but the ommision of ""Well...Allright"" and ""Crying, Waiting, Hoping"" is just unforgivable. The 2-CD ""Buddy Holly Collection"" has those two, plus several other excellent songs (as well as some early, not-so-great stuff). Someday, someone will produce the definitive single-CD Buddy collection for U.S. consumption."
5,Definitive Holly,"If you don't know Buddy Holly's music, you really should familiarize yourself with it. Bottom line: it is masterful and definitive early rock n' roll. This album offers a fantastic way of getting to know some of the very best music that came from this amazing musician. I highly recommend purchasing and devouring this album before getting one of the latest tribute albums to MR. Holly's music. Those albums are good, but will not do justice to hearing the songs in their original form. Highly recommended!"
5,50s could rock,"This is an excellent compilation of Buddy Holly's songs and proof that the 50s were not square. This is fast rock and roll, not heavy or angry, but definitely not sickly sweet lite stuff either. This belongs in your CD player, not the dentist's office. And to think he got all this done before he died in a plane crash at 23. Wow."
4,"Probably the Best ""Greatest Hits"" for Holly","This is a good album to get a feel for what Buddy Holly's music was like. I'm old enough to have had the original 45 of ""Oh Boy."" There are some mediocre songs because Holly was prolific but not necessarily discriminating. You can really hear the tremendous influence he had on the Beatles. Personally I don't think Holly would have survived the ""British Invasion."" He was already moving away from true rock as evidenced by his last songs. Like Bobby Darin he was caught between singing rock and wanting to be a cabaret singer."
5,Don McLean was WRONG...,"THE MUSIC NEVER DIED!! Get this cd now!! You'll marvel at the fact that Buddy Holly was so young but so talented. We all remember PEGGY SUE...MAYBE BABY...and THAT""LL BE THE DAY. But the hidden treasures like THINK IT OVER...FOOL'S PARADISE...and HEARTBEAT show that music would be completely different today if Buddy Holly had lived. Elvis was king, but Buddy was the heir apparent!!!"
1,Very Bad,This game has hardly any game modes.There is no carrer modeIts impossible to get upThe buttons are to over complicated for the pspYou get tired after about 3 punches and you have already lost staminaAll animations are the sameNo bloodGraphics? The boxers look like cartoon charichters! Rocky was so much better on ps2
5,if only...,If they only carried on...anyway this cd just rules over everything you have ever heard. Think Dark side of the oon mixed with piper at the gates of dawn mixed with surealistc pillow...and take away the guitar and add tons of anti acid drenched synth...
5,A Mind Trip of Its Own,"As a child of the 50s, I was a young adult in the 60s... one who graduated college and got into the work force a year or two BEFORE the psychedelic age hit. I was too busy making a living and trying to achieve something in my profession to take the time to experiment with drugs... much less drop out and join in. That being said, I was still able to take a lot of little head trips without drugs, through the arts, and when a friend brought us this LP, I was totally blown away! What a great album! Even today, more than 40 years later, I LOVE this album and continue to listen to it. The lyrics still apply, the music is great, and the arrangements were way ahead of their time. It's one of my all time top ten albums forever!"
5,Outstanding!,"One of the most entertaining albums i've ever heard. It is chock full of suprises! It is unbelievable to me that Tailor Man was left off the album. To me, it is one of the better songs to have been recorded in the late 60's! The entire album never ceases to delight the listener."
4,Great old cd,"I first saw this album,yes I am that old, when I was in high school. Never bought it but saw it somewhere recently and decided to check it out. I remember it being pretty radical for it's time. I really love this cd!! It's quirky,bizarre,challenging and very enjoyable. I find myself listening to it a lot lately. For those who like a musical challenge, I would say pick it up"
1,Treason,"Sub-par. Amatuerish. Girl can sing, but doesn't sound like she knows what she's singing, kind of like you get your girlfriend of chorale class and ask her to sing on your rock album. Where the guitar? Lot of noise, not much continuity. For historians only. Want to listen to bad rock experiments, try the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band volume 3."
2,Curious footnote,"At their best, the Fool (named after the tarot card) sounded like a cross between the Rolling Stones' ""Sing This All Together"" and the Whoville harmony singing in the animated version of Dr Seuss's ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas."" At their worst they were out of tune, with no melody and little rhythm to hang onto as they meandered through long stretches of aimless bagpipes and tamborines. Perhaps producer Graham Nash could have hired a drummer, as the bonus tracks that have one are at least as good as the album itself. The lyrics are pointless (dated even in 1968) but positive, an amusingly naive artifact from a fun period."
4,A Resurgance of Rock,These guys really now how to put out great album. I have travled all over the country and still haven't found a band that are not only great musicians but great proformers. This has to be the best small label album I've heard in the past year.
4,Jubilee,"This is a real oldie and includes groups singing from the 1970s. If you like seeing how your favourite groups looked like 40 years ago then this is for you. Ever seen Mark Lowry when he was about 12 singing? Bill and Les Beasley introduce a lot of the old gospel groups and the songs, while all in black and white, still are entertaining to watch."
4,Very detailed book,"The author does a very good job of presenting all the details without repeating himself. There are times where the action drags a bit, but there aren't a lot of spots like that.The book really shows how close France came to losing the war due to these mutinies. The author lays the blame squarely on the French political and military leadership for their incompetence in waging war. The strategy of simply sending men charging into the German gun positions was a complete failure and caused many needless deaths.This book gives a much different perspective on WWI that you normally don't see."
4,Great for dinosaur fans,"This is a great toy for kids who love dinosuars and learning about fossils. I let mine work on this out side because the sand gets every place. My kids thought it was great and ran to show me each piece of the dinosaur they found. I encouraged them to work at removing the sand at a level pace across the top. This really extended the play time for this toy. My kids are 4 and 8, great for this age range. The only reason it gets 4 stars is because the sand flies every where when they are chipping away at it."
2,A big MESS!!,"This ""toy"" created a huge dirt mess all over my kitchen floor - I guess it should only be used outside. the block has to be smashed with great force and that causes dirt, etc to fly all over the place. And then you are left with junk - my 7-year-old was done with it at that point. Not much educational value, but good exercise for the arms!"
4,There Are Two Versions of This Knob,I was given a Fender Champ 25se guitar amplifier that had a number of controls that were either bent or broken off with two knobs missing. These Fender 099-0932-000 knobs fit the D shaft but are 180 degrees off. They do however work on the Fender BXR60 bass amp. I'm still looking for knobs the Champ 25se.
4,works fine for me,"the photos and write up weren't all that clear to me, but this little battery charger is just fine, especially for the price. the integral fold-away prongs and overall small size are a plus if you travel a lot and need space. a lot of little parts, but those parts allow you to use it in your car or with dc current. seems a good value for the money, not sure how long it will last. not a really firm grip while in the receptacle, but whatever, for the money."
4,Works Great @ home and in the car!!,The charger works as well as the original. The only negative is that it is slightly larger than the original equipment. But the best part is that it comes with a car charger built in as well.
2,"Quick, but Not the Item I Expected","This item arrived promptly, but was absolutely useless to me as it was a European plug and a plug that hooks into a car's cigarette lighter port. As I live in NYC, both of these things mean nothing to me. It would've cost more than it was worth to send it back and order something else."
1,Defective,"The plug rotates out to connect to the wall socket, but with the two of these that I purchased (one original and one replacement) the plug makes no connection with the inside. (I verified this with an ohm meter). So the devices did not do anything when plugged into the wall. They did work fine with the cigarette lighter plug."
2,It worked until it didn't,"Okay, you get what you pay for. I bought this item in May 2010 and it worked until March 2011. Then it would partially charge and then show the green light indicating ""charged"" but the battery wasn't really charged, or the red light would stay on for a couple of days and it just wouldn't charge at all, blah blah blah. I just ordered the Nikon charger, which cost about four times more but I'm assuming it will last longer."
2,Not quite what I ordered,"I ordered this product thinking I would get a little adapter to let me use it in Italy, where I am traveling next month. When it came, it did not look like the one in the picture, and did not have the little European adapter thing in the picture either. I think I got something that's closer to the Dolica DN-CEL1 charger.It does, however, charge my battery, and is cheaper than the Nikon version, so I don't think I will send it back.It is possible that the product sent is not same as the one ordered. Hopefully this was a system mistake, though its doubtful."
5,great book,"just the book we wanted-great condition-older version, but basically the same (kind of fun to see old pictures)-good shipping as far as packing & timing"
5,A Great Resource,I used this wedding planner in 1996 when my husband and I were married. It is full of resources that you might not think to use. I lost my copy in one of our moves and have returned to get a copy for reference...I highly recommend this book to any bride-to-be. It will be the best $17 you spend for your wedding.
3,Dated & Lacking,"This book SEEMED like it would be helpful, but except for *some* info on premarital counseling, it really came very close to being like any other *secular* wedding book. Some of the advice is really dated, too."
2,Lawrence isn't the greatest practicioner of all time....,"Even though hes not so great at tai chi his book is important for historical reasons as one of the early western tai chi books, influenced by Cheng Man-ching. Serious artists will need it, but non-fanatics can just as well pass it up..."
2,Uninspired,Felt like dozing off after first twenty pages. Photographs were unclear and hard to follow in black and white. A bit of colour and directional arrows would have helped. Am reluctant to look at the thing again. Certainly not a teach yourself book!
5,AWESOME BOOK,"This is such an awesome book written by a young, Christian writer, with a very bright future in Christian Fiction."
3,Horse People: Scenes from the Riding Life,Korda admits that he isn't one of those who get dirty or rush out to the barn kind of people.He does give us a whimsical look at horses in another light and stories of other horse people he has met or talked to around the country.This wasn't a great book nor a bad one but was enjoyable.
3,A Mixed Review,"I'm of two minds about this book. As a lifelong horsewoman, I found many of his characterizations of the horse world and the horsey set right on the money. And I laughed out loud with recognition as I read some of his accounts of his experiences on and around horses. This is all to his credit, as most books about horses seem to be written by people who lack real experience with the animals themselves. On the other hand, his condescending, smug persona, repetitiveness, and self-righteousness is a real turn-off. One wonders what his wife sees in him, especially since it turns out that he is actually pretty indifferent about horses. Perhaps he explains it best when he mentions (repeatedly) that he is very good at writing checks. I'm glad that I borrowed this book rather than having paid for it."
4,A down to earth portrayal of the wealthy horsey-set,"As a fellow horse owner, but not part of the more ""blue-blooded horsey set"" I felt the lifestyle described by author Michael Korda, was well written and as down-to-earth as you could possibly get for someone writing from a more priveleged background than most. Despite the fact most of us cannot relate with the ultimate equestrian lifestyle portrayed, the story is written with a love and respect that all who are passionate about horses can relate to. The picturesque landscape that Korda spells out in his recollections of ""Sunday Rides"" in Central Park and later in the countryside of NY make for great daydreams, especially to a desert horseperson like myself. Our ""Sunday rides"" include cactus, tumbleweed and an occasional dust storm or two. After reading this book, my day dreams have a bit more color to them and I can look at the blue-blooded horsey set without envy, but mutual respect for sharing an equal passion in horses."
5,Best horse book ever! And I've read them all!,"Michael Korda captures the mystique and grace of horses and their relationship with humans like none other. As a lifelong rider, I found that Mr. Korda somehow put into words the difficult-to-describe emotions that horses evoke in people. This book had the rare ability to make me laugh and cry in the same chapter. I highly recommend this book, and it is not just for horse people!"
5,a great author on a great subject!!,"I first fell in love with Michael Korda's work when I picked up ""Country Matters"" and could not put it down. This book did not disapoint. The stories he shares made me laugh, made me tear up, and to read his book is to know how deeply those of us involved with horses love them. There are not enough words to describe how much I enjoyed this book. I only hope that he keeps writing! If you like horses, or even if you don't; don't miss this fantastic book by the one of the grestest writers of our time."
2,horsey circles,"As a lover of horses and non-rich person, this book gave me a rotten feeling in the pit of my stomach throughout the reading it. Every time I tried to relax into it, it unfailingly reminded me of all the things I-- as the kid of a cop and a homemaker-- could never afford, of all the snubs from all the snobs who ever looked down on me from astride their bright and shiny sixteen-plus hand birthday presents. It reads a lot more like a documentary of the lives of the rich and horsey than the penetrating look into relationships between horses and people I was hoping for. As a perpetually cash-strapped owner of two western horses, and a lifetime lover of all the rest of them, this book left me as flat as day old soda.Excellent reading however, for the neuveau riche who want to pretend they're old money."
4,Heart wrenching,"I couldn't put it down. I recently lost a dear friend to cancer and reading this brought back a lot of memories. Very real depection of what the disease does, but the story of the family was beautiful. The story highlights things we take for granted until we start to lose it. Beautifully written."
4,Book Club assignment,"This book was a Book Club selection. It was not what I expected, from reading the reviews of others. It started out on the first page of the daughter being in jail for killing her mother. I had a feeling that it was not the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. It was not as sad as one would have thought it would be. It was more of the relationship between the mother and daughter and also the father and brothers. I am glad that I read it. It will be interesting to see what others thought about the plot when we meet for book club."
2,Moments of brilliance. Boring in between.,"Having just experienced losing two family members to cancer, my review may be bias. I wanted to like this book. Appreciated the realistic aspects of the relationship between daughter and mother being affected by illness and death: The struggles, growth, family dysfunction etc. However, this section of the book was somewhat static after awhile. It just kinda lingered too long without much blossoming. The writing did hold my interest in part I, but I was not "" loving it."" I can not say the same for part II. Boring. I did not care about the main character. The author went out of her way to make the reader dislike or feel indifferent. If you hang in...the prologue is very well written and is the best part of this book. I gave this book 2 stars because 50% of it is very boring."
3,"Interesting plot, but very simple characters","I bought this book when I saw Meryl Streep sing its praises in a TV interview. While the plot was intriguing, I found the characters to be too simple to be realistic. For example, Ellen is categorized as a power-hungry, over-achiever who is not in touch with her feelings, period. Ms. Quindlen seems to present no softness in her through much of the novel, and no one can be that one-dimentional. I felt that if the characters had been more complex and not ""pigeon-holed,"" the novel would have been much more tangible. While it had its high points, (Ellen holding her mother's hand and listening to her gurgling final breaths on the night of her death) on the whole it left me untouched."
5,I wish every book was like One True Thing...,"One true thing got me hooked from the very first time is saw the preview for the upcoming September Meryl Streep/Renee Zellweger movie. I went to a New York City bookstore ""Books Started with Papyrus"" with high hopes. To my excitment, I found the last copy, and finished it in three days. I would have finished it in one night, except I wanted it to last. Anna Quindlin is a goddess and she should be awarded for this masterpiece. As it turns out, to my surprise, not only have I enjoyed, but so did my Grandmother! I hope she watched over me, reading every word with me, enjoying her twelve year old grandson she never had a chance to know. Everyone should read this!!!!"
3,"Like Camus' ""The Stranger,"" only humanized","After reading this book, one can see a similarity between it and Albert Camus' ""The Stranger."" The main difference being that Anna Quilden has humanized her story and her protagonist. The problem that lies here though is that in ""The Stranger,"" the plot was necessary to convey the theme of the novel, whereas with Quilden, the trial section does not add to the initial part of the novel, but only detracts from one of the most emotionally fueled sections ever written. Ellen, the protagonist, goes through a 100 more pages which increase the affinity of the reader for her, but takes away from the overall plot."
5,A book that leaves me speechless,"Yes, I saw the movie first. Then I knew I had to read the book.I read this book in 2 days. Rarely do books move me to cry, but this one did. The complicated fabric of this family & the seperate relationships inside of it- there are no words.Quindlen is a wonderful author. She really puts you into the characters frame of mind. You can understand what they are feeling. She did an excellent job with a topic that is so over-written about as of late. She did a great job of describing what happens to someone who is dying of cancer- an honest portrayal. I also enjoyed Black & Blue."
5,A true to life must read,"Never having read any novels by Anna Quindlen before, I expected the usual movie/book shallowness. I was not only pleasantly surprised but overwhelmed with the realism of the situation in the book.I cared for my mother as she slowly wasted away from cancer of the esophagus. The experience was one of the worst in my life. Like the character, we were never close, I married at 15 to escape the alcoholism that was rampant in my family.I never considered that the experiences that I went through with my Mom are not unusual and this book has forced me to realize that I am still carrying a lot of unresolved emotional baggage over something that could not be helped but was part of the normal process of dying.I will be recommending this book but I'm keeping my copy!"
3,"Touching, gripping, but flawed","As others have said, this is an excellent book. Remarkable, well-written, graceful and sincere.However, it is flawed by the fact that the characters don't quite ring true. Ellen comes across as much too mature for 24 or so -- not so much in emotional terms, more in terms of being worldly, confident and overly wise -- and her father's much-vaunted charm is never really in evidence much. Her mother is just sooo good and talented and dignified and gracious it's sickening. (Not only that but of course she's actually smarter and capable of much better original thought than her learned husband. Of course!).It's just totally unbelievable that Ellen would have been so attached to her father and so uninterested in her mother.Otherwise a good read and psychologically interesting."
4,good and sad,"This book was beautifully written, engrossing, and I truly couldn't put it down until I finished. However, it was so utterly depressing. It wasn't the kind of sad that was a tear-jerker, I actually didn't cry. Rather, after finishing it I just felt depressed, and felt as though it left me hanging."
3,"Heart-touching story, but that's about it","I just finished reading ""One True Thing"" a story of an overachieving daughter coerced to move back home to care for her terminally ill mother. I found the story itself as a whole very moving, but Ms. Quindlen's writing abilities somewhat lagging. I found it difficult to put the overall story into sequential order. The time plots jumped around from paragraph to paragraph. I was expecting a book that I could read in a few days, maybe a week, instead I found a book that I felt a need to finish in order to start another book. Her words didn't keep me longing for the next page, nor did I get as emotional as I thought I would. Overall, I would recommend the book to those who are easily moved. If you are looking for an unbelievingly touching, kleenex-reaching book however, I would search elsewhere because this one won't do the job."
5,A very thought provoking novel !!!!!,"I really enjoyed this book. Of course the subject matter is not enjoyable (terminal illness), however the way her daughter was able to transform her character from a self-centered egotist to a compassionate woman seemed to make the journey more bearable. As a stay-at-home mom, I found it heartwarming that her daughter could come to respect and appreciate her mother and eventually chose a career based on that realization."
3,A movie of the week saved by good writing.,"A dying mother and the daughter called back home to become her nurse, get an opportunity to forge the relationship that they never had before. Add in a mercy killing murder accusation and you have a the blueprint for a ""heart wrenching tale of love and loss."" What saves this book from drowning in movie of the week pathos is the writing of Quindlen, who skillfully creates strong characters and believable dialogue. The problem is the plot is still has the basic components of a ""tearjerker"" and even Quindlen can't overcome that. Still, it moves well and the basic testament to the healing power of love can't be faulted."
5,This is one of the most powerful books I have ever read,"My mother died 5 years ago of a rare neuromuscular disease; it took 7 years. While she had my father at the time and a 24 hour a day caretaker, I was instrumental in taking care of her as well. The story, the characters and the relationship that I had with my mother and father and the relationship that my sister had with my parents made this magnificent book even more poignant for me. It is a superb piece of writing. It has had a profound effect on me and now, having just seen the movie, I am quite moved. Anna Quindlen is not just a writer; she is a philosopher and all I can say is thank God for Anna Quindlen.Cynthia Adler Luzon"
4,"cancer--""One Terrible Thing""","This book was most disturbing. The actual description of the progress of this terrible disease kept me awake all night.The development of Ellen's relationship with her mother was a small reward for reliving the death of a family member from cancer.The theme of disfunction of a family certainly doesn't change when cancer appears.When a book can affect me for days after,I realize that the book has touched me!"
1,An implausible syrupy tear-jerker for Quindlen sycophants.,"The Quindlen characters are unbelieveably one dimensional, and Quindlen is transparently self-serving. I have worked with terminally ill people for the past 8 years, and I've never encountered anything like this story. The suffering and the pain (both physical and emotional) of cancer patients and their loved ones is real, complex and completely beyond anything Anna Quindlen has ever imagined. Quindlen has cheapened their stories by writing this obvious ""book-to-be-optioned-immediately-for-the-movies."" Quindlen should donate her immense profits to the national hospice movement."
3,"Decent ending, but thin, weak storytelling along the way","I picked up this book after hearing it mentioned on NPR -- the story of a daughter faced with euthanasia issues with a dying mother sounded interesting. Yet, except for a slight twinkle at the end, it was not a very stimulating read. While a real life situation like the one in the book would be terribly deep and heavy, the book felt surprisingly light and fluffy. This was not a bad book, say like ""A Man in Full,"" but it was a little weak."
1,Don't bother,Written and published in England. What can they possibly tell us about the Harley? Good pictures of antique bikes and a decent history that is not up to date.
5,engaging series,Brilliant TV series of the lives of the firemen and families of 62 Truck how they dealt with life in New York post 9/11. Heartfelt and very involved with getting on with the job.well worth watching and owning.
3,Too In Love With Itself,"I watched it on cable. I watched it on Netflix. It comes up the same = lacking. Not that it doesn't have good moments. It does, but it tries way too hard to have an edge where an edge does not exist. Nor could one be made up. Would that it could because ""Rescue Me"" could really use one - whether it's Tommy or Garrity or any other character. It could have been a VERY good show, but ends up in the mediocre middle between Cop Rock and NYPD Blue."
5,Great end to great show,"This has been by far my most favorite show of the last few years. This show consistently showed a ton of heart, had some laughs, and really put forth characters I was interested in caring about week to week. I have every season and find myself watching all the episodes repeatedly. Bring this home and grab a seat!"
5,One of my favorites,This show has managed to go 7 seasons without losing it's touch. I have enjoyed this from the first episode to the last. I love this show!
3,Review of Rescue Me - Kicking up the Ashes,"Same review as Season six, except this short episode was free. If it had not been free, it would not have been worth it."
5,Best Show Ever!!,"i currently own season 1-5. I'm getting season 6 as a gift, at first when rescue me came out, to be honest i wasn't a fan.But then i watched a episode and became instantly hooked on the show. I'm a firemen and when i watch the show, its quite an honor to be part of the brotherhood. I know this is a tv show and the actors aren't real firemen.I'm quite honored to be part of rescue me, because those actors were like brothers and still are my brothers.I'm extremely sad that rescue me is over, but it had pretty good run and the memory's are priceless and never forgotten. Thank You Rescue me for giving me the best 6 years of my life and i will be continuing to watch rescue me episodes and i will never get sick of rescue me. God Bless America!!"
5,Great TV Series,"I would watch this show from time to time with no consistency. Each time I saw it I like it but failed to follow up and watch more. After reading several reviews from fans of the show, I decided to purchase the series. OMG! What a great investment. I loved it and still do. Well developed characters that you can easily feel as though you ""know"" them. Sad to hear it will end in 2011, but I understand. It has had a good run. LOVE IT."
2,Oh joy. More soap opera garbage.,"I can sum this review up quite quickly I feel.Does anyone remember this show when it first came on and was about firefighters? I enjoyed that...enjoyed seeing the things they deal with, and I think the show did it quite well. This show since then (in my opinion) has devolved into something akin to daytime TV. Oh look another episode about Tommy's drinking. Followed by...another episode about Tommy's drinking. I wonder whats on next week? ANOTHER EPISODE about...well you see the trend.I guess if I want to see shows about Police/Fire/EMS I will have to stick to a series like ""Flashpoint"" or ""Trauma"".Pity really. I used to love this show."
3,Caution: Violent Torture Scene Between Tommy and His Daughter,"There are a lot of viewers, when they see the scene towards the end of this episode, where Tommy virtually tortures his daughter physically for her alcoholism, who may swear off this show after this episode. Beyond the alcoholism, this is such a low life style of living embraced by Tommy and his cohorts that I have to ask myself how much more I wish to know about these fire people. I truly hope this is not a true cross section of fire fighters in America. They certainly do not lack for bravery but they have just about every other character flaw one can imagine as depicted by this show."
3,Good Quality But Restricted to Viewing on Monitor,"The quality was good but I had hoped to transfer the downloaded files to a flash drive so that I could enjoy them on my big screen TV. You may only stream them on a mac. You may both stream AND download a copy on a PC(with additional software installed). The files are encrypted so when I put them on a flash drive and connected it to my HDTV, the episodes played scrambled and were not viewable."
1,Oooohhhhh... I get it. You're a drunk.,I loved this show for a couple of years. After the first few seasons though I realized that it's the same crap over and over.
4,Great show..,I watched most of series on Netflix...but i got these on Amazon's video account...great deals and they are there fast...
1,"Its a ""leaker""!","The digital control is awesome however, getting water all over your pants when the Iron (starts up, user adds water, change temp settings) makes me wish I didn't drop and break my Rowenta. If B&D; had focused on the mechanical design for this Iron it could have been the perfect Iron.More power would be nice (ie 1700 watts) along with leak protection. Another use full feature would be two button input (+-). The other feature I like about the irons digital control is that it tells you when it's at the right temperature. However, all aside the Iron's first primary mission is to produce steam not dispense water. That why I rate this Iron a 1."
3,Quality NOT so hot.,I was looking for a nice chair for my daughter. Went through all those cheap elmo chair that flip easy and hated them. Saw this one online liked it because of the colors(Girl)but the quality is not so great. Best bet is the Osh Kosh Chair (All blue) Quality is much better and same price...
1,Disappointed,"While this chair is cute, the workmanship and quality are terrible. The material is very thin and stretched crooked in places. There is barely any padding-no padding at all on the sides or back-just material that is stretched too tight where a piece of wood can be felt. This can be very easily ripped, leaving a hole that's non repairable. In the back, the material is stapled, of all things. On the bottom, the edges of contrasting material is sticking out where it wasn't cut even. I would not recommend this chair at all. And Babies R Us should be embarrassed to sell it. Very poor quality for the price tag. And unsafe because of the workmanship-visible staples and wood poking against thin material. We have two Osh Kosh brand chairs, and there is no comparison at all. Too bad they don't sell one for girls-I never would have bought this one, only to have to return it."
5,"Sharp Mind, Sharp Pen","Beth Kalikoff is a writer of unusual precision and insight. One should do whatever it takes to procure this book-- it is a diamond in the rough (though probably harder to find than the needle in the haystack). Currently, Kalikoff works as the Director of the University of Washington, Tacoma's Writing Center where students have the distinct privilege of working directly with this gifted teacher and gracious writer."
1,This Soundtrack Ain't Nothin'!,Forget this lame soundtrack! I want New York Undercover on DVD and I WANT IT NOW!
1,Mac Buier Beware,I bought this thinking it counld give my house wi-fi. And it dosen't the CD didnt even work. If you want wi-fi you need a wireless router. This is a Pre-N Router
3,checkbook cover,"Well, I really appreciate being able to have access to amazon to purchase this product. I went to many stores to purchase a quality checkbook cover and without any luck, wasn't able to find one. I was only able to locate women's wallets. So needless to say this was so easy to order and a fantastic gift for my husband. Thank you"
5,This is the one Biber.,"Absolutely intoxicating: I listened to many of the Manze recordings of baroque violin as well as other highly rated performances in this genre but find myself coming back again and again to this CD. If you can only buy one Biber, this is the one!"
5,YOU'VE GOTTA COP THIS!!!,"I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS CD WAS NOT BLOWN UP, WHEN IT WAS RELEASED A FEW YEARS AGO. HE IS TRUELY ONE IN A MILLION. I LISTEN TO HIS CD EVERYDAY, ON MY WAY TO SCHOOL,DURING SCHOOL, AND EVEN AFTER.RASAAN PATTERSON'S BEATS ARE HOT!!!HE TRUELY HAS TALENT AND A VERY UNIQUE VOICE.EVERY SONG THAT HE HAS ON IS DEBUT ALBUM IS A WINNER. HIS MUSIC SETS A MOOD FOR WHEREVER YOU GO.I AM BEGGING RASAAN PATTERSON TO GET BACK INTO THAT STUDIO AND MAKE MORE MUSIC.I SAY THIS BECAUSE HE HAD CHANGED MY LIFE...HE HAS INSPIRED ME AND I HOPE HE CONTINUES MAKING MUSIC.GOD BLESS...."
2,But...,"Well produced and executed, obviously talented boy, but the influences of Prince are all over that I could barely listen to this album (I like Prince and that is the problem).This is neither very original nor too inspiring."
5,YUHUUUUUU......,"RAhsan'S VOCAL'S FANTASTIC... So free....especially the improvisation in the song ""Where You Are"".. Too bad I lost my album and now I can't find any of it again in any store in my town.... But I'l never give up to try to find out in other cities in my country...cause i don't have a credit card YET to buy it through AMAZON"
4,A refreshing mix of talent and technology!,"I received this CD as a gift from my girlfriend in October 1997, and was immediately hooked by the song ""Ain't No Way"". As a talent, Rahsann Patterson is indeed like no one else on the R&B music scene today. He intelligently mixes cutting-edge technolgy with old-school harmonies and heart-felt lyrics--with no rap! Songs like ""Come Over"" and ""Stay"" are what I like to call ""one-listen-stick-witchas"". And the way ""Ain't No Way"" sort of ""sneaks"" up on you is quite original in its composition. For a debut CD, this one's definitely a must-have."
5,Fantastic product,"This was a great buy. I play congas, and was getting tired of using adhesive tape sticking to my fingers and anything else available. This tape does not use a sticky adhesive material. It is very easy to apply, and extremly comfortable."
4,Good Tape,"As the other reviewer said, this tape doesn't use an adhesive substance or anything, it is just a rubbery mesh that only sticks to itself. Therefore, it doesn't stick to drumsticks all that well. Even if you wrap it really tight on the stick, it will still slide up and down the stick a little as you play. It's not that big a deal, it just may get annoying after a while. Other than the sliding, this tape is great. It gives a really good grip. Also, since the tape doesn't use an adhesive, it is reusable, though it may wear down after long use. The roll it comes with is also a great value. It seems there's enough tape to cover at least 20 sticks.Overall a great value, if you don't mind a little sliding."
2,Not very durable,"This is a good product...or so i thought...before i say anything, i only play Rockband drums, i am by no means a professional drummerwhen i got these, i put them on my drum sticks and they worked very well, i have problem of hitting a pad in the wrong way and the stick flies out of my hand. so they worked really well for a few hours, but after a while the fabric starts to fray and get loose around the stick. And then the fabric will rip entirely and the whole thing will fall apart wasting like a foot or two of the tape.at least it was cheap and i bought a few rolls, so i can just reapply it as it wears out, because it does help. but if it cant stand up to rockband drums, then i can imagine that it would work to well for a legit drummer."
2,Not very relevant,"First, I'd like to say that I have nothing against Mr. Ali (AH), and a lot of his other books are very good and definitely worth reading both from a spiritual and psychological standpoint. I think it's a shame that he doesn't publish under a more psychology-oriented name.That said, I didn't find a whole lot of value in this book. It wasn't very relevant to his overall theory, it doesn't provide anything practical that I can discern, and it's mostly confusing woo. I haven't read any of his ""intro to the diamond approach"" books, so I can't say anything one way or the other about them, but they would probably be a better starting point than this."
5,The very best enneagram book for self-unfoldment,"Touching, warm, gentle and precise. Almaas explains how we get fixated on certain enneatypes, and also points the way out of fixations. Reaching far deeper than the 'standard' personality approaches to the enneagram, this book really opens the gates to those who are seriously pursuing the Work of self-liberation."
5,Best live album ever,"I used to listen to the LP from my parents when I was a kid. Now I have the double CD and I love it so much... it is so great. I had the good fortune of seeing Belafonte twice live in concert (in 1989 and 1998) and he is just one of the best ""entertainers"" in the world. Get this double disc set NOW ! (not a Pink Floyd, but a Tina Turner fan !)"
5,Better than I hoped for!!!,I had been looking for Balafonte at Carnegie Hall for quite some time. When I found it was available I was delighted and placed my order immediately. Although the product was shipped from over seas it was delivered within 10 days and arrived in excellent condition. I would certainly use this resource again.
4,"Whaddaya Mean, This Guy Ain't From Texas?","I once read a review by Robert Christgau which made fun of ""Li'l Wallet Picture"" from this CD. For one brief moment, I knew what it felt like to be the Unabomber. [Caution: Views expressed, etc.] What business has Rolling Stone of publishing suchclaptrap? True, Buckner's voice is an acquired taste. When he tries to push out the emotion he kinda sounds like he's, uh--using the facility. But getting past that, here are some of the most heartfelt, achy-breaky songs to ever come out of ... well, I would have said Texas but then I learned he was from California. Texas is his spiritual home at least. These songs are about heartbreak, memory, leavin', and drivin'. Lots of drivin'. Drivin' down misty highways at 4 a.m., past dead-man's curves, drivin' thru the backroads of lost love. If that ain't Texas, it oughta be. And if you don't git it--then what the heck you readin' this for?"
4,My 2 Boxers Love it,"My very sweet but destructive boxers have not destroyed this toy after almost a year. It's a bit dirty, but still intact. It is long enough so each dog can have an end and tug away! I will say - I never noticed the spearmint flavor/scent. But as long as my dogs are happy, I could care less about that detail!"
5,Built tough enough for my dog,"I have an 80 pound dog that will pull on this rope as long as you can hold it. She's tore through a few of these throughout her life, but we can get 2-3 years out of these before its unrecognizable. I've been through some cheaper made ropes and she can destroy them in hours.She loves it so I got to keep one in the house, with these I'm buying them less often."
2,A fool & his money,"soon parted.... very disapointed, bad design, not for the gym which is what I bought them for.. sound is OK, not wonderful... wish I would have read these reviews before I spent the $100."
3,"Sound OK ..But, not worth the money, and poor engineering","I am in Australia, and these little speakers retail for US $ 115.00 here.Sound quality is OK for the size of the speakers, but, maybe not the price.Now, the bad part..These in-ear headphone are supposed to stay in..That's the selling point. I am using the largest tips ( L ) with them, and they still fall out. Luckily, I have been careful, and have been able to find the tip after it has fallen off. I have purchased a spare set of tips for the headphones, and at US$ 13.00 a set , thats too expensive. I wonder if BOSE will trade in my un-used spare sets that come with the package. I will accept US $ 9.00 a pair for them !BOSE should produce some larger size tips and supply them FREE to existing customers who have a problem with the headphones coming out of your ear. Maybe super glue will be the answer to the problem."
2,Average earbuds,"I bought these good looking earbuds with the idea that the Bose name and $100 price tag would equal a stellar pair of earbuds.Unfortunately, they disappoint.As another poster mentioned, THESE ARE USELESS FOR JOGGING OR ANY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. Even on an elliptical treadmill with my head relatively motionless they fall out within a minute-- and I've used all included mold sizes.These earbuds are OK if you aren't going to use them while running, exercising, or moving much. But for the price, I expected a pair that do not fall out.These are being returned tomorrow."
3,These are decent headphones,"I have owned these head phones for about a year now I have the updated ones with the black and white cords these headphones have rich quality sounds to them as far as isolation goes , I feel as though they do block out a lot of noise. But if you are jumping around alot like doing exercise I think it still would be easy for you to lose you ear pieces that come with the buds.If you are a person who likes lots of bass these headphones are not for you. These plugs do not have the Bass. But other than that they are nice I do hear the highs and lows very clearly.I paid about 45 dollars for thes headphones on Amazon from a market seller. So I think I got my money worth. But I would not recommend anyone to pay a arm and a leg for these headphones. I really think the head phones are a little over rated as far as price goes. But what can you say they are BOSE."
2,Poorly constructed. Very UN-BOSE like.,The wire came apart at the part that connects to the player with only normal use and then soon therafter stopped working completely as wires became frayed. Sound very decent but for $95 ear buds they did not last very long. Very dissappointed in this BOSE product.
2,worst money i spent in a while,"I bought this item overseas while I was deployed expecting good things considering it was Bose, which is normally a good brand...however, the sound was alright but not the greatest and the earphones don't stay in your ears at all, not something I would recommend for anyone."
1,Bose - Junk in my ear,Ear pcs fell apart after 20 min of use. Sound nothing to write home about.Returned product for full refund.
1,Very Poor Product,"My pair worked fine for about two months, and then the sound started to routinely cut out when plugged into my iPod or laptop. I have no explanation for this, as I have taken very good care of them since I got them last Christmas. Ever since, I have had to twist the jack while in the iPod or laptop in order to get the right sound. Otherwise, voices and bass are replaced with strange indescribable underwater noises. I'm guessing there is a short at the base of the wire at the jack connection.Before this occurred, I lost the gel-coverings (none of which fit correctly) twice, and have worn them bare ever since, which hurts after about 30 minutes.I might add that the sound was terrific for two months."
2,Great sound but too many bugs,"Despite superb audio quality, I would not recommend the Bose in-ear headphone to anyone who exercises and has an active lifestyle. First, the cord that Bose has chosen to use with this headphone is plastic-coated and fairly stiff, a significant departure from the supple cords used on other Bose headphones. As a result, the cord for the in-ear headphone tends to tangle and kink easily. Second, the cord is about six inches shorter the similar headphone cords. That presents a real problem if you are working out in a gym and use the Bose in-ear with your iPod or MP3 player. Third, the soft plastic earpieces -- Bose provides three pairs - small, medium and large -- tend to fall off a little too easily. A snap-over ridge doesn't do a very good job of holding the earpieces to the headphone unit. Consequently, they come off, and Bose charges for replacements. Bottomline is ... great sound but too many aggravating little problems associated with this headphone."
1,Useless outside,"The reason to not buy these headphones is that you can't hear anything if there's more than a slight breeze or any sound above a whisper. I rode my bike with these and could barely hear my iPod and then took the subway and I may as well have not had any music on. There's no reason to buy these: Bose's larger Triport headphones are good if you're not leaving the house, and if you are, well, you need another pair of headphones 'cause these are worthless. VERY disappointed."
1,NO THANKS...,Thank goodness for the local department store's return policy. After using these earbuds for just one day I returned them. I don't think I even have to mention what was wrong with them...there are plenty other reviews that do that.One thing that I will mention is the earphone jack's plastic housing unit. What a horrible bulky design. Was it really necassary for Bose to create such an annoying feature just so they could fit their brand name on it?These went back to the store within 24 hours and I have since moved on to the V-Moda line of earphones.
1,Wish I had read the reviews...,"I was excited when I saw this Bose product and asked my boyfriend for it as a Christmas gift. Now I feel terrible, because they were so expensive and I know he wasted his money. Everything that others have said is true: They do not stay in the ear, the sound is faint, they don't close out sound, there are annoying cracks in the sound, and the plastic covers fall out constantly, even when I've glued them on. I've lost one right now, and am furious at the thought of spending more money to replace it. It is shocking what a bad product this is."
1,Crazy Overpriced Junk,"Brand freaks buy Bose. I bought these at a Bose ""outlet"" store (like you're ever going to save money there.) for $99.00 and within two days lost the crappy little silicone earbud thing. They do NOT stay in much better than anything else and most critically they do not sound any better than cheap headphones. As a matter of fact, they allow in a lot more background noise. I am furious with myself for spending a hundred bucks on these and I am avowed to never give Bose another red cent of mine ever again. Overpriced junk the lot of it."
1,Waste of money,"I agree with everyone that talks about the stupid things falling off. I am continually looking for the little plastic sleeve and they constantly fall out of my ear. Maybe they are designed for some music listener's ear in the middle of Nebraska. That one person in millions who's ear fits these things perfectly. Alas, I am apparently not that person so for me they suck :-)Sound is not bad but nothing special and if you don't plan on moving or are in a coma i think these will work fine for you"
1,Never Delivered,"There is no way I can review the product, it was never delivered!!!! I am attempting to get a full refund and collect for frustration, loss of time, and damages.Thank you"
4,Excelent Sound Quality - Easy to loose Earbuds,"The sound quality is amazing, is another experience use the iPod with the Bose in-ear headphones. I loose two earbuds on the first month, but bose solds the replacements at $5."
1,##@** !!!,"1 star for sounding great...WHEN they stayed in my ear. They fall out just from normal movement, not to mention when jogging. Absolutely wothless, unless you are seated, relaxing, and listening to the music."
3,Ill-fitting but incomparable sound,"The sound is incredibly great, full and rich. Deep bass and detail. Unfortunately, they do NOT stay put in my ears even with their smallest silicone earpieces which extend too far out. A pricey mistake..."
1,Destroys everything I like about music,"These earbuds have one redeeming value... They're not painful to wear. I have fairly sensitive ears, so i can't wear IEM's unless they're custom, and on-ear headphones are just plain painful. These are, so far, the only pair of earbuds that aren't painful to wear, so at least they're portable.On to the reason they're rated so low...They kill the sound. These earbuds have a very repressed high end... and a repressed low end... and an overbearing low-mid, and a halfway decent mid-range sound... overall they sound dead and unresponsive... I've listened to comfortable headphones that sound twice as good as these for a third of the price (I paid USD100 for mine when i got them)also, over time, the plastic/rubber around the plug starts to break down, and i've wrapped the plug with electrical tape to keep it on... a fairly known problem, if i remember correctly"
4,Excellent Sound but the Buds Need Some Work,"I think that the sound generated by these little headphones is awesome (particularly the bass). I docked them a star for the following reasons, though:1. I have difficulty keeping these from falling out. I have friends who have them who say they don't have problems with this, so maybe my ears are just shaped funny.2. The little ear pieces fall off way too easily. I had my phones for less than a month before having to order a new set of ear pieces from Bose ($5.00). You have to be extra careful with these."
1,I wish I would have read the Amazon reviews.,"This was a [...] dollar rip off. First of all, note the covers on the earbuds. Take a good long look at them: because they will be gone. They do not stay attached: when you take the buds OUT of your ear, and when you set them down. Bose was ""generous"" enough to provide 1 (one) extra pair. When they are gone, its like putting a stick in your ear. Painful.If you've got a small ear canal, your gonna have to tape the earbuds to make them stay. Inconvenient.After all of that work, the quality is nothing spectacular. I noticed no significant difference between these and IPOD's factory earbuds.I cannot believe I was fooled into believing Bose wouldnt put their reputation online by selling crap. Folks, BOSE earbuds = CRAP. Save your money. Hopefully, Bose will see these reviews and act rationally by selling them for what they are worth: about 20 bucks and nothing more."
2,Have had two pairs and both died,"We bought the first set about 18 months ago. Sound quality was very good but the older black cord was junk. It started coming apart after 3 months and now the iPod pauses constantly thinking the cord has been pulled from it. We bought the second set about 15 months ago and even though I thought the newer white/black cord was a better structural design, they are now unusable. As stated in another review, you physically have to hold the connector into the iPod for it to work. So much for that and so much for thinking Bose has a durable product with this. Sound quality good in both cord models, durability poor."
2,Bose in ear phones,"They do not fit properly nor are they comfortable, even with the smallest rubber ceshion. I am disappointed."
2,Disappointed,I just bought this earphone today and I was so disappointed. I could not tell the difference from my old earphone which cost $10. I tried classical music and also pop music both are not making big difference. I do not recommend this earphone.
1,They do not stay in your ears!,"If you ever want to use these for anything other than sitting completely still, do NOT purchase them. Not only can I not jog in them without them falling out, but I also cannot walk or even turn my head too quickly. I have tried all of the different sizes and none of them work. My $10 headphones that I bought 5 years ago stay in my ears better."
3,"Good sound, not very durable","I'll be the first to admit I'm tough on headphones. I use them at the gym and on a long commute, where I'm frequently juggling several items and trying to grab the handrail in the subway, causing my iPod and headphones to go flying. However, these very headphones were heavily advertised on the subway, so I assumed they'd be up to the job. The first problem, as others have mentioned, are the silicone protectors, which fall off if you breathe on them. The product ships with an extra pair, but I went through both in under two weeks and have been using them ""bare"" ever since. The second problem is the flimsiness of the earpiece. The plastic disks on one side have separated, exposing the wires and killing the sound in the left ear. Overall, I don't think these are a good buy for the price."
4,"Great sound, design needs improvement","I used these for over a year before I lost them and I really enjoyed the sound quality that came from such small phones. The base was rich, the treble was vibrant, not piercing or hollow. Since they aren't sound isolating or noise canceling, these ear phones aren't supposed to cut out the background noise and they do not.The rubber tips are very comfortable, but there was nothing to keep the earphones from falling out or not fitting snugly. Also, the tips have a tendency to fall of with very little provocation because they are barely held on by a little plastic ridge. That part needs improvement.All-in-all, I would buy these again but I would super-glue my preferred tips into place pretty much first thing out of the box."
2,Does not stay in ear,"Sound is very good ,but they fall out constantly if you are active .I tried all three sizes but they will not stay in my ear ,even while doing yard work .Very disappointed and a hundred dollars lighter."
1,A surprisingly inferior product from Bose,"I've always been a fan of Bose's innovative sound technologies, so it was with eager anticipation that I placed my order for this new product late last year. What a disappointment! The sound quality is OK at best, and the fit of the earphones terrible. Don't try to workout with these phones in place--even walking can easily dislodge the buds from your ears. And the silicone tips often fall off when you remove the phones from your pocket. Too many times I've retraced my steps at work, at home, or in the gym looking for one of these hard-to-see tips, and this morning I watched as one tumbled from from my pocket as I removed my iPod, bounced a couple of times on the subway platform, and dropped onto the tracks. I'm going back to Etymotic."
2,Definitely don't live up to the hype,"I am still on a futile search to find earbuds that are actually comfortable AND sound good.These aren't that much more comfortable than the stock Ipod phones, but more importantly, they really don't sound that great. I did a back-and-forth comparison to my ugly but comfortable $30 Sony MDR-A30s that I've been using for years (but they're the over-the-head type which aren't comfortable if you have to wear a hat), and unfortunately the Bose couldn't hold a candle to them. My Sonys sounded much crisper and clearer, and LOUDER. As other reviewers have mentioned, you have to turn the volume almost all the way up on your MP3 player to get loudness equivalent to about 2/3 volume or less with other headphones. Also, I found the bass to be overwhelming no matter what my EQ was set to.What a huge disappointment after all the hype and ""research."" I hope Bose goes back to the drawing board. In the meantime, I'll be going back to the Bose store and returning these."
4,Excellent sound quality but earbuds may slip off,I am using these headphones from last one month and i am totally satisfied with the sound quality. sometimes earbuds may fall off if u r Jogging.
2,Do not stay in ear well and you will probably lose plastic bud,"The sound is fine, not sure if its $100 fine but I don't have any complaints about the sound.However, these do not stay in my ear well at all and are not very comfortable to boot. I have tried the different size plastic buds and still cannot find a good fit for one of my ears.On top of that, the plastic buds do fall off and I have already lost one. It will only be a matter of time before I lose them all.Not worth the $$$."
2,"Cool idea, poor execution","I got these headphones at half off when I was working a second job at the Geek Squad in Best Buy. I normally love Bose electronics, but even at my discounted employee rate, I can't recommend these to anyone. I've lost all the plastic ear buds except for the large ones which don't fit my ears. They fall off at least 3-4 times a day. I like the idea of multiple ear sizing, as normal earbuds don't usually fit me, and when I had the right size the sound was fine and I finally had earbuds that didn't hurt or fall out of my ears. But with the loss of my last fitting earbud, and after seeing that you can't buy replacement ones at the Bose website, I feel ripped off and would never buy them again."
1,Major disappointment - NO stars,"Considering the price and the Bose name, I expected a major improvement in sound and comfort with these buds. I received them as a xmas present and don't have a receipt. The package was impossible to open without destroying, so I threw it away. Otherwise I would have returned these immediately. The sound isn't significantly better than the pods that come with the iPod, and I agree with other reviewers in terms of the bad fit and poor ergonomics. I was considering getting the Bose speakers for my iPod until I tried these. Now I don't think much of the Bose name."
2,great sound if you're home,"Sound is terrific but only in the quiet of your home. Any, and I mean any outside noise and forget it, even at high volume you can't hear the music. Forget about using them on a jet, all you hear is the engine. Plus the ear pieces are constantly falling off no matter what size, any ear bud that goes into the ear canal work much much better to isolate outside noises. Too bad, in the quiet of your room the sound is great, but that's about it."
2,Wish the blumin' ear buds would stay on!,"Ok... I am a moderate fan of bose and was excited to see a friend had bought these and on his recommendation, I bought a pair. Then the tide changed:On the day mine arrives, my friend says the ear buds keep falling off. Not good. Oh well, maybe mine will be fine but having looked around on line, there seems to be a lot of buds for sale. Again, not a good sign.When mine arrived, it took me a while to choose the correct bud for my ears. After about 3 weeks, my first ear bud popped off (while my friends' buds now pop off all the time).I nearly lost a bud the other day on a flight. Luckily I found it. A potentially costly and annoying mistake.As for sound, pretty good. Both my friend and I have experienced a few ""popping"" sounds from them.Would I buy them for someone I liked... No. Bose, you need to test these products a little more thoroughly. Naughty naughty."
3,A good read...but not the best.,"I finished this book in two weeks, which is a far cry from my usual No-doz induced, all-night read-a-thon. At times, the book would move at lightning speed, at other times it was slower than molasses. Why did the author feel the need to give the geography of the city to the readers? Was that supposed to give us insight on why Mr. Rogers was a serial killer? Someone pass me a pillow, I'm going to bed. Nighty-night."
5,"Teacher for twenty years, and I have seen many like him.",I was facinated with the main character. I have seen many high school boys like him. Sad.
5,Happy to be the first,"I am a little surprised that no one has reviewed this CD. It contains my favorite rendition of the Tchaikovsky concerto. The Brahms is also excellent, although I think Oistrakh's version with Szell is probably the best I've heard. I'd be interested in other informed views."
3,Decent,"This book covers the traditional tort material very well. However, it does not do as good of a job covering products liability and strict liability. If you're in a bind, this book would probably help you salvage a decent grade, but I would not rely on it if you're going for the A."
5,Initially Puzzled But Ultimately Pleased,"I was expecting a book about small pastries (I LOVE pastries!), with perhaps lots of lush, full-color photos of tasty raspberry-jam-filled confections (I LOVE raspberry jam!). But, to my initial disappointment, I instead found a book explaining some kind of legal rigmarole about suing people for damaging persons or property. Despite its dry, abstract subject matter, this book actually turned out to be an extremely gripping read. (I devoured it all in one sitting, staying up all night because I just had to know how it ended.) Even if you're only interested in opening your own little patisserie and spreading joy to people through your talent with filo dough, I highly recommend this book anyway: After all, you never know when a customer might slip and fall in your shop."
3,Not Worth the Money,"Generally, the Examples and Explanations series are thorough and helpful. However, this particular book falls short. There are 7 intentional torts; yet, this book only covers assault and battery. Additionally, only 2 privileges are covered -- self-defense and consent. I didn't bother looking at how the book covered negligence. Unless your Torts I class provides a survey of the material, especially the intentional torts, do NOT buy this book if you want extensive treatment of torts concepts."
1,AVOID THIS TREATISE,"I strongly recommend against buying this book. A lot of the material covered in a first year Torts class is not covered in this book; a few examples are false imprisonment, defamation, and invasion of privacy. In addition, this book has MISTAKES in it regarding the law; one example is it does not specify the standard of care owed by a physician in a medical malpractice case correctly. Of course it does not even have a separate section dealing with duty owed by professionals...Instead of this book, I would strongly recommend Understanding Torts by Diamond (Lexis) or the Law of Torts by Dobbs (West)."
4,"Very good, but could use improvement","This book does a very good job of covering intentional torts and the law of negligence. The section in the newest edition on exam writing is also very good. It could, however, include a chapter or two on products liability and other torts typically covered in first-year torts i.e. defamation, misrepresentation etc. I recommend, but not as highly as I'd recommend Glannon on Civil Procedure."
2,Too basic to be helpful,This book is too basic and only covers a small part of the first-year Torts course. Don't rely on this to help much for the exam! I would recommend finding something with more detail on Negligence and Products Liability.
3,"Parents liked it, kids not so much","We thought this was a well-written game, fun but educational. But our kids just didn't get into it at all. They much preferred the Jump Start series instead. If you were going to get this one, I'd start with this, THEN get Jump Start. Maybe then this would be more interesting to them for a while."
4,Nice learning game,"Fun learning game. My niece likes playing the game. She's putting to use the things she's learning in school and having fun at the same time. Some of the math problems can be a bit challenging for her. Overall she likes playing it and I like that she's learning from it too. No issues with loading or playing the game either, it's on XP."
5,My son loves it!,"My son loves this game. His approval means a lot, because he has practically every educational game for his skill level and can really compare. He is now asking me to buy him the 4th, 5th and 6th grade version of Clue Finders, so that when he is ready he could start playing them right away."
2,Few Math problems that can be solved by trial and error,"In this game the two characters travel down a trail that takes them to places where they have to solve ""ONE"" math problem. Therefore, children playing this game don't get much practice and do not learn anything. Even worse, you can solve this multple choice problem by trial and error and then proceed down the trail to the next math problem. My four year old that does not know any math is able to complete the game just by trying every answer at every math station. My two daughters do like this game, but it does not teach them any math. The Jump Start Math for Second Graders is actually much more challenging. There at every stage chidren have to solve many problems and sometimes they have little time to do this."
1,Be forewarned!,"Be Careful! The Learning Company Mac compatible Cluefinders 3rd Grade does NOT WORK on OSX. We even scrolled back to our 9.6 program from the dark ages and it doesn't work there, either. It's very out-dated. Too bad, as it came so highly recommended."
3,So-So Battery Charger,"This charger seems to work ok, but is not nearly as nice as the OEM version. Its main advantage is that it plugs directly into the wall without requiring a bulky cord and comes with a European adapter plug and car adapter. Unfortunately, the standard plug has plastic molded partially down the two prongs and they won't plug all the way into an outlet. This can cause it to fall out if you are not careful. Also, the battery is not held in position very securely and you can only count on it staying in place if you can plug the adapter in such that the battery hangs down and gravity helps."
3,Michael Flatley Returns,"It was just fair, I have 3 others that where made by Flatley and this was allbackround effect, it got to the point where you could not see them dancing. Feet of Flames & the first Lord of the Dance where simpler & better."
3,Return as Lord of the Dance,I was very dasappointed in this show. The music sounded like a kids music box for most of the show and grated on my nerves after awhile. I can't understand why he didn't include some of the thousands of great Irish musicians. The dancers were great but the outfits were just gawdy to say the least. Overall very disappointing or maybe just spoilt by their previous outstanding shows.
2,The original is much better,"Compared to the original Lord of the Dance video this one has background scenery on the stage that is very distracting. It is sometimes hard to see the actual performances. And there are very few close ups of the performers faces. And because of the years that have elapsed since the original video came out, Michael Flatley has lost quite a bit of that world class athleticism he used to have. Remember those 180 degree leg kicks he used to have? Sadly, they are gone. From now on I will only watch the original video. After all, it's one the best videos ever made; in my opinion."
2,Pretty much like the original...,"While I love Michael Flatley, I found that this DVD was almost identical to the original ""Lord of the Dance"".....It's entertaining, as was the original, but nothing really new...."
1,3D effects suck,"3D was bad. movie was pretty stupid. wasnt worth importing lol not at all. i judge movies pretty much ONLY on their 3D effects, after all this is a 3D bluray right? well two thumbs down."
5,Outstanding!!!,"I've always been a fan of Michael Flatley as a flute player but never had the opportunity to see him dance. I saw this movie in the theater in 3-D and it was astounding!! It was wonderful to watch this blu-ray and see such a superb performance again!! Superb!! I would recommend this to anybody who is a fan of dance, Irish music, theater, or all of the above."
4,Mike is back !,Saw Michael in London years ago doing both Riverdance and Lord of the Dance and was quite dismayed when he went quiet and disappeared off the scene....but now the boy is back ! I've seen every incarnation of LOTD and found this one to be more glitzy. Was a tad disappointed to see a couple of sequences deleted from the show BUT it was good to see Michael still keeping his hand (feet) in !!
2,Poorly Filmed,I never finished watching the whole video because It was so poorly filmed that I finally shut if off . You felt like you were viewing it from the very last seat in the balcony. It was very disappointing .
3,Too much Michael,"I enjoyed the story line of the performance but there were whole lot of dancers I would have liked to see more of. Also, I would have liked to see some of the performance a little closer up - some of it was too far away. I wish I could have rented it and watched it because I probably wouldn't have bought it."
1,Colic tablets are horrible,These tablets did not help my son's colic at all. It only made it worst. I stopped using this product after a week. My son is 4 months.
2,Picture is deceiving,"Bought this costume for my newborn who will be 1 month by halloween. Maunfacturers age say 1 month, but no way she could fit into this. Like the previous post, I think it is stated wrong and you will be sent a toddler's 1-2."
3,beware of size,"Be careful. The picture shows an infant dressed in this costume and manufacturers size says 1 month. However, this is a TODDLER size costume. Cute costume, but there is no way it will fit my 10 lb infant"
5,Couldn't put it down...,"Ignore the first reviewer of this book, the reader obviously didn't read the first chapter... The book starts with Wild Bill's death on the very first page, during Day 12 and then the story reverts back to Day 1 in the next chapter to start the whole plot from then on. It was a gripping read, believable and fascinating. Am now on a quest for more Bill Buchanan books."
4,Technology takes its freedom a little too far.,"I had to read Virus for a technology unit in 8th grade. At first I thought I would not like it because the topic itself sounded boring, but when I was done my opinion was forever changed. The idea of a virus practically becoming a self-sufficient being was amazing in itself, but the idea of that virus completely taking over is incredible."
4,"Good, keeps your attention, but somethings aren't explained","I read this book a while ago, and I remember staying with it till the end. Right off the start, for those of you who are not very techie people, you will be confused like mad. A little less technological jargon will be a lot better. Also, somethings aren't really explained. Like how that guy who was supposed to fly up to the station to rescue them died. One page reads that he goes off on the mission, and the other will say that he is not going or something. I was really confused by that. Some detail, maybe a few more pages to detail his death, like how the laser beams blew up his craft would be great. Deric"
2,"An interesting premise, flawed by cliches.","If you are thinking about writing a book, buy this one and read it. Keep it on your desk for reference material. If you're looking for a literary cliche, it's in here somewhere. Short sighted politicians. Cold blooded killiers for hire. Fanatics. Brilliant, tough and honest commanders. Repeated endlessly.The idea is interesting if not necessarily believeable - an artifically intelligent virus which can run on any platform from a desktop computer to a supercomputer, and take over an orbiting weapons control station. Ok, it's been done before but there's always room for another, well executed. This one isn't. Save your money"
2,cheap Junk,The material these bits are made out of is so fragile that the points break off and the bit becomes useless. I tried to remove some rounded screws out of some 2x4's with this product and instead of removing the screw these bit just damaged the screw head even more. I then attempted to remove a damage screw from speed sensor on a vehicle and the bit broken. I do not recommend this for heavy duty work.
2,Not impressed...,"I purchased these for the sole purpose of removing rusted screws out of a vintage camper,100's of them.I did get the majority out with the assorted bits I did have ,but as everyone all knows, there is always going to be problem ones,....thus, I purchased this kit with the hopes everthing would go smoothly.Well,these removers act more like a drill bit,than anything else.Never grabbed,just rounded out the screw head even more.Maybe good in some apps.,but not this."
5,Great tool,This is a great product that does exactly what it advertises. I now dare a screw to strip out just so I can use my new tool.
2,Did not work for me,"It is sturdy well designed but it did not work for me , flattened out the screw even more ."
4,Works well for stripped laptop screws,"It works! But make sure if you are trying to remove a stripped screw from a laptop that is holding a keyboard in place, that you apply back pressure behind the keyboard as you are pushing on the stripped screw. It's likely that the smallest (#0) further strips the screw but dont be discouraged. this serves to create a smooth surface so that the #1 and then the #2 can grip into the screw. I started with #0, then tried #1, then the #2 removed the screw. Thank goodness too because I was just about ready to throw the laptop across the room. This product works just make sure you use a handheld screwdriver (not a power driver) and have alot of patience."
5,Backed out a laptop case screw,Was able to use the No. 0 to get out a stripped laptop case screw. It worked just as promised.
1,Broke during initial use.,"I bought the Eazypower brand after reading the reviews on the Grabit. We have a 600 sq ft deck my husband and I thought this product would work on. Our goal was to unscrew all the screws and flip the boards. Based on what this product says I thought we could get all the screws out. We read the directions and followed them. Tips broke off on the first couple of tries. As this was our last option, we are paying to have the deck rebuilt. This product probably would work great on screws that haven't been outside in the elements for 10 years. Maybe the company has not tested them on every situation. Thank goodness Amazon.com has a great return policy. We returned the product the next day and got a full refund."
1,"Big Fans of ""B.E."" Disappointed","We've got all the DVDs and love the CDs, too, so had high expectations when ordering this book. We also ordered The Van Gogh ABCs one and love, love, love it! It was just this book that fell short. Not as many photos as we would like and many of the pictures are drawn when we would have preferred a photo of the ""real thing."" For instance, a quilt. For the best bang for your buck, find Roger Priddy's My Big Word Book, Over 1000 Essential First Word Pictures. Good quality photos of everything under the sun, HUGE variety.Also, my son is almost 32 months old so he already has a good basic vocabulary and most of the words and photos in this book are ""old hat"" to him. He read it once with moderate interest and hasn't asked for it again. Perhaps for a younger child?"
2,Too kitchy,"I agree with the negative reviewer--the acting is way too kitchy and the singing is cloying.Poppea is a serious work, and much better videos are available."
1,Never Again,"This was my first laptop and vow to never buy another Sony VAIO again. Like most others I had problems from early up. The clock stopped keeping the correct time & date and I would always have to reset it each time I turn on, the magically corrcted itself after about 4 months. The ""J"" refusesed to work after a while now it just sticks whenever it feels like till I hit backspace or esc to stop it. Finally it decides to shut down and give a dull orange screen. I'v learnt my lesson... it's good to have places like Amazon to read reviews on products (sorry I didn't read about this one before)."
1,Great - until it died,"This was a great machine until it died on us. We owned ours only one and half years when the system board (motherboard) died. Come to think of it, the internal wireless card stopped working after only one year. And to make matters worse, our only option was to send it to San Diego for repairs(per Sony). It wasn't worth it for us. Get the extended warranty."
1,"Beautiful, but troubled",I bought a Vaio laptop in June 2003 with a 1-yr warranty. I loved it. Product died in month 13 due to failed memory socket. Did a search on internet and found many users with similar story. I offer the advice to do your research before you buy a high priced item like the Vaio. I'm sorry I got carried away by the glitz and glamour of this beautiful but troublesome laptop.
2,Don't like this machine,"My husband bought me the Sony Vaio FS742W for Christmas. I have been so disappointed.Good Points: Great screen!! the picture quality is amazing!!Bad Points:There must be something wrong with the operating system. I am running Windows XP Home. From the time I opened the box, this computer has had trouble managing the updates. For instance, Java would like to download updates, but my operating system freezes everytime in mid installation.Also, I bought the Windows Fun Pack with the extra games and screen savers, etc. Won't install...soooo frustrating!! Any other game that I have bought I have had to uninstall and do a system restore...no fun!!I don't know if it is the computer design or the operating system, but this computer has been trouble since the beginning!!When I called customer service, their only advice was for me to reinstall the operating system. HMMMM...thanks for the help..NOT!"
2,98 days - it died,"Bought one on the advise of a sales person. Nice screen. Excellent speed. Lightwight, and battery lasts about 2 hours.However, audio is extreamly low. Screen is not as bright as I would like it to be.Yesterday It took a 3 foot tumble while shut off. I turned it on and it ran great..Then I went to work and returned home and it ran great. Then after sitting there over night, I turned it on this morning and got ""operating system not found"".Sure glad I bought a service agreement. On the other hand, I needed this for a chrismas vacation, and now don't have a laptop. Next time, Im going with a HP Pavalon.The viao case, while plastic and light weight, doesn't allow for much bouncing, I suppose."
2,The worst rain boots I have ever bought,I bought these boots because they were very cute but they started to fall apart after a few wearings. It had never happened before with my daughter's boots by other brands.
1,They crack,I have three daughters and have purchased many rain boots. Have had two pairs of this particular brand and both pairs cracked along the seems.
1,ordered twice and both times POOR quality!!,"I ordered these last year and I was surprised at what a mess these boots were! Sent them back thinking that maybe this was an exception. Nope, second pair was just as bad. I'll try and include some pictures, but let's just say they both looked like if you were to make these yourself and you put the kitty face and tail appliques on but then they didn't go on right, stuck to themselves, folded over in some places, and then you put a sealant over the boot but didn't bother to remove any of the dark fuzz or lint, maybe added some here and there for kicks, then you would have the same boots that i received in the mail. One time, maybe i could see happening, but twice? Hopefully I'm the exception because they are really cute boots. Good luck!"
2,Do not last!,I purchased these rain boots last year and they did not last at all- My daughter wore them 4 times (the most) and the plastic ripped all over the boot. Do not recommend.
3,Cute boot,"works just fine to keep their feet dry if just walking but not great for puddle jumping because takes quite some time for the inner boot to dry out from water getting inside boot. Lining is not holding up, already peeling off when we received package. Daughter loves her boots though, even wears in house"
4,Perfect Gift,"I bought these as a birthday gift for the girl I babysit and she loved them. My only complaint is that when they arrived there was some dirt on the sides of the boots, as if they weren't new. Other than that, great job."
4,Super cute and the handles are great,Super cute and the handles are great for my 5 year old to help pull them on over her snow pants. We live in Kansas and do get a bit of snow and she loves to go outside and stomp around. The only thing with these boots is they do run about a half size big--just from comparing my daughter's other shoes to the boots. I got her a 12 and maybe should have gone with an 11. At least she can wear them next year.
3,Cute and Sturdy,Cute and sturdy. However these are not for toddlers fat little feet! Seem to run narrow.
5,Rain Boots,"My daughter loves these rain boots and they are well made. Good value through Amazon, have seen them for much more."
5,Great Bay Area rap release!!!,"I picked up this album with a bit of hesitation as I had never heard of the three rappers in the group, Say-So, Fidel Castro and B-12. With great appearances and production and tracks like neva Look Back, Another Weekend and Passin' Us By this release should be picked up immediately and is definately a Bay Area classic that is highly slept on!!!"
4,Riderlife,4.5 stars for this nearly unheard of cd. The only reason I even have it is cause when I see my friend I burn all the cds he has that I dont and he had this one. VERY happy with the 22 cents it took to get this but if I heard this before I would still buy it in the store.
4,Does a goog job!,Shipping was quick. Product does exactly what the site say's it does. I unfortunately have a 10.5ft ceiling and did not measure it before purchasing it. But I made it fit and it works just fine. I gave it four stars because I have had to tighten it a few times already. Seems to loosen each time you take the bike off and put it back on.
4,Nifty,"Purchased this after my LBS told me I shouldn't keep my beloved in the basement because it was slowly rusting. Was able to put it together after only glancing at the instructions for less than a minute. It seems flimsy, however if you make sure everything is tightened and in its secure place like it should be, it will get the job done. It has been holding my Trek 7.3 above the couch in the living room for a few days now and It hasn't come crashing down yet."
1,It simply does not hold two bikes,"The SpareHand QUICK-SUPPORT is certainly named correctly. You will quickly find out that it DOES NOT hold two bikes. While manuficatured fairly well, it is impossible to ""HAND TIGHTEN"" the attachment bolt enough to hold even an aluminum bike. This was a complete waste of money. DO NOT BOTHER WITH IT. It is useless for two bikes. The images shown on the box and the website must be a fabrication. IT DOES NOT WORK AS ADVERTISED."
2,"OK, needs some caution","This OK for storing two bikes in a fairly quiet part of the house.It's built OK; not terribly stable or strong, but will do the trick cheaply.Had some issues trying to set it up, pinched fingers, bicycle rotating and the hooks dropping to ground (with the bicycle in top rack on it! the problem seems to be the square section of the top part, as opposed to the round shape of the twist lock). As a result, I have forbidden my child to touch or go anywhere near it or the bicycles it holds."
3,"no screws, but shaky","its cheap enough, but i was frightened for my life walking by this thing in my apartment.maybe better for a garage in the burbs where people dont value their existence as much.sold it on clist."
2,Missing box,It was not until a day after Christmas when my son notified me that this bike rack is shipped in 2 boxes and i only received one and now he is having to get involved with Amazon to get the second box.If you could please look into this matter and make certain he gets the second box would please me very much.Thank you and looking forward to resolving this error.Jim Watson
2,Sparehand - Bargain price/bargain results,I purchased one of these lower price units and also one of the Topeak pole units. The Topeak shows German engineering and much higher quality so it is easy to understand why it costs more. The adjustment of the Sparehand is crude but probably adquate if using in a garage with concrete floor and if your are not worried about your ceiling. The Sparehand will stay in the garage with only my spare bikes on it.
4,Great for saving space,"The swinging hooks make it a little difficult to hang the top bike with ease, but other than that the product works great.There were lots of complaints about this rack, but I just took the advice of some of the positive reviews right off the bat, and it works perfectly.-- Install it upside down (longer, thicker tube towards the top)-- Place a piece of rubber for grip in the cross bar clamp before tightening it to the post (piece of old tire tube, extra shim from other bike accessory, or even duct tape)"
4,Heavy on Huntsville,"This book is a valuable and interesting contribution to the early history of the United States space program. Probably due to the close involvement of the primary author with Wernher von Braun, there is an unexpectedly high proportion of the book devoted to those aspects of the space program related to Huntsville and the von Braun team's efforts there. This is not at all apparent from publicity releases about the book, or even from the cover of the book itself. While there is significant information contained in the book about the Mercury astronauts, its greater contribution is in its Huntsville-related content, which has not received such a degree of attention in most similar publications. Those who were involved in the program at Huntsville in those early days will find the book especially appealing."
2,An interesting chronicle of the inside story of the space race.,"Both Buckbee and Schirra do an equitable job of describing the details inside the race to the moon. The Apogee publication, however, suffers from poor editing and numerous errors. All in all, a creditable job by the authors, and an accurate insight into the American race for space, particularly the characterizations of von Braun and the M7."
3,"Fun ""Serenity"" money; not breath-taking, though","This play money modeled on the prop Alliance currency from the movie Serenity is fun and a must-own for any die-hard fan. However, the designs are simply meant to look realistic on camera, which means they aren't too impressive on close scrutiny. The pack contains 2 denominations, but they are identical except that one has a red background and the other blue. They are fun, but not too inspired, so don't buy them thinking they'll be as detailed as real money."
5,An awesome and authentic piece of the 'verse,"A pack of replica money as used is Serenity (shown in the bank heist and in the Maidenhead bar). This is officially licensed and really beautifully done. The box is a collector's item in itself, high-quality and glossy with great graphics and an ""introduction"" by Geoff Mandell (the graphic designer for Serenity) on the inside flap.The bills are high-quality and are an exact match for those used in the movie Serneity. I own two of the actual bills (one of each denomination) used in filming so I was able to compare them. Created from the original digital files, these isn't so much a replica as the actual item. This fake money is well worth laying down the real credits for."
2,Not up to usual QMX standards,"These bills are fine as a prop or prop replica, but as somebody else mentioned, they don't stand up to scrutiny. My biggest complaint is that they are identical front and back - these would be much more realistic with different graphics on front and back like most bills. Also the paper is thick and not very money-like. You get six 100 denomination bills and six 500 - wrapped in a scotch-taped bill band marked at 10000. All in all a nice souvenir of Firefly, but not really exciting or up to QMX standards, in my opinion."
3,Trays work,"All three trays work fine, but one of them was missing the locking top. I'll have to borrow form another tray when switching during use."
3,great,"the shipping was fast , this fit right into my projector with no promblems, if i need a nother carousel i would do the same witch i do with more pictures ."
3,jlc kodak review,"The projector is used and looks used, but seems to work o.k. According to the literature there was suppose to be a spare lamp but it wasn't there. Otherwise I am satisfied with the products."
1,a good [...].,"Your body gets oxygen by breathing not drinking. This is notan original quote, but we have a term for those trying to get oxygen from water. Drowning. Want to get yourblood oxygen levels up. take a deep breath. oxygen enrichedsports drinks, the same scam. This is a product for the [...] that is born every minute, and companies that sell this product arescammers."
5,Great excuse to have a party,"I invited some friends over to see this movie with me. It was very well done, informative, and exciting. My guests and I were spellbound by the scenery, as well as the in-depth information about Brazilian music. Hearing all the different kinds of music, and seeing the musicians and singers, was wonderful. There was a cohesiveness that increased our understanding of the culture, almost as if we were experiencing it first hand."
2,Beautiful To Look At but Flawed Storytelling,"The narrator spoils the story right off the bat by telling you nearly everything that's going to happen. It's simply a gorgeous looking movie with great performances, but any suspense of the story is removed. Hell, the title alone ""Ghost Wife"" tells you more than you should know. Imagine if you knew Bruce Willis was a ghost at the start of Sixth Sense? A nice diversion from American films, but not very compelling at all. Plus, this version of the DVD contains subtitles on top of other subtitles which is very confusing. There's English subtitles for dialogue, but many location or transitionary text in the original language is not accompanied with an English one. Just a sloppily thrown together DVD, that doesn't even have a menu. Just starts playing the movie as soon as you put it in."
5,Most comfortable Futon Mattress Ever!!!,This Futon Mattress is sooooo comfortable. The Innersprings are just incredibly comfortable and flexible for bending into the futon couch position. This was a great deal at that price! Buy with confidence
1,cracked hinges on 2 phones,"the hinge on this phone is faulty. any type of normal use can easily crack the hinge and of course the manufacturer blames it on usage. i have had wireless phones for 10 years and have never damaged one, two hinges in 3 months gave out on me with this horrible hinge design."
1,Horrible battery life..,Horrible battery life..Pls dont buy this phone. .Battery life sucks big time..I asked amazon for replacement with another phone within the warranty period. But they did not do that. There are many phone better than this. Sincere advice ..dont go for this.
3,More cons than pros,"Pros-3G (UMTS) supportCingular's music and video servicesexcellent call qualityintegrated Bluetoothexternal music controlsgorgeous internal displayspacious keypad.Cons-very short talk time battery life2-megapixel camera took below-average picturesproprietary port for headsets and headphones.no HSDPA support, Wi-Fi, or GPS."
1,Terrible Choice,"At first I believed that Nokia has the abality to make one of the greatest pnones out there, but this product has proved me wrong. Sure, at first it looks great, the interface and all that, but as time goes by, more and more defects start to show up. The biggest problem with this phone is the sim card luck can't securely keep the sim card in place so everytime when I try to start the phone it just kept giving me this error message"" start up failure, please contact retailer"", which drove me nuts!!Imaging everytime when you turn on the phone it's like a gambling, you might get it you might not. Secondly, this phone has the shortest battery life I have ever seem in my life. The battery was brand new and I had to charge every single day. The web indicates this battery suppose to have a stand by time of 8 hours, believe me, it was more like 4 hours, so once you start to talk, it dies out in about an hour. This is a terrible phone!"
2,Bad phone !,"This is by far the worst cell phone I ever had. I ordered it from Amazon in May of '07 I had to send it back becuase it used to over-heat after just 5 minutes of use, I also heard a very high pitch noise when in use. They sent me a replacement and I was stuck with it as it was past the 30 day return period. The issues were the same with the replacement phone. Last week the flip portion of the telephone cracked from normal use. I have never dropped the phone and I was always extra careful with it.I am not going to buy another Nokia phone, ever!! Very flimsy product and bad warranty through Nokia."
2,poor execution,Pro:- 3G- podcast download directly to phone- great screenCon:- Turning on the phone takes forever.- Random problem plague the phone.I expected better quality from Nokia. I rather have less feature and more solid performance.
2,Don't like it,"Yeah it has a lot of features, but like others have said its battery is crappy, but also the construction is cheap and the camera doesn't take good pictures. I bought it mainly because I was expecting a fairly decent camera and I'm disappointed.Don't drop it either, I dropped mine and there is a huge crack in the hinge, not something that can be repaired.Oh and this is the second one, the first one I had to return because it was malfunctioning. I wish they had given me something different in return."
3,it's all true,"i switched to at&t; for the iphone but purchased this phone instead. I wanted to like this phone and hoped the reviews were wrong. They weren't.First, ATT's ""3G"" network is VERY SLOW compared to Verizon's (my previous carrier).Second, the phone is packed with bugs and quirks. Programs (especially the music player) turn themselves on when the phone is not in use or in your pocket. This eats up battery time. Often, i take the phone out to find the battery dead because of this.The camera is ok if you plan to use photoshop to fix your pix or if you like 80's horror movie color."
2,Not expected this quality from Nokia,"I am using this phone since more than one year now. This is my first Nokia phone. And I was having great expectations from Nokia as I have got very positive reviews from my other friends and relatives though they were about Nokia as a brand and not this phone.But this phone is very disappointing. Battery life of this phone is so bad that I need to recharge this phone everyday even if usage is low. And camera is though 2 MP, quality of pictures is very bad. And it has lot of software problems too. Phone front navigation buttons for music player is not consistent and sometimes even after pressing the keys many times it does not respond.I still have a high regard for Nokia but not this phone. It may be one of the bad model Nokia is having. I will probably give a try to another Nokia phone in future."
2,get's really hot!!!,"using this phone occassionally is okay. But when i'm on the phone with family members for hour long conversation, this thing feels like it's going to explode it get's so hot. It doesn't get warm, it get's burning hot.The design is nice, the options are nice. The user interface lags a bit due to the all the options it allows for.Huge fan of nokia, not a huge fan of this phone. Nice for free though."
1,my biggest mistake,"i purchased Nokia N75 phone looks good buti have big problems with battery cover and batter power!!!both are very cheap quality.i need to recharge twise in day though i talk almost 1 hour to 2 hour, and the battery removing cover is so delicate it is coming out with out my knoweledge. i would suggest better buy another phone."
3,"A few Caveats, Pop Port a dealbreaker for many","The reviews here are all positive, so let me temper the mood a bit. I like Nokia phones, but there are some frustrating issues with this phone:-mediocre image quality (odd lens issues)-- and they stress the camera features in the description-mediocre battery life-NO headphone jack, Yes, you read it correctlyTheir are many good web reviews by magazines easily found online for this phone: they give it between 6-7 out of 10 stars/points etc."
2,fancy phone but not practical,"I have got it for two days and think I should try to stop others make the same mistake.The phone is good looking, I mean the big display, camera and music........however, the battery life is too short,even I don't make many calls, not to mention I haven't used any web browsing, vedio etc fancy functions. Becareful if you want to buy this phone."
3,Nokia N75,"This phone has an incredible camera (2mp) the video recording is splendid. The texting is a little difficult to get used to but after a little while you get the hang of it. The battery life is incredible, one charge can last two days. The speaker phone during a call is very loud and clear sounding. The music player is one of the best I've ever had on a phone.I highly recommend this phone."
1,"terrible, terrible battery life","I'm hardly a power-user; all I really need a phone for is for talking. Color me surprised when I forgot to charge the battery one evening and the phone died the next afternoon; I couldn't have talked more than 45 minutes in total. Simply atrocious battery life; it's far worse than my three-year-old Motorola, which it replaced. I really regret this purchase."
4,"A great phone, while it stays charged.","I've had this phone for about 8 months now. I got it back when it was free, with a new contract. The initial firmware is a botched headache. After I got the old firmware on it (I paid someone to load the original nokia firmware), it works like a charm. Also, AT&T; is great about giving out the unlock codes.What they all say about the battery life is sadly true. I remedy this with a car charged and a USB charger so that it can always be charging. It's a little bit of a pain, but it's a great phone, loud speakers, lots of memory, fast, big keypad."
2,Cool phone but the battery...ugh!!!,"Just had to return it because the battery life was horrible. Overall, the phone is amazing!! I did what users on this site said to do (changing the 3G setting to as needed instead of when available) but still the battery drained in a matter of hours. I have the KRZR now...not as cool as the N75, but at least the battery is still going."
4,Bad Battery but overall Awesome Phone!!!,For all those u have been having problems with the phone turning ON when in your pocket and who din know how to lock your keys that are outside...here is the solution... when u press the power button u get an option to lock keypad... select to lock the keypad and that way you dont have to worry about battery draining when in your pocket... i do accept the fact that the battery life on the N75 is not as great as any other Nokia phone... But I thot locking the phone in my pocket saves me a lot of battery... I charge my phone everyday :(... But overall it is an excellent phone...U dont get such a good phone being offered by any provider for FREE...
2,First and Last Nokia Flip Phone,"N75-All of the reviews I have read have been right on. I really liked this phone. It does alot. However I am now 16 months into a 24 month contract and this phone has not held up. It has never been dropped and always been in a protected case. I am a Nokia Fan. Every phone I have ever had has been a nokia (about 6 of them now). However, they have all also been candybar phones. The only draw back to this phone is that the ""flip hinges are cheap"" they will crack and break as mine are. Currently, mine elecrical taped together trying to wait out my contract so that I can get another phone. This time probably a Nokia 4300. Smart phone...smart of me to not get another flip phone ever. I wouldn't discourage someone from getting this phone. The features are great. Just don't buy it if you are not gentle on your phone. It wont last."
3,Could be better,"I love the style of the N75, but the quality is very poor. I accidentally dropped it once, and the entire top (the part you flip to open) cracked. It is being held by Gorilla glue at the moment, so I hope it lasts.I do like that it is user friendly and easy to navigate, even if it is a bit ""slow"".I'll be switching to something else next summer for my next upgrade."
2,Defective Hinge,"Within the first month of owning the phone I dropped it in my house (NOT hard floor). No crack or scratch was there.Weeks letter a crack started forming and eventually the hinge was coming apart.As I researched online I discovered this is quite normal. It happens often and Nokia says it's customer abuse.Not true because I know how to ABUSE a phone LOL, and I never abused this phone.Obviously they would not fix mine, nor would Cingular.I am very disappointed because it had great features, great ringtone etc...and I had to glue it 2 continue using it.Do not get this phone, research online and you will find many others who have had this problem with the hinge and Nokia refuses to admit it's theire problem."
1,Avoid!,"Many reviewers list pros, but my personal feeling is that the cons far outway any of these. Here is list of the problems:1) While some of the keys are large, the navigation ones are small and hard to press.2) Non-intuitive interface, very hard to navigate and find what you are looking for3) Battery meter goes from almost full to dead within a few minutes4) Large and bulky without redeeming features, most of the size is taken by the keypad.5) Horrible miserable cameraBeing the no 1 cell phone manufacturer seems to be corrupting Nokia. Their phones used to be solid, clean, easy to use. You could not go wrong with choosing them. Alas, this is a miserable device, which (if it ever pretends to) can not dream of competing with the iPhone.[Edit] To top it off, the phone just died. It wasnt dropped, nor used much. Nokia should be ashamed of themselves."
2,This book left me flat.,"The other reviews sing its praises, but for me this book was strident, petulant and kind of boring. Funny how a book, like a restaurant, can leave one person enthralled and another wondering what all the fuss is about. I typically distrust books that have to invent new words to encapsulate their views. The authors certainly seem sincere in their critique of just about every belief system and organizing principle, and I'm sure they have given a lot of people a lot to ponder, but the writing style is so flat and they just seem to try a little too darn hard to make their sometimes obvious and sometimes obscure points. Oh well, there's room for everyone, and one day I may have a different opinion of a book that for now seems like the whining of two very smart but not very happy people."
5,True insight into a fundamental issue we all confront,"Sometimes the important issues are hidden from us, camoflaged by their blending into the context of our daily lives. The authors of this book have done a fine job turning the spotlight on a glaring shortcoming of our daily lives, a weakness that underlies our interpretation of everything from self-help books to politics, office relations to marriage. In a nutshell, they detail the many areas in our lives where people are conditioned to sacrifice themselves, often to the benefit of others. They make an impassioned plea for a new organizational structure for human existence, one that is not based on authority and submission.Great book, excellent reading for any contemplative person."
3,Mills Brothers CD,The CD is a good product; we found we didn't like most of the songs or their slow singing.
3,Yngwie on the more melodic and slightly boring side,"I've been a fan of Yngwie for some years now and I think he released some better material in the past, e.g. Alchemy, War To End All Wars, Rising Force, Fire & Ice and of course Inspiration, to name the ones which appeal to me most. This new one becomes slightly boring and monotonous after having listened to a few pieces. Yet there are some strong points, e.g. tracks #11, #14 and #15. If you are YJM's die-hard fan then purchase it. If you wanna start with his music look for some other release (start with Rising Force where it all began)."
5,YUMMY!,Yngwie's music makes me thankful to be alive at this moment in history-this CD is no exception! I understand everyone has an opinion.What I don't understand is BRAINDEAD WISHY-WASHY FANS! Quit living in the past.A true Yngwie fan will always be.4EVERYNGWIE!
1,A really silly album,"I regret buying this. Like a previous review, the songs are silly and embarrassing to listen to. The guitaring is just a replication of Yngwies past 10 albums, and you can hear the reason why Yngwie has been bounced around record labels like a ping pong ball. His music is dia."
1,I'd give it zero if I could.,"This album is bad. Stupid songs and silly melodies. Whay YJM has not employed somebody to write lyrics for him by now beggers belief. I can't even class this as metal. It's more like robotic Eighties re-hash of neo-classical garb that really died off in the Eighties. YJM will never be a great guitarist because he cannot diversify his play. Every solo and riff is becoming or is now sounding the same. Besides the electric guitar is a rock and roll instrument not an extension of the harpsichord. If I want to hear a piece of Bach, I will listen to a pianist. If I want to hear a electric guitarist I will listen to Hendrix. YJM fits into neither."
1,the most unoriginal album i've heard.,"the musical rising force of this album was amazing, except one thing. where are ridiculously long bass intros. thats the malmsteen i love. and the drumming, i could have programmed better drumming on my mc505. yngwie stop. just stop. maybe you should start doing spoken word performances about your struggles of being a world famous ""composer."" don't forget to mention your airline incident. you need to start writing lyrics about your life, i mean ""pick up your sword, pick your shield, and get yourself unto the battlefield."" is conan the barbarian on your beta max machine on repeat. i'll meet you on the battlefield anytime, you and that ""bruce dickinson school of opera"" dropout singer doogie white. come on yngwie it's over. try something new or nothing at all. despite all this i'll be at you show to hear the one and only ""blackstar."" good luck."
2,Enough of it,"I have to give this guy credit for going on after all the setbacks he suffered along his career.But nothing can disguise the fact that he has an ego bigger than Earth, and this has plagued his career for a long time.For me, his solo career (in terms of great records), lasted three albums: RISING FORCE, MARCHING OUT and TRILOGY.After that, he embraced pop metal with the terrible ODYSSEY, and after this album things became worse and worse.Also, soon people began to realize that he composes robotically, that his music has absolutely no feel, basically due to the fact that he simply has no chemistry with the band that plays with him at a certain moment.This guy is as fast as a lightning (maybe faster!!!) but, with the dozens of notes he can play in a second, he cannot touch the metal fan like a single note of Ritchie Blackmore, Adrian Smith or Michael Schenker can.ATTACK is just another ego trip for Yngwie, and I hope he can doing what he knows to do: heartless metal."
1,Total and utter B******s.,"By now, YJM should be starting to give up. There is nothing on this album that is different from any other stuff he has ever released. Even the instrumentals sound like past tracks from the Eighties. The songs are stupid, embarrasing to listen to and some of the lyrics are plain stupid. Avoid."
2,Same album,"Once again, Yngwie has failed to progress. If you've heard one song you've heard them all. As you know, according to many guitar magazine reviews, this is the very reason he left the country; he felt he wasn't getting respect.This guy has enough talent to play anything, however it's just the same thing over and over."
1,Another cloned record,"It's already been said that this is album is the same as any previous release, and that can't be further from the truth. Yngwie Malmsteen must think that either his fans enjoy hearing the same guitar solos played over and over again, or he's not bothered as long as the bank roll is still coming in. As for the song writing, this album displays a still amatuerish as ever style. Malmsteen was good when he was in Alcatraz and his fret work of the first few albums of Rising Force are breath taking even to listen to today. Unfortunatley since then he hasn't progressed at all."
2,"Strange, somewhat useful, but a Gygaxian ego trip, IMHO.","Parts of the book are useful, but I really found nothing useful. At times, it struck me as though I was being talked down to, by someone who obviously considered himself far superior to me. I also take issue with the fact that Gygax takes most of the credit for creating D&D, giving Dave Arneson very little credit for his efforts, and his original D&D campaign, Blackmoor, which is still running today, using Arneson's original rules!If you can locate a library copy, read it, and judge for yourself. I would not recommend purchasing a copy simply because it fails to deliver on what the title promises."
4,A 'regular guy' astronauts biography,"Okay- I have almost all the astronauts biographies and so called auto- biographies.It is hard to impress me, most of the time they are over the top and you can feel the air whipping thru their scarves. Not true or impressive. But when I opened this 128 page book, my first impression was ""Hmmm, thin?""But upon reading this I was impressed. Captain Scott, who flew twice in space has done a great job -HIMSELF -in writing and telling the story of the contempoary astronaut experience. From building model airplanes and watching 'Sky King' to flying the Navy's F-14 Tomcat, becoming a NASA mission specialist and walking in space,This is a great book.A quick read, and more importantly- a fun one.You will enjoy this one."
2,Okay at best,"Too much over acting by some puppets. The Marx brothers crippled the telling of this classic tale. At fifty, I enjoy a more traditional version rather than this one which tried to be funny and missed the mark."
1,I don't know what they were thinking,"I don't know what they were thinking. The music is incredible. But, the story went back and forth from behind-the-stage scenes to the narrator (Sting) sitting in the audience. I love Sting, but his puppet character was chewing the scenery in the worst way. The goose was depicted as a drunk--why would somebody do this when targeting a children's audience. All of the puppet characters were over acted. I am not against a fresh interpretation of this great story. But I think you lost the story with all of the characters hamming it up to the extreme. I thought it was awful. I watched it all, not believing my eyes, and I couldn't wait for it to be over."
3,Not traditional,"The performance is excellent, and the puppets are excellent. The story of the whole fantasy is a little odd, however. I purchased this for use in teaching Music Appreciation, and this recording will probably not suit that use. The video is very funny, in a British humor way, but it's hard to follow the little jabs unless the viewer is already quite literate--musically and verbally. Also, you have to read the box insert before it makes any sense at all. It does not stand by itself."
2,Misleading title,"This is not the book that I was looking it had a misleading title. I want to return it, I did find the book."
5,Speechless,Have you ever wanted to hear music that you know the person is singing from the bottom of their heart and putting everything they have in it? Garnett Silk can sing to me all night long. He is one of the best reggae artists i have heard in my life. Rest in Peace!
4,History's Mysteries--Alaska's Bermuda Triangle,"It was very interesting. I had no idea that existed. I can dimly remember a fuss about Hale Boggs, but I was newly married at the time and not paying much attention to politics. I take this disappearance stuff with a grain of salt, not to say a whole shaker full of salt, but it's still interesting."
2,Boring Beginning of a Great Series,"I picked this book up because I've read, and adored, the Best Lesbian Erotica 1999, 2000 and 2001 editions. I figured the book that started it all of couldn't be bad. I was wrong. The first story is about.....eating glue as a child in kindergarten. Impressively not erotic. About half the stories in this collection don't have any actual sex in them, and few of the stories that have to do with sex are actually arousing. I skipped over two stories as too boring and confusing to bother with, and had to force myself to make it to the end (where I was rewarded by a hot story by Pat Califia). Don't trying to track this down, as most of the few good stories in it are reprinted in Best of Best of Lesbian Erotica."
4,Very warm and snuggly,"While I overall liked the costume, I always wash costumes before wear. The inside lining shredded so that was kind of a pain. But it didn't affect the outside at all and it was still VERY warm and snuggly. In some ways, it might be better for outside use than inside use for that reason. My little one really did look adorable though!"
3,"Great table, with a misprint","I used the table in my sixth grade science class, and they were able to follow along and use it very well. I like the way it looks and provides plenty of info., more than I thought actually. There is a misprint, however. Above each column there are roman numerals. There are two roman numeral sevens, rather than a seven column and an eight column. Besides that it's a great poster."
5,Just love Burn Notice!,"This movie is a must for anyone who loves Burn Notice. It is well written, has a great story line, and the acting is superb. It is great to see more of Sam!"
3,It wasn't amazing...,"But it was worth watching. It fit into the style of Burn Notice well in my opinion. Others may not think so, but I would definitely buy the DVD when it comes out. As for the rest of you, wait for it to air again and decide for yourself."
3,Extended edition?,"While this preorder gives little info. about the BD, I just received season 4 DVDs for ""Burn Notice."" Inside is a flier stating that this is an extended version (with some ""making of"" bits, too). The movie was about 88 minutes long. This is listed at 108 minutes (assuming this time does not include the included extras). Not sure how they could pad this for another 20 minutes. Perhaps, though, the ""extended cut"" part will influence some to buy this.The movie itself was okay. A bit pat, but a fun time, if one's expectations aren't too high."
2,Good show / bad price,I enjoyed watching this show on USA and I am a big Bruce Campbell fan - but $10 for what is a 2 hour TV show is ridiculous. I'm not buying it.
2,Badly Thought Out B-Movie,"I've loved Burn Notice for many years. It's a new type of spy show and the interplay between the characters is great. It was my introduction to Bruce Campbell, so when I heard of this movie coming out, I was very excited.Unfortunately, everything that makes Burn Notice work is missing from this badly plotted action flick. Without Jeffrey Donovan to bounce off of(except for a brief cameo), Bruce Campbell. . .well, he does his best with the script he was given.In the end, ""The Fall of Sam Axe"" comes off more like a 1930s Saturday matinee film than a smart, sexy, modern movie. I had so much higher hopes."
2,Trite and contrived low budget hack job,"An obvious low budget movie. Oh so typical cute street wise...sorry...jungle wise tough talking teenage girl. Cute but inept guerrilla ""army"" and evil dressed in black bad guys. Shock none of the bad guys had the requisite gang tats. Poor writing throughout. I think it was obvious to me these were different writers than the ones doing the weekly Burn Notice. It took little thought to figure out what was going to happen next. Sam was a Commander, Navy SEAL, a SAILOR not a soldier as he was called. The guards were dressed as MP's, Military Police (army) not SP or Shore Patrol (navy). Worst of all Sam's Navy dress uniform didn't fit him, his shoulder boards looked like they were going to come off any second. The whole movie had a Disney like quality about it. All it needed was a small cute child to look up to Sam and say ""Thank you mister for saving us from the bad men."""
2,NOT Burn Notice,"Let me start by saying, I'm a big fan of the Burn Notice show, especially the snarky interplay between the main characters. That said, this isn't Burn Notice. Sure it's Sam Axe, and Michael shows up briefly, but without Michael and Fiona's characters, the writers had to work too hard to come up with something entertaining. Unfortunately, this isn't it. Anyone who is familiar with the show knows that there's a lot of improbabilities in the script. (...a never-ending supply of C-4? Really?) But they went too far on this one and I found myself relieved when it was over."
2,It's ok.,"For a TV movie, it's ok, but I wouldn't watch it again. Kinda just moves along like a twig going down a river - kinda slow and methodical. I didn't get the vibe it was Burn Noticed based on the TV series because it's really different. I don't see how anyone gives it higher than 3 stars. Definitely wait for it to come on TV - that's where I saw it."
2,"Weak story, adds nothing to the franchise","Meh.A made-for-tv story with low(ish) budget values... attempts were made to make Sam Axe appear younger but all this aside, the story was very weak and added zero IMHO to the overall series.If you enjoy the show then you *might* like this episode... but Michael Westen barely appears and to me there's little to elaborate on the Sam persona that might add value to the tv show itself.It all feels a little pandering and derivative. If you're hungry for a meal, just take note that this is a light snack. And not tasty-popcorn-indulgence type snack either... more like chip shards and leftover guacamole dip from last night."
3,A nice back story,"I love the show and when I saw this come out I could not wait to watch it. The story has a slight Burn Notice feel to it be is centered round Sam Ax's charater. The over all story was good but I felt that the female aid worker let the team down - not sure if it was a bad charater or a bad actor but she just did not ring true. While the ending felt a little bit rushed and Sam seemed to be able to talk his way out of the mess he was in with a few photos. Over all it was an enjoy able movie with Michael making a guest appearance. Sam talks a lot about drinking but never takes a sip while on the mission. It was his drinking and love all woman nature that gets him into the main part of the story.DVD extras - there is some sort of inside joke on ""the fall of Jeffery Donovan"" it got a bit weired...If you are a fan of burn notice you will like the back story on Sam Ax - directed by Jeffery Donovan he gives the charater he knows so well from the show, a chance to stand in the spot light."
5,Loved the movie,After watching this on tv and on my online device i wanted the DVD so i could watch it any time. The dvd was worth the money and I hope to but other DVDs in the series.
5,It's Comedy-Action-Adventure,"I couldn't stop laughing. Blue camouflage in the jungles of South America? Man, oh man, that Admiral sure wanted him to get killed. Talk about a guy with and Punch and Judy problem; Sam Axe is the poster guy. I can't wait for the DVD release. I will buy it. Bruce Campbell brings years of TV acting experience to this really unique role. You gotta like the Sam Axe character to like this film though. You're not gonna see Gabrielle Anwar parading in a miniskirt, or Jeffrey Donovan in one of his many alter ego spy roles, but you will get some good Sammy time. Easy-squeezy!"
2,Low Budget and Low Expectations,"Even with low expectations, this tv movie didn't hit the mark. Bruce Campbell just couldn't save this project from it's incredibly low budget effects and the re-hashed (seen it a million times) plot.Noticeably absent was the traditional Bruce Campbell humor which usually can drag these types of movies to a positive review."
2,Don't get burned by buying this DVD,"After hearing about this movie during Comic Con I had such high hopes for it.After watching the show it would have been better for Bruce to have his own two hour episode of Burn Notice.It just seems like it was rushed into production to fit in between seasons of the series and it shows.Chemistry is hard enough to get between characters I don't know why they messed with it.This will more than likely rerun right before the new season of Burn Notice if you missed it before.""New info"" The Blu-ray and maybe the DVD will have a extended version available."
1,"Depressing, full of doubt, no real answers","I started this book, really liked it, and about halfway through it realized that the author's message is one of doubt and questioning. There are some good messages in it, but wading through all the negativity was quite disheartening. For an atheist or someone just starting to think about prayer, the presentation of so many negative points of view might actually be comforting, as an echo of their own thoughts. For someone who doesn't need to be drawn in and convinced that there are some possible benefits to prayer, this book became a burden.I do like the author's style of writing, and I believe he means well. There are some glaring errors when compared with what the Bible actually says about prayer. I found myself feeling sadder and praying less while reading this book. I had to shake it off. The book is definitely not for me. I ended up wondering which side of the issue he really falls on."
5,Prayer: Does It Make Any Difference?,"This is an absolutely profound, insightful, challenging and encouraging look at prayer from a Biblical perspective. I am reading it a few segments at a time and have bought copies to share and encourage friends."
1,"Lots of Questions, No real answers","If you enjoy reading personal accounts of peoples struggles in life and prayer this book may be for you. But if you are truly interested in a solid biblical understanding of prayer, look elsewhere. While the chapter titles would lead you believe there is substance to be found, the content is sadly lacking. Dr. Yancey seems to believe that we can learn about prayer from just about anyone....Mother Teresa, Oscar Wilde, Bono...to be fair, he also quotes from many fine biblical scholars, but it all seems to come to the same man centered conclusions. In an effort to be all inclusive, the author leaves the reader with very few clear truths to understand the critical importance and privilege of prayer. Perhaps it is a sign of our times that so many other reviews would see this book as helpful. My conclusion is clearly otherwise. Psalm 62:8 NKJV"
2,A great disappointment.,Let me summarize for you. Who knows if prayer works? Who knows why God answers some prayers and not others? I ususally like Yancy but he really disappoints with this effort.
4,Prayer - by Philip Yancey,"Interesting book - but I got bogged down as I moved to the half-way point. Seems like a lot of extra words were added to increase the size of the book. Maybe I'm a little impatient, but I'd like to see it structured differently. Make a list of all the major points by chapter - and then make the case for each point."
4,Surprisingly engaging without seeming segmented,"Because J.G. Marking, one of my favorite Christian authors, quotes Yancey numerous times in his book ""A Voice Is Calling,"" I decided to try out Yancey's latest work.To say that I was surprised at Yancey's writing ability would be an understatement. Despite the somewhat open-ended discussion and somewhat unfinished feel of the book, which I both liked and disliked, I could not tear myself away from Yancey's verbal acumen and mastery of engaging his audience.If you ever really struggle with prayer or wonder what prayer can or does actually accomplish, I highly recommend this book and Richard Foster's ""Prayer,"" they book can do nothing but aid your effort to draw near to God."
5,Yancy asks the question,A good investigation of Prayer and how it affects our lives and our perception of it. The references in the book are also good in learning about other Christians and their beliefs. Yancy is like a guide- always asking questions and taking you further down the path.
4,Does it?,"This book was really awesome. Yancey is becoming on of my favorite Authors. He does a great job tackling a tough topic. He does a great job of giving examples of all kinds of prayers, from around the world."
5,"Yancey, Prayer: Does It Make Any Difference.","I have never found a Phil Yancey book that has not been a wonder and delight to read. No matter how ""used"" the subject may seem, Yancey finds new and enlightening views and insights that keep me looking for additional books he has written. Yancey is one of my favorite authors."
5,A wonderful book,"Philip Yancey does it every time. Yet this is THE best of his books that I have ever read. A fresh new perspective on prayer in his usual down to earth, exposed manner. He is not ashamed to voice those very questions and doubts that we all have and search for earnest answers that make a lot of sense. A must read!"
4,thought provoking,"I like to read Philip Yancey's books because he tackles hard questions and, as far as I can tell, comes to the aching void with an open heart and mind, seeking God's answers. Through prayer we approach the throne of the almighty God, so we should expect to have questions and to sometimes find the answers shrouded in mystery. Yancey doesn't claim complete enlightenment; he encourages us, as a fellow seeker, in the journey to find the answers ourselves. After reading it I took heart to pray boldly, even to argue with God, and yet the book also reminded me that sometimes the desired answers don't come. Some of the stories discouraged me and caused me to stop and wait on God for the answers, but even so I recommend the book, for God blesses the pondering of such things."
4,Encouraging,This is a great book to encourage more meaningful prayer in your life. It's a little deep and intense though- not a quick read. I got a lot out of this book.
3,Book order,"My order was placed on March 23. I received the book on April 15. That was the longest I had ever waited to receive something ordered through Amazon. The book came in excellent condition. It was purchased for a Bible study group. I missed having it for two weeks of study, but will catch up."
1,A Book About Prayer From An Open Theist,"I won't go into all the reasons why I think this is a very poor book on prayer because there are many. But one glaring example of Yancey""s beliefs can be found in the last sentence of the second paragraph on page 241: ""Rarely do we get everything we want, and I imagine the same holds true for God.""Talk about ""Open Theism""!For a truly excellent book on prayer read Answered Prayer Guaranteed! by Frederick K. C. Price."
2,A-hem...,"I haven't read this calculus text, but based on the quality of the last review (and in consideration of who the reviewer claims to be), I've got two words for ya: ""STAY AWAY!"""
1,Less than Worthless,This product will either slow your system way down or lock it up altogether. There are better products for masking your IP address that are free; don't waste your money on this one.
4,Must read if new to the country,"I just moved into the United States and wanted to know how do personal savings, the bank, financial planning, housing, taxes, retirement etc...This book gives a very consolidated overview will all the nitty-gritty about how personal finance should & is handled in United States. Recommended to anyone new to the US or just off schools entering the REAL WORLD. Also gets you acquainted with the local financial terms."
2,Classic American Autobiographies,The pages in the book were loose; they came out as I read the book. Poor quality.
2,Core Humanities,"I had to read this for school. It was boring and totally uneventful. I would prefer sparknotes or audio version to get through it faster. If you have ot read for school, I feel your pain."
5,Sign Language 101,"This is a FANTASTIC dvd for anyone wanting to begin learning ASL! The signers have a wonderful sense of humor and are so funny! Also at the end of the dvd there is information about their facebook fan page where you can get free video lessons, participate in quizzes and win beautiful jewelry prizes! Gilda one of the signers answers you personally and is such a sweet person! I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE Everyday ASL Productions, Ltd and I have purchased EVERY single dvd as well as other fun iteams from their online store!"
3,Eh,"I was a little disappointed by this purchase. The signs are clearly shown, but they are presented in lists and never used together to make sentences or build on each other--which isn't ideal for memorization/learning."
2,Okay,It was okay. Not what I hope it would be. This video was a little helpful. It was too short and some of the signing was a little too fast and you had to start from the beginning to see it again
2,Beginning sign video,"I had mixed feelings about this video. The signs themselves were wonderfully depicted. However, it looked like a low budget, poorly put together production. Very imperfect slides, missing some images, others getting stuck in one place, The paragraphs used had worthy content, but they moved across the screen too quickly and sometimes skipped half a page. I cannot recommend this video although thereis definited potential if they can get their graphic etc together. I will be contacting the company to see if they have a newer production they will send free of charge, This one just didn't cut it."
1,Poor quality,"The first attempt at this gift, the middle fell out, then the second attempt the entire stone cracked in half. Do not recommend this product"
3,Takes a few days to do,"This is a cool craft. I wish it was faster drying and that the border wasn't bugs and lizards, but it was a nicegift for family members with a handprint in it."
1,Can I give NO STARS?!?!,"These cats can't hold Wu's jewelry, let alone share a part of their name. Being affiliated with Wu Tang should be a crime. My dog can write better lyrics, and my sneeze has a better beat. Can you say comatose? The best part of the CD is the logo..."
5,THIS CD RULES,I BOUGHT THIS CD LAST WEEK AND IT IS OFF THE HOOK WITH BEATS AND HARDCORE RAPPIN BY THIS CD ITS WORTH YOUR MONEY ALL THE WAY YOU WONT REGRET IT!
1,Garbage...,"Im a fan of wutang,killarmy,wu-renegade, sunz of man but gp wu is just plain wack. First the beats? Dey wack & lirycs? I've heard better even their name is pretty gay. Black on black crime is one of the worse songs i've heard. Don't buy GP WU'S "" Don't Go Against the Grain"" coz its corny , wack, and boring with terrible beats. Not recommended."
2,Phenomenal blast of citurs and musk,"There is no staying power with Oceanic. But, while it lasts, it's a lovely and enchanting fragrance. If it had more staying power, it would be my #1 fragrance. But it just does not last more than five minutes. Pity. It's just the best... while it lasts."
5,One of my favorite garden tools,These pruners are really helpful cutting roses. No scratches or cuts from thorns and easy to handle.
5,Just what I needed,These slides were just what I needed!! I even called Kodak and they couldn't help me. Thank you soooo much!!!
2,Directory of what?,This is a booklet of charts for the Maldives. The scale is too small and depth is not shown. The coordinates at the end go only to full minutes so are hardly usable. My electronic charts are much better. I expected a lot more!
5,This Girl Rocks,"I first heard about Joy in CCM and decided to check her out. Today they're are so many new artist out they're that you don't know what your getting. But Joy is one of the many people out they're that has a voice. And is using it for god. They're is ten songs on this cd. The first five are more upbeat such as No Less, It's All Good and Up. Then they're are the ballads such as Do they see Jesus In Me, and the more slower songs. She has a voice similuar to Jessica Simpson and Christina Aguilera but is using it to honor God! I definitely recommend this to anyone!"
5,Wonderful!,"This is an excellent CD! Contemporary Christian music fans will love this! It is a great mix of slow songs and fast songs, with a clear message of how great God is."
5,A Real Classic,This is an excellently crafted work taking the reader through the history of of a truly All American division as it trains for and invades Normandy. Numerous accounts and descriptions give this division its rightful place in history. Truly one of the best divsional histories intwined with numerous stories of those who particpated.
4,a great review of a WW 2 division,"The author does a fine job of describing an Infantry Division during the invasion of France in 1944. It goes into great detail on the training of this mostly National Guard unit.The book has great maps, and is a great tool for any student of military history."
4,Division of note,"A solid work. Balkoski's marketing of this edition benefits from the overused Ambrose cache. Otherwise, the writing style is workmanlike, instead of inspiring or greatly illuminating. ""Beachhead"" reads like the late-assembled memoirs of a veteran, many years after the events. The story is worth telling, but the story drags at times.The maps are appreciated and generally good, a real plus given the details. Too many works of this genre leave geography to the imagination."
5,"Long way to the ""Beach"".........","Joseph Balkowski writes about WWII as though he were there. In ""Beyond the Beachhead"" the story of ""Omaha Beach"" and the 29th Infantry Division come alive. If you are looking for the real story of this momentous event in history, and how a ""National Guard"" Division came to be the lead-in INf. Div. to the D-Day Invasion, this is the BOOK (knowing that the U.S. 82nd & 101st with the 6th British airborne dropped in first).A must read for all WWII readers.Bruce"
3,Bittersweet,"This is a disturbing film worth seeing. The subject of the film, Arthur ""Killer"" Kane, seems to be in a trance as do all the other ""Mormons"" in the film. Arthur is obviously a kind hearted & talented man but seems eerily empty & lost, particularly in contrast to the other gifted musicians in the film like Morissey & David Johansen. I can't shake the feeling that this was meant to be an LDS propaganda film gone terribly wrong. After wathcing this I felt like I'd just driven by a bad car crash..."
5,A glorious portrait,"Even if you have no idea who the New York Dolls were, and even if you dislike rock and roll, NEW YORK DOLL is still a touching and vibrantly alive film. It's a sin this movie came and went in 2005 with little fanfare -- it's easily one of the best of last year.The few extras are top notch, particularly the stand alone version of the hymn David Johansen sings during the credits. After experiencing the final five minutes of the movie, hearing his rendition of that piece will tingle your spine.A GREAT documentary."
5,Amazing!!!,"I was blown away by this movie and recommend it to everyone. I ran across it while at the Sundance Film Festival and almost didn't get to see it as every show was sold out. I hope they come out w/ an extended version w/ tons of extra footage because I'll buy that one as well.Can't wait for the April DVD release. Definietly a ""must have"" movie no matter who you are or what you are into."
4,A summer to remember(i love cheese),"Well, as much as the title track is great, it's the live versions of 2 of the most wonderful and underrated BFF tracks, Tom and Mary, and Emiline, that make this worth buying. And the front cover is definately one of the best ideas for a new tattoo I've seen in a long time"
5,John Patrick is fantastic,I have numerous tapes of his work and their is none better than John Patrick at explaining what has to do with gambling and his conservative approach.
5,Dr. Drew's the Man!,"Dr Drew is a man with an amazing gift. He has a great sense of knowledge, and it show in both the way he teaches, and the way he writes. He has the power to move students, and help them to pursue achieving their goals.Bringing a love of karaoke and music to life in his book, Dr. Drew takes you on a ride through the life of the Karaoke World.If your a fan of any type of music, you'll love the book, and just imagine the writer of the book performing one of his favorite toons, the Scorpions ""Rock You Like a Hurricane!"""
1,product NOT as described,This image is not correct neither is the alt image. I e-mailed and asked if the description was correct and was told it was. I ordered it and what arrived was a pack of gum sized simple card reader. Product is not as discribed or pictured. Amazon has been made aware.
5,Not Just For Bicycle Fans,"I first read this book in the sixties in grade school. I bought the reissued edition, rediscovering it by coincidence. Ms. Murphy's journey in the early sixties is, if anything, more fascinating to read today in light of the changes in the Middle East since she travelled there. Her independence and cheerful acceptance of different cultures is refreshing. This book was written prior to the 'me' decade, and while intensely personal, lacks the self-preoccupation that more recent writers practice.Additionally, unlike so many bicycle travelogues, this book doesn't focus on the author's bicycle! The focus remains on the journey, which renders it excellent reading for all, not just bicyclists.This is a timeless read and one that can be revisited with pleasure."
5,great book,quite an interesting historical look at middle east and a very brave women back in the 70's i would not be so brave
3,Enjoyable But Falls Apart,"In ""Laughing Man"", one could argue that the story falls apart the same as the character does. That his world spirals into madness and confusion, and we, as readers, are expected to take the ride with him. Okay, that's fine. I understand. But confusion does not satisfy my need for a solid, scary story. I'm someone who needs a payoff. Yes, the book is well written and starts off very powerful, but I had to work hard to get through the last 100 pages. I usually love this writer, and although I was still entertained by ""Laughing Man"", I would recommend some of T.M.'s other work for new readers. ""The Last Vampire"" and ""Sleepeasy"" are both much better."
1,Worst Ever,"While it makes sense now that I find out this is part of a series, as a stand alone novel, well, it's without question the worst book I've ever read. I'm always angry when I waste time reading an entire book that is as foul as this one, I always like to give a book the benefit of the doubt. I should have stopped reading after the first chapter. If you're a fan, I suppose you're reading the series, if you are considering reading this as a stand alone, don't. Even if it's free, even if you are stranded on a deserted island and it's the only book that washes up with you. You'll be disappointed in the complete lack of plot, ridiculous characters, and completely unsatisfactory 'ending'."
1,Very Little River Band,"I'm a long time fan of the band. I have seen them live many times, and have all of their previous releases. I was sorry that my schedule this summer didn't allow me to catch their recent US Tour- until I heard this CD.At first listen, I thought I must have grabbed one of my kids CDs by mistake (Backstreet Boys on the Muzak label?). Few of the regular band members are left, and none of its sound. The new material is bland, and the re-records of their old songs are not nearly as good as the originals. The vocals have the generic sound of commercial jingles, and even the instrumental backgrounds are uninspired.Before I bought this, I was looking forward to a new CD by LRB- I still am."
3,First LRB album in 12 years,"LITTLE RIVER BAND'S first true album release in twelve years is an impressive collection of fresh original songs, performed by a regrouped contemporary rock band. With WAYNE NELSON doing most of the lead vocals and STEPHEN HOUSDEN'S extraordinary guitar playing plus the typical stylistic attributes Where We Started From was instantly and wholeheartedly welcomed by the fans. Other than nine new originals the band recorded remakes of ""The Night Owls"" and ""Cool Change"" [which they had better left untouched, in my opinion]. The more you listen to this album, the more you enjoy its sophisticated arrangements. WAYNE contributes his wonderful and heartbreaking ""Who Made The Moon"", a memorial as well as his musical contribution to his pet project, the Angel House Shelter Foundation."
2,...,"The voice of Wayne Nelson is as good as ever but the quality of the songs that they have recordered on this cd are very average. When listening back to the quality of the songs that Goble, shorrock, and co recorded in there hey day you can see why they did sell millions of records in the 1977/to1983 years.To all those LRB fans go out and by the classics as they the true Little River Band and the quality is there."
1,They may have the name.....,but this is not the Little River Band. Comparing this group with the originals is like comparing Wings with the Beatles i.e Wings was an average band made competent by the uniqueness of McCartney....the Beatles were special. Draw the same comparison between the psuedo LRB and the real LRB.....
3,NOT LRB,"Are the Beatles without any of the Fab 4 ""The Beatles""Would you listen to ""The Eagles"" without Glen or Don?Mark is ""Dire Strait""Does ""Rolling Stones"" have Mick and Keith??????So....LRB without Glen, Beeb and Graham is Music Piracy..."
1,The Little River BLAND,"Folks - don't be fooled by this cover band. This isn't the real Little River Band, but merely a bunch of imposters making a living off of the name. The songs are barely mediocre and the vocals come nowhere near those of the REAL Little River Band.Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this CD -- spend your money on the 2CD Rhino hits package --> that way you'll hear the REAL LRB."
3,Welcome Back,"As a LRB fan from way back, I was pleased to hear this new CD. Wayne Nelson (who sang lead vocals for The Night Owls) is now lead singer and does an adequate job. I miss former lead vocalist Glenn Shorrock - but that's part of the past for now. Where We Started From, Who Made the Moon and Lead Me to Water are the stand out songs for me. The remakes of Night Owls and Cool Change are pleasant but unnecessary. Overall, the vocals are classic LRB. Wayne and Stephen Housden - the only remaining players from the 80's - are joined by 3 newcomers who live up to expectations. This is no groundbreaking masterpiece, but the more you play it, the more it sticks with you. If you are a LRB fan, this is worth adding to your collection."
4,Pretty darn good!!!,"While I certainly understand the previous reviewer's criticism, I think it is unnecessarily harsh. I too wasn't expecting much with this release. Little River Band has never been known for consistency among band members, so I was prepared for new voices. However, this was the first studio record they've released without any songs written by Graham Goble, Beeb Birtles, or Glenn Shorrock, the men responsible for LRB's trademark sound... breathtaking harmonies, and complex, difficult key changes.That said, there are still some great songs on this CD. I particularly enjoy ""I Think I Left My Heart With You"", ""Who Made the Moon"", and ""American Way"". Maybe they aren't Little River Band songs as we're used to hearing them. But give the CD a chance, you may be as pleasantly surprised as I was."
5,Awesome,I love this CD. Yea sure.....the originals are long gone...but love it anyway. Took a long time for me to get it here...but I'm glad I waited.....WELL worth the wait.Great Job guys...now come to Italy will you?How about Europe?
2,Letting off steam,"This iron, made in China, worked for less than a year. Now it shuts off while ironing, and the only way to turn it back on is to replug the cord into the outlet; a few seconds afterwards, the iron shuts off again. Not being masochistic, I will avoid Black and Decker ""Professional"" irons in the future."
1,Disappointing,"The iron was heavier than I used to. The worst part is that it never seems to be hot enough to iron my cotton shirt. I did used the steam, but it just wasn't working. I returned it, the shipping was not refunded. So, I lost about $7-8 just to try it out. Next time, I would just buy it at the store, you can return it without losing any money"
2,Ought to work for more than a year and a half,"I got this for the wife, ""a quilter"", one who uses her iron(s). It is titled ""professional"" yet molded white on white letters on the back are ""for household use only"". In this case with less than six months actual use the unit decided not to work. Indicator lights light up and all but no heat. ""FixIt For Ya"" has an appliance repair person responding to someone else s inquiry that B&D engineer their irons to be impregnable, for 'throw away' service. I appears I need to throw it away and buy a Rowenta brand whatever that is the pro-quilters here are talking about"
5,Changed My Life,"This book has changed my life. It is excellently written and comes from the heart.I cried when I first read it. It taught me so much about integrity, the author and the prophet Daniel. The book is worth a million dollars. The author should charge more for it.Loved every moment of it!!!"
5,Esoteric and absolutely brilliant,"Astounding scholarship. I am a non-academic with broad interests in art history, history, and art connoisseurship, and am fairly widely read in the history of the Rennaissance. The chapter on Botticelli's Primavera is one of the greatest pieces of art history criticism I have ever come across. For anyone who is interested in the meanings of paintings and their iconography, this book is a must. Also, I would recommend Jean Seznec's 'The Survival of the Pagan Gods"" as a companion piece. As an aside, these works, especially the Wind, give further credence to Johan Huizenga's theories elaborated in ""The Waning/Autumn of the Middle Ages""."
5,Steam Iron,"We researched this iron on Consumer Reports and it stands up to the review. Powerful and easy to use - making the necessity of ironing more pleasureable. Previously owned an expensive Rowenta which lasted only 3 years. Great buy, this model was hard to find but the Consumer Reports high recommendation in most catagories.AW"
3,ironing queen,"I make a lot of lap quilts and I need a dependable iron that can press through several layers of cloth. I have found this iron is reliable and gets the job done. However, it does leak water sometimes and this can be very frustrating when ironing a quilt for sewing."
3,OK but nothing special,The iron works OK but it is nothing to rave about. It gets plenty hot but does not steam as well as other irons I have had. It has a huge water reservoir and seems to quit steaming at about 1/3 to 1/4 full so you end up refilling just as often. The auto shutoff is a little too fast -- I am a quilter so I am back and forth to the iron a lot. However it is nice after the auto shut off to just hit the button and it comes back on to the setting you had previously selectd. Overall it is acceptable for a mid-priced product.
2,Not so happy,"I bought this iron based on all of the great reviews, but a few things are disappointing.The sole plate doesn't slide well. I was looking at Teflon or ceramic sole plates, but figured that stainless steel should be fine. Every other iron I've owned has been SS, but this iron seems to grab the fabric causing it to bunch up. I end up ironing a lot of wrinkles into the fabric and they don't come out easily.Also, when I turn it off, the red light on the handle stays on forever and the handle remains warm. I'm not in the habit of unplugging my iron every time I'm done, but now I have to for peace of mind. It's kind of a pain.Another thing, one day I laid it down so my cats wouldn't knock it off the board. I came in a couple of hours later and every drop of water had leaked out all over the floor.I'm in the process of returning it now.Other than that, it heats up fast and steams well. It's just not for me."
2,Disappointed,"Bought this fairly expensive iron for the steam, spray and safety features. Just about the time the warranty ran out on this iron, the spray function stopped working for no obvious reason. I am usually handy at repairing small appliances (have a 41 year old Hoover vacuum that I have ""rebuilt"" over time and it is still going strong as my ""garage vac"")and this no-spray seemed like potentially a minor fix. Turned out that there is no visible or obvious way to disassemble the iron to get to the spray function without doing damage. Still use this iron as a back up steam iron, but this purchase confirmed for me that Black & Decker are, like a lot of other appliance manufacturers, producing disposable junk and I will never buy another B&D product."
1,duked twice,"I promptly received my supposedly new iron. Upon opening the shipping box I noticed the manufacture box was dented. When I tried to use the iron the digital reader was broken and the iron dripped all over the place. I was promptly sent another one only to find that the gauge was broken and loose, again water was dripping terribly. I have a large family and work, I don't have time for this! I need an iron to iron my clothes, not have it sitting around to use as a weapon or a paper weight! Make sure you read the return policy!Black & Decker D2030 Auto-Off Digital Advantage IronThis item got one star because you can't rate it no stars. I EXPECTED BETTER FROM BLACK AND DECKER!"
2,Dead after 3 Months,I absolutely loved this iron. It WAS one of the best products I ever bought. I read other's warnings about how fast it broke and I hoped it was just their iron - not. I am definately not going to buy another one after reading how many stopped working so fast.
4,Great Iron at Reasonable Price,"Used my iron the day it arrived. The user interface is friendly and functions well. The iron heats quickly. This iron is fabulous. Glides effortlessly, comfortable in the hand, easy to fill, easy-to-read display, and cord stays out of the way. This iron is the reasonable weight."
5,I LOVE this iron!,"After 3 different Rowenta irons leaking like crazy on my fabrics, I had had enough and decided to made a change. I bought this Black & Decker D2030 iron after reading the great reviews from one of the blogs I visit and again when I found it here on Amazon.com. It's easy to read the digital temperature setting and I appreciate that it also clearly shows which fabric the temperature is intended. The iron heats up fast and glides over my fabrics whether it's acrylic or wool. The water reservoir is easy to fill and easy to view the water level. I often use the vertical steam for my rayon tops and it quickly erases the wrinkles with a few blasts of steam. It's not too heavy but heavy enough to feel like it's going to do it's job without any extra help from me. I like that it has automatic shut off after a few minutes which is helpful when I'm sewing. Over all, I'm really happy with this iron and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new steam iron."
4,Reliable Iron,I have found this iron to be easy to use. I can use plain water. The steam function works well and the temperature options are clear and facilitate easy ironing of various types of fabric. It heats quickly and changes temperature quickly. It is a good buy!
4,good but heavy,"we like this iron and it's features (heats quickly, digital readout, the fact that you can use tap water not just distilled) but both my daughter and myself find it to be very heavy."
4,clothes iron,"Black & Decker D2030 Auto-Off Digital Advantage IronSo far so good, for only fourty bucks you can't go wrong! As other reviewers said its great, the steamer option was what I was looking for. To steam some wrinkes out of a shirt it heats fast and plenty of steam. My fingers do sometimes move the steam dial,but can live w/it. Loveing it!"
4,Nice Iron,"Nice Iron. Works as advertized! Just a little funky on the steam setting, it's harder to see. The heat setting is easy to see and use."
5,The best iron I've ever owned,"This iron is awesome. I love the feel of a heavy iron and love the feature of being able to adjust the steam output. This iron glides like it's on a cushion of air. I liked it so much, I ordered a second one as a gift."
5,Black and Decker...Movin' on Up!,"I purchased this iron to replace a lower-end Black and Decker model (it was still going strong, but just decided to upgrade). I chose this model over the Rowenta brand because of the many positive Amazon reviews. I am thrilled with the quality, durability, and performance of this iron. The only drawback is that even with super saver FREE shipping, I could have purchased the item off the shelf for a lesser price at a ""low price leader"" store. At any rate, I kind of look forward to ironing now...."
2,"Loved it, now disappointed!!","I bought this iron in July of 2007 and loved it. I loved the digital display functions that you could set to the material you were ironing. I iron as much as the average person and I am sad to say this iron did not last. Six months later, in January 2008, the iron just stopped heating up! The lights come on, the display works, but it does not get hot! I surely hope there is some warranty on this item. I would check the warranty information before I purchase this. It was a good product I paid good money for, but now it is seemingly worthless. For the price, it should have lasted longer."
4,Iron,Does a good job but very heavy. Calls for tap water but after one month hard water deposits have filled in the steam holes. Easy settings. Not as hot as my former iron. Does not glide as well as my former iron. But good iron and highly rated by Consumer Reports.
5,I absolutely love this iron!,"What's not to love?! This iron is heavy so you don't have to work as hard; it has a large water reservoir; I love the digital settings that designate the best temp for each type of cloth being ironed; and it feels good to the hand. I had a high end Rowenta prior to this, but it's the Black & Decker D2030 that I highly recommend and I'm so glad I purchased it."
5,great iron,Black & Decker D2030 Auto-Off Digital Advantage Iron / great iron works well on every setting and was easy to set and very hi-tech .
4,Good Product,"This iron works as advertised. I like the strong steam system. I have noticed that the water input lid seals closed with a small piece of plastic and agree with other reviewers that it will be important to avoid breaking it. The reason it would be easy to break: you have to pull hard on the lip of the lid to open it, and the inner clip to seal it is right next to the outer lip."
5,FANTASTIC IRON!,I love how the iron beeps when it has reached your desired temperature setting. The backlight numberals on the dial are easy to read even from a distance.Its just a great looking and well functioning iron.
4,It gets hot,"I was thrilled to read review on an iron that would actually iron out ironed-in creases, and it does really get hot. Design could be a little better as I prefer the design of my Rowenta, but to have an iron that does what it should is worth a few flaws. Overall I am really pleased."
1,Price jump from $39 to $64.99 = absurd. Did something happen to B&D's supply chain?,"What on earth (or in China) caused Amazon to raise the price of this iron by more than 50%!? Pricegrabber.com's price tracker shows $49 as the high point for the D2030 over the last 7 months. This iron is a fair deal at $39 but a rip off imo at $65.In fact, the increase is so out-of-the-norm for this sort of consumer product that I'm honestly wondering if something major happened to B&D;'s supply chain. Did a major factory in China go offline? Was the model discontinued? Most other online retailers are showing 'out of stock' so clearly something is up.That said, whatever the cause may be, I definitely will not be purchasing another D2030 at Amazon's current $64.99 price point."
3,Good iron...but !,"Pretty good-sized iron for guys with pretty good-sized hands. Super slick ss sole plate...unit is capable of putting out a lot of steam...heats up fast...but I'm sending mine back 'cause the steam control dial does not stay where I set it--any li'l touch of my knuckles & bammo! you just moved it to a different setting w.o. even knowing you've done so! Very annoying. If that kinda thing doesn't bother you, then go for this iron as you get a lot for your $. I just tend to want tool settings to remain static unless I ""tell"" it to change. That's just me."
4,This is my wife's iron,This iron got a very good review in Consumers Report and my wife agrees. It arrived in a very short time in perfect condition.
4,Good iron for the price,"Good iron for the price. It heatup quicky, long power cable, and the digital display and alarm notification are very helpfull. Only thing is the cover for the water holding area it is a bit feeble, apart from this I would recommend this iron."
5,Quality,"My old iron just stopped working one day and I found this one, it had great reviews and much cheaper than my previos iron. I was surprised at how good it ironed my clothes and shipped by Amazon no 3rd party vendor. I recommend if you need a nice quality iron that gets the job done."
3,Didn't work but B&D is AWESOME!,"Received the item but once plugged in lasted about 3 minutes, shut off and would not work again. I think the either the seller or whomever they received this item had the same thing happen to them and, instead of just returning, sold it to us. HOWEVER, I called Black and Decker, explained the problem, told them it was purchased through Amazon and without question, gave me the information on how to return it for a brand new iron. Should be to us soon! I'll look to buy a B&D item just because of the awesome customer service."
3,Very heavy,"I decided to wait a few months before I wrote my review. First, the iron does an excellent job in pressing all types of fabrics. I was impressed with the amount of steam it delivers.Unfortunately, I found the iron to be very heavy with water in it. My wrist started getting sore after ironing for an hour. (I iron about 3 hours per week). Second, the water level is difficult to visualize due to the color of the tank. I found myself always checking it and double checking to see the amount of water in the tank. Third, the 'on & off' button gets stuck and the iron will not shut off when I want it to. I have to wait for the auto shut off or I just unplug it. (I'm usually running out the door after ironing).With all this in mind, I gave it only 3 stars."
1,Not a Happy Camper,"I've been using this iron for about 1 month. Beginning the second week that I had the iron, it started beeping LOUDLY and ALOT. Then it began turning itself off while I was using it. This week it's started sputtering out watering onto my clothing.Technical issues aside, I did enjoy the smoothness with which it glided, the large water tank and easy to read display. However, I didn't like the weight of the iron. For me it was a little too heavy.Unfortunately, I will be returning this iron. Perhaps I'll give digital irons another try after the bugs have been worked out."
1,Stopped working after 1 1/2 years.,"I thought I was being so conscientious to do my homework before buying another small appliance so that I would have something that would work for years. Well, it didn't work this time - started to iron a few days ago & then there was this burning smell. I unplugged it, but now it won't heat up at all. Dissappointing!!"
1,Spits Brown Water,"I am sick and tired of this iron. What are the pros? It does get hot. Cons? It spits water out all the time - no matter what heat setting, no matter what steam setting. And the water is brown and makes AWFUL stains on light/white clothes. According to the instructions, this is supposed to stop if you clean the iron. I have cleaned and re-cleaned the iron exactly accoring to Black and Decker instructions - all to no avail. From reading the customer reviews on Consumer Reports, I am not alone as this is a frequent complaint. The steam feature RUINS this iron."
3,Just ok,"I've had this iron for about two years. It works ok, but it doesn't get hot enough, even on the highest setting, to iron very-wrinkled cotton items. It also leaks when I use steam for more than a few minutes."
5,KDB Mom,"I have owned this iron since 2005. This is the greatest iron for any household. I received it as a Christmas gift from my father. He was in the search a iron at my request, although I was just expecting a plain old iron as a gift. I was pleasantly surprised when I received it and have been enjoying it ever since. I ordered another one just to have for guests that stay over night. You will not be disappointed."
5,Wonderful product !!,I have owned this product for more than a year now and have been using it very frequently. I haven't had any problems with it. The product is very lightweight and easy to use. I highly recommend it.
4,Great Value,"When my old iron finally gave out I purchased this Black and Decker iron. I never realized just how bad my old iron was until I used this iron. It gives out plenty of steam to iron clothes in a hurry. Light weight, I would recommend this iron to anyone purchasing a new one. I would have given it 5 stars if it held more water; however, I keep a water bottle filled and use that to refill when needed so not really any trouble."
5,Ironed clothes,Perfect. Light weight. A must have. The price is right. Great gift also. Everything is digital and simple to use.
2,Not in it for the long haul.,"I purchased this item in 10/2008 for $57.94 and loved it. The iron was wonderful and worked like a pro for the price. Alas, last month I found that it would not stay on when ironing the cord has loosened at the base and losing connection. I was all set to purchase the same iron but not for $199. The value was great at $57.94 even if I only got 2 years out of it but not at $199. Buyer beware."
3,Display is already bad,"I like the iron a lot, except for the fact that the display that shows the various settings has gone bad. I am going to contact the manufacturer and see if the iron can be replaced. On the bright side, the iron heats up quickly and the burst of steam is very strong."
4,Very capable iron!,"Consumer Reports Magazine rated this iron very high and I agree with their rating but the iron was somewhat hard for me to find and it is rather heavy, otherwise the iron performs very capably."
5,Great looking iron,"Have yet to use it, but I believe in the black and decker name, so when the time comes I shall iron many shirts, and I am sure I will be happy with the results."
4,Great so far,I rarely use the iron but so far its has worked great. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because I rarely use it.
4,Gift,This was a Christmas gift requested by one of the children. I have not heard how it works but have heard no complaints.
1,Iron,I bought this because of its high ratings. I have been sadly disappointed and am now ready to return my second one and ask for a credit.
4,so far so good - very pleased,"so far i love this iron. i've got no complaints. the steam feature works great. the iron itself works really well on all fabricsi'm only giving it 4 stars because i've had it for a month. and we all know with some product, it could be fantastic for 6 months, and then konk out on you, so we'll have to wait and see"
1,Stopped working the second time I used it,"I bought this iron as I needed a good strong iron for linens. It worked beautifully the first time. The second time, I turned it on, it went on for a few seconds then went completely dead. I had to jump through all kinds of hoops, but finally found someone at the number in the booklet to find out how to get it fixed, replaced, whatever (I have only had it a few weeks) They had me send the cord in and about three weeks, I got a new iron. I haven't tried it yet, as I had to purchase another iron while waiting for this one, as I cannot go without an iron for three weeks!"
1,Not working after 6 months.,"I purchased this iron after doing some research. It had good reviews and it did work well, but after about 6 months, it just stopped working. It lights up and looks like it is going to work, but it won't heat up. Unfortunately I lost the receipt, so there is nothing I can do but just eat the cost and buy another iron."
5,Great Iron.,I really like this iron. It does exactly what it says it will do. And does it well. I seldom use the steam surge button because it uses just the right amount for the fabric you are ironing. It is effortless and clothes look great. A friend told me to be sure to clean when you get that message to keep it working correctly. I highly reccommend this procuct.
4,"Great Iron, But made for a Lefty","I have used 2 Rowenta irons over the last 20 years, but I gave this a try on a Consumer's Best Buy. It's as every bit as good as both of my old Rowentas. I just have one issue, The Steam and Spray buttons are reversed, so it feels like it's made for a lefty."
1,Broke after 15 months,The iron was great while it lasted. Unfortunately that was only 18 months of ironing five shirts a week.I never take the time to write reviews but felt the need to warn others of a product that should be able to keep heating up much longer than 18 months it gave me. I love the fact that I could check my Amazon history and see that is was only 18 mnonths for a rather expensive iron at the time (It has come down in price since I bought it). Buyer beware I would never buy another Black & Decker iron again.
3,Iron,"It's o.k.They just don't make irons like they use to.I hate to iron but when I do, I want it to do a great job...."
4,One of the better better irons out there,Easy to use and operate. Some may feel that the water capacity could be larger but this depends alot on the amount of ironing one does and how much steam one uses. As long as it's properly maintained it should last awhile.
5,Black & Decker Digital Iron,"After checking out Consumer Reports, I purchased this iron. I'm a once a week ironer - usually for 2.5 to 3 hours. The water reservoir is twice the size of my previous iron and does a great job with steam release. Extra long cord makes it easier for me to set up the iron and ironing board in my favorite location (in front of my TV). Good weight, easy to control. It's the best iron I've ever owned."
2,Died after 14 months,"The heating element burned out after 14 months of minimal use, I would expect a product to last longer than 2 months after the warranty ran out."
4,Black & Decker Digital Advantage Iron,"We got this iron when our Rowenta iron failed after only 2 years of service. We got this one because it was highly rated by Consumer Reports. They were right! My wife loves this iron and says it's the best on she's ever used. The only negative is that it's a bit heavy, but that's easily offset by the fact that it irons very quickly and does a beautiful job. No more Rowenta's!!!"
2,My old steam iron was better,"When I bought the Black and Decker 2030 based on recommendations on this site, I was hoping that it would perform better than my 17 year old Norelco 725 steam iron which required that I spray the garment with water before ironing to get a good press. But when I compared the two (with the both on the highest steam setting), making a single slow pass over a linen shirt, the Norelco actually did better! The B&D burst of steam was impressive, but it wasn't enough to remove the wrinkles on its own. The B&D has its steam holes around the perimeter, leading me to try out the Rowenta DZ9080 which has them distributed more evenly. It has a larger plate and looks great. But using the same test, the Rowenta was the poorest performer. The Rowenta did have the best, finest, water spray. But like the B&D's, the Rowenta spray points straight ahead; you have to lift and tilt the iron down to spray the item, which then causes an unnecessary burst of steam."
5,"So Far, SO GOOD!","My B&D Classic iron (which I totally loved) died after 10 years -- on 12/25/2011 to be exact. A few days later, after doing some search, I decided to purchase the B&D Auto-Off Digital Advantage Iron. So far, I love it. It heats up pretty quickly, the steam is great and it has a nice weight to it. I hope it lasts just as long as my old iron."
1,Girlie-men need not apply.,"When the bimetallic cut-out on the base plate of the iron hasn't blown, this iron is hot-damn. It generates more steam than Mt Vesuvius and will easily place a crease in sheet metal.I got tired of re-filling the water reservoir four times during my usual long ironing session (cos I let the ironing pile up until I absolutely have to do it). Unfortunately it also has a nasty habit of deciding when it needs cleaning, regardless of what you are ironing. It beeps and immediately heats the base plate to a temperature approximating the surface of the sun, expecting you to stop (oh, too slow - a pity about that burned white shirt), put more water in it, and scald yourself cleaning it.Ah, no thanks - I decide when the iron needs cleaning, not the iron. Returned it for store credit. Probably be fine for occasional ironing and probably targeted at the hotel, motel market.Avoid."
1,Died after 18 months,"I expect an iron to last more than 18 months.As usual Iron performed great up until it died. However, I expect more.The last one died too. Doesn't anyone make anything that lasts more than a couple of years any more."
4,Great iron that died after only 3 years,"This is probably one of the best irons I've owned with some problems.1) The hole at the top drips water when the iron is 3/4 or more filled with water.2) The rubber plug one the top cover fell out at one time and water dripped out all the time until I was able to recover it while cleaning.3) The iron is heavy and metal coating is great, it does not stick to clothing.4) The power cord started acting up and the iron wouldn't turn on until I moved the prong around. Finally dying in a few months. It turns on but does not get hot.5) I took very good care of the iron and followed the manufacturers care instructions. It should have lasted over 3 years for the price paid.6) The iron gets hot very fast and was great while it lasted."
3,Bells and Whistles but Falls Short of Performance,This is the second Black and Decker iron we have owned and likely the last. B&D; is a good company but the iron heating surface on the D2030 didn't last more than 20 days and began to get a residue buildup that could not be removed. We believe it was from the spray starch. But if a base plate cannot be cleaned easily from spray starch then what good is the iron?All of the auto features worked as advertised but this is the first iron we have had where the base plate got a residue buildup that constantly interfered with the ironing process. Not sure what the metallurgy is but the results are what they are.
5,Great Iron For The Price,"After having two expensive Rowenta irons fail on me with cord and iron failure issues I tried this one. So far it works great. I do miss the extra steam holes the Rowentas had, but not the short lives."
1,Love the iron,The product is everything it is advertised to be. The iron does a great job on any type of clothing. I would recommend this product to anyone who likes their clothes to look pressed and neat.
1,Fire Hazard,Auto-Off feature does not work. Iron remains hot as long as plugged in. Seems very cheaply made; electronics probably have a high failure rate.
1,BIC Store Don't Order from Them - TERRIBLE SERVICE -Non-responsive,"I ordered this iron from Bic Store and they shipped the cheaper model because they didn't have the one I wanted in stock. I've sent 7 emails to them and they have not responded to my requests on returning this iron. If you need to return something to them, they do not respond in the 3 days that it states on Amazon. I would recommend buying irons directly from the store.Digital Advantage Iron Auto Off Steam With Spray, Surge And Stainless Steel Plate By Black & Decker [ Model D2030 ]"
1,Boo for B & D,"I have not used this B & D iron and, frankly, will NEVER used a B & D product because of their incredibly POOR Customer Service. As I have told B & D, if I had to buy a new iron every week for the rest of my life, none of them would be B & D."
4,as good as it's called...digital advantage,this item is a very efficient wrinkle remover for any fabric type.
4,reliable product,I liked this iron because it was reviewed in a major consumer mag as #1so I bought it here because Amazon had the best price.It does everything an iron is supposed to do and it does it very well.I am happy with my iron.The only reason it didn't get a 5 star is because my favorite iron is the Rowenta Perfect but it cost over $100 and that is too much to pay for an iron unless you are a professional seamstress or something.
1,Major Waste of Money,"I have bought many B&D irons but have bought my last! Twice I have spent over $50 for a Black and Decker iron that only lasted 6 months, they used to stand for quality, the service centers no longer support them either!"
5,Excellent iron!,"Having suffered through several irons which didn't get hot enough to get the wrinkles out and which sputtered water everywhere despite claims of no leakage, I researched and decided on the B&D D2030 iron, and what a great decision that was!! This bad boy heats up in a flash, steams when you want it and stays dry when you don't want steam or leaks, and it's great on even the hardest of wrinkles--exactly how an iron should be. I highly recommend this iron; it almost makes ironing fun!"
4,Good deal,I saw this iron on consumer reports and it works really well. It was an e en better deal bei g on amazon.
2,bought in '07 and it just broke,I went searching for a new iron today since my black and decker won't heat up any more. From Amazon I noticed I purchased it in 2007. I expect more than 2 years out of this product. It worked well but I decided to try one of the Tfal's. Will let you know in a few years if that one holds up!
2,Heavy!,"This is my first new iron in more than five years and the last one was a Black & Decker ""retro"" classic. It was simple and worked great for many years.This new one is very heavy and the handle appears to have been designed for someone whose hands are the size of your average giant. It doesn't get quite as hot as I like for ironing cotton but gets the job done, although it takes longer to iron a piece of fabric than it did with the old iron. I'm not crazy about the auto-off feature but can overlook it because this iron does heat right back up really quickly. Of course, I've only had it a month or so, and will be interested in long-term outcome. In the meantime, won't someone PLEASE make an iron for the people who probably use them the most --- women! Some of us are pretty darned small and would prefer to do our weight lifting at the gym, not at the ironing board."
4,Nice Iron,"This is my 3rd of these irons. I leave it on for hours at a time when I'm quilting. Sometimes it is only off for a few hours at night. My first one dropped after about 3 years, and broke. My fault. The second lasted 2 years. It still heats well, but it does leak when filled. I have yet to put water in my new one. I honestly believe that our hard water is to blame for the leaking. I could use bottled water, but with the length of time it is on, it would go through gallons per day. With the low cost of the iron, it is less expensive to just buy a new one every few years. I love this iron. It is smooth and easy. Not too heavy, but heavy enough. This far outshines the Rowenta I had."
1,Leaks Terribly,"The very first time used this iron I put water in it and within 5 minutes every last drop had leaked out the back. I had to put the shirt I was ironing back in the dryer because it was so wet. Maybe mine was just defective, but this was such a disaster that I will not try another Black & Decker iron."
2,Water leak on first use.,"The iron is pretty good as is, but it was leaking water on clothes while ironing on the first time we used it. We put it back in the box right after and send it back for a refund. No product should give you trouble on first use..."
4,Black & Decker D2030 Iron,"Very nice iron, large water well, smooth operation, accurate heat settings, slightly heavy. Overall a very good iron."
4,Great Steam!,"In the world of irons it's ALL about the steam. I just ordered this for my husband to do his work shirts with and he loves it. The large surface area and high steam output get it done quickly and the heat up time is less than 30 seconds, super fast. I think it's a little on the heavy side, especially when I am using it as a vertical steamer. The iron puts out steam at the very low levels as well as the high so this makes vertical steaming more delicate fabrics very easy and uber-fast. Love it and would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a higher end iron to make life easier!"
4,good iron,"good iron, can not find this or another iron like at the department stores. love the alarm to tell you when the iron is ready"
4,one draw back,"This is a great iron. As with most purchases I review Consumer Reports ratings and this was listed on it with high ratings. It's one of the best irons I ever had, which it's my third. The one draw back that it has is if there is water in the iron and it's put down on it's face while off, it will leak, my last iron didn't do this. At least it doesn't leak while it's on and I'm using the iron ... no water marks!"
1,digital screen problems,I bought this iron on January 2007 and today it quit working. I turned it on and the digital screen is stuck on the first setting (heat level 1). I unplugged it and plugged it back on and it still does not work. I expect an iron to last longer than a year and a half especially since I only use it twice a month to iron a handful of garments.
3,Digital display light failed. B&D replaced iron with cheap P18000 instead of comparable Digital iron,"I am VERY unhappy with the Black and Decker company. The D2030 I purchased was a nice iron but the light in the digital display failed right away. I called BD and was told to cut off plug & send $7.50 and mail to ACP in Bedford Hts., OH to receive a new D2030. Instead ACP shipped a cheap, non digital P18000. When I called ACP to complain that this P18000 is not a comparable iron, they tell me to mail the whole P18000 back to them (at my expense) and they will replace it with a D5000. I feel they have cheated me by sending the non-comparable P18000. I feel BD is not honoring their warranty."
4,iron,"So far, iron works fine with no problems. It will take some people a few minutes to learn how to use the digital settings, but after that things will be fine."
5,fabulous iron,"I LOVE evrything about this iron! My old Rowenta finally died and I was glad. This iron, however, is fabulous. It has a nice weight to it, not too heavy but I don't have to exert all my energy pressing down on it either. The cord is a good length also.The steam holes are not just at the top but placed around the sole plate for better steam ironing. PLUS, there is a control knob to adjust the amount of steam you want, PLUS, you can also give it a spritz of steam if needed. Adding water is also easy and has a nice little cover over the fill spout. It holds a lot of water.The digital readout is nice. Just push the button until you get the correct temp for what you are ironing. Ironing different types of fabric, the temp has been perfect for each one. It is supposed to tell me when I need to use the self clean feature and I can't wait. Everything else has been so great.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has to buy an iron. You can't beat the price."
5,Just ordered our second one!,This iron tackles the task of ironing a family-of-five's clothes. We just ordered our second one as my wife and I sometimes have to double-team the piles before they overtake us.
4,Solid and steamy,"Impressed so far! This is a hefty, but not too heavy iron. Heavy enough to avoid manually smashing an iron downward with thick fabric on the ironing board, but light enough so the iron moves with ease. The steam seems more than adequate, and the spray works just fine.If they'd save the money they're wasting on the TEENY pitcher, maybe they could incorporate an automatic cord wind on this baby and I'd give it 5 stars."
5,Best iron ever owned,"This was rated best bt CU when purchased and lives up to the rating. No problems, heats quickly and very easy to use."
4,Black & Decker D2030 Auto-Off Digital Advantage Iron,This is a nice heavy iron which is important. The heavier the iron the less you have to press down when ironing. Saves your muscles.
1,DISAPPOINTED!!!!!,"I recently purchased a new Black & Decker D2030 from Amazon to replace a rather old iron. Much to my dismay, the new iron leaks as badly as the old one. This product is definitely not worth the investment. Save your money and perhaps buy the cheapest iron you can find, since I haven't found one worth the money yet."
5,More Powerfull Than A Steaming Locomotive.,"So far so good, iron heats up fast and has the power of a steam locomotive. Love the push button control and that it shuts down when you forget. Price was right, the last rowena I bought did not last. This is a far better deal."
5,B & D Iron,"Great item at a great price. Works better than the $150.00 iron I had..at least this iron will stay hot long enough for me to iron a complete set of cloths, whgere the other iron would quit steaming and turn cold."
5,Patty,Best iron for lots of steam.Have had every kind even expensive ones that aren't as good as this Black & Decker.
4,Nice,Really good iron - I particularly like the iron base - it glides really well and no pressure required - I especially like that self cleaning button
4,A good easy to use iron,"i like the digital design of this iron. it will tell you exactly the right setting for specific fabric, no guess work. i used it several times and i feel confident i will not ruin my clothes when using this product."
4,"Great iron, good price","Bought this to replace an old walmart iron. Works great, good water storage size, and quickly heats up. Pretty heavy but makes ironing easier!!!"
5,The best is not always the most expensive,"This is a really good iron, according to my wife and daughter! We've had quite a few, and some were more expensive, many were less expensive, but none has been as good. A guest in our home recently wanted to touch up some of his clothes and remarked that our B & D iron was the ""Cadillac of irons."""
4,Best Iron I have ever used!,I am a person who dreads ironing every morning before work. I actually don't mind this task anymore since purchasing this iron. It has a nice LED readout showing the different settings for the type of material and it beeps when ready. It has a separate steam setting knob under the handle. The soleplate is just outstanding. It glides over my clothes and produces enough steam to get wrinkles out in a couple passes. It works wonders on my jeans. If you put the steam setting on high it will use a lot of water fast but that is to be expected. It is easy to fill and doesn't leak water out like cheaper irons. Hands down the best iron I have ever used. Black and Decker has hit a homerun with this one!
4,good basic iron,"Great iron for the $$. I like the different temperature settings and the automatic off switch. I can't see spending more than $40 on an iron, so this one is very satisfactory. I bought one for <$20, and returned it because it didn't iron well at all. Sometimes you get what you pay for."
3,Really good iron but...,"This iron does a really good job of ironing but it has a major design flaw. The cover over the water well breaks really easily. I had read reviews before I bought it where people stated they had the same issue. Like a dummy I figured they were just rough with it and was sure it wouldn't happen to mine. I was wrong. The third time I used it, although I was very careful, the piece that holds the cover shut broke off. I have to fill it and tape the cover down with masking tape. It's a real pain. And water still leaks out of the water well all over my clothes. You would think a company like Black & Decker could come up with something better than this. I'd be willing to pay more to have a better cover. 5 stars for ironing power and ease. 2 for design."
3,Not As Good,"I love to iron and a good iron is very important to me. I had been using the Rowenta for years until it died. After much research I went with the B&D.; I love the steam, BUT I don't like the fact the steam dial terns off by itself (this is my second B&D; in one month and the other one did the same thing). AND, after maybe 5-10 hours of ironing, it says it has to be cleaned again. THIS IS NOT GOOD!!!!! Can anyone out there recommenda good iron?"
5,Black & Decker D2030 Auto-Off Digital Advantage Iron,The iron is perfect. It gives professional amount of steam. This is what I wanted and I have not been disappointed.
3,works well but !!!!,"Iron works beautifully, except for one flaw.The dial right below the handle for thesteam control dosen't lock into setting placed and moves to the lower settings offten.I have to keep checking that dial is on higher setting because I mostlyuse iron for cotten clothing."
2,Not as good as Rowenta,"A bit heavy, does not glide smoothly. Heat is uneven and can get scorching hot. No automatic shutoff! The display indictaor is truly hard to read. A fairly low-end, K-Mart type product compared to the German made Rowenta. As a matter of fact, I bought a Rowenta three weeks later and use this as a backup. Not worth the money!"
4,Black & Decker D2030 Iron,"This product does an OK job or pressing. It doesn't get as hot (1200) as my old Rowenta; however, it does the same annoying thing--spit brown residue on my clothing. I live in Florida and I always seem to have a problem with irons..."
2,Loved it for first 6 months.....,"I loved this iron --but the relationship is definitely over. The iron was ideal for the first 6 months: steam that lasted forever and hot as it got --it never burned my clothes. Then, about two months ago, the little bugger started dribbling rust. What a mess... white blouse, beige shorts - all got the brown streak of death. Rust cleaner worked, but two or three days later, and its the same problem again. I am so disappointed -- I thought he was the one!After reading about the awful way some customers were treated by Black and Decker, (replacing junk with garbage -- that's their ""replacement policy"") I have decided to cut my losses and look for another brand of iron!I have learned that in reading reviews as a way of deciding whether to purchase an item - to give more weight to those reviews written after the reviewer has had the product for a substantial amount of time. Most relationships are great in the beginning..."
4,black & decker D2030 Auto-off advantage iron,"The iron isn't too heavy but it has enough weight to work well on cotton and linen. The steam feature works very well and the sole plate is a good size (perfect for my husband's dress shirts and my full length skirts.) It takes less time to finish if the sole plate is generously sized. I would recommend this to anyone who irons mostly cotton/linen. The other settings do a good job also. Just make sure to wait for the beep and ""ready"" signal when going from linen to something thinner and lighter."
2,"Too Heavy, Buttons Stick","I use an iron in making products for my home internet business ( I use it a lot, my Rowenta was starting to leak pretty badly, so, based on the good Amazon reviews.I bought one of these. It is much heavier then the Rowenta ( the specs say 2 lbs, I weighed it, it is over 3 lbs.), and the steam buttons stick. I am returning it tomorrow. Don't buy this iron if you need a good one."
5,Great Iron at Budget Price,"Bought this item after reading the reviews. It's even better than expected -- a nice weight with a non-Teflon, stainless sole plate; heats fast and digital display is easier to use than the old-fashioned dials; also puts out a nice jet of steam; solid appliance for a decent price; now, let's see if it stands the test of time."
5,"If you must iron, this is the one to have!","Great iron for a great price. I'm very happy with the quality of this product and would recommend it to friends and buy it again. I love that has an adequate water holder requiring fewer refills and that the settings are large and easy to read and especially that when full of water, it isn't too heavy to use. I considered replacing my old Rowenta with another when it went bad; but felt the savings in purchase price alone was worth taking a chance on the Black and Decker #D2030. I am very satisfied with my decision."
5,No More Rowenta!,This is probably the best iron that we have owned. We had a Rowenta that we paid about $100. We will keep it only if something happens to the B&D D2030. This iron is so easy to use. Hasn't stuck to or ruined any clothes. Now we wished that we had bought two! Anyone want to buy a used Rowenta?
5,Best ever Iron!,"This is the best steam iron. I have had other brands and they don't hold a candle to this Black & Decker. This iron has lots of steam and it glides over the garments. It heats up really, really fast too."
5,Black & Decker D2030 Auto-Off Digital Advantage Iron,I purchased this item based on Consumer Report's recommendation and am totally happy with it. It removes wrinkles in no time....
1,Garbage product - stay away,"This iron was fine until about 1 year after purchase, and used seldomly, the thermal fuse blew so it no longer heats. Well, no big deal I thought until I tried to find the part. It's not available and Black & Decker, of course, is no help at all. Everything I've ever owned by B&D (DeWalt - the worst, any else B&D, Delta and Price-Pfister not so bad, but not great)has been garbage. What's wrong with this country?...Too much money for lousy products. I won't buy another one."
2,Weighs Too Much,"When my Rowenta iron broke, I purchased this one based on Consumer Reports ratings, low price and Amazon reviews. This iron is very heavy (Black & Decker told me it weighs 4.5 lbs. without water), so full of water it is about 5 lbs. The handle is very large and hard to grip, the heel rest is huge and it leaked. You get what you pay for and I will now be purchasing another Rowenta that is lighter, has a smaller handle and doesn't leak. (NOTE: I purchased the B&D iron based on Amazon 5* reviews and later read the 1* reviews; in the future I will read both)."
5,VERY PLEASED!,I just LOVE this iron!!!!! I have been trying to find an iron I like. Great Seller and I received this item quickly!!!!
4,"Hot, powerful steaming iron","Purchased this iron after reading many reviews online. So far, so good. Iron gets very hot, great steaming power. I sometimes have some problems with dripping, but overall, am very happy with the iron."
4,Good Iron,"My old Black & Decker iron lasted 32 years and was a little smaller in size. I will be happy if this iron lasts half this long. I have an in the wall ironing center which can store the iron, and this iron is a little too wide to fit on the shelf. I was disappointed that I could not find a good iron that would fit in this cabinet. Just a half inch smaller in the width would allow it to fit. Despite this minor flaw, I am pleased with this iron. It heats up quickly and has produces lots of steam. The water reservoir is quite large and you can iron for quite a long time if you fill it up. However, if you fill it with a lot of water, it will become quite heavy to manage. The iron itself is not light, but I think that it's weight helps to get the wrinkles out quicker and cover more area."
5,GREAT IRON! GREAT QUALITY!!!,Purchased this iron and love it. Performs really well. Great quality. Maybe a bit on the heavier side but that is a good thing.
5,What a terrific iron!,"I've just received this iron, and I've never had such a handy gadget before. It heats up almost immediately, holds a steam blaster for tough wrinkles, glides effortlessly over any fabric, and shuts itself off if left unattended (ten minute time-out if it's vertical, one minute if it's lying on its faceplate). I would feel rather silly just describing how to use an iron, but this one does everything so well, from filling the reservoir to blast-cleaning the iron of deposits. I hate ironing, but this makes it almost fun."
4,Great Iron,I love this iron. A few great features are the alert when the iron is at the selected heat as well as the auto shut down. I do not spend as much time ironing since I bought it.
4,Great iron,I love this iron - it is heavier than others but is easy to use. The steam is easily customized and uses tap water instead of distilled water. I would like for it to heat a bit hotter on the highest setting - the only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating. It is the best iron on the market and I bought it because of Consumer Report's high recommendation.
5,"Great iron, this will last a while.","I purchased another one of these irons just to have on hand. I am very happy with the performance. This iron is not junk! It will last a long time. I have been using my first one for over 2 years. This iron does not leak, or spit rust. This is a great product for the money."
1,Broken ...,"After just over a year of good service, it broke today. Plug it in and nothing happens ... Thought that maybe I could unscrew the bottom and try and figure out what had gone wrong, but good ol' B&D; used some crazy types of screws that you can't find screwdrivers for ...So basically now it is an $80 door stop.Disappointed as I thought it would have lasted longer considering how expensive it was."
5,Better than top-of-the-line,"I am looking to replace this Black and Decker D2030 model with the same exact iron - my neighbor has had a Rowenta that broke, beeped all the time, and eventually broke only after about 6 months of use. The only reason I need to replace this one is because the clear cover where the water is stored has cracked, only allowing for a minimal amount of water to be stored at any time. The crack is either from 15 years of use, or it is user-created. I wouldn't buy anything else!"
2,on/off button,the on off light never turns off- called the company they said to turn the light off i need to unplug it every time---& that is inconvenient for where i have the iron located
1,worked well for a year,"Sorry, B&D;, I do not like things that stop working properly a month after the warranty runs out. My iron performed very well for 13 months...then it decided to stop steaming. I bought it 4/2008 & now it is useless on cotton dresses, etc...It will still surge of steam & I can self-clean it...so it makes little sense to me that it doesn't steam. I have not misused it or dropped it... So for my money, it is better to read the negative reviews when buying this kind of product. I trusted the good reviews & CReports writeup...I will say it has never leaked unless it needed cleaning...and it was quick to say Clean.I tried to send a message to B&D; customer service on their website, filled in the blanks & the forms & hit Send, but got a runtime error...twice. Thanks a lot, B&D.; I will buy a different brand next time.I have recommended this to a friend & I hope hers works longer than mine...I would not recommend this to anyone now."
4,Could've been a 5...,"I had to rate it a 4 even though its the best iron I've ever used, simply because of the fact that I had to go through 2 defective irons before I finally got a good one. The first one the heating element went out after 2 uses, and the second had a problem with the buttons and wouldn't stop ringing. Other than that, this iron is definetly a huge bang for your buck! My favorite iron so far..."
5,Terrific iron,"This is the best steam iron we've ever owned. We like it so much we bought another identical unit for our vacation home. Fast warm up, useful status indicator, seemingly effective self-cleaning. We bought the first one based upon a Consumer Reports review, and have not been disappointed."
4,Seems to be a good iron for the money,"Have had the iron for a month or so and am happy with it. I like the digital settings, it does get hot enough and has a good weight to the iron.Have had problems with irons lasting - a GE Digital and a couple of Rowenta's. Let's see if I am still happy with this one in a year."
4,Great Iron,I never thought an upscale iron could cut ironing time but this Black & Decker really does. The iron glides effortlessly over fabrics and busts wrinkles immediately.It has an easily viewed water level for steam and the steam output is great. Warm up time is quick and the digital display screen is easy to see and cuts down on scorching since you can also read the fabric type. I am very happy with this choice.
5,Great Iron,"We purchased this iron after the last one (which was expensive) was repeatedly dropped to the floor. Not wanting to spend as much money as the first we decided to try this one. It has, thus far, proven to be a wonderful iron. It heats up very quickly, the digital readout is nice, the auto shut-off is convenient as is the ability to shut it off without unplugging it... a feature not available on every auto-off iron. The amount of steam this baby puts it is also impressive. The only thing I do not like is the small amount of water it holds... a minor inconvenience. Also the speed with which you go through the water is due to the amount of steam it goes through (a feature that is adjustable). All in all, an excellent iron!!"
4,Good iron,"Thanks to the reviews here I purchased this iron to replace a Rowenta that had multiple problems. I love the digital display, now I always use the right setting for my clothes (with other irons I would just use whatever it was set at last time and sometimes that was way too hot). It also tells me when the self-cleaning feature needs to be used (the lack of cleaning may have been part of the problem with my previous iron, oops). I've had no problems with water leakage like I've had with other irons. So far this has been a great iron."
1,Didn't last more than 6 months!,This iron worked very well when it was brand new. However after moderate daily use (only 5 days of the week) for a little more than 6 months it has started to leak water from behind the ironing plate. It makes a strange crackling sound and drips water all over.Stay away from Black & Decker!
5,Best Iron I've ever owned,"I replaced my defunct Rowenta with this iron and could not be more pleased with the purchase after two months of use. The D2030's controls are very easy to understand and use and I like that the iron beeps when it reaches the correct temperature. Multiple fabric settings allow you to iron lightweight poly blends as easily as heavy denim and--my favorite feature--it steams on lower temperatures as well as higher ones. It puts out copious amounts of steam without spitting. The display tells you when it needs to be cleaned and it's simple to do so. It's a tad bit heavy but not uncomfortably so, and glides effortlessly over the fabric you're ironing and one pass over the fabric gets the job done. Makes ironing a quick and easy chore and I'd purchase this product again in a heartbeat. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that it lasts a long, long time!"
2,Pouring WATER,"This was a GREAT iron for about TWO months - now the water just pours out - I have a lot of linen items - and IF you don't already know it - water STAINS linen!I guess I'll continue to use it - but go back to the ""old fashioned"" way of ironing - using the dry setting then ""sprinkle"" with a fine mist as I go along!!!"
4,great iron,"I bought this iron because it was recommended by Consumer Reports.I had reservations because I had considered replacing my old Rowenta iron with another Rowenta. However, I've been very pleased with this B&D; iron. It has all the features of more expensive irons and I especially like the longer cord, digital read out and strong burst of steam. I'd give the iron 5 stars except that it's a little on the heavier side. Personally, I like that since it does more of the work for me, but those that like a lightweight iron may not."
4,Excellent Iron,"Black & Decker D2030 Auto-Off Digital Advantage IronExcellent product that works well, would recommend to all."
5,Great Iron,I have used my new iron several times now and it is wonderful. Delivers plenty of steam and just glides over clothes. I like it better so far than any I have had.
5,An A-OK iron!,"Well designed, user-friendly (Chinese, what else?) iron. At 1500W heats up quickly. Mirror polished stainless steel bottom. Very nice LCD temperature read-out. Does all as advertised. Steam / water functions very controllable. I'm taking it easy with the water filler door as others have alluded to it breaking. The subject water fill door hinge consists of a very thin plastic piece which does appear inadequate. Probably gets broken more easily as the plastic ages from (normal) heat. Got my fingers crossed on this issue. Shoulda' been constructed from cast metal(?)...that said....a good iron at a good price."
5,Excellent Iron!,This iron work wonderfully. I've had it for over a month now and I am extremely impressed with all its features.
5,The best iron I have ever owned ( and I'm over 50 and iron daily!),"My daughter in college needed an iron so I decided to give her mine and get a ""better"" one for home - even though the Black and Decker we owned was OK...went on Consumer Reports reviews recommendation and we can't be more satisfied! THANK YOU - both Consumer Report and Amazon for stocking it!"
5,Excellent price - performance ratio,"This iron is a lot better than my old one, which I had for about 10 years. Maybe there is something better out there, but what I like about the product is that it holds a lot of water and gets fairly heavy and the digital feature is easy to use. I would want the setting to stay, though, when I switch off the iron. So far that's the only minor downside to this product. But at that price I wouldn't complain!!!"
5,Phenomenal Iron!,"I purchased this iron to replace a lackluster Proctor and Silex iron that could hardly heat any fabrics. It is a very easy to use appliance with preprogrammed settings for each type of fabric and an easily adjustable steam knob. It is also comforting to have the iron turn off when not in use or after I forget to unplug it. As for ironing, what once took 10 passes with it's predecessor now only takes one. Highly recommended."
3,"Reliable, but a bit heavy","We've been using this for about a year. I like the available settings and it certainly does the job well. I particularly like the automated reminder to clean it. Once I found the instructions, cleaning was a breeze. My only beef is that this sucker is a bit heavy. And that's coming from a big guy who can swing a pick axe all day with no hassles."
3,;0),"This is a nice iron. I was excited about the LCD monitor with the different fabric settings. Once you turn it on and put on the setting of your choice, the iron does the rest and tells you when it is ready. Although for me the iron states that it is a 1500 watts iron sometimes I feel it could be hotter. Maybe it was just me but that could be better. Other than that I like it and find it useful."
5,good design,"I love to have a professional iron, and not as expensive as rowenta for example. Big numbers, easy to handle, beep to notified the heat, beep when automatically turns off, i used close to me when i am sewing, and i dont have to worry to turn it off."
2,Don't buy this iron,"I purchased this Black and Decker iron less than three years ago and have not used it extensively. This is the second one of this model I purchased and I should have learned a lesson from the first one when it suddenly stopped working. I assumed that was a fluke. Yesterday, in the middle of ironing a pair of pants, this one suddenly stopped - no noises, no overheating, no warning at all - it just stopped. This time I will do more research and pay a little more if necessary and get a more reliable iron."
5,awesome iron,"Love this iron. I do a lot of sewing so I like the longer period before it ""rests"". Nice feature is the ""blend"" setting. Would highly recommend this iron!"
4,Good iron,It works that is all I can say is only a iron but it works fine I will recommend it to anyone !!
4,generally excellent but one flaw so far,"Love the steam features and the ease of use, but wish the cover where the cord goes into the back of the iron were longer and stronger. Too often the cord winds up under the iron instead of behind it."
5,Best iron I have ever owned,"I saw this iron in Consumer Reports, who recommended it as the best iron. I have used it a few times and think it is the best iron I have ever owned. It is easy to use and tells you when you have reached the proper temperature for several types of material (cotton, blends, etc.). It also tells you when it needs to be cleaned."
5,Black & Decker Steam Iron Model 2030,I did research on purchasing a new iron and this iron was rated very high. I previously had an expensive Rowetta. This iron surpasses all of the features offered by Rowetta. I sew a lot and wish I would have purchased this iron years ago.
1,LOUSY and leaks,"I needed a replacement for my Rowenta Pro iron and a friend recommended this model. Having had experience with a prior Black & Decker iron that met my sledgehammer after 6 days, I should have known better.This model is no better. It leaks as did the other one. I don't know...maybe B&D; irons don't like me, and I don't care for them either. If you're attempting to iron an article that can be damaged by water, I would NOT trust a B&D; iron with it. These irons leak and spot too much. Seems they can't make a steam iron worth a darn.It's also too light. How do you all iron with these feather weight things? Why can't somebody make a nice, HEAVY iron again? If I have to put my weight on it, then the iron isn't doing its job.I gave this a 1 star only because I don't have an option for no or negative stars. I'm returning mine for another Rowenta."
1,Blew Up,"I bought this in the fall of 08. This Aug it quit. Every time we'd lose power to the house the LCD display would act kooky-extra digits, etc. and the iron wouldn't heat. It cleared up after unplugging it and letting it sit, but it finally decided to never wake up again yesterday.Keep away from digital technology and displays on household appliances where ever you can. They are delicate and susceptible to power outages, power spikes and dropping...and unless you put a surge arrestor on everything...including your stove and washer, you're going to fry the display and lose functionality of the appliance long before anything else goes wrong...disabling your appliance."
4,New Iron,"My trusty iron of 14 years finally said goodbye. This one is easy to fill and set heat, steams well and without the teflon face plate there is no worry about scratching."
4,A decent product,"The Black & Decker D2030 has shown itself to be the best iron we've owned. Lots of steam, supported by a large water reservoir.Why then only 4 stars? Because I am skeptical about a product produced by a company that can't answer a simple question about the design of their product. I inspected the iron on receipt and noted that only half the steam holes in the sole plate appear to be functional as they are the only ones that pass fully through the soleplate. I contacted the Black & Decker help line and asked ""How many functional steam holes is the D2030 designed to contain?"" Their response ... ""We don't have that information.""My concern re. the number of functional steam holes is to assure myself that the iron's steam function will work correctly.If they can't answer this question why should I believe they are capable of producing a quality item"
1,Started good,"I purchased this iron in May 2011 and it worked flawlessly...until today when it caught fire. I had been ironing for about 10 minutes on setting 2 when a long steady beep started sounding & smoke began pouring from the unit.I immediately unplugged it, took it outside and doused it with water. It took several minutes for the iron to stop sizzling and smoking. What amazes me is the Iron looks fine with the exception of the plate, which is warped.I contacted Amazon but was told I would need to contact Black & Decker; which I attempted but today is Sunday. I always unplug my iron when not in use- if I would not have been home..."
3,"Great iron, just way over hyped","over 1000 reviews for an iron is VERY suspicious but I decided to go for it anyway as I've used a similar if not the same iron in the past.It's a great iron with two minor but very irritating flaws:Iron beeps whenever you adjust the heat level or when it's ready. Completely unnecessary and will annoy anybody that irons on a frequent basis (essentially everyone)Every time you plug in the iron it forgets the last setting used so you will have to tap the level button numerous times to get to your most common preferred setting. This definitely magnifies my frustrations with the first complaint above. A suggestion for Black & Decker would be to either install a battery or to default the setting at Cotton, which is what the vast majority of people set it at.I would still recommend this iron but do keep in mind it is seriously over hyped."
5,Good buy,"I have used cheap irons my whole life just because I never thought it would make a difference. Boy was I wrong. This iron actually makes ironing more pleasant, not that I enjoy ironing. I still don't want to iron, but now it is bearable and almost enjoyable."
5,Great Iron,This is a great Iron. I've used it about 3 times a week for about four years. Excellent steam control and can be used to steam clothes very effectively in the vertical position using the push button. Heats up quickly and I appreciate the beep telling you it has reached it's programmed temperature. Sturdy and works well. I was careful with the water fill covering based on other reviews and had no problems.
2,"Leaky if using steam,pain to fill tank","I should have stuck to a new Rowena. This one leaks water on my clothes, even at high cotton temperatures. It is a pain to fill as you can't just poor the water on. It works. I was too lazy to return a cheap product. Buy something else if you want steam."
4,Great,I hate ironing...I really do but this iron takes the sting out of it for me. I find that this iron has made it a bit more pleasant. There is copious steam which helps to make the whole ordeal quicker..it holds quite a bit of water and just glides nicely over clothing. It heats up rather quickly too. Don't hesitate...great product.Thanks.
1,"Great iron, FIRE HAZARD","This is a great iron, hands down. It made ironing extremely easy.However, this morning, the unit overheated and caught on fire. What a mess. It was on level six, the cotton setting, and had plenty of water inside.This is the best iron I have ever had, but the shortest lived.I do not recommend this iron. If you do own it, do not walk away from it with the power on."
1,two months,"Just for a heads up. I purchased this iron in December, received it in January and it broke by March 1st. In order to get a replacement from Black and Decker I have to send them a check for 7.50. Since the item was only used for a few months (infrequently, I might add) I thought the new iron should be free of shipping charges."
4,"Good Iron , works great!","The only reason I have given it 4 stars is due to the following:1. Its a little heavy as compared with other similar irons - but on the flip side I have noticed that the weight has helped iron the clothes better2. You could control the flow of steam but on the lower settings also, the water is used up pretty fast.3. After each ironing session they suggest to turn the steam off before powering the iron off and turn steam on only after powering the iron on for the new session. I am not sure what it does to the iron if this is not done in this fashion but it is kind of cumbersome to do it every single time and would tend to forget this standard operating procedure :-)Apart from that the iron works pretty good and I am happy and would recoomend you to buy it.Cheers."
5,"JUST AS THE OTHER FOLKS ARE SAYING, THIS IRON IS THE BEST","I'll make it short and sweet so as to not reiterate other folks' comments. I iron just about everything and have been through several irons, incuding a Rowenta. This 2030 is the best iron I have ever used in every single way. Better steam, better heat, better soleplate, better ergonomics, etc... and it is not expensive at all. What else can I say?"
3,Great iron ruined by a design flaw,"Like others I loved this iron, but then cover on the water intake broke and now it is no better then average. The cover is very very delicate. Once it is broken water leaks out and the iron spots like crazy. I have to tape the cover down and it still leaks. It took no more than three or four uses to break the latch on the cover. It is very sad that an otherwise great products would have this severe a design flaw."
5,I LOVE - LOVE - LOVE IT!,"This is without a doubt the best flat iron I have ever used! Maybe a little heavy but it has great steam, holds quite a bit of water and the temperature control is wonderful. You can switch from cotton to silk with the push of a button. It will tell you when it has reached the proper temperature. No more scorched clothes! I Love it!"
4,awesome deal,"love this iron, it's light and powerful. Consumer report flagged it as a good deal and they were absolutely correct."
5,good iron,My clothes are not wrinkly anymore. I enjoy the digital display and the solidness of this iron.
4,Great iron and very affordable,This is a great iron that has many bells and whistles without a big price tag. I do not iron very often; so I did not need the fanciest iron on the market. The B&D2030 is easy to use and cut my ironing time down (I was using a very old iron)- it provides plenty of steam to get out the tough wrinkles. Very pleased!
5,B&D D2030 Steam Iron,"Performs very well. No complaints. Easy to use, does good job, excellent steam function. Recommend highly."
4,A Good Iron,This iron is easy to use. I like the amount of steam it has and the 7 heat levels. I wish it didn't always revert back to 1 when going off.
5,Wonderful Iron,"This is a wonderful iron. My husband and I purchased one for my mom at Christmas and also got one for us. I have been using it for the past week, and it cannot compare to my past irons. I iron everyday and so far, this iron has not given me any reason to complain. I was worried about the weight, but it was comparable to my smaller iron. The price is great, and the steam feature, ready beep and smooth glide of this iron on heavy fabric like denim, make it a GREAT value!"
5,Great Iron!!,"I bought two of these based upon the reviews that I read online and I was pleased when these irons met my expectations! They are GREAT! They heat up fast. They can generate a lot of steam in order to get out the tough wrinkles. They have a large tank so that you're not filling it up all the time and they don't leak! As far as weight, they are heavier than the lightweight irons but I have not had any complaints about it from anyone who has used them. My Mother-in-law who used it says that it was much better than her $100+ Rowenta. Overall, I'm very please with these irons."
1,Return it after using once,"This is probably the worse iron. The stainless steel plate scorch after using just on one shirt. The steam is just ""ok"". I returned it and bought Rowenta 8080. The quality is not there on this iron."
4,Very Nice,Using this from last 2 months and i liked the design as the performance. Very easy to Use. Surely you can go for it.
4,Black and Decker Iron,This is one of the best irons I have ever owned. I had a Rowenta before this one and I ended up donating it to Goodwill. I hated that iron. It was overrated. This iron is so easy to use with the digital readouts for selecting fabric types. I highly recommend this iron.
2,It rusted,It rusted out after about 6 months. It worked really well in the interim. Pretty pricey to konk out so soon.
1,stinks!,I will be sending it back already! It won't change settings and is stuck on level 5. What a waste!!
4,Good Iron but one Design Flaw,"This is a good iron but it has one annoying design flaw. Whilst ironing, imperceptible movements will rotate the circular knob that controls steam output - you'll be halfway through ironing a shirt when you stop and wonder why no more steam is coming out. If you're like me, you want max steam coming out at all times, and you'll be constantly having to check that the knob hasn't moved. It's annoying.Otherwise this iron would've got 5-stars.Other reviews talk about how much steam this thing puts out - for me, it puts out enough but I've had other irons (Sunbeams) that put out more."
5,Using this iron for 10 months!,"I bought this iron from Amazon 10 months ago and it is still going strong. I love it. I have not had any problems with the lid to the water reserve but I am very careful with it because of the reviews I read on Amazon about it breaking. I am a huge fan of Rowenta irons. I have owned two Rowenta but we are rather hard on irons in my house. Besides being used daily they get dropped often. Buying a new $100 plus iron gets painful so I went shopping for acceptable and less expensive. This fits the bill. Nice steam, heats up quickly, shuts off on its own...I miss my old iron but not the price! I am back to buy a second one...nuff said."
3,"Worked fine, then broke!","This iron was the top choice by Consumer Reports. It worked just fine the first time. The second time it would not heat. Then it started making a continuous beep. Black & Decker sent a replacement, a less expensive model and I had to pay for shipping. So I lost $20 bucks or more but the non-digital replacement works fine."
1,Broke completely in 5 months and Black & Decker would not honor warranty,"The iron broke completely in 5 months and Black & Decker would not honor the product warranty to fix it. We received the iron in July 2012 and used it for less than 6 months before it stopped heating. My husband is trained as an electrician and we are tech savvy - this is not ""user error."" The digital display works fine but the heating element quit completely. When I contacted Black & Decker warranty, I was told that because I am out of the country, they would not honor the warranty. I work at the U.S. Embassy in Haiti and have a U.S. DPO address, which is where the iron was shipped. The iron has only been used in one house in U.S. Embassy housing, built to U.S. electrical code standards. I am out of luck with a broken iron. I do not recommend this model of iron to anyone as it lasted only 5 months before breaking, and I do not recommend Black & Decker because of their poor customer service and warranty coverage."
1,Overheated and was smoking,"Purchased the iron on 12/6/2011 and one month later my wife said smoke was coming out of the iron and it started beeping. It left on burn mark on the pant she was ironing. I guess it was overheating inside or something, I believe I read in the reviews that some other people had the same problem with their irons. Will be returning the iron back to Amazon."
5,One Bad Ass Iron,"My old iron was seeing its final days as the power cord was malfunctioning. I have never bought an iron for myself before and thought this was the appropriate time. The Black and Decker D2030 seemed like a good one so I went ahead and made the purchase. Upon taking it out of the box I was surprised at the weight and how awesome it looked. I was excited to use it and went ahead and began ironing some clothes that were in my clean clothes laundry basket. This thing did a heck of a job, heated up quick, steam settings are great and this thing is simply one BAD ASS IRON. I was so excited that I had to text my buddies and let them know that I had the baddest iron on the planet. Sadly at 25 I am feeling old that something like this excites me. None the less, if you do a lot of ironing you want this thing."
2,B&D Iron,The iron had a good feel in my hand and the temperature selections were good. I had one issue and decided to return the iron because it leaked too much water when it was in steam mode.
2,Circuit board will die after a few years,Mr. Colombo here. Iron is great while it works. I've owned two over the past several years. However at some point the circuit board will die and you'll have to get a new one. Another reviewer said that their iron emitted a long beep then started to smell like it was burning. Mine did the same exact thing. I'm off to try another brand to see if it lasts longer than a couple of years.
4,"flawed, but still beats the rest.","After using this iron at my uncle's home, I bought it when the iron I was using up to that point gave out. I had this for years and it's by far the best I've used. Recently, the wire that connects from the iron to the plug was going in and out; basically I had to fidget with it to get the iron to stay on. That got old so I decided I would look for other options. I tried a variety of irons (Rowentas, other Black & Deckers, etc.) but returned them all. And now I'm back on Amazon and just purchased the same iron even though the wire wore out on me. (And I guess others have mentioned that the water well cover is flimsy). Despite the flaws however, this iron still beats the many others I tried. I can't seem to find one that's more efficient and effective."
2,Orangeonion shipping is bad,I was very upset receiving this product from Orange Onion. I have never complained about shipping after all the products thru all the years. The outer box was fine. The iron box was dented all up. No one would have bought this at a store. I contacted Orange Onion as Amazon requested. They said to contact them if it didn't work and only said they would be happy to help me.It was a meaningless email reply. I looked up their refund policy. I would get a partial refund and stocking fee if the box was opened and returned after 15 days. You would have to return the box unopened within 5 days of shipping.I am very upset. It arrived on time and was a good price. But who cares. I would rate it 1 star if I could find the shipping comments.
1,Leakey Leakerson,"Bad. F. 100% F A I L.Leaked right outta the box.Fill it with a little bit of distilled water. Walk away. Sneak back into the room. Glance at it. It'll leak.Bad.Bad.B A D.F.Fail.I read reviews, considered expert ratings, conceded to paying a ""bit more"" , and this is what I got.Bleh."
1,not good,Based on Amazon review i brought the steam iron but it is not goodas suppose to be. It took very long time to iron the shirts andpant. so i return back the product to Amazon.
3,Not durable,"I got the predecessor iron, the Black & Decker D2020 in 2008. It worked great for a few years, but early 2011, it went kaputt. I'm not 100% sure what happened, but it was never dropped, never abused and still doesn't turn on anymore. Makes me question the reliability of this model unless there was some major change between the different iteration."
5,great iron,"Works as well as the Rowenta I was replacing at half the cost. 7 settings, smooth glide heats up fast."
2,Not MY Iron!,"I don't know what all these other reviewers are talking about! I bought a model D2030 last winter. Within a short period of time it began spitting and leaking. After several months, and two complaints to Black and Decker Customer Service, they had me return the iron and sent me a new one. After a short period of time the second iron started spitting and leaking as well. The two irons I had prior to the B&D's also leaked. The only iron I have that doesn't leak is my little 30 year old travel iron! I'm beginning to think that an iron that doesn't leak or spit doesn't exist."
5,the best iron yet!,"I purchased this item from consumer reports recomendation and they were right on the money. I Iron every day and have found a fabulous working iron with this Black & Decker. The product was shipped on time and works like a dream, you'll never buy another Iron again..."
4,Only one complaint,"I bought the iron last month and so far, I think it's great with only one exception: There is a dial around the inside of the neck of the iron that allows you to adjust the volume of steam you would like to use. I find that as I am ironing, my thumb tends to inadvertantly rub up against the dial and in most cases turns off the steam entirely and I repeatedly have to turn it back on. Not really a big deal but it can be kind of annoying. Otherwise, great product."
3,Works great except for one thing,"I think this iron works like most irons should - it is light and smooth. There is not much else, however, I do like that even if it has water in it, I can turn off the steam so I do not steam clothes I don't want to. But The thing I do not like is that it does not have an off switch. I have to unplug it every time. IF the plug is at an inconvenient place, it starts to become a hassle."
5,Very pleased with this iron,"I love the feature that allows you to dial the amount of steam. I find that when I dial it up, I don't need to keep pushing the burst of steam feature. The iron is comfortable to hold and use. I like a hot iron, and this is one. I like the digital temperatures and the capacity of the water holder."
5,"Good Weight, Great Iron",It comes with a large convenient measuring cup for the water that goes right into the iron without spillage. The ease of using it as well as the steam ability is terrific. I would recommend it to all.
5,Great Iron,"What I like about this iron: large water reservoir, plenty of steam, good choice of heat settings, doesn't leak, smooth ironing surface, easy to use, light weight, long cord."
5,The ironing power of a Rowenta for less than half the price,"I bought this to replace a $125 Rowenta iron after Rowenta told me that my iron was over one year old and therefore not under warranty. I had explained that the problem with the iron was a defect and not a warranty repair. The cord holder where the iron rests had become split, thereby burning the user if he or she touched the cord while using the iron.Back to the Black and Decker. I figured I'd miss all the steam the Rowenta put out, but I have to admit that my shirts look just as good with the Black and Decker. It heats up more quickly and has a much more intelligent filler hole, as well, so you won't be spilling water all over the ironing board all the time.Is it the best iron around? Who knows? It's certainly better than a much more expensive (and overrated) one that I have owned."
2,Worked for 2 Months,"This is a decent iron - except after 2 months of light use, it no longer heats. The return process is awkward, and you have to pay the return shipping fee (7.50) plus outbound, and wait 10 days. So, it's only marginally worth returning.I'm adding a star. About four weeks after posting the review above, a new iron arrived in the mail. I have no idea whether the review was the motivator, but I never actually returned the old iron. As I mentioned, too much trouble. Anyway, Black and Decker came through."
5,very good iron,"this was an outstanding value, an iron whose lack of frills is only topically offset by the digital display. lots of steam, easy to use, very effective at pressing, high-quality stainless base plate, minimal dripping. admittedly this is my first upgrade from cheapo pharmacy-bought irons but the performance has been flawless and i'd buy this again in a second. good for all fabrics, business or casual. unless you want to pay 3x as much or more for a renowned ""irons only"" brand there is no reason to overlook this item."
5,Black & Decker Digital Advantage Iron,"I'm not sorry I purchased this iron. Granted, it is a little heavy, but it sure does the job. After a few times ironing with it, the weight is unnoticeable. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new iron."
4,"Good buy, but does have its flaws","After working with a sub-par iron for my whole life, I decided to upgrade and look for a higher end model. The Black & Decker Digital Advantage was highly recommended from Amazon users so I purchased one. It's much heavier than I expected, but it does iron extraordinarily well. It heats up quickly (and lowers quickly). Unfortunately, even on the first try, the iron did start leaking a little bit...It does have a useful beep when the iron is ready for different settings and it's easy to fill. The heat is a little intense so it does dry out my hands (I've never had that happen before).Overall, this is the best iron for it's price range and features."
5,Love it.,I iron dress shirts for my husband to wear every day. I love how fast the iron heats up and the constant heat it keeps. I'm glad I bought it!
5,The best iron I have ever owned,"I purchased this iron about one month ago and I adore it. Mind you, I hate ironing. But I look forward to using this iron. It heats up like lightning and politely beeps to inform me when it has reached the desired temperature. It produces vast quantities of steam, enabling me to zip through any task in no time. Of course, this means you go through more distilled water and have to fill the iron fairly often. I can live with this, however. The only thing I would change is to have the iron 'remember' the previous temperature setting. But that's a minor thing."
5,love it!,"Great iron. It's a bit on the heavy side, but who doesn't need a one toned arm? :) Easy digital display and heats up fast."
4,steam button a little awkward,"I have to say this is a great iron for the money. The only thing I do not like about the iron is the button to push for a burst of steam is to the right, and the spray of water is on the left. I guess I use the burst of steam more than I thought I did... so when you are ironing if you want to push for steam it is a little strange to move your thum way over to the right. I am sure I will get use to it:) Every other iron I had the burst of steam was to the left... All in all a great iron. Well worth the 30 bucks!!"
2,Beware the handle rubber,"I've owned a similar iron a year or so. I iron rarely, only when sewing. My fella does more -- his shirts, still occasionally. I've begun using it on a quilt and noticed that the rubber on the top gray portion is peeling away. Alas, I like to keep stuff running a long time (I drive a '92 in great condition.) so am not happy to see the eminent demise of the iron. I'd be glad to send B&D a pic, but there is no 'customer service' on their web site, so B&D: you invited this posting. It has begun sounding its alarm at inappropriate times (when it's resting and off), which may mean that something's bakin' inside as well. Finally, there is no linen setting on mine. I wouldn't choose this iron. Ideas for another, anyone?"
1,Dud!,I was really excited to get this iron because it was supposed to replace a 5 year old Sunbeam. Anyways it worked for 1 day then would not get hot again. I wanted it to work so bad because I needed to look sharp for a new client. Nothing against B&D I'm just reporting what happend to me. I will try another brand.
5,Perfect for me and my family!,"Super slick sole-plate glides iron easily. Large water reservoir keeps refilling to a minimum. Temperature and steam controls are easily adjusted. I love how fast it heats up and it produces a lot of steam. After using this, I don't want no other iron. It never stained or scratched, and nothing ever stuck to it or built up on it. It just glided over all materials. perfect!"
5,Exceeds expectations,"Purchased iron online based on other reviews and price. Excellent iron, provides plenty of steam and glides easily over clothing. water reservoir is easy to fill and has a large capacity."
2,Works well while it works,"This is a good iron except for one major problem, it doesn't last very long. I bought this iron in January of 2008 and this morning it died, meaning it lasted only 16 months! We have owned several B&D irons and none of them lasted more than two years."
2,It broke in 3 months,This was a great iron. Loved the self clean feature and I loved the digital temp set and the fact that it beeped to let you know it was ready. However after 3 months the iron didn't heat up anymore. The power was still on but no heat. Amazon agreed to take back the iron and issue me a credit with 0 issues. I'm not going to rebuy this iron considering the last iron I bought lasted for 6 years and I only got rid of it because the retractable cord wouldn't stay out.
4,Great Iron - mostly.,"This iron is wonderful. Smooth, easy to use, and does a fabulous job on my clothes. My only complaint is that the steam dial is located where I often accidentally turn it with my finger when I'm ironing. Not a deal breaker but it would have been better put somewhere else. I would buy this one again because it is that good."
5,Best Iron Ever!,So far this is the best iron I have ever owned.Heats up quickly. Love the different settings.Water reservoir is great...easy to view contents.Cuts our ironing time by 75%. Totally superior to Rowentasthat I have owned over the years. It was delivered quickly.Glad that I ordered it.Amazon.com continues to provide excellent service.
1,What an ordeal!,"Buying this iron was a huge mistake! I took it back after two days because it wouldn't stay at the temperature I set it at. I had to reset the temperature at least 8 times while trying to iron one shirt! It kept flipping from where I set it (at level 6, cotton, with steam) to level 1. Besides that, the shape was a little unwieldy, maybe a bit too wide, making it more difficult than usual to iron long sleeves. It seemed to produce a lot of steam but the water reservoir had to be refilled before I could even finish one shirt. If I accidentally ironed a crease into a shirt where I shouldn't have, it was hard to get it out. After returning it, I bought a TFal Ultraglide Easy Cord and I couldn't be happier (unless someone else was doing the ironing.) The TFal, incidentally, is about $15 less than this B&D, too. For more info on the TFal, please see my review."
5,This iron made my Mother-In-Law happy!!,"My Mother-In-Law tried Rowenta and hated it. This iron made her happy, she loves it."
5,Another Biotene Must-Have,"If you must spray, it's gotta stay (in place). And, it does without your hair feeling like a helmet! It has made a fantastic and highly noticeable difference in my hair. Remarkable, regardless of weather conditions-- rain, fog, humidity. Excellent seller. Fast delivery. Worth every cent spent. Will buy again and again, for sure."
4,Little advanced,"I bought this as a present for my 12 year old daughter. It seems a little advanced for her but seems to be a very nice telescope, after we figure it out."
2,Stability issues,"The telescope itself seems OK. However, the tripod and mounting are very unstable, such that the telescope shakes with the slightest touch, including putting eye to eyepiece or a slight breeze. This instability makes precision pointing and stable viewing nearly impossible; point sources like stars bounce around the field of view and extended sources like the moon jitter significantly.The red dot spotting scope takes quite a bit to align and seems to need repeated re-alignment. The lighted azimuth and elevation dials seem more gimicky than practical.Got this as a company recognition award, so I'm not out any money, otherwise I would be quite unhappy. As it is, it makes a nice accent piece in the living room; as a telescope for stargazing, not so much."
4,A good start,"""Couch Potato Kids"" is a good start for parents who want to take a more active role in their children's lives. It, however, does not go into enough depth on resources for parents such as Turn Off the TV dot-com, home school/parenting assocations and other resources for parents trying to find alternatives to the influence of television."
1,"Rough sketch, but no portrait","Home Lands is an interesting collection of vignettes of Jewish communities and families. But this book is thin in its assertion that a new, strong Judiasm is unfolding across the world. Tye uses very few communities to illustrate his point, and ultimately, the book becomes contrived. Because the stories themselves were not groundbreaking enough or entertaining enough to stand on their own, Tye tries desperately to sew them together with his thesis, which might be interesting if one could believe that a handful of communities represent all the world's Jews. To be frank, this book is dwarfed by a multitude of books on the subject that are backed by much more research."
5,It's like my cat's two favorite toys combined.,"Milk Bottle Rings + Jingle Balls = Colorful SpringsMy cat loves those stupid plastic things from the tops of milk bottles since he can pick it up with his teeth and carry it around and toss it. He loves batting balls around because they keep moving even when he's not touching it.These do the best parts of both, plus they sometimes spring in a random direction when he's gnawing on one so he is one happy cat."
2,Cat Toy,These springs are metal not plastic as they appear to be.Sharp pointed ends could easily injure your cat should they bite on it. I sent them right back.
4,Good cat fun and good value,The cat liked to play with these and the package was a really good value. I highly recommend this product!
2,Did not work for my cat,"Sadly, my cat did not like it at all. I do not know why... All the reviews lookes so promising but it was just not for my cat."
2,"maybe, maybe not","My cats don't like these, but maybe yours will? It's hard to say. I think it depends very much on your cat.The toys are as described and came in a colorful mix. They bounce around and your cat can chase them if so inclined.I thought for sure mine would enjoy playing with them because they like to bat things like bottle caps, straws and other little things when they can get a hold of them.As the other reviewers said, the toys do have a tendency to end up under the couch. But for mine, it didn't really matter. They played with these toys for a few minutes, but then that was it.If your cat does like them, I'd say they are a great value for the money."
5,Our cats LOVE these springs,"I don't know why these Colorful Springs cat toys aren't in pet stores everywhere. I found them on Amazon by accident when searching for accessories for cats, and our kitties have loved them ever since. One of our cats especially will literally play with one spring for hours at a time, only stopping if she manages to lose it under a piece of furniture high enough for the spring to go under. The springs don't go under the doors and get lost or stuck like most other cat toys, so they play with the springs longer. We get a huge kick out of watching them attack, roll over with the springs and bound around the house with springs skittering across the terazzo floor. I'm glad these are very durable toys for our kitties, since we've never seen them sold in stores around our area. They keep pulling the toy mice, feathers and string-held toys apart, but the springs are good as new. Try these springs out - your kitties will thank you!"
2,My cats don't care about these at all,"The product itself is fine. I'm sure some cats go crazy over these but mine couldn't care less. The springs bounce when you throw them and they roll easily along carpet and wood but my cats just stare at them and don't even try to catch them. Maybe if you attached some feathers to the spring or something, they'd be more fun...dunno. I'd suggest buying ""Da Bird"" instead. That toy works."
1,Painted Steel Springs,"Audio Haus sent me the painted steel springs as well. I didn't read enough of the reviews to realize this may be a vendor specific concern. I called Ethical and they are apparently aware and when I called Amazon to return the product their policy was excellent. Overall I'd've been happier if I received the wide plastic springs I was hoping for, but at least the process to resolve the issue was painless. Thanks Amazon!"
5,Relieved Cat Owner,"When we adopted our yearling cat, we had a few springs like these around from a cat we'd had previously. Our first cat had loved this toy; our new cat, however, is fixated on them. That is all she will play with, and she does so for hours on end. But as others have mentioned, these springs have a tendency to get lost (at least temporarily). I was in fear of running out; I didn't know what my cat would do for entertainment then! I couldn't find them locally, so was very relieved to find them online--and I ordered a bunch of them. The order was placed mid-week and was delivered on Saturday of the same week. I highly recommend them for any cat owner; where else can you find a toy that provides virtually unending entertainment for your cat for under $3?"
2,My cats don't really understand these ... and neither do I,"I thought that my cats would love these because they love little things they can pick up in their mouths and carry around with them. They love cat crazies, milk caps, and empty rolls of scotch tape. I thought that these would be plastic and 'springy' but they are metal with a plastic coating. They don't spring back to life ... they just kind of conform like a pipe cleaner. One of my cats put it in his mouth and chewed one flat."
2,Meh.,"My 4 cats are not interested in these at all. They were intrigued when I first brought them home for about 5 minutes, but after that, they've been collecting cathair-bunnies in the corner since."
1,Cat doesn't like these at all -- overpriced product,"My cat doesn't like these at all. He doesn't bat at them when they're on the floor, and when I try to pinch and fire them across the floor, they just flop down on the ground -- not enough tension in the spring. I tried tying them to string and dragging them around, but the cat just stares at them. Overall, a cheap, flimsy toy that is way overpriced."
3,Where will it be next?,"While I see our cats play with them now and then, I find them in different parts of the house, which means that somebody is playing with them, and I don't think it's my husband"
1,Be sure your cats will love them before you buy...,"My three cats absolutely ignore them. Even my super happy cat ""Batman"" (he is like a child with ADD and hiperactive) hates it. I rolled them, bounced them stood them on end. I got them because so many people said their cats love them, but mine...well;-/. I'll give them to my dad who has two cats."
5,Good excercise for kitty,"These were smaller than I expected, but my two cats love them. They soccer them around the house and carry them proudly in their mouth when caught. Great bang for the inexpensive buck."
5,Cats Love These!,"When I got my bengal cats, the breeder gave me some of these. The kittens loved them but they got lost and I could not find them anywhere. THANKS AMAZON!"
3,"Well made, cats are so-so about them",My cats will play with these when they come across them but do not seek them out or beg for them the way they do fur mice or real milk tabs! Springs are well made though and a fair price for the amount you get. Fine to have around on the floor for when they ARE in the mood to bat and carry them around.
5,Kitty is nuts for these,My cat loses his $h1t for these springs. He'll play fetch with them until my arm doesn't work anymore. I highly recommend them to cat owners.
4,kitties,gift for animal shelter dog and cats that don't have a forever home yet - wanted to bring some joy to their lives since I can't adopt them all.
4,Good Toy BUT...,"My cat loves to play with these springs, but I've had to cut and file down the ends. Some of the ends are very sharp and poke her in the face/mouth when she carries them around. Also, they squish (of course) when they are stepped on and don't work as well (haha)...I guess we need to watch where we're stepping! All-in-all a pretty good cat toy!"
1,Tell me a good use for these.,What was the point of these again? I bought them off the reviews and because they were cheap. My kitten is having more fun playing with a pen.
3,Better with hardwood floors?,"I don't recommend these if you're in a mostly carpeted home. I could just as well be throwing a beer can as far as our two cats are concerned. They'll take a crumply paper ball over these any time.Quality wise, they're just fine. I've stepped on them repeatedly- slammed them in doors-- whatever and all they've done is stretched or bent a bit."
2,"Cats love 'em, but not safe","I have 9 cats total (some mine, some fosters) and most of them just LOVE these toys. That said, I have found them chewed into pieces! Both the cats and a puppy. I have sweated bullets worrying that those sharp plastic pieces wouldn't cause a perforated intestine! While they are great fun, they should be used only when closely supervised so you can take them away when the cats start eating them... or risk losing your pet (or at least a very expensive surgery!)"
1,6 foster kittens and 3 adult cats - zero interest,"I am currently fostering 6 foster kittens who I thought would play with anything... I have watched them play with scrap of paper the size of a quarter like it was the best toy ever invented. These springs... they are totally disinterested. How is that even possible? I roll them across the floor and they look at them, then at me. Same for the adult cats who's batting-across-the-floor toy of choice is cut up plastic flexi straws. One sniffed one when I rolled it into her paw, and that was it. Zero interest. I didn't want to leave them out after reading the comments about kittens ingesting them, and also I'm afraid I might hurt myself if I stepped on one with bare feet, as where the coil ends are open so rather pointed. Back to rolled up balls of paper and fabric mice!"
3,Comes Apart,"My 6 month old kitten enjoys playing with this toy. However, the toys come apart and become a set of toys of single cylinders. He still plays with them but not as often or for as long."
3,Hit or Miss,"I didn't want to imbalance the ratings too much, as it does the job when necessary, so I gave it 3 stars instead of 1. However, my cat doesn't like these toys much, he'll hit it and chase it for like 5 seconds and gets bored really quickly. I'll grab them and throw them around and he just stares them bouncing and doesn't do anything.My cat prefers to play with toys that have a long string or feathers on them. He'll go crazy chasing and batting a feathered toy. But unless I force this spring on him, he'll usually ignore it. BTW, this toy just looks like a colored version of large spiral bound notebooks. If you have one of those that you don't use, cut it up and test it on your cat to see if he'll like it. It'll go under some furniture all the time, so if he likes it order this thing! =)So most of the cats seem to like this toy (as the reviews show) but if your cat doesn't like anything without a long ""tail"" then they might not be interested."
4,Cats liked this toy,"These are just little pieces of plastic, so it kills me that it cost $5 for 10 (should have been cheaper), but the cats do like batting them around and playing with them. I have found them all over the house."
5,This is my cat's favorite toy,"When I first purchased this toy in August 2011, my cat only a few months old. Instantly, it became her favorite toy. She would bat it around, chase after it, and carry it in her mouth to different rooms. Needless to say, she and those springs became inseparable. In fact, the only time when I would not see her with it (aside from the obvious sleeping, eating, etc) would be when they would all get stuck under the refrigerator. Of course, she would immediately let me know by pawing underneath it and glancing up at me. In time, she mastered ways to try and avoid losing the springs to the fridge. It is now June 2012, and they are still my cat's favorite toys. Regardless of how many new toys I get her, she always goes back to the springs. Without a doubt, these springs are a wonderful investment that I would recommend to any cat owner."
1,"Eh, my cat could care less","She has zero interest in this toy. I've tried throwing, rolling, and springing them, and she doesn't care at all."
5,An absolute joy!,"This package of ""squirllies"" are an absolute hit! We own and operate a cat rescue and every one of our rescues absolutely love these toys!!! I'd thought there was only 4 of these in the package but when opening them, several fall out as they are intertwined within each other. These rock! Your cats will love them!!"
4,Only 4 stars because...,... it turns out there's wire inside them after all; they're not just plastic. Because of that I feel they can become a hazard if the cat chews on them or manages to bite the plastic off.
5,Cat loves it!,"I have bought every toy under the moon - small/big & expensive/cheap. This is by far my cats favorite toy. I'm ordering more because they play with them so often that they end up under pieces of furniture. So hopefully the more I have the longer they will last while I'm at work.Great product, must have for an active cat!"
3,Kitty is indifferent,"My 2-year-old cat Miko played with these a little at first, but now she either ignores them or runs away from them when I try to play with her. She's a bit shy and weird at times, so it really does depend on the cat if they will like this toy or not. She'd much rather play with a crumpled-up piece of paper, but that's just how my cat is; your cat may love these. I do think the springs are cute, though, and I will probably give them to a friend for their cat or a shelter."
5,great item,Good product. My kitty didn't get into it but that is because she is weird. She only plays with bottle caps. But I think more playful kittens or cats would love it.
3,Nice for cats. Not for dogs.,"Great concept and cats love them. The one problem is they're hazardous for dogs. Our dog loved them too, but the plastic coils break easily and wind up being ingested. That's a vet bill most of us don't need.NOTE TO VENDOR: PUT A WARNING ON, OR IN, THE PLASTIC BAG HOLDING THESE TOYS."
4,colorful cat toy springs,"My one cat plays with these once in a while and the other cat doesn't. If I throw them, they will go after them. Good deal for the money...even better if they play with them."
5,4 paws up!,"My cats love these. What more can I say, except some day when I move, I'm going to find a zillion of these under my bookcases."
2,Cats not interested,"My 1-year-old cats have zero interest in these. If I wiggle them in front of them for a second and toss them, they'll go sniff the springs, maybe bat it once or twice, and then walk away. Since it was a 10-pack, I think I'm just going to give them away and hope my mother's cat likes them better!"
1,Not so great,"I have extremely picky cats,they liked them for maybe 15 min. and they were over it.I thought they were going to be bigger than they were as well."
4,They are what they are,"They are exactly as advertised. I had hoped that since my cat was into rubber bands, that she might also enjoy these, but she pretty much ignores them. Not that the springs are at fault, my Josey just isn't into playing, and these didn't help."
1,BEWARE METAL SPRINGS!,"Please beware before buying!! Some vendors are selling metal springs. They are dangerous to both animals and people. God forbid if a someone stepped on these..it would easily go thru your foot. I've ordered these in the past from other vendors and they have been plastic. Unlike others I'm not throwing them away...I'm RETURNING them. If the vendor that sells them as 'ethical' continues to make money on them, they won't carry the proper plastic springs. I ordered mine thru Audio Haus, LLC and they were metal."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"The springs I received were metal with sharp edges. They were painted, still reek of paint, and the paint is peeling. Amazon was very helpful in the return process, but these should not be allowed to be sold as a pet toy. They resemble carburetor diaphragm springs. Very dangerous!"
3,Only fun if you have hardwood floors/tile,"My cat loves these little springs while playing in my kitchen where I have tile floors until she takes the spring to the living room where I have carpet. She looses interest immediatley since the spring won't bounce or role any longer. So if you have hardwood floors in your home these springs are great, but they definetly stop being fun on carpet."
5,My cats love it!,"I have two cats, and these springs are their favorite. They just love batting these around and chasing them, and they never get sick of these inexpensive toys. I suggest buying extras, as these springs get lost pretty easily. I used to buy them at a local store and then was disappointed when the store stopped carrying them. Luckily, I found them on Amazon! These springs end up under furniture, doors, kitchen appliances, and the washer and dryer. You can fetch them out with a yardstick, but these things do have a knack for disappearing. I usually ration them out to my cats until all have disappeared, and then every once in a while, I get out the yardstick and go searching for the lost ones.Edit: My springs are plastic, but I purchased them years ago. Now I see that they are metal and could be potentially dangerous. I like my plastic springs, but I don't think I would buy metal ones. :-("
5,Excellent cat toy,"My cats love these. I ordered four sets because they go missing for days at a time, only to end up in a cache behind a chair or in the basement. My cats will play with these for hours. Our favorite game is fetch. I toss it, the two little ones bat it about a bit, then one of them brings it back to me for the next round. Having a small black cat walk up to me with one of these sticking up in the air makes all the harder parts of the day just fade away."
1,Horrifying! Unsafe!,"Thought these were made of plastic. Received heavy metal springs covered in a plastic colored casing. Not even the same colors as the photos. These would have harmed my cats if I had let them play with them...scratched them, puncture wounds or even putting an eye out. What was the vendor thinking to send out wires for pet toys. Will be requesting a refund right away."
2,Not fun for older cats,"I feel that this cat toy is for kittens only. I have a 2 year old female who loves to play with everything and she hated this toy. She sniffed at it and then walked away, i never seen her do that to any toy, so just be aware that this toy isn't much fun, but the price is ok if you got extra money to lend out."
1,Ignored by Cat,"I got this for my cat because it has good reviews. However, my cat IGNORES them. Even when I throw them at her all she will do is jump up and them leave them where they fall. I would not recommend this product."
5,Happy Kitty,My cat went nuts over these. Wish I had more because I get tired of fishing them out from under the furniture. But if I don't she cries till I do. More fun than all the others.
1,I agree that it is potentially dangerous...,"It's made out of some hard plastic and it is not wise to leave this around cats unsupervised. They can break it into pieces, and it can enter the stomach and pierce the tissues in there, and through the intestines.I would not recommend this even though it is highly recommended for this reason."
3,Cats didn't really like them!,"My cats really didn't like them, they are laying all over the house, but I rarely if ever see them being played with and my cats love to play. They are well made and spring back easily."
5,Cat won't play with them,"Cat won't play with them, but still have five stars because they do what their supposed to do, their good quality, and probably a more interesting cat would play with them, but not my kittie, she just watches me throw it around trying to get her to play with it and gives me a dumb stare."
1,Buyer BEWARE - All spring Toys are NOT the same!!!!!,"I just got my order for these and like others, I will read reviews more carefully in the future. I thought I was buying plastic, safe cat toy that I had before (Frankie the Tonkinese has now hidden all of them somewhere)... What I got when I opened the bag were spray painted, thin , SHARP actual metal springs...the paint smell alone made me wince. They went right into the trash.... Buyer beware.I have located what I really wanted at Dr Fosters & Smith...called SPOT and described as safe and plastic... http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/prod_display.cfm?pcatid=17162"
2,Cheap and Not Bouncy,"I expected these to bounce as a real spring would when swatted by my cats, but they just kind of roll around and they cats have no interest in them. Also, they are a very thin plastic that can splinter."
2,Depends on which seller you use,"I bought these a few months ago from 'A World of Pups and Pets' and they were great - thick plastic (or maybe metal coated in thick plastic? They were durable, whatever they were). My cats go bonkers for these, so much so that I just reordered, this time using seller 'AudioHaus' (also known as 'Mobile Solutions'). And yeah, these new ones are awful thin metal, with chipping paint and a strong smell. They were inexpensive but I'm still going to return them and write a negative review, because these don't seem safe at all.That said - if you can get the springs from a seller who's not AudioHaus/Mobile Solutions, you might want to take your chances and hope you get the good ones. The original springs are wonderful."
2,Ethical Wide Colorful lSprings-Cat Toy,I have purchased cat springs before from SPOT. They were coated with thick plastic and had no sharp edges. They were great. The ones from Ethical had sharp ends and were very thin. I would not purchase this brand again.
2,Not Interested,I did everything in my power to interest my cats in these toys to no avail. They won't look twice at them. I'm really disappointed too as I had read some really good reviews on this product. There's a certain smell to the toy that they don't seem to care for. I'm not sure what it is. It's like a factory smell. Maybe that's why they don't seem to care for it. I've tried airing out the springs but that doesn't seem to have helped either. Either I have three very weird cats or these toys aren't all they're cut out to be.
5,surprising find,"Saw these springs several places and wondered why a cat would like this... but got such good reviews on Amazon figured I would try it. Amazingly, kitty loves these probably more than any other toy (except da bird) and he plays with them every day. Great for getting exercise AND he actually plays fetch with them -- he loves it when we throw them across the room for him so much he will retrieve and bring back to us over and over again. Plays fetch better than alot of dogs I have seen!"
5,Such simple toys but my cat loves them!,"It took my kitty a minute to figure out that she liked these but all it took was one swat that hit the spring just right and she was hooked! Other reviewers are correct in that these are great, inexpensive, toys though they can disappear quickly (what cat toy doesn't right?).I think she likes them because when the start to get away she can easily pick it up with her mouth and relocate! Fun and great exercise for her, cheap entertainment for us. Would highly recommend."
2,"The springs do not ""spring"" the way I thought they would...","I was expecting these to be great toys for my cats that would bounce when you dropped them on the floor. I read a lot of good reviews and was excited because I thought my cats would love them. Unfortunately, the springs do not bounce the way I thought they would. You have to drop them just right to get them to bounce even a little bit, rather than just falling flat. They really are not bouncy at all, and my cats just don't know what to do with them."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,first off they didn't come in the so called package they show on top. It came wrapped in plastic all tangled together. I had to undo them all which was just stupid.Another thing is if you do decide to buy them your cats will play with it but be warned!!!! Once there done playing they will be traps for you at night. I stepped on one during the night and let me tell you that sucker stuck me good! the points are sharp. so buy at your own risk i wont buy these things again.
1,you gotta be kidding me,"I bought these worthless things based on reviews. I have no clue now what kind of entertainment they are supposed to be and neither does my cat. They bounce??? Seriously? No more than any other object. If you drop them just right, on their end, they bounce up once [not very high, and no more than any other object] and that's it. The cat could care less. I can drop a pen and it bounces higher than these things. But so what. I've never seen a cat that will get interested, beyond noticing, just because something bounces once or twice. These are a joke, and I suspect all the nice reviews are from the manufacturers. I wish there were a minus star rating so I could rate these properly. Total Joke and a rip-off."
2,I just can't get him interested,"My cat just isn't at all interested in these springs. On the other hand, my vacuum robot loves them way too much and always gets them tangled up in its brush roller. It's a nasty habit for a robot to get into. But I didn't buy these for the robot, I bought them for the cat.To be fair, my cat is VERY picky about toys, and I'm sure some cats might love the heck out of these, but mine does not, and I am writing this review on his behalf."
1,what ARE these?,"I expected these ""Ethical"" cat toys to be something more than recycled wires. My cats aren't interested in them, and I'm glad they are not, since I don't think they are safe for animals to play with."
1,Horrible,Item was described to be a safe plastic cat toy what arrived was wire dipped in paint. It had a very unpleasant smell and the wire was very brittle. I decided to throw the wires away rather then risk seriouse harm to my cats.
1,The Cats Give it a Paws Down,"Usually at least one of my cats goes NUTS for any highly rated cat toy Amazon, but in this case none seemed to want anything to do with these springs. I kept trying to launch them in a way to make them seem more appealing/exciting, but my cats didn't care for them at all. A few months ago I had bought a similar cat toy to these (a plastic circle that's easily batted around on hardwood floors and able to able to be picked up in the mouth) and they liked that a lot more. I don't recommend these toys, but every cat is different so...it may work for other cats."
1,METAL- DO NOT BUY,"I was so excited when I ordered 2 more packs of these springs because my cat absolutely loves them. But, when the springs arrived, they were nothing like the previous order. The new springs are thin metal and coated with paint!! No way is this safe for a cat to play with! I returned it right away and will not be buying these again. The seller needs to revise this product to reflect what they are really selling. No one likes to be tricked."
1,Paint chips off,"These springs are horrible. They are made with metal (not plastic) and coated with paint. As I was prying the springs apart, the paint chipped off! The ends are also sharp. I think I'll just stick with those little foam balls. Sending these back for a refund."
1,These are different METAL springs. Do not buy!,I purchased these a few months ago and they were the plastic springs. They were wonderful and the cats loved them. I just ordered another set and what arrived are crappy metal springs in flaking paint. This is totally unacceptable and I'm sending them back today. Hello Amazon: talk to this supplier! What they have listed and what they are shipping are two different things. If it was possible I'd give zero stars. DO NOT BUY THESE!
1,METAL!! NOT PLASTIC,"THese are metal, not plastic like the picture. The picture was taken from a different item that is plastic. The pointy ends are dangerous. We have not given these to our cats, put just separating them has scratched off the coating.I bought from the picture because I have bought these before. The others were plastic."
1,Unsafe for cats,"I received these springs as a Christmas gift. My cats have played with (and LOVED) this type of toy before. BUT...these particular springs are metal springs (the ones I've bought before are plastic) and they are poorly painted. When I opened the package, the smell of paint was overwhelming and the paint was chipping off the springs. There are also lots of sharp edges. I realize my cats aren't children but I just don't feel safe letting them play with these. I will be returning and will buy them some more plastic ones elsewhere."
1,"Horrible! Suppose to be plastic, but came as metal.","Don't order, unless you like to gamble! This is the third time I ordered these and, the first two times they were in a nice professional package labeled properly and the springs were made of plastic. My cat loved them. This time I ordered from the same place and they arrived today wrapped in plastic like someone put them in saran wrap, and they were not labeled. The worst of all is that the springs were made of metal, and they were entwined together and impossible to separate. Not that I would have let my cat play with them anyway considering they were metal and had rough edges and would have cut her mouth and paws. Where are the big plastic springs that came the first two times???!!!Wow what a horrible rip off. Amazon should be ashamed dealing with this seller."
5,My Cat Loves These!!!,"Well designed, clever, and very motivating for my cat!! He chases these all over the house, makes them spring up from the floor, and the fact that they kind of ""roll"" on their own when they are nudged or are on uneven surfaces makes him even more determined to ""get"" them! Great to leave around the house so my cat can play on his own too. Great colors, very sturdy, and I like that I don't really have to worry about him breaking them or hurting himself. I have to keep buying more because so many get lost around the house (under the couch especially - that is his favorite game!) and we can never seem to have too many lying around for him. This is my third package so far and I will keep buying these again in the future too!"
4,Not a favorite of both of my cats,I have 2 cats and this isn't either cats favorite toy. One of them will play with it if I put it in a fun place.
5,Awesome!,Our older cat absolutely loves these! Our only issue is he won't let the little one even go near them! Great inexpensive toy and fast shipping. Thank you!
2,cat toy,I thought these springs would be something my cat would play with. Unfortunately he didn't even look at them.
1,OUCH!,Just not good. These are NOT plastic nor 'heavy gauge'. They are maybe 20ga metal and poked MY fingers just trying to get them out of the package. Certainly not going to let my cats play with them.
1,Bounce? NOT Wobble? NOT,"I was excited when these toys arrived, and opened the package immediately. I threw the springs down on the floor; I tried to make them bounce; I batted them around; I did everything I could think of to get my cats to notice them. They didn't budge from their perches. They even looked at me as if I were crazy. The plastic is rigid and does not bounce unless you squeeze them together very hard between your fingers, then let them go. They don't skitter around on the floor, which is something that would attract nearly any cat. My rating would be a zero, if that were possible. I felt totally ripped off."
1,Not interested,"Our rambunctious cat had no interest in these springs and it hurts human feet when you step on them. I thought they would ""spring"" up in the air when played with."
5,The Best,"The only problem with these is that within minutes two of them have been driven under the refrigerator or the couch. I have 4 cats and they all love them. I've purchased several packets and since they are cheap, its fun to have a package in the drawer at all times for the next round. The cats toss them the air, drive them like a soccer ball, and chase them after tossing them themselves. Hours and hours of fun."
5,love at first sight,"Two (of three) of my cats love these! In the spirit of supervising the best I can, I only gave them a couple so I could keep track. They are HIDDEN but every so often I hear something solid hitting my furniture. Ah ha! A spring has come out of hiding! The third cat who doesn't like these only likes feather toys and straws, so I wasn't phased. My other two (a 3 year old tabby and a 6 year old maine coon) were overjoyed!"
3,Cute springs,"I saw some other cats enjoying these springs, so I bought some for my kids. My cats are not super interested in them, but will interact with them some. I was just hoping they would like them more. A quality product, and I am sure other folk's cats might really love them (like my friend's cat did!)"
5,"Excellent Product, What Fun For My Teenage Cat!","My teenage cat has had an enormous amount of fun with these colorful springs. In fact, so much fun that all 10 of them are scattered all over my house. I may just have to buy another pack or two. They are great, clever idea. Thank You for giving my cat hours of entertainment!"
5,ability to make dinner in peace- priceless!,Our two six-month old kittens LUV these! They chase them around on the wood and tile floors and have a blast for hours. Highly reccommended. We bought 3 more packs.
1,Epic FAIL,"My cat has no interest in playing with these. He chases the kind of cat toys that you wave around in the air, such as ""Da Bird"", with vigor. He barely even looks at these. I was very disappointed."
3,Caution - materials changed,"This has been my cat's favorite toy, in fact I can't seem to purchase enough (I think there's a vortex in my house where they all disappear to!). However, with this last order, the springs are completely different. First. the colors are muted and dull - not what you see in the picture represented on the site. Second, the springs used to look like they were plastic-coated wire. Now they are just wire and the ends feel very sharp. I've given my cat a couple to see what she does with them, but I'm not pleased with the change."
1,DO NOT BUY! DANGER!!,"These just arrived today (Jan 13th, 2012) and I wish I would have read the reviews for this item before I bought it. I was buying ""Da Bird"" and these horrible springs were part of an Amazon ""buy with"" promotions.Like others have said, these are thin, wire, cheaply painted, and have very, very sharp ends.Amazon you need to stop selling these. People who buy them are just going to complain and return them."
1,DO NOT BUY!! These are now metal!!!,"I bought this product about a year ago, and they were colorful plastic springs. My cats loved them, and they became one of their favorite toys. Due to attrition, I ordered the exact same thing from my Amazon order history. They just arrived, and as many reviewers are now posting, they are now very sharp and thin, and probably brittle, METAL springs. The paint on them smells VERY bad, and I will not allow my cats to play with these. They are going back!"
1,Springs are not the ones pictured!,"I received metal, spray painted springs with sharp ends instead of the ones pictured. Do NOT order this product expecting plastic springs in bold colors!"
1,Do NOT buy these,I received thin wire springs with sharp edges. Nothing like pictured! The paint is missing from most of them leaving exposed sharp wires. I couldn't give these to my cat without her getting hurt. DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!
1,"Rusty, dangerous toys","These toys are usually made of plastic. There was nothing in the product description about these being made of metal with sharp ends. The springs arrived tangled together, rusty, and with flaking paint. There is no way that I'd let my cats play with these things."
3,Spring Cat Toy,"Maybe our cats are just really picky about toys, but neither our 12 year old cat nor the 9 month old kitten is interested in this toy. I've tried everything to get them to play with them, but to no avail. Both cats are declawed, so perhaps this has something to do with it. They can't pick the toy up...but they are not interested in batting it around either. They show much more interest in the little plastic band that comes off the vitamin bottle caps when they are first opened."
1,Do not purchase! Item not as described.,I received metal springs rather than plastic. There would be VERY dangerous to give to a cat. The edges are sharp and the paint is pretty noxious. Not recommended.
4,Endless fun for Kittens,"I ordered these for my 3 mo. old kittens. Hands down, they love it! It's provided endless hours of fun. And the price is definitely right. The only drawback is that the little springs get lost behind furniture, etc. I guess it's going to be the gift that keeps giving?"
5,Great cat toy!,"We have two sister cats, Tessa and Talia, who are about 2 years old. They bat these springs around the house, carry them in their mouths to where they want them and get lots of exercise. They love them and I love watching them play with them."
1,These are not a safe toy,This product has sharp edges that could give puncture wounds to cats and their human friends. I threw them away once I realized how dangerous they could be. I do not recommend buying this product at all.
1,Colorful Springs Cat Toy,"My cat wasn't intrigued by this toy at all. Her favorite challenge is retrieving a cloth ball which she brings back to us to throw again, over and over."
2,Not what ordered,"Received was an 80 slide tray in a 140 tray box and it was not new. The house mechanic had to assemble it properly for it to function. No future purchases will be made using Moo Sisters from whom a ""snippy"" response was received after a response was made to them regarding satisfaction with the product."
4,A n excellent book,Hans Jenny provides excellent experimental notes in this book. The conditions are easy to duplicate and I find the experimentation to be very rewarding. This book is a 'must-have' for anyone who wishes to learn more about the bare bones building blocks of our cosmos...
3,Nice show but a defective disc,"This is a decent show from a great performer although it is a bit ""80's"" sounding and lacks some of the grit that one might find in some of his 70's shows. The main reason I wanted to review this is so everyone that is interested in purchasing this can know that there is a defect on this DVD. At 43:11 into the disc---during of all songs ""People Get Ready""---there is some sort of glitch and the disc skips one second to 43:13 producing a very noticable dropout in the sound. I have checked 2 different copies on 3 different players all with the same results. I have made some inquiries about this disc but haven't been able to get any information on obtaining a corrected copy from anyone."
