2,Disappointing,"The ppi is far to small to enlarge. I had hoped to use the frames for digital scrapbooking, but the images are not suitable for that purpose."
5,Should be part of any comprehensive 90's music collection,"This is one of the best future sounds of the nineties. Gavin Friday is what you can describe as one of the last true artists of the music comunity. He's helped composed for U2's Actung Baby and Zooropa which speaks volumes about where he's from and where's he's going musically. Shag Tobacco is handsdown one of the most fabulous albums in the past decade. Ultra abientism meets rock edginess and blends with jazzy downtempo techno remeniscent of New Order and Radiohead on valium. Combine that with beautifully poetic, hypnotically sensual,quikily cocky, and depressingly fatalistic lyrics, and you've got an album that is not an accident...but a distinctly, well planned work of a modern musical genius."
5,Excellent for learning how to 'be' your true self with others..,"I agree with the reviewer below - ignore the San Jose reviewer. The title describes exactly what it delivers.. Helping people show their 'real' selves. I'm a Clinical Psychologist, and I recommend this to clients who struggle with social anxiety/social phobia.. but also to any clients who are struggling with low self esteem, or social insecurity at any level.. I think it's an excellent book, written simply and clearly, with straightforward suggestions to effect change, and challenge yourself to be your true self with others.."
2,when [possibly] good books have *really* awful titles...,"Sorry -- I'm evaluating some communication books for a large organization -- and I just couldn't get past the title. How could any business person recommend this to a large group of peers...with a straight face...or expect them to take it seriously? Possibly the first rule of good communication, especially when presenting one's written advice and expertise to complete strangers...is to craft a title that actually says something."
5,A forgotten and ignored classic,"Celestina is amusing, ironic, and while the prose and dialogue is long and descriptive, it is never boring- I really enjoyed this play. A note to the person who claims to be the author: Celestina was written in 1499, and it is widely assumed the author lived circa the same time. So, congratultions on your 500th birthday. :)"
4,La Celestina,A classic Spanish literature story written in the Old Style Spanish by fernando De Rojas. Excellent reading and an excellent story with modern applications.
2,OK,"I bought this for a Spanish class. Their are no illustrations and I don't like how the chapters are divided up (oor aren't divided up). OK, enough whining. There are better learning to read Spanish books out there. Yeah, there is challenging Spanish here, but the layout absolutely sucks."
1,Worst Investment,"Pathetic excuse for a DVD player. Cannot read many DVD discs. Very picky when burning your own dvd. Remote control is pathetic. You must be directly in front of player in order to even have a possibility of the player receiving the signal from the remote. I would sell mine, however my conscience will not allow me to!!!!"
1,Junk - dont bother.,"I dont hate HK. In fact, I have one of their receivers which I LOVE.This DVD player however is junk. Reason? Well, it cant keep the audio in sync with the video. Its absolutely unwatchable I tried 6 different DVD's, and ALL of them lost sync - this is inexcusable performance for a player of this ""class"".Furthermore, its ""per-pixel"" rendering software was actually worse than the on-board system of my Panny AE500 projector. I wanted better, or at least as good as a commonplace Panny.On the plus side, it played burnt disks my Sony wont. But I simply could not live with the sync issues. Its worthless in my opinion."
4,Upsize this book,"If you are a liberal, you will no doubt enjoy this book. If you are not, you will no doubt find it juvenile and occasionally offensive. I happen to be the former, and thought it was a very fun, quick read that made politics accessible. Though sometimes it feels rather jerky, and I often found myself wishing that the essays were longer and contained more information, I nonetheless was compelled to pick it up every time I saw it lying around. It reminded somewhat of Al Franken's _Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot_. If you're looking for fun, leftist rhetoric that won't leave you feeling too depressed, you've found it."
1,Can I give negative stars???,"What can I say, this book is drivel but some parts will make you smirk. Smirk, because Moore clearly is on an agenda to make America a socialist country."
1,Extremely juvenile,"Maybe naive, left-leaning undergrads who have never had to really work will find this amusing.I wonder how many of the ""working people"" (most everyone I know works) that Moore claims to champion have any interest in reading this or agree with Moore.Moore fails as a humorist and as a political pundit."
5,"Funny, enjoyable read",Michael Moore has a sense of humor I really get a kick out of. I found his book to be very funny and I even learned a thing or two. Interesting stuff. You will probably not feel the same way though if you are a Republican or a big supporter of corporate downsizing.
5,Moore the muckracker,"No one has emerged on the progressive scene with more creative and flair then Moore. In his book he lays out a series of essays on various topics that sheds some light on what is really going on. I especially liked his Corporate Welfare Mothers section. If he has one fault, it is that the book wanders a good deal in topics, but it is still very very good. I also suggest watching the Awful Truth on Bravo or buying the Tv Nation episodes on Tape, this guy has balls."
3,2nd Book is better.,Once again I read a set of books in the wrong order. Stupid White Men was a great book. Downsize This... not so great. I do sympathize with Michael Moore's comments. It angers you to read some of the things he wrote about big corporations and layoffs. The American Dream is gone. Thankfully I'm Canadian.
1,Less is Moore...,The only funny thing about this book is the chapter where Moore explains why he thinks O.J. Simpson is innocent. That's a real thigh-slapper. Everything else is standard Tofurkey for the liberal choir. I urge right-wingers to read it in order to be able to win any debates with folks who support Moore and his point of view.
1,Liberal Swill,"Book title should be: Random Threats from an Uneducated American by Michael Moron. The comedy value of this book is lost in the ignorant and irrational view of reality held by Mr. Moore. Classic liberal fear mongering, class envy and white male guilt are so pervasive that any laughs are quickly squelched in disgust. This book might be useful for leveling off a piece of furniture with a broken leg"
1,Moore's book is a waste of paper and ink.,"Moore shows a total lack of understanding of economics, corporations, unions, and almost everything. His premise is that corporations' sole function is to have obligations to their employees, and that employees' sole function is to be provided a job by corporations. If you want a mishmash of rewarmed Marxism, and if you think someone owes you a living, buy this book. Otherwise, don't even accept it as a gift."
5,Michael Moore's Nobody's Clown,"I've heard a few doctrinaire types whine about how success has spoiled Michael Moore. Two words for those people: Ba Loney! Those are the same people who think all left-wing books and movies have to follow the precepts of socialist realism: dull and dreary and, in the end, useless.This book has shows Moore to be sharper and a lot angrier than he lets on in his successful movies and television programs. In fact, I was expecting Downsize This! to be a lot lighter than it is. Instead, it's a lot of laughs, but each laugh has a bitter little barb inside.Those still complaining about ""reaching the people"" could take a lot of lessons from Moore, and I have no trouble recommending it to anyone who has suddenly realized that things aren't all that great in this tired old world of ours."
3,"not great, good","I'm sort of surprised: everyone seems to have either loved this book or hated it, when in reality it really shouldn't elicit such strong emotions. I'm a liberal to the core, and thus I agree with most of what Moores says, but sometimes, well--the chapter on Germany was just scary. You get the vague impression as you're reading it that it must be satire--there is no WAY this guy can be serious. And yet...he is. There's just no denying it. The chapter on rioting was similar in nature, although I did appreciate the instructions on how to illegally immigrate, which would no doubt have rubbed many the wrong way. Beyond the obvious firebranding nature of the aforementioned chapters, there's some pretty hilarious material here; unfortunately, there's also some excruciatingly tedious stuff. Moore's heart is in the right place, but he's just not a particularly good satirist. What else can I say? It's worth reading, but it's not as great as I had hoped it would be."
5,This book made me angry and motivated,"There's so much talk of whether or not Moore stretches the truth or fabricates his material, but if even 1/4 of what he says in Downsize This is true, it's enough to get you angry and motivated enough to go out and make a change in our world."
4,complicity and corporate pillaging,"How coincidental is this that I pick up Belzer's book, ""UFOs, JFK, and Elvis,"" and this one on the same day at the library? Of course, Michael's nemeses are the corporate giants who are pillaging small town USA in their continual quest for more profits. And yet, some of the same concerns about government complicity and comments about JFK's assassination echo in this seriously abridged version of the book. Moore also reads his own material with great gusto and conviction. Get both these books for a seriously creepy feeling about your government and big business!"
2,Mild,"I just finished ""Downsize This"" by Micheal Moore and I must say I found it somewhat mild in terms of creativity. There was some interesting material, but most of it was simply his thoughts on political issues (and it was very dated). I guess that is why he called it ""Random Thoughts"". I really think that I could have done just as good of a job myself. So why is it that Michal Moore can get a book contract and I cannot? I thought that perhaps the publisher would offer him a contract beacuse of his track record, but after ""Downsize This"" I realize that the publisher knows that people like me will think ""Hey that Micheal Moore guy that made that great movie Roger and Me now has a book out. I think I'll go buy it."" They don't much care what Micheal has to say as long as he completes a book they can sell. Funny how alot of things come down to money (with the exception of 'Roger and Me' which, incidentally, I think is one of the best movies I ever saw)."
3,Back When Moore Had a Real Issue......,"This is from an era where Micheal Moore actually made valid points. I'm a Republican, but I'm also a Christian. That means I believe that people are supposed to give a darn about something besides just money. Greed and heartlessness in the corporate world are very real... though I'm a capitalist, this greed thing is something that I struggle with. There are folks who lose their jobs for no reason at all, hard working people with nowhere to go.It's not right.But when the government gets involved, I can't say things are made any better.Nonetheless, Moore makes some valid points in this book, which is from an era when he was more than an anti-gun, anti-war loony."
2,Written with humor,"If you are a reader looking for unadulterated Communism, this book would be of interest to you."
2,Michael should stick to film,"I should preface my review by saying I am a huge Michael Moore fan. His films ""Rodger and Me"" and ""Canadian Bacon"" were great. His tv shows TV nation and The Awful Truth were also excellent. This book is not.This books is tirade against corporate america, which is expected. What is not expected is that it is not funny. There are attempts at humor like trading cards of corporate criminals that just don't make anybody laugh.So besides humor a good tirade needs to be hard hitting. There are a few moments where some references to NAFTA really make the world look ugly, or when layoffs really seem unncessary. However, the hard hitting things are few and far between.If you are a really hardcore Michael Moore fan you might like this book, but for the casual Michael Moore fan it is a too poorly written."
3,Complete your collection!,"Though I wouldn't consider this the best Happy Flowers album, it IS a collection-completer. The first half of the album are songs that were (you guessed it) released on 45. The second half of the album are live songs and songs from the various bands Mr. Anus and Mr. HCI were in throughout the years. If you're looking for a first exposure to the Happy Flowers, I would suggest their album ""Oof""; it's the most representative of their work, followed by ""Lasterday I Was Been Bad,"" and then this one. The Happy Flowers are definitely an acquired taste, but if you are into quirky college radio-type bands and fun, DIY punk, you'll definitely enjoy these guys. They're like two little kids banging away on drums and screwing around with noisy guitars, screaming about all the major kid issues: having to go to school, eating food you think is gross, picking at your scabs, and playing games that end up with you crying because you got hurt. Music to annoy your parents with!"
2,Don't bother,"This is a total waste of paper. Save the forrest, do not print books like that!Most of the stuff from this book can be easily found on the net. And also the book does not cover most of the topics. There is not a single part of the book that describes well any of the .NET concepts"
2,Where's the errata sheet or web address?,"I'm a beginner and already have hit errors on page 47:Start>Programs>MS SQL server>Configure SQL XML support in IISMy computer yield the following:Start>Programs>MS SQL server>>Books online>Client network utility>Enterprise manager>Import and export data>Profiler>Query analyzer>Readme.txt>Server netowrk utility>Service manager>Uninstall SQL server 7.0There is no mention of Configure XML support in IIS!I'm tired of buying books with sloppy technical editing. Oh, to read just one book on VB .net that didn't have an error in the first 50 pages."
3,Good but a rip-off,"Does what it is supposed to do, but paying $38 for a piece of plastic that probably costs 50 cents to produce is crazy."
2,character flaws,"I wanted to like this book. I read it in a day, pushing through chapter after chapter just to see how it would end. But, in the end, I didn't care nearly enough about the characters. I believe it's because of what one reviewer already mentioned - one dimensional, idealistic characters. It was mildly entertaining, but I didn't finish with much to keep me thinking about. I like the concept of the book - diary entries that a character is reading, but I found the characters overaly idealized.I've never read any of Patterson's other novels, but I know this one is unique in its genre. I'm guessing since he's such a successful author, it's also unique in its flat characters."
4,What a great human story,"I am a big fan of James Patterson with books like Kiss the Girls, Cat & Mouse and the like. However, I discovered a small piece of Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas in a magazine and instantly knew I had to read the book. I went to the bookstore that very day and bought it - could NOT put it down! Patterson swept me into the lives of the Katie and Matt and Suzanne & Nicholas in the first few pages, and I had to know what happened next. He made me feel what they were feelingunlike any other author I've read before. I throoughly enjoyed the book and hope Patterson continues to explore this softer side of his writing."
4,Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas,"James Patterson proves that he can write more than just murder mysteries in this touching novel of a woman who desires to leave a legacy to her unborn child. Suzanne seemed to be perfect. Katie is the new love in Matt's life, or she was before he walked out. Reading the diary that Suzanne left to Nicholas will cause her to see Matt in a whole new light. Be prepared to shed some tears in this heartbreaking story."
5,REALLY GOOD!,"James Patterson, if you're reading this ... WRITE PART TWO!This book was SO good! I recommend this book to my friends!Yes, I vote five stars, but ... five stars PLUS! More like TEN stars!"
2,Silly,"I am very surprised that this book is not subtitled ""Aren't I lucky?"" I must have read the word lucky at least 50 times in this short book! I found the ending of this book contrived so as to create surprise, as in other places. The writing was very juvenile. It is, however, a sure to be TV movie! I can picture Sela Ward there with some gorgeous, rugged unknown at her side. If you read a lot of good books; a serious reader, save your money and your time."
2,A big disappointment,"I have heard many good things about James Patterson's books, and I thought this one sounded like an interesting concept. I was disappointed with how unrealistic the book is. It could be appealing if you wanted to believe that everyone in the world is beautiful, smart and successful. Patterson seems to spend more time telling you how the characters feel instead of SHOWING you how they feel through their actions. The reader is intelligent and can figure things out through hints, and getting to know the characters instead of being given everything. That was my problem with it. I thought it will silly and overly sentimental."
2,glad it was over quick!!!,"This is the first time reading a Patterson book and to be honest I wish I had started with one of his better ones. I agree with many of the other readers that this book was way too sappy. I found the writing to be too simple almost to the point that it was insulting. I gave this book two stars because I think the idea was good and the formatt of it, written in letter form, was different. Having said that, if your looking for a well written, romantic, tear jerker this is not the one. I would reach for a Nicholas Spark's book any day of the week!!"
1,What a waste of time!,"I cannot believe an accomplished writer wrote this book. It was so juvenile in it's writing. The premise of the novel was good but the execution was very bad. It couldn't have taken James Patterson more than an hour to complete this mockery of a novel. The characters were so one-dimentional. I finished it against my better judgement, hoping it might get better. But it didn't and I cringed the whole time reading the unrealistic, and sappy dialogue."
3,Entertainment for One Evening.,"This was a first of James Patterson words for me and frankly, I could do without. I read somewhere that this book was a first romance novel for him and it shows. The characters are unreal and the plot too predictable. The idea was good and perhaps this story would have been better if he really took the time to write it instead of doing what seems to read as a rush job. I mean come on! The people were too perfect! I want someone I can relate to and the man in my dreams isn't THAT wonderful! I gave this book 3 stars because it was easy to read and a nice alternative to the same old shows on the tele."
4,"A quick, fun read",I received this book has a birthday gift and read the book while traveling home. This is a 180 degree turn from the usual Patterson books but a nice change of pace. This is a good book for a vacation or a long bath. Enjoy!!
4,Suzannes Diary,I thought this was a great book. I read it so fast because I had no idea what was going to happen. I thought the story was very realistic and you can relate to both sides. I liked the idea of a diary for your child too. The mother and son relationship was beautiful. It was a down to earth good book.
3,Better than Bridges of Madison County,"I think Patterson read Bridges of Madison County and thought, ""Heck, I can do better than that!"" and he did. It is not a typical James Patterson, but it's a better romance/tearjerker than most. It does not involve cheaters. It DOES have a perfectly charming and surprising description of the great love that can occur between a mother and child. And, best of all, it ends rather well. I hate sad endings."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE!,"This book was great because I was looking for a quick read, I literally read this in one day. I smiled while reading it and then cried my eyes out at times too. I really think if you are looking for a tear jerker then this is the book for you.People said this was a very predictable book, I mean sure at times it was...but most books are unless you're reading a mystery. Overall this book was a great quick read for a rainy day :-)"
1,"I only gave it one star because ""zero"" was not an option","I truly believe that James Patteron DID NOT write this book. It was not his style at all! I am not a huge Patterson fan, but I have read a couple of his books and enjoyed them. ""Suzanne's Diary"" wasn't even a story. It was embarrasingly predictable and almost painful to read. He must have owed someone a favor and got their book published under his name."
1,"Great Premise, but unreal characters - sappy","When I heard the premise of the book - a man breaking off an affair, and giving his mistress his wife's diary - I was intrigued. But this book misses it by a mile. It could have been a real story, about how people go astray after marriage, or the stress a new baby brings to a relationship. And how a happy couple changes with time in ways they didn't forsee. That's a real story. This is the quality of a romance novel where all the characters are good looking and perfect (but yet apparently not bright enough to use birth control). In the end it's a sappy story about dull people."
4,not a romantic book fan but still a GREAT BOOK..........,ok i am still not into romantic books.........but dispite it all this is a very good book indeed for it is not just about love it is also about a family and all that heartbreak stuff.............ya there were some cheezzy moments but thanks god they are not over-done..........i hope everyone finishes this book in a day............so that they can be surprised as well with the story...............
1,"""Heartwarming"" my arse!","Predictable, cliché, sappy and no character depth. What a waste of time and money! I can't believe anyone gave this peice of trash a five star review. All the characters of this novel had the same personality and I never got emotionally invested in any of them. Frankly, I couldn't wait for it to come to it's very predictable end so I could finish gagging."
1,Dumbing Down with James Paterson,"I have never read any of James Paterson's prior books so I have no opinion as to how good a writer he might be. All I know is that I feel dumber from having read this improbable piece of drivel. The member of our book club who recommended this book has been properly chastised. If it's a cold winter, I'll burn it in the fireplace putting it to better use than I had from reading it."
2,Amateurish,"The pro's - An easy quick read.The con's - This book is filled with the kinds of characters who only exist in popular fiction. There was no believability there, I couldn't identify with them. Also it was very distracting the way the author kept name dropping/giving shout outs. It wasn't someone took a picture with their camera, it was they used their Canon camera and how many references to watching Ally McBeal can there be. It got real annoying after awhile and interupted the flow.Another flaw is that just by reading the information on the dust jacket you already get an idea of where the story is going before you even read a word.All in all if you are looking for a harmless quick summer read, go for it. If you want a bit more, skip it."
2,Less than perfect,I found the characters in this book too perfect. Even the tragedies were perfect. It was like reading a Lifetime Movie Channel movie. I could not relate to these characters. I would recommend any book by Maeve Binchy if you want to read about characters that are believable.
2,James Patterson Tries to be Nichols Sparks,"Predictable, self absorbed characters. I'm all for a good love story but this was awful. I hope I never meet people like Suzanne and Katie. Patterson should stay with what he knows and what he does so well."
1,"No ""Bridges of Madison County""","At first I hesitated to buy this book because I felt it would not meet my expectations. Then I read some of the reviews and saw the author on the Today show and decided to take a chance. Boy was I disappointed!!! The story and characters were just not believable at all. I was hoping for another ""Bridges of Madison County"" and instead got a cheap romance novel. [....]"
1,Every bit as ordinary the second time around,"I despised this book the first time I read it, but recently I picked it up to see if my judgement had been clouded. It hadn't. This book is so awful I feel compelled to write this review to *prevent* people wasting money and time on reading it. Its every bit fluff, pop culture reference name dropper, thin translucent characters and awful narrative and grammar that can possibly be,I've read *fanfiction* and tenth grade essays more fulfilling than this novel. I won't go into the plot--its not worth it. I'm not a cold hearted person at all, hey one of my favourite novels is Judy Blume's ""Tiger Eyes"" (and i'm 19!) this book just made me laugh, and NOT in the good way. I'm sorry to say but only simple minds can be pleased by this very, very ludicrous, watery effort by James Patterson, a doctors office/airport/beach read at best."
1,My first Patterson book a real disappointment.,"Admittedly, I'm not finished with it yet, but I'm very disappointed. The writing is juvenile and the characters are shallow. Patterson doesn't seem to have any insight into real women at all. These characters seem based on stereotypes of sappy, romance novels.Not enough real description. Too much use of generic adjectives like ""great,"" and ""real fun."" This just tells me he doesn't understand his characters. As a result, neither do I."
1,i can't believe most people liked this book!,"I thought that this book was not very good at all. I, an 18 year old girl, felt like it was below my reading level. It was written for 13 year old teenie boppers. The characters are not complex or described well at all. The plot is predictable and not very interesting. I read the book in about 2 days because I was bored and it just bored me more. Anyone with intelligence would not like this book. Go for a Nicholas Sparks book if you want a romance, it at least is a little more in-depth."
1,Gimme a break!,"The trend seems to be for novelists in an established genre to branch out into other types of fiction. Grisham and Baldacci tried it with spotty results, and now Patterson. I was interested to see how Patterson would handle a love story, and found that he handled it poorly. The characters seemed shallow, the outcome was predictable, and the romance was so idealized that it became ridiculous. Not only was the plot unbelievable and naive, but there were several details in the book that defied common sense. First: how would a physician with a heart condition who barely survived childbirth allow herself to become pregnant again, and not terminate the pregnancy if she did? Second: cardiac surgery involves large incisions down the center of the chest and down the length of one leg, as well as potentially down a second limb. So how could Matt not have noticed this, and why would Suzanne have to ""confess"" this surgery to him? Stick with writing thrillers, Mr. Patterson!"
2,Unimaginative,"This was the lightest, quickest, and most thoughless read I have had in years. My bookclub chose the book, and to be honest, I have no idea what we will discuss. There was nothing thought-provoking about the book, and the parables were agnozingly simple."
1,I love James Patterson's books.....but not this one,"I normally love James Patterson's books, so I was disappointed with this one. His suspense novels are awesome! I knew where he was headed with this one right off, and I just didn't care for the story."
1,"Didn't like it, couldn't finish it","Calling it a ""fast read"" doesn't begin to describe it. The book almost isn't there: short sentences, short paragraphs, short chapters, big type. This isn't a novel; it's a chapter book, only it has sex in it and it's shelved alongside the books for grownups.The story was hardly there either. It was more like a set of cues for a guided fantasy. If other readers are finding it moving and meaningful, I'm happy for them. Personally, I found I wasn't enjoying what was happening, and I didn't care what was going to happen, and anyway I was tired of doing all the work; so I put it aside and never went back."
2,A Patterson Flop,"HELP! I must have missed something while reading this book. I did not need any kleenex to read this Danielle Steele look-alike. How beautiful and wonderful and perfect can everyone be? James, PLEASE go back to mysteries! I was so amazed to read the reviews that raved and raved over this book! Thank heavens this was a library book and I suffered no outlay of cash."
4,couldn't put it down,"This book was wonderful. I found it to be a very quick read and full of emotion. My only question is ""are there really men like Matt???"" If so, where?"
4,Good Read for Irving fans,"As a die-hard fan of John Irving and the ilk of sad, exploratory, and introspective novels that showcase characters over plot, I found this book and the characters richly developed. Not quite at the level of a Cider House Rules, it nonetheless captured (and kept) my attention the entire way through. I will definitely read more Patterson after reading this book. I am sure many will find the book a bit ""mushy"" or romantic, so make sure you can endure a good helping of romance before picking it up."
2,I wouldn't recommend this book to a mother,"From the very beginning of the book I was emotional. About halfway through the book, after blubbering for most of the book, I realized that it was going to get more sad and ended up flipping through the last 50 pages or so. It was very predictable and as a mother of a one year old son, it was very hard for me to read. I was drawn into the book and read most of it quickly but I was hoping for a happy ending and was sadly dissapointed. I would raed another book like this if Patterson wrote it as long as someone could tell me in advance that it was a happier book!"
2,What can you say about a mother who died?,"I'm normally a fan of Patterson's work, but really, this was a piece of drivel. His publisher should have paid him NOT to write it -- or at least not to send it out to the bookstores. Love Story all over again, with less of an excuse. Couldn't Katie figure out where the diary was headed from the first page of it? I could."
2,throwback to 30 years ago,"All you people who said this was not typical James Patterson were right. This is typical Erich Segal writing tear-jerker surface-level Love Story in the early '70s just to show he could do it and make money at it. I have to say this book was pretty schlocky, but if you want something that reads fast (which I did this week) and enjoy reading about the perfect lives of yuppies, by all means pick it up. James Patterson is capable of much better writing. I got the book free from someone else, so I dont feel I was taken. If you like romance, family stories, personal tragedy, whatever, there is much better stuff out there to choose from. And if you like Patterson, he's published better stuff, too."
5,Wonderful change for Patterson...#1 book!,"This book was great..read it in a day. Isn't what you would expect, definately 5 stars. Passed on to my mom and she read it in a day and thinks the same! Would recommend this book. I laughed, cryed and was angry all at once..was a great book! READ IT!!!"
5,Great Summer Read,"I read this book right when it came out and couldnt put it down. I had seen an interview with Patterson on television, so I went out and bought the book. It definitely did not disappoint especially if you are a romantic like me."
4,I just wanted an interesting book to read!!!,"I liked the cover and was looking for something interesting to read. I wasn't expecting anything! I have not read any James Patterson before and thought I would try it out. I liked it and came to Amazon looking for more books like it. I am a 39 year old with children and maybe I could relate to it more than an 18 year old. It was an easy, fast read. I think the key was I wasn't expecting anything."
4,Sappy But Sweet...Slight Mystery,"I liked it...I really did...but sappy lovestories are my undoing. Very similar to Nicholas Sparks books, but hey, I liked them too. So cuddle up on the sofa...turn on Delilah's love songs and a glass of wine and enjoy."
3,Beautiful storytelling; plot lacking,"This is the first James Patterson book I've read. Stylistically, I thought it was wonderful. Beautiful language, descriptions, and lessons about life and love.However, the plot was somewhat contrived. It's fairly easy to figure out the ending, although he does put a surprise ""twist"" on it. After the last page, I threw the book down. He left too many unanswered questions."
3,A Fast Read,"This was a good book to read on vacation or at the beach. It is light reading and it goes fast. I really did like it, but it is a little too predictable."
3,"Mushy, romantic, but you can't put it down!","James Patterson deviates from the usual serial murder mystery with this romantic story. Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas is the story of a woman writing to her son. It is also told through the point of view of another woman reading the journal. This is a beautiful story of love, family, tragedy, and recovery. Just when you think the story is predictable and a little too mushy, Patterson delivers a twist that made me cry and also made me recommend this short, quick novel to everyone I see."
2,"A sweet story, but a bit too sappy for me.","If you like stories dripping with tears, you will probably enjoy this story. The story is about a young woman who meets the love of her life, they marry, have a child, and tragedy is always just around the corner. There doesn't seem to be much uplifting about their lives, except perhaps that the memories they make are very nice. This is a fine escape from reality for awhile, and an overall good read, but the story lacks depth, is too predictable, and is gift wrapped at the end, leaving the reader feeling as though it can be put aside and never thought of again. I prefer stories that leave memories with the reader themselves. Still, as Danielle-Steele-ish as it is, you may find that it is poignant in parts, and touches your heart in others."
2,What a piece of fluff,"This book was the choice of my all-female book club; I had my doubts about it before I read it, and it was even worse than I expected. I found the characters and many of their actions unbelievable. And the ending: how convenient that a man who had recently lost his wife and infant son would so easily decide that he had found a new ""love of his life,"" who of course, was pregnant with his child. Instant replacement family coming up, and of course everyone will live happily ever after. I was annoyed and disgusted with the book from about the second page. However, most of the other club members liked it much better while acknowledging that it wasn't exactly a literary masterpiece."
1,clicheed and predictible,"This was a very disappointing book. Great effort was made to make it contemporary by including the most predictible references (""the ordinary couple met unbelievably at JFK and Caroline Bessett's wedding!"") - please! List of current restaurants, ""in"" places, etc. were used to fill the space that substance should have occuppied. Fortunately, the type was large and there are many divider pages so it didn't last long."
2,Pretty lame,"I gave this book two stars because it did hold my attention, sorta. But as one insightful reviewer put it, the story reflects the male perspective entirely. I would hate to think that a well-educated, intelligent professional woman would allow herself to get pregnant because she was ""sure"" her boyfriend was planning to propose. And the emotional gushing--especially towards the end of the book--was really over the top. Okay for escapist reading, but don't expect any lasting insights from this book."
1,Don't give up your day job,"When someone as good as James Patterson veers off into unknown territory, the results are often very disappointing. Patterson should stick to what he does best, and leave the romance to those who know how to write it. This is the worst piece of drivel I've read in ages. The characters are so one dimensional and syrupy sweet, I almost went into a diabetic comma. Everything about it is contrived, from the situations to the dialogue ,and I just didn't care about any of these characters.This book reads like a very long Halmark card. It may possibly entertain a 13 year old having a boring summer,however, I read Gone with the Wind at 13, so, said 13 year old must have very low I.Q. Enough said."
5,WOW!!!,"I read this entire book during a car trip to Florida from NY. I was six months pregnant and usually I get carsick when I read in the car. This time, I was able to read the whole thing with out feeling sick the whole time. What a great book. I was sobbing by the end and my travelling companions thought there was really something wrong with me. If you want a good read, get it, I'm glad I did."
1,I hated this book...it haunted me,"I love James Patterson and the Alex Cross series, and while I knew this book would be nothing like his usual, and I knew it would be a tear-jerker, I was not prepared for the horrid ending. I would recommend NOT reading this book unless you want to be incredibly sad. I was truly haunted by this book and cannot get it out of my mind."
1,Written for a second grader,"I was looking for an easy summer romance to escape through. What I found instead was the most simplistic and predictable novel I've ever read. I did not feel any empathy for any of the characters and found that reading the novel was a waste of time. To be fair, I have been called a literary snob by some friends, but this novel was written for someone with second grade reading capabilities."
1,Written at Second Grade Level,"After hearing so many wonderful things about this book, I was really excited to be loaned a copy. I made it through about 17 pages, then decided I couldn't take any more of the horribly simple writing and trite comments. To quote one, ""She had wanted to be with him all the time. Corny, but true."" Not one paragraph is over 3 sentences long and the book is full of italics for emphasis as if the reader isn't smart enough to know what's important.It saddens me that a book this bad would make it to #1 on the New York Bestseller list. There are so many more wonderful books out there."
2,"Oh please, stop jerking my emotions!","Calculated and overwrought, this book was not bad enough to stop reading, but not good enough to actually enjoy. It was as if the author sat down and said, ""Hummm, that Madison County book did pretty well, let me do one of those."" The characters were cardboard stereotypes and the actions and plot were designed to wrench tears out of the reader. Stick to Anne Tyler if you want stories with real heart to them."
1,sappy and unrealistic,"It took me a seven hour plane ride to finish this book and it was seven hours I will never be able to get back. It took everything I had to keep from busting out laughing at how rediculously unrealistic this book was. Suzanne's diary entries to her infant son, Nicholas, were overly dramatized and extremely hoaky. I can't even begin to believe how a best-selling author was able to think up such garbage. Don't even bother with this one..."
1,"If you love good literature, run away. Fast.","Go to the Hallmark card rack and pick an I Love You card at random. Read the sappy, trite, pre-packaged sentiment. Then expand it into a novel. Voila! You've got Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas. I have nothing against a good romantic tearjerker, but the operative word is ""good."" This is a DREADFUL book, trite, predictable and poorly written. It reads like the work of a lovestruck teenager, not a professional novelist. The ultimate arrogance is when the character Matt writes a slushy poem for his wife and infant son that's supposedly purchased by Atlantic Monthly--which wouldn't touch a piece of dreck like that unless the entire editorial staff ingested hallucinogenic drugs. If you love good writing, stay far away from this one."
1,Sorry and sappy,"I'll admit that I haven't read any other books by James Patterson. However, if this one is any indication of his writing style and prowess, I don't think I'll bother. I teach junior high school, and I honestly believe I have some eighth graders who could have written the story as well or better. It took me less than two hours to read the entire book, and I had pretty much figured out the ending within the first twenty minutes of reading. Ordinarily, I like the idea of reading the diary or journal of the main character (such as in the short story, ""Flowers for Algernon""), but Suzanne's diary was simply too hard to believe. It didn't read like an authentic voice. I just finished reading ""The Lovely Bones"" by Alice Sebold, an author who can really write. In comparison, this book was VERY disappointing. It really reminded me of something an average teenager could write in their language arts class."
3,Schmaltz at it's best...,I read and really enjoyed James Patterson's book. I was given the book by a dear friend who just loved it and passed it on to me. I agree that the book does indeed impart some very heavy life lessons on what is really important in life and where our priorities should lie. My daughter lost her husband in his 30's to a heart attack 2 years ago and knowing what she has gone through makes this litany of learning a joy to my eyes and somewhat of a cathartic to my soul. You must pick up the shattered glass and move on with your life. I especially love the lessons of the 5 balls. What a classy way for the author to get is point across. Kudos to Patterson.
1,What a disappointment!,"I was expecting a sophisticated, deeply moving read. Instead, I found a book in which the characters were so superficially drawn that they were completely unbelievable. Although the story is based on events in the author's life, it is hard to believe that everyone was beautiful,and sensitive. That no one experienced genuine feelings of ambiguity or uncertainty -- the kind that every-day people experience. For me, the book felt like one big cliche."
4,A Romance with a Poetic Cadence,"Because I had not read any of this author's previous works, I had no expectations. I do admit that I was fearful it would be like some of Nicholas Sparks' recent books - but was pleasantly surprised. This is a delightful, well written, insightful book -perhaps a tad sappy, but kindly so - and the short chapters had a cadence that was almost poetic. A heartfelt kind of love story you might hope someone would write for you someday?"
1,An Easy Way to Make Money,"James Patterson must have needed a quick buck when he wrote this. It is derivative of many other romance novels, for instance, Message in a Bottle. Why does someone always have to die to make the story romantic? Can't living people enjoy romance too? I was sorry I spent my own money for this book and would warn others not to spend theirs on it."
2,a little too fluffy,"This book was a very quick read. It certainly tried to pull on all of the emotions, but I just found the whole thing to be your typical romance fluff. The ending was so predictable. If you normally read Patterson's novel and think you would like to read this as a change of pace, I suggest you skip it, unless you like weepy, emotional romances. I don't, and I certainly wish I would have spent my money on something else."
1,This is really a 0 star book,"I'm sorry this rating system does not have a zero star category because that is what this book deserves. What smarmy slop. It is predictable and totally uninteresting. Bland characters and a story so bland that I was actually hoping that Matt was a transvestite or something at the end to at least provide some surprise. This book, even at two hours of reading, is a total waste of time"
5,couldn't put it down,"this patterson book is not like any of the others in the fact that this was not in the mystery genre. but, as a mother of a 4 year old and specifically an 18 month old boy, this story hit home. i could not put it down. i honestly read it in one sitting. make sure you have your kleenex ready for this one!!!"
5,Suzannes Diary,"I have not been reading for some time for various reasons. While in Florida a few weeks ago a friend recommended this novel and I immediately found a book store and purchased one. I thought it wonderful, but sad. A good book just to get into and have trouble putting down. I am now going to purchase more of James Patterson, like tomorrow."
4,Touching,"I have noticed people either love or hate this book. As a mother of 4, I found this book to be moving. I looked at it from the perspective of a mother and found myself wishing I had the time and where-with-all to leave such thoughts and feelings for my children. Where some found this book sappy, I found it very emotional (I wish I could have some idea of what my own parents were like when they were young and in love). James patterson does a great job of turning this emotional memoir of a young mother into a very grasping story...well done"
4,A DIARY FOR THE ROMANTIC & CARING TYPE,"Even though other readers have downed this book I truly loved it. It might seem sappy or corny, but true love can be that. It's hard for an author to write a diary from three different points of view, yet James Patterson does a wonderful job of including emotions, details, and everything you would need to know about the characters to make you feel right there with them. Some parts want to make you cry and others parts you are overwhelmed with joy for the happiness of one of the characters."
4,First good book in a long time.,"I searched one day on Amazon to find a book. I am not an avid reader but for the heck of it and typed in my name Suzanne just to see what would come up. ""Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas"". I had seen it in the bookstore but never looked at it. When I received the book as I gift I immediately started to read it and was addicted. I loved how descriptive each character was. By the end of the book I felt as if I knew all of the characters. The ending was unexpected and it wasn't really that hard of a read. I would recommend this book to someone who enjoys romance novels. It won't take very long to read it but it is worth the time!"
4,"A charming & heartbreaking ""fluffy"" book","This is such a change of page for James Patterson. A totally predictable, but entertaining love story. I started reading this book at 11:30 pm, and finished 2 1/2 hours later - I couldn't put it down. It made me smile,and cry. If you're looking for a piece of fluff for a quick read, give this a try!"
1,A disappointment,"I read this book last night instead of watching summer re-runs on TV, and to tell you the truth, the time would have been better spent watching the re-runs. Seldom have I been more disappointed in a book. I've read some of James Patterson's suspense stories, and they held my interest to the end. It did occur to me that this was a bit of a stretch for him, but the hype given to the book stirred an interest in my romantic heart. I should try to remember that there is not necessarily any truth in advertising.I hate to think a tree was killed to provide the paper on which this book is printed. James Patterson should stick to the genre in which he has already gained a good reputation. Hopefully, he will quickly write another suspense novel with which we may wash away the taste of this story. This book would not have stood a chance of being published on its own merit."
1,Do not recommend buying this book.,This is the first book I have read by James Patterson and I wish I had my money back. I cant finish this book it does have a good storyline and could have the potential if written by another author such as Nicholas Sparks to have been a wonderful intriguing book but as it is it is extremely boring and mind numbing.
1,The Worst,"Recommended to me by a friend who clearly is a romance-book-lover. Insipid story, amateurish writing, completely uninvolving in every way. I guess there is a market for this kind of treacle but it isn't me. On the bright side, though I hated the book, at least it convinced me to finish my own. If a hack like James Patterson can make millions calling himself a writer, so can I!"
3,Bah Humbug!,I'm a cynical 54 year old man who has trouble believing that all of Patterson's characters in this book could exist. This was bizarre fantasy for me. Suzanne should be canonized tomorrow. I had trouble not laughing at the sincerity and sweetness in this book. Bah Humbug!... The most amazing thing is that James Patterson wrote this saccharine love story... Wow!
5,I Didn't Want to Read this Book,"I love Patterson and I have read most of his books. This book I was not interested in. My friend gave it to me one night and I picked it up and read a couple of pages. I was hooked! I couldn't put it down and when I was finished, I was sobbing. It was so moving. I still can't believe a man wrote this book, especially a man who writes such great stories about killing and kidnapping!!"
2,Predictable,"I was at the airport and waiting for my plane to board when I found this book. I have read a couple of James Patterson books and had just finished 1st to Die. I knew when I picked it up that it was not going to be a ""normal"" James Patterson book. I read it in about an hour. It was okay. Not great by any means. It got to be pretty predictable. When you started reading and you could tell that Matt was not ever going to cheat on his wife, you knew that something had to have happened to make him start dating Katie. Since I pretty well knew what was going to happen it made it boring. But it's nice to know that he can write something other than blood and guts."
3,Just OK,"Funny.... this book has all the ingredients of a Fairytale... and yet, in my opinion it just isn't one...I liked the plot... not a lot, but enough to keep me reading, but I really didn't liked or enjoyed the way the book was written. It seemed to me way too unrealistic... especially the way a mother would write to her child. It sounded just too objective and straight forward and so unpersonal, it simply didn't feel real.Also, the characters are, in my opinion, like cookie cut characters... flawless, beautiful, nice, good... too perfect....Still, I gave the book 3 stars because it does have some good advice, like the 5 balls of life theory, and it is a fast read with a nice, although 100% expected fairytale ending."
3,Very Predictable Love Story,"Although I read this book in one day, I was disappointed in the story. The ending was very predictable and the story was very sappy. If you like love stories, you will probably enjoy this, however, I was waiting for a good twist at the end that never came."
1,Contrived Pathos,"I gave it one star because it was a quick read, thank goodness. I would hate to think I invested any more time reading something so disappointing. Not 10 pages into the book and I already knew where this was headed. It's not believeable that a mother would write to her son in this fashion without the obvious being so obvious. It's hackneyed, haggared, and horrible. I want my money back!"
1,Tripe guaranteed to lower one's I.Q. by a point or two,"A member of my book club selected this book. Reading it was actually painful. The fine folks at Reader's Digest, Touched by an Angel and Chicken Soup for the Soul have nothing on Mr. Patterson. Thank goodness for the many blank pages that have been inserted to make this bit of fluff appear a little more substantial, and thank goodness for the 16-point font. Two hours wasted on this garbage were two hours too many."
5,What a wonderful change of pace!,"I have enjoyed all of the books that I have read by Mr. Patterson. In reading the jacket of ""Suzanne's diary for Nicholas"" I knew that it was going to be nothing like what I was used to from this author.This book was so quick to get involved with, and such a fast read, I was disappointed when it ended! I would have liked for it to go on and on, which I always think is an indication of a good book."
3,Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas,This is an amazing book however the download of it has alot of half word and typos when it shows up on your kindle. First time I have had a book that has done this.
5,a nice love story,"It's different from the traditional plot line of romantic novels. I'm a big Nicholas Sparks fan, and although this was different, it was an excellent addition to my collection."
4,Soulful Summer Read,"This is a wonderful way to wile away a lazy summer's afternoon. It reads quickly; even the slowest reader could get to the last page regretably in a few hours. A touching and meaningful story that will pull at your heartstrings.I was in the mood for a ""Bridges of Madison County"" kind of treat when I picked this book up and was not disappointed. ....A sweet series of memories with a story most realistic and honest.If you want something to cherish and invite your imagination, this is a story beautifully written with an intrigue of its very own. Patterson is best known for his interesting & mysterious tales. In its own way, this love story is exactly that and more."
1,This book reads like a bad movie.,"I was looking forward to reading James' new book; I liked his Alex Cross books (but I stopped after ""Roses are Red"" because I was disappointed) and I was hoping to enjoy ""Diary"". Unfortnately, I was disappointed once again. I couldn't care about any of the characters - they were too unbelievable and unreal. It's complete formula and I feel James has sold out to his readers. What a shame."
2,James Patterson or Nicholas Sparks?,"This could have been another one of Nicholas Sparks emotional and sappy stories. In the tradition of Message in a bottle, The Notebook, and The Rescue by Nicholas Sparks... James Patterson must have followed the formula for a predictable story. The characters were ""perfect"" with ideal professions and beauty.I had grown tired of James Patterson novels. However, since this one seemed out of his normal thrillers I gave it a chance. What a waste of money. Makes me long for Alex Cross!"
1,emotionally manipulative piece of [junk],"This book is padded with extra pages and an extra-large font in order to make it appear long enough to be worth your while. It's not. I skimmed through the whole thing in 20 minutes, because I knew from reading the first few pages that it was going to be pretty nonsubstantial. Well, that's OK. The frame-love-story was just pathetic, the new mommy's gushings were trite, and the tragic event I won't spoil for those who actually care didn't come as much of a surprise. However, when the other shoe dropped, I DID cry--but at the same time I realized how I was being emotionally manipulated. The whole climax of the book shows that the entire book was a set-up to elicit maximum tears from the reader. It worked. AND, the actual conclusion of the book was so LAME I threw the book across the room. The last time I did that James Joyce was involved."
2,I kept reading despite wanting to barf...,"I bought this book while on vacation, and literally read the whole thing while my fiance was taking a nap one afternoon. From the very beginning, I thought that the story was way too sugary and predictable. And the constant talk about Nicholas being the perfect baby, and Matt being the perfect husband, and life in general being just so wonderful and perfect... ugh, it was just too much for me. I gave it two stars instead of one because it did keep me reading. Within the first 50 pages, I thought I had figured out what happened to Suzanne and wanted to confirm... it turned out I was right.I agree with the reviewer that said James Patterson probably wrote this book on a bet, that he could write a Nicholas Sparks kind of book... he's probably somewhere laughing about all the money he's made."
5,A young lucky mothers perspective,"I read the first 14 pages of this book on line and new I had to have it. I asked for it for Christmas and got it. I read it the same night. I couldn't put it down. My heart is still aching for Suzanne and Nicholas and for their moments together. The magic she felt at seeing her babies smile or hearing his laugh. The terror she experiences at the thought of losing even a second with him, really makes you step out of your life and look at all you have to be thankful for. It gets so busy, so routine that you forget how precious our time here is, this book, this story, puts you back into perspective. I am thankful I read it."
3,Sappy . . .,"I bought this book when I was in the mood for some good story-telling. Since Patterson is a best-selling author and I'd enjoyed the movies based on his books, I thought I would give this particular book a try. My mistake. While it starts out pretty interesting, this book is just plain old sappy. I think that the main characters themselves are the most appealing aspect and, indeed, the saving grace of the book. They are likeable and realistic. However, the storyline just drones on after a while and the ending is cliche to say the least. If you're looking for a gripping book that will hold you until the last page, this is not it."
1,Started off with possibilities....,"I was really looking foward to reading this book. I heard mix reviews. I read the book in two days. I was really hoping it would get better, instead it got sappy. It wasn't lucky that I bought this book."
3,Fails to live up to Patterson,"James Patterson is widely known for his heart-pounding suspense novels. However, with ""Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas"" he tries his hand at a romantic book. A romantic-suspense book nonetheless. The story of a woman's search to find out what happened to her boyfriend through a woman named Suzanne's diary, it does leave you speechless at the end, and racing to get to it. You want to know what happens! That is Patterson's style. But if failed to live up to our expectations for a Patterson novel."
4,"Fast-Paced, Engaging...","From the first page of this un-Patterson like novel, I couldn't put it down. A devout Patterson fan for years, Suzanne's Diary is a wonderful escape from the author's typical mystery genre. The story of a much-loved wife and her family, I was touched by the love abound in this family. I was also touched by Katie, the jilted lover, and her response to the diary Matt has her read upon ending their 11-month relationship.A quick read, worth the effort."
2,too sticky sweet,A quick read- but I could've gagged on the sweetness- this is my first James Patterson book- I know that this is not the norm for him. Good thing.
1,Diary in a Bottle,"In this case, you can judge a book by its cover - or at least by its size. A slim volume holding a slim, insubstantial tale. After writing a series of unique and popular thrillers, Mr. Patterson has decided to rework the story of Message in a Bottle. Why would an author with hi$ own con$iderable following $witch to this mindle$$ romantic drivel? He $hould be embara$$ed!"
2,Different for Patterson but......,"While I am a fan of the author and appreciate the fact that he is branching out, I found this novel to be just a little too corny. I can also enjoy a well written love story, which this tries to be, but after finishing this book in one day, I felt as if there could have been much more. Somewhat predictable."
3,Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas by James Patterson,A widower's deceased wife writes this diary to her little son and how much she is in love with her husband. He send the diary to the woman who is in love with him and is pregnant with his child. I just found the story far fetched.James Patterson let me down!
1,So-o bad,"Patterson's latest is his worst yet. I knew not to expect his usual, but this is beyond the pale. It reads like a serial in a woman's magazine. I can't help but imagine he, or someone close to him, has suffered heart problems and this self-serving, maudalin tripe is a result of reflections on that. I cannot believe the professional reviews. This is not merely lighthearted or breezy--it's just poorly developed and written. Where are Patterson's editors? Once you become a big name is there no one who will tell you when something needs a lot more work?"
2,SAP!,"Is it just me or does the character Suzanne sound like a 13 year old most of the time? She's sweet, yes, but for someone who supposedly has been through so much, and is an intellegent doctor, she really lacks depth. I hate to trash anyone's hard work. It was a sweet love story, just not a very realistic one. Wait until you can check it out of the library."
1,Garbage,"Not much of a plot; a central male character who is portrayed as every woman's dream (tall, dark, handsome, sensitive, understanding and good in bed) but who nevertheless dumps his girlfriend in an unbelievably callous way for no good reason, two central female characters portrayed as intelligent professionals - one of them a doctor - who nevertheless can't handle contraceptives; and the perfect baby, who sleeps thought the night at 2 weeks old!!!! (This last bit the most unbelievable part for me.) The library had it filed under 'Crime Fiction' and I was waiting for the sudden twist, so you can understand how disappointed I was when it turned out to be Mills and Boone rather than vintage Patterson. IÄm only giving it one star because 'none' is not an option."
3,Most critical part of the book was not written very well,"James Patterson foreshadows the cliche ending throughtout the entire book. Hello??? Why else would Suzanne be writing to Nicholas in a diary.The concept of the book was very sweet, although what I thought was the most critical part of the book, was not written artfully whatsoever. Patterson should have rewritten the Daddy chapter because it seemed as if this last and most important chapter was left to a fifth grader to write. It was not what took place in the chapter, just how it was written. Very disappointing."
3,An okay rainy afternoon escape.,"The story is somewhat predictable, and simple. That's not to say that when taken as such it can't be enjoyed in a couple of hours. I found it to be a quick read, that didn't take a lot of thought on my part. Perhaps if we had been given a chance to know either Katie or Suzanne I would have felt some sort of emotional stake in the story. As it was, so much time was spent fliping between the two, I never really cared that much what happened to them. At the end of the book I was still trying to figure out exactly who Katie was, what her past was and how she ended up where she did. It felt as if there is a really great screen play or a really good book in here somewhere. Sadly, for the most part I felt like I was reading a rough draft."
1,Too Sappy For This Author,I was expecting some more of James Patterson's Excitement. I was totally disapointed . It is a hoaky and predictable love story.I did not feel connected to any of the characters. References to Ally McBeal Maybe he should write for Harequin Paperbacks!
5,You can't put it down.,I wasn't sure about a romance written by an author that does mostly murder mysteries and thrillers....but this was a great story. I had to spend a whole day reading it because I couldn't put it down. I enjoy Nicholas Sparks...and this was very similar to his style of writing. I would highly recommend it! The other one to read is Sam's Letters for Jennifer.
1,Sickenly Sappy,I am listening to this book. Probably one of the most predictable stories I have ever read. Can't stand the reader's voice. Being a mother - these characters soooo unbelievable. Everything is just too perfect . . . the references to everything - (Kennedy weeding) were too trendy. Sounded like the author was writing and dropping names for his Vineyard friends. Our book club chose this and I could not recommend it to anyone. I think the author just wanted to make a quick buck. Thank you God - I got it out of the library and didn't waste my money. Formula novel - make them weep and rake in the dough. Don't waste your time!
3,"Average, predictable","This is the first James Patterson novel that I have read and expected much more. The writing is very simple and the story is very predictable. The author did not develop the characters enough for the reader to feel any emotional attachment, and therefore the reader is undisturbed when the characters are confronted with joy or tragedy. If you're looking for a touching love story, I recommend either Message in a Bottle or the Notebook by Nicholas Sparks."
5,Fabulous!,"This book was excellent! You'll be sure to read it in the matter of hours, I simply couldn't put it down! Excellent read, although its very different from anything you'd expect from Patterson!"
4,"A compelling, emotional roller coaster!! Couldnt put it down",This novel plays like a well tuned guitar. I was rivoted to mycouch for one day and didnt put it down till it was finished.The diary entrances from a mother to her son is so emotionallycompelling and draining. This is not your typical Patterson novel--kudos to him for being able to bring out such strongemotions. This is a must read.
2,Awful,This is a very sappy book. The charactersare one dimensional and the relationships arecompletely unbelievable. It is a very easyread but is not worth spending your time andmoney on.
4,A Sweet Love Story,"I just finished reading this book at the beach. What a sweet, sweet story. I cried and cried, and so loved the characters. Have also read and greatly enjoyed The Notebook and Shade of the Maple this summer. Get your Kleenex ready!"
1,Drivel,"This was a very formulaic novel, which will no doubt earn its author a great deal of money. Trite, already done, not terribly complex. An easy, quick read, but found myself gagging throughout much of it."
2,Read something else -- ANYTHING else!,"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas is one of those rare, exceedingly bad books that I managed to finish. What's so bad about this book?1) It's only one step above Dick and Jane. The simplistic writing style grated on my nerves.2) Even the most inattentive reader could plainly see that The Perfect Man (Matt) would never cheat on his wife, and therefore any reader could easily predict the outcome. Excessive foreshadowing insults readers' intelligence.3) Suzanne's and Matt's level of optimism and happiness was so far off the charts that they were completely unbelievable characters. ""Aren't we lucky?"" Psychotic maybe.4) The fact that Suzanne described her sex life in her diary to her baby made absolutely no sense.5) Patterson's use of pop culture references was excessive, lazy, and purposeless.All that criticism aside, I finished it, so it's not the worst book ever written. Top 10 maybe. (Or Bottom 10, in this case.)"
1,Possibly the worst book I've ever read,"I find it hard to believe this book makes people cry. I couldn't keep from rolling my eyes, cringing and groaning throughout. Completely unrealistic. Unsympathetic characters. Stupid ""twists"" (the two Matts -- give me a break). Like a previous reviewer, I have never written an online review, but I feel compelled to do my part to save people from this book. I'm not opposed to a romantic ""tear-jerker"": ten years ago I sobbed uncontrollably on a bus while reading ""The Bridges of Madison County."" But THIS book, well, take your pick of adjectives: cheesy, schlocky, sappy, stupid. In a word: bad. (And not the good kind of bad.)"
4,light and easy,"This was very light and easy reading and definitely a page turner, not to mention the life lesson you get of what's important in life. I found myself trying to guess what was going to happen, as did the narrator of the book. I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone that wants a quick enjoyable read."
1,"Oh, please.","I'm sorry -- this is someone's work. It came out of a personal experience. But it stunk. I know this is the type of book to be hailed as a great love story, a 3-hanky tear jerker, with just oodles of depth and human emotion. It'll most certainly be a reading-group staple. It's simply awful. It's loaded with cliches, characters that are simply not to be believed -- down to the baby. Even HE was idealized to the point of making the reader think, ""oh come ON now,"" when you'd read something. But honestly, I think I could have stomached this more if it weren't for the wink. Gag. At least the main character didn't wear sandals, or have his shirt constantly tacked to his body with his manly sweat. I'd say,skip it. There are better fluff books to take to the beach, that are plain old fun."
1,"In a word....""pap""","Honestly, this reads like dime store romance novel. Each character is perfect in every way...save the predictable tragic death(s). Each is beautiful, sensitive, intellegent, talented, from wealthy backgrounds, yadda, yadda, yada. Even Suzanne can't help but compliment herself repeatedly throughout her diary. She breaks her arm patting herself on the back about how ""lucky"" she is in every way. Even the baby is ""perfect"". Suzanne happily calls him ""showoff"" when he holds a bottle at 2 months, rides around on the back of her bicycle at less than a year, and speaks numerous words before his first birthday. Give me a break. My teeth hurt."
1,It was unappealing,"I read this book with dismay and increasing disappointment as the plot meandered. I have read other books by this author and found them interesting and enjoyable. This book, however, missed the target. Although the story line might have gone somewhere, it didn't and quickly became indigestable nonsense. You wanted to care for the characters, but you were not led there; they and the story were very superficial. The ending was predictable and unappealing. I would be very careful in selecting other books by this author."
2,Disappointing,"I promised myself I'd never pick up another James Patterson novel after reading the ridiculous ending in ""Roses are Red."" However, I decided to give him one more chance with ""Diary."" This book is a cross between ""Bridges of Madison County"" (which is actually referenced in the book) and ""Love Story."" Sappy, improbable, and at times, it seems that the author has not paid attention to what he has written. For example, Suzanne frets about telling her lover that she recently had a heart attack. Evidently it doesn't occur to her that, during their lovemaking, he has probably noticed the scars from her recent heart bypass surgery. After years of reading Patterson novels, I hate to say it, but this book was a huge disappointment."
3,The Once in a Lifetime Love...Twice,"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas was a great novel to immerse oneself in on the weekend. The writing is clear and the plot is both engaging and captivating.Meet Katie, she has fallen in love with the perfect man. However, she knows that there is a past that he has not reconciled. When the relationship begins to grow, Matt decides to end the relationship. Without a word, Matt leaves Katie a diary ~ the key to his past.The reader is with Katie every step of the way as she makes her way through the diary and gets a picture of all that Matt is and all that holds him back. Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas is a feel-good story about finding true love.Congrats to Patterson for taking a risk and jumping out of his normal realm - job well done."
1,Much ado about nothing,"This is the worst book I have read in years. The characters were one-dimensional and full of self pity. The book itself was flat like day old soda. If I ever hear the term ""isn't it lucky"" again it will be too soon.Patterson should stick to writing mysteries."
4,So completely moving..,"There have only been 2 books that have openly made me cry- this one and The Bridges of Madison County. This is story is so moving, and wonderful. To understand that the author wrote this book based on true events from his life is all the more compelling. I couldn't put this down, I read it in one day. We all hope to someday have the love that Suzanne and Matt shared, and to extend that love to a child. The trials and devestation that this family goes through, and to imagine reading this as an outsider about the man you love, is just amazing."
2,What a Disappointment!,The premise of the story was good enough but this book was way too syrupy for me. My suggestion - don't waste your time reading this one!
2,"Too Syrupy, Too Predictable","This is definitely not the worst book I've ever read - but it certainly isn't one of the best. ""Suzanne's Diary..."" too often reads like the smarmiest of self help books. Every page is packed with cloying life lessons, cliched explanations of joy or sadness (""...happiness flooded our hearts and every room of the beach cottage. It came like the high tide on a full moon""), and enough warm sentiment to make you gag. The whole book is designed to warm your heart and change your life - but goes about it in such a way that you feel like it's being shoved down your throat. The worst part is how predictable the book is. From page one it is easy to see exactly where the story is going, and Matt's ""secret"" about his past with Suzanne is not hard to figure out. I'm sure there are people out there who would love this book for the very qualities I just denounced - and in its favor I will say that the book is at least a very fast, light read. For me, it's just too much."
3,Suzanne's diary for Nicholas,"An enjoyable read that is very well written with one major flaw. I found this book to be SO predictable that it was almost as if I had read it already. (But it had just been released.) If you like Nicholas Sparks, this one's for you."
4,a genuine love story,"i thought this book was great. i loved the format and the unfolding of the story. i have to admit that i gave the book four stars instead of five simply because there were times that i knew that the book was written by a man and not a woman. for example, when suzanne found out she was pregnant with nicholas... she calls matt and tells him over the phone and asks him to bring home an EPT test so they can be sure. do women who are seriously in love really announce the birth of their baby that way?the story didn't make me cry, but i was compelled to keep turning the pages! not only did it make me want to check out martha's vineyard, but i am ready to taste one of patterson's thrillers now."
4,A great book....,"It is truelly an amazing book...Mr. Patterson is brilliant..you become involved with each characters pain and frustration. Although, I knew what the ending would be I still enjoyed the twists he added."
4,Take this one on vacation with you,This is a moving love story with two heroines and two separate stories which interconnect with each other. This book is an easy read and a good one to take to the beach.
5,A tearjerker,"I honestly started crying when I read this book. It was really good, and very sad. A hearfelt, warm, touching story about love and loss. I highly recommend it, except again, a warning, not for people who hate sad stories. Because I needed a box of tissues!"
3,"Will the real James Patterson, please stand up!",James Patterson was trying too hard on writing a love story.What happened to the James Patterson that we all love and enjoyreading?
1,Easy & Cheesy.,"What a surprise! I have expected more from a well-known novelist. This book reads like a Harlequin Romance. It is overly simple, completely unrealistic, as if the author wore pink shades while forming his characters. Everybody in the book is too perfect, all the relationships are so melodramatically wonderful. The book is an easy cheesy read that's for sure but has no literary value!"
4,Great book,"Katie has found a man who she feels she is in love with! She thinks he feels the same, but lately he has been acting alittle strangely and she hasn't seen him. One day he hands her a diary and leaves. As she is looking over the diary she reads that it is a personal diary from a woman named Suzanne for someone named Nicholas. While she is reading the diary she realizes that the man in the diary is Matt, her man who she is in love with. She reads the diary and starts to understand the man she is falling in love with. But why did he send her this diary to read, it is very, very personal with entries in there that shouldn't be read by anyone except the person it is written for.Reading the entries in the diary and reading the story you get the feeling that you are truly reading someones private information. This book takes you right to the room where Katie is reading the diary and feeling the emotions that she is feeling.I recommend this book to anyone."
2,Will The Real James Patterson Please Return,"Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas is a sweet love story, but it's not another Bridges Over Madison County which was a GREAT love story. The book was simply confusing and not at all worthy of Patterson at his best. Matt is the central character, who in the beginning has apparently broken the hearts of two women...Suzanne and Katie, the woman he has been having an affair with. As the ""diary"" unfolds we learn more of the gushy details of his life with Suzanne while Katie the most current girlfriend agonizes over his past. The ""romantic"" ending makes Matt look silly and transforms a good guy into a real sap.Please bring back Alex Cross and a wonderfully suspenseful series that James Patterson brought to life for his readers."
1,Rubbish from Pollyanna Patterson,"If there were a lower ranking of 1 star, I would assign it to this waste of paper and typesetting. Call me a literary snob, but this junk was insulting to the intellect of anyone over the age of six."
1,Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas,"This is the worst book I have read in a long time. Sophomoric writing, cliques, end evident from the start. What a waste of time and money!"
1,Insultingly simplistic and predictable.,"I don't quite understand why people are crying, etc. over this. I found myself insulted by the story's predictability, as well as the format used by the author; Addressing every entry of the Diary ""Nicky"", etc. became irritatingly redundant and insulting."
1,Cheesy,"We read this book for our book club, and the only person who liked the book was the one who recommended it. The characters were not real - just a little too perfect. The author did a terrible job trying to capture a woman's point of view - his tone/style sounded the same whether he was writing the diary for Suzanne or Matt.The most positive comment from our book club was that this book gives hope to aspiring authors, because if it made it to the best sellers list, then they have a chance as well."
1,Dont waste your time,"I am not sure why or how this got published - it is boring and sappy. I dont think I will ever buy a patterson again. The number of times this book has the words ""lucky"", ""happy"", ""love"" is unbelievable. I would rate this a zero if I could."
1,'Unlucky' Sappy Drivel,"One star only for how 'luckily' short this book is. I got queasy from the unbelievable sugar-coating and smarm. And unbelievable it is. Not based in reality, and certainly no depth. I bought this book based on the Today Show interview and was expecting to be moved or at best, entertained. Neither happened. This is not a thinking womans read, nor a sensitive mans 'time well spent'. Save your money. Wait for the made-for-T.V. late night movie when you have a bout of insomnia. It should clear up by the 3rd commercial break. Ouch!"
5,Great book!,"This is such an awesome book, but yet it is so sad. I love the love story in it, and there are bits of other things thrown in as well. This is a great book, but keep a box of tissues nearby!"
5,absoluutly wonderfull!!,"i loved this book! i just finished it, took me only 6 hours it read very easily, it was touching, happy and sad. it definetly has me view my life differently."
3,"A Great Love Story, But Nicholas Sparkes would do it better","It was a very sad story (the diary part) with a happy ending (for the person reading the diary). Patterson's style is very sappy & choppy. I enjoyed the book, but a note to Mr. Patterson, 'You are not Nicholas Sparkes!' (Sparkes writes beautiful, enriched love stories IMHO)I'm waiting for a follow-up to ""1st to Die"" and your next Alex Cross novel ""Violets are Blue""."
1,Overly sentimental,"This book is predictable, sappy and way too long. Use your time reading something else."
4,Through the Eyes of Love,"This book is truly a love story from front to back. I loved the book and recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good,mushy love story.It was easy reading and can be read quickly.Some reviews have stated that the characters in this story were too good to be true. I disagree. Suzanne, Matt and Nicholas and Kate may have not been perfect people but in each of their eyes, they saw no faults in each other. The old saying ""Love is blind"" is so true in this book.The book ended the way I wanted it to end. I sort of expected the outcome to be as it was."
2,"...5 stars for the concept, 2 for the book","I have to admit...this book was a real let down. The idea was fabulous, five star. I looked forward to it for months. Unfortunately, the book was too poorly written to do the story justice.The diary was totally unbelieveable (how many of us refer to our spouses by their names, when speaking to our children, rather than by ""Daddy"" or ""Mom""? Patterson does this through the whole book). As well, Patterson writes the story with a real male (forgive me guys...) lack of feeling. At no time did I feel any sorry for the anyone in the book, as I never really saw them as people. These two very huge issues left the book unsatisfying and almost boring.Again, I thought the subject was terrific and could have been done very, very well....best seller material. But, I truly feel I could have written a better version (which is not saying a whole lot)...but I really would have loved to read the book had it been written by someone really good, like Lavryle Spencer."
1,Icky poo,"This was a saccharine, annoying book. I got the underlying meaning of cherishing every single second of every single day, but don't make me nauseous in the process! I brought this book on vacation with me and it took me only a few hours to get through it. All I can say is yuck - I can only stand so much syrupy, sentimental goo."
4,touching,"I have never read a book by James Patterson, but I felt this was a tear jerker. It was moving and heart wrenching at the same time. I would definetly recommend it. It is an extremely quick reading. I was engulfed in each character."
5,James Patterson wins again,"I have always been a avid reader of his books and this one just proves James Patterson can write in a completely different vien.I found the book one of those read at one ""sitting""books."
1,Don't waste your time or your money.,"Cheezie book!!! How dare James Patterson make reference to Bridges of Madison County and use the beautiful and trajic love story of John Kennedy and Jacqueline Bisset Kennedy to sell this shallow nothing of a so called novel. If offends me for him to try to equate this with ""Bridges"". Not even in the same galaxy!!!"
5,Once you start you just can't stop!!!,"This book was absolutely amazing. I can't believe James Patterson! He was able to capture the true feelings of a woman...not an easy task! Throughout the entire book, I found myself in awe of his ability to speak the female heart. This is one of those books I just had to finish. I couldn't get to the end fast enough. What a sweet, crazy, twisted, romantic, heartfelt story! The writing was carefully planned out and I would recommend this book to anyone...without hesitation!"
4,"Corny, but touching","A big departure from Patterson's normal fare, Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas was a touching love story. I found myself thinking ""no man can be this perfect""; however, reading something positive and uplifting about men was a nice change from the lieing, cheating, and irresponsible ones we normally find in relationship stories.I found the term ""aren't we lucky"", or ""isn't that lucky"" to be a bit overused, and it made the novel corny in parts. However, the story was a fast read and entertaining, and our book club overall enjoyed it."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book was horribly written. After reading the first 10 pages, I knew it was going to be terrible. I finished it just because I wanted to know how it would end. It was an okay story line, but terribly written. I could not believe that James Patterson even allowed this book to be published. He should be ashamed. It was written only for the money, and he is obviously making money from it, but I would be embarrassed to have my name attached to such a terrible piece of writing. I have loved his other novels and was shocked at the lack of quality in this novel."
1,sappy beyond belief,"It must be my age,but I know no men like Matthew and quite frankly I am glad I don't. I love sensitive men but this guy is just too much. I also figured out the book by the second chapter. I read it all for a bookgroup discussion; out of 30 of us ,of ages 20 thru 78, only one liked it and she was 20.I was also thouroughly sick of poor Susannah and could not believe she'd write love scenes for her son to read later. Not many people want to know about their parents' love life. I love my children immensely but would never gush over them as she and Matt did. I am assured by my sons,both of whom were suckered into reading this book also, that they were glad I was ""normal"". Oh well, to each his own. I am glad James P. s getting some good reviews for his new genre. I do enjoy most of his work."
2,If You Like Nicholas Sparks~You Might Like This,"I know James Patterson has been receiving some acclaim for stepping outside of his normal genre & I know that the inspiration for this story is based on his own personal loss of love. However, that is the only reason I can come up with to give this novel 2 stars. I'm all for a sweet romance, but this was too much. The writing was too syrupy and the ""pop culture"" references were corny. I found it tacky that he used JFK Jr & Carolyn Bissette Kennedy as the means to which his main characters met one another. If you are a fan of Nicholas Sparks writing, you may enjoy this one, but both are a little much for me. I really wanted to like this one, because the concept the novel was written in was clever (as a diary) and the story could have been a tear jerker, but I didn't get to feel for the characters."
1,James Patterson Lets Me Down Hard!,"I watched with anticipation a TV interview with Patterson on his latest novel, Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas, and bought it. I have long read and enjoyed his suspenseful crime novels. Now I realize this was a departure. But I found it to be sophomoric, soapy, deadly dull, altogether a very disappointing read. I felt suckered in and resented it. I hope to save others from getting ripped off. Save your money and wait for his new release coming out this fall. Truly, it could have been written by a student assistant (might have been). I started to just abandon the story, but decided to stick it out to the bitter and predictable end. Sorry."
3,Good book but not great,"Nice, easy book to read. Sort of drags on at one point but is at least interesting enough to keep you reading. The ending is a slight surprise but sort of a disappointment at the same time. I think Mr. Patterson had a nice idea with the storyline but it seems as though even he got tired of the book by the end and just wanted it over with."
5,James Patterson won my heart with this novel.,"In a sort of Nicholas Sparks style James Patterson writes Suzanne's Diary to Nicholas as a compassionate love story. Katie Wilkinson, a book publisher in New York, falls in love with Matt from Martha's Vineyard. She met him when she became interested in his poetry and wanted to publish his works. Just when Katie is about to tell Matt she's pregnant he leaves her with only a diary. This diary is Suzanne, Matt's first wife, writing to their newborn son Nicholas. I feel that any women that want to have children or do have children will feel deep compassion for these characters. I can tell you that the end of the novel was perfect. A good tearjerker with a nice ending."
3,Predictable!,"by Emily Placido, author ofJulita's Sands: A MemoirThis story is out of character for Patterson who is known for writing mysteries. Purely a love story with many emotional turns, the premise is that a woman is given a diary to read by her new lover. I really enjoyed reading the diary of a young mother to her new born son. Patterson's writing is terrific as it brings out the sentiments beautifully. The twist, is that the man who gave the woman the diary is the husband of the young mother. I like the storyline very much, but it was a little too predictable for me. Apparently James Patterson wrote this from his own personal experience of losing a woman he loved but finding a new life and love with someone else. As I read the story I felt like Patterson was trying to imitate Nicholas Sparks, who would have made this a much better book! I would really have liked to see Nicholas Sparks write this story instead."
3,Touching,"James Patterson is another very well known author who I've never read. Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas is probably not representative of most of Mr. Patterson's works but was written from his heart.If you're in the mood for a touching love story, this is just the ticket. Matt is the guy every woman dreams of falling in love with, kind, caring, calm and cute. Suzanne was the doctor on the fast track when her health forced her to find a simpler life. That's how she found Matt. And then came Nicholas. Dear, sweet, Nicholas.Katie also falls head over heals for Matt not knowing anything about his past. Matt leaves Suzanne's diary on her doorstep when he's unable to tell her himself.This story also contains heartbreak that will bring tears to your eyes. But the power of a new love can heal all wounds.I rate Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas a 3 out of 5. It's a nice, sweet, fast summer read perfect for beach or to relax with.Linda C. WrightAuthorOne Clown Short"
4,Ever want to peek at someone else's diary??,"Being this was the first novel that I've read by James Patterson, I had no expectations biased by his previous works. However, I was greatly impressed by this easy and quite emotional read. So much so that I'm interested in reading other books by this author. The story was a great concept and kept the reader guessing from one scene to the next where the diary was leading. While the main character, Suzanne, seemed a bit too sappy at times and her view of her love interest, Matt, a bit too perfect at times, it was an enjoyable story nonetheless. I received this book as a Christmas gift, and would highly recommend it for anyone else to give as a gift to a loved one."
3,Not your standard James Patterson,"I got this book thinking I could use a little romance these days. I found it in this book. It IS romantic. Katie's lover, Matt, breaks up with her unexpectedly, sends her Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas and Katie begins to read. The story that unfolds draws you in...but it's easy to see how it is going to end from the first few entries in this diary. All the classic signs are there.But the story makes your heart soar at times. Even though I personally feel that it was a little over the top (no man on earth is like this guy), it was a book that really took me away from reality for a while...and that's not so bad these days.Buy it, set it aside, and read it in the bathtub, or one night when you are feeling a little blue. Just finish it when you are in a better mood!"
4,kathy@caringonline.com,"I was very surprised with Mr. Patterson's new book. I am an avid reader of mysteries and romances. I would recommend for anyone that likes Nora Roberts, Julie Garwood and Barbara Delinsky - that this is an excellent read."
4,Morgan Vs. George?,"I loved Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas. I read it all the way through without putting it down. After reading all of James Patterson's books since Kiss The Girls, I have pictured Morgan Freeman as the hero but this one, was George Clooney or Tom Sellick for sure. Great Book!!!!!"
3,"""Let's appeal to the average American housewife""","While watching an ad for this book on a morning talk show, I was intrigued to see that the writer himself was endorsing the book by reading it to the camera. I was touched. Surely this would have to be an incredible read. I purchased it almost immediately and read the entire book in less than a day. This book is not worth the byline of Tom Patterson. I believe he was writing in a genre he was clearly not comfortable in and, quite frankly, the predictable nature and cliche catch phrases bored me to tears. Perhaps Harlequin Romances would have snatched this up in a minute. I firmly believe that if the author was not well-established the book would be cage liner for an editor's parakeet. Wait for the paperback, or better yet, snag one at a garage sale. Save yourself [the money] - you'll thank me for it."
2,"Cor ny, cor ny, cor ny!","Although this book did keep some interest to read it fairly quickly; I still thought it was the corniest book I ever did read. It is about a mother writing to her son, a mere baby; yet she is writing about the first time she and his father were passionate. What child would want to read about their parents doing that?????? He continually wrote one particular line: Suzanne, Nicholas, and Matt forever. I felt like I was reading some highschool yearbook. I couldn't get over the fact that a man wrote all this mushy nonsense. The only reason I did not give this only one star was because it wasn't completely boring; just not very good either. I do not recommend this book unless you enjoy a dorky kind of mushy goofy romance."
1,Will the real James Patterson please stand up!,"Wow! I bought the book for my Father-in-law who has been reading James Patterson books for the last 2 years. Maybe to kill 3 hours and while away my time before a 12-hour flight back to Manila from Paris, I pored through the book knowing the popularity of JP books, some of which I saw on film. I finished the book in 2 hours and realized in the end that it was a waste of time. I should have slept in the airport lounge and could have come out fully rested. First, the storyline was not original. Second, the names were very confusing, 2 Matts in one book???? Third, what's with all the italicized words? Fourth, what happened to Children Rhymes and limericks of love for titles? I really believe Mr. Patterson submitted his daughter's work to his editor and got away with it. tsk tsk tsk. I don't think I will even give it to my father-in-law who I love so much. I might get his ire...."
2,"Good while reading, hated it afterwards","I enjoyed the writing style of this book. It was easy to follow, (except for the two Matts). I did find it a bit confusing as to why Matt would leave Katie. Did he know she would come find him after reading the diary?? I stayed up late into the night to finish, and I was so depressed I coulnd't even go to sleep. Why write a book like this and then end it that way? To me it was very depressing. And that last line.... ""Isn't it lucky""... well, not for Suzanne and Nicholas."
1,Not My James Patterson or it is a copy,"I read this book over 5 years ago and it was not by James Patterson, but Nicholas Sparks. It is his style of writing and definitely not James Patterson's.I bought the book and I remember it has Nicholas Sparks's name on it unless he has one with a similar name. What is up with this?"
1,Patterson sold out,"Is there a writer out there who went down hill as fast as Patterson? His first five or six novels were page-turners; I bought them the day they showed up on the bookstore shelf. Then he sold out and started writing fluff like this. That was bad enough, but to add insult to injury he decided to let people trade on his name. Why do writers do that? Why does Patterson let people put their name on the front cover of a book so that an unknown can sell a few copies? Is it to put some extra money in his pocket? He's got more money than God so that can't be it. It makes no sense. I'll never buy another book that he writes or has ghost-written. He's everything that's wrong with novelists today"
5,Loved it. If you want to trust in true love you will love it also.,This is a great book on love. It was well written. It is more for the lover of the family. I know my husband would hate the book because it is just to mushie for him.This is the first book that I read of Patternson's and I have fallen deeply in love with it.Those who gave this book a bad review would more than likely give any love story a bad review. I think they are just upset because Patterson took a hard right and wrote out of his norm.If you like a great love story then this is the book for you. But do have a box of tissues ready. :)
2,Rather Cheesy and Predictable Love Story,"I could see how lame this book was going to be after the initial couple of chapters. I could also predict the ending with more precision than any other Patterson novel I've read. Not that there weren't some nice twists and turns in the middle, but the book was just plain nauseating. I lost track of how many times Suzanne mentioned how happy and perfect everything was in her life.This certainly isn't your normal Patterson novel, so proceed with caution."
1,Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas was a let down.,"I have read many of James Patterson's books and have enjoyed them very much however I was very disappointed with this book. This book was short and easily read in two sittings and (not that I like long drawn out stores), throughout the book I had the feeling that it was quickly written just to get another book published. The book also kind of irked me because it was filled with names of people and places that were dropped throughout the book with the attempted pretense of being ""cool"". The twists and turns that Patterson is usually expert in creating were dissappointing and predictable. The story was charming but I couldn't shake the feeling that it's been done before. Perhaps if I enjoyed reading ""romance novels"" I would have liked this book."
3,...Interesting,"This book didn't really amaze me or make me think WOW when I was finished reading it. In fact, I was very disappointed with the ending. The book started off so well and with such a romantic beginning, but slowly went down hill from there. Everything seemed so picture perfect in the beginning and it seemed as if Katie was living in a dream. Everything was fitting together like a puzzle and then it seemed like someone lost a few pieces or missed placed them at the end. I didn't really realize anything important or learn anything from reading this book. It was quick and easy and is a pretty interesting story, however, I would not recommend this unless you are just looking for something to read to pass the time."
2,Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas,"The paper cover of the book was in very bad condition; however the book itself was fine. It gave a very bad impression when I first removed the box from the packaging and appeared to be very ""beat up"""
2,Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas,I was bored. I skimmed through a lot of the book. Did not hold my interest and it was predictable.
1,insultingly simple and sweet,"First of all, I like his suspense books, and I like a good romance, but this book is a pathetic attempt to cash in on the Bridges of Madison County, Message in A Bottle type of book. Except that both of those books are much better! This is almost a collection of cliches and stereotypes...cardboard people with no real feelings, depth, or motivation for anything they do. I would say, pass on the book, and wait for the movie which will undoubtedly follow."
1,Hackdom knows no bounds.,"If he isn't busy killing off women with menace, now he's killing all of us with this syrupy, trite garbage. Patterson would be the first to tell us he's a serious writer, but put this in the heap with the worst of Danielle Steele and Jackie Collins. But hey, it's that time of year when his name has disappeared from the best-selling lists, and so here comes another work that took about 20 minutes to put together. Bridges of Madison County looks like a Nobel prize winner by comparison."
1,Absolute Drivel,"I bought this book because I read the great reviews : boy was that a mistake. I was robbed when I parted with my $ for this dreadful book. The story was a sickly sweet, sugary, bubblegum tale of pure drivel.I hung in there until the bitter end waiting for something to catch my interest but it never happened.If there were any tears to shed it was tears of joy that I had finally finished it !The most nauseating part in the whole book is when she refers to her baby son Nicky as ""Nickey Mouse""..oh please !I wish that instead of buying this book I had put my money towards a big slice of cake ..that is the type of sugar and sweetness that I do like to digest."
1,Not for real readers,"If you like to read books, don't read this one. As the prior reviews have stated, it is shallow, Hallmark-esque, trite, cliched, tired and dumb. The font size is huge and each chapter is about 2.5 pages long, it really does look like the age-old trick of trying to fill up pages for your High School English teacher.Go to a card store, browse the shelves, it will be much more rewarding!"
1,"simple, insipid, shallow","The book was highly recommend by a well-read friend whose judgement I had previously trusted. No more. What a disappointment and waste of time! Too many inconsistencies to mention here. What I found as off-putting as any of the cliche writing was the too-often mentioned place names, in both locales, Manhattan and Martha's Vineyard. It seems that the author was simply trying to fill the pages with words - forget about literary style!"
1,What a waste of time,"I read this book in three hours, and have never read a more sappy and poorly written book in my life. It reminded me of a love story I read when I was in the 6th grade; it sounded like a 6th grader wrote it. I have never read one of Mr. Patterson's books before, but know they are extremely popular. I couldn't believe that his writing skills were so poor - is this how all his books are written? And what is with his use of italics? Can't he get his point across without them? They show up every few sentences - very annoying. The storyline, although based on a true story, was so overtly mushy, was his point to depress readers? I was thoroughly disappointed by this book and am shocked to see it is selling so fast."
4,Approved by students,"I am a high school English teacher and purchase this book in August. Somehow, it ended up in my classroom library and my students love it! In fact, I haven't been able to read it because it's been loved by so many others instead. The first student who read the book had remarked just prior to opening it, ""I hate reading. It's so boring!"" Within a couple of days, she had changed her mind and now can hardly wait for silent reading time each day!(This book has been rated 4 stars only because I haven't read it personally and can not really attest to it's quality, although the students give it two thumbs up!)"
5,Fantastic book,"This was one of the sweetest books I've ever read. It's an easy read, but very touching. I've never thought of life as ""5 balls"", but it makes perfect sense."
5,Susanne's Diary For Nicholas,Unbelievable ! I did not expect the ending as it was written. I cried through half the bookbut loved it.
1,Gag me with a rubber-coated spoon,"This sappy story of love and tragedy has no basis in reality. It's written to totally manipulate your feelings, and it will probably elicit a tear or two from even a die-hard cynic, but why bother? Don't waste your time on this sentimental drivel."
1,A Shallow Hallmark Card,"This book is a shallow as today's bad Hollywood love stories. It's contrived and insultingly lacking in depth. His characters say things like "" Aren't we lucky? Life is so precious."" and"" Don't be a cynic... anything but that."" Page after page of corny, shallow diaologue and happy, happy people. The end had me laughing and that certainly wasn't the response Mr. Patterson was after. Mostly, I'm put off with how saintly Patterson depicts his heroine. I mean here is a diary that even in it's dark moments is sweet, loving and perfect. Anger doesn't exist in this diary ever. There is no PMS, no difficulty paying the bills, or stress of being a mother while working full time. I'll stick with Maya Angelou when I want a life affirming message from a woman. Maya at least comes from a real place, while Patterson's puts on a woman's point of view like a man dressed in drag."
1,Adolescent Treacle,"I found this book poorly written, transparent, pedestrian, and boring. I found none of the characters particularily sympathetic, especially Matt who I think is a bit of a wimp. I read it because it made my best friend cry and I had to find out WHAT had yanked her heartstrings. I am still wondering. I finished the book out of curiosity because I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. The ending was trite and quick,as if Patterson had fallen asleep too and wanted to get it over with. Yuck."
1,I was rolling my eyes by the end.....,"I thought this book was horribly predictable. The concept could have worked but the characters were transparent. If you are looking for light summer reading go with this book but it will go quickly, it is a real easy read. If you are looking for a well-written, thought-provoking book, do not go for James pattersons newest novel."
1,Bring Back Alex Cross!,"This has got to be the worst book I have read this year. Mr. Patterson, whose books I normally LOVE, has tried to write a romance novel a la Nicholas Sparks. The book goes back and forth between Katie (present time) and Suzanne's diary for Nicholas, whom we find out is Katie's boyfriend's wife and Nicholas is their son. Oh the angst, oh the unhappiness. Is it a tragic love story? Yes. Is there a happy ending? You'll have to read it to find out, however, I'd wait for the paperback or even just borrow it from the library. Nicholas Sparks fans may love this book, but that's iffy 'cause I liked Sparks first two novels and this is not up to par with those.I can respect Mr. Patterson for trying something new, but give it up! Go back to the thrillers!Thanks for reading! ~Pandora"
1,Creepy Much?,"This book is rubbish! Not to mention a bit creepy. What mom writes about her sexual encounters in a diary meant for her son? The characters were flat, annoying, and completely unrealistic. The plot was... nonexistent. And the amount of sappy, corny glop on each page made me want to retch. The book is going into the recycling bin."
1,One of the worst books I have ever read,"I usually don't write a review when I don't like the book. I just don't like to spend time writing negative things. But,I'm writing my very first completely negative review today. I read Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas out of curiosity because Patterson is constantly on the NYT bestseller list. According to the average stars, this book is supposed to be one of his best works. But, this is one of the worst books I have ever read!It's poorly written, very predictable, and overly sentimental. If it was written by somebody else, it would never have been published."
2,"OK, BUT NOTHING SPECTACULAR",I was expecting more. Entertaining at times. A quick read. This was my first James Patterson book. I understand he has some really good ones. I should have started with something else.
2,Nicholas Sparks-esque but not nearly as good,"I read this book on a recommendation from a friend and while the story was sad and at times, romantic, the whole diary format was a little irritating - who writes full dialogues in a diary? If Suzanne was truly keeping a diary, it should have been editorialized synopses of events rather than an exact play-by-play of every word spoken. And I don't know any mother who details past romances for their children - why would they care. I think that was the most annoying part of the book and I just couldn't past it. The story would have been better told by Nicholas Sparks - I didn't shed a tear and I am usually sobbing after every Sparks novel."
4,"Very good, hard to put down","I loved this book... however I found it to be a bit unbelievable that Suzanne would write some of the things she wrote to her son. Otherwise, it was excellent. I have passed it on to a friend who I know will enjoy it, too. I've never read any of Mr. Patterson's other books, but liked the overall style of this one. I could really relate to all of the characters, and felt the emotions of each one of them."
2,"Light, fun read, but not a *good* book","This book reminded me a lot of ""Bridges of Madison County."" It was overdone and corny to the max. The characters were oversimplified, not an ounce of complexity in any of them. Sure you like them, because there's nothing *not* to like. At the end I did cry, but felt manipulated. Bleh."
3,A new direction for Patterson,"Well, I have to say it wasn't what I was hoping. To be fair, I've read four of Patterson's previous books and I think he and his co-writer are working on a new direction. Didn't work for me."
4,A different Patterson book,"I read this book expecting typical Patterson, author of the Alex Cross series. This was totally unlike his others. I found this book kind of sappy, and could see where it was going from the start. That said... I could not put it down! I read this through the night, sobbing. Beautifully written, which nullifies the obvious story line. By another author, it could have been horrendous. By James Patterson, it was a book you won't forget."
2,I loved to hate this book or visa versa.,"Have you noticed people either love this book or hate it. I disliked it for many of the reasons already expressed; it is predictable and contrived with little in the characters to which I could be attracted. I read this book because a colleague of mine thought it was the best book he had read in a long time. Despite my opinion being diametrically opposed to his, I think it gives some insight into what people want in a sappy romance. We like beautiful, clean, well educated, empathetic people who can fall in love with each other. Unfortunately the wrapper in this case is as paper thin as its characters. I give it two stars only because there will always be large part of many readers including a small part of me who will be drawn inexplicably to this sort of 'novel by recipe' e.g. Love Story."
3,"Worth reading, but not worth buying the book","This book kept me interested for a fair amount of it. After a while it just seemed to be the same thing over and over again. It got quite boring in the middle. In the beginning I couldnt put it down. I recommend borrowing this book from a friend, but do not spend your money on it."
4,Very Captivating!,"I just finished reading the book in one sitting! I could not put it down. This was the second book from J.Patterson that I read and it was just great. He is a great storyteller... thoroughly building toward his surprising climax. Very well written... And, as expected, unexpected! A must read for all readers!"
4,sweet! so sweet!,"all i can say is that this is just such a sweet story! I couldn't put it down. i had to know what happened at the end, even though I kind of knew anyway. i think it was odd though that suzanne wrote to her son and referred to his father as Matt. why not refer to him as ""dad"" ? Also, why would she write a diary to her son and reveal her intimacies with Matt. I found that odd, yet still enjoyed the book immensely. i wonder if anyone else felt this way. It was way too sweet and everyone is so perfect in the book in an almost unrealistic way. It ended kind of quickly. i would have liked more details about Matt and Katie. I did really enjoy this book, despite some flaws."
2,disgrace of love,"Love between Suzanne and Matt is romantic and nicely narrated.But immediately after the death of Suzanne,Matt falls in love with Katie. This is not fair to his love for Suzanne. It is a disgrace to true love. Would give 4 out of 10."
1,too good to be true,"I was very disappointed in this book. I bought for an easy summer read but was wanting my money back by half way. First of all, why 2 men named Matthew? It is fiction, use a different name. Secondly, there is no one that perfect as the main male character. Matt was made out to be so perfect, it was not believeable. It was too sappy, and the ending, come on. Patterson should have left the child alone. She was the perfect mother, she wouldn't have endangered her child if she was that ill. And another thing....when Suzanne first slept with Matt. She didn't tell him about her heart attack...well wouldn't he have seen the scars from the bypass surgery? This one's going to the library book sale."
1,Nicholas Sparks-esque but not nearly as good,"I read this at the recommendation of a friend but just could not get into it - I found myself talking out loud about how ridiculous the diary format was - who documents entire conversations in a diary? It should have been editorialized synopses of events instead of an exact play-by-play of every dialogue spoken. And I don't know any mother who tells their children of past romances - why would they care. The story would have been better told by Nicholas Sparks - I didn't even shed a tear in this book and I am usually sobbing at the end of a Nicholas Sparks novel. I agree with other reviewers who felt the writing was elementary and overkill on the ""romance."""
1,"Dear Diary, What a waste of time I committed ...","...when I read this trite, silly, pointless novel written by a guy who apparently thinks he knows how women think. As usual, however, when his female characters think, they think about some guy and how wonderful he is and how they live to make him happy and he should live to make her happy on and on and on ...I haven't read anything this overwraught and predictable since I stopped reading short stories ... The woman is always rich and beautiful and tragically wounded. The man, also rich and beautiful and tragically wounded, acts upon his grief or anger by doing something hurtful to the woman who loves him. Then the story is some pablum about how she either finds happiness with another man or he comes to his senses and woos her back....If I could give this book 0 stars, I would. ..."
1,HAVE YOUR SUGAR LEVELS TESTED AFTER THIS!!,"Let me say I'm one of the biggest romantics in the world and I love a heart-wrenching love story but this book could almost be considered a satire on love stories. The only part that really brought me to tears is when the dog died. How predicatable was this story especially when you realized Suzanne had a heart condition? How else could it have ended? Could Matt have been anymore perfect? He reminded me of a charactor I created for a short story in Junior High. Besides the charactors that never developed, the juvenille and saccharin writing style, the absurd thought that a mother would write of her romantic escapades in a diary to her child, I think what bugged me the most was Patterson's constant name dropping. It really sent the shallow feel of this story over the top. This was a real disappointment. I don't mean to insult anyone, but those who say this is the best book they have ever read really need to expand their choices in literature."
1,Sickening,"The reader who said Suzanne's sappy letters to Nicholas were nauseating was right on the money! The book was way too consumed with these sickening letters and when Suzanne referred to Nicholas as ""Nickey Mouse"", that pretty much did me in.Boring, SAPPY and unoriginal!"
1,A Total Waste of Time,"Along Came a Spider was so great.James Patterson should stick to what he knows best.I really tried to like this book. Howver, even though it took me a little over an hour to read, I had to force myself to finish itThe writing is soooo poor.Please don't waste your time and money on this dribble. Yech....."
4,"Simple, heartwarming reading","It's nice to read about a sincere, thoughtful, caring man who had such a wonderful life, and upon it being shattered, was able to pick up the pieces and begin again. The ""nice"" thing is that it is written by a man. The book is about human nature and dealing with tragedies life throws our way. Although the ending was predictable, since part of it is based on Patterson's life experiences, I'm glad he took the time to share a lovely story with us."
4,It's HuG -- Anthem Rock for your jisock,"Good Album, but what do I know? This album is 5 years too late. It sounds dated with all though metal guitars, but all in all good. Buy it if you like guitars. Avoid it if you don't. Do yourself a favor and look up metropolis records for better industrial. Metal heads will love this. Depeche Mode fans will cringe. Britney Spears fans will explode -- hopefully."
3,What are you looking for?,"If you are looking for a readable bio of Tokugawa Ieyasu in English, you have found one in Totman's. However, this is a rather lightweight historical work. Much of it was copied from a Japanese text, and the author admits this. Unfortunately, pickings on Tokugawa in English are slim. General works on Japan's 16th century are better. I recommend Boxer's The Christian Century in Japan, Elison's collection Warlords, Artists, and Commoners, and Sansom's A History of Japan: 1334-1615. They give a clearer picture of the times."
2,Disappointing to say the least,"I have no idea what book the other reviewers read, but they must have gotten a different version of this book than I did. The brief sections on Ieyasu's rise to power and ultimate appointment to shogun and leader of a unified Japan in more comprehensive histories, namely Sansom's three volume series, provide more background, information and insight than this book. Not only is this book the most basic of introductory works on Ieyasu, but the style in which it is written is meandering and, at times, confounding. The entire book is full of flashbacks that would have supposedly taken place in Ieyasu's mind from just prior to his ascension to shogun until his death."
3,Good introduction to Ieyasu,"I found this book to be an excellent introductory book on the life and time of Tokugawa Ieyasu, founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate which lasted for nearly 250 years. Since the author don't make any bones that this is just an introductory work, I am judging on his intent, which was just write a simple biography which will be readable and understandable to the English speaking population. I think he accomplished his goals quite admirably and anyone who have any interest in this man cannot go wrong in starting out reading this book."
3,Pretty small,"I bought this bag on sale based on other reviews. Unfortunately, like other reviewers said, the whole thing has to go in the freezer and ends up taking up a fair amount of space. Also, I can't even fit two 5-oz Born Free bottles in it and I can't fit one Tommee Tippee bottle in it, either. It's a good concept, just needs to be altered."
5,Awesome...,"I recently went back to work and it has been a life saver for storing my pumped milk. Especially, if you use the Lansinoh milk storage bags, you can get alot more milk in the freezer bag than the two 8 ounce bottles or three 4 ounce bottles. I highly recommend it. :)"
5,Best there is.,"My daughter has been formula fed from birth, at this point she's over a year old and we've used these bottle coolers every day since she was born. For everything from a trip in the car, to long overseas flights. It actually does live up to it's 12 hour promise. We kept 4 of her bottle ice cold when we flew overseas when she was 6 weeks old and didn't have to deal with the hassle of mixing powder on the plane as a result. Very convenient, I recommend buying two of them for two reasons: 1) if your child is formula fed or supplemented on formula and you go out for long periods of time, chances are you'll need more than 2 bottles (especially in the first few months) and 2) once they're toddlers use 1 of the bag to carry sippies/bottles of milk/formula/breast milk and use a second bag to carry snacks in such as yogurt, etc."
4,Alternative to ice packs.,"We purchased this to preserve baby food and milk during short drives and day trips into the city. We love the fact that we do not have purchase separate ice packs. The whole bag goes inside your freezer. You just take it out when your ready and the contents inside remain cool. We can't attest that it remains cool for 12hrs like the packaging states, but we've carried it around in the city for a good 8hrs and the contents are still cold. Only draw back is that if you have two baby bottles, there is no room for other things. Otherwise, it's a good product."
4,Does the job well,This cooler bag does keep your milk much longer than others. I don't mind putting the whole bag in the freezer since that is how it keeps the milk colder and longer than other cooler bags. I only wished that the bag was a little bit bigger. It'll fit 2 wide neck bottles but it's a snug fit.
3,"Great in the beginning, now disappointed.","I had high hopes for this product. The first couple weeks I think it worked very well - but now, I've had it for a couple months, and it does not stay cold. I take it out of the freezer at 7:30am, and by the time I get home after working and going to the gym (5:30pm) it has not kept my pumped milk cold enough. I'm currently adding another icepack to the inside, until I can find a better product.If you are not going to need it for more then 8-10 hours, then this is a great product for you. Anything over 10 hours is not going to keep it as cold as it should."
2,Not impressed...,"I wanted to love this product but I couldn't. It's bulky since the ice pack is built into the cooler. Like other reviewer says, you have to put this whole thing in the freeze. So, it's big and cumbersome (can not fit into a diaper bag really) and holds very little. Good concept since it does stay cold for a long time but just not efficient."
4,Haven't used it yet,"I haven't needed to use it yet, as my baby isn't here yet (8 weeks to go!!) but it appears to be good quality. A little on the small side, not much extra room for anything other than the bottles, but it should serve its purpose."
2,"Not sure, if it really last for 12 hours","Only fits for two bottles. I use it for night time storage. I don't feel it actually last for 12 hours. I put 2 bottles in the bag around 9-10PM each night. I usually warming the last bottle around 4AM each morning. I always hear watery sound, when I take the last bottle out of the bag. I guess the ice pack is already melted by then. This is inside a house with air conditioner on. I wouldn't recommend it, if you are planning to use it while traveling in a hot car or in a hot day outside."
1,No better than any regular cooler,"With an overseas trip planned and after reading all the positive reviews, I was excited to give this a try. I wanted to ensure that my breastmilk will get to our destination with no worries of temperature issues so I experimented with: 2 bottles of ice water in one regular cooler with regular ice packs (likeAmeda Cool 'N Carry Milk Insulated Storage Tote with 6 Bottles #17076, and 2 similar bottles of ice water in this Playtex Fridge-To-Go (after it was placed in the freezer as instructed), both placed in the same part of the house. Twelve hours had not even passed yet when I checked (after about 9 hours), the bottles in the regular cooler were cold while the ones in Playtex were nearing room temperature! What a massive disappointment.I will definitely be returning this item."
4,Pretty damn good,"I write this review here, because this is the version I have, but I will write it in the other one too, because that is where most of the reviews are.In short, this album is enjoyable. Is it different? Damn right, but its not. It really does sound a lot like Fear Factory, but its not predictable. Raymond's bass drum is not going 1000MPH every song, even though there is fast double bass and blast beats. BCB takes chances vocally, and it works most of the time, which I am grateful, because the same notes reverbed in EVERY FF song was getting on my nerves. The ""slow"" songs have an 80's quality to them. If you are expecting Demanufacture 2, you will find some of that on here, but overall its a damn good album. Please do not compare to the awful Digimortal."
3,"Beer, the basement and the blues","Apparently Im the only person thats heard of the Gibson Bros except for a few drunken weedheads in New Jersey. Well, I suppose you arent missing much. Sloppy blues and sound bits are the tools the Gibson Bros use. These are all, I believe, blues standards, none written by the Bros themselves. They absolutely destroy Bo Diddley's ""Roadrunner"" to good results, and the second side is them tearing up their instruments live with...Cristina Martinez and Jon Spencer! Hard to listen to unless you are really, really wasted, and in a grim mood, trying to figure out what the girls inside the booklet are doing...oh...they also list Mojo Nixon and the Unsane as bands theyd like to thank, so maybe they were cool, right?"
3,just OK,Bought one at bed bath and beyond a couple of years ago for my cats fur that was great. I thought this one was the same. It is not. its OK !!!
3,Check out the Sunbeam model before you buy!!,"Don't bother with this product. There are way too many negative reviews. Amazon also offers the same style from Sunbeam for only $5.95. Wish I would have noticed that before I ordered mine. When using this one, you must feel the brush to make sure that you are brushing against the grain, or you will end up with more lint/filth than when you started. I also had a problem with the plastic housing (on 1 side), that grabs the lint to store. That part broke off with just a couple of days use. I was able to superglue and tape it back on. Hope it last. Since I primarily use mine for animal hair, I wish it were made to be able to clean (wash)it better. It's almost impossible without getting water in the lint storage area."
1,Do not purchase,I have a 25 punds beagale that sheds everywhere like crazy. I was tired of spending money on the Scotch rollers so I decided to give this product a try. What a mistake! It does not work on pets hair at all. Big waste of money!
1,broke before i even got it..,"general stuff: came w/ the normal brush and a small travel version. delivery time was pretty good, but the shipping packaging was pretty beat up. the brush part is actually Red and not Black like the picture.pros:self cleaning works well.works fantastic on dog hair, but it does't replace the normal tape rollers.bonus travel version is nice to have.cons:feels really cheap. the plastic is flimsy and feels like it could snap at any moment.a little difficult to use because the brush part is flat w/ the handle and if you're using it on a couch, you may end up giving yourself rug burn.the reason why i'm only giving this 2 stars is because the lint trap door was broken when the brush arrived. the cleaning slide button broke the first day i used it, even though it works, it's difficult to do w/a broke tab. all in all, it works pretty good, but does not replace a lint roller."
2,Not as good as my original one!,This was definitely not the same lint wizard I had in my home. I ordered it for my mom because she liked mom and this one did not work as well.
4,ambersunshower making a name for herself.,"ambersunshower holds the dubious honor of arriving on the music scene shortly before the now-legendary erykah badu. while that distinguishes her as the true starting point of a recent musical renaissance that also includes adriana evans and lauryn hill, it also served to completely overshadow her debut album, _walter t. smith_. completely unique, it is inconceivable that this album could have been produced by more than two ways: 1) ambersunshower or 2) locking chaka khan, billie holliday and joni mitchell in a room together. the songs on _walter t. smith_ are each a rich tapestry with layers of complex lyrics, vocals and instrumentation. maybe as erykah badu takes a break from dazzling us with her old soul and deep spirituality, ambersunhower can release a follow-up album to knock us off our feet (again)."
2,"Very tricky ideas,watch yourself!",". Only for the most advanced facillitator. Many of these activities put people at risk, you better know how to handle this! Many of the ideas are old ""hat"" with a new twist, really nothing new. Something of a disappointment."
2,"Cheap, in every sense","Went into the Goodwill bag first thing. Flimsy, obviously too small and I could have gotten something better, a thicker, more substantive and flexible knit, (and later did) at a department store. I was seduced by something in the description (looking to fit someone w/ large calves) but I should have known better."
3,Try this one in a store before buying it here,"I bought this online, without trying it first in a store. The picture and sound quality were good, the size and the housing were nice. But the actual mechanisms were very loud - if you were using this in a quiet place, it would be very annoying both to you and anyone sitting next to you. Since I bought mine for plane travel, and didnt' want to bother ""the neighbors"" I returned it."
3,Portable DVD Player,"Don't try to take this portable dvd player on an airplane, bus, or train. Even with a headset, this device has a very loud motor that can be distracting to your neighbor. I kept it b/c the price was not so bad and I like to sit alone on trips anyhow."
1,Don't bother with this DVD player,"I thought I would give this model a try because of the low price. When I got it, it didn't work. Specifically, the screen remained black and would not play any video even though the DVD was whirring inside. I explained the situation to Amazon and they are going to cheerfully refund my money, plus shipping charges for the return. Because of the glowing reviews, I am going to buy the Panasonic instead and not waste any more time with this less expensive model.p.s., Received the Panasonic DVD player today from Amazon (February 3, 2004). Just as the reviews said, it is fantastic. So glad I substituted this Panasonic model for the cheaper brand. Well worth the higher price."
5,excellent value,"This is an excellent player. We originally purchased the 5.8 inch model which was also very good, however, the 7 inch screen really does make a difference in viewing. Picture is very sharp, sound is good, quality is solid. You really can't beat the value of this unit. Works great in the car to keep our 2 year old son entertained."
1,Constantly Freezes Up,"I purchased this DVD player as a Christmas gift for my son. It has been a problem since the second movie I put into it. Sometimes it never finishes loading and I have to shut off the power, pull the out the dvd and start over again. Other times it starts and then freezes in the middle of a scene. First few times a light tap on the cover would allow the movie to continue. The problem has gotten progressively worse until it is not worth using the unit. The company felt it was the dvd itself. After I mentioned that it was multiple dvd's and that they didn't freeze in the same place each time, the rep decided to have me return it for them to look at. If they feel that it is a problem with the unit, the best I can expect is that they will cover parts. I still have to pay for the repair. I would not recommend this player at all. Spend the money and get a better brand."
1,Great if you like silent movies,We purchased this player to take on a family vacation for my two children to watch movies while we made a 12 hour drive. We used it several times for approximately 2 weeks prior to leaving and loved it. An hour and a half into the trip we turned it on and there was no sound. No matter what we tried the sound would not come on. The kids were really bummed and it made for a much longer trip for them as they were greatly dissapointed. I refused to try another one from Initial and just got a refund. I am waiting on my Mintek to arrive.
4,Good Machine / Customer Service Stinks,"My wife purchase this player in Feb and have used on quite a few trips. At first it worked great and then it started to skip and freeze up. Most recently the power supply went bad. It is almost impossible to get throught to customer service, but when you do they are very good. Overall I am happy the the unit."
1,Freezes up,"4/30/05 - Bought this one month ago. This model did exactly what other reviewers said it would: it freezes up 2-10 minutes into whatever you're watching. You have to turn off the power in order to ""reboot"", and then it all happens over again. Tried several different DVD's, and it did the same thing. Worthless, is the best word to describe this product. I guess you truly get what you pay for. Features and accessories were nice, but those don't matter whatsoever when you can't actually watch anything."
5,Great item for the money!,"I purchased this dvd player as a last minute thing to try and avoid spending $1500 on an overhead player and it has been well worth the money. The first one we brought home had a problem with the screen cuting off but we decided to try it one more time and exchanged it. This one (so far)has had no problems. The screen is a perfect size and has great viewing from the sides which is no comparison to the other inexpensive models. The volume is plenty loud enough for the car and there is no problem hearing it even in the third row seats of an suv. It may be too soon to give it five stars but from what we have seen so far, the others fail in comparison in this price range."
1,Very disappointing Product,"I purchased the 7"" Initial DVD player before reading any reviews on it, now I wish I hadn't been quite so quick to buy a no-name brand. The picture quality is really excellent, but unfortunately I only got 15 second to 5 minutes of viewing in before it would freeze up. After 2 weeks of continually freezing, or refusing to load at all, it's back where I got it and I'm saving for a namebrand. Whatever causes these same problems in all these 1 star reviews is still going on, mine was fresh on the shelf when I bought it in October 2004."
1,It was neat while it worked (1 day),"I bought this for my wife for her birthday (3 days ago). We watched a DVD that night, in the dark and quiet of our house, and it was great! Small screen, yeah, but it was pretty neat anyhow. She watched a DVD in the car the next day, the sound was not loud enough, and the screen was difficult to see in the daylight. Then we got home and turned it on and it said ""No Disk"". Tried many different disks. No luck.I returned it yesterday. Bought an audiovox unit (D1710) today.We first saw the Initial 1731 in Wal-Mart. The guy working there said it best. ""Yeah, they are great, when they work. Look at these two. They have done nothing but sit in the display case and they are broken"". We should have heeded his advice, but nope.Save your money. Or buy a different brand. These DO NOT last!!"
3,Good value 2 issues,"Overall I am pleased with the product...for the price. Display and picture good and including a car adaptor is another plus. I do have 2 issues. 1. Volume inadequate with and without headphones especially on a flight with engine noise turned all the way up I could hardly hear the movie, and my hearing is fine. I am investing another $100 in noise cancelling headphones 2. Battery life with screen is 2 hours...many movies are slightly above 2 hours and you miss the ending! I have tried all over to fond a second battery OEM Initial with no lock."
2,DONT BUY THIS JUNK,"Dont buy this piece of junk. I had it for about a year and had no problem, except that the color was peeling which was not a big deal. But one day, after such good treatment the dvd player screen jammed and couldnt open. I slowly pulled the screen up only to find out that the screen was loose and shaky. I then plugged it in to see that the screen was completly blank even though the rest of the DVD player was working. What kind of cheap junk is this- didnt they screw the screen to the player well. When i contacted amazon they asked me to contact the manufacturer which i am still waiting for their response.If you are thinking about buying this junk then think again, read all the reviews and youll know that this junk is not worth it. You can get far better ones for the same price."
4,good unit for the money,"Purchased the unit for my grandson. Unit came with all the attachments for home, auto,and battery for plane. The IDM-1731 played dvd, home burned dvd, cd, home burned cd. The picture is ok the speakers are better then the speakers on my more expensive Audiovox D1830 8"". I recommend the purchase of the IMD-1731 because unit appears to be good guality for the money."
2,wish it didnt stick,"I got the 7"" for christmas and 7 new dvd's. only 2 would play without STICKING. i played them in a regular dvd player and they were fine. one person called it FREEZING, because of heat build up. mine did it within one miniute of first use. So I dont think it is just heat. I am taking it back,,and havnt decided to give another unit a try yet. The more times I tried to get some dvd's to work, the more problems accured, started to not load,wouldnt shut off, wide screen dvd.s went to a smaller size,,it just went haywire. I am wondering ifitis one someone brought back,as it was trouble from the beginning. Great picture and sound when it did play without stopping"
5,This will also play DVD-R discs!,"I did not know this when I bought it, but it will also play ""DVD-R"" format discs- the ones you can burn yourself. I have a lot of these so this was a very nice surprise for me.Overall this is a very good little player- one hell of a lot better than anything that was available in its size and weight class, a year or two ago."
1,ZERO FOR TWO!,"I have had 2 of these, first one from Amazon and second from another store. When I turned on the first one and it said ""NO DISC"" ...tried several DVD's ( that work in the other players in my house) Finally got one to start. It worked for a couple of minutes before the picture and sound started to skip. Started over and it would stay stuck on ""LOADING"". Returned for credit.The second one seemed to work better the first day. This is day 2 and I am having the same problems I had with the first one.Two units- we haven't even watched an entire movie!I'll be returning another one and looking for a different brand!"
1,Do Not Buy this Product,"We have been able to watch a movie on this player once. Every other time we have attempted to use it, it skips or freezes. We have had nothing but problems with it."
1,Stay Away From Initial,"I hate to say it, but the people who have given this item good reviews haven't owned the player long enough. Initial's build quality is very poor- it is a fact that if you buy a product from Initial, it WILL need service. It is only a matter of time, and, unfortunately, not that much time. Now, you have your new DVD player that you were all excited to purchase, but it's worth jack because the screen hinge completely broke and it won't play movies. You now get the unenviable task of contacting Initial's customer support. It's a nightmare! I think their customer service is comprised of a bunch of 8 year olds in a sweat shop in India.Trust me on this one, go with a proven brand like Sony or Toshiba, and you won't regret your decision if anything ever goes wrong."
1,Watch your warranty date!,"This unit worked great - until exactly one year after I received it. No power, no picture, nada. Unfortunately, it was a Christmas gift, and my dad purchased it in November. Now we're one month outside of the warranty period and I own a $300 paperweight."
3,Good for what it does and what it costs!,"We have had this unit for about two weeks, and have just returned from a car trip to Boston, where our daughter used it in the car (with optional headphones), and we used it every night in our hotel room thru the TV set's RCA jacks.A fully charged battery lasted through one full DVD in the car, and we used it on AC in the hotel room. While the video on the internal screen isn't spectacular, it is usable, while the video thru the TV was perfectly acceptable. Contrary to other reviewers, you can set ""bookmarks"" to return to specific scenes, however, the menus are not very ""user friendly."" The remote is handy, however, it would have been nice to be able to shut off all power AND be able to control the volume of the TV.We have not yet tried using the external DC power cord in the car, but I'm sure that it works as specified.It will probably save us it's price in DVD rentals, or room charges, when we travel!"
1,Will not read Duel Disks,"I bought my model 1731, 7"" Inital portable DVD player a Walmart a week ago. I started watching aome of my faverite movies on a car trip and it kept frezzing up in the middle of the disk, I soon found out from a eletronice speicalist that it has trouble reading duel disks, well thats great all the new disks today are duel layered I only had two disk that it woud read all the way threw and that was becuase it was older DVD disk and was not duel disk. I soon replaced it with a 8"" 1810 Inital and it worked great. I say do not buy the 7"" becuse this model has problems."
2,BEWARE!,"I purchased this player 12/31/2003 and have used it no more than twice a month for maybe 45 minutes at a time on average since that time. Now it suddenly won't play any disks....it simply keeps ""loading"" for hours. It's beyond the warranty and the cost of repair exceeds the cost of the player. Go with a different brand!I'm giving it two stars intead of one only because it did play nicely while it lasted."
2,dissapointed,"I bought this unit because of the great features and a good price. It would be phenomenal if the screen didn't freeze and skip every few seconds. It's extremely frustrating. Mine is going back after only three days. Hopefully the manufacturer can get it together to fix this flaw. Otherwise it would be absolutely perfect. The picture is great, the sound, the fact that you can view pics or listen to music as well is a big bonus. I should have read reviews first."
2,Don't review this item for at least 30 days!,"I have seen plenty of reviews on this item, and I must say that I wish I would have seen them before I purchased it. All of the negative reviews have all happened to me too. The problem is, it takes longer than just a few times of using it for the problems to arrive, they start after the warranty is up. Every positive review this player gets is from people who have just purchased it. The most annoying thing is that the picture freezes up and you have to keep resetting the movie. This was frustrating to me, but even more to my kids. We purchased this player because it was the cheapest we could find. We have now decided that you should not buy a DVD player by that criteria. Spend a little extra money, and save yourself the trouble."
1,"Initial IDM-1731 Portable DVD Player with 7"" LCD","Don't buy this item! As you might expect it is a very low quality item and it has TERRIBLE support. My daughter used it less than 10 hours before the screen froze then it stopped working all together! She is not a brute and takes care of her things, yet this poorly made and non-supported item failed. I called customer support and the best they could offer is a $155.00 replacement. I can buy a new one at AMAZON for $170! It is still within the one year warranty but out of the 90 labor included.If you do get it as a gift, as she did, always ask the presenter for the receipt or you are out of luck.DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!"
1,Initially worked good,"I received this initial dvd player one year ago (2004) for christmas. It worked pretty good for a few months, but then I began noticing the poor sound quality and a low humming sound coming out of the speakers. Also, the coloring rubs off of the dvd player very easily. Now, sometimes when I put a dvd in it shows up 'no disc' and the laser has to be popped back into place. I wouldnt recommend purchasing this player, even if it means putting a little extra cash out for a better one you will be happier in the long run. I am considering buying a new dvd player."
2,Total Letdown,"I bought one of these units with the hopes of my daughter using it on car trips. I guess I was wrong there. The unit cannot take even the smallest bump without either the picture or the sound going off. Then the unit cannot find its place where it left off. The total DVD has to load again from the beginning. The unit also does not have that good of a picture. Overall I would not waste my money on this unit. I have since returned it for a different brand. I think this is a ""ypu get what you pay for"" situation."
4,Great Buy for All Ages,"I recently bought this product. The screen is very clear, the sound is great, and it comes with a small remote. The only bad part is that you have to charge the battery for 6 hours, and it only lasts for about 3 hours. Unless you listen to music then it last about 4 hours. I would recommend buying this product."
5,A great buy,"Our family has been using this unit for about a month and we love it. We've used it in the car and around the house. No problems so far with DVDs freezing, skipping, etc. Sure, the picture and sound don't stack up to Sony and Panasonic - but my young children can't tell the difference. For less than $200 bucks, you can't beat it."
4,Worth every penny.,"My family has been very happy with our Initial portable dvd player. I mean, come on, for a little more than $200 if it lasts for a year or two you've got your money's worth out of it. It beats renting one in the airport for long plane rides or car trips. We use ours for the kids on the plane rides overseas, in the car for long drives and it even comes in handy camping or around the house if you want to watch a movie and the ""family dvd player"" is already being used for some Disney flick. So....I'm happy with the $250 investment. It also travels well, we've banged it around a little and it works fine."
1,don't buy it,"Bought as a Christmas gift, worked twice. When you put in a DVD, it didn't go past loading then when you opened the player to take out the DVD it kept spinning..."
1,Piece of Crap,"Bought this on December 18, 2003, on Jauary 2, 2004, the picture went out on it. Waste of money."
1,Great for the time it worked,"This dvd player worked great but we used it so little and it died right at the end of the warranty period. We probably used it twenty times in all, and most of those times were hour-long trips."
2,Screen broke after 6 uses.,"I received the IDM-830 (not this exact model) as a gift and used it about 6 times. It worked very well until the plastic covering the hinge that moves the screen broke on one side. It was still operable (but kind of flimsy) until the plastic covering the second hinge broke. Now the screen doesn't get an image at all. I'm going to send it in for warranty (I've had it a little over 2 months) and I'll update whether they ""make it right"" or not."
3,Smaller than you expect,"Seven inches is smaller than you expect. The screen is only like three inches wide. And the package is a little larger than expected from the size of the screen.I know they probably give you the dimensions, but just wanted to let you know that I was surprised."
3,Problem,"Although the unit works great, the technical specifications listed are inaccurate. This unit DOES NOT have audio/video inputs. A change in production and engineering has deleted this KEY feature. When contact was made with manufacturer, customer service was even unaware of change. After speaking with engineering it was determined specifications were changed. There is no fix. If you intend on using a portable gaming system (gamecube) to entertain kids on a long trip in a car, this unit is NOT for you! I found out just hours before departing."
4,Very Good results for low price!,"We have had a 5 inch model for a few years and it has the skipping problem every once in a while. We decided we needed another unit due to family issues and wanted to keep in the Initial family. Prior to purchasing the the 7 inch, I contacted Initial customer support and mentioned all the issues that were reported here. We were informed that they had made software modifications that eliminated the skipping and freezing. We were advised to look for newer serial numbers. We have had no issues with our new DVD player. We have found that the motor noise is helped by using Earplugs. All in all you just can't beat the price."
4,My Two-Cents Worth............,"I've owned the Initial Portable DVD player with the 8"" screen now for almost a year, and I couldn't be happier with it. The picture quality is beautiful, and the sound (with headphones) is fabulous. The only one drawback is that the unit does heat up after awhile which can freeze up the picture, but that's only occured a couple of times. I discovered immediately that on plane trips, all one has to do to correct the heating up problem, is to aim the air jet above your head at it!!! Hope this info is useful to some. Happy New Year!"
3,Initial Portable DVD Player IDM-1731,"Sorry to say, my husband has not even unpacked this DVD player! He wasn't too happy that our daughter bought it. We both told him to hurry up & make up his mind whether we should return it, but he hasn't done that either...Sorry I can't do better than this.Genie Olson"
3,um how do i hook a gaming system to this thing?,i want to hook up my xbox gamecube or ps2 to this protable dvd player i jut got yesterday. can anyone show me ? a couple of people said you can but didnt say how. someone would be really nice to show me how.
3,Portable DVD,"Hello CHunling,I was also considering buying this product so let me know if you find some useful information"
4,Great for what it is...,I got this in May and have used it alot scince then. I find the picture to be good. However the speakers in it are poor. I would just get good external ones.
1,Piece of Junk,"Well, I hope other people have had better luck with this thing then I. I can't watch a whole movie on this thing without it getting ""stuck"" about every 10 minutes. I'm not talking about beat up DVDs, I mean fresh out of the box brand new DVDs. Not one of them (I've tried roughly 30) will play for more then 10 minutes with out it freezing up.I've decided to junk this thing and buy a better one."
2,Okay portable - terrible LCD,"the LCD is pixelated and poor color rendition ... whites washed out, most scenes strongly blue tinted, greens turn out blue, reds are ugly alsocomes with some cables, and large, rechargable battery, but no s-video output cable, and the output jack is not the standard s-video type"
3,"Lots of accesories, but one key flaw:","SOLUTION INCLUDED:It doesnt play dvds.. period. It lasted a week, then it stoped playing DVDs. Hence, I went to work. To fix the problem of non playing DVDs, I started with a heavy sheet of paper. I cut a 1in by 1in square out. Next, I placed a CD's ring in the center of the tiny slip of paper, then I used a pen to trace the edges over and over until the center popped out. The end product is essentially a circle within a 1in by 1in square. Next, I put the square on the spinning ring that holds the DVD in place. It is a snug fit. Push it down all the way. Next comes the DVD. Place it in the DVD player, and press firmly. HERE'S THE KEY PART: MAKE SURE THE CLIPS ON THE SPINING DISK ARE FULLY PUSHED OUT AND GRIPPING THE DVD. This assures that the dvd is as far away from the laser as possible, level, and secure! Voila, it works! I have tried burned DVDs as well as normal DVDs, they work well with this arrangment, althought they sometimes take time to load. Enjoy!"
4,Fair judgement,"Read all the reviews and decided to buy this. I indeed made a good choice. True, there is warmth after using it for 6 hrs. but this is not that hot; my kid watch it in a bus that was so bumpy,it never skipped. You have to use the earphone to hear it & that's ok. True the battery last 2 hrs. but you can use car adopter. Sound is ok. Screen is big enough to enjoy it & very clear color. Buy it."
2,Good Idea- Bad DVD player!!,"The first time I put a DVD in this player it said loading 'No Disc' I thought the player was new so I ignored it , but after three days of some disc playing and others not, I sent this disc player back. All total I had this player 8 days.Cons:You get 2 pair of headphones, cigarette-lighter adaptor, carry pouch and a credit card sized remote. Free shipping from Amazon, then UPS came back to my house to pick this crap back up to deliver it back to Amazon."
2,Big Disapointment,"When I first purchased this portable DVD player I was quite pleased with it. The picture was clear and the sound came thru nicely. However, after just 6 months of use, it just stopped working. It keeps telling me ""no disc"". It has only been used by my daughter while sitting in the car so it has not been dropped or abused in anyway.Now I know why it was on sale. I won't buy this brand again."
3,Falls short of first two albums..,"This album has some strange songs like ""I just shot John Lennon"" and that song that makes you feel like you're in a circus (forgot the name of it). I miss the old cranberries. Their latest album is even worse.. I don't know what's happening to them.. I wish they would come out with an album similar to ""everybody else is doing it so why can't we?"" Come back cranberries!!!"
3,Change is good.,"You have to give the Cranberries credit for being brave and branching out (as that was the main problem on their last two albums). The problem here, though, is the same as it was on the others: too much filler. Songs like ""Free To Decide"" and ""Hollywood"" are great, but others (""Forever Yellow Skies"", ""Joe"") really aren't worth much more than a few spins. Still, though, this album is far more adventureous than the others, and the songs are fairly good. The best of the three Cranberries albums (though it still can't hold a candle to Sinead O'Connor's ""I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got"" or The Sundays' ""Reading, Writing, And Arithmetic."")"
4,Not that much different from other albums,"I dig this album quite a bit. In fact I rate it just as highly as their first two, and perhaps higher than their first album; I don't own their second."
3,The Cranberries have Sinned and Triumphed at the same time,"The Cranberries, in this album, have committed the ultimate musical sin - they have blatantly duplicated a previous hit song. ""Hollywood"" is, with the exception of the lyrics, 100% identical to the earlier ""Zombie."" Plus, the ending from ""Daffodil Lament"" has been stolen for the beginning of ""Electric Blue.""That said, this CD also contains some of the greatest original material I've ever heard from the band. ""Salvation"", ""The Rebels"", ""I'm Still Remembering"", ""Joe"", ""When You're Gone"" and especially ""Free To Decide"" are _fantastic_.If it wasn't for the sin of ""Hollywood"", this CD would rate four, almost five stars..."
3,Not their best but not anywhere near bad,"To The Faithful Departed is, without a doubt, the weakest of the Cranberries' albums. However it's still a damn good cd.There are some really terrific songs on the album, including one of my all-time favorite Cranberries songs, The Rebels, as well as Hollywood, Salvation, When You're Gone, and Forever Yellow Skies.It's probably the only Cranberries album that has several songs I simply don't care for. Still, I love the cd and still listen to it."
2,To the Faithful Departed,"The Cranberries borrow punk riffs in an attempt to add an edge to their sound, however they do not do it well on most of the songs. The lyrics are more hokey than thought provoking, however the follow up albumn really made up for this mess."
4,Salvation!,I don't see what the problem is. Ok. This cd is no masterpiece. But it is really good. I give it 3.5 stars of 5 so I actually give it 4. It is different from the previous two albums but making different kind of music is a good thing. If the music itself is good. (sometimes it isn't). I love Dolores voice and I love most of the songs on this cd because it is really good. Although it seemed to be some problems it has some great tunes.Salvaton is great track and it was a huge hit (not in the USA).At least i remember it was given a lot of ariplay back in summer of '96. I hope this rewiev helped you.
5,Had to repurchase this album. It's great!,Was one of my favorites growing up! Had to buy it again and get nostalgic.
3,Good fruit is starting to mold,"Indeed, a third entry in the groups sweetly blossoming discography began the obvious faithful departure from genuine songwriting evolution, with limitations hinted at previously coming into complete (de)fruition. Even with the group repeating themselves melodically and structurally throughout, and some pretty immature lyrical dealings, somehow a sincerity in the chemistry still vastly shines through, no less in O'Riordan's clunkiest sentiments."
4,Still Faithful,"For their third album, the Cranberries dropped producer Stephen Street for some guy who produced Bon Jovi. Not a good move. The production on songs such as ""War Child"" and ""Bosnia"" are simply over the top. They should've been buried. Do we really need a song in this world called ""I Just Shot John Lennon""? I'm sure Dolores' heart was in the right place, but this is simply un-appealing! That being said, that's my only criticism of this album. ""Hollywood"" rocks even harder than ""Zombie"". ""Salvation"" and ""Forever Yellow Skies"", it's kick butt time! ""When You're Gone"", ""Electric Blue"" and ""Joe"" are sweet ballads. ""I'm Still Remembering"" is a call for affection. Ten great/good songs can make me forgive and forget the three bad ones. I liked this cd more and more over time, but there's definitely a ""rushed"" feel to some of it. As if the Cranberries just had to get a cd out quickly and slapped it together. Simply program out the three (bad)songs, then you'll remain faithful to the Crans!"
4,Very good,"A really good album, but personally I preferred their first two. But nonetheless, this is very good. They add more of a punk sound to some songs, but still manage to do some pretty ballads, like ""When you're gone"". Dolores' voice is still as beautiful as ever in its sometimes haunting quality. ""War Child"" was probably inspired by her guest appearence on Pavarotti's War Child concert the previous year, which you can hear on ""Pavarotti and friends for the Children of Bosnia"". Dolores does a wonderful duet with Pavarotti of ""Ave Maria"". It seems that some reviewers were disappointed with this effort, but I think that after a few listens it will grow on anyone. Give it a chance...it really is good."
2,cranberries with turkey,"And boy is this a turkey! There's nothing worse than rock stars trying to ""change the world"" with trite lyrics and vapid sermonizing. What is it with these Irish rock stars - if it ain't Bono, it's Sinead or Sir Bob - they all seem to have a need to make statements about social problems but the problem with Dolores here is that she sings about drug addiction, war, murder, fame, etc. as if no one has ever heard - or sang - about them before. It's all been said and done, Dolores, and if you must get preachy try doing it with a sense of humor - it's more effective. I wanted to slash my wrists after hearing this."
2,small model,unable to judge the size by photo-much smaller than expected. better to have something in photo that gives size comparison.
1,What?,"Sarah's Seduction (Men of August, Book 2)Ok, I love Lora Leigh's books but I just finished reading this one and I have to say...What? The story is about an abused girl brought to live with three abused brothers. Let me see...They are her addoptive uncles, everyone has been sexually abused and now they all want to be a family and have sex together. I fliped back several times to see if I missed something since you never really know how everyone is related or how they were abused or why they are together. I'm sorry to say I would skip this one."
4,Nearly 5 stars,"Despite the editing errors and the premise of an alpha male demanding his woman submit sexually to his brothers because of their abusive youth (did push my comfort zone somewhat) I would have given this story 5 stars and understood, or tried to understand, the need these 3 men had to connect through their women.If only Marly's Choice hadn't had a scene where Cade tried to set up a real orgy (with another woman & man and his brothers, himself & Marly). For me, that attempt blew the brothers ""need to connect"" through sex with their siblings' women all to hell and back. It really turned me off and made the whole premise of the ""need to connect"" ring as phony as a three-dollar bill. Fortunately the remaining books in this series avoid any ""outside the family"" sexual attempts.Aside from that one scene the rest of the book was good. The characterizations were fascinating, the sex was hot, the story interesting. Love Lora Leigh's writing and can't wait for more books."
4,"Its Erotica, not Romance!","Lora Leigh is a well known writer of women's erotica, which is just a nice way of saying female porn. So if you plan on reading this book for romance or a detailed storyline -- then don't. But if you are looking for plenty of well-written, hot sex -- than buy the series!Unlike many other 'erotica' writers, Lora Leigh's writing is actually interesting and the sex scenes are some of the best I've ever read.As you go through the other reviews and read how some people considered the storyline 'lacking' and the reason behind the threesomes stupid, keep in mind this is not a romance -- its erotica!!!! You should be reading it for the sex and not the validity of the storyline. Who cares why they need threesomes!! I'm just glad they do!!"
4,Good easy read,"Liked the book on my Kindle, will to find the other two stories. Will add them to my library to keep and reread them a lot. Thanks"
4,Not for the faint hearted,"This is not for people that is not used to this kind of writing.Maya Banks is another author that likes to write about this topic.That is where I first read about the possibility of 3 brothers and 1 woman.If it is going to disgust you rather don't read it. But for those who wants to read about fantasy sex and not take this too seriously this is for you.Just go with it, if you dare;)"
2,just ok,"Personally this book didn't do it for me. There are some really hot sex scenes but that's about it. It doesn't normally take me two and half weeks to read a book but thats how long it took me. I finally finished when the cable went out in my hotel room due to a storm. There are so many things left unsaid that its ridiculous. They all have secrets, then there was this huge build up to a stalker for it to end in a paragraph. I saw great reviews for books two and three but I can't bring myself to purchase them because I really didn't like this one."
3,"If you can look past the unrealistic and ick factors, this book is hot!","This book is decidedly not for everyone. There's the menage aspect, yes, but also the fact that these are brothers basically forcing a woman who loves them to be shared among them. I get that they are damaged from childhood abuse, but I don't see how that translates into incest in this manner. With that all said, if you can sort of forget that for a moment and focus on the relationships, not the cause of them, this book is hot. Lora Leigh's characters sizzle with chemistry from page one. Definitely more than a few moments to absolutely make you squirm. I'm definitely reading book 2 as I'm told she explains a little more of what caused them to be this way."
3,Not my favorite book,"I thought the book was good until towards the end when the brothers ""helped"" out with the sex....it didn't fit with the rest of the story at all. Kind of just thrown in there but not real believable."
3,Different...,"I love Lora Leigh's books and have read her Breed series which is pretty racy but the whole premise of this book was a little strange. I agree with the other readers when they say she wasn't really given a ""choice"" at all. I disagree with the ""disturbing"" reviews as it wasnt really disturbing but just weird. It was free and I glad for that otherwise I would have been mad that I spent the money."
3,Marly's Choice (Men of August Series),This book was okay but needs more thought put into it. The story line at the begging was good but come on Three brother's having to share their woman to feel love for each other because they can't show their love for each other because the things they experienced when they were children. I love Lora Leigh's books but this whole series could do for an all out overhall on the story line.
1,stay away,im one of lora's biggest fans but this series i didnt even finish. im all into alpha males ect but this was over the top and degrading. hello august men ever heard of therapy? this book was a waste of my time. the way they treat sarah in the second book made my stomach turn. no woman in her right mind would let a man come in her house to use her shower after screwing his brothers girlfriend when hes telling her he loves her and cant be without her!! ans he acts like its normal to sleep with her the same day!! no way this book is a no go sorry lora
2,Meh,"I have read many books by this author, she is very talented. However, I had a hard time getting into the characters in this book. It was tough keeping up with Cade's constant mood swings- I want you, but I'm conflicted, but I want you, that I can understand. But, he was cruel, mean, not at all the kind of guy we want the girl to end up with The weak, boring, Marly put up with being treated like a piece of trash. While some scenes were hot, most left me feeling like I was creeped out by these damaged men. I'm not sure I want to buy the rest of the series."
4,"Great, but better live.","I saw Rosie Ledet last week at Tipitina's, in New Orleans, and she was just fantastic! This CD is great, her music is very strong, but don't miss a chance of seeing her live. It's pure energy, a mix of African-American, French, and Lousianian cultures, with the right spice. Great lyrics. And too bad the pictures on the CD don't do justice to her."
5,"Didn't think I'd like it, but I LOVE it","I thought this was going to be too much of a teen movie, but I really, really liked it. It's a good vampire movie I think. I like that it didn't have a lot of cursing, no sex, etc. I will for sure purchase this one and now I'll have to start reading the books!"
4,Good blu ray quality disk has has a few extra features,"I have this movie on standard DVD I liked the film so I figured I may as well get it on a higher quality disk such as blu ray, and of course it looks good though not as good as some other blu ray disk I own but nice I got a good deal on it here at Amazon so why not rightThis version of the blu-ray DVD has audio commentary deleted scenes, and two music videos one by Paramore my personal favorite decode, and I also enjoy the Linkin Park video. so over all it's a good blu ray disk worth buying, if you love the Twilight films you gotta start with the first of the trilogy, it's extra fun to watch in blu ray format. thanks for reading."
2,read book AFTER watching movie . . .,"the movie kinda sux actually. except for a FEW main points, its very different from the book. i would recommend watching the movie BEFORE you read the book for the 1st time, cause once you compare the two, you'll never want to watch the movie again except to see Pattinson's heavenly face.oh and PS. it contains a SCHMUCK of an audio commentary. totally un-professional, un-informative, and stupid."
4,Twilight,"I think Twilight is a pretty good movie of the genre. I thought the special effects were well done, and the acting was good. The flow of the movie was decent and the suspense was heart pounding.! Kristen Stewart is a knockout!"
5,Twilight (two-disc special edition),I love it so much..cudnt wait for the next Full Moon dvd to come out
1,TWILIGHT,NO THRILLS NO SPILLS .STRANGE NAME (TWILIGHT) FOR A VAMPIRE MOVIE AND VERY STRANGE MOVIE .NO ACTION SLOW PACE BORING NOT MUCH GOING ON .THIS MOVIE IS LIKE BEEN PRODUCED BY AMATUR DIRECTOR .IT HAS NO FEEL FOR A VAMPIRE MOVIE .WHEN I WATCHED THIS MOVIE IT FEELS LIKE WATCHING TV SERIES BY UNKNOWN ACTORS WHO STARTED TO ACT A WEEK AGO.EVEN BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE WAS MUCH BETTER NOT TO MENTION INTERVIEW WITH A VAMIPRE BRAM DRACULA AND OTHERS VAMPIRE MOVIES .BOTTOM LINE BY FAR WORST VAMPIRE MOVIE I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME .IT HAD POTENTIAL PLAYED BY KNOWN ACTORS WHO PLAYED WELL IN OTHER MOVIES BUT ALOT IS MISSING WHEN WATCHING THIS MOVIE
4,Happy with Purchase,"After watching this movie, I wanted to buy the DVD. Price was great and shipping was on-time."
5,twilight DVD,Excellent first installment in the Twilight franchise. Includes a fun 2nd disk with extras. Get it and get ready for New Moon!
3,twilight movie,"As usual, the book is way better than the movie. But if you can look at it for what it is, then it's not so bad. They tried to cover the main points but left out the intense ""love"" the characters feel for each other. I almost feel that the director went out of the way to reorganize the events instead of going by the book."
5,Amazing,"My grand daughters told me to read the books and I thought, nah, these are for kids. So I watched the movie ""Twilight"" and was mesmerized, absolutely amazing. I immediately read all four books in four days. Stephenie Meyers is a truly great talent of our time and the movie was cast perfectly. I think i watched the movie six times. I enjoyed it more every time. Kudos to Stephenie Meyers and her writing, the movies and the wonderful stars of ""Twilight""."
4,"Not The Best Movie, But I Still Liked It","The first time I saw this, I didn't think it was the best movie. Now I think I should buy it on DVD. I want to see New Moon.My mom didn't like it much.It's OK, but my favorite part was the fight scene.I didn't rate it 5 stars because at the beginning throughout the middle it is sort of boring."
3,:( :( :(,"my dvd has no dvd case im so sad about that, if i had know that i wouldn't of bought the dvd. but the dvd is good i suppose"
1,Which is Worse,"being drained by a blood-sucking vampire or watching Catherine Hardwick's amateurish direction? The movie is difficult to watch, as one is always aware of the presence of the camera. Alfred Hitchcock and John Woo draw you into wonderfully framed and directed scenes. This only appears sloppy, misguided and gives me a headache from the opening scene. I am on my third attempt to get through this monstrosity. But I have the same problem with the original Star Wars movies, so maybe it's just me. Arghh! Gonna need to get me some Rogaine after pulling out all my hair watching this, though."
2,"Original story, too much of a love theme.","I love how this is an original vampire movie rather than blood, guts and gore. Don't get me wrong, I am a sucker for a good vampire movie (Queen of the Damned is among my favorite movies), but this one has too much of a lovey dovey love theme. And it makes Edward look bad when he sparkles, he looks like he is gay to a point. But despite that, I love how the storyline is about people and not trying to kill everyone. Two stars is for the originality, but it's too mushy and hardly related to vampires."
1,worst movie ever,"do not waste your money on this horrible movie. buy buffy the vampire or the vampire diaries instead. twilight consits of bad acting,emotionless characters, a mary sue,wanabe vampires that sparkle in the sun and a werewolf that doesn't know what a shirt is. just like call of duty, i don't know how this series got so popular. edward cullen needs to get shot into oblivion by alucard. meyer can't write to save her life. go watch hellsing or vampire knight instead of this crap."
4,"I love this movie, but...","My wife loves this movie, but the only thing that could've made this better was if it was in full screen.I recommend buying this movie to anyone that does not have a preference on whether or not it is wide screen or full screen, because it is in fact, wide screen.You need the Amazon unbox video thing to download it but you can watch it on Windows Media Player after you have downloaded it."
4,Not bad,"I just got my Ultimate Blu-ray edition in the mail and it isn't entirely what I was expecting. The blu-ray disc, the photos, and the soundtrack are awesome, however, the jewelry box is made out of cardboard and the bookmark is nothing special. The bookmark just says Twilight on it. I have seen better bookmarks on other websites sold separately. The bracelet is decent. The watch looks like a kids watch that you can purchase out of a gumball machine. I am mostly just happy to have the dvd, but for $80, I was expecting the quality of the other items to be much, much better than they were. Overall, it probably would have been better to buy the blu-ray disc separately and then shop around at other websites, like Etsy.com, for the other items made from better material."
3,What is all the hype?,"It took me this long to finally sit down and slog through this movie. I didn't expect too much from it which was probably a good thing. After listening to girls at work fawning over this series of movies I finally rented this movie to give it a chance.The movie started out slow and never picked up any speed and did not hold my attention throughout ANY of it. In fact I couldn't wait for it to end...I don't consider the brooding of the main characters acting and there was no chemistry with Edward and Bella. I know this is a teenage drive movie but I don't understand why they would be so into this boring, drug out movie. The pale makeup on the ""vampires"" was actually funny. The amazingly white bleached teeth of the other long haired vampire (I think his name is Jacob??) was laughable as was his long hair.I think I can skip the sequels..."
1,Bad,"I enjoyed the books, but this is one of the worse acted, worse directed movies I have seen in a long time."
4,I'm addicted,"I thought this series would be very geared to teens but I am in my 30's and I love them. It really is a Love story and Bella and Edward are great together, has some suspense to it with the vampire stuff. But that is what movies should be fantasy and fact and fiction all combined. I'm hooked."
4,Good movie,Watch it and then you see what all the hoopla is about. Good movie if your into vampires and all that jazz.
5,Love it!,"I kept borrowing the movie from the library, finally saw it on sale for $5.00 (within my entertainment budget) and bought it. Now I can have marathons whenever I want!!"
5,Vampires,My daughter just had to collect all the Twilight movies cause she wanted to have some friends over to watch them.
2,Mostly for girls...,"I mean it. I liked the book, that was more endurable for me. But this movie? I felt like it was made JUST for one gender.the story was stupid, and after reading the Dresden Files, how this movie portrays vampires is simply bad. The visuals are weak. The final fight is not executed and choreographed well. But I didn't fall asleep. Plus, it was so stupid i laughed. So I'd give it a 3.5/10. Poor and atrocious. But guys, if you want to laugh at the performances(especially Pattinson's) go ahead."
2,Cheesy...,"Although the movie maintains the integrity of the book pretty well, it comes across as a cheap imitation. Bella stutters and blinks throughout the whole movie, which was VERY annoying. Some of the scenes were so contrived and cheesy, that one had to laugh. The movie has enjoyed so much popularity, I think, in part because the actors are very attractive, and it is an anguished love story, with Edward playing the part of the perfect gentleman, every woman's fantasy. I loved the Twilight saga in book form, but I have to admit that the movie seemed very low budget. I hope, considering Twilight's success, that with a new director and larger budget, New Moon will be a production of higher quality and standards. Still, Twilight isn't bad if your looking to kill a few hours with silly entertainment in the movie theater."
1,Unwatchable,"""Twilight"" is a romantic vampire movie with all the emotional depth of an after school TV special. The story can be summed up in one sentence: Teenage Bella, played by buck toothed Kristen Stewart, moves from Arizona to Washington and falls in love with a vampire named Edward played by Robert Pattinson.And just like an after school special ""Twilight"" contains bad dialogue, bad acting, and no suspense whatsoever. Also, the voice overs by Stewart throughout the film wear thin quickly, and the camera work is amateurish at best.The lamest thing about this movie is Edward the vampire. Pattinson's acting in this movie is just awful and the make-up to make him look pale is cheesy. In some scenes in which the character is wearing a T-shirt you can see that his face is pale but his neck and shoulders are not, as if the actor applied the make-up himself.Yes I know that this movie was made with 13-year-old girls in mind, but they deserve better than this."
1,Since when can a vampire be out during daytime?,"I'm fairly certain that the one universal truth for all vampire nostalgia and vampire movies, is that they only come out at night. A baseball game with vampires in the middle of the day? Don't give me the overcast lack of sunlight excuse, I have solar panels and they still pickup UV light with full cloud cover. Ridiculous that everyone falls head over heels for this vampire flick CW style. Uhhhh....ever hear of True Blood on HBO? It is far superior, obviously the rest of the world is shielded from HBO's quality programming, so pick up the Sookie Stackhouse books then."
1,What a Disgrace! READ THE BOOK INSTEAD.,"Please read PHOENIX CHILD's review of this movie. It captures everything that needs to be said about this movie. I am in full agreement with that review. This movie was horrible, accept for the very beginning. If you only saw the Movie, do yourself a favor and FORGET IT. You are truly missing out if you haven't read the book. So search Amazon right now and BUY THE BOOK!"
2,"Make any sense, Amazon?","I agree with the previous reviewers...I am thinking about canceling my order so I can get the Blu Ray sooner. It doesn't make sense that I have to wait when I can get it sooner. Sure, it has the charm bracelet, watch, jewelry box, etc, but it is going to be that great of quality? I don't agree with having to wait til May when everone else comes out in March...What are you thinking Amazon (I mean, Owners of Amazon)?"
5,Amazing,This Movie is amazing. I cant wait for the next one. I have to say my favorite part of the movie is the Ballet Studio fight were Edward saves bella from james!!!!
1,GREAT MOVIE....,"...If you're a barely post-pubescent teenage girl with no taste in film.The books are even worse.Want a good vampire movie with teenagers in it? Watch THE LOST BOYS (the first one, not the sequel)Want a good book featuring supernatural elements? Read DUMA KEY by Stephen King.This is trash."
1,SINCE WHEN DO VAMPIRES SPARKLE!,"This movie is not even close to a good vampire film.The acting was terrible, the visual effects were not at all impressive andI could not make a connection with any of the characters.If your looking for a REAL Vampire film in this era that will send a chill down your spine, you might want to try""Let the Right one in"". Even though it is in swedish-eng subbed, it is what a vampire film really is."
1,Twilight; Not a Good Movie,"Its terrible. The only reasons that it is getting good reviews is because every Twilight fan is writing ""ITS AMAZING!""If you like Twilight, then get this movie. I heard its actually a good adaptation if you read the book series and liked it. If you just randomly want to check it out; I suggest finding another movie. If you're curious; I suggest finding another movie. If you're really, really, really curious then just rent or pirate it.Its full of cliches, you can see the wires the actors where hanging on, and my friend and I would laugh at all the dialogue in it. We'd also laugh at some of the special effects. Seeing a sparkling vampire and hearing the line ""This is the skin of a killer?"" Is actual one of the funniest things I've seen.Pretty much wins best unintentional comedy of the year. That's pretty much what you don't want for a movie.The only thing I can say is that the coloration of the film was pretty. Other than that, its not worth the money."
1,Are you glittering.... or just extremely sweaty?,"So, this movie was a piece of glittering trash. To be honest, Edward is the Hannah Montana for teenage girls. Just another stupid obsession. The ""glittering"" seemed to be more like sweating, and they cut out way too much from the book. This movie had potential, but sadly it was EPIC FAIL!!!!!"
1,FAIL,"1. Since I was already logged into my amazon account, it went straight to my credit card without letting me even enter the code, so I have no idea if it works or not.2. The unbox player won't download on my computer, even with firewalls and security turned off. I must have tried 10 times and left it overnight to see if it would suddenly appear - nothing.3. Watching it online is jerky and annoying.I've contacted customer service about it all, but I'll never pre-order a DVD or use their online video rentals ever again."
2,"Great concept, execution fail","I wasn't one of those who freaked out because Twilight wasn't arriving in my mailbox on the 21st. I knew I'd survive a few days without it. So when I got the email from Amazon saying I could rent it for free, I thought it was cool and I decided to watch it Sunday morning. My promo code worked, I started the movie, and after 2 hours I'm about 1 hour in, thanks to the video ""connecting"". I know that many people have had this problem, and I'm sure part of it is that so many people are trying to watch the movie in the same time frame, and while I'm not one to complain about free things (and am more than happy to sit through the occasional buffering), it's starting to get ridiculous. I agree with previous posts- thanks for the free movie, but next time make sure the promos work. I'll continue to order from Amazon, but I'm probably not going to do Video On Demand from them again."
2,Still Holding Out Hope,"First Off I did Not Like this movie maybe if I had watched it before reading the book i might have but even then the whole movie just seemed rushed like they were trying to just get it all over with if anything they should have spent a little time with the relationship development. How you really have no look at how intence their feelings are for each other. Which is a bad start for the movies they plan on making which stem from their feelings for each other. Its just a bad start, but I'm still holding out hope that the new director might save it because if New Moon doesn't do it I'm done"
2,You have to disable the firewall on your anti-virus!,I had the problem of the download waiting in queue and doing nothing. I read through the reviews frustrated as everyone else and found someone actually had the suggestion of disabling their firewall. I have Norton and once I disabled the firewall the download began right away. I hope this helps frustrated viewers. I cannot comment on the quality of the download as it currently states I have 2+ hours to download. It would be helpful if Amazon included a troubleshooting area or warned people about the firewall obstacle.
2,Meh.....,"Eh.I ordered and read the Twilight saga on my Kindle and immediately re-read them after finishing. I freaking LOVE the books, and while I know that movie adaptations often leave something to be desired, I held out hope that Twilight could be on the same level as Harry Potter or LOTR.Nope.""Bella"" is flat and sullen, ""Edward"" acts like a moody 17 year old despite his supposed years, ""Rosalie"" looks about 30, and all of Bella's friends are very one dimensional. I understand having to modify the plot to make it fit into the timeframe of a movie, but the complexity and progression of Bella and Edward's relationship doesn't come through at all in the film.I still bought it. I love the books enough to get a little thrill out of seeing the story on screen. But I'd watch it first if you're a fan of the books."
2,Twilight,"When I received the email about the free download, I was satisfied since my DVD is only coming on Monday(which I thought I was to going to receive today)... Now as so many others are experiencing the download time is ridiculous...I didn't have a problem with my code but waiting for this to download is not fun! I want to see the damn movie, I will hopefully in 3 hrs 10 minutes and 54 seconds :(!!"
4,Movie Great! Amazon Instant Video Not So Great!,"Since I have some extra days off with the Thanksgiving holiday, I figured I would start watching the Twilight series to see what all the fuss is about. I must say this first one is very good! I like how it's more contemporary and up to date. I haven't watched a vampire movie since the 80s or 90s! There are a lot of things in this movie that I didn't know about when it comes to vampires. The chemistry between Bella and Edward whew! There was just enough action, romance and intensity. Now, I wouldn't recommend watching it on Amazon Instant Video as I did. The video kept freezing and buffering. So annoying! I checked my screen saver which was off. My connection kept going from high to low. I don't think it has to do with my internet connection or my PC either because I watched other videos with no problems. In any case, I'm on to the next one. Only I'm gonna just watch it on Demand or Redbox."
4,good movie to watch!,i didn't expect i would like it but i actually did ... i will recommend it to anyone who likes vampire & romance movies
3,Not Bad,"lived up to my expectations, sappy love story. Generally not my genre, but works for those who like this stuff"
3,Yuck!!,"I thought the story line was sweet. I am just no fan of vampire & werewolf movies. Dispite the love story plot, they still show the blood around the mouths in attacks. They have the black eyes during anger or feeding frenzies which are rather satanic looking. I can see why this movie is sweeping the nation but not for me. I was encouraged to watch because it was not the stereotype vampire movie but it still gave for a restless night."
1,Sucks,"This movie sucks. Ti makes you long for the good old days of mst3k where Joe and the bots could watch this. It was very boring, I watched it for 20 minutes then started checking my watch every two or three. Edward was creepy and abusive, I don't understand what was romantic about this movie at all."
2,A good story in the wrong hands,"I truly believe this movie could have been something really unique, genuinely creepy, and haunting. That is, under the right direction. When I think of how they SHOULD have made Twilight, I think of something along the same lines as Interview With The Vampire - sprawling, creative, and somewhat epic. Instead, some Catherine Hardwicke was given free reign of this movie, even though she's only ever produced mediocre-at-best films in the past. After watching Twilight, I can see her flare for cheesy melodrama is strong, and her cinematic flare is poor. Too bad."
3,Acting is bad...,"I love a good love story and really enjoyed the deep love Edward has for Bella but man...the acting is so bad. I thought everyone in the movie does a decent job. Really enjoyed Rob's character but Kristen is just so bad. The way she deliver her lines is just horrible. Her acting is really bad and making it really difficult to stay with the story. I wish they cast someone else other than Kristen Stewart. Since she is the main character, it makes me cringe everytime she opens her mouth and deliver a line."
1,Teeny Bop Pop Vomit,"Unfortunately, as we all know, this was amazingly popular with the ladies. It a essentially a massive sexual fantasy. To hook up with this amazingly perfect and powerful undead being is every girls dream? Seems pretty twisted to me."
3,"I admit it, I only watch the scenes with Edward in them!","I watched the movie the first time all the way thru. After that, I only did scene selection with the Edward scenes in them. I was interested before the dvd came out in the storyline, now I can be thoroughly honest with myself that I was only interested in Edward's character, and the accompanying music during the scenes with him in it. I recently ordered the book set and the movie music score cd. I really think i'd rather read the books to get more of a feeling of the whole storyline. I'll save my dvd and scene selection habits for bad weather days when it's lousy outside and I can have something nice to look at in the form ofEdward. Proud to say I'm female and 40. Hey, he is over 21 lol so it's ok....."
4,Twilight Review,"Since the books are so compelling, I think I keep watching the movie looking for the characters from the book. I noticed that the ""out takes"" were only a few minutes long and that they would have made the movie more like the book, especially the one called ""You don't know how it's tortured me."" Why would they take that out? Also the one where Charlie talks about the Cullens. That makes Charlie more a part of the story.The actors seem to be too nervous. The impression I get of Edward in the book is that he is extreemly confidant.I like the scenery and the actors chosen for the parts. I look forward to the next movie."
4,Twilight Movie,"My daughter enjoyed viewing the movie. These books are popular with teenagers and the price was good too.It's going to win the Academy Award, but it's better than many of the dopey movies released these days."
2,Twilight,Twilight (Two-Disc Special Edition)This movie did not meet my expectations after reading the books...too much was changed from the book version which made me not care for the movie...the books are great and fantastic I could read the books over and over again. The movie is okay but could have also been great if it would have followed the book a little bit better. I hope the next movie follows the book a little bit better.
3,Good movie with weed-smoking actresses and totally hot vampires,"Now I'm like most fan girls. I had a major Edward spaz attack when I saw Edward enter the lunch room for the first time. I give Edward Cullen the hotness award. Robert Pattinson definitly fit the IMAGE of Edward, his acting was ok. He definitly is drool worthy. Bella on the other hand.well this is no rumor but the girl who played bella got nervous before they started shooting the film and started smoking weed thats why she only has one facial expression on her face throughtout the whole movie.Overall the movie was ok, they should have picked a non-weed addicteed actress and got better special effects."
2,Whats up with the $32.99 retail price?,"Most first run of top dvd releases are 29.99 - this one is more, and sets a bad precedent. Stick with the paperback book at 10.99 - rent the movie."
3,"movie ok, book much much better","I have read the series, which I really enjoyed, and was excited to see the movie. After just watching it I have to say I was disappointed. I know that things had to be ""condensed"" to fit the movie time frame, but had you not read the book I think you would've been kind of confused. Also I felt that the acting was really poor. I'm glad I watched it, but I definitely won't be buying it on DVD."
3,Good Movie Horrible Amazon Unbox Video experience,"First of all, I did enjoy the movie and I would have given just the movie at least 4 stars. The video download exprience on the Roku was horrible. It stopped and started, taking upwards of 15 minutes each time it stopped to re-start. I checked my network connection on the Roku and it was excellent. I use the Roku for Netflix all the time and rarely have a problem. It would have been much cheaper and more satisfying to actually buy the dvd. I doubt very seriously if I will bother with the Amazon Unbox Video experience again."
2,"An insult to the book,but a must have for twillight saga fans.","I am a huge fan of Twilight Saga.I think you should read the books before watching the film as the film gets no where near the book. It is nice as you fill in the gaps and your visualisation gets better after watching the movie,However I would have definately not watch it again if I hadn't read the books.Like I said ""an insult to the book,but a must have for twillight saga fans"" so it had its place in my dvd collection shelf."
2,Just OK - Try Again!,"Having read the book, I found the movie quite superficial and therefore, disappointing. I was left feeling as if I only got half of the story. Sadly, I usually do find that most books are better than their movie counterparts. Perhaps they will do better producing the sequels in the series. Do yourself a favor and read the book , skip the movie!"
1,"Cardboard Movie: Disappointing, Pathetic.","A sad sad attempt at low-budget box office success gone horribly wrong. Everything campy and fun from the ""good"" ones is lost to the dull story choices, uninspired acting, and confusing unspoken communications between Edward and Bella.If I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have had a clue! I have read the book, however, and I highly recommend you do the same. Run FAR FAR away from this movie and read the book. You'll have time to savor it, engaging and enticing you to read more-- while unfortunately, this movie is bound to repel you from the entire series."
1,really bad,"just read phoenix childs review for my opinion. that's how i feel in a nutshell... they really messed up a potentially great vampire story... i think i'm mostly bitter because i was tricked into seeing this movie because the i liked the book so much. and this isn't a case of ""fiction books are hard to recreate""... it's a case of this was a really bad movie... it was almost like they did the bare minimum - or less than that - because they knew the young girls would pay no matter how bad... and those same girls are the same who are actually saying this movie was good. o well... write off those 2 hours of my life and move on..."
3,They'll get it right next time,"I've watched this twice now, and I think I can narrow it down to a really, really horrible script. This movie shouldn't have me laughing (it got 3 stars from me for pure entertainment, just not the entertainment they were hoping for), but it does. Charlie looks at a footprint and says ""human"" and I'm giggling and shaking my head. I was hoping Robert Pattinson wasn't just pretty, but in this movie he's...dull. He needs something, anything, to do (he's...um....attractive enough for me to want to give him another chance, and he seems like a bright guy). Kristin Stewart have doesn't seem to be able to change facial expression. She just opens her mouth a little and stares. So I guess direction may be a problem here as well.I'm not a hater or a huge fan, but I did really want to like this movie. For New Moon, they'll have a bigger budget, different director, and please, please, please a script doctor. I had high hopes for this movie, and was disappointed but entertained."
3,It is like this...,"It is like this... if you haven't read the books, you might like the movie. If you are a Twilight fan, you'll hate it. Having read the books first will only make you wish you hadn't waited so anxiously for the movie to come on DVD. Scenery : great; Casting: great (looks at least); directing: fine; Script: okay... acting: TERRIBLE.Sad to say but even though K. Stewart fits (in my taste) the description of Bella to the T, her acting is so painful to watch, you'll be hoping for the movie to end faster. R. Patterson is not much better. The rest of the cast is ok, but then again, they don't have that many lines. For me it was a dissapointment. Most painful part: when she is in the hospital and he is trying to say good bye... oh.my.gosh!... pitiful, pitiful, pitiful...I truly hope that K.Steward will get in some more acting classes between movies.Final word, I guess if you are a no-matter-what-Twilight fan, the movie is ok... but that's as good as it gets, just OK."
2,Wow...not what I was expecting,"I am a huge Twilight fan. I absolutely LOVED the whole book series. In fact, I have to admit, I became a little obsessed with it all. I got the movie and watched it expecting the best...and I thought it varied too much from the book. My hubby couldn't wait for it to be over then couldn't understand what I thought was so good about the book. Something else I figured out while watching this...I can't stand Kristen Stewart. I simply don't like her in this. I really wished this movie was half as good as the book."
2,Went No Where...,"I was not a huge fan of the movie, I guess if I were a 15 year old girl I would appreciate it a little more. I give it 2 stars for the mild action it had through out.The movie really just did not go anywhere, the acting was no so great on all levels, the makeup artist needs to be fired and the special effects were like a 1962 karate flick.Overall boring, loss of interest several times through out."
1,Good enough...for burning,"This makes the book look a thousand times worse. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life, and I usually cut some slack during reviews. But this is horrible. Awful. The director and the screenwriter must have been drunk, on drugs, haven't slept for weeks, or are in the mental health institute. What's the big deal about the Twilight series? Why did so many people get hooked? This answer will not be solved by a competent, non-brainwashed Twilight fan. Nope. The movies are much worse than the books and that's saying something! The plot and scenes were all either screwed up. The director added new scenes, which were not great. The sparkle effect was terrible. I bet there are loads of parodies out there making fun of this movie. Even my friends who like Twilight think this movie is a total disaster."
1,No vampires,This is far from a vampire movie. The author has even said she knows nothing about vampires.
2,very bad acting,"I have enjoyed the Twilight saga books for what they are (I'm not expecting them to be War and Peace, etc, but entertainment), but this movie is abysmal. The editing is choppy and the acting by the leads is lacking, especially Stewart. Her main expression is a blank stare and seems depressed and rude (was she on Xanax throughout the filming?). Bella was not depressed in this book. I think the character maybe smiled once during the whole thing. Put this on your Netflix if you're curious, but don't waste your money buying it. On the positive side, the soundtrack and score are wonderful. Also, some of the supporting cast is delightful such as Billy Burke, Kendrick, Welch, Greene, and Lutz."
4,"Good Movie, Better Book","The movie was good, but the book was much better. They had to cut so much out of the book to turn it into a movie. My husband went to the movies with me without seeing the movie and said it was a good movie but it did not have the same impact on him as it did me because he did not know the background. I found that there was a lot of information left out of the movie, but it is understandable. I would have rated the movie at a 5 star level if I had not read the book first."
4,love story,I guess since Im such a crazy fanatic I was a little disapointed with this movie. Overall I gave it a 4 rather than 5. I wasnt crazy about the director. I've heard if I were to watch it a second time it is way better. my expectiations are just too high. I dont really like how cold and clammy Caristle was made out to be. I could go on with little things but overall it was a good movie. Im hoping for the next film and new director it will be even better.
3,"Availability ""shenanigans""","I originally pre-ordered the Ultimate Amazon BluRay edition for $79 then, upon further research, I discovered that the ""Regular"" Special Edition BluRay package will be released on March 21 but only at Target and Bestbuy. If you want the BluRay version of the movie from Amazon, you have to wait until May 5 and pay a lot more because it has additional items such as the movie soundtrack CD (already own), charm bracelet, jewelry box etc. The problem is, there is NO WAY by daughter will wait 6-7 weeks from the day it is available at Target and BestBuy in BluRay to get it from Amazon. I don't blame Amazon, I blame Summit for messing with teenage girls' emotions in an attempt to maximize profit. I think I have this correct, but it's pretty complicated as to how they are releasing this movie. Unfortunately, I had to cancel the Amazon order because I know my daughter will be buying it on March 21'st from BB or Target."
2,Ordered for my daughter,"I don't like it, but I ordered it for my daughter who liked it. So we averaged at around 2 stars. There you have it. I like my vampires with more grit and more blood."
1,LOVE the book... DISAPPOINTED with movie,I absolutely love the twilight book and could not put it down. When I saw the movie I was extremely disappointed. The acting is horrible and it just seemed that they had a low budget for the film. If you did not read the book I do not know how you could even watch this movie.
3,The Mad Hatter Review,"This first installment of the Twilight series, as a beginning was pretty good. It seems that it was made with the assumption that the audience will have read the book series first. Having read the books, I liked it because I already knew the characters. I didn't agree with the movie editing which should have included a little more information about the characters. The vampire makeup was too overdone for them to be able to pass for being alive. Don't expect Academy Award acting, but the chemistry and the plot keep you engaged."
4,Twilight - Two-Disc Special Edition,"The movie was great in being able to see the characters come to life (so to speak!) It stayed true to the book. Of course, the book was better and more detailed, as is always the case. But the movie adaptation was still great - I've watched it three times already and I'm glad it's part of my DVD library.What I was a bit disappointed in, though, was that it is in the letterbox format. It takes away from the movie a bit, I think.Being able to have Edward Cullen in my living room at the flick of a switch is a definite perk! Can't wait to get the rest of the saga to view."
3,Book is much better,"I saw the movie before I read the books, though I always intended to read them (something I rarely do, as the book is always better). Initially, I really liked the movie, although some pieces were humorous when they weren't supposed to be because the acting wasn't quite deep or real enough, especially Stewart's Bella (she had almost the same ""I'm confused about what's going on"" expression through the entire movie). Then I read all four books over a weekend, getting about four hours sleep total. I have since read the series two more times...I love them, for all that they are not the most well-written books, but because the theory behind them is romantic and intriguing. I saw the movie again after reading the books, and while I still will buy it, it is not quite as good. However, having said that, I can also imagine the inner text from the book going on in the film characters' minds."
4,Pretty good,"Ok I know the book is always better but I thought the movie left out a LOT of good stuff that was in the book. The movie seemed to move REALLY fast. All of that said....they did a pretty good job capturing the effects and all. Rob was and interesting choice for Edward but he does do an awesome job with ""Bella"". Good movie. A must see."
5,book vs. movie question,"I saw the movie and then read the book, and then I read New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn, in order. IMO, I think Twilight could've had more character development. While I know the entire book wouldn't fit in the length of a regular movie, too much was cut out which left me disappointed. I also would like to know why the book had Bella confront Edward about being a vampire while riding in his Volvo and the movie chose to pick the meadow. Anybody know why they changed that setting? There are more love/kissing scenes in the book than on the big screen as well.This is actually a good series of books that I've now read for the second time. What really amazes me is the mass appeal of both the books and movies for all age groups and both males and females. I took my daughters to see Hannah Montana last week and found myself having a Twilight discussion with a teenager while waiting in line for tickets."
2,Embarrassing.,"What a shame. They ruined a beautiful love-story with horrible directing, cheesy acting/poor casting, and a not-well-hidden low budget.Read the book instead."
3,i love the twilight saga!!!!!,"i love the twilight saga, im really just obssesed. thought i must say that te book series is 1000x better, i even read part of the new midnight sun (book 5) on her website, its worth reading, fr those non readers. the movie doesnt even tough the surface of the books, its actually its terrible in comparison. especially on the bella and edward relationship."
4,Finally watched it last week-peer pressure!,"Well, I had no intentions on seeing this movie. Was thinking it was too high school. Then someone who is as critical of movies as I am, told me it was really good. It opened my mind enough to see it one day while sitting at home with nothing to do. After watching it, I blogged on my twitter, etc-I was wrong! It really was such a good movie! The hype is not just hype. I gave it the credit it deserved. It was better than most movies I had seen recently like Drag me to Hell, The Orphan, Paranormal Activity-(boring)..."
2,"Not so bad, but still bad enough.","If I were a female or something similar to that, I'd have liked it more. Granted, I DID like it more than I thought I would. But that's not saying alot.I will say that my fiancée loved it tremendously. There ya go."
3,2 disc blahs,I love the books so I feel obligated to like the movie too. Anyway the 2 disc isn't worth it. There is nothing interesting on the special feature disc and the supposedly extra or extended scenes (all 3) are on the first disc. All in all its your call but i wouldn't waste your money on a 2 disc edition.
2,Disappointed,"The movie was great and arrived on time. The ""extras"" are great. However, we preordered and the purchase was to include a link for a video download to view Twilight on release day. I received the link 5 days later, a big disappointment. We would have been better off purchasing the movie locally. Lesson learned."
2,"Movie was good, service was questionable","I ordered the movie Twilight a month ahead of its release date to ensure I would have a copy for my tween kids. The release was on a Saturday, and on Friday we received an email from Amazon stating that they could not guarantee delivery on the release date, but would offer a free 24 hour rental(online) from Amazon. Feeling releaved, I passed up the opportunity to purchase the DVD as I shopped on Saturday (I saw THOUSANDS of copies). When I came home early evening, I realized that the DVD had not in fact arrived. We had dinner and then I prepared to download the movie from Amazon online. I was put into a ""queue"", I am assuming because of the demand for the download, and as of 10:30 pm my kids still could not view the movie. I ended up having to order it from our local cable company to avoid hysteria from the kids. The movie finally arrived on Monday, however in the future I will never pre-order a movie from Amazon again."
5,Beautiful and Touching,"I did not know what all the fuss was about at first. But now after seeing this wonderful film, I see that the fuss is warranted. A beautiful, touching romantic tale of first love. True love. This movie will make you believe in all that is possible. It will stay with you for days afterwards. And you will watch it again and again."
5,Still Wonderful...,"Every once in while, when I'm feeling low, I pop Twilight in the DVD player and escape to another world. A world where, love is king. The Twilight Series is a delightful fantasy. Forget the vampires, forget the werewolves. The love story between Bella and Edward is classic and always gives you hope for something more. Yeah, I said it, something more. Do your self a favor, forget all the negative speak and just enjoy the purest form of caring and courage."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,This is the first of the Twilight Saga. It is a great movie! I would for sure recommend it to anyone in the world!!
4,Even the stars disrespect this movie,"Twilight [Blu-ray]I've owned this movie for years and watched it countless times. But for the first time that I watched it with commentary from Rob, Kristen and the director. The comments that Rob and Kristen make (especially Rob) gives the impression that they didn't like the movie or their performance in it. And it kind of makes me feel stupid for liking it. Adimittedly it is my least favorite of the movie franchise but they seemed to really hate it. Plus their knowledge on the making of the film seemed very limited. And Rob especially didn't seem to understand what was going on most of the time. Through a lot of the film if they weren't making fun, they were quiet or asking questions they should know the answer to. I hope that they don't do the commentary on the rest of the films. It's a shame that they have such distain for a franchise that made them famous and rich."
4,Not what you expect!,"Though it was a lot different from the book, the story was still engaging. A little disappointed in the acting, I don't believe the actors were allowed to perform at their best."
3,Ok as an Adaptation,As always the movie was not as good as the book. I really enjoyed the books and when I saw the movie I noticed it had a hard time following the book. Robert Pattenson was great as Edward in my opinion. Jacob (I can't remember the actor's name) was great also. Bella was not at all what I thought she would be like. I imagined someone like Amber Tamblyn. All in all I though the movie was good in itself. For someone who doesn't want to read the books it is a great movie....but for those who did it lacks....
4,I'm Torn Because I Loved the Book,"I adored the book, Twilight. I was thrilled when the movie came out and did enjoy watching it. But...if I had not read the book the movie would have made little sense. The love story between Edward and Bella has to move to fast in the movie and it makes no sense that in a matter of days they are inseparable.On it's own merit the movie is confusing with many unexplained elements. One day a girl falls for a guy, he's a vampire and she accepts it as if he told her he likes cheeseburgers. The movie misses the angst and confusion she faced over the move to Washington, meeting this mysterious young man she is drawn to, etc. The movie also missed the slowly blossoming romance between these two loners.I think the movie is a must see if you have the background of reading Twilight. If not a fan of the book, you probably won't find anything here to change that."
4,"The perfect blend of mystery, romance, adventure....with a little comedy thrown in.","Not having read the Twilight series of books, I approached the movie with a totally open mind, yet knowing that it was a teen girl flick. Pleasantly surprised at the story, development of relationships - and, well - the whole premise of vampires attempting to seamlessly blend into modern day society. Very subtle in quaint in some parts, yet just enough action and suspense to keep it moving. Even my 9-yr-old son liked it (instead of making fun of his 13-yr-old sister). OK for families, nothing risque - makes for good dinner table conversation!"
3,A little confused,"I'm not the biggest twilight book fan but, i did want to see the movie. I know it is a big deal and has so much attention but i was disapointed and wasn't the only one. I ordered it on ppv the day after it came out. I read that fans of the book said it was good and close to the story in the book. So it was actually boring i didn't see the chemistry at all between rob and kristen and there characters. It was just quiet and gray which i'm not fond of in movies. And i still find it weird that these vampires stephanie meyer created don't have fangs and the sparkle thing that happens to vamp skin in sunlight is the dumbest thing i have ever seen. But the movies was still average."
3,eh...,"Loved the books, the movies... not so much. They're okay, but books are always better. I feel like too much was switched around and mushed together. Some of my favorite parts in the book were either cut out of the movie or were threw into another part. Maybe I would have liked the movie better if I hadn't read the book first. Oh well."
3,okay for the price,"movie is okay... nothing against the actual movie, the books are just better. its a great product though. super cheap and very good condition"
4,Twilight Collectible,I enjoy the collectible I received. It was in a very nice collectors box and was shipped to me promptly. It was packaged very good to ensure my product was delivered to me undamaged. I wanted a collectos piece of the movie and was happy with my choice.
3,Product Amazing Timing not so good,"When I finally received my product it was in great condition. However,it did take a long time maybe because of the snow storms in my area."
4,Twilight (Two-Disc Special Edition),Movie was good. The book was waaaaayyyyyyy better. Left out too much detail in the movie.
4,"it's twilight, what more is there to say?","i cringe (slightly) everytime i watch certain parts, yet i've seen it at least 10 times now..."
1,twilight,"I tried to rent it, but its not downloading....errrg, i guess i have to wait for mine in the mail too!"
1,Didn't work,I also was not delivered the video on time and I pre-ordered over a month in advance. I used the promo code and received an email saying it went through however now my file that I chose to download to my PC won't work even though when I view the video it says ready to watch. Not worth the time.
1,Get it straight next time,"Note to Amazon: if you don't have an agreement with the studio about when the release date is, then DON'T OFFER it for pre-order if you can't deliver on the release date."
1,disappointment,I was so excited to watch this movie and so disappointed the movie was so bad I am so glad that I rented it on netflix were I am able to return it.
4,Sweet romance,I find the movie horribly disgusting yet I can't help but to like it. I'm completely ashamed of myself for admitting I even like it but it's just one of those guilty pleasure.
5,First time,"A little corney but cute, the actors are not very good but it's ok the movie still gets the point across, I would recommend the movie"
2,Interesting if you're the target audience,"I admit I don't read her work and before this film came out I never heard of her. I found the concept of the film much more interesting than the actual story itself. Stewart and Pattinson have nice on-screen chemistry but the the film slushes along where it should flow evenly. Still, if you were the target audience, this film is perfect. Personally, I prefer Lost Boys or Interview with a Vampire."
4,Book much better than movie.,Bought only because my daughter is in it. Don't like the casting in this movie.
3,A Rip Off Version Of The Book,"I'm glad I saw Twilight last fall when it hit the theatres because it introduced me to the books. However, after reading the books and watching the movie again I can see how flawed this movie was. First of all, plot changes were made that weren't necessary such as Charlie eating out every night instead of Bella cooking for him. This was a huge part of the first book. Secondly, was the murders by the three nomad vampires. Those murders don't exist in the book. Although the movie is visually appealing the characters were nothing like their book versions and many of them were bad casting decisions based on looks alone. I really can't recommend this movie except for the fact that Rob Pattison is so lovely it makes it worth watching just to see him but the director was clearly far more interested in scenic views than the actual plotline of the story. I'm glad she didn't signup to direct New Moon."
2,Awful...,"I read all the books before the movie was even a concept...and I'm kinda bummed I did. After the books the movie was complete let down. They tried to cram all the finer points of the book into a 2 hour movie and failed miserably. The book was rich in detail and the movie wasn't. ""Bella"" had a few voice overs in the movie, but not enough to know what she was thinking or feeling. Mostly, ""Bella"" just looked confused and frustratingly awkward. This is one of those instances where Hollywood took a great story and turned into a mushy Cliff's Notes version. Ugh!"
2,What do you want from a film?,"Do you want a good story, a good work of the actors, a good music, a good director? They can't be found here. But if you have 12-16 years old and you don't want to grow in your taste, well ..."
2,I'll admit it....,"I'll admit it...I have read this series at least two times. With any huge series you expect or at least hope the movie does the book justice. I went into my movie viewing experience expecting the film to be a fraction of what the book was...and i was correct. I think the potential for greatness was missed in Hardwicke being the director. I have watched other films-Thirteen included- and always found her methods to be undeveloped and choppy. In that regard she didn't disappoint. The movie could have shown the development of Bella and Edward's relationship so their devotion to one another was understood. I feel like she and the screen writer took a great plot and skimmed it down so much it was on the verge of terrible. Please don't misunderstand me...I love the books, just not the movie. Had i not had such an attachment to the books i wouldn't own this movie. and i'll be honest, since seeing it in the theaters i haven't watched the dvd-except for the special features."
2,All that glitter and no fangs...,"I come from the Lost Boys generation....and this kind of vampire seems weak in comparison...but I understand this next generation needs new characters so ok...it took me a long time to get into it because of my daughters, but I gave in at least to this first movie...the intensity of their connection seems ok...I like the look and feel of Forks, Washington....I have to give them credit for that... and Bella...BREATHE...she looks like she is holding her breath through out the entire movie..."
1,THIS IS MY NEW NIGHTMARE,"THIS MOVIE SUCKS Really badim not kidding, its slow, very shallow and makes you want your money backBlade needs to be in this movie to slay these stupid vampires"
1,Not even B-Movie quality,"I love vampire movies, so I can generally tolerate either sub-par acting or poor cinematography if the movie involves fangs. Twilight was so bad on both counts, and so lacking in plot and action, that I turned it off after 40 dreary minutes. The book series, however, was very engaging. Hopefully the next movie will be better."
3,Books are way better than the movie!!,"The movie does not even come close to the quality of the books. If you have not read the books or seen the movie. I would recommend reading the books first because you may be disappointed by the movie and not want to read the book based on the negative experience cause by the movie and that would be quite a loss because the books are really good. They are very well written, very interesting and extremely more entertaining than the movie."
3,It was OK,"I wasn't impressed with the acting. However, the geographic areas in Washington State as well that other northwestern areas fit well. Thank you for your attention."
2,Hate letter box,"I Love The Movie,I did not like the letter box. I could not put it in wide screen on my laptop top. I wished that I could get my money back or maybe replace it with a full screen version, but kind not find where to look into that."
1,Don't watch it,I've never watched a movie that was so bad I literally felt depressed afterwards. The first time I was forced to see Twilight all I did was laugh. Now all I can be is depressed. The only reason I watched it a second time was to write a paper on how awful it was but it doesn't even deserve that. I really wish I could take back the time I spent watching this because I seriously could've used it doing something way more productive.
4,better than I thought,"My gf wanted to watch it and I thought it was going to be crap, but it actually was pretty decent. Sure it's full fantasy, but the storyline provides a fresh breath of creativity."
4,Wonderful,An amazing movie with amazing bonus to know more about twilight and this wonderful universe.
4,Twilight,should maybe watch the movie before reading the series. Didn't touch the surface of depth in the way the book was written. But still a good watch.
3,"Honorable option, good flick, unbox isn't quite there though.","First rate of Amazon to come up with a fix for shipping delays, I'm impressed with that part of the deal. It also gave me an opportunity to try Unbox without cost - I'm glad I didn't pay for it.Unfortunately, there's a reason I don't use Unbox. I want to watch movies on my TV/surround for a reason, not really interested in sitting at the computer to watch a movie. I tried to download it on the laptop so I could watch later, but must've hit something wrong. Once it started viewing (not what I wanted), there was no option to go back and get it right - I was stuck with watching it here and now anyway. The concept is good, but needs some help to say the least.I (and my disappointed wife) will be satisfied when the DVD shows up next week. Until then, well, we tried."
5,Just can't get enough....,"Finally, I have my very own copy of fabbo ""Twilight"" - yay! While there's nothing like seeing it on the big movie screen - and getting the full impact of the amazing visuals: mood-enhancing scenery, stunning color palette, and, not least by a long shot: oh-so-easy-on-the eye Rob Pattinson (oh my, that prom look...swoon!) - I'm SO excited to be able to indulge my desire to watch any time I like, now -- and with the added bonus of nobody annoyingly crunching popcorn in my ear, ha! ha!Love it, love it, love it!! Happy! Happy! Happy!"
1,Watch the movie BEFORE you read the book...,"I was so excited for this movie to come out. I purchased today and couldn't wait to get home to watch it. Ugh... what an utter disappointment. The movie is just lame and, even in the beginning, things are different from the book. I'm not going to list anything b/c I don't want to put any spoilers out there. However, what's with the lack of chemistry between Bella and Edward? I think they could have had a better actress play the part of Bella -- but that's just my opinion, I guess. Overall, though, I think the movie would have been better if I hadn't already read the book. What a let down :("
5,Great Flick,"For those of you who have not seen twilight ( I doubt there are many ), you're missing a great flick. This movie is not only for the teens, but ages 13-80,and in between. Reading the book first is a plus. I'm 66 years of age & my grandaughter was so interested I started reading the whole series. Now I can hardly wait for the second movie to be released. Even my 20 year old grandson is reading the series. I've seen the movie 3 times at the theatre & as I now own it I'm enjoying it at home."
4,Most erotic scene ever in a movie,"I just rented Twilight and have to agree with many of the criticisms. But I've never seen a more erotic scene in a movie, the very last one, where she begs to be bitten, and leans her neck back to accept it. The look on Edward's face, boring into her with his eyes, and nearly drooling with desire - giving her a long deep kiss on the neck instead - with that Flightless Bird song playing as backdrop - I am still knocked out by the eroticism of that. It was the saving grace of this film. I fell head over heals for the vampire at that point....no going back."
5,Fun Movie to Watch,"This is a fun movie to watch. Sure it's a little rough around the production edges here and there, but for me the storyline and the actors more than made up for it. (And yes, I'm way past my teenage years.) The extra features are fun. I always like to see deleted scenes. I'd say it's worth getting the special edition if you don't already own the movie. If you already own this, but not with the special edition features, I'm not sure it would be worth it to get this too, unless you are a really passionate fan of Twilight."
3,Greasy Kid's Stuff,"I finally got around to watching Twilight on DVD. Its pretty much what I thought it would be. If you are a 14 year-old female Goth fan, then Twilight is like visual crack. This film has got all the right elements: a brooding female character, her romance with a brooding male teenage vampire, a dark cloudy atmosphere and the spectre of death.Goth girls will love the plot: Dour teenage girl moves to a Northern Pacific town and meets a gloomy teenage boy who just happens to be a vampire. He says things like ""I am a monster"" while courting the Goth chick. This is a very pro-vampire film. Twilight features no fangs, no turning into a bat nor a wolf, no steaking and no capes. There is some blood, sepia-toned flashbacks and a scene involving a vampire baseball game.Is Twilight worth your time? I've seen worse. If you are in the mood for this light, predictable drama, then you should check out Twilight."
2,Disapointing,"After reading all 4 books and the partial draft of midnight sun, all in 4 days i couldn't believe how great the books were... I fell in love with this series even though it is based towards teen girls. The movie however failed. They jumbled the sequence of events in the movie, and lets face it the acting was pretty shotty... i mean come on even the ""i know what you did last summer"" acting was better than rob. Now I loved the books and have read them quite a few times but the movie falls short! I'm sorry but the director made it look like more of a music video than a movie, and i got lost with the other characters. I hope that the next movie is better now that there is a new director. I wasn't hoping for a coen brothers flick, but i was hoping for better acting and better follow through from book to movie. (kristen stewart did embody bella perfectly though) PLEASE DO A BETTER JOB.... please..."
2,spend your money on the books not the movie!,"After having read all the books and seeing the movie I'd say buy the books and rent the movie when it comes out. The movie is mediocre but the books are good (if you can get past Bella being such a weak, wimpy character. Not a great role model for girls. She often faints, falls down alot and apologizes all the time. A bit of a doormat in my opinion) But if you like vampire/paranormal romance it is a must read. Chaste but romantic."
3,Team Jacob,"I never heard of Twilight before, until one day I was looking up Kirsten Stewarts filmography up on (IMDB) And I saw her film Twilight and I heard there was a book So I decided to read the book first and I fell in love with it, I finished all four in like a month. The movie was ok, I didn't like it that much they skipped alot of the stuff from the book and changed it. Edward and Bella didn't have chemistry to me, Like they had to be together. In the book I'm sooooo team Edward, but in the movie I'm team Jacob. The only reason Why I will go see New Moon is because of Jacob. If it wasn't for Charlie, Emmett, Alice, Jasper, and Rosalie the movie would seriously bombed."
5,Loved the Movie Without Reading the Books,"I had not read any of the books before I saw the movie and I loved the movie. I really loved the acting and the music, everything about it. To me it is more of a love story that is beautifully done. I have now read the books and enjoyed them also. It helped to have faces to put on the book characters. I know they are going to make changes when they do the next movie but I have a feeling this will always be my favorite. If you love romance movies and kind of like vampires in them, this is the movie for you."
4,Mediocre adaptation but watchable.,"The movie is good, not better than the book but it hits all the key points. Like most book to movie conversions, there is a lot of stuff that isn't explained so I recommend reading at least book 1 in the Twilight series wait a couple weeks then watch the movie or you are likely to be comparing the movie to the book (like i did) when watching it. I watched the movie a couple times after that and I was more comfortable with the actors portrayals. Definitely a romantic vamp movie. Don't compare to any Anne Rice novels this is in a category of its own. It's a guarantee you will want it in your collection if you are a Vamp movie buff.Enjoy!"
3,Un poco decepcionante...,"Realmente esperaba mucho mas de una edicion especial, como la pelicula con las escenas extendidas, y no como extras para verlas aparte..."
1,damaged,the disc arrived damaged. the disc was packed incorrectly and partially out of slot. The movie was scratched and skipped. I returned it and hope to have a refund soon.
3,Surprisingly decent,"First off, I must say I've never read the books and don't plan to. My only expectations were that I'd heard a lot of negative things about this movie. That being said I was bored to tears for the first hour then all of the sudden the movie got interesting. I started enjoying it to my amazement! It's still not the best vampire movie out there (this is no Underworld). There are also many things about vamps in this film that I didn't care for (walking around in daylight, sparkling in sunlight, etc.), but all in all this isn't too bad a movie."
2,Second disc not dubbed right,"I loved the movie. However, the second disc is not properly dubbed and the voices DO NOT match the picture. This is very aggrivating for the deleted scenes. I would not recommend buying this DVD, Target had the three disc for the same price minus the shipping!"
3,Twilight DVD,"Film is incomparable with books but Kirsten Stewart plays very well. Good DVD edition. But the spanish language is from latinamerica, not from Spain. Please, specify. I'm from Spain and now I need sell it"
5,Twilight,"What can i say, its a great movie, good value, received and cherished by my daughter--all around a great purchase."
3,very good,"DVD was in excellent condition. Case was cracked, when I received it. I'm assuming it was broken in transit. Better shipping materials should be used."
4,"Good movie, better as a book","If you look at it as just the movie, it's ok. Having read the series first though, too many things were changed."
5,"I mean, do I even have to review this?","Seriously, the movie is great. I can't say enough about it, so I'll just talk about my Amazon experience. I pre-ordered it and got a better deal than what I thought I was getting originally (saving money = awesome) and originally it wasn't going to get to my house by the release date, but Amazon put a free version on their website that you could access if you'd pre-ordered the movie, so I didn't have to wait to see it! I thought that was extraordinary service."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"I'm a fan of vampire films; however, not having read the book and going simply on all the pre-release hype I was disappointed to learn this was a film about teenage vampires. The special effects were well done - however, in the over-abundant extras on the DVD, I quickly grew tired of listening to the self-indulgent comments of the director. She should have let others speak more while she stopped running her mouth - maybe she could have done a better job at directing. Still - I look forward to what most certainly will be a sequel, teenagers and all."
1,Keep Wooden Stakes Handy When Approaching This Movie,"Only barely post-pubescent girls can be excused for declaring this movie ""good."" Adults and the ""Twilight Moms"" that callously dare to sing this movies' praises are clearly just interested in Hollywood's latest male cheesecake and aren't objectively reviewing the film itself. The two main characters have the chemistry equivalent of rust, and the film itself the charisma of Ben Stein's character in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" Between the choice of watching this writing-deficient offal again and committing suicide, I'd really have to think long and hard which I'd choose. Final review: 122 minutes of pure unadulterated suck punctuated by numerous periods of mind-numbing boredom. I've seen the previews to ""New Moon"" by the way, and, though I haven't seen it (and never will), judging from the previews, I'm pretty sure the filmmakers have outdone themselves with an even worse film. One wonders how that was even possible."
5,Addicting! Highly recommended,"Never paid too much attention to all the fan fair. However, when New Moon was about to be released a friend explained the hype and recommended the film. I went out and purchased Twilight- and have been addicted ever since. I think the hook for me was the longing that Edward has for Bella. I have since read all the books, including Morning Sun."
3,The Book Is Much Better,This movie is fine but the book is outstanding. If you like the movie you will love the book.
1,A love-story so sickening you would puke if it were real,"All the while that Kristen Stewart is playing the very 2-D role of Bella Swan and looking as if she has chronic stomach pains, Rob Pattinson keeps confirming the fact that he makes for a very horrible vampire as well as a very unattractive one at that. We've seen all this before, the constant struggle to not feed on human blood and the consequences of falling in love with a human while being gorgeous, immortal, and practically indestructible was fully and far more artfully covered by Anne Rice and her more believable and thought-provoking characters of the Vampire Chronicles."
5,Twilight,I Loved Twilight i bought it and now all i do is watch it when i have time (which is about twice a day) I cannot choose one part that i liked because i thought it was a great movie the songs were great the action was fantastic the scenery was beautiful.
3,It's okay,"Shipping super fast! Disk not scratched or damaged but first disk wasn't in the case properly and was ""roaming freely"" in the case. There was damage to the front cover. As a collector of Twilight stuff, thats important, but it will suffice. Thanks again"
2,Not nearly as good as the book,I think they could have found better actresses and actors for this film. The series of books was amazing. I was very disappointed in this movie and I do not think I will watch the others
1,More frustrating than what it's worth.,"I pre-ordered Twilight and was somewhat disappointed that it didn't show up today, because I have pre-ordered from Amazon before and have received DVDs on the release date. I was pleased that Amazon was offering a free video on demand because of the delay, but like most, my code doesn't work. I called support, and waited over 20 minutes to get somebody who couldn't fix the problem and had to be put on hold again to transfer to somebody else. If Amazon is going to offer promos like this, that's great, just make sure it's going to work before disappointing thousands of fans."
1,"Online playing of movie doesn't work - now, not allowed to download...","Online stream doesn't play smoothly at all - nonstop jerking of steam though the audio work. Messages says I can't download since I selected to view online - that makes no sense. There should be a 10-minute window for - online viewing not working, please download - You get what you pay for."
2,Bad!,"I saw this movie and was really disappointed - it was like a really, really bad MTV reality show. That's saying alot because they are all bad. Hopefully, the directorof the next movie will somehow get it right or maybe the actors will learn to what's that word ""act"". If all else fails they should get the director of Underworld to direct this way the special effects will be interesting enough to take your mind off how badly it sucks"
1,One of the worst book to movie renditions I've ever seen,"I'm a huge fan of the books (have read them twice already) but the movie is one of the worst I've seen. Too bad really because the great story gave it so much potential. The first problem was that they didn't stick to the book and actually cut some of the best parts of it. If you have such a huge fan base, why change what we loved? Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are perfect examples of not messing too much with a good thing. The acting was just horrible. Where was the grace and elegance? No charming banter - no sexy strong confidence in Edward. What a waste. What was the author thinking I wonder."
2,Twilight,"I just watched the film and quite frankly don't understand what the all the hype about this film is. I guess if this is what 13 year old girls are watching then they must be just as annoying. Thankfully, I am not one of those.The girl is annoying, why would anyone care to be her friend or even befriend her. She is unsympathetic, rude and plain irritating. The acting between the two leads doesn't make me care about them. The plot boring. It tries too hard to be 'dark' but doesn't succeed. Frankly, I'd just wish he tear her throat out and drink her blood and be then end of the series. Can I say thank-you fast-forward.I give it 2 stars for the fact, it didn't deserve a 1 star. I'm just glad I didn't have to sit through this movie in the theater. I guess it could be worst, I could have been sitting through the Jonas Brother 3D."
2,Twilight,I got my two dis set and there is something wrong with it. It skips scenes and i did't even get the e- mail with the code in it to watch it on line until i set my copy back to recieve a new one!!
1,Disappointing - is all i can say,"Well i read the book and was really looking forward to this movie. And now that i have seen it i have to say that we all lost another chance for a great movie.Dont get me wrong, the actors were ok but not the right once for this movie. There is realy no magic between them, which is the one thing a bookadaptation like that needs. The only character i liked was Ashley Greene who did a good job. The weak script and poor tricks were certainly not helping either. The whole thing looks to me like a incoherent line of scene which were glued together by some amateur, needless to say what the result is, a poor movie, something u watch to pass the time but nothing more.I get really scared when i think about the other books from this series, and what these butchers will do to them when they turn them into movies.My advice, buy the books and dont waste your money on a movieticket or even worth, the DVD."
1,Garbage for Garbage.,People that are into these kinds of fads need to be put on an island and left to their own devices. CULL THE HERD.
1,You've got to be kidding,"Nothing happens in this movie!The only entertaining parts of the movie was the baseball scene where there was something actually happening other than lame dialogue that is worse than the romantic dialogue in Attack of the Clones, and the fight at the end in the ballet studio. Other than that the movie was boring as hell.Not to mention that vampires aren't really scary when they share things in common with My Little Pony, i.e. sparkling in the sunlight.Glad I only rented this and didn't buy it or see it in theaters."
1,"""Where for art thou, Edward?""","In the tradition of such storied romances as ROMEO and JULIET and TITANIC's Jack and Rose comes TWILIGHT, a not-so-simple tale of boy-meets-girl when said boy turns out to be a vampire! Brooding Edward Cullen only has eyes for sheltered good-girl Bella Swan, yet their love is doomed from the start, for although Edward is unquestionably the finest hunk of undead flesh ever to walk the earth, he still has to pass gas. Will Bella's wholesome heart and tireless devotion be enough to purge Edward of the flatulent fires burning within him, or will night fall and cast a dirty, lingering pall over their love like a child with a disposable diaper?"
2,This movie does not do the book justice,I know the book is always better but I think this movie just doesn't capture the characters very well. The characters seems dull and the action in this movie is rushed and boring. I think Twilight would have made a better TV series than a movie.
4,Twilight Paperback Book,"Seller delivered what was promised and in a timely matter. I have read all the Twilight books before (borrowed from friend) but decided to read them again after watching the movie ""Eclipes"". I forgot how good the books are until now. As great as the movies are, they have nothing on the writting, simply because they have to cut out so mych in order to make it 2 hours."
4,"OK - good movie, but...","With all the hype given to this (these) movies, I had a different expectation of the movie itself. It was good though a bit of a disappointment. Not near as exciting as I expected."
3,My favorite of the series...,"I was a fan of the first two books in this series, but the movies were really disappointing. Twilight was my favorite of the films and the only one that really feels like it showcases the love story between Edward and Bella.I was so happy to find this Target two-disc version here on amazon. Now, I can watch my favorite scenes in HD. I could no longer find it on Target's website or in their stores. This edition is filled with more special features than the traditional blu-ray release."
2,Lame acting killed love story,I was surprised by the poor acting of lead actors. These super intense kissing scenes...I don't know... the way Edward kisses Bella... it looks like he really needs to pee or something like that.For my taste the movie is too melodramatic and whiny. There are some cool scenes though. Probably watching it on a big screen would be more fun.
3,Good movie if you've had no expectations,"Just an FYI for you guys: The DVD does not come with the nice little booklet like most other DVDs. It's just the 2 DVDs in the case.I bought this JUST for the deleted scenes, but it wasn't really worth it as there weren't many and they were extremely short."
5,Good Movie,"I rented this on my Tivo. A great movie even if a little ""dark"". I have no children at home, but feel an adult should watch it with them."
3,"I enjoyed it..... no sex, but an entertaining movie","I enjoyed the movie. My teenage daughter absolutely despises the whole series, but she is a quirky elitist. It was sweet, although a bit much for teenage love. But, that's entertainment. Can't wait to see the next installment."
5,Still in wrapper,"This Blu Ray arrived still in its shrink-wrap, as advertised. I haven't watched it yet ..."
4,Wow,"Wow, i didn't think that i would like this movie, i didn't read the books till after i got the movie but it was good. i can't wait till New moon is out. Team Jacob, all the way."
2,So Disappointed :(,"I just finished reading the entire Twilight Saga, and as a woman in her early thirties I was surprised by how much I thoroughly enjoyed the story! I decided to take a chance on the movies. I was unable to find the first movie Twilight at any Redbox within 25 miles, so I opted to purchase for 14.99 on Amazon on Demand. The connection & clarity of the service was Great; too bad the movie was AWFUL ;(. I realize movie adaptations are entirely different than the books on which they are 'loosely' based, and for the most part I can usually enjoy each story on its own. However, this movie version was wooden, lame, and completely lacked the intensity of the novel. I recommend waiting until you can find a .99 rental! I think the other 3 movies in the series are better than this first installment (or maybe I just severely lowered my expectations)."
2,"The book was so good, the movie was so bad...","I loved this series of books and was so looking forward to the movies. Unfortunately, this movie didn't live up to the book. The movie is like a bad 80s ""b"" movie and cheesy. I imagined that Edward was a true romantic but didn't get that from the movie. I'm still going to watch the other movies, but with very little expectation."
4,2-disc deluxe edition?,"i have received a plain twilight edition. not a two disc deluxe edition. thankfully it was still a blue-ray. i wish people weren't misadvertising their staff!! i was still happy to get it, the disc played fine. whats up with fake ads?"
1,Bootleg Copies!,"This review is for the box set itself!There are people selling bootleg copies of this 3 DVD Deluxe Edition on Amazon! Originally when this set came out it was a Target Exclusive... It came with a outer slip cover, the dvd case had 3 dvd trays and was very durable... When I tried ordering the set I had noticed that the price was extremely cheap... At first I thought it was because it's been out 3 years and it wasn't at the $30.00 price tag anymore... However when I happen to notice the seller's feedback, people have said that the 3 dvds come in paper sleeves and placed in a regular dvd case... I SMELL BOOTLEG! So I cancelled my order and thought I should warn people... And give a heads up to Amazon..."
3,Not sure,"I enjoyed this movie after seeing it a few times. Being a huge fan of the books, I hated the movie the first time I saw it. It has since grown on me and I have watched it many times. The exact item I received in the mail came in a paper sleeve. I am not sure if it is an actual blu-ray or a copy of a blu-ray. I will be more careful with my future blu-ray purchases."
5,Twilight,The first time that I saw the movie I thought it was ok. Then I bought the books and then rewatched the movie. I found that after reading the books it make the movie Great since you could basically fill in the small details that the movie left out.
5,wonderful,"AS with everything ""Twilight"" this is a must have, even if you dont have a bluray player, you might get one in the future so why not now?"
3,"Bad movie, good eye candy","Let's be real...this movie sucks. The writing, acting, and plot leave more than expected to the imagination. But one thing is for sure....RPattz is hot, and that is the only reason I watch this movie. New Moon was actually really good, and am excited for that to come on DVD. But this one is going in the collection for sheer eye-candy reasons. ;)"
5,very nice movie,"Twilight is a very scary movie. I love this movie. I was thrilled when the characteis faces changed ,when they turned in to animals ,and when they fought. I think another people will love it when they watch. New moon is the second part of the Twilight movie. I vecommend this movie to any one who likes vampires"
3,I liked the movie until....,"Until I read the book....I started off with the movies and it wasn't until I saw new moon that I had any desire to read the book...After reading the first book there was so so much that was left out.I'm not even talking about bulk, I'm talking passion. The intimacy between Edward and Bella was missing in the movie.There was only a hint of it in the movie while the book was packed full of it. How and why would a director choose to leave that out is beyond me. Glad to see they didn't bring her back to direct new moon...This movie is ok, but no where near what the book is..."
1,I never received it,"The movie was wonderful in the cinema, but I never received my purchase from Lola Teacher, so I cannot give a review of the item.I am sorely disappointed."
5,dvd,"It was great to find this at a price I could afford to get it as a gift, recipient very pleased to receive it."
3,"loved the books, but...","All I can say about the movie is that it wasn't as horrible as I expected. I loved the books. When I read they cast Rob Pattinson as Edward I was so disappointed-- I find him very unattractive and unappealing and disliked him intensely when he played Cedric Diggory in the Harry Potter movie. And Kristin Stewart is so unattractive as well. But the scenery was awesome, and I really liked the scene in the tree--very cool. Like I said, not as bad as I expected it to be."
3,Eh,The movies always disappoint you when coming from a much beloved series. I found this movie lacking. Of course I'm hard to please when it comes to making books into movies.
5,It is the best movie ever,Was sooooooo good it was almost as good as breaking dawn part 2 and that was the best movie ever.
5,I love this CD,I love the music on all the twilight movies. I have every soundtrack and every movie. They picked great artists
1,Horrible,"This movie is just plain silly. Vampires hanging out in high school hitting on less than legal teenage girls? The vampires all tried to dress semi cool/edgy see also as(homosexually.) It's a trashy plotless, rehashed love novel with vampires of questionable sexual orientation. If you like this crap you need to probably get out of the house more often."
1,HORRIBLE,"I can't even talk about it, it makes me that mad.This movie couldn't have been worse....My favorite character had 2 lines in the whole movie (Jasper) and there's an entire list of actors that had no acting abilities WHATSOEVER in this movie. Did I mention that the special effects looked about as bad as the cheap sci-fi movies on the Sci Fi channel?This movie could have been so much better... I REALLY REALLY REALLY hope that the Maximum Ride series doesn't come out as bad as this one is."
2,Twilight Movie is DUMBED DOWN version of novel,"While I enjoyed the book ""Twilight"", I felt that the suspense was really lacking in the movie. For even those who didn't read the books, the movie seemed formulaic and totally predictable. It was almost like the director felt that he had to really dumb down and sterilize the movie in order for his target audience (teenage girls), to be able to understand it. Quite frankly, I think they should feel insulted at how elementary the movie was translated from the novel. Unfortunately, I saw this on opening day and all the female audience seemed to care about was oggling at Robert Patterson and ""OooOOOoooing"" every time he appeared on the screen. Maybe the director was right and depth of plot and suspense DON'T matter to the target audience. Overall, I was very disappointed with this movie and doubt that I will go to the theater to see any others in this franchise..."
5,Great Movie,I hope all four books are made into movies. I went to see twilight five times and cant wait for the dvd.
2,Have NOT seen the movie...,"BUT i have read the twilight series many times over and enjoyed every second. After seeing the trailor and that Kristen Stewart was going to play Bella i had zero interest in seeing the movie, knowing that it most likely will be full of holes, not as passionate and directed toward the pre-teen/teen audience. Now that it's release is nearing i don't think i will be able to help myself, i will most likely give it a try but my expectations are low and i could tell just by the bits i saw on youtube that the movie is definately missing...something. I just hope New Moon will redeem the Twilight saga and make for the wonderful world i invision while reading the book. Now i guess i just wait for Midnight sun...ooops where not suppose to talk about it, i forgot ;p"
1,How utterly disappointing!,"This movie was a huge disappointment. Everything about it was all wrong...the cast, the scenes, the story. I saw the movie after reading the first two books and I was absolutely shocked and dumbfounded with the HORRIBLE acting and the less-than-stellar casting job. Kristen Stewart ruined Bella's character and there was absolutely nothing about Robert Patterson to fall in love with. Watching the movie was depessing after having loved the book so much. I was really afraid after watching it that these were the people that were going to be in my head when I read the last two books because I knew it would ruin it for me. Thankfully, I somehow blocked the faces of the untalented actors out and was able to still enjoy Eclipse and Breaking Dawn. If I were Stephenie Meyer, I would be heartbroken over the slaughtering of her book into a movie. I would never spend the money on this movie and I will not go to see the next one that comes out. I'll stick to books with this series...."
1,stupid stupid stupid,idk how people enjoyed this movie if your a fan of vamps then def stay away first off hey glitter in the sunlight? who are they liberachi vamps? stupid movie
1,It Bites!!,"If you actually read the book, then you will find the movie AWFUL!! I bought this thinking that it wouldn't be great, but I didn't think that it was going to be 2 hours of absolute crap. I think movies should be true to their origins and this was definitely not a good representation of the book. Even if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have found this movie entertaining or enjoyable in the least."
1,this movie is terrible,i hate this movie it stinks theirs no plot no charecter development and all the charecters are cut board cut outs none of the actors have chemistry with each other either this movie stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the book series stinks to do not waste your money on this buy something else instead
5,Twilight,This is a classic movie that I am sure many people already have purchased since the first one had been made. I am also sure the actors never had anticipated the success of the series. I recommend this seller highly.The movie was used but in excellent condition and also was shipped the one with the bonus features.A great deal!
1,Disappointed,I would have loved to see the movie but the promotional code didn't work. If your going to do something like these you should make sure it works. I'm very disappointed.
1,Not Working !!!,"I would have loved to have seen the movie this weekend, but I couldn't get it to work. I tried the promotional code several times to no avail. It would have been nice. I'll have to wait for the UPS driver to bring it to me tomorrow. Bummer."
1,Wow that was bad...,"You know, I've never seen a movie where the ENTIRE cast phones in their parts more or less. Out of all of the actors, I only have heard of three and had seen them in something other then Twilight, and I know at least one of them can act.The script for the movie took what was bad from the book and just made it worse; you can tell that this was just a paycheck for the actors, and that they didn't really care about the movie. And that they were working with a bad script made from a mediocere book..."
2,CHEESY! Almost painful to watch,"I'm a fan of the Twilight books, but OH! This just hurt to watch! EXTREMELY cheesy, everything forced, just corny, ugh, it is just uncomfortable to think about.If you haven't read the books--don't start with the movie! If you like the books, rent the movie if you must just to see Edward and Bella in the flesh.Only reason I gave the movie 2 stars is because of the Baseball Scene--much cooler than I had imagined when I read the books. Other than that--ouch.I suggest just looking at pictures of scenes to go along with what you read, and skip actually watching the movie."
1,Crappiest movie ever,"Please, do not watch this movie! The acting is horrible, and so are the special effects. Many of the good Edward and Bella scenes from the book have been taken out or horribly rearranged. I saw the movie in theaters and had to fight to keep from laughing through it. I don't understand why it is getting all of this hype, because in all honesty, it was a total piece of crap. I thought Stephanie Meyer wanted the movie to portray the book correctly, but it doesn't at all. I almost feel embarrassed for her, for I am certainly embarrassed to say I saw this movie."
1,Sadly disappointed,"After having read the whole series and then watching the movie, I was sadly disappointed. The acting was horrible, the story line was incomprehensible - the heroine is supposed to be a klutz, and yet it shows her falling one time on the driveway?After the attack on Bella by James, in the book Edward is trying to save her life, in the movie Carlisle, has to tell Edward to stop because ""he's killing her."" Sheesh.I think if there are going to be additional movies made for this saga, they need to give the ""stars"" acting lessons, and stick closer to the story line.My 10 year old daughter even thought it was horrible! She thought the guy who played Jasper was the best actor in the movie, and he only had one sentence!"
2,sadly disappointed,I bought the movie hoping it would be decent since the books had been wonderful. Now I wish I could return it. The acting sucked and they edited out most of the love scenes and other important plot points. The only characters they even remotely kept similar is Edward and Bella. They completely changed Esme's story as well as Jasper and Rosalie. I am so disappointed.
3,"Poor special effects, good extra features","This is not a great movie by any means. However, I really enjoy watching it, if that makes any sense. The special effects are awful, particularly when Edward runs or jumps. So what makes the movie enjoyable to watch? Robert Pattinson is the perfect Edward in my mind. For non-readers of the book series, Kristen Stewart appears whiney and morose. Some of it is really campy.One bonus that this dvd set has is its Spanish language track. It's great to be able to watch this movie in multiple languages. I really wish more dvds had a Spanish language track, not just subtitles. The extended scenes are really not as ""extended"" as one would hope. The making of the movie feature is interesting. Overall, I think it is a good value for the $17.99 I paid for it. If you're looking for an Oscar-contender, this is NOT for you."
4,Ultimate guilty pleasure movie...,Twilight does not have the best acting yet the story is captivating. These movies are my guilty pleasure. I can't wait for Breaking Dawn to come out.
1,Bad acting and to many Pauses. One word: Rifftrax lol,"I hate vampires, the only thing i watched this for was the hilarious Rifftrax commentary making fun of it, which make's the movie great when it's being mocked. Bella needs to take some kind of language class, she pauses to much. No doubt devote fans are going to attack me, but whatever, their souls their loss of taste."
1,Item should be called Ultimate Twilight Ripoff,"I purchased the Twilight Ultimate Collector's set, sold mainly on the jewelry box that ""appears"" to have a mirror. Turns out the box was made of cardboard with aluminum ""hinges"" and arrived broken apart. The mirror was a shiny plastic. The compartments were also plastic. Who ever heard of placing jewelry in a cardboard box. Lol. The watch didn't work, even after putting my own battery in. The charm bracelet appeared tarnished. Bookmark and scene photos were nice, TOTALLY worth 80 dollars! The blu-ray and soundtrack worked; that impressed me. Bottomline: don't buy this product...its a total waste of money! Get the blu-ray and soundtrack separately on Ebay for [...]."
1,"Silly,Stupid, and boring","Why did i not like this movie..Let me count the ways..Firstly..i am quite fond of vampires all types of vampires...but these pretty boys all looked prettier than the girls in the movie.. This movie was Made for the females of our species (of which i love dearly)but not for me..a male.The so-called love in this movie seems to be shallow and very obsessive..and that is not a good thing..I suggest Mommies and girls like this movie cause they don't feel loved by their husbands or boyfriends at this moment in time.I like the ""Underworld"" trilogy of vampire movies more than this Chick Flic...and girls do yourself a favor..go look for some badboys to lust over in the real world...."
1,Absolutely Awful!,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It doesn't even deserve a one star rating. The characters are scruffy and unkempt, look and act as if they're groggy most of the time, there was not one memorable or intelligent line in the whole script, the ""hero"" had lipstick on and a weird hairdo (what do they see in that guy?) and the story was nightmarish and simply stupid. In the old horror vampire movies I used to watch as a child, the vampire ended with a stake through his heart at the end. This turkey should have ended on the cutting room floor with a stake through its pathetic and disgusting little heart also. Sick, sick, sick!"
4,Fairly well done,"I went and saw Twilight the weekend that it came out and I really liked it. Of course if you watch this movie expecting it to be directly like the book, you are going to be disappointed. But honestly how can you fit a nearly 500 page book into two hours...it can't be done. They picked the most important scenes to film and they did the best that they could with the budget that they had.I was extremely excited about the movie when I first heard about it, and I think that it was done as well as could be expected. What should really matter most is not what a lot of people are saying, which is that ""it didn't hold true to the story."" According to interviews with Meyers, the movie was excellent, the cast was great, and she really liked what the producers did. To me that is what matters, that she liked what was done.I cannot wait for the next movie to come out!!"
1,Really?!?!,"Not only this movie, but all of the movies in this series have got to be the worst movies in the history of cinema. The acting is easily to worst I have ever see. The storyline is laughable and incredibly insulting to the sci-fi and monster movie history. This is literally based around an extremely overdramatic teenage girl caught in a love triangle between a vampire and werewolf.....Really?!?! In addition they decided to have vampires sparkle....yes sparkle, like a bad Kesha music video. When the werewolves turn they literally look like pokemon cartoon wolves, you almost want to pet them or ride them but definetly not be scared of them. These are a slap in the face to the classic werewolf and vampire movies of our time. How can anyone watch these and think of them as anything but comedies?"
2,The book was so much better.,The acting was not that great. Also the characters were not developed enough in the movie. I recommend you read the book and leave it at that.
4,Not just a chick flick...,"I was reserved about seeing this movie because my 14 year old cousin told me he was 1 of 4 guys in the theater when he went...I was surprised. Although it is filled with young actors, appealing to the teeny boppers, the plot and the underlying themes are pretty grown-up...Vampires and some great action and fight scenes and it wasn't too long...All in all, 4 of 5."
5,Captivating,"Because of the age difference in our kids 18 and 12 (both boys) it's hard to find a movie that we're all interested in... well this one fits the bill. On a Friday night we sat in the theatre amongst a sea of teenage girls... (I wondered if this was going to be our kind of movie) my husband just rolled his eyes. We all loved it, I went directly to the book store and purchased Twilight. Within a month I'd read each book sharing stories with co-workers (ages ranging from 28 to 65) and its been the book series that has united us all. I'm now reading The Host, I'm a fan for life!"
2,"Eh, I'd pass on this movie if I were you","In all honesty, I mainly fast-forwarded through this movie because it was so boring. None of the vampires were menacing nor frightening & the fact that they could be seen out in daylight was absolutely ridiculous. Also, if you are a 300 year old vampire (or however Edward was supposed to be), would you really waste your time going back to highschool again? If you want to see a good vampire movie, check out Interview With A Vampire or even better yet, read the entire series by Anne Rice & put this baby-stuff aside.Robert Pattinson is sexy though, so I gave it two stars just for him, but other than that the movie sucks."
5,Good,"The movie was good and how he protected her from the evil ones in the show and didn't let her get hurt. I hear the book tells more detail, but I like to watch instead of read. I like the romance in this movie."
2,Twilight Download,"I was really excited when I got the link for the free download. I knew my pre-ordered dvd wouldn't be delivered for a couple of days, so I thought the free download was reasonable; however, i was upset when halfway through the movie, it froze and had to continue downloading. Now I'm just sitting here waiting for it to finish so I can finish watching the movie."
2,some what slow and boring,"this movie started off pretty slow for the first 30 minutes into the movie, but it than later began to become a little intresting as the movie continued! this movie wasnt your average vampire flick, so if any of you out there thought you was getting a good blood and guts flick.................sorry...this movie was about teens falling in love and vampires that will not die in the sun!"
2,What about the dudes?,"This product completely neglects the fact that there will be fans who aren't 13 year old girls. Not offering a regular version or more gender neutral collectors edition is silly. Also, all you people belly aching over the release date, thanks. You're whining got the release date pushed for everyone. I had a preorder with best buy, who I was told was one of two retailers to get the product march 21, well now it's May 5th for the regular BD. Thanks alot."
4,A little difficult but manageable,I too was happy to receive the promo. I had a little problem at first but it is now downloading. Thank you Amazon as I will be watching Twilight in approximately 15 minutes! I have read the books over and over and have really enjoyed them.
3,All that glitters...,I was so excited to find that Amazon.com was offered a free 24 hour rental with purchase of the Twilight movie. This freebie is entirely the reason I purchased from Amazon rather than going to the stores searching for this movie. I was very disappointed to find out that my total download time was over 18 HOURS (on my brand new computer)!!! Guess I'll be watching this movie tomorrow.
4,Unhappy with shipping!,"Amazon was able to get my last 2 Harry Potter books to me on the day of release--why not a smaller, lighter DVD?? I'm sure that shipping the DVD to arrive on release date would cost less than the value of the $3.99 preview that my computer says will take 4 hours to download!! Sorry, Amazon, you dropped the ball on this one!!"
3,For readers in the Twilight zone age,"By Twilight Zone age, I mean this book is too old for kids under 14.. and too young for seasoned readers like me, however I still got hooked. Am waiting the third set in series. The movie follows the book quite well but I really didn't care for the leading actors chosen for these roles. Sets were great but leading actors really needed to complete their acting classes."
3,Twilight,"The movie was alright. I prefer the book. I know they couldn't fit in everything from the book into the movie, but I think they could have done better. I do think, however, that the movie was cast beautifully, especially Jacob's character. And the disk with the special behind the scence stuff is good."
4,Good Enuff!,"I got exactly what I was expecting from this video. No, it wasn't ""as good as"" the book, but it had a nice internal logic that it stuck to and it got the necessary points across. My biggest complaint visually would be the ""speed running"" sequences. They just looked kind of silly and didn't come close to capturing the sense of abandon described in the book. Other visuals were compelling, though. My 8-year old loves ""vampire baseball""! Overall, I'd rate the movie as more than decent. Certainly worth a view."
2,Movie won't play!,"Very excited to download the free rental, which took 24 hours over a wireless connection on a laptop, video said it was ready to watch but will not play on this Amazon Unbox Video that I also had to download! So frustrated! Guess I'll just have to wait till the video gets here by snailmail!"
2,Slowly,"I'm really excited Amazon is giving people who bought the video a chance to see it before they get it. The problem is, I've been downloading it for 7 hours already and it's only at 28.7% so far. By the time it finishes, I'll have the disks I bought. It was the thought that counts."
4,Nice gift-or so I was told-,"I purchase this for a xmas present for my ex-wife, my understanding is she loves it, so I guess the purpose was accomplish. But then again you cant go wrong if you give anything it has to do with this saga"
5,Absolutely LOVED,I will recommend this product to my friends! I will be buying this again very soon for my best friend! She is going to have a cow!
3,Not sure,It skips on my computer. I don't know if it's just the computer or if the dvd is just way scratched. I have yet to try it on my dvd player.
1,Twilight,"If you're a sucker for disrespectful children, teenage angst, a slow moving plot, poor acting, and implausible special effect, this is a great movie. If not, then pick another movie. This is a movie that will make you cry - you spent 2 hours collecting dust waiting for the movie to get halfway interesting. I haven't been so excited to see the closing credits in quite a long time."
1,Twilight 2 disc,I have a problem with this purchase. The CD skips in 2 parts. I cleaned it but it still skips. I do not return items so I did not want to send it back.
3,Twilight fan,This is a great story however I was disappointed in the DVD copy that there were not any special features included. I didn't realize that the price I paid for the movie would reflect what was included. I am not sure if I will purchase again just for the extras.
3,Can I call a do-over?,"Blood and Sunlight: A Maryland Vampire StoryHaving read the book and then watched the movie, it was almost painful to see just how much was taken out- all of the budding relationship between Bella and Edward was glossed over in favor of panoramic and action shots. In my opinion, it robbed the best of four books what good have been an amazing adaption. They seemed to have gotten it right by two and three so four should be interesting.If you watch this cold, you'll probably wonder what all the fuss is about. If you've read the book, you'll be able to fill in the gaps. It's a fun watch but I think it could have been a lot more."
1,SEE BELOW!,Not sure about the product...HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT YET.....AFTER MANY ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT YOU AND THE SELLER!!!!
1,Weak novel = weaker movie.,"So awful! The makeup is so sad. Poor Robert Pattinson looks like the Avon lady. Nikki Reed looks like one of the men from ""White Chicks"" and the other Cullen's are sporting dime-store wigs.The story is flimsy and constructed to setup scenes where sexual tension rules.I don't get the hype???????????????"
5,finally got the series,"I have been resisting getting this series, but now that I have watched two of the films, I guess I am now an addict to this movie series."
1,Never received merchandise,"I am very dissatisfied since I never received the merchandise. I already sent three emails to Movies Galore, and never even got an answer. My card was charged more then a month ago, and besides sending emails, I don't know how to contact Movies Galore.Regina Ferri."
1,I wish I could give a 1/2 star....,"Twilight - THE BOOK - was great. Well written, developed characters and relationships, great plot and cute story. Couldn't put it down. Bought the movie and was expecting a great flick. I was SO disappointed. The movie was awful. The way the movie was put together, the acting, the character development, the way the plot unfolded.....all AWFUL. And they omitted some really important parts of the book/plot in order to save time and added some things to make the movie ""younger"", but in doing so, made the movie choppy and weird. If you must see it, wait until it costs $5 or less....or you can have mine as I will not watch it again. Ever."
2,What a disappointment - Twilight,"The movie did NOT live up to the hype. All actors with the exception of the villains and Bella were miss cast terribly, the acting in general was terrible, the movie missed the opportunity to show off Edwards's mind reading ability big time, make up was not consistent for the vampires.Go for the special effects & villains, both are decent. Although they missed the boat on the running scenes, it's totally cheezy!"
5,Loved it!,"I love all the books, and I love the movie. It was one of the best teen love stories in along time! Can't wait for the DVD"
3,Books are always better....,"If you're a true Twilight fan, how can you not want this movie? Of course the book was/is better but it's still decent enough. For me, it was a little like watching a high school play where the cast was taking lines directly from the book while adding their own lines as well. Almost trying too hard. But I'm still a loyal fan and there's no way I won't own this DVD."
1,Sparkling ... Horrable movie my eyes burn,So I say Twilight the movie or part of it the dialog was horrible. The actors were so bad my friends all told me to see this movie because I am a huge underworld fan WRONG this is nothing like underworld not even close. When the point came in the movie where he starts to sparkle I basically just started laughing I couldn't stop laughing vampires that sparkle that's just gay(No offense to anyone). This movie IS SOOOOO BAD AND ITS STUPID as well don't waste your time on this if you want a good movie go see underworld.
1,missing somthing,This set is missing one critical item.....A gun so i can shoot myself. What a complete waste of money!Wish i could give it 0 stars.
1,Horrible acting and execution of an equally awful book.,"So many flaws with this movie; the awful acting of Kristen Stewart (Bella) just made me cringe. She portrayed absolutely NO EMOTION in this movie, or even tried to. Robert Pattinson (Edward) was equally horrible with his stoic acting and stalker attributes. I'm not too disappointed since the book was just as awful, but it would have been a nice change if they at least tried to make the movie watchable; which it was not."
3,Not sure I get the point,"I'm about as far from the demographic for this as can be, but decided I'd give the series a try to see what all the fuss is about. An angsty teen romance with the added excitement of grisly death and mayhem; its definitely watchable. But to what end? I didn't have any vampires or werewolves around at that point in my life, at least none that I knew of. But it was still a period I'd just as soon leave behind me. Maybe if you're at that point in your life there's an element of'well, I'm a social outcast, sexually confused, and unable to sustain a relationship, but at least I'm not being attacked by vampires"" that makes it compelling. Go figure. But that's what makes horseraces, I guess.We've got the second queued up for tonight, and will probably make it through all four. Maybe by then I'll understand what the point is."
5,I love it!,Was brand new when I got it in the mail and I've watched it about 30 times already. No problems at all with the disc. Thanks so much.
2,Just checking this out,"Uninspired writing and flat performancesmade me wonder why the hell this is such a hit. The only remotely interesting things in the movie are the baseball game, the werewolf kid (who doesn't even have an interesting role yet) and ""Flightless Bird"" playing at the end."
2,Unhappy with response from seller extremely rude,It was an error on my part to the ordering Thought it was the 3 movies Seller was extremely rude telling me I didn't purchase from Wal Mart charged me a fee of 25% to return....
5,twlight fan,"I read all four books in a week, then saw the movie, I then read the books again, and had to see the movie again after starting book four for the second time. Great movie, considering the length of the books the movie covered the material fairly well. I will definately order this one. The books were geared to a YA audience--and the movie is as well, but I am 41 and totally a fan. Worth getting."
2,It's as bad as they say,"I've heard nothing but bad things about this movie and everyone was pretty much right. But I gave the movie a chance anyway. It wasn't a terrible movie. It just seemed incredibly cheap and ""made for TV"" material. The movie suffers from a terrible director, screen writer, and a few bad actors. The special effects were also ultra cheap looking. The plot is generic, but it could be a good movie with the right people making it. Hopefully the next one will have more money put into it and they will get rid of all the bums that made this movie so bad."
5,Twilight Review,This movie is great. I really enjoy watching it over and over again. The DVD came in a very timely manner.
3,Half DVD,"I lent 2 disc DVD from the library to watch special features. But it was disappointing to see no closed captioning or I should say, no subtitles on it. I don't get it why Summit Company didn't add CC or subtitles on special features. In case you wonder, I am deaf. Anyway, Twilight itself is good beside extend scenes and bonus. So I gave it three stars, due to no CC on special features."
5,Twilight series,My daughter loved and read the entire series. It is increasing her reading level and enjoyment of reading.
5,Twilight,"This is a great movie to watch, and it may even encourage you to read the Twilight saga. This film is entertaining to watch no matter what age you are, and it's nice to find a romantic movie that is actually ""clean"". The DVD was in great condition when I received it. I am very pleased with it and will continue ordering from Amazon in the future."
3,Not as good if you've read the books,"Although the DVD of Twilight is good, a true Twilight fan would say the book was better. First of all, they cut out good scenes to make room for really weird ones. I was also unhappy about some of the castings, such as Esme, Charlie and Jasper. Also, Emmett, although hot, was not as big as the book had described him to be.In spite of all of this, it had to be hard to make a movie from such an amazing book and I, like many other fans, own the DVD and enjoy watching it."
3,Shipping....,"Shipping on this item, well it just SUCKS! I pre-ordered it, shipping March 18th, never got here, got lost in Michigan or something like that. Call amazon to let them know, they send me another one, STILL isn't here! That was almost 2 weeks ago!! The movie itself is good, now only if I could get it so that I could watch it!! Shipping sucks and I'm devastated that it is taking amazon forever to send me my item. They have never been this bad with shipping. :("
2,WASN'T IMPRESSED,You know I read the book before I watched the movie and I thought it was serously lacking. The book Stepnenie wrote has so much more detail. And the makeup they put on Pattinson hilarious!!!
5,"The DVD is in good condition, my wife is happy","We received the DVD on time, I was worried because it was an used DVD, but it was in good condition like new, my wife is really happy she is fan of the movie and she just wanted to have it at home, if you want to by the video, this is a good provider and you don't have to pay more since it is in great condition."
3,Twilight,"If I hadn't read the book, I don't think I would have known what was going on in the movie. They tried to cram too much in."
3,Twilight,"Of course, the movie is not even close to being as good as the book. In my opinion, they kind of just slapped it together in most parts (not the highest budget). Several parts were great tho. Kristen is the perfect pick for Bella. They made Robert look kind of dorky as Edward most of the time. His hunkiness does show thru at times tho. I think the best extra is the commentary with Rob, Kristen and the Director making comments thruout the whole movie. The other extras are interesting also. I gave it a 3 cause the movie was kind of cheesy but extremely additive. I never ever want to go thru that insanity again!!!!!!!"
1,mis-leading seller's advertisement,Thought i was buying a three-disc movies and turned out to be a rip off - it was one movie and 2 disc of behind the scenes footage i did not want - very disapointed with this purchase - beware of this sellers advertisement - x-mas morning biggest disapointment - bad -
1,Twilight,"WHAT THE %&##!!! I pre-ordered the movie months in advance and was totally excied about being able to see this before I actually received it in the mail. I was charged the rental fee and keep getting an error message when I try to play the movie. Then when I try to notify, I get the message that ya'll will contact me in 12 hours, the rental will be gone by then and I will still be charged to it. I used the code that was provided, it just sent me to the download of Unbox. Again, what the %&##! I knew I should have went to Wal-Mart!!!! Then I would be at home watching this movie. I gave one star because I had to."
1,Download a no go,"I used the Video on Demand with my Tivo and ended up with nothing. To make matters worse when I tried to get it to download a second time since the first didn't work I was charged for my 'free' day of release download. Basically, Amazon needs to figure out this problem quick because next time I want a movie on release day I'll just drive to Wal-mart or Target."
1,NOT VERY HAPPY FOR A FIRST TIME WITH AMAZON,I love the movie but very dissapointed with the promised free movie download. Been counting down the days and was greatly let down. I guess I wasn't the only one with a bad code.
1,UPSET,I am a little upset that my promotion code didn't work. I was looking forward to just sitting back and watching it this afternoon. Looks like other ppl had the same problem...can we get this fixed?
2,Pretty bad movie,I'm glad I read the book before seeing this movie. It did not do justice to impression I had of Bella and Edward. They were too stiff in this movie.
4,Nothing like Romance between a Vampire and a girl,I Thought this Movie was absolutely amazing I really enjoyed this movie and I'd recommend this movie to anyone that's a fan of the books I'm currently reading Twilight but to be honest the movie is better than the book my favorite Character in the movie was Edward Cullen and I was very surprised that Edward introduced himself to Bella Swan because I didn't think Edward was going to say Hello to Bella Swan at all I had an excellent experience with this movie and I'd Totally Recommend this movie to people.
1,avoid this tween drivel,"Basically if you have a penis or are a girl over the age of 12 avoid this movie at all costs...it will be 2 hrs of your life you'll NEVER get back. I walked out on this movie at the theater after an hour and a half as I just couldn't take it anymore. Any purchase of this DVD is a complete waste. Horrible, horrible movie...you'll have more fun watching grass grow. I've been to 100's of movies and I own over 500 DVDs, and this is the ONLY movie I ever walked out on...If I could give it negative stars I would. My rating is NEGATIVE 5 STARS"
5,An Instant Classic!,"I think the film does well to accommodate the feel of the novel. Beautiful cinematography, a great story line, and decent actors round out the film. It is a movie that one can enjoy over and over again. =)"
2,Twilight,I personally thought this was a boring movie. It didnt look interesting to me but my husband really liked it so I gave it a chance. Although I have to give this movie credit cause it did have good special effects and stunts.
2,Big fan ?,"I don't know what time my wife being a crazy fan of a movie. She bought the DVD, bluray, books all sort of things. To me, mm.. I have no such feeling with it. Anyway I hope she will not watch the movie everyday !!"
4,Twilight,"I pre-ordered the Twilight dbl disc set, and got it a day before the release date. What a fun movie to watch, I highly recommend it. How excited we were to watch it before everyone else! Also, Amazon.com stands good on their promise that if the price drops, they will pass the savings on to you."
3,Better than I thought it would be,"All the hype and teeny-bopper support convinced me that this movie would really suck. I watched it not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. I like vampire stories, especially Anne Rice's version, but I thought Twilight did bring a fresh twist to the vampire genre.I would have rated this movie three-and-a-half stars if that were an option, four is too high. I'm looking forward to the next movie in the series and hope it expands further on the tale.I'm not interested in reading the books. I have plenty to read!"
3,"Original, unique story, but not as great as the hype...","This is kind of a cool story, a girl falling in love with a vampire, who has to resist his vampiric tendencies in favor of his human-like feelings for the girl. Kind of a unique twist on the current trend of good girls being attracted to ""bad"" boys. What makes it even more of a twist is that the vampire is actually a ""good"" vampire. The way the story evolves, though, ends up rather predictably, with a SHOWDOWN between the good guy and the bad guy. zzzzzzz. Same ol, same ol' for that scene, but other than that, an interesting movie. The only two questions I have is 1. What the heck are vampires doing playing BASEBALL?? That came out of left field (pun intended). Corny! And 2. Why can't Edward read Bella's mind? That fact was never explained in the story, from what I detected.So, not an astoundingly great movie, but enjoyable....maybe the book is better."
3,Young acting but a good story,"The first of the Twilight series was a good place to start. The acting and the direction could only go up. Casting director did a wonderful job and created a phenom. If you like this one, keep going in the series. The acting gets better with each movie in most cases."
1,Could I have been ruined by Anne Rice? No I don't think so!,"I was forced to watch this movie at the behest of my wife and sister in law. I went into it with an open mind. I mean it couldn't be worse than the Frankenstein's monster that was ""Queen of the Damned"", right? Well, I can honestly say that there is a new bottom dweller in the realm of vampire movies and it is ""Twilight"". Maybe I'm out of touch, maybe I'm too old for the subject matter or maybe it's just a really bad episode of ""The OC""-with vampires. I'm going with the latter. I've heard the books are great. God, I hope so...cause if this steaming pile was taken directly from the book then I don't know. I just don't know. Pick up a ""Vampire Chronicle""...it's infinitely better."
2,shame on amazon!,"I was so excited to see that the Twilight movies were on amazon to rent for 0.99. So I planned to watch all the movies before I went to see the new breaking dawn in theaters. I rented the first movie and by the time I finished it, the new breaking dawn show had finished its first show in theaters, amazon raised video streaming from 0.99 to 2.99 on the same twilight movie I just rented. Needless to say New Moon, Eclispe,and Breaking Dawn part 1 went up as well, only Breaking Dawn went up to 3.99. Shame on you Amazon! I will not be renting the rest for that price! I rated this a 2 only because the streaming quality was great and of course its a great movie."
1,DONT BUY THROUGH AMAZON INSTANT,"TwilightI bought this through amazon as an instant download, or so I thought. The terms and conditions were completely unclear, using statements like maybe, some do some don't, in regards to a specific video being a download or stream only, but I couldn't find anywhere whether this movie was or not. So I tried it just to try it and what it is is you have the movie forever, but you can only watch it through the video player here on Amazon, and the quality sucks. The sound was so quiet I couldn't hear anything from a normal viewing distance. I could have gotten this movie for cheaper at a better quality from somewhere else. Just buy the physical disk."
1,Is this a joke?,This movie is ridiculously horrid and absolutely unrealistic. The main actors/actresses can not act. This is not what vampires are.
1,Devoid of life,"It's hard to know who to blame for this mess. Stephenie Meyers for creating an entirely unoriginal story which insults the intelligence of literate people, or Hollywood for taking it and making a film so more people can hate it. I'm tired of the constant stream of hack writers trying to reinterpret vampire mythology and repackage it so teenagers can feel hip. If you're going to prostitute yourself, at least write something original. A vampire in high school...really? Arent classes held during the day during which vampires sleep? Oh...that's right, not THESE vampires. Apparently they're not only able to go about their business on cloudy days, they're compelled to repeat their senior year in high school over 400 times. Stay away from this trash."
1,NO VAMPIRE ONLY THE NAME!,Short & Sweet! I really don't like giving reviews and don't like my real name but I had to. I watched the movie and this is NOT A VAMPIRE at all but only the name that's it. If you like Smallville buy the series instead Twilight. PS: I do like Kristen Stewart though....
3,"Didn't live up to the book, but hey..it's still TWILIGHT!","I loved the books. I knew the movie couldn't totally live up to the book. They never do. Some pivotal scenes were cut out (the meadow scene was lame, cooking for Charlie, blood typing). Some of the acting was just bad (When Edward first smells Bella in class & when Kristin over acts in the hospital). The special effects were non-existant. But I still like the casting. The scenery was amazing. I'm hoping with a bigger budget that New Moon is better. All that said, if you are a fan of the books, you will still enjoy the movie."
5,MISTERIOUS & HANDSOME EDWARD,"TWILIGHT IS THE BEST ROMANCE MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. I CAN WATCH IT OVER AND OVER ALL DAY LONG. I LIKE HOW EDWARD HAS TO MAKE A BIG EFFORT NOT TO DRINK BELLA'S BLOOD, I LOVE THE BEUTY OF HOW LOVE IS STRONGER THAN HIS THIRST. IS MISTERIOUS AND ROMANTIC NOT TO MENTION HOW HANDSOME & DELIOUS EDWARD IS. I WISH I WAS BELLA.MARY E. CERVANTES"
4,Nothing like a Vampire Love Story,"The Twilight phenomena is widespread, and no doubt helped along by this movie. The first movie, based on the first book, tries really hard to closely follow the book, which has mixed results. As a person who has read the books a few times, I love this movie and relish in the fact that I get to see the character come to life. However, even when I first saw the movie and hadn't read the book, it was still a worthwhile movie. If you don't mind the movie being a little slow, and focusing on story instead of comedy or action, then you will enjoy it. If big fight scenes or cute little actors bumbling about is your thing, then this movie may not be for you."
5,"VERY, VERY PLEASED is an under statement!!!","I very rarely buy anything from Amizon. To be honest, I only do because my brother sends me a gift card every year for Christmas. I have been wanting the ""Twilight Saga"" for some time now. I found it from this seller brand new and dirt cheap. All 3 movies came together in it's original packaging and arrived before I was even expecting them. I will deffinatley purchase from this seller again!!!"
3,"Love Twilight, disappointed in this box set","I love Twilight, and i have to admit i was disappointed in this set. the box is made of cardboard, the watch is very cheaply made too. the ""mirror"" in the box is like a silver sticker looking thing. You cant really even see yourself. It was just cheap but with an expensive pricetag. I love the bluray and cd, pictures are ok. the rst was cheap and should have cost less."
5,Romeo & Juliet of 2010,"I had read all four of Stephen Meyers books in the Twlight series and the movie I had seen and I had to own it, I already have watched it at least 15 times. I Love it!!!!!"
1,Garbage,After hearing all the good and bad reviews about twilight I decided to buy the dvd instead of reading the books. Man this movie is horrble. The fight scenes are lame the acting is off and Bella is boring as a bat. A waste of good money spent on garbage. The people giving these reviews have to be off or are just die hard fans who just want to rate the movie high because they loved the books. And what was up with the staring contest Bella and Edward were giving eachother. And Edward was on some stalker s***. I mean he was everywhere Bella was and seemed to get mad when she spoke to other people. And what was up w/ the apple trick? The action scenes were sped up so u couldn't get a look in. And did anyone notice Edward was what over 100 yrs of age and was in love w/ a 17 yr old. The twilight fans can have this junk.
1,A Massive Hate-Crime Against Cinema,"Out of all the bad movies I've ever seen (in any genre), this confusing hybrid of teen/romance/vampire/fantasy is probably the absolute worst in a very long time. It's got narrative holes the size of Mount St. Helens, YouTube quality visual effects, ugly camera-work, a jarring tone, pacing that's slower than a snail, derivative action and romance sequences, and worst of all, comical performances. Robert Pattinson has single-handedly beaten John Travolta (of ""Battlefield Earth"") for the greatest comedy performance of all time, and that is not an overstatement. Kristen Stewart's performance is also hilarious because of her expressionless face. If the 2005 book was pure garbage, then this film is a massive hate-crime against cinema. When all is said and done, ""Twilight"" makes a ridiculous premise look and sound so much worse than it does on paper. And let's face it: the sequels aren't much of an improvement if you ask me."
4,What's the fuss?,"I had no intention of watching any of the Twilight movies, but a co-worker loaned it to me and I watched. It's a good story, and Robert Pattinson didn't disappoint. Kristen Stewart, who first impressed me in ""Panic Room"", has not realized her potential. She overacts mercilessly. The weak link.The filmmakers' efforts to realize this pop-culture phenomenon are to be commended; fine production values throughout. Pattinson is really good, belying his stiff and uncomfortable appearances on talk shows, etc. I expected more from Stewart. She showed such potential in Fincher's film.With 1000 Amazon reviewers posting, this will never be read, but I felt compelled to add my humble opinion. This first of the series was actually quite smart, and well presented."
4,a must see,"The movie is great and kept close to the original story. The actors & actresses did a fantastic job portraying their characters. However, I don't think it'd be as good if you don't read the book first. They kind of went from barely talking to being in love almost instantaneously and it left going ""huh?"""
3,It's o.k,"The movie cuts out all the important Vampire things before you know he's a vampire. If you read the book you know what I mean. I was hoping it would be a mix of thrill and romance. But they skipped all the ""awe"" worthiy romance and went alomost right into the thrilling action scenes. If you've read the book and your favorite part is the romance, then see the movie but don't expect much. If you haven't read the book, see the movie then read all the books. The book has more detail that is vital for the next books in the series."
1,"Boring, Horrible movie",This is like watching a bad made for TV movie. The acting leaves a lot to be desired. Terrible.
1,A total puzzle,"Why people bought thousands of copies of the book? -- Hype.Why someone made a movie based on it? -- A total puzzle.There have been so many classic vampire movies starring world known actors. This one is a repeat, which just a few twists attempting to make it different (and they don't succeed, for the most part). Choosing unknown young actors is a plus, but it doesn't offset the repetitiveness of the subject."
3,Great disappointment compared to the book,"I had a hard time watching this movie after having read all 4 books. I found myself critiquing each scene in the movie rather than enjoying the visual. Many scenes were almost cut and pasted from the book, some changes, and then some scenes were taken and compacted. I realize that the movie couldn't be an exact replica of the novel, but at the same time, I think they could have done a better job. I was disappointed in some of the casting as well as the simplicity of the plot. I would recommend the movie only if you haven't read the book first."
4,Better a second time around...,"This movie was pretty decent. I do agree that if you read the books it seems pretty bad, I wanted to actually walk out at a few points. But after watching this again on blu-ray and knowing what to expect, it was very good. I am impressed overall even though certain things were left out of the story."
3,WHYS IT GOTTA BE SO DIFFICULT!!!,"I got the code, and my daughter was able to watch it, but not before I had allkinds of trouble downloading it., and I just tried to download a corey smith song, and it's lost in cyber space somewhere too. THIS SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,A rare case in which the movie is better than the book,"I didn't particularly like this movie, but it was by far better than the book.The book was overly verbose, extremely boring, and difficult to get through. The movie, while also too long and boring at times, cut out a lot of Bella's excruciating, ""OMG Edward is so hot!!"" rants and excessive description.This may be the first time I've ever preferred a book to a movie. Although, in this case, that isn't saying much since I loathed the book."
1,MyGod,"My God, I cannot believe this was made into a movie. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, it was pure agony sitting through this. Please do not watch this movie."
1,Waste of 2 hours,"Terrible movie! I am not sure whether it is the fault of the actors or director. There is no passion, no character development, and no chemistry between Bella and Edward. This could have been SO much better. Unfortunately, either bad acting or horrible directing got in the way."
5,Exciting New Movie,"This is a thrilling, and energetic new movie that had me glued to the screen. If you like vampire movies or novel's you will love this movie. My only problem was when the movie was over I wanted to watch it again. I suggest this movie for all vampire lovers out there."
4,Great movie,"This was a very entertaining flick; I wouldn't say it's as good as the book, but it definitely gives you your money's worth. For a two hour film, it stays as close to the book as a film version possibly can. Keep in mind that films based on books are 'condensed', as you can't fit a 600 page book into 120 minutes of movie! But I can say with confidence that you'll be pleased with the film. There's a lot of action, a lot of romance, suspence, etc! Looking forward to New Moon this winter!"
2,great... if you just want 2 watch it,"I bought this copy of the movie, because it was the least expensive DVD. when i got it in the mail i realized why, the only thing on the DVD is the movieno special features, and only a couple previews.A few months after I bought it I stopped liking twilight so now this DVD along with the other twilight movies sit in a drawer in my room that i fill with stuff I don`t want"
3,Depends,Well I love the books they are about a thousand times better than the movies. Sadly the movies leave a lot out and the acting I do honestly believe bugs bunny could do a better job. So in short I do recommend the books but the movies are best left for a laugh.
1,creepy,"ok, i knew it was for kids, but i was curious... if i think of something good about this film, i'll change my comment."
1,Don't waste your money,"After reading all the Twilight books, I was extremely disappointed. In my opinion, they did not do the book justice. The film felt choppy and there was no chemistry between Edward and Bella's characters. Save your money and read the book again instead."
1,Vampire Borefest,"After reading the first chapter of this book, I was amazed at how lame and colorless it was. It didn't have the poetry of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and lacked potent imagery. Dull, dishwater dreariness! I rented only out of curiosity of it's box office draw. It was so low budget, with so many unseasoned actors and a very week (almost laughable)script for it's paper thin plot. A bad vampire movie usually turns out to be a gore fest with little to no romance. This movie is certainly not belonging to the horror genre and the chemistry between the lackluster performances of the principle actor's was non-existent. It was more of a bore fest! I could only imagine the appeal of this movie coming from a wide teenage virgin audience (which appears to be larger than I imagined). Thank you for wasting two hours of my life on this B-movie joke! B for boring!"
1,Laughably Bad Movie,"I had to see what all the Twilight fuss was about. I read all 4 books and although obviously written toward a teenage girl level, the books were amusing and mildly interesting. But the movie was amateurish, poorly acted and a big bore. The quality of writing, casting, filming, sound, editing and directing were all outrageously bad. I don't get it at all and will skip the sequels."
5,Love it even though I think it's corny!,"So, I absolutely loved all four books. I even drug my now ex-boyfriend to see the movie with me in theaters. The lines that I loved from the book seemed corny and over acted in the movie, but I still love it and can't wait to see New Moon on the big screen.As for those of you who complained, sorry, my code worked just fine and I watched it the same night I ordered it. Stinks for you! lol"
3,"okay, but could of been better","Very hard to follow, helps to read the book first. And not real impressed with the acting, but did enjoy watching for the most part."
1,Not impressed,"I, like many others it seems, was initially excited that, although Amazon was not shipping my pre-ordered copy of Twilight on the release date (though I seem to recall having received my pre-ordered copies of Harry Potter on Saturdays in the past), they were offering us the chance to download it for free to watch it today. I chose to download it to my PC because watching online is never seamless, constantly skipping and buffering. But right now it's estimating 8 hours for the download! Absolutely ridiculous! Next time I'll buy elsewhere to avoid the extreme disappointment Amazon has given me over a movie I was so excited about. Blockbuster, anyone?"
1,Dropped the ball,"When I contacted amazon (by phone, the email contact us link would not go through - same message as the promotional code link - Navigation Canceled) I asked if other people were having problems. ""Nope, its just your computer settings and we can't help you with that"" Really?? Looks like I wasn't the only one after all now was I??"
3,It gets better.,"This first movie is kinda corny, but it gets better as the series progresses. If you stick through it, it gets to be worth it. :)"
5,movie,Was glad to get this movie as I now have all the Twilight movies and waiting for the last one to come out.
1,Worse move Ever!!,"Yep,People will suck up anything and call it great! No it is not and to say SM is the next J.K is a joke an insult to J.K herselfA morbid bent woman's wet dream put to film and paper, is this world so starved that they will take mediocre story and say it is greatness"
1,twilight,If I was a teenager I might at least have made it through the whole film. Unfortunatly or fortunatly I am not I found it boring and nonsensical to say the least. Come on a vampire love affair. Anyway I'm sure that there are people out there who love this film and I say great this is just one persons view. Awful
2,Disappointed,"I absolutely loved Twilight and have read the book several times. However, I was very disappointed about the movie. I understand it's an adaptation of the book, but I felt the movie barely touched on Edward & Bella's relationship. I was so enamored with their relationship and how they fell more and more in love in the book. I felt the movie focused more on the action and the love story kind of fell through the cracks. I also hated how some of the scenes from the book were changed in the movie."
2,MISLEADING,"The advertizement read Three Disc Set, which leads one to believe that it would be all 3 movies in the series so far, but it was one movie and two disc about the movie that will more than likely never be viewed. I know it is up to me to read the advertizement thoroughly, but anyone would have to agree that the ad is Misleading."
2,zzzzzzzzzz,"Teenager moves to a small town to live with clueless, single father and courts brooding, dangerous boyfriends of dubious ancestry from rival gangs. Trouble ensues. A melodrama in three increasingly tedious parts. (North)West Side Story without the tunes."
5,Twilight,"I just love it....the effects, the story, the acting ....all great. I want them to make 20 more movies but all good things still end"
4,Almost great,"This movie has some good parts, bad parts, an great parts. Although it was kind of cheesy, it still makes u want to see the rest of the movies."
4,The book was better but the movie is worth watching,"I missed seeing it in the theaters, maybe hadn't finished reading the book yet (think I'd started it), but decided to go ahead and buy the 2 disc DVD based on the look of the TV ads. That isn't usually a good idea but overall I was pleased with the movie. Shot on what passes for a cheap budget these days almost nothing looks as it did in the book and several scenes are missing or reworked.I was surprised to note that while it ""looked"" different much more than usual of the dialog was adapted into the script. Maybe too much of it- when Jessica is identifying the various Cullen's for Bella she says ,"" the little one, that's Alice"", actress Ashley Greene isn't little ( as Alice Cullen is usually described in the books) but more of an average height.I wish that most of the Cullen's background detail hadn't been cut out, never to be seen, but generally found the movie to be likable. Be sure and watch the extras too."
4,Interesting twist on an old story line,"Loved it, not only was it a good twist on the vampire story lines but it was rated PG-13! What a rarity, thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie and would highly recommend to any fantasy lovers out there."
1,Will not pre order again.,"I too am very disappointed in the whole process. I could have gotten the video at Walmart for less and on the day it was released. The ""consolation"" gift from Amazon of a free viewing of the film is a joke. It has taken four hours to completely down load the proper program which allows me to view the ""free rental"" on my computer. And I have been downloading the rental for over 3 hours and am only at 8%. All with a high speed wireless Broadband. This is rediculous."
2,Movie is great! Amazon 24 hour download is a waste!,"I love this movie so I would give it a 5...I was blown away with the customer service at first for allowing customers who pre-ordered the movie to watch it free for 24 hours until our DVD got to us...I tried to use my code today and was annoyed when my computer froze up and had to reboot and came back to amazon thinking I could watch the movie for 24 hours and couldn't find the movie anywhere to watch...I contacted customer service and still haven't heard anything. From these reviews I can tell it happened to a lot of people. It just annoying when you are promised one thing and the website itself doesn't come through. AND PS: Unbox is a waste of time, it doesn't work properly!!!"
1,So Disappointed :(,"I've really enjoyed the books (like everyone else!) and I was so excited to see the movie, but it was such a disappointment! It was hard to believe how bad it actually was. First of all, the actors couldn't act - there was no emotion to their parts. I didn't believe that Edward and Bella actually felt anything for each other. There was no spark and it was so robotic. It also felt rushed. Yes, movies never capture the details you get from a book, but if you try to fit everything in there is no depth. I feel like I have to go back and read the books to remember the characters the way they should be. If they are planning on making the next ones, which I hear they are, I will not be getting them."
2,Awful acting,"I didn't read the book, but since it was a hit with the teenagers and housewives around here I thought it might be a good choice for a light romance. The acting from the main female actor was terrible..very stiff and she delivered her dialogue the same. With the hype given to this movie, I expected better acting. I rated it as I did because of a couple of the scenes that were actually pretty decent. Overall, however, it stunk."
3,"Good movie, book much better","I've watched this movie a total of 3 times-one with the audio commentary. As usual, the book is much better than the movie; however, you could not have picked a better Bella and Edward. The movie was alot better the second time around, but I feel that they left alot out of the movie that should have been included. The audio commentary wasn't anything special-but it did show how down to earth Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart both are. I could have done without some of Catherine Hardwicke's cheesy comments, but she did give some nice insight into when and where everything was filmed. The entire Twilight saga is extremely addicting and after reading all of the books, I'm sure I will see all of the movies. :)"
5,Twilight,Whether it's the book or the movie - the story draws you in and you are immediately in love with a fictional character!! Great read and great film!Entertaining and fun - don't fight it - just join in the craze - it's worth it!
5,LOVE TWILLIGHT!,"Love the books and the movies even if the movies cant be exactly like the books!I really like the 2 disc special editions because they have all the commentary and they tell you why they dident put certain things in the movies. It just gives you a better perspective on the story line.So if you like the books you should deffinatly buy the 2 disc versions!Although my husband doesent like them, i dont think many Men do!"
4,"Good quality, for the most part","For the most part, this dvd was in good condition. There is a part of the movie that skips in a couple of places and the disc, the front and back of the case are written on. Other than that, it was a good purchase."
5,Really Enjoyed the Special Edition,"I just recently purchased the two disc special edition and I really enjoy watching it. I especially enjoyed the special features.The director introduced each extended scene and it was interesting to see what the scenes would have looked like before they shortened them or removed parts.The director also introduced the deleted scenes. I think some of them were pretty good too.It was nice to get a feel for the way the director worked and to see how much fun it was in making the movie.I found it fascinating to see how they made the book into a fabulous movie working with the author.Twilight is definitely a hit with me. I guess you either like it or you don't!I like it, watch it often and enjoy it every time. The two disc special edition was worth the money for me and I look forwards to more."
3,Twilight,Movie is adequate but not very detailed. Book is much more interesting. Characters not as believeable in the movie. Actors are good but seem to be to passive.
4,I would buy it again,I loved the book so I was curious about the film. The acting wasn't the best but I did enjoy the eye candy.
3,The book is a lot better.,"After i read the book i could not wait to watch the movie, but i was disapointed the movie has does not show everything that the book talks about."
3,In and of itself?,"I really and truly enjoy the movie, but I have to completely disassociate the book from the movie. As two different entities they are both quite entertaining, but comparing the movie to the book is more than irritating.Considering the budget I think they made the most of what they had...They lost something in the translation honestly... The book Twilight was all about Bella and Edward... The movie seemed to revolve around the 3 Stray Vamps who just happened to wonder into the area... The 3 vamps had a moderately big part in the book, but in the movie the entire script seems to revolve around them and not the two main characters.Twilight was suppose to be the beginning of a love story... but the movie lost the intensity of that simple fact.As I said disassociate the movie from the book... If you can do that they are both wonderfully enjoyable!"
1,All hype no follow thru,"The movie actually deserves 2 or 2.5 stars but to bring reason to this poorly produced film with choppy sequences I had to try to bring the average down. I waited till midnight to rent this video and I was very disappointed that I spent the time. Read the other reviews, mine is just 1 in 200. The book series is very good the movie has short choppy sequences I feel poorly re-enacted from the book."
3,Not bad,"As mentioned before it's not the greatest, but as a 'Twilighter' I can't help but love the movie and if I were giving stars for that I'd be giving 5. The three stars is because of the terrible special effects, so-so score and so-so direction. Given that the budget was so tiny (come on Summit, the fans deserved better than that, especially since the books were such a huge hit. You pretty much had a good guarantee that this would be a huge seller) I can't really hold Hardwicke responsible, but I feel her direction of the characters needed a bit more oomph. Pattinson gets much better as the film goes along (love him in the big fight scene) as does Stewart...I feel she overacts a little in the first half...All in all, if you want to escape for a couple of hours, then Twilight is the answer."
3,I love the books and like the movie...,"Sorry, I thought that the acting in some parts of the movie was a little over the top. 3 scenes: *Bella and Edward in the car after he saves her in Port Angeles and she says that his hands are ice cold. He really plays up the soap opera face in that one. *Whenever Bella is back in Phoenix and James contacts her and she hears her mother's voice. Her reaction is that of someone who knows that the camera is on her, but she is pretending that it isn't. *In the hospital, after Edward saves her and he tells her to move to Jacksonville to be safe from any harm that could come to her because of him. Her reaction is overacting.I love the books. The movie is okay. It could have been so much better."
1,Terribly.......gay,This movie was awful. Is this movie supposed to be a comedy? It made me laugh quite a few times.
2,Did not translate well to film,"I loved the book, but it did not seem to translate well. I was very disappointed. Charlie, Carlisle, Esme, Rosalie, Alice, and Emmett were perfect. Jasper and Edward were ridiculous. Some seriously bad acting. Robert Pattinson and the guy that played Jasper struggled with looking tortured and mostly ended up like they just had their eyes dilated at the doctor. Bella's character suffered from a little over acting as well. Lots of heavy breathing and gulping. Very awkward performances, but my hopes are high for the sequel. Hopefully, the script will be better than Twilight as well."
3,No contest to the book.,"First of all, I must say that I absolutely LOVED Twilight and grew up in the area, so this movie was hard to watch. I think ""Edward"" did a horrible job at his character, and the setting was so wrong that I was cringing the whole time. That being said, I did preorder it and watch it when I need a quick fix of Twilight when I don't have the time to read. I just imagine the rest of the storyline. It was a good movie, but I think I would have liked it better had I not read all the books first."
3,Knew I would love the movie - but special features were a disappointment,"I love the Twilight movie, but I was really hoping that the special features would show a lot of those great scenes from the book that happened to get cut. There wasn't... The deleted scenes contained one that was relevant to the story, two that were honestly kind of crossing the line to porno, and two others that weren't important enought to remember. I really think that there could have been a lot more to offer with the product. I would reccommend someone buying the special three disc Target release that comes with 45 minutes of extra footage, it was definitely more bang for your buck."
3,Warning to the book fans...,"I absolutely love the 4 books (have already read them twice and getting ready for round 3). However, the movie is a far cry from the books. I know that it would be hard to incorporate elements of the book into a 2 hour movie, but they could have done so much better. The acting was not that great and some of the music and scenes were down right embarrassing to me as I watched this with my husband (who is very patient). Way to much staring and time in trees. TREES???? Also, it was very frustrating to see lines from the book used, but in completely different scenes. To any book lover, I would suggest renting the movie before buying it. I really, really, really wanted to like this movie since I am such a fan of the story, but I just can't! Thankfully, I rented it before I bought it and wasted my money. Maybe New Moon will be better since it has a different director."
3,Collectors Box,"The biggest perk of this little package is that it comes with the soundtrack. It includes the 2-disc special edition which is an amazing DVD. The box, though pretty, is of cheap quality and is made of paper and cardboard... not for real use. The bracelet is sold at hot topic and like all jewelry at hot topic its not good quality but it is cute costume jewelry. The watch is plastic and the face is plain. The photo cards are very nice and good quality. Over all is your a Twi-Hard you will like this set but expect toy quality items. -I still like mine =)PS if you want the DVD version it is currently available at Costco."
1,Should have bought it at WalMart,"When I used the download code, It says it will be available to watch in 16 hours (and I have high speed). In 16 hours I could go out and buy the DVD from another store and be hours ahead. Won't be buying anything else from Video on Demand and maybe not from Amazon again."
1,Pointless,"What's the point of pre-ordering if I could have just walked out to the store and purchased the same DVD for the same price and ACTUALLY got to watch it that day? I never received my code, and spent over 30 minutes on the phone with Amazon to to get the code. It's not worth it and I'll remember that next time I want to buy a DVD."
2,Not a vampire movie,"I'm a fan of the show True Blood on HBO. While the first season was being aired was when I heard about Twilight. So I was all about watching a movie about humans interacting with vampires. I didn't read the books and I didn't follow what it was all about so don't knock me on that. But to say this is a vampire movie would be false... This is a teenage love story. The whole damn movie is a ""I want to be with you but I don't know how"" cliche. Nonsense after nonsense. As for the girl... she has maybe six lines in the movie when she doesn't end it with a girly exhale. Any vampire fans out there that are looking for another good flick might want to stay clear of this one."
1,They cut out the campy fun parts to this suckfest!,"When I saw Twilight in the theater I was expecting it to not be faithful and I was sort of right. The bright spots were the campy crappy parts like when Edward hisses at the drunken jocks, when Bella says, ""You're skin is so cold,"" and when Edward looked like he was going to throw up when he first saw Bella. I am glad they kept the whole, ""I'm a killer,"" sequence, but then again they really couldn't cut that out/down. The editors had to cut these sequences in order for it to be a ""serious"" tween flick, but my 2 daughters loved those parts and are now upset. I can't wait for Rifftrax to get ahold of this!"
1,doesnt work.,"at first, i thought it would be good since we didn't get the copy of twilight on the day it came out. then, i tried to watch the movie and it disappeared. so basically i don't get to see it until amazon ships it to me..which will be thursday at the latest."
3,Glad I saw the movie first,"Okay, so I saw the movie skeptically b/c I was thinking it was sort of a teenager cult type deal and was pleasantly surprised. I loved the way that it made me coo. So the next day I bought the first Twilight book and stormed through it in a day and a half. Read the other 3 1/2 just as fast. Loved almost every minute of them. So I can look at the movie a little differently now. Boy had a lot changed from the book. Characters were added and some deleted, personalities were altered, it was just strange to see the adaptation that the movie took. But, it's nice, but if I had read the book first, I am pretty sure I would have cursed through the entire thing. But of course, this is just my humble opinion."
3,Symantec Firewall blocking download,"After reading several of the comments I saw that several people were having trouble downloading the movie. So I am writing this in hopes that it will help someone else.I spent several hours trying to download the movie. Even though it claimed to have a good connection and it claimed to be downloading, it always stayed at 0.0%. I tried restarting and reconnecting everything but nothing helped, until I disabled the Symatec client firewall. Now I can see the download progressing and have hope that I will be able to watch the movie tonight afterall."
4,Editorial review of the Editorial Review - another one,"I just want to say that the person who wrote the editorial review didn't read the book very closely if she thinks there was any ambiguity in Edward's initial interest in Bella - it DEFINITELY sprang from his overpowering attraction to her scent, as she smelled DELICIOUS to him. This is less clear in the movie. Other than that, I have to say that my daughter and I swept through these easy to read and very imaginative books, and thoroughly enjoyed the movie as well. GREAT casting, too. Can't wait for movie #2. This was written by J. Ealy, Derek's wife."
1,It was better than the book,"Based on my daughter and a friend's rave reviews of the book, I suffered through reading Twilight . I have no idea why this book has become so popular.And yet, on a whim, I decided to watch the movie. HORRIBLE. It was barely than the book.Both the book and movie were a complete waste of time."
3,A little disappointed...,"I was a little disappointed that the free download (which was a nice thought) didn't include the bonus features. I mean, we've already seen the movie, we want the bonus materials! I still haven't received mine in the mail."
2,great movie great service BUT only got to see half,"Amazon is great for the pre-order price guarantee, and offering a free digital copy b/c of the delay in shipping but unfortunately, my copy weirded out after 20 min into the movie, the sound was on but no video. Don't know what happened. Guess I'll just have to wait for the dvd to get here"
5,Twilight,I really enjoyed this movie in the Theater so I had to have it. I preordered it through Amazon and got to rent it for free on amazon rentals the day it was released while it was in the mail.
5,Twi-hard.... of course I love it,"Although there are many differences between the book and movie, I still love the movie..."
5,She loved it,"My 12 year old wanted a Twight Light themed party and this was the perfect touch to the theme, plus it doubled as part of her present."
3,mmmhm,"i broke down and had to watch the series, since everyone else in the world already had. i'm 29 so if you're a teen i'm sure it's fine, but these movies somehow grab your attention and make you want to finish the story, but are cinematically pretty awful. lots of people raved about the effects and acting but actually it's pretty terrible. to be fair, taylor laudner (or whatever) is actually pretty good, he's the best one of the bunch. otherwise, snore."
2,"It's no ""Let The Right One In""","the so-so movie adaptation of the wildly selling books about vampires in high school that didn't satisfy fans of the book (though they saw the film three or four times just to make sure it wasn't that good) or those of us who found the book poorly written but thought it might make good source material for a fun movie. Still, Robert Pattinson does look awfully pale and dreamy in BluRay. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
2,Where is the full screen ??,"Loved the books, was excited to buy the DVD but why is there no full screen addition available? At least if they had to do wide screen I wish they did the one with small black bars at the top and bottom of the screen instead of wide black bars. It makes the picture half the size. It bothers me through the whole movie. Hope the next one is not like this."
1,"Bad story, terrible movie","[...]Please note the blatant line of where the ""SEXY VAMPIRE! <3"" makeup ends and his ""BORING REAL PERSON"" skin begins. Now, if I were to be investing so much money in a film about pale vampires, I would make sure that my vampires actually looked like vampires and not like...actors with too much horrible white makeup plastered onto their faces. And please, spare me the comments of ""THAT'S HIS HAIRLINE WHICH GOES ON FOR MILES HE LOOKS LIKE A REAL VAMPIRE OH MY GODZ FOR REALZ!!!1! I'M MRS. EDWARD CULLEN I SHOULD KNOW WHAT A VAMPIRE LOOKS LIKE!!!"" Actually, if someone even uses the term ""REAL vampire"", I think that may be a good enough indication of what I mean, though I digress.Needless to say, the 'Twilight' film is as lacking visually as the book which started this whole mess is in ares of plot and decent writing.Happy viewing."
1,Night of the Living Brain Dead,"A tedious, contrived, illogical, pretentious, poorly written and ineptly directed half hour TV show about socially awkward, alienated outcasts who act weirdly, drone on and on and on while saying little that's been stretched into the longest, most annoying, and boring two hour movie I've ever seen."
1,Not really a high definition movie!,"Dont have great expectations about the quallity of the movie, not a high definition movie! just Dvd quallity, save your money and buy the dvd movie."
1,dissapointed,I was excited about getting the free download. I tried entering the code at least 4 times. It didn't work! I so wanted to see it!
1,Great... (rolls eyes),I preordered a copy of the movie on the first day we could preorder it. I got an email on Thursday saying it had been shipped... and would arrive Tuesday. I thought- no big deal I can watch it using the promotional code online... Only I JUST got the email TODAY. Yeah... I went to Walmart last night and bought the darn thing at midnight. TUESDAY? Come on! I can't even get the preview of the movie to load here without skipping... so I won't bother trying to watch the whole thing now that I have the dvd. WHY can't they send them out so that we get them on RELEASE day???
1,Where is my free rental of Twilight???,I pre-ordered twilight like everyone else did and I received an email that I would receive a promotional code to watch the free rental. I did not get this email like most people did. It's very disappointing seeing that I want to see this movie so bad. I didn't catch it in theaters because I wasn't a fan of the Twilight story at first. I had just recently decided to read the Twilight book and I absolutely loved it!!! Hopefully I'll get my dvd today and not Tuesday like they estimated.
1,Twilight,"I was pleased to receive the email with a promo for free rental for my pre-order, but unhappy that the code did not work. Disappointed that I was unable to watch the film on day of release."
1,Seriously Amazon!,I pre-ordered the Twilight 2 disc dvd on the same day my friend ordered her copy. She received hers and I did not receive mine and we live in the same town. To make matters worse...or better as the case may be...I was told in an email that I would get a code to watch the movie for FREE! I Did Not get the second email with the code in it. I was horribly disappointed that I wasn't able to watch Twilight either with my own copy or the online download. After reading all the negative feedback about the codes not working I'm at least glad I didn't get one...only to not have it work! That would have been far worse!! I'm not at all impressed.
3,Still addicting seen 5 times,Never in my life have I gone to the movies to see the same movie 5 times. I even got my friend hooked. While it doesn't really stay with the book you can't expect it to but still its addicting and you just can't see it once.
5,Addition to collection,Delivery was as promised and after reading the books I wanted to have the movie for my collection. I have all of them at this time.
3,Twilight,I thought the movie started out pretty good but became so fake later on. I guess I like movies that are more realistic.
4,thank you,I love this series. I like the extras on this first movie.can't wait to get the rest of the movies.
4,Stupid Bella,Still don't like Bella but will watch the movie for Jacob and Edward alone. Just once I wished that Jacob would turn her down when she needed his help
4,"fast delivery, great movie",i got the dvd earlier that what i was supposed to and it was in very good condition for a used dvd. no problems.
2,Gah! Bring back Buffy!,"I finally caved and watched this movie to try to understand it's prominence in pop-culture.13 year old girls are entitled to neurotic fantasies--they're 13!--and this movie seems to hit every bad news, sublimated, masochistic, narcissistic beat. This movie is an understandable craze for tween girls thoroughly f****d up by puberty and culture . . . The fact that this movie has such a large 'adult' female audience is REALLY disturbing. I think even less of some of my co-workers than I did before.Me? I'm a 43 year old woman and I'll stick with Buffy reruns for my vampire entertainment, thanks just the same."
2,Fangs baby where the damn fangs?,"They're vampires right? Where are the dang fangs? Not one, did I see. And why does Edward always look like he just finished off a cherry popsicle? This movie needed more stakes thru hearts and vampire stuff. I'd suggest renting Friday the 13th instead. More blood, more guts for your buck."
1,Beh! Worst movie ever,"This movie makes little sense if you have read the book and none if you haven't. It is poorly cast, poorly filmed and poorly directed. What a complete waste of time and money."
1,Wow.,"And by ""wow"" I mean, that was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting in this movie is complete crap with Bella being portrayed as a whiny, moody [.....]the whole time. It's also ridiculous how much of the story is about Edward telling Bella that she shouldn't love him and the only reason she does is because he's a vampire and is going to kill her. And her obvious immaturity shows when she basically replies ""but I love you and I don't think you'll really kill me."" Besides the horrible acting and storyline the script was ludicrous and made me laugh out loud at inappropriate times. For example: using ""spider monkey"" as a term of endearment.Just so all of you Twilight obsessed people know, I did read the books too, (they're crap btw and will probably lead you to need a therapist if you base your future relationships on them) so I'm not just basing all of this off of the movie."
1,if I could give zero stars I would.,"The disc arrived broken. There really is no additional notes necessary. The disc was broken, it did not work, therefore it was crap."
3,If I Was Your Glampire!!!,"Recently, I read the book, so I wanted to watch the movie again. I noticed they left things out, and changed scenes. I would say the book is better because it's more detailed and a richer experience. Bella Swan moves back to Forks, Washington with her dad. She meets a glampire named Edward Cullen and falls suicidely in love with him. I'd probably recommend TWILIGHT!!!"
4,Really enjoy the movie... amazon packaging was dissappointing,"Loved the movie after renting it, so I decided to order it off amazon. Box came undamaged. Open the box, the movie was opened with no DVD inside. Called amazon, they are shipping another one, but I am still sad that I don't have my movie right now."
2,Twilight,Enjoyable and entertaining but not any where near as good as the book. My 12 year old daughter is totally entralled and obsessed with these characters.
5,Best Movie Out These DAYS!,"wow...i read a lot of bad things about this movie,so i was so close on not buying it.but i decided to give it a try,so i did and OMG i so love this movie now,i mean its great and sad (lol),now i cant stop watching the movie every day when i come from school,and the best thing is that besides the awsome movie it includes awsome special futures and some cool music videos including Super Massive Black Hole from Muse.(this song was in the most cool scene in the movie which was the baseball scene [ilove that scene]).but yea;buy this movie its great and i bet you will be happy whit this movieand the price its goood too $17.99(trust me you wont regret it!);)"
5,Awesome,This was an awesome movie. It's not too chick flicky or too action packed. It followed the book pretty well. Some parts were different from the book but I think it made sense to produce the film that way.
3,None,"I absolutely love the twilight series as books. The movie did not follow the book on many things. The acting was awkward at times....but if you take the movie as it is ""just a movie"" then it is very entertaining. I just wished it had followed the book more."
5,An Excellent Guide,"I bought this book here after seeing it reviewed on Williams-Sonoma's website. It really is an excellent guide to mixology. I foudn the guides to different liqours at the beginning of the book very interesting - I now know the difference between Bourbon, scotch, and whiskey, what a sour mash is, and the difference between ""gin"" and ""London Dry gin"". This is probably the only cocktail reference one needs to have on hand. Great book."
5,A great guide for any Mixologist!,"Well this was a real find. As the author of ""[...]"" I found this to be an amazing resource. I come from the weigh loss industry and consider myself a Skinny Mixologist, not a Master Mixolgist by any right. Understanding the history behind true craft cocktails gave me insight and confidence I need to continue to fine tune my craft. It's always such a fun challenge to look at 500 recipes and find creative solutions to lowering sugar and calorie content, while still preserving the integrity of the cocktail. I'm very appreciative for Degroff's expertise in the subject and would recommend it to anybody looking to improve cocktail savvy. Understanding the history is the only way we can truly appreciate the inevitable evolution of the industry. Cheers!"
5,Kraft of the Cocktail,"Yes, I know craft is spelled with a C, but a friendly and adorable neighborhood bartender is the one who introduced me and a friend to the book. When I read the cocktail napkin later in the evening, I noticed he spelled craft with a K. It just stuck.A month later this same friend and I purchased it for each other and could not have been happier with the book. We use it as a reference book and to create fun drinks around party themes. It has recipes for drinks many other books do not include. The historical notes and stories make it a pleasure to read.If you would like to make a good drink and don't have time to attend a class, or just want some support once you are at home, this is a fantastic book to have in your library."
3,SteReO TyPiKaL ... TYpiKaLLY,"this book was good in many ways , but at he same time it makes it seem like mainly the african american young ladys , or young ladys in th ghetto are the ones *accidentally* getting knocked up and becoming pregnate . Allthough the author may be black , it still makes it seem that girls of minoritys dont have respect for there selves or that they are loose. Besides the point of the stereo typical theory , the book is good and at the same time it gives many young girls and women encouragment to not let little & big things get in there way and to keep on pushin' on. So the book has its up's and downs and highs and lows . ReAd It FOr YoUr SeLf AnD seE wHaT yoU ThInK! good luck"
3,Coming out of the ghetto,"""Spellbound"" is a book that I had to read in a lit circle at school. Spellbound tells about a Black girl named Raven that lives in a New York slum. Raven is seventeen and was forced to drop out of school because she had a baby. She got pregnant from a boy that she met at a ""make-out"" party and didn't even know his name. She spent most of her days at home with her best friend Aisha. Aisha also had a child and was a dropout. Raven's older sister entered her in a spelling bee (her worst subject) to earn a college scholarship if she wins. Raven thinks it's a great idea, but doesn't know how to spell well. Raven studied very hard and won the spelling bee. The ending was predictable, but it was still a good book."
1,"Pretty, but a disappointment","I bought this watch about a year ago and it has since died. I love skeleton watches, and initially this watch seemed perfect. However if I relied on the automatic self-winding it lost minutes a day. Eventually I took to winding it, but it continued to be off regularly. Now it doesn't keep time at all. I am digging up the warranty..."
5,Great Product...!!!,"Am very happy with the product, only con would be that you need to wind it everyday but as long as you get used to it, its great..!!!"
5,An album you just gotta hear!,"Masahiko Togashi - Guild For Human Music (1976)If you are looking for an album that will transcend you into another dimension then you have come to the right place. This is the progressive-exploratory side of jazz and trips right over fusion.....smack dab!This album is not for the faint-of-heart! It is a study in both sound and textures with some crazy percussion throughout.""Guild For Human Muisc"" is composed of 6 ""expressions"" which is a very good choice of words to depict there songs. Togashi blends his vast array of percussion with various woodwinds, keyboards, flutes and bass effects creating a very lunaristic - transcedental'ish album that verges on extraterrestrial!.......in other words this is far out stuff....The end result is an album that really works considering how ""lunaristic"" it is.......The sound quality is also outstanding and is pure audiophile territory!"
5,Sumptuous tomes of exhiliarating opulence and normality.,Perfect production. It's not often you see everyday(?) items so beautifully reproduced.I drooled over exquisite legacies and fantasised about bidding in the auction. As an historical record of the lives of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor it's impeccable. As far as we are allowed to see.
4,How they soon forget (good music),"Much like the 70's there was far to much talent in the 90's for every artist of the time, to have recieved proper recognition. And Mona Lisa is sadly one of those soon forgotten artist of a wonderful era of music, I had forgotten all about this girl myself, till I started recollecting & searching for earlier music that I once owned, and soon realized I needed to rebuy this album and quick. So I ordered a copy from Amazon. Her voice is very beautiful and she hits every note with care, at no point is her voice over-bearing. This is an incredible album, and if you can find a copy for a good price buy it, because this album is out of print, and is not currently available as an mp3 download yetThis debute album is great and to think her second album to date, still remains unreleased :("
5,Mona Is Making a Comeback,"I am a friend of Mona's and if you look for her profile on Myspace under ""The Original Mona Lisa"" you will hear some of her new songs on her profile. She is working on a new album and I have heard 12 of the tracks and can say her comeback will be amazing..."
5,"Still a Big Fan , Mona lisa","This albums is the greatest I've heard in a while, I wish she was still out she was an great artist, She had an, second album that never came out called peach, with Island Records, than a third album with Defsoul, Called Gettin it on but neither never came out, I was waiting for their release.Gettin it on is on the woo soundtrack though it's tight.Hope she comes back on day."
4,Where is Mona Lisa?,"I believe I first heard Mona Lisa on Lost Boyz hit single ""Renee (remix)""---her vocals really complimented that song. She was also singing on their single ""Music Makes Me High"". Then, when her single ""Can't Be Wasting My Time"" featuring Mr. Cheeks came out, I fell in love with it. This is a good album so go cop that disc."
5,My favorite book EVER!,"I had a friend give me this book to read when I was 13 and read it atleast 5 times before I gave it back to him. I asked him years later when he was home on a visit from the navy and he said sorry man my mom thru all my old books away. Can you believe that?? Anyway, I finally have found it again at age 32 and let me tell its even better then I thought! I was concerned maybe I outgrew it or something but no way as Gary Gygax is an absolute genius and it shows most I think in his books. I also want to point out there are several more books to this series all of which are great."
3,bands becoming a polished poor imitation of a former self,"To those with the taste for sugar coated over produced songs about breakups this cd is for you. The best cd's of alkaline trio have passed by the wayside, and as with every other band it is time to spew out music made to make an appearance on mtv. If you were looking for stunning hits liek ""mr chainsaw"" and ""i'm dying tomorrow"", then pass up this cd on the shelf. If you want something to accompany your new foundglory/starting line collection then you might want to buy 2 copies incase the first one gets scratched. Its worth a listen to, and the cd doesn't make me want to regirgitate my soul, but like a parent tired of reprimanding i know they could have done better and thats all i need to say."
5,Amazing!!!!! Worth every cent,"Ok, at first i'll have to admit, i only liked about 2 songs on the whole cd. but then i was like, ""well, i guess i'll have another listen"". and i was totally hooked!!! the more i listened to it the more i fell in love with it. and while most of the songs are simple, they are soo catchy! Alkaline is awesome at writing darker lyrics and its just a good cd all the way through. i highly reccomend it to anyone who likes strait up punk!"
2,A Major step down for one of my favorite bands,"I love these guys, they are amazing.But when I look at this CD, I cannot think of a lot of good things to say. These guys have shown, in there first three full length albumns, that they are extremley talented. They didn't lose there talent on the move to Vagrant, so why the sudden change? what went wrong?Well first of all, The CD doesn't have a lot of variation. And it becomes very repetitive, it has now ""Stand-out"" songs. Granted, it has a few good tracks, such as: ""Fatally Yours"" and ""Emma"", most of the other songs seem very dull. I think these guys tried too hard to make a dark albumn, and they lost focus of just playing the music.The lyrics are probley my biggest complaint on this CD. They sound incredibly cheesey, either that, or Matt just doesn't sound as convincing as he was before.Im seeing these guys play November 7th, and as I said before, they are one of my favorites, and an amazing band.Im waiting too see what there next CD brings :)"
3,Haven't we heard this album before?,"Not to say that this CD is bad, it isn't at all, but the majority of it sounds like ""From Here to Infirmary"". I guess I was just hoping they would one up themselves this time. Definately worth the money though, and pick up their other albums while you're at it. My favorite songs are ""Fatally Yours"", ""This Could be Love"", ""We've had Enough"", and ""If We Never Go Inside""."
5,Actually good pop punk!,"Punk usually is something that is not that tasteful to me, it seems to lack concept and is often repetitive, but Good Mourning blew me away man! The CD does not easily get old, and is very catchy in a good way. There is something good and unusual in punk here, and its worth bying. Punk people, also try THE OFFSPRING's cd SMASH."
2,the first two songs are good and thats it,"I was expecting an amazing album. And I was disappointed. The only songs worthwhile are the first two ""this could be love"" and ""we've had enough,"" besides that, the whole album is just boring and the same. You wont even know song from song. So like I said download the first two and forget buying the cd."
2,middling emo punk,"i'll say htis for alk3- they do get a little better eacxh new album, not much but a little. this and from here to inf... are th only two albums by these gatecrashers that i could stomach if i were you. seriously, leave this disposable crite for the tennyboppers and mtv swayed FOOLs. If you want strong heartfelt music- there's plenty out there far far better than this."
3,A pretty good album,"If you're a fan of extremely sad love songs, you'll like this album. If you're someone who is offended by acts of suicide and homicide in songs... you might wanna skip this CD. Its a good alkaline trio CD but its not their best. This CD does hold one of the greatest lines from a love song ever though... in my opinion anyways, ""So what do you say... your coffin or mine?"""
4,Still My Boys,"As a long-time fan, and Chicagoan, I can say that the Alkaline Trio may have gained more press with this album but have far from sold out. It is more of a pain to have to deal with more people fighting for the CDs, merch, and tickets, and to let my boys out to the rest of the world, but if anyone deserves it, they do. This album is slightly BETTER than From Here To Infirmary in my opinion, with the worst song on the CD being the radio single. Good Mourning is a strong effort, and well worth the price."
4,a bit different sound but all around pretty good,"I cant remember the first time i heard the alkaline trio but whenever it was this band hit me like no other band ever has.With their new album ""Good Mourning"" i had mixed feelings i felt it is a good album overall but has a much different sound than past albums. If you are a new listener to the alkaline trio i would advise you to go out and buy thier first albums before getting this, but if you are a fan who is familiar with their older albums i definatly recommend going out and getting this album it is a great album that can stand tall with their other albums as well as add i new dimension to the trio that i personally like."
1,there is no way that this is any good.,"from here to infirmary was good. not as good as goddammit, the singles collection or maybe i'll catch fire. the hell yes 7"" and the split with hot water music are also both really good. this change is damn near inexplicable. oh well. nobody really cares that much about this album. for every band that changes their sound and makes it big... (dashboard, saves the day, nfg, the ataris, afi, many many others...) there will always be bands who change their sound and nobody likes the new sound (JULIANA THEORY). whatever. check out armor for sleep, minus the bear, the red hot valentines, and the macho man randy savage."
3,"Solid, but a little dissapointing","Good Mourning is not a bad album. It has some memorable songs like We Had Enough and Continental, however, overall the album is a bit dissapointing. It does not have the same energy that previous efforts like From Here to Infirmary have. So don't make this your first Alkaline Trio CD. Get a hold of their eariler stuff, it is sure to not dissapoint!"
3,Ehhh...Get the older stuff,"Having been a big fan of the Trio for quite awhile now, I greatly anticipated this cd. Its a good cd, but its pretty polished. Plus when they recorded this cd Matt's voice was having problems, and you can notice it on this cd. Especially Blue in the Face, his voice sounds like he's sick. Its still a good cd, but if you're new to Alk 3 get Goddamnit or Self titled singles. Those are the best."
3,Goddamnit!,"I first heard the Alkaline Trio ep ""For your lungs only"" when it came out around 1997 or 1998 and fell in love with the great band from Chicago. They're linked through Dan Adriano to the great ska band Slapstick that he performed in prior to their break up in 1997 and thought the Alkaline Trio were just as good or even better than Slapstick. From my freshman year of high school to now, it seems as if their albums got progressivly worse since ""For your lungs only"" and ""Goddamnit"". Non of their albums are bad, but the quality of songs from those first recordings are lacking now. I recommend that nobody should buy this as their first Alkaline Trio album. This is a decent album for long time fans, but I miss the days of Snake Oil Tanker, I lied my face off, and Nose over tail. If your looking for their best recordings, and possibly some of the best punk/emo songs around, check out ""Goddamnit"" and the compilation of all their ep's and rare tracks on ""The Alkaline Trio"""
4,This record makes you happy to be sad.,"My first try with this band of emo-poppunkers other than hearing a couple of comp tracks here and there and I'll admit that although this sounds very slick and polished it's damn hard not to toe-tap and hum along once you pop this disc in. There is definitely a morbid sense of humor here and a higher than normal fascination with the macabre and you would think that would lead to a doomy gloomy and mopey record. Not if your main songwriter is Matt Skiba. He can sing about self mutilation, drug use and the various other downer topics on this record and still make you want to dance along. Another thing this band has going for them is that the bass player also writes and sings too making for an even more varied approach in the songs. If it says anything about this record and for what it's worth, I've already ordered 3 of their other discs."
1,Actually a 200 pin chip (not as shown),"Amazon seems to be having a problem connecting the right picture to this item. The item they will actually send is a 200 pin PC2 4200, not the 240 pin format as shown. Therefore it will not fit in the desktop. Big disappointment."
2,Not great,The price and service were exemplary. However the series has no fluidity or any real direction. There are some naughty parts in the first disc of the series. But then they didn't know which way to take it. They just kept making them anyway
4,Eh not the best Tenchi,I was so hoping that this was the Tenchi that I had watched a while ago but alas it is not. Also none of the voice actors were the same as in the older Tenchi shows. I did like it but it was also very confusing to what I was used to in a Tenchi show. So I don't disapprove of it I just would rather watch Tenchi in Tokyo or Tenchi Universe.
5,Tenchi + fiancee = anything one can think of,"Tenchi Muyo - Ryo Ohki continues after the first OVA series.... which features some of the scenes (in flashbacks).After meeting Ryoko, Ryo Ohki, Aeyka, Sasami, Mihoshi and Washu, Tenchi meets even more women... including Noikehis fiancee, which leads to the classic mayhem that fans of the series know and love (and explaining a number ofissues). The rest of the series, I couldn't mention without giving it away... it does lead into GXP nicely.I salute `Ryo Ohki'."
5,Magnifecent Ryo-Ohki,"LOL this is a crack up movie it is really funny i should know i own it, i couldnt stop laughing at the cast well all the movies of Tenchi are funny but this one is da best!P.S. Ryo-Ohki is hilarious and Ayeka,Ryoko,Sasami and Tenchi this movie is really something to crack up about!"
2,Amazon should be ashamed of themselves,"Half the reviews here aren't even for Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-ohki OAV3 boxset, but for completely different Tenchi series or movies which have their own merits and defects.Before they lumped everything together last year or the year before that, this particular product had 2-1/2 stars and 8-9 reviews or thereabouts. Amazon certainly doesn't send you all the products for the price of one! But somehow saw the need to hide all the negative reviews by this tactic.OAV3 just has my scorn. It's certainly not in the spirit of OAV1/2, it relies heavily on the background which was never officially translated into English, and a lot of characters/situations come out of nowhere because of that. I didn't like it but others may.My greater concern is how Amazon is treating it's customers like crap by lying to them in their faces -- if you didn't read the reviews carefully, you may be thinking this is a 5-star product. It is not."
4,Funny and Worth It!,"This Series which premiered on Cartoon Network(Cut) is now on DVD in a 4 disc series completing the ""Tenchi Muyo OVA"" Series. This DVD contains the first 4 episodes and is funny. It is the beginning of a long comedic action packed series. This is the first DVD you want to buy, following the other 3 for the ""Tenchi Muyo OVA"" Series. Then I Suggest the following series, Tenchi Universe. The Episodes are all UNCUT containing slight language, violence, sexual humor/situations etc. Not Recomended for Children under 13 Years of Age. I highly recomend this series to all people above 13 for Humor and a all around great T.V. Series."
4,One of the best,"In episode 8 Tenchi's aunt drops off her little son, all the girls try to take care of the baby but dont have much luck. So Washu finds that she must take over. You find out washu's secret, that she once to had a baby! In episode 9 Sasami feels loney, she also has a secret she hasen't told anybody. Its about why her and Tsunami are connected. On the day Ryoko attacked she fell and almost died. The secret has hounded Sasami and now she tells everyone."
3,Upset to find its not the whole series,"I was expecting all of the OVA series to be in this boxset but its only 7 episodes of them all. Do not purchase if you believe you are going to get every episode to this entire series because you will not get it. It seems to be the last 7 episodes on 3 discs and thats it along with some special features.I was pretty disappointed when I recieved this and it wasnt what I thought I was getting ""The whole OVA series"""
4,Interesting.....,"This is a good anime, but not the best. I'd prefer it to many other anime, but it still has some parts where you're like ""My God, are they done yet?"" but they're worth it for all of the awesome scenes. But all anime have their flaws, so this is a nice anime DVD to own."
2,Boccaccio,"Prey is a natural in the title role, with comedy built into the voice. Still, this was written for a tenor and performed by a soprano at the premiere. So why a baritone here? Rothenberger sounds old for Fiametta, particularly in relation to the women whose characters are older than hers. The rest of the solo singing passes muster. But the so-so chorus is recorded in a boxy acoustic and its words are muffled. This matters because the crowd's reactions drive the story (the writer Boccaccio causes scandals). The conducting lacks imagination. There is a flaw in the horn playing near the start of the overture. The 1974 sound-picture suggests a studio, not a live theater.Sadly, this seems to be the only complete version of Boccaccio ever made. The Marco Polo label of Naxos started a Suppé series but never got to this work, which may be the composer's strongest."
1,Customer Service Horrible,I contacted the company through the website what the percentage of aggregate versus acrylic polymer was and they told me NONE OF HIS BUSINESS. Because of their unprofessional conduct I would suggest finding something else.
4,Tina,"I have been wanting a grille guard for my '93 Bronco for years. When I started actively shopping for one, I knew that I wanted a Go Rhino! because of how well their push bumpers perform. I have been quite pleased with my grille guard, although I had to get used to the difference in my truck's handling with it installed (the additional 85 pounds are noticeable). I had also purchased a pair of driving lights, which went on the grille guard quite easily. Delivery was prompt and my package arrived undamaged."
2,A Bleeder.,"The first thing I noticed when I turned on this monitor is the the colors bleed out about 1/4"" around the screen. I have a black background, and it is fairly obvious. I noticed this when playing games as well.I did not notice any ghosting and text is very sharp."
5,ITS A WHOLE LOT OF THERAPY FOR THE PRICE OF A BOOK,"As A reader, I can honestly tell you. It's a whole lot of therapy for the price of a book! If all mankind could come to the realization of life that Dawn Kohler arrived at through her struggle to survive, to heal, and to understand, the world would be a better place to life in. Her road to recovery through therapy and an awesome spiritual encounter she expienced is beautiful and yet frightening. Her journey is one that every human being, religious and non religious should read about for their own health, their own personal growth and their own spiritual growth."
4,Nina Ramsby Rules!,"I saw this alternative metal trio play live in NYC in 1996, when Auscultate was first released, and as awesome as they were, both live and on tape, they turned out to be yet another example of a great, unique-sounding band that fell through the cracks in the commercial music landscape. Their sound is straight-ahead guitar rock on the surface, but yields a number of quirky chords changes, propelled by songwriter/vocalist Nina Ramsby's continuously curious lyrics and intriguing melodies. More tuneful than the Melvins and less abrasive than Jawbox, Salt was a female-fronted breath of fresh air in the 90's alterna-scape. After Salt folded, Nina went on to perform in the drum&bass/trip-hop combo Baxter, whose sole album is also well worth checking out."
1,Feminist Propaganda,"Reading this book filled me with an undescribable rage. It was nothing more than feminist propaganda for chapter after chapter. This book would not appeal to anyone other than feminists, so men and us regular women should stay away. The only reason I gave it a ""1"" is that's the lowest score. I would have givin it a ""-8"" if I could have."
1,Not comfortable,"Gave my mother these shoes for Christmas last year. Recently when I met her again, she said that she had not worn the shoes at all as the top of the shoe was hurting her foot so badly that she can't even wear it out the front door. The size is correct as the width and length of the shoe fits perfectly."
1,Not true to size and low quality,"These shoes are at least a size larger than the marked size and they do not live up to the quality that I have found in Easy Spirit shoes in the past.I have several pairs of ES shoes and they are all true to size and a good value for the price--but these are not a good value even if they had fit--regardless of the reduced price. I did not return them because with the shipping,etc., it would not be cost effective to do so. I will donate them to a local charity, and I will think twice about ordering shoes online in the future."
3,It's OK,"Not the best, not the worst, a couple of new songs here and there, a couple of nice trancey ones. I've heard better CDs"
5,this book got me into taxi driving,This is a true view behind the yellow curtain of the taxi staging lot at any major airport in the states. And how owners and drivers interact.
5,Definitely better than 2003,"There are a lot of things better about 2005 that make it worth the jump from 2003. Most of them you'll just have to use the software yourself to realize, but a few big ones are:-VASTLY improved intellisense, especially with ASP.NET pages,-New language features with .NET 2.0,-Rather intelligent and visually appealing positioning help in Windows forms,-Improved XML support,-Lots moreThere are a few things that annoy me, from time to time, such as seemingly random bouts of sitting there for 30-40 seconds, looking like it's hung.The website copy tool, while still something that 2003 didn't have, needs work.Various other little things that need a tad of polishing.Microsoft, HAS, however, promised a service pack, so I'm sure a lot of things will be fixed or enhanced.Overall, I recommend this release as a smart upgrade from 2003 or earlier."
2,Useless for existing VS 2003 projects,"As usual, Microsoft has released an unbelievably buggy, product that wants to force you to start all your work from scratch, even after the release of the first service pack. Trying to convert ANY project created with Visual Studio 2003 will result in a myriad of problems:1) Forms that won't load and present with various cryptic messages with no specifics;2) Random crashes that cause VS to close mysteriously3) Applications that will appear to run then at some point come up with errors claiming that you may have corrupted memory.etc.I admit that I have not started a brand new major project since all the issues on old projects failed in one way or another."
1,Only game in town,"I don't find the product as easy to work with as its predecessors, but this is the way Microsoft is pushing application development, so it is a ""must-have""."
3,Not too happy with amazon and their support of this item,"I wish I had the opportunity to evaluate the actual product.The COA for Visual Studio is nowhere to be found.I received the item with 2 COA's for SQL server developer edition by mistake.Amazon's reply? Call the following 800 number and deal with Microsoft. BTW I was given the wrong number to call too.Ohhhh nice... So... hour or so later, Microsoft could not get me a COA to use.Utter waste of time.I suggest purchasing elsewhere. If you have problems it is doubtful Amazon will do anything to rectify them sending you bad product."
4,Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2005,"Although I have not used the product as much as I would like, from installation to using the help documentation, I believe I will benifit in upgrading from the Microsoft Visual Basic 6 product. Lots of good improvements."
5,One of Dermalogica's best!,"True to its name, this product is one of the best and mildest chemical exfoliant there is out there. This is non-irritating and great for sensitive and acne-prone skin. I love the fact that it's not grainy, therefore the smooth consistency makes for an easy and mess-free application. The BHA and AHA combination really helps clear congestion without drying your skin and you can really see the difference in your skin after using this.I have combination skin, which is prone to occasional breakouts, and I use this twice a week. This is like an instant pick-me-up for lackluster skin. You will notice how smooth and glowing your face is afterwards. If you are looking for an alternative to harsh scrubs, you will absolutely love this mask exfoliant. I have tried other exfoliants and keep going back to this. And while the price seems a little steep, you only need to use a little so this will last you a while."
1,Just watch who you buy it from!,"I purchased this product and instead I got four sample containters. They didn't only look old, but the did not have a sealed box or experation date. Plase make sure you buy genuine DERMALOGICA products. Don't make the same mistake I did.."
3,ok,its an ok product. doesnt really exfoliate by itself but it definitely loosens your blocked pores. if you use it then use a blackhead tool then it actually accomplishes exfoliation.
4,Nice and gentle!,"This truly is a gentle exfoliant. It works nicely, isn't harsh at all and leaves the skin looking and feeling refreshed and healthy!"
3,nice but pricey,"I have been trying this cream exfoliant and while it feels good, I'm not sure whether it actually does anything and whether it is worth the price. I think I will do yogurt masks instead - a lot cheaper and 100% lactic acid."
1,NOT IPHONE COMPATIBLE!,"Yes, I'd prefer a zero star option as well. The plug does not fit in the iphone, it is the smaller plug size used in older flip cell phones. I'll have to return it. What a waste of time."
2,church accounting,"This truly is a basic book. It deals substantially with controls and not as much with accounting peculiar to churches, based on accepted accounting principles. Basic is the operative word. Not much help to someone having an understanding of for profit accounting and looking specifically for help with proper church accounting."
3,Nice but shades insanely,"I have a dual feeling about the rug. It is certainly very beautiful. It is thick and soft. However, it sheds tremendously. Apparently what makes the rug cheaper is that manufacturer skips the washing part of the wool preparation... and leaves this part to customers. I would not recommend buying it for the families with toddlers. The wool remnants shed on your clothing and hands when you play on it. Toddlers may get serious gastrointestinal issues from swallowing this amount of wool. And believe me, the amount is huge. Not only on the carpet but in the surrounding areas as well.It has gotten better in the second month but it still adds a lot of cleaning work to daily routine."
5,Nothing Short of Magical Genius..,"Chillingly beautiful vocals, dreamy pianos, steady beats, and a perfect strings assortment, this record has it all. This steady record keeps you hooked from the beginning piano loop of ""One Note,"" till the equally haunting ""Apocalypse."" Each and every song holds its weight, bringing the eerie magic around gypsies to music. I strongly recomend this record, whose only fault is being six songs long, too anyone and everyone. After hearing Mira Billotte's voice, you won't regret it!"
4,Good sci fi,I saw this film only when it was shown on B&W TV in the '50s and didn't know about the green tint gimmic until I watched the DVD.
2,Eh.,"Brave men climb a volcano. Brave men shoot some exotic fauna. Brave men recover missing object and climb down volcano. Island holding volcano then explodes. The end.That's pretty much the whole movie. Of course, it's possible to strip any movie down to a handful of essential plot points like that; the problem is, this movie comes pre-stripped, as it were. There really is nothing else to this film. That, and a little unnecessary filler involving some severity dated attitudes on dating, a tad of moralizing about communism and a couple of dashes of pseudoscience, and you have a relatively dull hour, lost forever. Unless you really, really like war-buddy movies, it's hard to recommend this one for anything.It probably played better when communism was a hot topic."
3,Hey! Romero did a dinomovie!,"This is a typical 50's atomic era adventure/sci-fi film. Ceasar Romero leads a military expedition toa ridiculously high mountaintop to find a lost rocket. And I do mean RIDICULOUSLY high. About 1/3 of this movie is footage of them climbing the mountain. Atop the escartment, they find a green-tinted world inhabited by play-doh dinosaurs. One of the few dinomovies not to have a predatory dinosaur. An entertaining movie nonetheless."
2,Still Missing Scenes,"OK, from the other reviews I have concluded that this is still a cut-up version. Sid Melton's ""death scene"" is missing (Romero puts a cig between his blood-oozing lips before he cashs his chips in and tells them to say goodby to the plane for him). Some of the earthquake scenes are probably missing also (Acquanetta's demise - if my memory serves me correct they used the ""lava flow overcomes cavegirl"" stock footage from 1 Million Years BC - Now you think, ""Say, what did happen to those other villagers?""). Sinister Cinema advised me some years ago that whoever owns the rights was just too lazy or stupid to restore them properly. Boycott it until they do it right. Pitiful! It was one of my favorites as a child."
4,A great old time war-monster-action classic!,It has all of the crucial elements: U.S. Military equipment Cheezy MonstersOnly drawback is it is missing one scene when one guy gets killed they were supposed to give him a cigerette.
3,CLASSIC FUN,"I loved this film as a child, and I still enjoy it. The film used to air on the old WNEW in New York City back in the early and mid 1960s. Of course, I don't know how much of the enjoyment of the movie comes from the nostalgia. One thing I noticed is that it's a major cigarette add. The dialogue is very clever abeit politically incorrect in many ways. ""What, and have some wife tell him what dames he should or shouldn't go out with? Not, Joe."" According to one of your reviewers, the Sid Melton scene toward the end is cut half way through. It is also cut on a differently packaged copy which I purchased some years ago. That's unfortunate, as the scene is very moving. It shows a lack of responsibility on the part of the releasing companies."
5,Excellent for its time (1951),"Considering the time in which this movie was made (1951) and considering the limitations on budget, actors, special effects, etc., this film is probably one of the best science fiction films per cost that has ever been made."
3,Fair enough,"Major Joe Nolan (Caesar Romero) is leading a group of men (Huge Beaumont, Sid Melton, Whit bisttel, Chick Chalder and John Hoyt) into an island where they must retrieve an atomic rocket that vanished as their plane crashes on that island. They search teh siland and climb a very tall mountain as they are attacked by dinosaurs once they get to the top and must find that rocket.I gotta say this is a rather decent 1951 Sci-fi fantasy adventure flick with a decent cast but poorly executed. The acting isn't half bad but there is 20 minutes of mountain climbing within the film that drags the film's pacing then we get to Dinosaur land on the top which even the dinosaur's stop motion animation is quite as good as other stop motion effects and a decent ending. Although the MST3K version is much better, it's not that bad enough but the boys had fun riffing it."
2,"Hand me the pop corn,will ya!","This flic really brings back the memories of Saturday afternoon Movie matinees. The premise of the picture is good....but thats about it. Mr. Romero must have really needed the money or he was at the end of a contract.....I was waiting for the ""Beaver"" and/or Wally to come out and smack Hugh Beaumont in the chops! Then I remembered niether on of them had been born yet or they were still in the cradle whent this movie was made. A thorough restoration would have been good but I guess you can only spread the bucks so far. This is MST 3000 bound for sure(if it hasnt been on already)."
2,Good stop motion includes Pterodactyl!!,"Surprised to see a stop motion Pterodactyl in this one. Great scenes of attacking dinosaurs killed violently by bloodletting gunfire. I found the story to be boring but the dinosaur scenes were green tinted, exciting and also greatly scored. Not sure who did the music but it was first rate!! Better than 'Unknown Island' but I still prefer 'The Land Unknown' or 'The Land That Time Forgot' for a good, cheap dino-adventure. Gee Wally, that Eddie is such a creep..."
3,Lost Continent,"classic B sci fi at it best and worst, some very long climbing scenes are a bit trying for patience, but fun anyway you look at it."
5,Raw Talent,"Part of the charm of Daniel Johnston, especially on this CD, is that despite the complete amateur quality of the recordings, there are some truly remarkable musical moments on this CD. I consider Walking The Cow to be one of the most haunting songs I have ever heard. And Running Water features one of the simplist poetic lyrics I have ever heard.This CD is definately not for the impatient, but if you are tired of the same old stuff you can hardly get any more different than Daniel Johnston."
3,album art details,"Tracks 1-14 are from Continued Story, and 15-29 are from Hi, How Are You.Art details:The cover is a detail from (presumably) each of the original albums covers, which are reproduced in the CD: The full picture corresponding to Continued Story includes an odd cycle of people emerging from/into people (a bit hindu-esque). The picture corresponding to Hi, How Are You has two more beasties picnicking alongside the frog/alien dude."
5,Long time user,"As the operator of a small organic Christmas Tree farm, I've used horticultural oils for many years. I also use this oil in the orchard as a dormant spray on apples, pears, peaches and blueberries. All Seasons is competitively priced with other brands and does the job as described. I wouldn't be without it."
5,Worked against scale on hibiscus,I bought this to use on my hibiscus plants which had become covered in snow scale insects. It worked very well with only 2 applications.
2,TERRIBLE Instructions for use,"Why do gardening products like pesticides and fungicides have such confusing directions. Why can't they just tell you how to use the product in regular English. For instance look at this quote - do you have any idea what it means? ""Consult your experiment station for proper timing and choice of fungicide to use with ALL SEASONS HORTICULTURAL AND DORMANT SPRAY OIL."" Then there are conflicting directions. IMPORTANT: Do not spray again with oil for at least a month. NOTICE: Do not exceed 3 consecutive applications without allowing a two week application interval. Why can't these companies do a better job of explaining the proper use of their products? [...]"
5,Great Lounge Music,I fell in love with this C.D. from the beginning. A few friends have gone out to buy it after listening to it.Great music for hanging out with friends or listening in the car.
1,forget it.,"There's no Latin spirit inside that extrange album.It tries to be ""something easy to hear for discovering Lating moods...""i'm a latin guy, but that record is......anything but latin lounge...i don't even think is Latin. it just don qualify, it has no real Latin Spirit, i'll say it: It's a Damn FREAK.Please Run away, like the pleague."
1,Panasonic PV-V464S 4-Head Hi-Fi VCR (Silver),"First I thought it had Ad-Cut, it said in the discription that it would cut out the ads. My sister has one exactly like it and it cuts them out automatically, so nice. Also the remote is soooo slow. On my old one I could fast forward and rewind to exactly where I wanted it. This one takes forever to stop and forever to start so I have to fool with it back and forth or just miss some of the program. The picture is good but I would not buy it the second time."
4,Where's the DVD????,"No reason to write another review of this great forgotten classic. Let's plead for a DVD release! With all the junk being released, why overlook the really good ones? This is a WONDERFUL film!"
3,"Funk mob plays ""jazz""","This is a ""jazz"" cd with some vocals from P-funker Belita Woods, mike hampton playing guitar,etal. It's only O.K. at best"
4,"""EMO"" WITH AN ACTUAL SENSE OF HUMOR","This is an early release from the Flying Nun label, home to such songwriting geniuses as Chris Knox and the other guy from The Tall Dwarves. Apparently, this particular album is out of stock, but I see it all the time in used bins, usually for less than $5. My friend lent me this album last week, and I must've listened to it fifteen times, start to finish- it's utterly brilliant. I wish I could force all the morons who get off on Sunny Day Real Estate to listen to this, so they could see how much better emotive lyrics and music can be when the songwriter doesn't take himself quite so seriously. I'm 25 years old, and, having listened to this kind of stuff for ages, I didn't expect to be so genuinely moved by lyrics about relationships. Buy this album now, wherever you can find it, and you'll see what I mean."
1,Don't buy this horrible movie!!!,"It deserves absolutely NO stars! The acting is atrocious. The heroine speaks in a monotone, ho-hum voice throughout the entire movie, whether she's discussing running the dude ranch w/ her mother, identifying a dead body, or being attacked by a maniac. She would have been a shoe-in for a role on NAPOLEON DYNAMITE.Her mother looks like she must have had her when she was about four! And talk about homely! No wonder the missing dad had another family living in Arizona (ugh!) Apparently he was also messing around with some old German hag from his workplace, too (who the mother actually calls ""beautiful"" when she sees her picture in the paper).The so-called hero-boyfriend had actually broken up with our heroine a couple of years before and married someone else, whom he now refers to as ""the mistake.""The list could go on, but I'll close with saying that my copy of this movie is in the trash where it belongs."
1,good frag but....,"great frag, very cheap bottle, first one arrived almost half empty ( brand new. but only half) amazon was kind enough to send me a second bottle with out charge, but the second bottles the spray was broken, gust who ever is making the bottle isn't very good at it"
3,"Good product, bad description work","Advertised to charge 4-AAs in two hours. Heck, it took me about 6 hours. But it does charge, that's a good thing.I think it drains the battery empty before fully charge. It's a good move to extend the battery life.Also used on RadioChack rechargeables and works."
2,When is it charged and when is it not,"I have no idea when my batteries are charged up. Sometimes the blinking will stop after 5 mins, sometimes 3 hours. When I put the batteries (Duracell 2650 Mah)in my camera, they die after 20 shots. Is there something wrong with the charger or the batteries?? Anyway, Duracell sucks!!!"
2,You get what you pay for..,"I got a good deal on this battery charger, but it isn't even worth what I paid. I have only used this charger once or twice a month, so the usage has been very light. With a brand name like Duracell, I expected this charger to be of good quality. It worked fine for the first few months, but not any longer. After the batteries are ""fully charged"" I will put them in my electronic devices, but they are still out of juice."
1,I wish I can give it a 0 star,"I bought it to replace my old Olympus charger which finally broke down after 3 year in service. I have been fighting with it since then. I am now thinking of buying a Sony or whatever (but not Duracell) to power my digital cameras up.It does not work for my Olympus and Energizer rechargables which worked well with my old chargers. It blinks for about 30 min and indicates the batteries are full -- not a pleasant supprise!!Stay away from this charger, it will cost you more than the money!!!"
3,I need help!,If somebody has the manual please post it because I lost it before reading it. I need to understand what each LED means and when to recognize when batteries are charged.
4,Cute Concept,"I liked the idea of creating memory books from fabric. Baby books, books of old photos, books to give at graduation, those would all lend themselves to this concept. I could see this being a simple sewing project with lots of possibilities for beginners. Making a memory book for Grandma would be a great project for summer for kids. Lots of concepts and techniques are explained in this book, but there are not specific patterns. This book would help anyone like me who wants to find a creative way to display special mementos and memories."
5,Inspirational!,"One of my absolute favorites. The first part of the book gives you all the information you need to get started, including techniques, tools, stitches, etc. All well explained, including visuals. Perfect for beginners & advanced crafters alike. The second part is full of gorgeous projects with step-by-step instruction. All are well within the capabilities of any level of crafter, as it is not so much the construction of the books that is inspired, but rather it is what you do to embellish them that is key. And the last part of the book gives you several pages of examples of cloth books made by others. Lots of inspiration on the possibilites of various embellishment techniques there. I am just wild for this book and am itching to get started!"
1,"Hated The Children's Hour""","Rambled. Poorly told story. Did not hold my interest. Enjoyed other books by the author but this one lost my interest and I never finished it. In my case, it is rare that I don't finish a book, even one for which I do not care."
5,The Best Christmas Gift Ever,"I have been bemoaning the fact to my family for months that 'The Children's Hour' wasn't arriving in Canada until the summer of 2004. Much to my surprise it was wrapped and under our tree, a gift from my wonderful daughter!Once I picked it up on Boxing Day, I sat and read it until 2 a.m. I couldn't put it down. Her descriptions take you into another world and you become engrossed in the characters. I like a book that goes back and forth from the present to the past as this one does. Her characters are well-rounded and some so easy to love.There are several secrets afloat throughout the novel, but, one in particular made me gasp out loud, and was another completely unexpected.As much as I've loved all your books Marcia, I think this one will be very hard to top! Congratuations on a job well done!"
4,A Willett Winner,"After reading ""A Week in Winter"", I couldn't wait to get into ""The Children's Hour"". Marcia Willett really crafts interesting characters and you find yourself thinking about them even when you're not turning the pages!I especially like her inclusion of the importance of the dogs within the family. This adds even more depth and reality to the characters. We all know that dogs ""have opinions"" about what goes on with their humans! This is, by no means overdone in the book, but the dogs'personalities add to the richness of the story's background.I was sorry when the story was over."
5,rosamunde pilcher fans rejoice!,"Who doesn't want to recall an idyllic childhood, complete with siblings and beaches, pets and unlimited adult attention? And if you didn't have that for yourself, then reading about it might be almost as good! In this Rosamunde Pilcher/Maeve Binchy style novel, the ""children"" who sat dreamily around a cherished adult who read them books during the ""children's hour"", are now in their 60s and 70s. A unique story unfolds, as we learn of their childhood as the now old ladies tell their childhood memories to each other and to younger family members. Their lives (and the plot) are not without conflict, however. There are secrets that are told, shocking the characters and the reader. Set in a relaxing family estate that has been broken in by generations, the novel is refreshing, relaxing and entertaining."
2,A very light read,"By reading the other reviews, I know I'll sound unpopular now, but I can't help it. I don't mind a good novel based on past reminiscences where loves stories are remembered and new ones ensue, but I found this particular book to have no depth whatsoever. True, it's a light read indeed and one I'd have avoided had I not spent my money on it.On the good side, the prose is studied and quite elegant. However, most characters, their feelings and surroundings are described in such a repetitive way, it goes on and on. Yes, there are some ""twists & turns"", but the bottom line is, this is just the typical he-loves-her-she-loves-him-but-fate-gets-in-the-way kind of story, which takes the reader from past to present back to the past again. Quite predictable too and much too goody-goody for my taste, to the point where the characters seem unreal."
4,FOR EXPORT,"It was a great pleasure to find a so high quality live recording, much better than anyone could expect. Recorded in Tokio, with special setlist and made specially for exportation and overseas countries, whoever appreciates Brazilian music with the best musical arrangements could have been performed, will enjoy and ask for ENCORE!"
3,Good live performance,"I love Gal Costa's voice and phrasing, which on this album is, as always, exceptional, but there are better live albums out there. Although she only appears on a few numbers, the live album, Rio Revisited, recorded in LA in 1987, is much better. This CD is the music from the live video featuring Jobim and crew, so if you want to see as well as hear her, check out the video as well."
3,Bad sax not alway better than no sax at all.,"The sax player stinks. The band is good otherwise. Pity you cannot edit out the sax players cliches. Sounds like he belongs on an 80's smooth jazz record. This could be a 5 star disc if he could be eliminated from the mix. Gal sounds fine and has some interesting selection choices. IMHO she and Bethania are the two most gifted of all the Brazilian singers. Oddly while Bethania seems to shine the brightest when in front of a live audience, Gal seems to be more at home in the studio. As one other reviewer mentioned, the 80's release of her guest appearance with Jobim's family band live in Los Angeles is perhaps her finest live session. Unfortunately most of that performance is not available on the CD, but appears only on the VHS version. There is a poor quality DVD transfer out there, but honestly my old VHF has better quality video and audio."
4,"Unspectacular, but very nice - -","(should have had Kristan, her official translator on hand; only kidding)- she handled the conversation pretty well, actually - - - sure didn't sound like a 61 year old woman; doesn't look her age either. Four superb back-up musicians -- some wiggy guitar changes snuck-in there, good bass and subtle percussion. Gal Costa sounded fine, and it's simply a nice addition to my collection - - - one I'll play on our boat while cruising in the Gulf, or out by the pool until we're able to return to beautiful Rio next year."
3,A product of its time.,"This book is reprinted exactly as it appeared in the 1970s, and it shows.If you're the sort of person who needs lots of diagrams, look elsewhere."
5,Great book for self study,"I'd like very much this book. The book is very conceptual and also rigorous. It is self-consistent and this facilate his study. It progress step by step. If you need an Introduction, for self study this is a right book for starting. His writting style is very clear and the edition is also very good. The only defect I found is that there is no solutions for the excersices."
5,Very concise and right to the point...,"This is a good place to start if you want to learn Topology. The author wastes no time or words here; do not expect a ""popularization"" type book. This is theorems, lemmas, corollaries, equations, proofs, etc., and not much else. I, for one, am grateful for that!"
4,Great introduction,"Having just retired from a science career and looking at widening my maths,I have found this a great introduction to topology is just what I was after."
4,"good review, but no answers for the exercises!","I enjoyed this book. It is a nice introduction to topology for undergraduates. It presupposes very little mathematical background. It is clear and well-written. Chapter 1 is a good introduction to set theory, Chapter 2 to metric spaces, Chapter 3 to topological spaces, Chapter 4 to connectedness, Chapter 5 to compactness. There are many exercises given. But I have one big problem with this book as a self-study guide: answers to the exercises are not provided. So I give it only 4 stars."
4,Great for the price,"I had one semester of real analysis prior to picking up this book. I found it's presentation of metric spaces OK, though Mendelson seems happy enough with abstract definitions that he doesn't always try to help with developing some intuition. This book is probably pretty hard to read if you're not familiar with metric spaces.Mendelson introduces topological spaces very well, though, with lots of examples, counterexamples, and explanations of both. It's dense reading (though not open-dense, ha-ha) but it is worth it. Definitely a good first book on topology."
5,dancing queen,I watch this one over and over again. There are so many different styles of mucic and dancing on this one. Aishwarya Rai is one of the most graceful dancers. Her beauty is just as captivating. Not to mention all the hairstyles and jewelry. Great fun and always loved when I invite others to watch with me.
3,Works great - at first,Works as advertised. Haven't had any trouble at all. Outlasts the battery I originally got for my phones. Works great.Edit: could be that the phones are old but this battery is not holding up during long conversations - say 2 hours. I had to swap phones and charge the other battery.
5,Monty Alexander Yard Movement,"I heard Sneeky Steppers while havind dinner in Jamaica earlier this year. I instantly wanted to know the name of the song and the group that played the song. Upon my return to the states I headed for Amazon and checked for the CD. The first song, six and seven are outstanding songs. This was my first introduction to Monty Alexander and I""m looking for more CD'S. This CD is difficult to find, but worth every penny spent. ENJOY!!!"
4,Technical yet understandable,Maybe just a tad bit too technical for a neewbie like me. Lots of great info.
5,This book is the real thing,"As an owner of a mid sized WISP, the author has captured the real life problem we experience both from a strategic and field perspective. From antenna alternatives, pros and cons of varying polarization, business issues to consider and multitudes of other factors that must be balanced to support a customer service organization delivering wireless internet services. Thanks! My entire staff was required to read this book cover to cover."
5,I DARE YOU TO LISTEN TO THIS AND NOT GET UP & DANCE,"Simply wonderful fun...as a native of N'Awlins for many generations, we have had the pleasure of dancing to Rockin' Dopsie, Jr & Sr, live performances. This is the best of the joy music can bring to an otherwise ordinary day."
2,PARKER & BAILEY STAINLESS STEEL POLISH,"THIS DIDN'T TAKE THE STAINS OUT OF MY SINK. IT DID MAKE IT SHINY, BUT THE SHINE DIDN'T LAST VERY LONG."
1,Smudges all over,"It says to shake well, pour small amount of polish onto a clean soft dry cloth and apply to surface. Buff with clean dry for brilliant shine.I have been using a lot of dry cotton soft tshirts. And, no matter what motion, cloth, or effort the entire panel in the fridge is smudgie. From the first application from the bottle onto the surface of the fridge, the cloth comes off black. Then cleaner and cleaner but never shining without all the circles, linear moves . Quite frustrated as I used the spray oil in the past and it was like 2 seconds job."
1,"the volume raises all the way up on its own, do not buy","i have had this stereo for 5 years and the volume would always randomly raise all the way up on its own. the remote was long gone so it is not like i was sitting on the remote to cause it to do that. despite my best efforts to prevent this from happening, i have not been able to fix it. JVC support is unhelpful and they charge way too much to have out of warranty products repaired and they seem to have no interest in solving my problem."
1,Priceless,"4 inch pvc pipe? 5.46, black felt cloth? $1.28, A roll of black gaffers tape $6.32, one tube of fabric glue $3.99. Not paying Canon $900.00 for a lens hood? Priceless!"
1,"Cute, but door falls off!","I bought this toy for my 14 month old daughter because it was so cute. Unfortunately, the door does not stay on and everything falls out. Another friend received one as a gift and had the same problem. I returned it with no problems, but was very disappointed as I had high hopes for this toy. It was cute and seemed like it would be great for taking on visits...oh well."
3,That cursed door!,"My daughter has loved this fairy house since she opened it up, but the door broke within like 5 minutes of taking it out of the box. I superglued it closed so that the house would still look cute and so that the fairies wouldn't fall out, and she was visably sad about the door saying thigs like, ""door no op"" and she looked so confused and bummed out for months. However the snail and his mushroom house and the fairies and their furniture are really cute and now she plays with them (she is 2 now) a lot totally forgetting about the door ever having been able to open. We also have the little people fairy tree house and it is just as fun but it is WAY sturdier. But the fairies all play together and visit eachother's houses and life goes on."
2,"So cute, but fell apart after 1 month","This cottage is adorable and my 2 year old loves fairies, but the door fell off and the entire middle section broke apart after 1 month and she doesn't play roughly. I wish it were better quality. Another iPlay toy that I bought also broke quickly. Cute designs, but the plastic doesn't seem to hold up."
1,Door Falls Off,"The door falls off all the time and is impossible to keep on. It's a kinda cute toy, but my toddler grew bored with it by the 3rd or 4th time she played with it. For the price you should get something your child will come back to again and again."
4,Perfect toy for a toddler girl,"We purchased this toy for our daughter who turned two last May and almost a year later she continues to play with it at least 2-3 times a week. This is a very durable toy with the exception that the pink door sometimes comes off, however its super easy to put it back on. It's so cute and my daughter loves to carry it around by the handle. Great toy!"
4,FUN GAME,My 6yr old daughter & 6yr old neice both have this game & both enjoying playing it. I enjoy playing along with them:)
2,awful toy,"Do not buy this toy for anyone under 8. Most kids think it's polly toys to play with but it's a game. This game is not being used as a game, the dolls are being played with and thrown around. It's a waste of money. Just buy a regular polly toy."
2,not a good choice,My 5 yr old got this game as a christmas gift and we have since returned it. There is no educational matter in this game at all and all you do is move around this little board trying to get a match for your outfit on your card. we found it very boring [...]
5,"Beautiful, solid, exception quality","If you buy the HKS-9 - Satellite Speakers, or the HKTS-18 5.1 Channel Speaker System: USE THESE, they are PERFECT."
5,Attractive and versatile,"Bought 2 sets of these stands for our new Harmon Kardon HKTS 18 surround sound speakers. They are easy to assemble, sturdy and attractive. The cleats on the bottom keep them stable on the carpeting, yet I like the fact that we can still move them a little further out or closer in depending on the number of people we have in the room and where they are sitting.After reading the other reviews, I called Vann's to ask if they were still offering a discount if you were buying 2 sets of stands. They took $10.00 off of each set. I took the chance and ordered them directly from Vann's to get the discount since this wasn't an electronic component and I wasn't in any hurry for them. Usually I prefer to buy through Amazon because their return policy is excellent and I've never had any problems with them. Happily the stands arrived in 3 business days, safely packed and all is well. Thanks Amazon, Vann's and reviewers!"
5,Nice stands and Easy to Assemble,Really attractive stands and easy to assemble. Very stable and hides wiring. I noticed that there was a 25% Savings from Vann's if you buy two pair. I do not know if this will continue. I may have just been lucky. Great for the HKTS 15's or 18's.
4,"Looks good, but expensive and requires not-included hardware.","I paid $90 per set of these stands and while they look great and are easier to put together than hanging the speakers on the wall, they still seemed a bit expensive. I should point out that if you are upgrading from hanging them on the wall, you will need to find the original screws used for the table stands that came attached to the original speakers. The original machine screws are required for installation and a not included with the stands. I found these screws at Lowes for about $5 and got way more than I needed.Overall, they look nice and I didn't have to put holes in the wall so I am happy. It would have been nice for them to include the screws and charge a lower price. I would have liked to pay around $45 for a set."
4,"Good Speaker Holders, but they don't look exactly as advertized with speaker","These are good looking, durable speaker stands. I haven't even used the carpet tacks that came with the stands and they are hard to knock over. I bought them along with one of the specified speakers suggested by Harmon. They are seamless when looking at them straight on, but at side and 3/4 views (pictures that were not available on line) the rear of the speaker is visible. Overall they are great stands and look good. Assembly is a little awkward because the drawings aren't that great. Go to Harmon on line to see better instructions if needed."
5,Undiscovered Master of the Guitar,"John Bruschini explodes onto the scene with his first solo release. This CD features great original compositions, top-notch sidemen, and the extraordinary guitar playing of an undiscovered master. Bruschini's compositions erase the lines between jazz, blues, fusion, funk, and rock. These nine tunes cover an extraordinary spectrum of settings and emotions -- from sweet to soulful; from elegiac to electrifying; from introspective to downright incendiary. This CD has something to appeal to every listener -- beautiful melodies, tight ensemble playing, intelligent arrangements, and best of all, Bruschini's fiery and innovative guitar work. From the intense acoustic jazz of ""As You Were,"" to the high-energy fusion of ""Bloodroot,"" to the deep blues of ""Way Down,"" to the heartbreaking beauty of ""Sarah's,"" this CD contains a dazzling array of delights. Keep your eye (and your ear) on Bruschini -- he's the real thing!"
3,Good for first timer,"This is my first of two yoga DVDs. I was a bit concerned that since it wasn't labeled ""novice"" that I'd have trouble, but that is not the case. The background is beautiful (looks like Sedona, AZ to me) and the production quality is top notch. I like Suzanne Deason's style. The DVD has 4 different women and you follow the one that matches your ability level. I like this because I feel I won't outgrow the DVD too quickly. I don't like the title of the DVD. I like doing yoga for flexibility. This DVD is not for weight loss. If you buy it for that sole purpose you will be disappointed. This is just once piece of a healthly lifestyle. Even Deason says the actual moves aren't for weight loss...but that understanding your body better will help you control your weight. Overall, I would buy this DVD again."
1,Too complicated to easily use,This DVD was a disappointment. They tried to make it accessible to users of many different levels and in my opinion they made it difficult to use. They actually recommend that you watch it first before using it. I wanted to work out - not watch a work out DVD. Go for Rodney Yee instead for a good (but slow) yoga workout
5,four levels,"This video shows four women engaged in the practice at different levels. No matter what your current stage of ability, you can follow one of them. If you don't have time for the entire program, it is broken into three sections."
5,Love It!,I have used this dvd in the past and lost it....Now I have found it on Amazon and it is just as amazing as it ever was. It is a full yoga workout that causes you to loose weight and gain control in your core and other muscles. It tones and tightens and increases flexibility :)
4,Good low impact exercise for the over weight person to begin a fitness program,"I do this work out on the days I can't get to my aerobics class or run and it always makes me feel better. More alive, and calm. I recommend it for those overweight people needing to start an exercise program but too embarrassed and heavy to go to a class. It's low impact and private and very beneficial. This combined with diet could help you get to the place where you can do more high impact exercises."
4,"Excellent, with a reservation","This video is excellent in almost every respect. Suzanne Deason is a terrific instructor, and the use of three students to show variations of the poses, including variations using blocks and a strap, is very helpful. I would give this video five stars easily if the theme of presenting variations was carried through consistently. For example, when the instructor is on her back demonstrating a twisting pose with the knees bent, the students are doing exactly the same thing and there is no explanation of how the less flexible student who can't do the pose as shown, meaning ME, can perform a suitable variation. The omission is all the more glaring because most of the rest of the time the variations are shown and clearly explained. With this caveat, however, I'd recommend this video to anyone who wants a well-balanced 45-50 minute yoga workout."
2,WARNING...May Cause Drowsiness,"If I could return this DVD I would. I am a 26-year-old female who has been practicing Yoga several times a week for about 2 years. I was looking for a program that would at least make me sweat a little- and this is NOT it. I would recommend this for inflexible women over 40 and beginners only. Maybe not even beginners. I wouldn't want this program to be your initial impression of what yoga is or can be. I suggest Living Arts Total Body Workout- with individual Abs, Lower Body & Upper Body segments. I purchased Suzanne Deason's Yoga for Weight Loss because she is an instructor on my other DVD- but this is definitely not for the young and active.The scenery is beautiful, but the music is more of a lullaby. I found myself yawning several times during the seemingly endless 45-minute program. My suggestion: if you can touch your toes then PASS on this one."
4,Good for beginners,"I've only been doing yoga for about four months, so this has been a good DVD to work on basic moves and stretching at home. I found her instruction to be helpful and applicable to the poses. There are reminders throughout on how to breathe and when. If you hit the Angle button on your DVD remote you can change which person you follow; each person on the screen is doing a different level of modification. The only extras you might need is if you do one of the more modified versions which suggest using a yoga brick and a strap. The instructor has alternative options if you don't have either of those items."
5,favorite yoga dvd,"when i bought this dvd i fell in love with yoga, this is my favorite(yoga)dvd. try it you'll feel the same."
4,VERY GOOD!,This program is very good. There are three different levels that you can choose from to workout to. You can start out at the low level and then move up to the harder levels. Very good workout.
3,Not a workout,"This DVD is not a ""workout"" as you might think, with the ""weight loss"" part in the title, but it's a great relaxing yoga DVD"
2,Yoga not for weight loss,"This title is completely misleading, and this video does not feature anything especially arduous--that anyone would think would lead to weight loss (per se).It is a decent beginners yoga DVD, that's it."
5,"Unfortunate Title, Great DVD","I'm just finishing up an eight-session introduction to yoga. Since money is an issue, I decided to continue my yoga practice at home rather than at a studio. I searched for a good DVD to follow.After a lot of on-line research, I selected this as my first DVD. I wasn't disappointed -- this is a great DVD for me. I'm 62 and not overweight. Does it include any advanced work? No. Does it emphasize weight loss? No. Does it give an excellent yoga session, from beginning warm-up and breathing exercises, move on to an active yoga session, then finishes with a cool-down session including relaxation? Yes. It also includes additional backup material to assist the student.Will this be my last yoga DVD? No, but for now it's perfect."
4,Have MS but fitness freak anyway,"I love this workout! I have MS, and Yoga is terrific for stress control and strength building. You can do this video in the Air Condioning to stay cool. My legs got so much stronger after several weeks of this video. It's not easy to support your body weight and hold it for 45 seconds---You can do it!!!"
3,It could be better,I really enjoyed this DVD.It made me sweat when I reached to the full workout however I wish they include more variations of actual yoga movements. Or I expected more levels of difficulties. But it did help me to gain flexibility and strength back after 15 years of non active life since I quit ballet.
2,Weight loss?!?,"Yes, this is a great video for yoga beginners, but never does it get challenging enough for weight loss! It seemed merely a stretching workout to me."
2,Yoga yourself to sleep,"I bought this Yoga DVD expecting great things and was sorely disappointed. If you are a beginner please don't buy this - it will surely turn you off Yoga as it is slow, boring and tedious. Luckily I was feeling a little flush when I ordered this and I ordered another Yoga DVD at the same time which is wonderful - I love it. It is The Perfect Yoga Workout from the Crunch studios. When it says fat burning it means it. Definitely more value for money than this one!"
2,Disappointing..and boring,"This work out was a pure disappointment. I do not see how any weight loss would occur with this slow paced dvd. In the yoga class I took at school I was sweating and my muscles were burning. I became more flexible and relaxed. However, with this dvd I felt nothing. In addition, the dvd menu is quite confusing."
1,yawnga,"I had the same problem that a lot of others have had with this disc. Tooooo sloooowwww. I understand Yoga isn't supposed to be aerobics, a good part of it is breathing and finding that zen, but it shouldn't put you to sleep at the same time. I netflixed this, to see if it was something I wanted to buy, and I'm very happy about that. If you've never done Yoga or it's just still very very new to you then this might be your disc. If however you've attended a few classes or even worked out to 'Inhale' on O in the morning, then this isn't for you. You've already passed the level of fitness this disc caters to."
2,"maybe for a couple of pounds, not for the very large","I understand that i may have missed out, but as an absolute beginner, and someone who is very overweight (over 100 pounds, i admit it) I was only able to make it about 15 minutes through the workout. I found that there was little explanation of what was going on, and often, by the time i could see what i was supposed to do, they had already moved on to the next position. also i found that certain body imperfections made it near impossible to do some of the poses correctly, even on the beginner level."
2,Not for weight loss,"This DVD is fine for beginners who would like some stretching, but there is no weight loss aspect to it. I felt deceived by a cheap marketing ploy that appealed to my desire to lose weight."
3,Shameless advertizing,"It's a good yoga workout, it works well to balance and stretch all muscles, especially lower body and the legs. I feel good after the workout, but after doing it three times a year for a year I have yet to lose an ounce or drop a size. If you just want a good yoga, this is good. But it ennoys me that every time I put the dvd on - every single time for a year now - I have to endure several minutes of advertizing. It cannot be skipped or turned off. Very frustrating practice. It seems to be Gaiam's business model, though. I just started using their Pilates DVD and that too is loaded with advertizing you need to endure before you can get to the main menu."
4,Great practice even for overweight people,"I really like this practice. It is only 45 minutes long, has good modification choices, and I like Suzanne Deason's instruction and voice. I began doing this DVD in January three times a week, weighing 224 lbs & had a little trouble, solved by practicing with the full modification option. Now, I can go along with Deason herself, & I rotate this out with the strength & flexiblity portions of the Yoga Conditioning for Athletes DVD (also good!), and Rodney Yee's Power Burn. Plus, every morning I either do A.M Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss or the more gentle A.M Yoga, all from Gaiam. I just like Deason & Yee a lot. I've never felt better."
2,Yawn...,"I bought this DVD believing by the title that it was going to be a fast-paced yoga workout that left my muscles screaming in pleasure/pain by the end. Not so. I was bored to tears, and I'm no yoga expert - I'd say that I'm moderately skilled at yoga. Anyone who is new to yoga and wants a calming, S-L-O-W workout - this one's for you."
1,This workout video ...not... for non-beginners!,"I have been doing yoga for a few months now at a yoga center. I wanted to be able to practice yoga at home as well, so I bought this video. It was a horrible workout that had little variety in terms of yoga movements. If you are interested in getting a varied workout that will allow you to break a sweat, this video is not it."
2,Poor DVD format,"A good work out in theory, but trying to put four different instructors on one DVD means the DVD keeps skipping, you constantly have to pick up the remote to get back to the position you were in.The positions are okay - but again they concentrate too much on giving you too many modifications rather than really explaining the stretches and breathing. Gets boring after a few times.Overall this DVD has focused too much on being interactive and giving too many choices - it messes up the format and takes away from the actual yoga."
2,Yet More Technical Difficulties....,"As with several other reviewers, I cannot access the Personal Instructor feature on my DVD player...it's a reasonably new and popular model, and I have never had any problem with any other DVD...extremely disappointing...UPDATE: I contacted Gaiam & they promptly send me a replacement DVD (that's the good news)...the bad news: it still doesn't work on my DVD player (a Toshiba). So be warned: All the bells & whistles won't necessarily function as advertised, and that significantly reduces the value of this DVD."
2,Too SLOW,Very beginner. Slow as can be. If you are just starting Yoga let this be your instructional DVD.NOT FOR THE EXPERIENCED.
4,Yoga Video,Very good yoga workout video. I really appreciate the different levels of ability for the various positions. Video can be used by all.
1,Dissatisfied - Wrong product,"This DVD came wrongThe contents of this one is not Madeleine and Suzanne DeasonThe cover is of Suzanne and design of the DVD too, not pore'mo content.We were dissatisfied with the error. I could not make claims on the site for its replacement."
2,Conditioning for the drasticly over-weight.,"This DVD works well for the very very heavy or those with no physical condition what so ever. When I read the title I assumed that there was some level of ""conditioning"" or real physical exertion. I was mislead. I was looking for something that I could use to cross-train with my running and weight lifting and to help me lose a few pounds. In my opinion, Its a 45 minute stretching session with no real ""conditioning"" for those who already have some level of fitness."
5,Great for beginners!,"This video is great. The instructor is very good at describing the things you should be thinking about when practicing, and her voice soothes and encourages. There are 3 examples of modifications so you can work up to the full poses, and the music enhances the experience. I was very comfortable the whole time in knowing that I was doing it right. Some instructors leave me wondering, but she did not. Her cues for breathing were ever-present, yet not overbearing or annoying. The video is visually pleasing and is a pleasure to do.I bought 5 tapes when I first started yoga (not long ago), and this is my favorite. After I watched Yoga for Dummies (which I also enjoyed as a great intro, but had no room for improvement), I was ready to go with this one. I have only done it about 5 times and I am already improving. It's a great yoga video for beginners, and probably for more advanced viewers as well."
5,I love this 45-minute session,"Out of all of the DVD's for yoga that I own and have tried many, many times, this is the disc I come back to time and again.The 45 minutes go by much quicker than you can imagine. The instruction does not get tiring to listen to over and over.I always do the complete workout, but it's great to review the alternative positions so that you know you have choices.I thought this disc was discontinued, but glad to see it's still around."
4,4 levels of workout,"This is the first yoga DVD I've bought. The DVD menu allows you to choose from 4 different levels of workout from beginner to advanced. This was really great for me because I'm very inflexible and need to use props. You can also choose just to focus on the person doing your level or see all four people at the same time. There were also spots in the practice where you could switch to an in-studio comment about how to do the pose properly.The workout is divided into 3 sections and is about 40 mins long, I think. Afterwards, I felt good, warm and stretched out. I'll be using this one regularly."
3,"It's alright, nothing to rave about","The various levels of performance make this video one which is suitable for a wide range of flexibility. I enjoyed the beautiful Arizona surroundings. However, I felt that this tape moved very slowly. While a gentle yoga workout is my preference, I agree with the other reviewers who stated the words ""for weight loss"" seem to be present only for the purpose of eliciting sales. I did not hear any information substantiating the ""conditioning for weight loss"" that the title professes."
5,I love this tape,"I bought this tape about 3 weeks ago. I am very tight in the upper body and hips. Having practiced yoga off and on for about 3 years, I still find this tape terrific. Another reviewer said the twisting poses did nothing for them, but I have exactly the opposite opinion. They are my favorite part of the workout. I also have carpal tunnel and the poses in this tape do not aggravate it as some others do. This isn't for people who are looking to break a sweat, but for anyone who has tight muscles or who just wants a somewhat challenging yet relaxing yoga workout I highly recommend this one."
4,Gentle Practice,I love Susan Deason. She is in excellent shape for her age so truly inspiring.This workout is pretty basic. It may work for weight loss over the VERY long haul. If you are looking for faster weight loss look elsewhere.I actually love Susan Deasons other workouts more. This seems like a marketing gimic by Gaaim. Just a bunch of same old yoga poses with a hopeful name.I do believe yoga can cause weight loss but I am not sure about this particular tape.
2,DVD Skips Then Dies,"While the yoga instruction itself, is great and easy to follow, the DVD itself sucked.The yoga itself has many options for beginner to experienced type levels. It's easy to do even if you're uncoordinated like me. It was fun and relaxing...and if you are a very tense individual who has trouble relaxing, this may just help out.HOWEVER, the DVD stopped working about 3-8 minutes into the actual instruction. There were no scratches on the DVD before or after I opened the package. It just stopped. It skipped then froze all together.The reason I know the workout is great, is because I bought another copy from Walgreens. Hit up your local drug store or target, many other reviews note that the DVD itself is crap."
4,yoga and weight loss,"my daughter used to watch it once only, but she like the programm a lot. there are a few levels, starting from beginner, so everyone can find something useful in that particular DVD."
2,misleading...,"I consider myself to be a beginner when it comes to yoga practice and this workout was not challenging in terms of building fitness. I take a beginner yoga class 2x a week and this dvd is not as challenging as that. There are modified sun salutations and downward dog poses and it just isn't as gratifying as I'd hoped it to be. However, that is not to say that it doesn't offer flexibility and stretching, central components of yoga practice. This would be good for someone who is not at all familiar with yoga moves and is possibly not in great shape. With a variety of modified workouts to follow, it does take special care to address the users comfort level. It simply is not a tool for weight loss."
4,Good DVD for all levels,"This is my first Yoga DVD and also my first time doing Yoga. I found this DVD a good one for all levels. For beginners like me, I can follow one of the instructor, if I improve a bit, I can then follow another. There are a total of 4 levels and it takes me abt 45 mins. to finish a workout. Easy to follow, great sweat and refreshing.Only thing is that I do not have those pops, like bricks and strips."
2,DVD doesn't work,Please be warned - this DVD did not work on my DVD player or other players of the same make. Which is a shame really because it looks like a good workout...
2,Good for beginners maybe,I practice yoga with a local studio twice a week. I bought this video because it sounded like something interesting I could do at home. I was very disappointed. The pace of this yoga video was just too slow for my taste. I don't see how you could be expected to lose weight while doing this DVD. It didn't get my heart rate up at all.
4,Perfect for ABCs,"It's easy to follow. But it's way too easy for some people. So, if you've taken yoga class more than one month you'd better buy any yoga DVD other than this. BTW the reason I'm writing here is that a proper diet should be accompanied with practicing yoga in the first place. You should be much more careful if you do yoga to lose some weights. Even I found that it's hard to concentrate on yoga whenever I overate or ate improper foods like highly processed stuffs."
2,Beginners Only,"This was definitely a disappointment. I figured that the 4 modified levels would offer me a challenge. I did the unmodified level the entire time, and it was still a beginner level session. And don't let the title fool you. The part ""For Weight Loss"" is only serving to feed into the weight loss industry."
3,Some good and bad features,"I've done this DVD workout a few times, and all in all it's not a bad routine. I usually skip through much of the first part where she gives breathing instruction because it is just painfully slow. The conditioning part of the workout is actually not bad, and as many others have mentioned the ability to see the workout modified for your level is a fantastic addition. Overall though, I enjoy Alan Finger's Yoga Zone workouts much more than Suzanne Deason. I feel he gives much better instruction, and provides superior guidance on each section of his programs. I also do not care for the new age style comments she uses throughout the routine. I love Yoga for the physical and relaxation aspects, but don't care for the ""whole being"" comments so much. I do also like that the other participants in the video are real women with normal bodies, and not totally buff supermodels as you often see in exercise videos."
3,Good beginner yoga dvd- not for weight loss,"What this DVD is not:This DVD is a very very poor choice for weight loss. Many Power Yoga, Ashtanga Yoga, Vinyasa Yoga or cardio DVDs will help one lose weight, while this DVD won't do much. The pace is very slow and relaxed and the heart rate never goes up much above a very slow walk.What this DVD is:Although not good for weight loss, this DVD is an EXCELLENT way for someone to begin yoga. The pace is relaxed and they don't do any of the difficult poses such as the Wheel or Headstand. The DVD has 4 different levels and shows beginners how to achieve the same benifits using modifications with yoga props. As one progresses and gains flexibility, one needs to use fewer and fewer of the props. Eventually one will probably be able to do most, if not all of the poses without any modifications."
4,Yoga,Very good that it has different options for level of skills. Weight loss is problematical without more arobic conditioning & diet.
2,Not for weight loss,"This DVD is titled ""Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss,"" yet the instructor states in the introduction that she's never had a weight problem. So why is she teaching this routine? I found her to be very annoying. Further, the DVD formatting is really strange, where you can pick between 1/2 modified, fully modified, etc. There are just too many choices, and this makes the DVD 4 hours and 20 minutes, but it's the same routine about 4 different ways. On the other hand, I tried crunch yoga (Joy of Yoga, and Fat Burning Yoga) and really enjoyed both."
1,Defective disk -- don't bother with this one,Do not waste your time ordering this product. It is defective. I am not the only one who has written about getting a defective disk. It will only frustrate you. Never buying from Gaiam again.
5,Excellent for Beginners,"I love this video. The pace is slow enough for you to get into the poses and feel the benefits, yet, not so slow as to be boring or a burden. The instruction is precise, the instructor's voice is pleasant, and, there are 4 women showing 4 different levels of proficiency. Don't be misled by the weight loss title, this is an excellent overall workout. As a beginner, I find this video to be doable and enjoyable."
2,Not very Conditioning or for Weight Loss -,"I also bought this DVD for the words ""weight loss"" and ""conditioning"". I am a novice at Yoga, and own 2 Yoga tapes. The tapes I own are much better and advanced than this DVD. I have read about Yoga that is a bit more of a workout than just for relaxing, and was hoping this DVD would fit the bill... not so... too easy... not any challenging poses... They should state this is for day 1 beginners. If you have done any Yoga at all this has the great potential to disappoint you as it did me."
4,"good intro to yoga, but you won't lose any weight","If you want to lose weight, go with one of the Rodney Yee videos.The weight loss advertised here is pure marketing."
2,Only good if you are an absolute beginner,"I am not experienced in Yoga. Although I work out regularly, I have only attended about 8 yoga classes and I only started about 9 months ago. Therefore, I assumed that I was a beginner. However, I would say that this DVD is only for people who have NEVER been to a yoga class and probably have not exercised much at all. Overall, I found the program pleasant and they did have some good tips and reminders within the workout, however, I did not get a good workout--just a good mid-day stretch."
4,Nice Workout,"I have taken yoga classes and have a few tapes as well. This is my favorite taped workout. It's a nice balance of relaxation and working the muscles. If you are a true beginner, I would take a class to get the basic principles first. However, if you have had some exposure, but are still a beginner/intermediate this is a good DVD for you. I like the instructor, and like the fact that there are 3 other variations (with realistic-looking women, I might add). The combined workout is my favorite: it shows all versions at once (the instructor and 3 other modifications), and is good if you can do some of the poses fully, but have a few that still challenge you. By showing you each modification, the DVD demonstrates how you can step it down but still keep a correct position."
5,Great for beginners,"I bought this DVD when I didn't have much experience with yoga and it was a great place to start. It has four different women (who actually look like real women) doing the workout so you can follow whoever best fits your fitness/flexibility level. You can also select the workout as a full modified, 1/2 modified or 1/4 modified if you wish.The video moves at a nice slow pace and the poses are explained well so you never have to worry about ""keeping up"" like in some videos. It's also presented in three sections- body and breath awareness, active yoga conditioning, and a cool down. It works all parts of the body and stretches the entire body while maintaining focus on breathing. Suzzane's voice is also very soothing to guide you through the exercise.If you are just starting a yoga DVD collection, or looking for a solid, easy to follow routine, this is it!"
4,"Easy routine, effective for weight loss","I was a little disappointed at first that this routine was so easy. It seemed like weight loss should be about strife and sweating. But this video is about stimulating the digestive system and strengthening the core. After doing it a few more times, it proved effective in getting the digestive system working better. It is really easy, but one can modify moves as per experience level. Recommended."
4,great for beginners,"I did this tape reluctantly at first, being a total beginner and out of shape. Forunately it is slow and simple, easy for beginners to follow along. The other instructors modify the poses for those who have stiff shoulders, not so good balance or who are not very flexible. It's great for total beginners, nice scenery too.However, after a few times it didn't challenge me. The last time I did the tape I nearly dozed off, the mellow music and slow relaxing poses made me sleepy.But if you have never tried yoga and need a slow and easy start this may be the tape for you. The instructors are normal looking women, not intimidating super muscular twenty year olds. I found myself thinking if these women can do it, so can I."
3,Technical Difficulties,"I love Susan Deason's verbal pose cues and commands. However, I was very frustrated that I could not access the Personal Instructor Feature on this DVD. When I saw that logo in the bottom right hand corner, I pressed ""enter"" (as the instructions direct you) to no avail. Next, I tried every button on my DVD remote - to no avail.I emailed Gaiam about this 4 days ago and have not yet received a reply. That truly does NOT impress me.Buyer beware with this video!"
4,I love this DVD,"I have been using this DVD for over a year (I wish I could find something as good). The features are excellent. I would recommend it for someone at least familiar with yoga postures. I do agree with another reviewer, the voice over is not very soothing."
3,"Great for beginners, but otherwise pretty boring","I actually started my yoga practice several years ago with this video, and at the time I didn't mind it. Then I started taking yoga classes with an instructor and realized how unchallenging this video was. If you ever plan on advancing at all, this isn't the video for you. But if you're just starting out, or are overweight (as I was at the time), or even if you're just scared to do more challenging yoga, it's not a bad start. I can't really say that it helps you lose weight though. I actually didn't start losing weight until I started a more challenging exercise routine, which includes yoga and lots of other exercise."
1,painstakingly slow [and boring],"i have only been going to yoga class for a couple of months, so when i decided to buy a yoga tape to practice at home i thought i should get a beginners tape. unfortunately this video is not what i was looking for.the set and music are nice, and the multi-angle feature is fantastic. the actual routine however, was disappointing. i didn't even break a sweat! it's excruciatingly gentle and much too short. i kept waiting for the pace to pick up or for the poses to get harder, but it never happened.i am not in the greatest of shapes myself and have just recently started to excercise regularly and still after finishing the routine i was ready for more. i think this video might be good for people who are overweight, much older, or who have NEVER exercised at all. otherwise, it's just a really long warm-up."
4,Fun and made me feel grate,The thing I love is that it is go at your own pase they show you four diffrent ways to do things with how flexible you are how tight your muscels are and how to breath good and also what you want to loose weight or get stronger or both.
1,This is terrible.what happened to REAL Yoga?,"Why this woman starts yoga sitting on her legs is beyond me.I did Yoga in my younger years and did it at the Integral Yoga Institute and went away from the practice for 20 years. If this woman's DVD is the new market of Yoga, it is a shame. This is her version, it stinks and is almost impossible fora 50 year old out of shape body to do, much less lose weight by. Especially by starting sitting on your legs. How absurd, what a waste of money."
4,Good Phone System,"I have had these phones for over four years and they are on their last leg. I'm sure I may be able to hold on to them for a little longer if I buy new batteries. When I go to answer the phone when its not fully charged it displays ""please wait"" and it won't let me answer. Then I run all over the house to find another phone! I'm sure it's a funny sight! But, other then the fact that the life of this phone seems to only last 2-3 years all the futures are pretty awesome. You can pick songs for different numbers so you know who's calling and the intercom system is really cool...you don't have to yell or run up and down stairs to talk to someone at the other end of the house. The sound quality I find good, it has speaker phone too and the person on the other end can hear you clearly. so, all in all I think this is a really good phone!!"
2,Gettysburg,Was a good radio program To listen to I was a little disappointed because I thought I was buying a documentary of the battle of Gettysburg. Not a play.
4,Electric eel shock rule,i really enjoy listening to this bands music. Rockand roll can rescue the world is a particlarly fine song. This band is so full of energy u just wanna shout when u hear their music.!
1,Lemon,"Bought 2 of these. One didn't work. Sent it back. The replacement one didn't work, so I sent that one back. The second replacement one had a dent in the area of the motor, but wasn't about to care at that point. 3 months later that motor doesn't work. Rarely used, so not sure why the motor is not working. The one we got that works is fun, but I feel ripped off for the other scooter."
3,Good but not great,"I bought this product to commute to work. I read the specs and the reviews and decided to try it. I am under the weight limit by 20-30 lbs but it cannot climb more than about a 5% incline. One of the motors burned out the 3rd day I had it. The support people were very good and they sent me a new motor under warranty that seems better, but it hasn't been 3 days yet. Kids love it and they can ride it up steeper hills."
1,"it's not a real product ,everybody bein asked about it , I am the only one who got that thing in my city.","everybody is asking me about that scooter trx I can't refer anyone to buy that scooter the sale me a defective scooter ,some finding very cool and asked where to buy I don't nothing."
3,"need to fill order or refund, waiting on office products to make good","Sage Collection Mediumweight Paper Plates, 9"" Diameter, 125/Pack, 4 Packs/Carton DXSUX9SAGEOnly received one pack of 25, sent to daughter, still waiting for office supplies to make good on order or refund??? Cause the ad stated 4 of 4pack of total 500. thank you"
3,pink camo's for granny,"It was written that I should order one size larger, but I couldn't imagine this size not fitting. I probably shouldn't have ordered at all because I think they may be Jr.'s.....not misses."
5,"SIMPATICO, the best play ever written","Sam Shepard's SIMPATICO is by far the best play ever written. Gripping dialogue, suspense, romance, intrigue, comic relief, deciet, lost love, and turmoil fill the pages of this play with unstoppable reading pleasure!When Vinnie calls his best friend, Lyle, down to his down-and-out home in Cucumonga California, they start discussing a conflict which has been unresolved for over twenty years now. My favorite scene is when Rosie Carter, Lyle's wife and Vinnie's old girlfriend, comes in. She has the most important character, and her eleventh-hour performance is remarkable and simply powerful. Rosie is the tragic beauty that makes this play stand out.About the movie SIMPATICO, possibly one of the best pictures of all time. Nick Nolte, Jeff Bridges, and Sharon Stone. Stone shines above all as the beautiful, tragic Rosie.READ IT!"
4,FATS AND SOME HEP CATS,"Anyone who has been to the Jazz Fest will appreciate the vibes this DVD creates. The party atmosphere definately comes through. The crowd is mostly ""boomers"" but there are some younger faces too. The video and audio are very good. I reduced the rating by one star for the ""tailing off"" of quite a few songs into the interviews. Also, Fats has a habit of turning away from the microphone on the last two or three words of the song. Fats has still got it and the accompanying 4 man horn section really adds punch. This is how it should be done. Enjoy!!!"
5,Hitachi NR90AC3 Great Nailer,"Great Nailer, a little heavy but nicely balanced. I have been using this nailer about three months @ 10 hrs a day without any problem whatsoever. For heavy use, I recommend putting an automatic oiler in your air-line as that makes the tool perform much better than having to add a few occassional drops.The manual states that the minimum nail size is 2-3/8 (ca 8d); though the factory literature and on-line advertising says that the minimum is 2"". I am using 8d nails, so I am not sure about the lower limit. However, for those wanting to use nails smaller than 8d, I would recommend talking to an experieced retailer about the product capabilities. It is not an inexpensive tool, so make sure it does what you want."
3,Doesn't shoot all nails,"We Purchased the NR90HitachiAC3 because we liked the Hitachi83 that we had for years, but didn't have an adjustment for the nail depth. They advertise that it shoots nails from 8's to 16's. The bigger nails, it shoots fine with not much kick back. Doesn't jam on them. The 8's are a nightmare. That is the main reason that we bought the gun for the 8's as we wanted to be able to adjust the depth while doing the sheathing for all the required engineering. The nails either jam or the slide slips by the nails. Not just a few times, but every time.If you are buying this gun for shooting 10's or 16's then it is a fine gun. If you want it for nailing the shear walls with 8d's... forget it, it is a waste of time and money."
2,The Nailer Would Not Feed Properly,"This nailer would not feed 16d nails reliably so had to return it. I called Hitachi and they told me the feeder on this unit is larger to accomodate full size 3 1/2 inch nails strips. Since I am using 3 1/4 inch 16d and 8d most of the time, they recommended I buy the NR83AC nailer instead. I wish this information had been in the product details."
5,Excellent Choice,"A great follow-up to the NR90AC2. Durable a,d powerfull. You'll have no problem sinking 3 1/2"" nails into the hardest of woods. A little more money but worth it."
2,Handles the truth recklessly.,"This book is an even more reckless handling of the true facts that occurred on the island of Cyprus between Daskalos and the so-called Erevna than the previous book. The mystical side of Christianity is a very important subject for study. However, this account of Mystical Christianity would have done better to present the facts with a less self-motivated agenda."
1,More New Age Nonsense,"This book meanders through so many tangents with neither rhyme nor reason. Another witless New Age attempt to graft ridiculous Buddhist-reincarnation ideas onto Christianity. Please refer to Hebrews 10:27-28 for a New Testament refutation of reincarnation. For those interested in learning more about Mt. Athos and Eastern Orthodox Christianity, please read ""Orthodox Church"" and ""Orthodox Way"" by Bishop KALLISTOS (Timothy Ware)."
5,A superb account about ongoing spiritual awakening,"read this book a few years ago, and was deeply moved by it. Now after a second reading, I feel even a deeper impact. Markides is very upfront about his doubts, and non-committal attitude to any specific formula, thus preserving a healthy level of skepticism, as he approaches ""unverifiable facts."" He lays out his observations in a very balanced fashion, lets the reader arrive at his own conclusions. Without being preachy or pushy, Markides is forceful and challenging, not allowing readers an easy way out from having to examine long-held but often unexamined assumptions about the human condition. An extraordinary work!"
2,Not his best work,"I am pretty disappointed with this book. To much material on new age non-sense. I suggest Mountain of Silence for all Orthodox readers, very very good book."
4,Charming Film,"Here is a nice surprise, a film that actually makes you feel good. With quirky funny characters and beautiful locations, what's not to fall in love with?Highly enjoyable romantic comedy, so get on the bus and take the tour, you'll be so glad you did."
4,Not a Poopie Cockus!,This movie was refreshing change of pace. Every cast member fit in this movie like a piece of the puzzle. I felt like I was watching a romance novel unfold and it was every bit as entertaining as the read would've been. This role was made for our Main Character. She was splendid and funny and believable. This movie is worth a watch if not a buy. It may well be an add on my Christmas this year.
5,AMAZINGLY CAST!,"Anyone who has ever toured with a group will laugh over this movie! How true, how true! It is funny even if you haven't. Amazingly cast, the story is light-hearted yet touching. I had to have it."
3,Some Charm But...Rent It Before Buying,"Not quite Greek Wedding, this flick has its moments of charm and is at times amusing. However, it feels more like a Lifetime movie than a Hollywood blockbuster. The humor gets annoyingly sexual and predictable. For example, the bad guy in the film gives a t-shirt to someone on the ""opposing side."" The guy puts it on, not knowing what the Greek characters say, and becomes an instant magnet for certain locals. Turns out it was implying he was searching for a boyfriend. The romantic thread is predictable as well. But, that's not to say people aren't going to find it to be an okay and entertaining way to spend an evening, especially if they like the genre and the premise. I'd suggest giving it a Red Box/rental trial before purchasing."
2,Not a Complete Waste of Time,"I thought this was an amusing way to spend an hour and a half. It was by no means the best movie I've ever seen, but I thought it was cute and carried a good message about the priorities in our lives!! The scenery is great and the supporting cast created many laughs amongst my friends and I."
2,"Decent Beginning, Quickly Became Horrible...","My first thought was that this movie had potential and it would be at least decent. The start of the movie was decent but it quickly became what I call a DISNEY movie - corny, predictable, and embarassing to watch and...predictable and corny, oh wait I said that but it deserves to be mentioned twice.Bad movie, horribly disappointing. DISNEY almost Hallmark quality movie. Disney should stick to animated movies, they're much better, just want to add that even though it doesn't relate to this movie."
3,Review,"Movie is cute, but predictable. I saw it just before my trip to Greece. Funny part is that my tour also included Americans, Australians, & others from India, Singapore.I have no additional remarks but amazon requires 20 words."
3,surprisingly entertaining,"I had no intention of watching or liking this movie, but my husband picked it out for us and forced me to watch it (that says something right there, HE wanted to watch it) I stubbornly hated the first 10 minutes or so. The plot is very predictable but the dialogue and characters are funny, surprisingly funny, I would watch this again, and maybe even buy it. Hubby liked it too."
5,This movie is great!,"I enjoyed watching this movie and I suggest that you watch it.Greece is very beautiful, and you get the chance to see some places.5 stars overall"
4,My Life In Ruins,It is a cute movie with just the right amount of comedy and romance. Great for girls night out or date night.
4,A good Grecian romantic comedy,"This movie is one of the most enjoyable romantic comedies I have viewed. The actiing is excellent and the Greece scenery adds to the quality of the DVD.The main theme of the movie is the struggle for a beautiful woman tour guide running a foreign tourist service for the historic Grecian sites. She was finally able to make the needed adjustments to make the tourist company successful, and her clients were able to help her in this regard."
4,Entertaining.....loved the scenery.,"Cute movie. I like Nia Vardalos, she's been entertaining in everything I've seen her in. Though she's not a dramatic actress it's obvious she likes what she does. I recommend the movie if you want something lighthearted and visually inspiring. After living in Greece I can completely relate to some of the issues experienced, it makes me miss it. The movie is predictable, ""gal is uninspired, gal meets guy she can't stand, their differences bring them together, OPA!"" I do intend to buy this once it's available, it's always nice to have a feel good movie around."
4,"So much fun, reminded of my Greece trip!","Nia Vardalos the star of My Big Fat Greek Wedding was incredible in this movie and learned many lessons about love and live with the help of her tour bus driver and a little old man played by Richard Dryfuss.If you haven't been to Greece and have dreamed of going, watch this movie. I needed a good laugh and it delivered. Reminded me of my days working in travel and being an escort along with my husband on a Med cruise.Photography incredible, and secondary characters, amazing which made for a very entertaining movie."
4,Cute Chick Flick,"Very entertaining movie, definitely a chick flick, but the scenery of Greece is fabulous. Having been to the country, I loved it."
1,Bought for Wife for Christmas,"Wife said it was a very poor movie. Heard that they actually visited some of the places, and my wife said that some of the scenes and backgrounds looked rather fake, especially in blue ray. Bought cause we loved BFGW, and hoped this movie would capture just a quarter of the magic that movie had. It fell well short.This is a no buy"
2,....in ruins....,"I wanted to like this movie but it just wasn't all that to me. There was too much CRAP for me to find it worth watching. Nia Vardalos' acting was good as usual but the content was stupid. The main character is told the whole movie she needs to ""BE"" with someone...it will make her feel better. There is a scene where another character is participating in a threesome. This 'chick flick' doesn't qualify for me!'"
2,No big fat greek wedding here,"My Life in Ruins is a mildly watchable romantic comedy, mildly funny and mildly entertaining. The acting is OK. That said, the movie is also somewhat boring and extremely predictable and cliched. Mild spoiler warning: Yes, watch as the shaggy, odd bus driver gradually transforms throughout the movie until he is a sleek, clean shaven, perfectly coiffed, sharply dressed handsome romantic partner by the end. See what I mean by predictable and cliched? Richard Dreyfuss adds a little bit extra to the movie, enough to keep it going, but there are a lot better movies you could spend your precious time watching. This is stricly 2 stars."
1,What??,"Based on other people's reviews, I rented this movie. I couldn't even finish it. It's that bad."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"Was a big fan of MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING and ond of Nia Vardalos, and was expecting something similar. However, I was very disappointed. It is a badly acted and predictable comedy that isn't particularly funny. Even the greek guy doesnt look as hot in the movie as he does in the picture on the cover of the DVD box! Don't bother seeing this movie!"
1,Hackneyed,"Blerg.I love the actress so I was suprised to come across this movie as I didn't even hear that it came out. Now I know why.Awful, totally lacking in real character development even for a romantic comedy and utterly unoriginal."
1,too much sex not enough story -= slow,NOT AT ALL LIKE HER OTHER TWO. THEY WERE FUN AND FUNNY. THIS WAS A YUCK!
5,Last funny movie I've seen since... My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"So isMy Life in Ruinsas funny as the surprise hitMy Big Fat Greek Wedding? Maybe not quite there, but I think it's pretty close. The jokes are funny, but the film is moving as well. Richard Dreyfuss brings a lot to the film, combining comedy with wisdom. As the characters begin to enjoy themselves on the trip to Greece, the viewer will too.Only problem: I wish the DVD had deleted scenes. I'd love to see what was spliced out."
5,"Great Story, Greater Scenery","Let me start by saying that even if you see this movie and do not like the story, the scenery alone is awesome and worth the purchase price. You get to see many tourist areas of Greece without the cost of a plane ticket to go to Greece (although, I definitely would love to be in Greece and see these places in person). I think the story line is great too. Nia Vardalos has certain aspirations and has a different perspective of how she viewed people and just life in general. She was a tourist guide and was simply burned out. With the help of some of the tourists more specifically Richard Dreyfuss, she begins to see life differently. As a result, she had also found love. If you are considering this movie, definitely give it a try. As I mentioned earlier, even if you feel the story was horrible, you will not be disappointed by the scenery."
5,Ruins,I ordered this movie because I like My Big Fat Greek Wedding and I didn't get to see it in theaters. I thought it was funny and enjoyable.
5,Frivolous Fun,"I was looking forward to this movie very much after enjoying My Big Fat Greek Wedding, that is until I read many neutral to negative reviews. I finally gave in and decided to go for it and while this isn't as good as that movie I still found it very enjoyable to watch. There isn't much real depth and the story is pretty cliche but I enjoyed it in all of it's frivolity."
4,My Life in Ruins,"Absolutely love this movie. It is a good light movie, and a great laugh. Beautiful scenery, and a great choice of actors. It's a shame they got the Aussie's wrong but oh well, you can't have everything."
4,Very Enjoyable,"I thoroughly enjoyed this show. I don't watch many movies, but after watching the trailer on this decided to rent it. I really enjoyed it, I laughed out loud. Does it measure up to Big Fat Greek Wedding? Yes I think it did in many ways. I think there are those who think it doesn't, because we weren't familiar with Nia Vardalos in Greek Wedding, we weren't expecting to enjoy it as much as we did, there was more of the surprise factor-if you were looking for that you will be somewhat disappointed.This movie, as Greek Wedding, is full of quirky characters, humor, scenes that will touch your heart and situations almost anyone can relate with. And it added the bonus of a peek into the flavor of Greece almost as if you are there as a tourist.I don't rent many movies and purchase even less, but I think I will buy this one."
4,My Life in Ruins,"Great date movie. Funny! I saw this on a trip to China, you could tell which passengers were watching it because of their laugh out loud response."
3,Romantic Comedy,This is a very cute movie but very predictable. I loved the scenery in Greece and all the ruins were really nice to look at.
3,Great scenery with cardboard characters,"What an unfortunate mix. I give romantic comedies a lot of ""grace"" because I always start by giving them the benefit of the doubt and really want them to be entertaining. I don't analyze them if they make me feel good. Yet I was actually cringing with embarrassment at the stereotypical characters they rolled out for this one. I think I saw Richard Dreyfuss cringing at one point too! The simplistic portrayals of each canned category of tourist were actually offensive at times. Yet seen as a travelogue, the scenery was breathtaking, some of the best ever! Also, it's hard to dislike Nia, and Richard even managed to redeem his character somehow. So see it for the scenery if you can prepare yourself to hang in there with the rest. Three stars are for the scenery, but about 1 1/2 for the rest of the mess."
5,My Life in Ruins.... Perfectly Romantic!,I enjoyed the movie. Great scenery. Cute characters. I loved it![...]
1,My Life In Ruins,I still have not received my purchase and i ordered it on December 6th. This is the absolute worst online transaction I have ever made.
5,Ode to an artist,"Annie Leibovitz's sister has created a memorable documentary honoring the life's work of her older sister. We learn about Ms. Leibovitz's early beginings in photography when she started her career at the ""Rolling Stones"" magazine. Her evolution from rock and roll photographer to a photographer of portraits and later on fashion (when she moved to ""Vanity Fair"" magazine). Documentary is also an honest look and her personal life: her relationship with Susan Sontag, her parents and siblings, her three daughters. For anyone interested in photography as a visual form of art this movie is a real treasure."
5,inspiring,"This is a fascinating look at one of the great photographers of our times, from her time at the Rolling Stone,through her exploration of fashion photography and everything in between. It's so inspiring to see her at work.... so creative, enthusiastic and daring. A must see."
5,Can't stop watching it,"If there is one photographer DVD to get, this one has to be it!! I've always admired Annie's work, and this DVD really shows what goes on behind the scenes of some of her best work."
5,Excellent glimpse into the life of a Great!,This film is a brief show into the world of Annie Leibovitz. It is an interesting glimpse into the life that Annie has lived and the career she has established. I believe Annie is the current greatest American photographer. And her style is absolutely inspiring to anyone who is even slightly intrigued by photography. This film would be excellent for any class or personal use.
4,Lots of Good Information,"If you love Annie's work, this is the definitive DVD for you. The special feature has tons of interviews of people who worked with Annie. You also get to know the process of how Annie approach to her assignments and her way to get her picture."
4,No Vector But Great When Converted,"I must say I am glad that I read the other reviews so that I was prepared when I purchased this item. It is a bit misleading that the CD contains files in EPS format because they act just like a placed image in Illustrator. HOWEVER, with a program like Adobe Streamline, the images are absolutely GORGEOUS. I highly recommend this item along with Streamline. In the end, the quality workmanship of a Dover book is found in this product."
4,Excellent reference,This is an excellent generic Fortran language reference for experienced programmers. Not a tutorial and definitely not for someone just learning programming or for someone looking for specifics of a particular compiler. I give it four stars instead of five only because it would benefit from more code examples - in fact there are almost none. But the language rules are quite completely and concisely described. In combination with the typical compiler User Guide the experienced programmer in any other language will have all he/she needs to know to work in Fortran.
3,cosmetic rejects?,"The weighted balls are fine;however,cosmetics of the balls is not of the highest quality."
4,They are what they say they are,"This is what they say it is. They are good for warming up, and the occasional trick with the mates. They have a little plastic feel to them but they are fun."
1,Not so Great,"I had to have this book for a class. But was very disappointed, this book has numerous typos... which is not a good thing for a keyboarding book. Also the cd with this book is simply transcription dictations. You actually have to use Word or another word processing program. And since that is the case, there is NO instruction about what is being asked to do."
3,a mixed bag,"There are moments of brilliance within, but much of it simply isn't very listener friendly. There's a lot of distorted guitar (which is fine and dandy) but what's lacking is production values and melody. If you already love Giant Sand you need to own this alone for the wonderful & perfect campfire song ""Loving Cup"". But if you're just starting on the band, start elsewhere."
5,Simply Enjoyable,"I greatly enjoyed this book. The characters were so real and deep. The author did an excellent job of weaving the story while reminding us of time past where manners were impeccable, and time was filled with things other than technology, and that people and relationships have always had the same qualities. This book was hard to put down."
2,Inconsistent,"I think I would have liked this book if I had read it when I was 14 or 15. Sweet, dreamy, simplistic. But I am much older and I was struck by the inconsistencies: The young man with turberculosis who hikes around kissing people; the garden 'destroyed by the storm and swamped by the waves' that was completely restored and in full bloom a couple of months later - I lost track of how many black pines these people planted in that garden but it must have looked like a forest; the empty beach with an abandoned plastic shovel (in 1938??). Then there was the secretive, silent, and very private gardener who suddenly talked and talked.I was disappointed in this book."
2,Some minor quibbles,"I enjoyed reading this book for our couples book club. It was an agreable little story, stretched a bit thin. It might do for an initial introduction to life in Japan, but I agree with other reviewers that there are many other more detailed books that do a more interesting job. I usually appreciate books that purport to explore the inner spirit, so I was disappointed that the young protagonist, neither by action nor thought, convinced me of the attraction he had for the two older people. The natural setting, yes, but not the people. The ""crisp, clean writing"" (as advertised on the cover)struck me as merely simple. It worries me that slim books of this sort might pass as spiritual books."
4,A delightful surprise,"This book has been on my shelf for a long time. I don't remember when I got it, but somehow, each time I browse I passed it by, thinking I'd read it. Luckily, I picked it up the other day, and now can't put it down. The characters are lovingly and carefully crafted as is the story. the tale of a young Chinese man who is sent to a small village in Japan to recover. Set in ww2, the tensions between Chinese and Japanese enter into the story, as does love and infidelity. The writer weaves together the angst of illness, personal loss, war, with the lovely moments and relationships that make life joyfill without ever falling into the trap of cliche or false aentiment. I will buy more of Tsukiyama's books, and this time I'll read them right away."
3,"Good Story, Well Written","The story was good and well written. You get attached to the characters as the story develops. However, the ending will leave you hanging."
2,Nothing spectacular,"I love books that have real historical and cultural contexts. I had high hopes for this book, but I felt like it fell flat. The main character was given little personality and because of this lack of character the voice of the story was boring. I also had no idea what a Japanese garden looked like and even though they talked about them all the time, I still don't have a mental picture. I wanted to picture this Japanese town but wasn't given enough details to see it. And all the action of the war at this time was far away and only told on the news which I knew from history classes. The character of Sachi was the best because mystery and sadness consumed her. Other than that, I saw nothing spectacular."
4,Accepting One's Fate,"I found that reading this book had a very calming effect on me. It makes you think about one's place in society, the value of friends and family, what it feels like to be ostracized, and how some people find peace in their lives despite dealing with difficult issues."
4,Gorgeous Prose,"Languish for a while in the Tsukiyama's Japanese garden and you may never want to leave. The serenity created in Matsu's little haven is contradicted by the military domination of the Japanese over the Chinese and the reclusive leper colony struggling for a peaceful existence in a realm beyond that of war. It is to this environment that a young Chinese boy enters into in search of healthier air and soothing salt of the sea . As his body begins healing, his emotions are delicately fractured by all that he learns of war, leprosy, first love, his family secrets, and the servant Matsu - who is truly a master of wisdom, honor, and faith. I wanted to walk through this garden again and again."
5,She skillfully paints a visual portrait of time and place,"Although the book is set in a rural Japanese village during the late 1930's, it still paints a portrait of Japan as it exists today in many rural areas. I was able to feel the places she writes about, to smell the sea, to taste the food, to feel the soft wood as I took a hot bath in the outside garden. It is a poignant, beautifully written story about strength in the face of adversity and an enduring love. I would recommend it to anyone as a book to remember always."
1,Tedious & Unbelievable,It took me a week to get only halfway through a very thin book. I couldn't finish it. Might have been a good short story.
4,The Samurai's Garden,"I agree with Nancy Katz's review, I thought The Samurai's Garden was a book to be savored. It was such a delightful read, it was powerful, yet at the same time slow moving.It was really everyhting all of the other reviewers said it was and more. Read it and discuss it."
5,Best novel I have read in a long time,"This book was a gift and I had it on my bookshelf for years before I decided to pick it up and read a couple of pages. I was so entranced by the book, I savored every page, knowing that it would end too soon. She takes you into another world at another time with characters that you can't help but admire. What a beautifully written book, with an ending that leaves you at peace (even though I had tears in my eyes). I would recommend this book to everyone."
3,samurais garden,This book didn't have a alot of action but keeped the reader interested with complex interpersonal relationships. A good book even though I read it for school.
2,Fleshed-out short story; not at all satisfying,"I loved the first thirty or so pages of this novel because it set the tone for a beautiful story, then went absolutely nowhere. World War II was the background, but other than a few radio reports and letters from home, it had no impact on the story. Other than the narrator's girlfriend's father rejecting him because he is Chinese, race is neglected as a theme when it could have played a much larger role in the story. Leprosy is a good plot twist because it makes us think about outer v. inner beauty. The garden was an excellent symbol of life, but it's difficult to set a 200 page novel around a garden, especially in this novel.I agree with another reviewer who thought this was a short story that some editor thought should become a novel. Tsukiyama should have concentrated on leprosy and the garden, and left the other elements of war and racism out completely, because they were more of a distraction than real issues in the novel."
2,nothing special,"I read ""Women of the Silk"" before reading this book, both for my english classes, and I found both books quite ordinary. In my opinion, Gail Tsukiyama can write successful children books as her level of intelligence and talent is not enough for intelligent and well-read readers. The characters in both novels were extremely flat as they have no flaws, which was unacceptable for a reader who can discriminate good work from bad one. Also Matsu's character was contradicting itself as he suddenly become a very talkative person.Shortly, if you like reading Daniel Steel, you can enjoy this book, too. But if you think your sophistication level is higher, then that's definetely not a good choice for you."
5,A beautiful novel,"This book was wonderful! As a person interested in China and Japan, this was a perfect book to read. It gave insights into both of their cultures, as well as what World War II was really like for the people in those countries. It was a very easy and enjoyable read. Simply a great book!"
5,Mist came gently to my eyes as the book gently ended.,"With anticipation and dread, I rose each morning to read this book before my family woke and I had to prepare for the day ahead. As I opened the page where I had left off the morning before, I knew I would quickly be back in the Japanese village among gentle people who had silent histories I longed to hear. At the same time, however, I knew that to turn each page was to come closer to the end of the book. When that time arrived, the story finished on a gentle note; and tears came to my eyes - tears of joy mixed with tears of sadness. If you like a story that reminds you that there is still the faint scent of ecalyptus in the air if you slow down to savor the experience, this is the book for you. The words are simple and direct and full of beauty. You'll find yourself re-reading passages to keep you in the moment. The book is only 210 pages. I could have read a thousand more."
5,"human voice, great literature","One of my favorite epithets is ""the child is father to the man,"" referring not to the obvious persistence of personality, but to the profound impact of child-rearing on adult character. This is the theme of Gail Tsukiyama's wonderful novel, ""The Samurai's Garden.""The novel tells the story of the relationship that develops between Matsu, a Japanese gardener, and his young Chinese ward, Stephen. Tsukiyama skillfully presents both sides of the story through Stephen's first-person narration.As a bonus, Tsukiyama gives us a beautiful introduction to Japanese culture. From the narrator's Chinese perspective, Japanese ways are at once fascinating and accessible.This is the best novel that I have read in a long while. On every level, it delivers much more than it promises. In its afterglow, I would vote for Gail Tsukiyama as the best author writing in America today."
2,Good premise but disappointing execution,"I was disappointed in this book. Its plot sounds so promising--a Chinese man with tuberculosis recuperating at his father's summer home in Japan, and the relationships he develops there. It seemed that a lot more could have been done with this in the hands of a more talented author. The writing was simple and plain but not artistic, and the characters didn't come across as believable to me. People who had spent their whole lives hiding from the world suddenly spilling their stories to an outsider? The main character was very passive about his own life but quite nosy about others. I am surprised at the number of good reviews this book received."
