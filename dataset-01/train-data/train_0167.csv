5,best book I have bought,"this book saved our sanity! This really works. This book will be my baby shower gift for all new mothers. ALL parents should read this book before bringing their newborns home from the hospital. Also not to mention, it reads very easily."
5,One of my best baby buys!!!!!,"This is the greatest Baby book I've ever read. We discovered that our daughter was colicky and was at our wits end with her constant inconsolable crying. I read this book and started practicing the 5 S's and she is now sleeping much better at night. The best part is, as soon as she starts to cry, we can get her to stop in a matter of minutes!!! I am planning on buying this for all my family and friends who are having babies. I think this is a must have for any new parent with a fussy baby!"
5,Great book,"We purchased this book after trying everything we could think of to get our 4 week old daughter to sleep through the night as well as take naps. We do not believe in the cry it out method, but became so desperate thet we even tried that one night and all three of us ended up crying. The 5 ""S's"" that Dr. Karp speaks of worked instantly with her when it came to crying and also helped with her sleeping. Our daughter now sleeps through the night and barely ever cries. This book was so helpful that I gave it to my girlfriend whose little boy has colick and it quieted him down within 2 days.I plan on giving this book as baby shower presents because I only wish I had read it before the baby was born."
2,All necessary information could be resumed in 2 pages,"While the core information presented in the book is quite interesting and useful, I believe it could have been summarized in two, maximum 10 pages. If the author really wanted to publish a book, he could have added some more information on breastfeeding, or on baby's psychology or anything else. But instead he is just talking about the same things over and over and over....Well, at least I could practice my speed reading skills, skipping pages of unnecessary repetitive information."
3,kindle version is poorly transcribed,"This is a great book7 but the kindle version is horribly transcribed. It is full of errors from the OCR process. It does not seem to have been proofread at all. Amazon needs to fix this and get an update to us. The rate of errors gets worse and worse, making for a difficult and frustrating read."
3,"Could have been an article, not a book","Although I am still pregnant at the moment, I found the information in the book to be interesting and probably useful in the future. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the same information is addressed over and over throughout the book. I could have read a few page article on the 5Ss versus an entire book. I recommend if you can get it very cheap. Otherwise don't pay full price."
5,A Must Have for New Parents,"At 1 month and a half we couldn't breastfeed our baby girl any more so we started with formula ... and that's when all the sleepless nights started we tried everything, from teas to colic drops, and nothing worked, we even read similar books and nothing, we were going crazy until we followed Dr. Karps advice and it worked wonders. All the fuss stopped and now our baby sleeps like an angel!! we cant wait to start reading the Happiest Toddler on the Block so we can be prepared when that time comes!Thank You Dr. Karp"
2,Get the DVD instead,"This book contains the advice you're looking for -- namely, now to calm your newborn -- but it's buried in anecdote after anecdote. If you want a helpful tutorial, skip the book and buy the DVD, which contains actual demonstrations."
3,Good info...but not worth a whole book,"The thesis in the book is excellent - by understanding a baby's needs and how the first few months are really the ""fourth trimester,"" we can learn to use his five-steps to calming a colicky infant.The problem isn't that the advice is bad, because it's excellent and very practical. It's that he just repeats and repeats the same points, occasionally slipping in another nugget of useful info. This should be a 10-page handout, not a book. Heck, I probably could paste in enough directions for you to do this in this comment box, thus saving you from buying the whole book.My advice - check it out from the library or borrow it, because in 20 minutes you'll have figured it out and you you can spend the money on diapers (the need of which cannot be abridged!)."
5,LOVE THIS BOOK!!!,"Hi,Everybody.I Highly Recommended this Book.I am a R.N. with my own Baby Nurse Business,and I THANK Dr.Kharp for His knoledge,because I Apply them daily with my Clients.I also,Educate the Baby Nurses Students, with his DVD.If you need some Tips to Calm your Baby,This is a GREAT way to start.Sincerely,J.R. http://BabyNursesandDoulas.com.THANK YOU."
5,"Excellent Book for even 2nd, 3rd ... time Mommies & Daddies","I got this one before my son was born, my second child after a gap of almost 9 years!Loved it!!! I did not use the pacifier, but did always swaddle my little one, with one of his arms out so he could suck on his thumb if need be. We used the swing until he was 4 months old. The transition to crib was very easy.He is now 2 and I do feel this book has helped a lot."
5,Miraculous!!!,"I agree with the reviewer who gave it 2 stars that you don't really need to watch this DVD more than once...MAYBE twice just to make sure you understand it, and borrowing it is definitely a great way to get the information. However, the information itself in the order in which it is presented and with the techniques given are priceless. It isn't always easy as 1-2-3. You may have to put a little work in to finally get the baby to be calm, but it will work. Keep practicing if it doesn't work right away. It may take a little finesse. It may also calm your baby without putting them to sleep necessarily, but I'd rather hold on to her calm and quiet than nothing at all."
5,Wish I'd had this book for my first child.,"Wonderful tips for soothing a fussy child! My second kid is overall a much more placid personality than my 4 year old, but he still benefits from the ""5 S"" program. The book could have been condensed considerably but this is really a minor complaint. Overall it was great, and I plan to start giving it at baby showers!"
2,Easy read,"Basic, easy to read in short intervals and before bedtime. However, so far, I found it too full of anectodal information and little ""what to do"" advice. I've complemented this with ""Healthy Habits,.."" and hope to have 2 perspectives to make the best decisions once my first baby is born in 5 weeks."
4,"Good, but does not live up to the hype...","The pros: the book is easy to read, is straight-forward, and is practical. The cons: there is a LOT of repitition, the book seems to be more geared to calm babies with colic (the title is a little misleading), it's silly that the author claims one must follow his steps EXACTLY, in order to calm a baby(eg. how to ""properly"" swaddle a baby), and there is too much anthropologically/historically commentary. Overall, it's a good read, but didn't offer anything more than commonsense calming techniques. (Also, the book recommends a very tight swaddle, but modern pediatricians say that tightly swaddling the arms is okay, although one should not swaddle the legs too tightly, so as not to inhibit the muscles around the hips... to allow for proper motor development.)"
5,Wish I had it earlier!,"I have to say that hands down this was the most important book that I have read since I became a mother. I purchased this book when my baby was just 3 months old, and screaming his head off on a nightly basis. I tried EVERYTHING. People told me that he had gas, that he was in pain, that I was eating all the wrong foods, etc; basically stating that I was doing everything wrong! If I would have read this book while I was still pregnant, I would have been able to soothe him quickly and alleviated his crying as soon as it started.Dr Karp has great advice that is easy to follow. I now can stop my baby's crying in MINUTES, whereas it used to drag on for hours. I highly recommend this book to other mothers. This holiday season, I am giving this book to all my friends that are expecting. IT REALLY DOES WORK!!! You have to thoroughly read the method, but I promise, your baby will soon be happy just like mine!!!!"
5,The Happiest Baby on the Block,"I found this was the most helpful book I read while being pregnant and after I had my daughter. The steps it describes to calm your baby REALLY DO WORK! I highly recommend this book to all 1st time moms. I buy it for all my friends, the DVD is fantastic and helpful to see 1st hand how the techniques are done. All my (new mom)friends say they can't thank me enough for the book, it has helped them in some frusterating moments with the babies."
4,baby book,Has helped tremendously with our newborn. Great direction on helping soothe a baby and get a break.
5,Simply Amazing!,"This book is fabulous...what seems so simple and obvious, the five s's are often forgotten by busy or flustered parents in the presence of a crying baby. This book simplifies and emphasizes the most basic skills necessary to calm a crying baby and help it sleep through the night (or anytime). I read this book in the last few weeks before my son was born, he is now 7.5 weeks old and I've been practicing these techniques since the moment he was born. He's been an absolute dream from the very beginning...sleeping through the night from the first week we brought him home. These techniques work!!! You can use them all together, or one, two or three at a time. This book is fabulous!!! It should be required reading for all new parents."
5,Peace!,"This book/video gave us very reliable ways of getting our baby-girl to a place of peace and comfort. It was based on providing ""womb-like"" comforts for baby as she enters this world. Dr. Karp's methods provides concrete tools for caregivers to systematically refer to during fussy and/or transition times. As it is a tool for parents, it is designed for the comfort and mindful nurturing of our sweet new babes in their new and sometimes overwhelming new environment. Our baby sleep 8-10 hours at night at 8 weeks. I just told a friend about the video. She has a 6 week old and her baby was crying/fussy and uncomfortable from 5 -8pm. She called me that night and said it was her first night of peace in 6 weeks. I am giving the book and a good swaddling blanket to all my expecting friends and family!! *K"
3,Hooked on the sleep props,"At first I thought this was my gift from God on how to comfort and calm my extremely fussy and colicky baby... however after 3 months of working this magic that I learned from the book, my baby was hooked on the five S's and I had to wean her off them. My suggestion would be to learn the S's and what they are about, but to really follow ""Happy Sleep Habits, Healthy Child"". That is the only book that really got me the Happiest Baby on the Block that I was anticipating in addition to much needed nighttime sleep and naps."
5,Happiest Baby on the Block:The New Way to Calm and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer,"An informational treasure for new parents, grandparents or anyone caring for a newborn. Research shows babies do not need to cry themselves to sleep. This book gives step-by-step instructions to calm the little one."
5,Happiest Baby on the Block book,"I can only hope this book will help the new ""mommy to be"" with helpful advice on how to raise a happy and healthy baby"
2,Get to the point.,"It was nice learning the 5 S's. even though many already know these, seeing them put into an order was nice. However, I expected to learn something I didn't already know or couldn't google for free. This book didn't offer that. Besides the fact I had to skip a bunch of pages to get to the 'how to' and came to find out there's only one main 'how to' and no other options for different styles or personalities. At least it keeps me from investing in a three hour $75 class on the same subject. I do appreciate it being on Kindle so that I can grab my iPad easily if I need to reshare with husband or caregivers."
3,Nothing worked for me,"Did not work for me. Maybe I didn't understand it but tried everything and nothing worked but to hold and rock my baby without days of sleep. Water, vacuum , feeding, changing, nothing worked"
5,BUY THIS BOOK,If you want your baby to sleep and sleep well...buy this book. Such simple concepts but big results. Buy it!
5,New Mom,"Being new parents, we weren't prepared for the fussy baby that we delivered. After two weeks of endless crying, a friend recommended we buy this book. It worked wonders for our daughter! She is now over two months old and we still swaddle her to allow her to sleep longer and rest more peacefully.I will buy this book for all my friends who are expecting!Thank you Dr. Karp!"
1,"OK advice, but condescending","This book starts out talking about the wisdom of the ""primitive"" peoples of the world - I found that very condescending and hard to get past. The advice given is nothing more than what our pediatrician said to us, and a little common sense mixed in - definitely nothing revolutionary and certainly not worth wading through the stuff about the lost fourth trimester. Frankly, swaddle and cuddle your baby. There. Save yourself the read."
3,Just okay,I got a few good tips from this book but no real plan. The No Cry Sleep Solution is a much better book.
2,Give me some practical info!,"I was given this book when I was in the hospital giving birth at 35 weeks. I thought this book went into far too much detail about the fourth trimester and how other cultures never put their babies down. I basically never put my baby down his first several months and now he doesn't sleep unless he's in my arms. In the western world, where families may live on the other side of the country, the support network isn't available and this method is not practical."
3,Some good ideas!,"While this book had some incredibly helpful ideas, as far as how to calm a newborn and how to get them to sleep, I was offended by some other content in this book. There were many, many references to cavemen and evolution, which I thought very much took away from the truth and beauty of the God-given creation and growth of a baby boy or girl. However, if I am strictly going on the practical ideas contained in the book, they were very good, and I plan on using them as a first time mom. But, as far as other content, and the theories and worldview contained in this book, it was not encouraging."
4,ok,"Received the book in a timely fashion, not in top top condition, but absolutely fine. I am teaching the course & wanted a hardcover book to refer to, not just the paperback provided with the course materials. SO, this one will work."
1,Please!,"Okay...I haven't read this book, but have heard about it from some young mothers. It is my opinion that the book simply states what most mothers just naturally do. Have you ever seen a mother holding a screaming baby without swaying, rocking, bouncing? And of course, it is written by a man, who has never been a mother, and is making a fortune!"
5,a must have,"We purchased the book, but watched the DVD in our pre-labor class at the hospital. The book provides more detailed information than the DVD, but I really did need to see it on the DVD to understand how all five steps worked together. THIS PROCESS REALLY DOES WORK!!! It will amaze you!"
5,This book worked for us!,"We did everything that this book recommended and by baby started sleeping through the night within 3 months (but we co slept). We transitioned her to her own crib at about 14 months and followed with the recommendations.Items we bought for this: noise machine (We preferred the waterfall sounds, we got a portable one from homedics so we could take it anywhere, even in the car!), bouncing vibration seat, swaddle blanket. Our baby didn't take to a pacifier, but you can use on if you want to."
2,Didn't work for my screaming newborn,"This book was highly recommended to us when I was pregnant with my first baby last year. The first day, we brought our precious newborn home and she wouldn't stop screaming we immediately turned to the book for answers. We desperately read the entire thing and tried all of the suggestions, but nothing made a difference; she still screamed unconsolably. It left us feeling even more helpless and frustrated. She was eventually diagnosed with reflux, but even after we got her on Prevacid she was a fussy, screaming baby.There were a few things in the book that gave us hope that our baby wouldn't be this way forever, but that didn't make up for the fact that there was nothing we could do in the meantime to make the nightmare end. She finally started acting more like a ""normal"" baby (sleeping more, less screaming) around 4 months. I'm not sure what we could have done differently, but this book definitely didn't have the answers for us."
3,"Wonderful for the first 3 months, but then the magic ends...","Dr. Karp's book is extraordinary for dealing with newbornes and his advice is sound and such a relief for parents of a new baby. We followed his advice completely, and our baby never cried more than 5 minutes EVER. The problem is that he is now 3 months old and we still have to use Dr. Karp's methods to get him to sleep. We still have to swaddle him or else he won't sleep. The reason I did not give this book 5 stars is b/c Dr. Karp does not tell the reader how to ween their baby off his 5 Ss. He simply says they won't need them, but it is not true in our case. I am now disappointed b/c I think we will need to teach our son how to sleep unswaddled. Bottom line, it is a great book for the first 3 months, but remember the honeymoon is over after 3 months and you will eventually have to deal with unswaddling your baby."
5,It worked for us...,"It's amazing, but this technique really does work. We suffered with an incomplete method before we got this book. We had an out of control, crying baby and nothing seemed to help. My husband and I were at our wit's end, and losing sleep. Then Dr. Karp entered the picture. We had been swaddling our baby, but could never seem to get it right and baby would always get out. We improved our swaddling and added jiggling of our baby and the other techniques and our baby would magically quiet down and eventually go to sleep. Eventually, our baby was sleeping 6 hours straight (and so were we, thank goodness)!I don't think you can go wrong here. Give it a try."
5,Happiest Baby,"This is a very good book for any new parent! I read it, and passed it along to my sisters for their own kids."
5,It can't be this easy,"Dr. Karp's technique is simple and amazingly effective. After the third amazing night, my wife looked at me and said $5 on the Kindle? It was worth $500. Believe me, this is the book you were looking for."
5,GREAT book for new parents,"I ordered The Happiest Baby on the Block for a friend after reading it myself when I had my child. I read a few books in preparation for, and during, those first few months, but this one, I found the most helpful. It addressed so many of the things I was feeling and my baby was going through--and gave me multiple solutions and theories (not just one that may or may not work). I appreciated all the advice while still reminding me that there are some things that you may not figure out, and not to worry, your baby WILL grow out of it! It also had some humor in it, which is so important when you are stressed out in those first few months with a newborn.All in all, it is a GREAT book that I HIGHLY recommend to new parents."
5,Best of the Bunch,"I wish someone had sent us home from the hospital with this book! It's easy to read when you're sleep deprived and makes sense. We were doing all of this already, just not all at once - and that made the difference.Less judgemental than Pantley, less screaming than Ferber - our baby is happy and sleeping and so are we!Buy this one!"
3,Useful information that could've been condensed to one page.,"You can get the same gist on how to calm your baby by reading these reviews and the rest are just fillers! Ofcourse, babies are their own unique person, so not all of the information (if any) in these types of ""cookie cutter"" books will be applicable to all babies. The three things that work best for us out of all the 5 S's are swaddling, sucking, and swaying/rocking/motion. Other than these three soothing methods (which can be Googled), the reassuring tidbit that we got from the book was that newborns NEED/WANT love and affection, so it is important to not deprive them of such simple requests. This alligned with our belief that it is ok to give your newborn the attention, as we do not believe in the ""cry it out"" method or anything along that spectrum for a newborn."
2,not worth buying,"I think people love this method which is fine. I'll probably use it but it's not worth buying to read. I heard there was a dvd. This book should simply be an article because that's the length of real content in the book. I am not a fan of books which constantly repeat the same things over and over again. I kept hoping I would read new things as I continued to read, but it was the same stuff throughout the book. It feels like they decided a certain length of book sells for a certain amount so just keep adding filler to get to that price point."
2,Just OK,"This book contains a lot of filler...things like background stories that really don't have anything to do with solutions for a crying baby. Luckily, the chapters are labeled well so those parts can be skipped. Basically, you're reading one or two pages of real substance per chapter. This book has been made into DVD and is available on Netflix so I'd go that route before buying this book."
2,don't waste your money- get the DVD instead,This book was too confusing. I got the DVD instead and it is worth every penny! The DVD is the best 25 minutes you will spend! It clearly demonstrates the swaddling technique that is not too clear in this book.
5,A must have for parents,"We bought the dvd because we did not find out about this until our baby was 4 weeks old, which was about 4 weeks too late, that is why we bought the dvd first (no time to read), I have oredered the book also, but the dvd is a must have. It is very easy to watch and makes so much sense, and the 5's really do work. We also orderd his swadle blanket and his swaddle me one piece as well as the white noise cd, they all work great and it really has given us more peace at night. It is the best stuff I have bought for my baby."
2,"What happens at 4, 5, 6 months?","I agree with the reviewer who said that the 5 S's worked like a charm for the first three months. I recommended the book to all of my pregnant friends because our baby slept so well and was so easy to soothe. HOWEVER, now our baby is almost 6 months old, and the 5 S's do not work anymore. In the last week, she now takes about 1.5 hours to calm down enough to go to sleep. She screams if I wrap her, and she screams if I unwrap her. Dr. Karp makes the reader feel that all of a sudden at four months, your baby doesn't need a swaddle, can find her thumb and feel secure all on her own. She did seem more like a baby, not like a fetus, at four months, but I really feel she never learned how to self soothe, and the confidence I had when she was a newborn is gone! I really feel like I don't know what I'm doing anymore!!"
2,He should have written a pamphlet,"I'm actually pretty disappointed with this book. The information he presents is good, as far as the steps to soothing a fussy baby. However, I don't think he needed to write a whole book to share that information. Instead, he could have just written a 10-page pamphlet. Most of the book is repetitive and full of stuff that I, as a mom-to-be, couldn't care less about. Seriously, I don't care why ape babies millions of years ago held on to their mothers; just tell me what to do with my baby now. If you want to know the ""secrets"" he offers, look up the youtube videos. You can learn the skills in 5 minutes instead of the hours it takes to read the book. Reading the book is a total waste of time if you're looking for useful information and applicable skills, since most of the pages are filled with fluff."
3,It's like a really great pamphlet,"So The Happiest Baby On The Block is all the rage, and though your grandparents might wonder just what the hell you're doing wrapping your baby up (""let her breathe!"") and swinging her to and fro, people say over and over again that it works. For us, we layer parts and pieces and our beautiful daughter calms down.Here's the thing, though: you don't actually need to buy this book. You need to read it for 15 minutes in a book store, or borrow a friend's book, or find a web site that explains it. The book is 288 pages with maybe five pages of actual information and 283 pages of filler. Not bad filler, and I don't hardly begrudge Dr. Karp for making money while creating less-harried parents, but you can save your money and learn these things another way."
1,Karp gives it a five star but... I don't!,"I read this book cover to cover, not knowing how to deal with my colicky baby. We tried everything and nothing worked. We saw Dr. Karp and he demonstrated his famous shooshing sound while pounding my then 6 month old baby's back real hard. My son looked at him like ""what are you doing to me?"" His suggestion at the end of our appointment was ""Read my book and call me and tell me what you think, will ya? I need to know if I am brilliant or not."" He also thought our son was 6 weeks old (normal healthy well-developed 6 month old!). My husband and I were shocked. We were so unimprssed by both Karp himself and the book! Besides there's nothing new in this book and is extremely poorly written!!"
5,A must for all expectant parents,My daughter is 5 weeks old and I read this and watched the DVD during my pregnancy. You know how people say you can never prepare yourself for parenthood? Well they're wrong...YES YOU CAN with this book! The DVD and book equipped my husband and me with the tools needed to calm our baby and feel confident in ourselves as parents. This is going to be my baby shower gift to every expectant parent I know.
5,This book changed my life!,This book was extremely helpful in calming our 6-week old baby girl. She used to cry for 3 hours every night. But using these techniques really saved our lives. She responded right away and it really worked. We used the technique for many months and found it extremely helpful. Thank you Dr. Karp!
4,A lot of book for a little great advice.,"We bought this book out of desperation of sorts: we were trying to find a way to persuade our infant daughter to sleep a little longer at night and, hopefully, give us a little more sleep. We followed Dr. Karp's advice: swaddling and white noise did the trick! She went from waking every hour and a half to waking every two to three hours. It doesn't sound like much, but every minute more feels amazing.I think this book is a big help to parents in that it gives them some time-tested methods to help soothe their babies. However, once you get past the five Ss (swaddle, side, shhhh, swing, suck), the book doesn't have a lot more to offer. It's full of a lot of anecdotes, most of which include the phrase, ""Dr. Karp is amazing!""That being said, I did appreciate the advice the book had to offer and it was nice to read the words, ""Your baby cries. You're not a bad parent. Here's how to fix it."""
5,Manditory.,"This book should be handed out to every new mom at the hospital. Fantastic detailed information that doesn't leave you hanging. Step aside Hogg, this man is the true baby whisperer.I would highly recommend for all moms, first,second, third....My mom and I read it together while helping my 2nd through his first 3 months. She raised 4 kids, helps with 8 grandkids and was a neonatal nurse for 10 years. She was blown away by his wonderful techniques too.My son would have been labeled colic, but instead I had tools to use and made it through with my sanity. Even if your baby does not have colic, you'll appreciate the techniques at 2am.Thanks Dr. Karp! Now when will he write one about husbands..."
3,Great information- could have been written in 5 pages or fewer- doesn't need a whole book!,"The writing is fairly terrible, and the book is annoyingly (really annoyingly) repetitive. You can get all the information you need in fewer than 5 pages of reading. If this book were edited down to the useful information without repeats- it would be a pamphlet- not a book! And that would be so much more useful, as when you're a new parent brevity and concise information are very helpful in your sleepy stressed-out state. So I'd give it 1 star for writing, for being annoying to read, and for taking too much of my valuable time.That said, the actual content and point of the book is truly amazing. If you take the tips and the main points- IT WILL SAVE YOU. So for the hard content of this book, I'd give 5 stars.This makes an average of 3 stars, which is why I rated it as I did."
3,"Great advice, but get the video instead","Harvey Karp is a genius and his techniques work. However, you won't actually be able to figure out what his techniques are unless you buy the video instead of the book. In this case, a picture is worth a thousand words, and as the parent of a colicky baby you won't have time to read this book and try and figure out exactly what he means by a 'shush' sound."
5,Pure Genius!,"These techniques really work! The only thing I would add is a longer section on how wearing a sling goes right along with this method of comforting. With the sling and this book we are able to comfort our daughter 99% of the time in just minutes! My parenting library is now over 30 books and this is the one I recommend the most to friends.Both of my children would probably have been labled ""colicky"" or ""difficult"" babies and I read this book when I was pregnant with baby #2. I really wish I would have read it before I had baby #1 because it has saved us hours of crying with baby #2 who is actually a more fussy baby than #1 was, though cries much less when we apply the method presented in this book.It is an easy, quick and entertaining read!"
5,"Even if your baby is fussy, rather than colicky, it works","I stumbled upon this book while looking for books on how to get my baby to sleep more hours through the night. I decided to give it a shot, mostly because of the reviews posted here on Amazon. It's the best [money] I've spent! While our son is not colicky (he doesn't scream and cry), he is fussy. His fussiness began at seven weeks- he just seemed unhappy- crying etc. He also had trouble falling asleep- especially during the day. He only would sleep 2-3 hours at night. Now we use the methods described in the book, and it calms him right down. He stops crying and becomes very peaceful and sleeps like the dead (five hours straight last night!) The methods are not difficult and the book is very funny. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a fussy or colicky baby!"
5,The man is a GOD!!,I got this book after my Mom read a review on it. I didn't even read the cover I just bought it. My second child only 3 weeks at the time was cryingat night and would not let me put him down between 8pm till 11pm. My arms were killing me my husband is gone nights. I finshed Dr.Karps book in 2 days and it has saved my life ALL his methods worked for me and I loved that he gives a digram of how to swaddle your baby the right way I can do it with myeyes closed now. This book is a must for first time parents and us seasoned ones as well.
4,Worth readiing,"Good book and definitely worth reading, especially if you have a fussy baby. It didn't ""cure"" our son's colic but offered helpful advice and explanations. Not all of the suggestions helped him, but they were worth trying. The ""Fourth Trimester"" theory makes a lot of sense, and the ""Five S's"" seem to be the standard for calming babies."
2,Follow mothers' instinct and common sense,"Can we stop listening to a men to learn how to raise our infants just because he has a degree? If you are the mother, and you have the hormones and you have your mother instinct? Try to read the excellent books for mothers The Vital Touch. You will totally change your mindThe Vital Touch: How Intimate Contact With Your Baby Leads To Happier, Healthier Development"
2,Half-baked,"The book has some great tips in it. Unfortunately, the author has decide it to wrap his advice in the rather unconvincing idea that evolution has stupidly decided to bring babies into the world before the they are ready to handle it. Swaddling babies is not a new idea and has been successfully practiced in baby care for centuries without the ""fourth trimester"" theory.The author also makes frequent general assertions that ""primitive cultures"" in Africa and Asia possess inherent cultural wisdom that permits them to always treat their babies right. This idea, although complimentary of those ""primitive cultures"" (as he calls them, though with the quotation marks), is inherently racist, and Karp never back up such assertions with actual data or by quoting studies.I wish Dr. Karp would just stick to providing his useful advice and keep his half-baked theories about the fourth trimester and the inherent wisdom of ""primitive cultures"" to himself."
2,same ol' stuff,"this book was very highly recommended to me from all my girlfriends with new babies, but after reading through it, I found it to be just a whole lot of common sense stuff written the same way in many different chapters. The author seemed to try to re-invent the wheel with his theories about colic and reflux and with each chapter, he just repeated himself. Maybe a good book for some, but for me as a first time mom myself, I did not find it to be a ""Bible"" of sorts, as so many others have attested to."
2,Don't waste your money,"Sorry, but this book didn't really have any revolutionary advice, and seems to keep making the same points over and over. Buy Dr. Spock where you get advice on just about everything, instead of wasting your time & money on this one. We didn't find any miracle cures for crying here, and lucky for us, our sweet baby grew out of his crying fits anyway."
2,Repeat Repeat Repeat,"I first saw the author on the Dr. Phil show. I knew I must go buy this book. Honestly, I got most the information in the entire book while seeing him on the show for 5 minutes. The author repeats the same stuff, just altering the wording, over and over and over. I think it does have useful information in it, but it could have been writen in a 30 page book as opposed to how it was writen. I had trouble getting through it just becasue I felt I was waisting my time reading the same stuff for a second, and a third, and a fouth....."
1,Such a Joke,"I can't believe how far this ""Dr."" has gotten with this book! He is such a joke. The stuff he ""teaches"" in this book is all common sense and things that they have been practicing since biblical days. Do we really need a quack to tell us to swaddle and shush, it is so silly it cracks me up. Don't waste your money! Anyway, you can watch the jist of what he does (which is not much) for free on youtube."
2,Not the happiest mom on the block,"Did not love this book. I found myself starting to just skim it because I lost interest after the second chapter. It is very repetitive and for me it was nothing that I hadn't already heard before about soothing a fussy baby. I had twin babies - who I believe both were colicky - and I didn't refer to this book once. I think most of the methods described are common knowledge. Also, there is a lot of talk about the missing ""fourth trimester"" and how mothers in other countries raise babies. To me, it was not relevant. I would suggest using your instinct, talk to other mothers, and do some research online and you will save yourself time and money."
2,Worth the money.,"I feel that this book should be a must read for all new parents. This book has the best advice on how to calm your baby. I appreciate having this book as it works for my daughter. The advice in this book is priceless. It really works. This book is what will turn your ""colicky"" baby into a bundle of joy.[...]"
5,Good book for 1st time parents!,"This is a great book for 1st time parents. Tells you how to calm your baby if your baby cries all the time, there are effective ways to calm him. Reassures you that you aren't a bad parent. Some babies are just fussy. The book does go on a bit I didn't read the whole thing. Who has time? But read enough to help calm baby."
2,Too much fluff,There is some solid advice in this book however it could have been written in a pamphlet. The author uses way too many words and too many examples to prove his point. He makes you read through way too much history to get to the good useful points.
3,Good for first time parents,"The first 3-4 chapters kind of drag, then it FINALLY gets in to the details on how to calm your baby. I bought this book because I'm having my 3rd child, the last one being born almost 8 years ago. I was trying to brush up on my skills but found that this book didn't offer me much of what I didn't already know from trial and error. This is a good book for anyone that thinks letting a baby ""cry it out"" and ""holding your baby too much is spoiling them"". Good arguments on why not to do that."
3,not worth the money,"There is too much repetitiveness in the book. Not worth the money, I wish I could have just borrowed it instead."
4,Helpful,Going to be a new mom soon and I am reading anything and everything. I figure it can't help to learn as much as I can and try to use those tips. This book had an interesting approach with the 4th trimester theory. I was easy to understand and I hope to be able to use some of the tips.
4,Helpful Ideas,"Overall I enjoyed this book. I found that some of the advice was a bit repetitive chapter after chapter, but quite helpful overall."
5,Best book ever for new parents,"I've been in the child care/child raising business for almost 30 years. I discovered this book about a year ago, after reading many, many other books. This is now my hands down favorite book to give new parents. It should be yours too! Fun, easy to read, loaded with really practical advice for new parents. If you are pregnant: buy this book. If you know someone who is pregnant or just gave birth: buy them this book!"
3,Very good solutions to comfort baby,"This was a good book and has a lot of good solutions to comfort baby. The book was recommended to me by my sisters who have tried out these solutions and found them to really work. However, some of the ""chatter"" in the book is kind of far out for my likings, but I just ignored this and gleaned what was useful for me."
4,A sleep saver!,"On our second night of parenthood, when we couldn't get our daughter to stop crying, we opened this book and it became the solution not only to her sleep issues but to ours as a result! The five ""s"" system really worked for us. We regularly give this book to new parents."
4,Five Basics,"The second half of this book has really practical, proven-by-experience advice (five basic strategies for keeping a baby peaceful) for anyone with a newborn baby. The first half, on the other hand, is almost laughable. My recommendation to my daughter was to soak up part two of the book and ignore the first half in the interest of saving time."
2,A good book to skim through,"I think there is some pretty good advice in this book, but I think it could have been written out in a couple pages, maybe a chapter. The rest is a lot of evolution theory, stories, and reiteration. For a solid in depth look at sleep and fussy babies I recommend Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child by Weissbluth"
4,Great book for newborn to 3 months!,"My pediatrician recommended this book to me when I expressed my concern about my (then) 2 week old's night time crying. Once I read the book and saw how simple it could be to calm my baby down, I felt much more competent and was able to put the steps to good use. Now that my baby is 2 months old, and doesn't really enjoy being swaddled anymore, I'll be buying the No-Cry Sleep solution.One thing, this book was VERY wordy and probably could have been a third the size that it is and still gotten the message across."
5,Calming babies,"I suspect that many parents stumble onto the techniques that Dr. Karp has outlined in his book. I learned the technique for snuggling and jiggling my daughter from a friend who had worked for a daycare. It took us several weeks of being unable to reliably comfort her before I put the whole process together in a way that works reliably. It would have been such a relief for all of us to have the whole thing put together at the beginning. I appreciate having a system that works for my daughter, but even more, I value knowing WHY it works.I think that every first parent should learn this technique, whether they learn it from a parent, a pediatrician or Dr. Karp. It will save the sanity of many new parents!"
5,"A Must Have Even If Your Baby Isn't ""Colicky""","After seeing Dr. Karp work his magic on a morning TV talk show, I dedided to buy this book while I was pregnant with our daughter (our first child) -- I wanted to be as prepared as possible should she be a colicky baby. While we were really lucky that our daughter was not a textbook colicky baby, the techniques in this book nontheless helped us to calm her through her fussy period in the early weeks and continue to be useful in keeping her happy, content, and well-rested as she approaches 3-months of age. And who knows -- maybe employing Dr. Karp's techniques preemptively actually prevented some colick. We would certainly recommend this easy to read and use book for any new parents-to-be."
5,Must Read for Everyone. . .,"This simple read book is the ""owners manual"" that everyone has always wanted who care for babies. For new parents it gives them answers and confidence to care for their newborn with down to earth explanations, directions and suggestions. This book is helpful if this if your first baby or you last baby. I give this as a first gift early in a pregnancy so it can be read,studied and discussed by both the mother and father long before the baby arrives. They will enjoy their new baby much more with the techniques and information that they will acquire from reading and studying this book. Others will be asking them for ""advice.""I always keep some on hand for quick giving when a pregnancy is announced. I am always thanked for the special helpful gift."
2,"Eh. It's OK, but...","This book could easily have been half its published length. There are some good tips, but it's very repetitive. After at least six chapters that began and ended by reminding me that a newborn baby is really a ""fetus in its fourth trimester"", I was ready to start screaming uncontrollably myself.Finally, I skipped to the part about how to swaddle, then never referred to the book again. For me, this book was a waste of time. I'd have been better off just Googling ""swaddling"" and downloading the instructions."
3,Not the miracle I thought...,"This book is ok, but it certainly did not turn my newborn into the ""happiest baby on the block"". I was expecting a miracle and did not get it. I think it is interesting that the author says that ""if done correctly"" his techniques will work. Well, I guess I did not do them correctly! The techniques described in this book did not really work for my son (he hated being swaddled!). However, this book did help me understand what the world must be like for a newborn and did provide some soothing mechanisms. Also very helpful is the author's CD of ""womb sounds"" that my son loved until he was about 3 months old.A much better book is ""Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child"" by Marc Weissbluth."
3,Take the Doctor's Advice,"Before you sell yourself on this book, take the doctor's advice and rule out any and all medical causes for the crying. I had almost convinced myself that my newborn was suffering from colic and had my husband run to the store to get this book. I read a few chapters, got a good laugh about the prehistoric connection and decided to call my pediatrician before I was sure that is was colic. And I'm glad I did. My poor baby suffers from reflux (as had two of my three other children). The missing link was my newborn did not vomit or spit up and so I thought it couldn't be reflux and the incessant crying must be colic. Not so - she suffers from silent reflux where the stomach acid comes up the esophagus and then she swallows it back down.So I suggest that you definitely follow the doctors advice and consult your pediatrician to rule out any medical concerns before you sell yourself on the missing trimester!"
5,"Essential ""Bible"" for new parents!","My husband & I are new parents and we wanted to read as much good, scientific, solid advise that we could get our hands on! We saw Dr. Karp on the Dr. Phil Show and immediately purchased this book. His advice is based on years of scientific study, research, and practice. He explains not only his methods but also explains his research in layman's terms.Dr. Karp, a highly experienced and revered pediatrician, gives unbelievable techniques that have worked like a charm with our 6-week-old infant son. Because of the 5 ""S's"", he is a smiley, happy, content baby with minimal fussy periods and, knock on wood, the nights have become a breeze (he wakes us once to feed, and goes back to sleep immediately!) Believe me, the methods are fool-proof if performed correctly.If you read NO OTHER BOOK, you MUST READ THIS ONE!"
5,So Glad I read this!,"We're going to be first time parents shortly and several people recommended this book. I'm glad I read it because it covers things that What to expect didn't cover. It was a fast read. As usual, Amazon had the best price and shipped it to my home within a couple of days. I strongly recommend this for expecting parents!"
5,From a Childbirth Educator,"Great information to the new parent, some of which I plan to include in my childbirth class. Chipman RN"
5,A great baby shower gift,"This book and video are the best gift you can give to first time parents. I recommend the video, since you have so little down time with a newborn and you see examples of the techniques. It is amazing!!"
2,"Works, but methods are not sustainable throughout the day","Like many reviewers have said, this stuff could have filled a pamphlet instead of a whole book. The five S's sometimes work a little to calm my fussy baby, but I can not walk around with a swaddled baby swinging in my arms with white noise following us all day. I suppose if my baby would tolerate the swing, these methods would allow me to eat a meal.The other thing that drives me crazy about this book is the amount of people who ask me if I've read it when they see me and my fussy baby. I've shushed until my teeth were numb, I can swaddle in the dark, and I can't stand anymore without rocking back and forth. Yes, I read the book!"
3,Most definitively does not deserve so much hype!,"I got this book because of the high rating and reviews, it was during the time my newborn was very fussy, as a distressed mother I thought to myself, I NEED THIS BOOK, with that amount of good reviews,it must be one of the best baby books ever! I had to order it.So I anticipated its arrival, and finally the day came. I delved into the book, only to find myself eventually skipping paragraphs, then whole pages, until I was most of the way through, I realized, it was very repetitive.. When I came back on amazon to see the not so good reviews, I wasn't surprised to find people who thought the same things I did, that its really information that can be summed up in a pamphlet.Honestly I don't believe the book deserves the hype, I'm glad its a lifesaver for some people, It did help me to a degree, but I get the impression, this author knew a simple concept, but also wanted to make money, so you get a very long drawn out disappointing book."
4,Wonderful for NEWBORN babies,"This book is a LIFESAVER if your baby is a colicky newborn. There is no other manual for the ideas that calm and soothe a cranky newborn. The ideas are all commonsense and known to mothers since the beginning of time: rocking, swaddling, shhhing and holding your baby - but in today's world lacking family to teach us these things this book is the next best thing. One problem is that when you are outgrowing the methods and you no longer want to rock, swaddle and shhh to sleep several times a night then you have to go the next step and I'd suggest The No-Cry Sleep Solution by Elizabeth Pantley. Dr Karp's work and hers are very compatible and he even wrote the foreword to her new book Gentle Baby Care (which ALSO has great chapters on sleep and crying and colic and teething and swadding) Between these two authors your baby can have a calm, peaceful first year."
5,This book helped a lot!,"We thought our 3 week old liked to flail his arms and wrapping him up was making him cry. Turns out we were just not wrapping him tight enough. This book help us to calm a fussy baby into a manageable baby. He isn't completely over the fussy phase, but it is a LOT better because of this book. The techniques to calm him when he screams work just about every time. We can't get him to sleep much longer, but at least we can get his crying to stop within a minute or two rather than an hour or two. That alone makes this book worth the money."
4,A loving approach to soothe crying,"This book is wonderful in that it offers a loving way to help calm your fussy baby down, where other ""experts"" recommend letting babies ""cry it out,"" saying there is nothing you can do for colic, etc. At 5-months, my daughter still loves to be swaddled at night and has been an 8-hour+ night sleeper since about 4 weeks (when we finally got the swaddling technique down!)However, if you have a chance to see the Happiest Baby video featuring Dr. Karp (we saw it in our ""Baby Care"" prenatal class) and also learn how to swaddle really well, you probably don't need this book. It's pretty lenghty with a lot of examples from parents with fussy babies -- really all you need are the ""5 S's"" and you should find success in calming your baby. Dr. Karp's approach is wonderful and his techniques were highly recommended by the nurses at our hospital."
5,An excellent book for crying babies.,Dr Karp approach is very simple and practical for fussy and crying babies.This is a magic touch to calm crying babies.This is a MUST to read book for all the parents and for the pediatricians to recommend to their patients.His Video showing very clearly the approach and is fun to watch and learn.
3,Might have been better during pregnancy...,"I read this book during the time I was trying to figure out why my baby wouldn't sleep well (or ever!). Turns out she had colic, acid reflux, AND food allergies. I tried all the suggestions in this book but unfortunately they did not help.I do think it would have been more helpful to have read this book while pregnant. Perhaps I would have had a better idea of suggestions and tips from the start... although, in my case, they would not have helped anyway. I found this to be a pretty quick read and have kept it just to reference for the next baby."
3,gosh he talks to much,im half an hour into the book and feel that he hasnt said much. he keeps luring you with his great experience and how he can solve many problems you have with your baby but he hasnt said how half an hour into the show.for me thats hard to read because its really frustrating.
2,Way too repetitive and boring,"The book is repetitive and pointlessly wordy to the point of becoming boring and annoying. I agree with the reviewers who wrote that the entire book content could be summarized in a pamphlet. I didn't like the author's writing style either, but this might be just a matter of taste.I would not recommend this book."
5,DRKARP SAVED US,"Until we used these methods our daughter would cry for hours and we would pass her back and forth. Dr Karp saved us and our daughter miserable hours of crying at night and let us all get some sleep.I want everyone to know that when it is hard to know what to believe with all the different methods and books, this is the winner and it really works.I have been telling everyone I know with a baby to get this book."
3,Decent info...not a page turner!,"This book basically lays out 5 steps to follow to calm your baby within min. and it does work very well, the book however is very repetitive and somewhat boring. It is cheap and may be a life saver for some people so it is worth checking out if you think it may be helpful. It is very conducive to attachment type parenting and helps give some historical/cultural background that maybe not all moms/moms to be know, but a lot of it I have read/heard elsewhere so it was not as insightful in that sense. My advice, save your self the time and money and check it out at the library and read the five steps and go on your way!"
3,Good book but a little redundant,"This book has a lot of great information. It's been very useful. However, they could have consolidated the entire book into a just a couple of chapters. A lot of the book is descriptions of how wonderful this technique has been for other parents (think info-merical). I have heard from several friends that there is a video that provides the same information in about 15 minutes. It's available at most libraries."
2,Beyond overrated,"This is one of the most overrated books I've ever come across. Skimming the book is all you need to get anything out of it, because it's extremely repetitive - and if you've educated yourself on babies' sleep needs, etc., you won't find anything new in this book. Much better books that worked for us are the Baby Whisperer and Good Night, Sleep Tight - our baby has been sleeping through the night since 2 months without crying - and we trusted ourselves that our son really didn't like having his arms swaddled. The Happiest Baby on the Block methods are not for every baby."
3,Content is good but you can find most of it online,"the 5 S's do actually work!! but you can rent this video from your library or find most of what you need to know online...i wouldn't buy it again, youtube has the basics."
5,ESSENTIAL,This is absolutely essential. Tried and true. Helped a ton to relax our new born. This pediatrician knows what he is talking about and backs it up with evidence. Very insightful book.
4,"Good information, awful presentation","First let me say that this is a great book. The information is fantastic and extremely logical. I particularly appreciated how Dr. Karp researched other ""non-colic"" cultures (there are hundreds of them) to form his approach. On the other hand, this reads like a sales pitch for a used car. The language is so simplistic that I actually felt insulted. There's a lot of self-congratulation on the author's part, which gets old quick. So get the book and look beyond the writing style. It's worth it."
2,"One good idea, 100 pages of padding","Karp's theory about calming newborns -- a good theory, as far as it goes -- could have been stated in about three pages. Since there's no money to be made with a three page book, he has to pad it out some.Unfortunately most of the padding involves either sniping at other techniques for calming newborns or else patting himself on the back for his own genius in having the theory he's got. He seems to be waiting for the phone call from the Nobel Prize people. That part is fairly nasty to read. Skim the book in the bookstore to get the important parts without the fluff."
5,The most useful book every newborn owner should have,"Could not have understood my newborn better than with this book. It hits you over the head with the five SSSs, but they are lessons well learned. I still swaddle my 4 month old, and she now sleeps up to 9 hrs doing so. the shaking the head S was my first success in how to get baby to sleep; i didnt realize until i had a baby that they don't fall asleep by themselves at first. you have to put them to sleep (yawn)"
5,Loved this book,REALLY helped us with our hard to console infant. Only method that worked for us and I also liked how it explained the theory behind the method so you can really buy into it before using it. A must read for parents of a newborn.
2,AWESOME book-- but get it from your local library,"This book should have been a pamphlet. The information is GREAT-- and specific, but the book repeats itself in every single chapter. Successive chapters are more-or-less the same thing in different words. There is a two page spread at the center of the book that summarizes the whole thing. If you skim the entire book and photocopy the center pages, you have more than enough to practice the technique. If I knew this, I would not have purchased the book, but would have just picked it up from my local library.However, don't let this deter you from reading it-- the author gives EXCELLENT advice on how to make a crying baby happy. he basically argues that ""colicy"" infants are a product of how we tend to raise babies-- and have nothing to do with any physical ailment whatsoever. He claims that almost NO other cultures have anything like ""colic"" and he answers the question ""why"" with a series of steps that restrict, soothe, and make your baby happy!"
1,Not such a great book,"The 5 things he writes are great, ones we've used for generations. So glad they are now written down, but he could have made it into a pamphlet. I think it was deceptive when he said ""if you do it correctly""... There's his out to his claim to make babies stop crying. The fact is, some babies cry. Mom's rock, swaddle, sing, use a binky and they still cry, bless their hearts. The devoted and frustrated mom hasn't done anything incorrectly, it's just how some sweet little ones are. And besides, how does he know what the cave-women thought, anyway? I'm shaking my head at how he made so much money by giving so little advice."
5,Saved My Sanity!,"It was 2:00 a.m. and I was alone with my brand new, 2 week-old angel that wouldn't stop crying. As most new mom's can understand, sleep-deprivation combined with recovering from a birth and learning first-hand just how unknowledgeable you really are about babies is enough to drive one insane.Well, between my tears, fear and, of course, overwhelming self-pity, I managed to pick up this book in the hope of finding some guidance at that ungodly hour. It took me about ten minutes to figure out how to bundle my baby and it worked. IT REALLY WORKED! That was the moment when my night-time troubles with my newborn ended. The mistake I made was waiting to read the book until AFTER my baby was born.Buy this book. Read it, practice its techniques (get the DVD if you can - it was great too). Your baby will thank you by letting you sleep!!!"
4,Great method. This really does work!,"However, I agree with a couple of the other reviews that the book did not need to be as long as Karp made it. While I don't agree that the information could be put in a pamphlet b/c the details he provides for how the 5 Ss work are important, not everyone is as intersted in the why. If that's your issue too, skip to about page 90 or so. That being said, I have given this book as a shower gift twice now (along with extra long receiving blankets for swaddling). The 5 Ss saved our sanity those first 3 months! As for weaning your baby from swaddling, Karp says to let your baby wean himself. I promise your 18 year old will not come to you with a blanket asking to be swaddled!"
5,Must-read for every parent-to-be!!!,"This book was a life-saver for us. My son was diagnosed with ""colic"", and the techniques in this book helped us calm him right away. Unlike some other authors, Dr Karp is kind and advocates gentle, baby friendly techniques. I now buy this book for every expecting parent I know!"
5,A Must Have for New Parents,"This book was given to me by a friend, and I made the mistake of not reading it, and buying into it, until my son was a few weeks old. Although it is written very simply, the information inside is invaluable. I don't know if I buy in to the 4th trimester philosophy, but the techniques really do work."
5,A must read for new parents of colicky babies,"This book is not only very interesting but also enlightening about the source of colic and steps towards a remedy. After trying everything I read this book about utilizing the ""five S's"" and discovered that the method works. The only difficult aspect is trying to swing the baby for long periods of time. This tends to lead to pulled arm muscles if the baby is very fussy. All in all this book is a great resource for all those red-eyed and frustrated parents looking for answers."
4,"Somewhat annoying, but effective","I agree with a previous reviewer that most of this book is fluff. It probably could be about 5 pages long, and the rest of it contains a lot of anecdotes, trying to persuade you that the techniques really work, plus wacky theories about evolution and why the techniques work. Some I assume are supposed to be funny, like the ""story"" of the cave woman watching a pterodactyl taking care of its babies. I also felt that the tone was somewhat condescending.However, the techniques really do work (at least they did for me) and that makes it worth it.If you want something that is scientifically accurate about brain development, I recommend ""What's Going On In There?"" by Lise Eliot.What's Going on in There? : How the Brain and Mind Develop in the First Five Years of LifeIt's not exactly light reading, but really interesting and not dumbed-down like this book. It also has a different theory relating to the immaturity of the brain at birth that I find much more plausible."
4,Good,"This is a good book with some great ideas but the testimonials get to be a little too much. Although I'm sure they are in there for our benefit, I found myself skipping them starting around the fourth chapter. I highly recommend it if you can get passed what (John and Jenn) did for (Amelia) every three pages."
1,Not the book or the class for anyone,"I took the happyist baby on the block class. I was very sad by it, first as other people have said it is mostly common sense but he also advocates the use of a pacifier, never once mentioned the calming effects of breastfeeding or wearing your baby. Also this is not a cure all for every single tiny cry the best way to help keep your child from fussing is to HOLD them.A much better book with tons of information is Dr Sear's The Baby Book."
2,Might be good if your baby is colicky,"I bought this book when I was still pregnant and did my best to get through it. That was difficult because it is incredibly repetitive. I don't need to be told something multiple times. He could tell you everything once and this book would be much more useful and only 10 pages long. I already knew the basics and thought this book would enlighten me. It didn't. It bored me. And, as it turned out, my son wasn't a crier so the information in it was completely useless to me. If you already have a colicky infant and have tried everything else, you might consider this book but otherwise, I'd save yourself some money and avoid it."
5,Purchased as a Gift,One of my newly wed very young co-workers is having her first child so I bought this and another book for her. She tells me often how much she is enjoying the books and she keeps sending me thank you notes so I take that as a very good sign!
1,Loved it now HATE it!!,AS others have said the first 3 months the 5 S's seem like a life saver. Here I am now with a 4 month old that has become addicted to the 5 S's and we now have some habits to break. I honestly wish I would have never heard of this book let alone buy it and follow it's advice. I JUST WANT MY BABY TO SLEEP UNSWADDLED!!!! It would be nice to be able to have others care for her as well but unless I make any care taker read the book they can't get her to sleep. AUGH!!!!! I hate this book!!
3,Not good for sleeping,"This book is really good for calming a crying baby, but not very useful for sleeping--our baby (now 3 1/2 months) cried when we put her down to sleep even when we used the 5 Ss, until she was about 2 months old and had learned to calm herself. I also found his reasoning regarding the ""fourth trimester"" a little ridiculous so as to be disregarded. I didn't like his seeming praise of tribal cultures where women breastfeed 100 times a day or babies are continually held 24 hours a day for the first year--that might be what babies want, but that is a completely unrealistic, and dare I say unhealthy, expectation for new parents."
2,"Redundant, but some good advices for <3m babies only","It feels that the book could be summarized in 1 chapter only. The writer keeps on repeating the same ideas again, again and again (5S techniques). Also, she presents some irrelevant examples just to extend the length of the book. Better be able to read fast, while baby is crying.Besides, all the tips in the book are only good for up to 3 months baby... title of the book must be changed accordingly.I am puzzled with the strictly positive feedback appearing first in the review webpage, and I honestly question their validity.On a positive note, the description of the 5S techniques is effective and detailed, and very helpful for new parents. Although I am hesitant to use the 2 S (Side / Stomach position sleep for the baby), as I read that stomach position sleeping might be fatal for baby."
2,the happiest baby on the block,"you sent me the wrong book. i have made unsuccesssful contacts and have not been able to resolve the issue.i'm sure the book is good, and i would like to read it."
2,Get me outa here!,"This book is very hard to read because of its constant reference that our babies are just animals and all the issues they have are basically problems evolution has created or hasnt solved yet. Some good tips (like how to properly swaddle your baby), but certainly not worth buying or reading the WHOLE book for.Does not really encourage any healthy parenting styles, only how to shut them up when you dont want them crying. I guess this book may be ok for colicky babies, but unless you have a crying issue, I recommend you purchase ""secrets of the baby whisperer"" or ""babywise 1"" for a healthy parenting approach (a balance somewhere between demand feeding & schedule feeding). [Babwise has aditional bonus that you can ring them (Growing Families International) & they can put you in contact with another mum for support.]I do not recommend ""happiest baby on the block"" to anyone, unless perhaps you have a colicky baby."
2,"Worth a paper, not a paperback.","My wife urged me to put down STUPID WHITE MEN to read this even though we're starting the adventure of son number three. I read through piles of doting hyperbole until Karp told all, on pages 126-127. Swaddling, (laying baby on) Stomach, Sh-ing, Swinging, and Sucking (a pacifier) -- none news -- is worth a paper, not a $15 paperback. Back to STUPID WHITE MEN, the book of substance."
5,Dr Karp rocks,This book is the best. The best part for us (new parents) was learning the white noise and swaddle techniques - total lifesavers.. Learn the 5 Ss and all will be good... Thanks Dr Karp!
3,Good information for young infants,"This was a good book to read because we're new parents. I was hoping that there was going to be more information than just the 5-6 tips to making out baby happy, but the 1 or 2 things I hadn't heard of where worth learning and trying. We do really have one of the happiest babies, which isn't entirely because of the steps we used from this book. It was worth the read."
3,"Great advice, not such a great read...","I loved the advice Dr. Karp presented, but I wasn't crazy about the style of the book. It was difficult to locate the specific recommendations about baby soothing without reading the entire book. Once I found the recommendations, I tried them and loved them, but I would rather have spent [less] on a slim paperback, than [more]on a larger hardcover. This book is full of anecdotes and philosophy, rather than lots and lots of great advice. Get it at the library or flip through it at the bookstore. Memorize the 5 S's and learn how to swaddle, and that's all you need!"
3,Kindle edition needs editing,"I bought the Kindle edition, so the review applies to the Kindle. The content of the book was good. I enjoyed reading it and feel like it gave me a lot of ideas and prepared me for soothing a baby. However, it did not translate well to the Kindle. Almost every page had some sort of typo. I could usually puzzle the word out in context but it made it harder to read. Other Kindle books I've bought have been perfect. There's no reason for this to have so many errors and that's why I rated it just 3 stars."
5,For the baby you never thought you'd have!,"Never in a million years do you think that sweet baby you brought home from the hospital is going to cry all night, and all day, and every hour in between. Never do you think they will HATE their bouncy seat, or the swing, or the bassinet. But if you are blessed to have one of these ""high needs"" children as Dr. Sears (highly recommend as well!) calls them, then this book will help bring sanity and sleep back into your home. It was a lifesaver with our sweet boy. I will say though not to have unrealistic expectations. Most of these ""high needs"" kids are just that. Once they hit about 6 months the fussiness will start to go away as it is replaced by curious wonder and need for stimulation. This will never be the baby that you can plop down in the bouncy seat for an hour while you make dinner. So get a sling or an Ergo, wear your baby, and enjoy every stage of amazement and wonder."
5,essential information for the new parent,"This book contains simple, essential sanity information for the new parent. One would not guess these techniques without being told. And they work."
3,It's ok for the first few month:,"This book is only effective until the baby is ~2-3 months old. My baby was fussy up until ~5 months and I purchased this book when he was 3 months old. He was already too old for the techniques to work. Great book for newborns, though!"
3,Good...but the DVD is better,"This has been a helpful book, however I hear that the DVD is better. We use some of the recommendations that Dr. Karp has made, however our child has not responded to a number of his recommendations. He has good ideas as long as you understand that each baby is unique and some of his theories do not apply to all babies.Otherwise helpful. Check out the DVD first."
3,good book,this book is a pretty good read.it helps explain a lot about fussy babies andprovides useful tips on how to deal with them.it gives some insight into the colicky label givento fussy babies and can really help parents withbabies that are fussy.
5,Brilliant,"I highly recommend this book as well as ""The Happiest Toddler on the Block"" (see my review) to all parents. I've read several baby books and Dr. Karp's is by far the most insightful and helpful.He refers to the first three months of an infants life as the fourth trimester, explaining that babies aren't really ""ready"" to be born yet. That is why the 5 S's work so well, because they ease the transition from the womb into the world.While this book is mostly about calming your fussy baby, I found a lot of other helpful and reassuring information in it as well. For example, he addresses sleep patterns, the importance of holding and bonding with your baby, advice for exhausted new parents, etc.I can't say enough positive about Dr. Karp. I would give this book six stars if I could. His approach is so loving and helps you keep your sense of humor!"
3,"Good info, but the same thing over and over",I purchased this book after all the great reviews. I feel like it could have been summed up in about 1/2 the time. He just states the same thing over and over again. I haven't given birth yet to try out his methods and will be sure to report back when and if I do. Find the cliff notes and save your $.
2,Repetitive,"I just recieved the book yesterday and by the end of the day i was done reading it. And i must say what a waste of time it was. Throughout i was expecting something else other than the 5's' the author talks about, but the same thing was repeated again and again.New Mom's you don't need to buy this book coz i can tell you in just 5 words what the book says in all its 267 pages.Basically the author also a pediatrician wants us to follow the 5's' to comfort a crying baby:5's':Swaddling: tight wrappingSide/Stomach: laying a baby on her side or stomachShushing: loud white noise shhhhhhh....Swinging: rythmatic, jiggly motionSucking: sucking on anything from your nipple or finger to a pacifier.So there you have it. Buy your baby a new toy rather than a book with repetition."
1,Incomplete information,"There is nothing in the description of this product that I could find that says how many pages there are in this pad. Did I miss it, or is it missing?"
1,BAD SPELLING AND GRAMMAR A TURN-OFF,"I got this book from the local library and started noticing terrible spelling and grammar was very prevalent. Sorry but I can't take a book this badly proof-read seriously at all. It was so bad I quit reading before I got to the third chapter. If it is indeed written by a ""college professor"" he should go back to grade school and learn the basics of the english language!!! You would think by the third edition this would have been corrected!"
5,Extremely good book,A very good book that looks at the ordinary lives of farmers' farm laborers and rural craftsmen in Victorian England. Very well researched.And written in a a very readable way
5,Wonderful Relaxer,I love the relaxer it works fast and is easy to use. Be sure to get the conditioner when you purchase this though as they work hand in hand. You put in the conditioner prior to the neutralizing shampoo. The only negative is the RI-DIC-U-LOUS shipping costs.
3,Bound (1996) VHS,"Bound is an ""Okay Movie"",it's only worth watching if your a guy who enjoys the stuff :) the story is typical, the love scenes if you can them that aren't not that much. and Frankly watching a butch and a pretty girl is pretty gross. Jennifer Tilly is beautiful ,yet Gina Gershon(clinton buddy) is gross in the film. then there's Joe Pantoliano(Risky Business,The Sopranos) he's pretty good in the movie. Overall it's worth watching albeit on skin-a-max."
3,Love and greed,"The best part of this movie is Joe Pantoliano's performance as an ingratiating, numbingly vicious gangster, convincingly interposing the smarminess with the cruelty. There are a number of ganagster characters exhibiting horrifyingly graphic viciousness. Pantoliano's moll is Jennifer Tully, and her lover is Gina Gershon. Both turn in adequate performances, making this a fairly entertaining movie. The sex scenes are predictable, and Gershon's performance as a blue collar lesbian who is a pretty good handyman seems a trifle contrived. The pair scheme to steal 2 million dollars. Will they get away with it? Will they betray each other? The suspense is not exactly nail biting, but on the whole the movie delivers."
4,"Long on style and plot, a little short on the ladies","Jeez, the film is good looking. The sets, costumes, the leads, the production, the editing, etc. The plot twists involving the heist are tricky and unpredictable. I had not seen Joe Palotiano before and he has energy to burn.Unfortunately, the twisting plot was at the expense of the relationship developement between the two ladies. The seduction scene came on really fast (and is still hard to beat because it was so convincingly verbal and not visual - the close up of Meg Tilly's heavy breathing and shaking, her ghasping whipers, pleading to Gina Gershon - well, I certainly bought it!). But once the steam clears, it's a full on robbery/cheesy mafia movie. The uniqueness of the ladies gets swept aside.Sorry to be nitpicking, but it sure would've been nice if the by-the-numbers Mafia stuff was replaced by some other classier motif"
4,GIRLS WITH GUNS,"and alot more. The Wachowski Brothers have a great film here that knows exactly what it is: great suspense, smart enough to make sense and a thrill a second joy ride. BOUND is an ultimate guilty pleasure, but for all the RIGHT reasons! Solid performances from Gina Gershon, Jennifer Tilly and John Ryan, in his best role since KOJAK (""Cop In A Cage"" 1974). Tom Jones sings ""She's A Lady""...RIGHT!!!"
4,Mob/Lesbian Flick,"Decent movie, great characters, sexy actresses! Definitely watchable and the ending is awesome! If you can get it cheaper, try."
5,What are you waiting for???,"This movie is a gem. Had to drive to Chapel Hill from Greensboro, NC in 1996 to see this film when it first 'came out', since GSO wasn't gonna show it and had no intention to!! Wow - was it worth the gas money and then some!! What a wonderful movie! Suspense, sex, love, murder, theft, betrayal... need I go on? Yes, film noir. Yes, lesbian sex (and how!) Yes, Jesse Helms would hate it (but I'd love to make him watch it with his wife!) RUN to rent or own this film!! DVD is probably the best bet since you can see the DIRECTOR's commentary, too. Very interesting. In any event, this movie is fun to watch, never boring, and who can argue with the star power and chemistry of Joey Pants, Gina Gershon, and the voluptuous Jennifer Tilly?!?!? Check it out and have some fun!!"
5,Excellent,"I find most of what Hollywood puts out to be absolute crap, but not 'Bound'. This movie is actually quite good and entertaining. The performances are memorable and the plot intriguing, however it does get off to somewhat of a slow start. Be warned that the movie does make liberal use of the f-word as well as plenty of graphic violence, not to mention a very well done girl-girl love scene."
4,"Great movie, better the 2nd time around","This is a really well done film, good screenwriting, directing, and acting. The DVD was excellent quality and I really liked the movie better the second time I saw it. It was unrealistic to have all the gunfire in a condo and not have the cops swarm the place. It would definitely not be mistaken for a TV turned too loud. That's really the only nit I could find to pick. Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly really lit (and steamed) up the screen. Buy the unrated version, it's a keeper."
3,Esquisit. (Sp?),"I loved Bound. Gina Gershon is SO HOT! Jennifer Tilly has the sexiest voice in the film. I could have done without the finger cutting off scene. But I guess is was part of the whole ""Mob"" effect. Sweet!"
4,gimmick,"Okay Bound was a pretty good movie but the plot has been done before. The movie itself would have played out the same if "" Corky "" was a guy. What makes the movie good is the plot after Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly start their relationship. Everything before is so stereotypical it hurts. The lesbian part of this movie plays as a marketing tool. It's still a good movie to watch, but just remember not all lesbians rob from gangsters, and wear black"
3,Worth a viewing.,"Bound was a decent movie that sported some good acting from the entire cast. I don't consider it to be a great movie, but it no doubt is satisfying and worth a watch. Bound was quite extreme in every department. The plot didn't totally interest me, but this was still worth a viewing."
4,as exciting as they come,"From the makers of _The Matrix_, here is evidence that gangster noir is alive and kicking in the trunk of American cinema's Cadillac. The acting is uniformly great, the thrills are intense. _Bound_ has an impressive number of completely unexpected, perfectly timed moments of tension. The cinematography is excellent."
5,It 's a MUST see and a CRIME not to have!!,"It's about time someone made a good lesbian moive that is worth a sofa and a ""DO NOT ENTER"" sign. I LOVED this moive, the love the way they both fought together until the end. Each one waiting, loving, caring for one another. Both girls were SEXY, SMART, LOVELY, boy !! what a turn on. It's a must see and a must have, this is a movies that has it all. I LOVE IT !!!!!!!! This Moive has a rating of 100 stars and more !!"
5,Gotta love those love scenes...,By far one of the best movies i have ever seen! Tilly and Gershon have that chemistry that shows up ... and the whole tattoo scene should get to anyone... one of my faves and a definite owner!
5,Female Mob Movie,"Bound was the first movie made by the Wachowski brothers, of Matrix fame. Bound stars Gina Gershon as Corky, a lesbian ex con hired to work in an apartment as a plumber. She meets neighbor Caesar, who launders money for the mob, and his girlfriend Violet. The two women have a love affair and decide to steal $2,000,000 that Caesar is holding for the mob. Caesar is set up by the two scheming women as a scapegoat and then things get very violent. The movie could be less violent, but overall it was great to see two female leads in a mafia movie."
3,"Great Little Movie, Well Photographed, But Not In Anamorphic","So again, there's no point in me buying this DVD since it won't work on my widescreen TV."
4,Bound review,This is a fast paced crime thriller. A must view for fans of the creators of The Matrix Trilogy.
2,Overrated borefest now,"""Bound"" might've been hot stuff back in 1996, and I think this movie is still riding on that, but now it's just dated, mundane ""been there, done that."" I caught this on cable a few days ago, and it's a snoozefest. Maybe all the movies since this was released had rendered the femme fatale genre not a big deal anymore, and thus this movie is not a big deal anymore.It's just another DVD you'd be wasting your money on."
2,explicit but not tasteful.,"I was severely dissapointed with Bound. Its explicit sexuality is not tasteful, but serves to exploit the women in the movie. If you're looking for plot, try again. If you're looking for sexuality, see ""Better than Chocolate,"" which has both tasteful sensuality *and* plot content (deals with real-life issues)."
3,Zzzzzzzzz,"Bound main appeal is not the alright crime plot behind it, or the powerful performances by the lead actors. No what makes Bound so appealing is the one moment of HLA, or Hot Lesbian Action. At least that's how I heard of it.Any who Bound is about this biker chick who moves into a new appartment. Next door there is this couple, the man works for the mo and the wife and just stays at home. The wife becomes attracted to her new neighbor and in the first half hour there is some decent HLA. After that the rest of the movie spirals around a plot to steal some money from the mob and the husband and escape as a rich couple. Things don't always go as planned and the husband discovers the plan, but by then the moneys already gone, and he has killed 2 mob members. Overall the plot is alright, and the acting needs some work. Overall it gets an extra star because it did have that good HLA moment."
1,I can't believe it,"People (mostly guys) think this movie is great because it' centers around two lesbs. They think the romance seen is great because of the lesbs. Yet, people who watched Alexander were so afended because of the homesexual innuendos, so they gave the movie very low socres. This movie is a trash hands down! The only thing good about this movie was the mafia scene and that's it. By the way, if peple can accept two females having sex on the screen, then they should accept the movie Alexander's homosexual scenes!"
5,Manuel makes this a masterpiece,"Without the soulful voice of Richard Manuel, this album would be drowning in MOR. But he lifts the music into an indescribably emotional area - Right as Rain, Georgia on my mind particularly. He performed almost the same miracle on Northern Lights, Southern Cross. Maybe Islands contains markedly inferior songs and some lacklustre performances, but it is nowhere near as bad as it has been painted. Listen to Richard..."
1,So wrong!,"I don't quite know what happened to the Band on this album. The individual talents don't shine through the awful material. How did they dare put this out? Quite simply the worst album ever made by the finest group. I blame Robbie Robertson - who has not produced a note of good music since the band split. Good job they did; he didn't drag the others down with him. Robertson went on to produce drippy Neil Diamond, while Levon and co. continued doing what we all love.I have tried to enjoy this album - just one little bit of it. Knockin' Lost John is pretty good, but that hardly makes up for the rest of it. It was pretty brave of the label (Capitol?) to re-release it. I believe you can buy CCR's ""Mardi Gras"" too. I would pay for them both to be obliterated from history."
4,"""Easy listening"" from The Band","I do not want to repeat what everone says about this album being an illegitimate child of this great band. It has been beaten by the critics, fans, and even by the band itself. However, this is still a joy to listen, particularly when you are in the mood for something light and cheerful. From the delightful opening of ""Right as Rain"" to the peaceful charm of ""Christmas must be Tonight"" to the bright horns of ""Livin' in a Dream,"" the music here will ease your heart. To me, the stand-out cover of ""Goergia on My Mind"" is even rather out of context for this album."
1,Mio doesn't take care of customers,"Be very careful about installing the mount on the windshield. Mine fell off, the screen impacted the gear shift and cracked. Mio is denying warranty repair. They tell me I installed it incorrectly. They are willing to spend $133 to send the suction cup mount to Germany for testing, but they are unwilling to make a customer happy.I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Too good for the price,"Had pretty much decided to go with Nuvi 350, but when I went in to store I found this cute little GPS for half the price. I bought it thinking would return it even if I find flaw, but I must say mio has surpassed all my expectations. The user interface is intuitive, but dont try to learn how to use the product from the manual. The manual sucks. The POI database is decent, infact its on par with all the other GPS's if you exclude the 3+ mill POI boasted by other manufactures that applicable to canada and europe :). Took this for my boston city and I am home back safely. Highly recommended"
4,it gets you there...,"I got this about four years ago. I'm not a big traveler... probably travel fives a year the most. This is a very reliable, cheap, not to costly Navigation system. It gets the job done... It's not the best GPS. But if you want a GPS for a few trips here and there, that you're only going to use once in a while, this is the one for you."
1,Unit can not be updated.,"Purchased this unit with the understanding that map updates were to come very soon. However, there are no map updates available. This unit is a complete waste of money. Roads change often and Mio does not update the maps.... Very low volume on this unit and it does not have text to speech feature. It has some nice features but, outdated maps right out of the box. Now I am stuck with this useless GPS. I got it at PepBoys and now they tell me they didn't sell the unit...."
1,In the trash!,"After fighting with this GPS for just over a year I threw it out with the trash tonight & just ordered a Megellan Maestro 4250 that my husband has & is quite happy with (& knew better than to trade mine for!). The Mio has never been reliable -- from shutting down for no apparent reason, to requiring me to enter the same destination over and over before it calculates a route, to continually losing its signal, to not recognizing its own map card -- and was not worth a penny of what I paid for it. My advice: spend a little extra money to save yourself a ton of frustration!"
1,"No support, does not support Vista, No Map Updates",I have the H610 which I purchased to find it doesn't support MS Vista. Combine this with no map updates and it becomes useless. I have contacted Mio multiple time and got no useful responce. They even justifiy mapping errors by say your doing some thing wrong!
3,Not as good as I thought,I was told that the SatNav freezes some times. I have the C320 model sold in Europe and I never had such problem here with my model.
2,Not user friendly,"I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my Mom. She is not tech savvy, but I thought a GPS system would be easier and safer than following printed directions while driving. I wanted something easy where you can just type in a starting address, an ending address, and then just follow the directions (similar to online map software). Unfortunately, I found this device not user friendly, even for a more tech savvy person like myself. It was not intuitive how to use, and you have to poke keys on a digital keyboard with fingers, which was difficult to do without hitting nearby keys. I found the maps challenging to navigate, and I couldn't figure out how to zoom out/in and easily pan without affecting the route. The user guide was only on the CD, and at 87 pages long, I realized that this product is only for the most patient and determined person. Knowing that my Mom would not go to this much trouble to learn and use it, I returned it. I hope there are easier GPS systems out there."
4,Mio C220 GPS,This product is everything the ad says it is and more. For the money you can not beat it anywhere.
1,Mio used to make quality devices,"I had a very nice experience with a Mio GPS that I'd purchased about 5 years ago for about $150.I found one at Radio Shack this last X-mas for about the same and bought 2 figuring it would be much improved - boy was I wrong!1st of all - no spoken street names - alright I can live with that (My old Mio did that)2nd - when you turn on your street it takes a good 10 seconds to update to the next turn - making you miss your turn usually -and before the address comes up when you arrive at your destination street, it takes 20 seconds to display the address, so keep that handy (My old Mio updated promptly)3rd - on a 1/2 mile trip, many times it will take you on a 20 mile detour. (My old Mio never did that)If your not familiar with where you are, you'd be better off asking directions from a homeless woman.Don't buy Mio unless you are stupid."
2,Product died after one year,"This product was mediocre. Unfortunately it died just over one year of use. When it was working, occasionally it would do annoying things, for example, if you are driving on a freeway, it would say ""stay to the left"" as a means for you not to exit the freeway. If you are an obedient driver, you would move to the far left lane of the freeway, then as soon as an exit turnoff has passed, it would say ""now exit right"" and if there were lots of cars in the way, it would be difficult to make it all the way to the exit lane.The only thing I really liked about it was the British accent and that I can use the power source to charge my cellphone (Blackberry). Other then that, I'm sure there are much better GPS systems out there."
1,Useless..i ended up returning mine,"I bought it looking at the reviews that looked pretty decent. But it was a mistake. It does not work.Cons:the voice is too low you cannot hear it unless you are carrying it in your hand by your ear.the signal is lost constantly and does not recognize where you are and it starts recalculating from the wrong addressthe two times that it took me to the right place, it took me a very long route around an hour instead of 40 minutesPro:It has a lot of points of interest but some are outdated."
2,Old map data,"The unit is nice and a great value however the map data is so old you will often not find your destination, which is really frustrating. Also don't bother with this unit if you are going to Canada ever. You may be better served by spending a little more and getting current maps. After all that is the reason for a nav system right?"
1,Support/Warranty Horrible,"Mio C220 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorGot the system for holiday present, thought initially it was affordable and had most of the features I wanted. HOWEVER, the touch screen was not responding and I pushed the section of the screen a little harder and the whole face of the screen cracked. I am on with tech support who may charge me to replace or fix the unit. Completely NOT what the warranty read. Great, cheap unit but they don't back it up if normal customer use presents a problem. Another $130 dollars out the window!"
3,"good, but not excellent","I bought this item several weeks ago and now I think I can write some reviews for others.First, this is a good GPS. Usually it can receive nine to ten satellites' signals. The maximum inaccuracy is usually within ten feet. The point of interest(POI) includes many places you may be interest in.Second, it's as excellent as you may expect. That's because the system is easily down. Once every ten days, I think.It is worth the price; however, if you are looking for a better one, go to Garmin, I think."
2,Mio C220 GPS Unit,"The unit works okay. Haven't tried it in unfamiliar territory yet but I know it misses roads around here. It isn't easy to set up. I have had to play with it a bit and I still can't get some things like I would like. It probably wasn't the best choice for someone like me who has very little experience with a GPS receiver. The other more important problem is there is no support from the company for getting new maps for the USA. I have not found any place where I can get updated maps for the thing. The Tele Atlas company they mention for maps doesn't do maps for the USA, at least not for this unit and the company itself doesn't supply updates so in that respect it isn't worth the price or maybe it is one of those things, you get what you pay for. Spend the extra and get a Garmin or some other more sophisticated unit and make sure you can get new maps with what ever you buy."
1,Customer service stinks,After a few months my device would not charge consistently. Customer service wanted me to go buy a USB charger for a computer so then I could determine if the problem was the device or the charger. When I said that this was not an acceptaple solution they said I would have to pay shipping and handling to mail the device AND the charger cable back to them. This was the second stike against this device. The first one is that it did not contain my parent's address even though they have lived in their house for 4 years. There is no way to get updated maps so you better hope it has the ones you need. Documentation is also not that great.
2,Piece of museum,"I bought a C220 MIO GPS a year ago, it works fine, but there are no map updates. They offer updates for newer products only, go figure.I will not buy another product from this company. I doubt they will last very long anyway."
5,Great for the price!,"Amazing little unit for the price. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of more expensive units but then it doesn't cost as much either. I was looking for a small, stand alone unit that was actually big enough to use (unlike the H610 which is so small you could never use it in a car) and this fits the bill. It is small enough to fit in my purse or pocket and has no bulky cable on it. There is no MP3 player but then I have an iPod for that. The instruction booklet doesn't explain everything at all but after you play with the unit for a while you can figure things out. The display is easy to read and the voice is loud enough to hear. I also like the pedestrian mode. All in all, I love this thing!"
2,Windows CE crash proned!,"I like most of the users here, thought this is was a great device at a great price. That's until I started to use this a bit more and this thing started to crash very frequently. Yes, crash just like a Windows application. When this happened, the system display a chain of the miogps.exe and mioutil.exe application fatal error messages, of which you can't close or click the ""X"" mark. Since this system does not have a pinhole reset button like most other GPS that uses Windows CE, this crash crippled the OS enough so I can't even shutdown the system or perform a soft restart. The only thing to get out of this mode is to let the battery drain and force the system to shut down on its own. This is a major problem if you are visiting an unfamiliar area and relying solely on this device for direction. I find the lack of a hardware/pinhole reset capability is absolutely unacceptable for a device so prone to crash. It really puts your safety at risk!!!"
2,Disappointed in this product,"We found this system difficult to learn. The instruction manual is 113 pages and on a CD. Without the exact address of a destination the system comes up with multiple answers for a general locale. It is hard to read when driving especially if one wears corrective lens glasses. When in the traveling mode it is not useful unless you know where to go in advance. Would not recommend it or buy it again, and am returning it."
1,Very unhappy with the Mio C220,"The MIO C220 GPS was not easy to use (non-intuitive)and could not figure out a new route when we diverted from the suggested route. Even when we were right on or near an obvious route, it suggested a different route. Using it was frustrating and a bad experience."
1,c220,"SUCKS!!! SUCKS!!! SUCKS!!! I have three c310x's and like them alot but was getting tired of waiting on the ""supposedly"" spring map updates. Thought I'd try the c220 or c520 but finances dictated the c220. It was a little more accurate than my c310x but Holy Cow.... you could hardly see the screen or hear the voice prompts. The reviews at the CNET website chew it to pieces. I am in awe of the people who say this a great unit. If they ever update the maps of the c310x, it may be the best MIO ever gets. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT AT CIRCUIT CITY!!! They wanted to charge me a $30 restocking fee for a crummy unit. The best they would do is set me up with another crummy unit. I got another c310x, walked away and kicked the dust of my shoes."
4,1st choice in $200 GPS,"I bought it for 2 reasons: brand&design.; I really like the industrial design, slim and simple. I did lots of surveys, and I found C220 is worth buying in $200 GPS. In this price, you can't find products in the same level from Tomtom&Garmin.; Other brands maybe cheaper but don't look solid.The only thing I'm not satisfied is the ROM size(US version=256MB, while Taiwan&French; version=512MB). However it's not an issues for ordinary users. This GPS package only comes with the car charger. So you'd better get a AC charger by yourself(any kind of mini USB charger works. I bought a RAZR charger for $5.99)The other great thing about C220 is it's hackable, although harder to do compared with other MIO's PND. But even you play it in original ways, it won't let you down."
2,ONLY COMES WITH CAR CHARGER!,"received the gps yesterday but it only came with the car charger. Without the Sd card it's pretty much useless. From what the ad said i was under the impression that i would not only be getting the GPS and car charger, but the device holder,windshieldmount,DVD with software and documentation, and the SD card with the complete US map. Opon contacting the seller, he told me that it was just for the GPS and car charger. No where in his ad does it say that.UPDATE!6/11/2012- Ended up returning the device because MIO no longer makes maps for this version so i cannot use it! Seller said he would issue me a refund. If you want a good deal on a refurbished GPS that actually includes what the ad states, go to tigerdirect.com"
1,Routs on this are terrible,This thing takes forever to find satillites. The routs on this thing are just plain dumb. it takes long to get to your destination. I would not buy this thing if i were you. BUT HEY I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!
3,Good...but not great,"Obviously one can't expect all gps devices to be up to date (and this one isn't) and also, I don't like how one touch of the screen makes a mark of that location like u want to go to that place. Overall, it's a decent device but one should have a familiarity with where they are while using this."
2,Extremely frustrating,"I got this GPS not too long ago and was originally happy to have one. Slowly, I became more and more frustrated for various reasons.1. It will tell you the opposite of what you need to do. Meaning, it will say ""keep left"" when you actually should keep right. Many times I've had to turn around because of this.2. It will take you on some of the worst possible routes. Obviously, it's not human and doesn't have reason and logic like a human brain, but some routes seem incredibly stupid.3. Maps are VERY out of date. Even if roads have been built a decade ago, they won't be on the GPS and you'll often find yourself driving on what it thinks is an open field.4. Lack of POI's. You can't trust this unit to know where even common and popular locations are.At first, I didn't care that this unit didn't have many bells and whistles. But now, that seems like all the more reason to upgrade. Other GPS's are around $100 nowadays. Keep shopping."
5,Great Price / Value ratio,"First, let me say that our whole family is ""direction challenged"". It actually happened once that I left Houston for Dallas and found myself arriving in San Antonio. As a result, having something to help me navigate is a godsend.I frequently have to go somewhere I've never been before. As a magician, it's not uncommon to be hired to perform in someone's home, and finding my way there can be a chore. I bought the Mio C220 last week, and used it for two gigs over the weekend. Before the end of the day, I was in love with it. Easy to use, every essential feature I can imagine, and has a price tag that doesn't break the bank. Highly recommended."
3,"Good entry level GPS unit, needs a few tweaks though.","Let me start by saying how great this unit is, for its price, design, and ease of use. I never leave home without it when I drive. After using the mio c520x from my brother, I decided to buy one since its $199 at Circuit City. in my opinion, Mio is one of the best GPS nav companies out there. Maybe not for overall design..The only REAL problem that I get from this unit is the maps. It is not the most updated map. I did a side by side test with the mio c520x, did the same directions, and found that the C520x's are more accurate. It doesn't make that makes the unit better though. As it shares it own problem. Another one is the POI. Its really outdated. Some business dont even exist anymore and yet its still listed. I really wish that Mio would update the POI's and Maps for this unit. No updates is listed yet on their website."
1,do not buy this unit,"bought this unit for Christmas and found it very frustrating. The interface is not at all intuitive. We have 4 very computer-savvy people in our family, and NONE of us could make it work. There is an 87-page manual which can only be viewed as a .PDF file -- not very useful when you're in traffic and don't have a laptop along. We returned this unit and do not plan to buy any Mio products again."
1,Do not buy the C220,"The C220 is an old product and apparently they are not updating it--I called support and got nothing. For about $10 more you can get the C230 which has updated maps (you can't get a new map for the C220), better voice navigation (streets are named when you turn on them: ""Turn left at Smith St."" instead of ""Take next left""). Or you could consider a different manufacturer entirely."
4,Mio C220,"Great GPS device for people with ok direction skills. Took a couple of days to understand buttons, but it's easy now. Simple GPS model that gets you where you need to be! I love the ""POI"" function that can find you the nearest gas station, hotel or resturant!If you live in a busy city, it might be helpful to upgrade to a GPS device that gives you traffic reports, but the Mio C220 works great for me and I live in LA! I bought one for my girlfriend and she LOVES it, plus, you can't beat the price...great gift for someone you care about."
2,"Nice hardware, but Mio won't sell you maps of other countries","I have grown to like this little unit quite a bit, but I have discovered that I made a bad assumption when I bought it. When I saw that the maps were on SD cards, I figured I would just be able to buy maps for other regions when I needed them. Not so, it turns out. I actually called Mio tech support to see where I could buy a map of Canada for my next trip to Toronto, and I was told that ""foreign"" maps won't work in the US units. The telephone rep had been pretty polite up to that point, but when I said I certainly wouldn't buy a a Mio in the future, because they aren't much use to folks who need to travel to Canada, she got kind of snippy. She said ""Well, that's your choice,"" and then added ""You can buy a separate Mio Canadian unit.""Yeah... or I could just buy a GPS that lets me install new maps.Steer clear of this one folks. It's not worth the ""savings."""
1,Nightmare!!!,"why do you want to buy a GPS? because you want it to guide you to your destination. But how about if it leads you to a wrong location? NIGHTMARE!! I am so frustrated and have been driven to crazy after using this crash-prone box from 2 week ago!The BIGGEST problem is that the map is not accurate!you can try those addresses:1628 E southern ave, tempe,az400 mountain ave, murray hill,nj,07974if you can borrow one, try to drive there to take a look!!!The 2nd problem is its poor/stupid/idiotic routing algorithm which always tells you a serpentine route which you will hit a lot of stop signs even if there is a highway around!! no matter which routing policy you select!"
1,Piece of garbage,"This is my first gps and boy should I have sprung for something a bit pricier and reknown. That old saying ""you get what you pay for"" is definitely apropos.Pros: Compact - that's itCons: Not very intuitive. The unit will calculate these out of the way directions when shorter/quicker directions are available. My advice is to stay away from this unit and purchase something else. I hate it."
2,Doesn't come with a Canadian map!,"This unit worked well in the US. However, I bought this unit because I run errands to Canada very often. It was a waste of time on buying this unit. I returned this unit and got a Garmin C330 and it worked above my expectations"
3,OEM box?,"It is said to be a new item at the website. But it is actually in an unsealed white box, not the original box. So I returned it and get full refund. At least they are honest and fast in refund.For the people who dones not mind the open box, it may be worthy of buying."
3,No Real Test Yet.,I bought the chains to travel through the mountains in northern California and southern Oregon. Those roads were bare and dry that day so no real test.
2,WARNING -- Does not fit 205/50R17 tires!!,"I bought these chains based on the great reviews on Amazon. But like another customer had stated, these chains were too small to fit on my 205/50R17 tires despite the fact that my size was listed as compatible on the product AND I followed the installation instructions to the letter. I eventually had to go to a local auto store and pay full price ($30 more than the Amazon price) for ones that fit. What a waste of time. So if you have 205/50R17 tires, you need the Super Z6 model SZ131.Other than that, the product was of very good quality and neatly packed in a nylon bag including instructions and plastic gloves."
5,SZ143 Cable Chains,Product arrived promptly and as advertized. Carrying case is a better than a box. Have not used yet (meant for emergencies) but appears excellent and well made.
1,Wrong Size!!,"These cables do not fit 255/70/18! Their chart list and their website indicate the SZ447 model but they are too small.Security Chain Company Super Z6, SZ447, Cable Chain for Pickups & SUVs - Set of 2"
2,"Great on snow, dangerous on dry road!","These cables are very easy to put on and take off. They're also fairly great on snow. I have a front drive Acura EL and these have done just fine in the 'great Seattle snowstorm of 2010' but it's very dangerous driving with these when there are even small patches of dry road, especially on hills: the chains slip like there's no tomorrow! If I had to choose again, I'd prob just invest in a pair of winter tires."
4,"Nice Cords, tough to install","These are pretty hard to put on. The instructions say to put these on from the bottom up. That is just impossible, maybe because my tires a wide Toyo's. You need to drape over the top and then connect at the bottom, unlike what the instuctions tell you. The chains are very tight, but the size is right. I have not driven in the snow with them, but I am confident that they will be great. I just hope the bungee tightener in the middle does not snap because it is stretched to the max."
4,No Complaints,No complaints. product arrived on time with no defects or missing parts. will order again. Thats all I have. For now
4,Great chains - definitely recommended!,"We live on a mountain, and even snow tires and AWD sometimes aren't enough. We have traditional chains on other vehicles now and in the past, which work great. I decided to try these since they are lighter and can be installed without moving the vehicle. We use them on a 2006 Toyota Sienna.They take about the same time to install as regular chains and about the same time to take off. Although you can install them without moving the vehicle, 90% of the time you'll have to move the vehicle after you un-hook them to take them off. The wheels won't typically stop in the right place. That isn't a huge deal though.We don't use them heavily, and never on hard pavement - our roads are dirt/gravel.One other note - the rubber retainer is somewhat difficult to stretch and attach to the chains. This might be a little difficult for someone who doesn't have a decent amount of arm strength, but not impossible."
1,DOES NOT FIT 225/40/18 tires,I ordered SZ133 according to the fitting guide for my 225/40/18 tires. And it's next to impossible to fit in on my tires. I've tried multiple times in the garage but in vain. It's a big downer. They should not have marked this one as 225/40/18 compatible.
1,Poor quality,"Used twice; 3 of 4 broke, causing extensive damages. SCC does not back up their products.Is easy to install and more comfortable ride than standard chains. Thule is much better product."
4,Traction on ice,"I have only had to use these once on ice, but the product did as advertised. I have not yet used them in deep snow so I am unable to comment on any improvements in traction there. This system is very easy to install and remove and with a little practice I had them on in under six minutes and off into the storage bag in about 8 minutes. It is a good product to have here in the Northeast.Addendum: On 10/29 - 10/30 we had an ice and snow storm (Named Alfred). These chains helped me get home through the early stages of the storm. About 8"" of accumulation on Rte. 140 from Union Ct. back to Stafford Springs. This is very windy and hilly terrain through the woods and around downed trees and branches. These chains performed beautifully and helped my keep slow and steady all the way home. They do make noise, so be ready for that. Travelling about 30 to 35 MPH they drone out a growl that can get a bit irritating, but it sure beats crashing."
4,Easy to install.... just now need to use them!,"I purchased these Super Z6, SZ143 Cable Chains for my 2010 Chevy Equinox. I tested the installation prior to heading up to the mountains. All I wanted to say is they are very SIMPLE and EASY to install! It took less than 10 minutes (the first tire took about 7 minutes and the second tire took about 2 minutes) and I've never used chains like these before. The only thing though is that I didn't need to use them on my particular trip up to the mountains, so I can't comment on the function of these yet."
5,Awesome products from this company....,"I have used this company for several years now, and I have always had good luck with their products. I am a Firefighter by trade so I have to be at work when the time come. I have a Chevy S-10 and I am using the Super Z6 in some heavy ice and snow and have been able to get where I need to be ontime every time. They work great and you still have a pretty smooth ride. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs that extra little bit of traction to get where you are going. Very easy to install and un-install when you are finished with them."
3,Try before buy,"My tire size of 175/65R-14, chains are very diffucult to install, must take-up every last bit of slack, only then, and just barely will the last connection fit, can't imagine trying this in cold temps, at night, with gloves.This was the reccomended size.If not for the fit problem this looks like a good product for occational use."
2,Cable chains & alloy wheel vehicles,"If you do not want to exceed 30 mph or do not care about possible damage to your expensive alloy wheels then this product is for you. Otherwise I would skip cable chains and just buy snow tires with studs (if allowed in your state) for worry free snow & ice on long commutes. Because the manufacture will print same in small print attached to their product after you have purchased the Super ""Z"" cble chains and thought I would be up front with your next purchase."
3,Better than nothing,Bought these for our Toyota RAV4 for trip to Wyoming.Disappointed they are made in China.Never used them but pre-fit them before trip.Not exactly easy to use.Hate to have to put them on with snow and slush.Plan on a change of cloths if you do.Bag is kind of small.Zipper loop came apart with first use.Hope chains dont fall apart with use like bag did.About what I expect from Chinese goods.Better than nothing.Provides peace of mind. At least once.Maybe.
1,The size is wrong for my Toyota Avalon tire,"the SCC Winter traction product applications by tire size chart is wrong, and it is nearly impossible to install it on my Avalon. The size is too small for 205/65-15 tire. I can't close the chain, can't put the rubber on."
1,good idea poorly executed,"No way to install these, defective attachment devices. Seems like a good idea for installing chains, but manufacturing error makes impossible to install. Could not install with car on the ground, on a lift or with the tire off the car. For what these cost, you think they would inspect at the factory before sending to distributors. I have been using tire chains of various types for over forty years and have never had this much trouble. Amazon accepted in return and refunded without problem."
1,WRONG SIZE!!!,The fitment guide is completely wrong compared to what the packaging for the chains said. I ordered SZ131 for my BMW 330ci tires 245/40/17 per the chart but they are too small... Very frustrated and annoyed that this company does not have their labels and charts correct.
4,good design!,"I got these for my wife's car. What's nice about it is you don't have to drive over the cable to put them on. You just wrap it around the tire, hook up the breaks in the cable, and use the plastic clips to pull the cable toward the center of the tire. Pretty easy as long as you have the strength to do it. If my wife could put them on herself, I'd give this 5 stars.Now that I got them, I hope I don't have to use them. But if it snows again, I'll be better prepared!"
3,"Good chains, IF THEY FIT...","I could not get these chains to fit on my tires. I have 185/65 R14 tires and that is listed on the package as being compatible, however I found that the chains were too tight. I could get only the first fastener on easily. The second fastener took some struggling to attach. The final fastener and the tensioners were IMPOSSIBLE to get on.I followed instructions exactly and even watched the videos on their website to make sure I didn't do anything wrong.Be forewarned! Make sure they fit before you go out to the snow!I'm sure its a fantastic product, if it fits."
3,Chain doesn't fit,"According to the chart, it should fit my tire size 315/35R20, but it is too short. I must return it. I wonder when they will fix their chart to prevent this inconvenience."
4,got them fast.....and they fit,"After considerable research I ordered a pair of these from Amazon. They arrived very quickly. As recommended, I tried them on my 07 Chevy Impala prior to stowing them in the trunk. They are the ""easiest to install"" snow chains/cables I have ever used...and I have used a bunch of them. They are also easy to remove. We'll see how well they perform when I get caught in a snowstorm. Be sure to put a good pair of gloves in the handy carrying bag...the plastic pair provided are a joke."
3,Jury is still out,"Just received a set and tried them on my 2005 Jaguar S-Type. STRONGLY recommend everyone try these before the snow flies; it took a good 10 minutes to get the first one on the car. I have a gravel driveway, and it was impossible to swing the half chain behind the tire, so I had to fashion a hook out of a coat hanger. It worked, but just barely; I'll try to fashion something more sturdy before I get caught trying to put these on some cold wet night on the road. It also was difficult making the first connection at the top of the tire. Hooking the rubber retainer was something best done with gloves and required some significant hand strength (although unhooking later was easier.) Lastly, remember where the first hookup (the one on the top back) was in relation to the tire, because when you remove them, it needs to be IN THE SAME POSITION so you can reach it and remove the chains. Net, they fit OK, but won't be fun on that cold dark night; have warm, flexible gloves on hand."
4,Fits my Mazda6 tires and doesn't cost a lot,"I have a Mazda6 with very little clearance around the wheel well, so regular tire chains don't work. I even tried the GoGlaws which are supposed to have a much slimmer profile without any luck. Someone on a Mazda forum suggested the Super Z6 and I went out and bought it on amazon. It fits my car, which I'm very pleased about. It's a little hard to put on, lots of tugging and pushing and this was just a dry run in my garage. Not had to use it on the roads yet. Still, given that this is the ONLY chain that fits a Mazda6, it's much better than nothing."
2,Damaged Trims,These were very easy to put on and take off my 2011 VW Jetta and the worked very well on the snowy/icy roads around Lake Tahoe. BUT they have scratched my wheel trims to pieces. I did not get these from Amazon but from a local dealer who has been using and selling these chains for a long time and who showed me how to put them on. I specifically asked him if I needed to take off the wheel trims in case of damage but he said there was no need. If you purchase these chains take off your wheel trims and instal caps before you put on the chains or risk having to replace your wheel trims.
5,"Even fits my ""unchainable"" acura type S","I was looking for chains for my 03 Acura TL-S and the vehicle owners manual said that because of the tight clearance, you should not chain up the type TL-S model. After researching this brand, I decided to give it a chance as the clearance required is much smaller than the DOT type ""S"" chain rating. I am very pleased with this product. It fits my vehicle even though there is a very tight clearance between the tire and the vehicle components. The cables seem to grip very well in the ice and snow. They are also very easy to put on compared to standard chains. I absolutely recommend them if you live in Colorado."
5,High quality and easy to install and remove,"I bought these chains for a rental for a recent trip to the snow. They fit the tire size as advertised, but always worth checking before getting to the snow. It took under 2 minutes per wheel to install and installation does NOT require you to move the vehicle. My trip was inside a national park which required chains despite the conditions not warranting them (I spent many years driving in Alaska with no chains in worse conditions). Despite driving over 100 miles on a mix of slush, snow and a lot of dry pavement, the chains held up well. The also store neatly in the included carrying bag. One item of note - pay attention to where the connection point on the inside of the tire is and try connecting disconnecting a few times when first installing to become familiar with the action."
4,Trailblazer SS,"Fit and went on good on 07 Trailblazer SS with 20"" factory rims and 265/50R20 tires. By far the easyiest ones I have ever used. No trouble installing in snow. Did not come in contact with rims, was close though."
2,Tire chains,Recived product fast but To large for the size chart the . Product will not stay on tire the size chart states it will fit 255/65/17 tires. had to reorder smaller SZ139 to fit 255/65/17 tires not even on the size chat for this set of chains. Great product design new size SZ139 fits well but size chart can be misleading.
2,damaged rims,"These cable chains are very easy to put on they also work very well in snow and icy conditions.We had a large snow storm in the Seattle area Jan 2012 ,used the chains for three days after removing them i discovered they scratched up my rims badly did not see in the instructions that this could happen.disappointed in product for this reason"
5,Great Cable Chains,"Not only did they get to me fast, they were extremely easy to put on and they fit my low-clearance wheel wells. No more struggling with chains for me!"
1,Bad sizing from the manufacturer,"SZ 139 for the Super Z6 do not fit P225/55/18 like they say. I am very dissapointed with this manufacturer. My tires are as common as they come, GOODYEAR EAGLE and the cables do not come even close to fit them. Another thing, these connectors are so poorely designed, just try to link one (from the exterior side of the tire and you will see). Very, very bad."
1,Absolutely will not fit 08 prius,"I bought these chains based on the good reviews and am sending them back. They absolutely did not fit my 08 prius, they were not even close. If you have a prius, I'd strongly recommend buying different chains."
1,Don't use on Toyota Prius Touring Edition,"These cables are a nightmare to install on a 2007 Toyota Prius Touring Edition. The cables simply seem too small. It took me about an hour to finally get these installed, and then, after just a few miles at 20 MPH, bam! One of the connectors came unhooked, and they got all tangled up inside the wheel. I had to call AAA for help getting the cables out of the wheel (this is really fun to do in the middle of a snow storm on the mountain pass), and now I have to take my car into the Toyota dealer to find out what all was damaged by this product. What a nightmare!"
1,Do not fit 285/35-19,"Hello,Just to let you know I bought them through Amazon and they did not fit the rear tires of my Corvette C6: 285/35-19. I have 3 sets of tires from different manufacturers (GoodYear high performance summer EMT, Avon Tech M440, Pirelli Sotto Zero) they didn't fit on any of them.Thankfully Amazon has an excellent return policy!Regards,Cedric"
4,Satisfied,"These were easy to install and provide great traction. However, the rubber band seems to lose its tension over a few days of use and I spun one chain off. I also noticed a chain of this brand at a stoplight on the road apparently also spun off. I reinforced with a few bungee cords on each wheel and haven't had any problems since."
5,Best found so far,"Easy to fit, not yet tried in poor conditions, but quick to install so hopefully will meet all expectations ."
1,I shoulda read the other review first!!!,"Ditto to ""What a disappointment."" A very long video with a stationary camera focused on two parrots sitting on a perch doing nothing you wouldn't see at a pet store if you walked past. I bought it for my parrot to watch, as he likes to see animal shows.This one did not really capture his attention. Siiiigh. Read those reviews before you buy!"
2,Not the same old jets,"I knew I was going to be disappointed when I saw the picture on the back of the case. Crow looks way to clean shaven. I was used to seeing the long haired lanky man reigning over his drum set. This is a big difference compared to the power of Safari's cover. Just like the picture, this is a much tamer version of the flat duo jets. The songs just don't have the same energy as the earlier material. And the many instruments and overdubs also detract from the overall quality. It is still a decent record, but far from the jet's best work. The raw edge which initially drew me to love Dex and Crow is completely gone here."
2,"Jets running out of gas, alas","Having been a Jets fan since their debut ten years ago, I have everything they've recorded. I was hoping ""Lucky Eye"" would find them reaching the produced heights of ""White Trees."" But with so many instrumentals, you can tell Dex and Crow are running out of gas. Dex has lost his edge. I have no problem with him being a one-trick-pony, but . . ."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"This book is so great. I just couldn't put it down. I took it to work with me and read it every chance I got. Those poor kids, it was so heartbreaking but yet it was a in your face drama that was so moving."
2,------,I must admit this was a very dry read. I only purchased the book because it involved ppl that I recently learned about. (my grandsons grandfather (buster)) I wanted to know what type of ppl they were. I really wish Ann was better at her deliver. I understand that it is Andre story but it took me almost a month to read. And the only reason I continued was out of pure curiosity.
3,Great story,Great story but towards the end it wraps up too quickly and the all is right with the world ending was a bit too sweet and happy for the subject matter. But the story was really interesting for sure
5,Absolutely Stunning,I was a big fan of Gomalan's first album -this one blows the first out of the water. Just listen to the first track and you'll see why these Italians are the world's hottest brass quintet.
4,"LOADS OF LAFFS, BURT AND LIZA LIGHT UP THE SCREEN","Although this movie ranks only one star or less as an action/thriller, it rates four stars as a comedy, albeit an unintentional one. Perfect for background atmosphere at your next fondue party. I loved it!"
1,liza and burt prove that when your down your down,"yet one more atempt by burt to breath some life into his dieing carrer,and the though that liza would help! WRONG!!! this is the bottom of the barrel movie about cops and pros(liza as a pro is just to funny)!!!! this is really just the worst!!!!"
5,great movie,i loved the story line and the chemistry between burt and lisa also james remar as the villian was brilliant and the action sequences were great
5,Wow! What a CD!,I've been Tim McGraw for several years now and this is one of his best cds. The songs are so great. He definitely has some #1 hits on his hands. I have so many favorites on this cd and you will too. If you are thinking about buying this cd you can't go wrong. This would make a excellent Christmas gift. Thanks Tim for all your wonderful cds. Keep bring us great music! Your #1 fan in PA! Love my Tim!!!!!!
1,Pure Hypocrisy,"How can this guy complain about the music currently being played on country radio when he IS one of the primary sources of the ""pop-country epidemic""? If that was a feeble attempt to draw in people who like their country music real, it failed miserably. Maybe he should try practicing what he preaches instead of trying to make a quick buck off of sappy, pop-laden songs.Oh, and by the way... why is McGraw catergorized as being a new traditionalist/outlaw according to amazon.com? I don't know what they've been listening to, but he's about as far from traditional/outlaw country as you can get. Get it right and catergorize him with the artificial bubblegum pop acts where he belongs."
2,Some Songs Are OK,"The fans who say this is TM's best album are going way too easy on him. I think they're so devoted to him that they'd buy a CD of him singing the phonebook. About half the songs are OK, the other half are second-rate. I like ""My Old Friend,"" ""Blank Sheet of Paper,"" ""Just Be Your Tear,"" ""Kill Myself,"" and ""Carry On."""
2,What have you people done with the Tim I remember?,"I have always been a big fan of Mr. McGraw, I must have listened to ""A Place in the Sun"" hundreds of times straight through. But unfortunately, since the ""greatest hits"" album, Tim has fallen off completely and this awful album is the last straw. Earlier reviewers must be listening to another album, no #1's here.In an effort to stick to safe material, a move that never fails to ruin the music, Tim has created another album full of formulaic ""soccer mom"" country with next to zero replay value. The songwriting is laughable, and the Dancehall Doctors should stick to the dancehall. I tacked on an extra star because I still have fond memories of ""All I Want"" and the earlier stuff (even when Tim had a mullet, at least he was still country). If you want real, innovative country, save your money and get you some Dwight Yoakam."
1,"Tim, what happend?","I absolutely love Tim McGraw and his music! I have ALL of his CDs and have loved every single one of them with the exception of his current CD. I have to ask, what happened? I was expecting this to be such a great CD since the last CD was my favorite of his so far...I was extrememly dissapointed and I could barely make it through all 16 tracks. I did give it a second listen and it didn't change my mind. I love the title track, it is an awesome song but the other tracks on the CD are extremely dissapointing. I can't wait for his next CD to come out, it has got to be better than this one!"
1,Stay away!,"I just bought this album, and what a mistake. The title track is an awesome piece of music, and I was hoping that Tim was getting back to the upbeat type of country that made him good when he first started recording.Bad assumption. The rest of this CD is absolutely terrible. The upbeat songs are unbearably slow, plodding along with all the energy of a sloth on nyquil. The lyrics are, almost without exception, simple, hokey, and unintelligent. Back When is perhaps the best example of this, but believe me, there are plenty of other tracks to provide competition.Bottom line - do NOT waste a penny on this miserable excuse for a country record. Maybe if his sales drop off, Tim will someday get back to recording quality music."
3,I'm dying here Tim!!!!!,The title track is the best on the entire cd. It is not the best material wise. The songs are boring. It is pretty mellow for lack of a better word. *yawn* Don't get me wrong. I love the old Tim hit songs and own all his cds. I was just let down and expected more from this cd than the last. The last cd was a real bust to. Much like Faith's cd. He needs pick out better songs and sing like he was dying-LOLTil next time time Tim!
2,Bland...boring...what happened Tim?,"I bought this CD expecting to like it a lot. And well needless to say, I struggled to listen to it once through. Compared to previous material, this is by far the most lackluster of anything Tim has done. There are no truly catchy singles. Every song seems to get more bland and lyrically trite as the CD progresses. Tim has had some amazing singles, but there are none to be found on this CD. I really like Tim and own several of his albums, but honestly I'm very disappointed with this one. It just doesn't live up to the standards his previous albums have set."
2,A Really Mixed Bag,"The CD's too long for its own good. I'd rather have six great songs than 16 mediocre ones. McGraw's quality control instincts took the week off here. The good songs are surrounded by maudlin or hokey tracks. For instance, a funny song is funny exactly once, and there's too many funny songs here, giving the whole effort a ""Hee-Haw"" feeling. Overall the ballads fare better than the country-rockers."
1,Stuck In A Rut,"I was really looking forward to this new CD, hoping with anticipation that I would hear some of the old magic of some of Tim's earlier career releases. This CD is full of carbon copy material of his last few outings. He is a multi-faceted artist, capable of so much, yet chooses to labor on depressing songs like, ""Kill Myself"", ""Drugs or Jesus"" and ""Open Season on My Heart"". There is only 1 song out of the 16 that I liked immediately, and that one is ""Just Be Your Tear"". I prefer to look back and listen to what I think is one of his best projects, ""All I Want"". That CD is full of great songs. C'mon Tim, make the next one an upbeat, danceable CD, one that just explodes with your true talent!"
2,Not Up to Par Compared To His Other Albums,"Besides ""My Old Friend"" and ""Live Like You Were Dying"" the songs all sound the same. This album doesn't have any kick to it, like his others. It's all a bunch of soft slow songs."
2,"Sadly, not his best.","I am a HUGE Tim McGraw fan, especially of his early stuff. I consider, All I Want, Place in the Sun and Everywhere to be three of the finest albumns anyone has ever done. So needless to say, I had Tim McGraw's new one in my CD player early the morning it came out.I gave it a good try, listening through it at least 5 times through and I am sadly dissappointed. There are good songs...I liked My Old Friend and Walk Like a Man. There are even great ones, like the title track, Live like you were Dying, but it just did not kick (...) from start to finish.Tim's other albumns sit in my CD player and every song is fantastic. This one is not the case. In fact, there were actually songs that I don't like and will now skip over. That has never happened with a Tim McGraw CD for me.I give it a positive review, but I don't consider this Tim's best stuff. McGraw fans need to own it for their collection, but I am not sure it is worth getting just to get the title song."
4,Good album,"This is a fairly solid album from Tim McGraw, who in my opinion keeps coming out with great albums, one after another. The title track is probably the biggest hit on country radio this year, a touching song about appreciating life and living it to it's fullest. I'll admit, I don't care for the uptempo stuff as much, such as ""How Bad Do You Want It"", and ""Back When"" (his newest hits), but the ballads are truly remarkable. With 16 tracks there is bound to be a bit of filler, but luckily there isn't much. Some highlights include ""Blank Sheet of Paper"", ""Old Town New"", ""Drugs Or Jesus"", ""We Carry On"", ""Kill Myself"" and others."
5,Great job Tim!,I love the way Tim's music has evolved! He brings so much of his life into his music and gives it a lot more meaning. I have been a HUGE fan of his since 1994 and I think his music just keeps getting better! I think it shows how he has matured as a person and as an artist! I hope he just keeps creating these amazing albums. There isn't one that I don't like! I think in all his albums he shows both his fun side and his serious side and I love the combination! He is also a great entertainer and the Dance Hall Doctors are amazing! If you get the chance go see him live its well worth the money!!! As was this CD!
1,I have heard better Music By him,"I am really displeased , i have all the Cd's he has put out But this is one I will not be rushing to buy , not to mention purchasing it , Woudl make my taste for his music very unpleaseant"
1,Foul,"Tim Mcgraw is horrible, he has absolutely no talent what so ever he pays someone tons of money to write his lyrics (which he sings like crap), he can't play any real instrument( maybe a tambourine), he sounds like everyone else on a country music station( no originality), and his music is filled with drug references, violence against women, and bad language."
1,He can't sing,"I have nothing against Tim McGraw as a person. He's a nice looking bloke and he seems to be a nice person. That said, the guy can't sing. He sounds as bad as Nelly does in the song ""Over and Over"". I can sing better than McGraw and that's not saying much. I'm not going to criticise McGraw's lyrics because most country songs are drenched with hilarious lyrics worse than anything Justin Timberlake can muster in his tiny brain. Tim McGraw should step over and let people with real talent hog the spotlight!"
2,Dissappointed,"I liked the music.... but the lyrics were not up to par. Most of the songs had bad rhymes, simple rhymes. My sister could have written better songs and shes 10. A couple songs like Live like you were dying, We carry on, and let me be your tear were the only songs that i enjoyed. This CD sounded too down beat for Mcgraw. It just didnt sound like a Tim Mcgraw CD. I was definitaley dissappointed with the quality of songs compared to his last CDs. I didnt like how he wrote about OTHER people and not himself, like in everyone hates me and do you want fries with that. I miss the old, romatic songs of Tim Mcgraw."
2,Really Depressing Album,"I am a huge Tim McGraw fan and think he is fabulous in concert. I loved his other albums, but I have to say that this album is just depressing. I have only listened to it once and can't get myself to listen to it again. I wish I had heard the album before I bought it. The title track is the best one on the whole album, besides that there is only one, maybe two others worth listening to. I hope Tim's next album is more upbeat!"
1,what has happened to tim? very poor album!!,"i have to say im a huge tim mcgraw fan, and i was waiting all summer for this cd! i have to say i am very disappointed in this cd, all the songs are boring and very dull, and the lyics are very corny, i had to skip thru most of the songs, i do have to say dont waste your money on this cd, it is not worth it at all.save your money for tims next cd, maybe it will be the old tim back!!or you can buy my tim cd on ebay!!"
1,PURE GARBAGE!!,"I saw Tim in concert this summer and loved every minute of the show. I couldn't wait to get this album. Wow...what a waste of time and money. The title track is exceptional and that's where he earned his one star. The rest is boring, formulaic, and highly forgettable. McGraw is known, in the past, for his ability to select hit songs. There is not a song on this CD that I could hum even if Faith Hill held a gun to my head. He needs to kick it up a notch and get the ""hitch out of his git-a-long"". Fun, danceable music is what the country needs right now, especially right now. Not depressing songs that drone on and say nothing."
5,McGraw's best work yet!,"On first listen, this cd can be considered somewhat of a downer. After repeated listenings, however, you hear just how good these songs really are. All tell a story that everybody can relate to on some level. The songs are beautifully crafted and very moving. Tim's voice and the band has never sounded better. Lucky for us, Tim McGraw has the ear and the clout to record songs such as these, some of which may never have seen the light of day. ENJOY!"
3,A long time Tim fan not impressed here...,"I am giving this album by Tim 3 stars. I consider that a terrible rating. Normally, I would give him 5 because I love him, and think he's a great artist, but this album left me really disappointed. I loved ""Lived Like You Were Dying"" and enjoyed ""My Old Friend"" and the upbeat ""Everyone Hates Me"" but other than that, there's nothing on this CD I care to listen to. It has more of a rock feel to it than country which is fine that he is trying to branch out (and it seems that way on his past couple albums as well) but on this album it's not working for me. I really feel terrible saying that, but this wouldn't be an honest review if I didn't.If you're a new fan of Tim, stick with his earlier albums such as ""Set This Cicus Down,"" ""Place in the Sun"" or ""Everywhere."" They are all fantastic. Hope this review helps!"
2,CD stops in mid-play,I paid a low price and apparently got an inferior product. It plays for a while and stops. Not worth trying to send it back for a refund because the postage exceeds the price of the album.
3,This album is a very maudlin downer,"Now that I've listened to all 16 tracks, I can't help but feel like this is a step back for Tim McGraw. He touches on some very heavy subjects that seem to overshadow the more lighthearted moments on the disc. Just listen to the titles of some of the songs - Drugs or Jesus, Something's Broken, Everybody Hates Me, and one of the most depressing songs I've ever heard - Kill Myself. The disc needed more country-rock crowd pleasers in the vein of ""I Like It, I Love It"". I don't see how he'll be able to tour and keep a crowd rocking with the majority of the material on this album. That's not to say that this album is total garbage. Do You Want Fries With That is a very funny (and fun) song. The title cut, Live Like You Were Dying, is worth the price of admission alone. Its one of the most inspirational songs you'll ever hear and it really seems out of place on a disc full of downers."
2,WORST TIM MCGRAW CD EVER,"VERY DULL AND MORE SOMBER THAN ANY TIM MCGRAW ALBUM FROM THE PAST. VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE CD. MONEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SPENT ON SOMETHING ELSE. MY WIFE AND MYSELF ARE BIG TIM MCGRAW FANS BUT THIS CD LEAVES A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH. ONLY 2 SONGS WERE WORTH MY MONEY ""LIVE LIKE YOU WERE DYING"" AND ""BLANK SHEET OF PAPER"". OTHERWISE I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM."
1,Tug McGraw's Son STIKES OUT!!,"This CD was such a waste of money. I wish I'd heard it before I purchased it. Only the title track was good...what a waste!Tim seems to have lost his Midas Touch. He needs to start writing more of his own music and stop relying on others to pass along his message!BORING, BORING, BORING!Don't bother....this is a real slop collection! C'mon Tim...thrill us with some talent, would ya?!? I might consider a collection of ""The Best Of"" from Tim....but I doubt I'll spend my hard earned cash on anything else from him again."
1,Formula Updated Garth Brooks,Tim Mcgraw is just carrrying on what Garth Brooks Started.Cross-Over Country with Pop sensiblitys&He is good at it sometimes but nothing here shows any Growth as a Artist whatsoever. just like His Wife Faith Hill so Formula driven that you forget about there Albums after a Couple of songs. Quiet as it's kept Faith&Tim are everything that Jessica Simpson&Nick Lachay wish they were. Mcgraw been pulling the Musical wool over folks's eyes just as Faith Hill has been with the Super than Slick Production with generic songwriting results.
5,"Dis dude fo' realz, dogg","On da realz, my boy Timmy Mickey G is bad as all git-out when it comes to real country musik. He did dat collaborashun wit' an R&B; dude who bad as all git-out 2.I ain't never really hurd 2 much country musik befo' I hurd my boy T-G Mickey G, but I likes hiz stile of singing a lot, cuz he believez in singing about yor dreamz and keepin' stuff real.

But it ain't matter to me. Thanx for makin' me the # one reviewer on Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!Wish me a good retirement...PEAZE OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,time mcgraw,"He sings like he looks beautiful and so loving, i would recommend this to anyone who loves this sultry sounding hip bumping music"
3,Not My Favorite Tim Album,"I have been a huge fan of Tim McGraw since his Everywhere CD. However, his last 2 albums have been lacking the must listen to experience. They are missing the essential country part of Tim and have become too main stream without soul. There is only one song on this CD that sticks with you and that you want to hear over and over again, that is Live Like You Were Dying. The rest of the CD is okay but nothing that I have to listen to everyday.I listed to Everywhere and Set This Circus down continually for months after I purchased them. I have listened to this CD a few times but it still does not connect."
2,Not enough,"I don't know, I think the last album had a better selection of songs. The title track is the only song I think is really awesome, the melodies aren't all that strong in most of the other 15 songs, except for perhaps ""Blank sheet of paper"" and ""My old friend"". But songs like ""We carry on"" ""Drugs or Jesus"" may hit closer to home for some people than it did for me. That still doesn't make it a great song though. With a bigger-than-life-kind of song and single like ""Live like you were dying"" I was really expecting a lot more from this album."
3,It was okay.,Some of the lyrics are a little far out there. very different from some of his other albums.
4,Fun start to a new series!,"After Jane Smith quits her boring accounting job, she takes a spot with a local Denver rag, the Daily Orion...her new persona-Stella the Stargazer, giving advice and horoscopes to the unhappy and lovelorn. Within a short period of time, she's already the chief suspect in a murder investigation, which also involves a number of near-and-dear friends of hers. 'A Love to Die For' is the first in the Stella the Stargazer series and I was pleasantly surprised. It's a quick, light read with all the elements one hopes for in a cozy. Unusual characters, witty prose, and most of all, a juicy murder (or two)... I haven't read the other books in this series yet, but am certainly looking forward to! If you're in the market for a nice, easy read, give Stella a try. Her pet, Fluffy, is a chameleon she keeps on a tiny leash in her breast pocket....now HOW can this NOT be a fun read?"
2,A Classy Lady's Non-Classy Memoirs,"Helen Hayes whose life story would be fascinating to all fans of Broadway and/or Hollywood pretty much squanders this effort by traducing a large assortment of individuals. What makes this badmouthing all the more unpleasant is the fact that most of her targets were deceased at the time of its publication and unable to present their side of the story.While the recurring instances of charcter assasination are the book's biggest liability, the First Lady of the American Theater also comes off as somewhat self-centered and shallow.Those who respect the many noble actions which typified Helen Hayes' final decades will be disappointed and likely disturbed by this autobiography that does not do her memory justice."
3,great for a while,"My 3 yo had one of these, and his old one broke, so we bought this. It lasted for about a year. Works great, he loved it. When it broke, of course we had to get a new one. However, I had to end up buying a new one and throwing this away because even though it looks like you can tkae the bulb out and just put in a new one, I couldn't figure it out. I wish these things were easier to figure out so they didn't all have to end up in the landfill."
1,bad services,"it showed was send out yesterday and even with a track number, suddenly received a email said it was not in the warehouse. 11 of 13 items I ordered were not available? why this company still have them on the amazon? I had to run to staple to get all of them.Very disappointed, will never order from this company again."
3,bbfrmbflo,nice acoustic sound. easy listening. i would probably buy another cd from this artist. a little Jimmy Buffet like.
2,"Save your money, read this review:","If his own principles had been applied to the book it could be reduced to a a few bullet points.*the web is slow, less is more.*tell people what a link leads too before they press it, and make sure it does.*use standard fonts in easy to read colours.*use standard web conventions where ever possible as they are familiar.*check for spelling mistakes and grammar errors.*write concisely and arrange depth of detail in hierarchies, like they do in errr reference books.*tell the user where they are, and how they got their, um like a path prehaps.*some people have small screens, some don't even use microsoft browsers, not everyone has the latest plug ins, allow for it.*don't employ frustrated artists to design your site, use an engineer.Jakob proudly states he has multiple patents in the field of usability, maybe following this book will infringe them, or maybe he just kept the good stuff for himself."
2,Overly wordy.,"Although Neilsen has a lot of good information in here, the information is hidden beneath layers of writing. Every point is repeated several times, and the author is incredibly wordy. As a professional writer, it astounds me that someone could go on about usability without having the faintest idea of how to make his own writing usable. If edited properly, this volume could be reduced to half the size and give exactly the same information. The passive voice just about slaughters this book. One gets the impression that the author thinks he must write in this boring, textbook style in order to be considered ""The Book"" in the industry. This is unfortunate, because many readers simply won't make it through this book, despite the important information it has to impart."
5,This video helped end Communism!,"A satirical look at politics, its humor comes from its closeness to actual campaigns. As Pat says, ""Just change a few names and the same thing is going on today."" Narrated by Henry Fonda, this highly acclaimed TV show will keep you laughing. (This video was one of three American TV shows taken by a Russian delegation back to Russia in 1972. Nobody knows why, but pat assumed this contributed to the fall of Communism.)"
3,A good read,"Cherryh sets the book in old Russia and explores the old admonition, ""Be careful what you wish for. You may get it."" The characters spend much time worrying over unintended consequences of disturbing nature and run afoul of situations and villains as a result. Their indecision is often painful to them and readers alike. The characters are well developed and the story interesting. My only regret is that I can read faster than she writes."
1,not good brute is better,my first online cologne buy..dont do it smell is weak and doesnt last wish i saved my money and got cologne from outlet near home...
3,"diamond great, pearl disappointing","The diamond was beautiful, but the pearl's surface was not ""clean."" Imperfections were visible if standing next to someone wearing it. It's odd that the quality of hte pearl was not great, while the diamond was very good quality. Not a great pairing. I returned it."
4,A Glimpse of Reality (More or Less),"I picked up this book after reading the reviews written about it on this very page. I wasn't disappointed.It was refreshing to find a writer who wrote about a story about a police detective who happens to be a lesbian, rather than a lesbian who happens to be a police detective. The mystery is compelling, the characters are well written, and the descriptions paint a vivid picture of a city and its inhabitants."
3,Not as interesting as other books in the series,"There are about 5 or 6 books in this series and if you get them oujt of sinc it's too bad. This one is not as well written I thought. Again a fast read, but a bit boring. See other reviews that I've written about this True North series."
2,needs remixing,This sounds like it was recorded and mixed in someone's garage.There also were no liner notes and pictures.Save your money for another Asia cd.
5,Great Learning tool,This was a required text for my degree but has proven to be a go to tool and reference book.
2,Not as good as their BATMAN Trilogy,This recording lacks the power of the Royal Scottish's powerful Batman Trilogy. That was an epic recording.
3,Just Average,"Arthouse classics or not, I have listened to better recordings of these works. This is a bit of a let-down from John Debney's previous work. Sorry to say it, but these recordings are just average. The recordings are just too matter-of-fact."
1,What gives?,I just recieved this game today and I am already yelling at it and it is probably going to be on its way back shortly. When I go to create my horse after getting my rider..I get up to the adjust horse stats screen and can go no further...If I go back then nothing gets saved. Am I just a moron who cant figure this out or is there something wrong with it? I looked in the booklet and have been searching online for almost an hour now
5,Great Game,"Purchased for my 10 year old daughter who takes English riding lessons. She loves the game. Her first reaction when she started to play was ""Mom, it's so real"". She has no complaints about the game execpt when I tell her she has been playing long enough, now go outside for awhile!"
5,AWSUM the best ever!,I love this game i had 1 be4 but i over used it so i bought a new one the shipping didnt take long and its the best horse game ever all other r nothing compared to this one.
5,The Best,"This was a great game! It is not jest a girl game, you can have a male chracter. That was a great , concitering i am a male. the only thing that was not so god was when it cantered, it was on the wrong lead... that relly bugged me. In all, every thing was good"
2,"Good graphics, boring game","I purchased this game a while ago because I love horse games. From the description, and screen shots, it looked like a fun game. I was disappointed to see that you really have no freedom in the game. You can't walk around the barn or outside, like I thought. There is a menu where you choose what event you want to do, or which horse you want to ride. That's as intricate as it gets! Riding in the events are pretty fun: again, there are really good graphics. I wouldn't recommend this game if you like exciting games."
4,my review,"This book is the story of a man who wins back his fortune and life from very difficult circumstances. He faces incredible storms and temperatures to salvage a boat with passengers off the coast of Antartica. He next saves an oil tanker who is also carrying his ex-wife and son.As usual, Wilbur Smith writes in excesive detail, but makes every scene, every place and situation seems very real. The characters are also very life-like and you warm up to them imediately.If there was anything I could say against this book, it would be that the author seems to spend too much time describing every scene during the storms and salvages, when it is hard to follow because it gets very technical. Also, the ending is a little disappointing because after he has warmed you up to his ex-wife and son you are left not knowing what happens to them.However, it is overall a very good book and always a pleasure to read a book that is entertaining, alive and written in such a complete way."
2,Disappointing After 50 pages!,"I actually never finished this one. Came recommended to me by a tug boat captain who started it while waiting for a dredge to fill up his hopper barge. I know how boring it can be steaming to and from the dumping grounds, especially at two knots, but a person would have to be lost on a deserted island to find this book even the slightest bit captivating. It starts out interesting enough, with some high stakes backstory about a captain going out on a financial limb to start his own salvage business, but it quickly degenerates into a cheap Hollywood actioner, complete with plastic characters and a forced romance to boot, which happens as soon as the main character reaches the antarctic to rescue a stricken cruise ship. If you ask me, you're better off with Jan De Hartog, Farley Mowatt, Joseph Conrad, Jack London, and for more contemporary sea fare, David Poyer."
2,A bit much,"I bought this thinking it would be a sea story, which it was, but it was an Arnold Swarzenega (?) teenager's fantasy, of unremitting action, busty slender beauties (two), covered with apparently real knowledge of marine salvage. A bit too contrived."
5,Edge of your seat!,"Thrilling novel filled with twists and turns, describing the rise & fall of the characters to the very end, thoroughly recommend!"
2,What happened to the ending??,"The first part of this book is mesmorizing, I couldn't put it down. However, after the first big adventure, the story rapidly deteriorates. The ending was a HUGE disappointment. It felt like Wilbur Smith got bored with writing and stopped one or two chapters short of finishing. It is a shame as this book had great potential."
5,Hungry as the Sea,Once again Wilbur Smith has written a tail of intrigue and heroic determination. From icy waters to the warmth of the tropics your attention to this story is not neglected.
2,An Average Read. Not WOW!,I read 'The eye of the tiger' and enjoyed it thoroughly. I was looking for something similar.This ones average but nice.Are there better books to get? Definitely.
2,Hardest book I have ever read.,"From the late 1700s to the mid 1800s, Western and central Europe put forth several major works of literature that examined the relationship between men, and between men and society. These include On Liberty by J. S. Mill, Leviathan by T. Hobbes, Capital by K. Marx, and The Social Contract by Frenchman Jean Jacques Rousseau. This book examines the origins, nature, logic, and inner workings of relationships between three entities. These entities are man the individual, men as in a collection of individuals, and the state, where the state includes laws, government, and other institutions. I first read this book in a high school class. I tried to read it later when in college. I could not finish this book either time; this is the most difficult book I have ever read. Unlike other discourses on politics, this book is heavily influenced by philosophy, and written like a text in philosophy. I would not recommend it for any but the most determined reader."
2,Romanticism is dead... Long live Romanticism!,"200 years can't make a bad idea good. (Heck, Christianity has proved that 1700 years can't make a bad idea good) Rousseau bogs himself down in the same contradiction that has plagued all followers of the right hand path- the fact that there is no ""great return"" destroys his entire thesis. Skip this guy- read Thomas Hobbes, Nicolo Machiavelli, or Friedrich Nietzsche. They were political philosophers. Rousseau was just a sophist."
3,1984 Anyone?,"I picked up a copy of this book in a shop in Hong Kong with high expectations. I had heard of it but had not yet read it and was rather shocked to find an english language copy in a place like Hong Kong. It is very persuasive in some of it's arguments but is essentially little more than a book advocating totalitarian government systems and as I read it I couldn't help but wonder if the former Texas governer had a member of his staff read it to him sometime during his recent administration.Aside from a few clever quotations and a few speechlike chapters this book is little more than a more elegant political pundit book. It proves little more than one Ann Coulter or Rush Limbaugh would reason if they had a stronger command of the English language. One difference would be that Rousseau believed, at least in some parts of the book, that religion weakened government."
4,Great Intellectual,"Jean Jacques Rousseau is truly a great intellectual.His Discourses and The Social Contract are some of the best in Enlightenment thinking. In the Discourses Rousseau exalts the ""noble"" savage free from the corrupting influence of modern civilization. He believes that civilization has corrupted man from his original, yet ignorant state. I found the Discourses to be a little flighty and unrealistic. The Social Contract was a different story altogether. This is a monumental work. In it Rousseau shows his vast knowledge of the Roman Republic and Empire and the reasons for it's rise and collapse. Rousseau also denounces monarchy and aristocracy as forms of government and exalts republicanism. He also decries the power of organized religion in the oppression of mankind. With his ""General Will"" theory of the social contract he shows true brilliance. A great buy."
2,Alexis de Tocqueville's Nemesis,"'The tyranny of the majority' - a brilliant phrase coined by the author of 'Democracy In America' and a brilliant chink in the armour of Rousseau's societal vision. An individual who owes everything to the state cannot conceivably be called an 'individual.' They are, rather, reduced to being an automated cog in the wheel of human motion. Their very individuality is subsumed to serve the will of the collective. This cannot be right. Minorities must be protected. If not, they will find a way. However, I agree, as Orwell did, that there must be a rejection of 'every form of man's dominion over man.' We are equal but different. This paradox resists neat hyperbole."
3,A thunderstorm that clears the air...but passes...,"Rousseau's ""Contract Social"" has originated many false beliefs that are, though sometimes unwittingly, still even entertained today, such as the ""Noble Savage"", the originary state of the individual (allegedly in a condition of primordial solitude and self-relaince), a social bond or contract (the historicity of which is extremely suspect) by which separate individuals agree to form a social union (a society or polity) and the gross fallacy of the innate goodness of man. This work, the product of a morbidly paranoid Genevan who had the callousness and audacity to leave his five children abandoned in an orphanage, owes its impact mainly to the fire of its eloquence rather than to any of its ideas, which are of no lasting merit. Like a thunderstorm, it cleared the air, only to pass..."
3,A Classic,"This goes a long way to helping us understand how to fit into a society while also seeking own individual will. An important work for social scientists, philosophers, and humankind more generally."
5,Great!,"Made this cake for my son's 3rd birthday party, and it was a great hit! very easy to use, and will use again in the future"
4,"Product as described on Wilton website, but a little hard to actually bake in it.","Got this for a gift & she & children were so happy to receive it. However, as her email replied after her first effort ""yellow cake didn't work"". Wilton recommends pound cake batter for these so I'm searching for my old recipe now (makes a much stiffer batter). This was the best price on the internet so it is a fun experiment to continue:)"
3,Wilton 3D cake pan,"My son is crazy about trains and I have made other types of train cakes in the past. I bought this 3D cake pan because the finished product looked so cute, in pictures. Well, I followed the directions exactly, used pound cake mix as recommended, and I've been waiting for this cake to be fully cooked for over 2 hours! The hole in the pan that you are supposed to use to test if it's done is useless. It appeared to be done, but when I took the bottom cover off the cake there was raw mix still there. So I put it in oven again, and again, then without one of the sides on thinking it'll cook faster. Nope. I really hope this works out because it's a cute idea! Just be prepared to bake this thing for a while!!"
4,Train Cake,The pan worked great - only downfall (for me) was that I did not realize the cake would be so small (only took one box of cake mix). I guess I definately was expecting it to be bigger - and when using this pan DEFINATELY use a pound cake recipe - tried regular white cake and the cake fell over - not dense enough.
3,Not as good as other wilton pans,"I purchased this pan for my daughters second birthday cake. Last year I bought the giant cupcake pan and that was very easy to use! Not so much with this pan! Its the night before my daughters party and I am on my second train cake, using a wilton recipe, and the darn thing is not cooking as directed! the silly inadequate instructions that came inside the pan turned out to not be the same ones on the wilton website. Looks like Im going to have to bake a 3rd one tonight, and Im not thrilled. I am an experienced baker, and this is ridiculous! If you buy this pan make sure you use these instructions [...] not the one in the pan!"
4,So cute,Definitely read the directions first- I used the wrong batter and the wrong amount so it didn't stand up. I still used it and the cake turned out so cute.
2,Less Talk More Action,"When the DVD finally arrived at the workout it was a good one. I would have kept this workout if it had more workout and less ""motivational"" mumbo jumbo. Now it is in the charity bin!"
2,not very good choregraphy,"the ballet and yoga section is ok, as for the dance section their choregraphy is terrible some of the moves are ridiculous. Don't buy if you are interested in the dance part."
5,ybb-complete workout,"It's not the first product of this kind purchased by me,but because I have some others at home,I've decided to enlarge my personal library.And I'm very glad with the results.The workout is purely complete,you don't need anything else for seeing real results.Keep doing it and you'll get better.The touch of yoga is the cream on top and this makes it mor.e special.Buy it and you'll see the magic in it."
3,hmmmmm...abs ok,"Well, actually this is my first amazon review ever :) I got this dvd from my local library and just finished the abs section. I am a pretty fit person and I feel that some of the moves are good while others really don't seem too helpful. It just didn't quite take me to the next level. So if you are in pretty good shape and have done intermediate core workouts before, this one is an ok addition for a lighter workout."
3,A boring performance. No energy coming from Jack or Robin.,"I love Jack Bruce and Robin Trower but this is not a good performance.I like their CD of this band project, but the live performance made me nod off.Jack and Robin are just getting too old to give a live ""Rock"" performance.Audibly their work is still good, but I do not see the reason for a live concert orlive DVD video."
5,Restores a sense of control of your own destiny,"I cannot say enough about this book. After being diagnosed I felt completely terrified and powerless. This book walks you through things you can do to ensure you receive the best treatment possible. Full of great facts about scleroderma that my doctor either didn't know or just didn't tell me. Really stresses the fact that you must be your own advocate and that is a great impetus to get out of bed and do everything you can. Emotionally supportive, just a wonderful book (that came for me at exactly the right time)."
3,"Sad, but no fault of Ayn Rand or Objectivism","Blaming Ayn Rand or her philosophy, Objectivism, for the misdeeds of Dr. Lonnie Leonard, is like blaming Jesus, or his philosophy, Christianity, for the misdeeds of Christian serial killer Robert Yates (which, by the way, were a lot worse than those of Leonard).The other reviewers claim that adherence to Objectivism MUST lead to the behavior exhibited by Lonnie Leonard, but they fail to explain why most Objectivists (including many mental healthcare professionals) DON'T behave that way. The fact is that Lonnie Leonard pretended to be an Objectivist, and he fooled a lot of people (including some real Objectivists) into thinking that he was. Being an Objectivist (or practicing any other philosophy) is no guarantor against being fooled by a clever fraud."
3,some harm done,"This Inspector Wexford mystery is definitely not Rendell's best. I have read most of her novels and there are only a few that are not absolute masterpieces. This one had too much social commmentary for me and a ""red herring"" that took up 3/4 of the book made me feel deflated. And why was there a pedophile theme in the middle that had nothing to do with the plot? If this book is your first encounter with Wexford, please don't give up on Rendell. She's an author well worth reading. This just isn't one of her best books. Harm Done just didn't contain many of the elements fans read the Wexford series for."
3,No Harm Done reading this book,"But no great thrills either. I guess it was my bad luck to be reading by coincidence four thrillers involving young female abductions and/or killings. So while reading HARM DONE, I was quite sick of the theme. The spousal abuse was an interesting theme. The missing girls and who was taking them was a disappointing subplot. Cute little surprise twist at the end."
1,The biggest disappointment yet,"If there is ever a place where the political correctness does not belong, it's mystery. Ruth Rendell has sold out to the PC crowd - the book is bland and preachy. I think the damage is irreversible, at least for me. Mystery will never be the same."
1,very disappointed,"The Inspector Wexford series is one of my favorites. Rendell is at her best with this character. I was hungry for a mystery and bought it in hardback as soon as it appeared on the shelves and was glad to see how long it was. High expectation added to disappoinment. I agree with the other reviewers who found the book disappointing, politically correct, overwritten, and tedious. I would add that Inspector Wexford is not himself in No Harm Done-- readers who have not read any of the other Wexford mysteries will be pleasantly surprised to find a richer and less moralistic character. Don't give up because of No Harm Done."
2,full text or abridged?!,"I was unpleasantly surprised to discover that the audio CD of Harm Done I recently bought turned out to be an abridged version. I was wonderng why it seemed to include a lot less detail than I recalled from reading the book a few years ago. A clue to do with knives--which emphasized the book's themes--simply wasn't there, for example.I don't see mention of abridged vs. entire story (unabridged) on the descriptions of this product that are currently online."
2,Disappointing,"I've read one other Rendell book and enjoyed it. However, this one left me disappointed. As several other reviewers noted, the three plot lines about the abductions of two young girls, the pedophile and the wife beater never come together. I also felt both the social commentary and characters were shallow. The book would have been better if one or more of the plot lines were dropped and the remaining plot lines followed in greater depth."
3,Another shoddy job from MILL CREEK!,"I should have looked closer at the distributor. Mill Creek has earned a reputation for putting out shoddy, slapshot work....and this is no exception. First off, the movies are labeled wrong. ""Heartbreak Hotel"" is on the side listed for ""Indian Summer"", and vice versa. Second, the box states that ""Heartbreak Hotel"" is in 1:78, which I was really looking forward to since I've only ever been able to get it in 1:33. Well, the actual image on the DVD is 1:33. At least they got ""Indian Summer"" right in the 2:35 that it's listed as being.I only give it 3 stars because I like both movies."
1,HAD FRIENDS DO 5 STARS! MINE IS IN TRASH CAN,"This book came out and vast numbers were asked to write a positive review.I bought the book, and have since literally thrown it away. No one reading what is out now could possibly find this to be a book with any staying power. It will drift slowly and surely to the back of this topic list due to useless medicial information, that some college freshman Lyme and tick infection patients know better. These non-physicians actually think they know better then real life treatment leaders and emerging thought leaders nationally and internationally. Are they sober? What arrogance!And as to the stories of bad medicine..... Welcome to the modern world. We will be lucky if any good MD's are around in 25 years.You were smart to get all your pals to write reviews. The book is trash."
1,THE WORST LYME BOOK NOW IN PRINT,Lyme disease and its co-infections is supposedly strength of this book. Yet is clear neither author knows anything of serious use in advanced Lyme care and as to co-infections -- Forget about it!Virtually every book in print is better than this poorly written junk. I know the authors told all their contacts to write a review because the US Constitution does not get this many PERFECT ratings. Get real.
5,Touching!,"I had no idea that Lyme Disease was as much of a problem-- nor was it such a great controversy and cause of human heartbreak-- until I read this book. The stories of patients from every walk of life and their struggles for treatment broke my heart. I would urge anyone who does not know about the Lyme Disease issue, or perhaps even those who are involved in it and seeking some hope, to read this powerful story."
2,"Works pretty good, WHEN IT WORKS!","I actually like the product, it works very well..BUT it has major overheating issues (my best guess). I get about an hour of operation from a cold start then it cuts out and I get the static/snow screen on my tv. If I let it cool for a couple hours I get another hour out of it. Maybe I just got a defective item...I hope so, atleast I can return it and get another."
5,Remote control extender,"Like some of the other folks, I was able to get an excellent audio/visual signal. However, the remote control extender which had been working fine became unstable and only worked intermittently. After talking with the tech, I realized that the problem was with the orientation of the two UHF antennas (the two short stick antennas). They both need to be at 90 degrees to the line between the transmitter and the receiver -- this is actually mentioned in the manual, but I didn't realize the extender was so sensitive to the orientation. I had probably bumped one of these antennas out of alignment. After readjusting the two stick antennas, I no longer have a problem with the remote control extender, and everything works great."
5,Great Product and a Good Value,"I wanted a second TV connected to my satellite dish. My home is not wired for cable and I didn't want to go to the effort. I saw plenty of cheaper units out there, but their poor reviews turned me off. This unit was twice the cost but the good reviews intrigued me. I took a chance and bought it and cannot be more pleased. It works great ! One caveat, though. It was my intent to hook the receiver to an older color tv. This unit doesn't possess an rf modulator output. IE, it doesn't wire into the cable jack on the tv. It only wires to RCA jacks. I had to purchase a channel 3 modulator at RS for $15 to wire between my tv and this device. Most newer TVs will have RCA inputs and this shouldn't be a problem - just something to be aware of."
4,Great product but Remote is Issue,"We have 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, an 802.11g wireless LAN (WiFi). I had bought the Terk model that was 2.4Ghz but that had so much interference it was unusable. I searched out this one (the only 5.8Ghz on the market I could find) and it works awsome!! Video/audio is perfect on my HD TV, not as perfect as HD but not bad. However..I'm baffled by the IR remote extender. I hook it up, it works perfectly. 2 days later, it doesn't work at all. Later that night, it works perfectly. I thought it was something in the room where the actual DVR device was that was interfereing and moved stuff off the table and couch, it worked. Then went to work, didn't move anything when I got home and it didn't. I'm very baffled on what is blocking the signal sometimes and not others. Other than the remote...it works awsome. Exactly what I wanted. Just really really need the remote to work 100% of time."
1,Was the situation corrected?,I wanted to buy this item (since the 2.4MHZ item of the same kind did not work at my place due to all the interferences) but the previus review stopped me. I wonder if the previous reviewer's situation was corrected by amazon.com in that they sent the right item. I could not find the direct email of the previous reviewer to ask directly.
4,pleased with the picture quality,"I am using this to feed video to an LCD projector. I was afraid that the picture quality would suffer, but no worries. It looks great. Vibrant colors and no noise. I am not using the audio, so I cannot comment on that.One complaint, though. If you are in the habit of using premium cables you're out of luck here. The plastic molding on the external case of these units is so close to the outside of the RCA jacks that there is no room for the thicker connectors found on high-end cables. The unit comes with two video / audio cables of the standard variety, and they fit fine. I wish I could use premium cables."
4,Great Product!,"Highly recommended. Works great, no interference, VERY EASY TO INSTALL (took 5 minutes). This is a great product. I only have 1 cable line in my house, but can now watch TV and control the cable box from my bedroom. This is a great solution - especially if you are renting and are not able to have additional cable lines installed. I am very happy with the picture quality and control capabilities. My next project is to split the cable and add another box in the living room so that I can control a seperate box. I'd like to be able to find additional recievers so that TVs in other areas of the house (kitchen and garage, etc) can also be connected. If you are thinking of Wireless AV, this is the way to go."
4,Works great!,"I have to concur with the other reviews here. I would have given this product 5 stars had it not been for the static that occurs when someone walks in between the two antennas. This does come with the transmitter and receiver. I have had these for over 6 months and I am very happy with the results. Recently we have had to move to an apartment while our new home is being built and I have had a little more interference. One strange thing, the transmitter on Ch3 and receiver on ch2; shouldn't work but it does. Thanks for reading my 2 cents.UPDATE: Just sent this off to manufacturer, they said they would check the whole ""wrong channel"" thing and repair or replace it for free. Still waiting on it to actually get to them via UPS."
1,Mislead while the calendar ticked off 6o days on Amazon,"The Seller told my husband that we must have bought a defective unit and could we please just send back for testing. This took us out of Amazon's loop which was one mistake. Then, the delays to get it back to us just in time to clock out the 60 days when we could use Amazon's buyer protection.Apparently, my husband has now read more reviews to find many customers share the problem we had so that is why I titled ""mislead"".We returned the original item within a few weeks so should have had the new one in plenty of time to discover the problem was ongoing. However, multiple excuses and delays conveniently ticked the clock so we are stuck with this item.So, lesson learned, do not go outside of Amazon ever when buying on this site!"
2,Didn't solve the problem,"This seemed like a great solution in theory when neither the cable co. nor my electrician could find an easy way to run cable to the 3rd floor of my house. Though the distance didn't seem further than recommended, the units were not communicating well. When we finally did get it working, it was inconveniently place and a bit temperamental. We ended up returning the system."
4,Very good product,This unit performed very well and we are very happy with it. It would be nice if they made a battery pack for it so it could be used for field video production.
4,Works as advertised,"This device works as advertised and it was very easy to set it up. I was mistaken to think that it would support multiple remote ends, but it's a one-to-one device with a choice of 4 codes. The very bright red power LED is annoying, however."
5,Worked great - On a different channel,"I finally broke down and got cable service. We installed DirectTV a couple of weeks ago. I wanted TV in my wife's sewing room, but it's next to impossible to get a cable to that room. Decided to try this RF-Link product.My transmitter is in the south side of 2nd story house. The reveiver is on north side main level. Signal goes through 2-3 walls and floor. At first, there were statically lines and sound cackle. Rotated and couldn't get it to go away. Turned off other wireless devices and got no improvement. Then I remembered that there were four channels. I moved from channel 1 to 2. Same static. Moved both switches to channel 4 it worked like a charm. Couldn't be better. I like the way the remote control works from the local TV, through the receiver/transmitter, to the ""mouse"" and then to the DirectTV box."
2,unreliable piece of.....,"I bought this a couple years ago, when there was no alternative.I got one transmitter, and 3 receivers.Every week or so, when nothing has changed, I needed to change to another channel to get it to work right.When someone walks in the wrong place, the picture would go wonky, and sound was lost.The transmitter quit after a year or so, and I bought another.This week, that one broke.I've been fighting with this thing for a couple years.So, I just bought the Nyrius, and it works better with the first plug in than this one worked ever.Better picture, better stability.Good bye RF Link, I won't miss you....."
2,Picture disruption,"We were excited to purchase this upgrade from our old 2.4GHz set. However, we were unable to get it to transmit without it ""blinking"" every 5 seconds or so. Very annoying. Couldn't figure out if it was the unit or other wireless gadgets in the house. Had to return it."
5,Good solution to an old house problem,"I wanted to move my television from a corner of the room, where there was a cable connection, to the middle of the room where ther was not one. Did a little research, bought it, and like it alot. It works very well with our Dish TV set up. Picture is not ""HD"" perfect quality but more than acceptable for me. Only drawback is the red power light that stays on but a piece of electical tape took care of that issue."
2,Couldn't get this to work,"I'm not technologically adept, so, even though the Ad promised that this would be easy to set up & use, I was unable to get it up & running."
2,Somewhat worked for year until complete failure.,Setup from bedroom located at back of house to outdoor Tiki bar approx 30 feet away. Upon first installing was able to link up signal from bedroom. Most of issues was with remote. Sometimes it worked. Eventually it would never work. Signal weaken and after 2nd year was total useless even when positioning the devices 20ft apart in same room. Outside use had direct line of site through window.
5,This is a VERY Good Product!,"I have satellite TV in my home and it would be almost impossible to run the satellite dish input to my TV set in the bedroom. For years I used the older RF Link 2.4 Ghz transmitter which worked just fine. After some 10 years of 24/7 operation it gave up the ghost. I found the 5.8 Ghz transmitter receiver combo here for a reasonable price and purchased it. I was quite leery of such a high frequency transmitter as they tend to have not such a good track record for non line-of-sight reception, and I am shooting this signal some 45 feet through 5 walls in the house. Boy, was I surprised! This system looks and sounds great! Keep in mind that this system only works with Standard Definition TV signals, not High Definition, which is fine for my application. Maybe there is a newer model out that does transmit and receive HD, I don't know. I would not hesitate to recommend this transmitter receiver combo to anyone.Dave"
5,RF-Link,"I got the RF-Link to send Cable Video to my backyard garage. My TV in the garage ( about 75 feet away from the house) did not work after the signal went digital. So I got the RF-Link 5.8GHz to send my cable to the TV. It was easy to hook up. The cable box had a 3-component output for the transmitter and the TV had a 3-component input for the receiver. I hooked them up and without much fooling around the TV had all my cable channels (including the HDTV ones) right away. Also, I can run the DVR function and any other cable features. I have only one issue. The audio has an annoying static pop that I hope will go away when I do a better job of aligning the antennas. I have not had good luck with wireless (phones and FM headphones) in the past but am very pleased with the RF-link. I strongly recommend it."
4,Audio Video Transmitter,"Setting up and connecting the transmitter and receiver to the cable and TV was very easy. Aligning the units for optimal reception and getting the remote extender to work properly took some time, but now the system works great. Nice picture and so far I've only noticed interference when someone walks directly between the two units. I'm very satisfied."
2,"Like the product, but customer service not so good so am giving a 2.","I bought the product and it was working great for 1.5 months and still works with the exception of the fact that I can't use my remote from my bedroom now. I have to go into the other room and change the TV. I called the company and I have to send the transmitter, receiver and the IR Mouse back (AT MY COST). They said they could have it up to 2 weeks. They will try to repair it and if not, they will replace. This is all good but I am a bit miffed by the fact that I have to incur the cost of shipping when it is clearly their defect. And, that I have to go without TV in my bedroom (sad I know) because of their defect. I wish they were more accomodating but alas they aren't and I am at their mercy.Will update after the unit is fixed.So, I did send it back at my cost and they fixed and it is still working so I am happy with that."
1,This device breaks after two years of careful use. RF-Link does not honor warranty.,My RF-Link broke after two years of limited use. The company was not interested in repairing the device or replacing it. Don't buy this product. There are numerous reviews like mine that state that the device fails after limited use. Buyer beware... too bad I didn't get warned when I bought it.
3,Ok for the time,I got this a while ago.It was ok for the time.The reception was a bit snowy in another room.Theres probably something better by now.
3,Crappy Remote,Generally a good product EXCEPT for the cheesy remote. Started eating batteries then quit altogether. So far no luck on getting the RF-Link to work with a universal remote.
4,RF-Link AVS-5811 5.8GHz Audio and Video Transmission System,"Works as advertized. I bought it principally to transmit audio across a large meeting room--a couple hundred feet. Works crystal clear. I have subsequently set it up to transmit both video and audio from my cable box to a TV on the second floor. Although the distance is not very great, it is through two walls. All comes through sharp and clear. There is an occasional brief vertical roll--but most of the time the image is very stable. I have had some difficulty using the IR repeater--appears to work intermittantly. I suspect the batteries in the remote are weakened but it works fine in direct use with the cable box so it should also work through the repeater. Sometimes it does--sometimes not."
4,Very good performance,The wireless video transmitter/receiver performs as advertised. It works during microwave operation and cell phone use without any interference. The ability to change the channels of my satellite receiver remotely is extremely helpful. Highly recommended.
4,Met Expectations,"Works well with direct line sight. Not such good reception when going through walls. Overall, satisfied with performance. Would recommend."
1,Poorly made,Purchased this from Amazon. Worked great the first 2 times I used it. Then the receiving unit died for no obvious reason. Waste of money to purchase an item that works for only 2 hours.
3,"Works fine, but I expected a little more","I just bought this to link my computer to the TV in the purpose of seing online movies. Since the computer is in another room, I wanted to go wireless. The image quality is pretty good and stable (not HDTV though). The only trouble was that my video card only has S-video port out, and this unit only has composite video in (RCA). That meant I had to buy an adapter ($80). Too bad this unit wasn't built with an input S-video as well. Pro: setup very easy, no interference with my 2.4 GHz phone."
2,Transmitter and Receiver needs direct view of each other,"This is a good product, but did not work in my house. The transmitter and receiver need to have direct view of each other. I have concrete walls in my house, therefore it did not work very well. But I still got a signal, just with lots of lines/interference."
4,RF-Link AVS-5811 A/V System w/IR Repeater good stuff,"The 5.8GHz of this product makes it ideal when using telephones and/or wireless Internet which run on 2.4GHz frequency. The added feature of the IR repeater is a great addition to this kind of unit. It enables you to change channels, stop;rewind;ff;play;pause, and power up and down your source in the same room as your receiver. This source could be a DVD player, VCR, Cable/satellite box etc. As with ANYTHING wireless, you have occasional interference and static but you do have the ability to choose between one of 4 channels to keep those to a minimum. I'm using the unit in the next room so I can't vouch for the distance of this unit but I am going through one brick wall with no problems. All in all, the pros outweigh the cons."
5,Fantastic !!,"I put them in a distance around 50 feet from each other, and there are 3 walls between them , and the image quality is 100%."
3,cable tv wall coaxial jack,i bought this to avoid making holes on my walls to transmit cable tv to different TV sets. but to my disappointment when i received my AVS-5811 the transmitter has no coaxial input jack. it only comes with A/V RCA jacks. How do you connect this transmitter to cable TV coaxial wall jacks? help Anybody!!!!!!
3,Just fine,"This system works fine as a TV signal extender, but for good quality of the video a line of sight between the tx and the Rx is a MUST. Even for short distances, the signal goes ""snowy"" once a wall is between the transmitter and the receiver.If distance and Line of Sight are not a problem for you, it's recommended.I use it for sending my Directv decoder signal to a new small TV in the kitchen and it worked. Sometimes I just send audio to a couple of speakers and they are OK. The remote control extender is a great idea.Again, for short distances it works. I can't see it working at 300 feet as advertised."
2,Doesn't work!,"TV is in the living room, second TV i bedroom, one room inbetween the two and it doesn't work at all."
1,Did not work for me.,Using the unit across two rooms but could not get a clear signal on any of the 4 channels. Multiple big white bars scrolling from bottom to top of screen and many popping and crackling noise.
3,Other uses,I think the product stinks for as a video sending unit but for extended RF singals it is awesome. I have a TV mounted on a wall and all of the AV equipment behind the wall in a closet. I use this to forward the cable RF signal from the TV room to the closet and it works great compared to the other garbage RF sending units out there.
3,Missing connector,I thought the product had a Coax. I wanted to use on the TV in question. Otherwise the product works fine.
1,do not buy...,i tried it and gave up. The picture quality is very bad. cant go thought 3 walls... I used it for 1 time. don't waste your money
1,Hard to say...,I can't write a fair review of this product. It was incompatible with my (admittedly outdated) system. I had to send it back. It might wirk just fine with a more sophisticated system but it didn't work at all for me.
1,What is included?!,The manufacturer web site says it includes both transmitter and receiver units. http://www.araneusa.com/he-avs5811.html But does it?
1,Great if I only need 2 minutes of TV,"When hooking this product up to my DISH network 311 receiver it only worked for 2 minutes, wonderfully I might add, then would stop. I did this three times and thought I would write to the company for support, due to the instruction manual lacking information. Well I now see that the instruction manual originated from this same company, because I still have yet to hear a response email back from them and its been over two weeks!! In concept this is a great product, but still needs tons of work and support along with it."
2,Quality Drop,I have owned this model for several years and have been satisfied so when it finally quit I immediately purchased the same model again. The IR repeater for the remote did not work on the new one even though the transmitter and receiver were placed in the same position as the old one. RF Signal was very good. I sent it back for a replacement which Amazon did very quickly. The second one was worse than the first. IR repeater still did not work and now the RF signal deteriorates and comes back about five minutes into use so the picture fades to snow along with the sound then pops back on. Will look for alternative product.
4,"Good unit, minor but solvable flaw","If you read some of the reviews you will find that this unit has a problem ""finding the sweet spot"" as one reviewer put it. I have found the solution, it appears that the power supplies shipped with the unit don't have enough current capacity. Specically the transmitter unit needs at least a 1.0 Amp power supply (12V) or high brightness video sucks the supply dry and the video quality suffers.I substituted a 1.0A power supply (wall wart) and the unit went from unusable at 10 feet to perfect video, you can even stand between the transmitter and receiver and you can't block the signal. If you buy this unit, go to Radio Shack and get a 12V 1Amp supply for the transmitter and you'll be very happy with the performance."
2,Didn't work at my house,"For those wondering, the package did include both the transmitter and the receiver. However, the product did not work at my house. I live in a townhome with houses on either side. No way to know what kind of wireless electronics my neighbors are using. There was so much interference that the product would not be usable in my house. It did transmit picture and sound, but with lots of noise and picture disturbance. We even tried the initial setup with both transmitter and receiver in the same room. I can see that the product has a lot of potential, but it isn't quite there yet. If you have no interference where you live, it might work for you."
2,"Okay, but AngelTrax is superior","I tried this and AngelTrax side-by-side, and the AngelTrax (not for sale at Amazon but you can find it on eBay) is a much more versatile system. The RF Link will only broadcast the signal selected on another device, so you can't watch different programs on the primary TV and the wirelessly-connected set. AngelTrax, on the other hand, has its own TV tuner so it will broadcast any cable channel and, at the push of a button, a signal from an AV device (like digital cable or a DVD Player). The remote for the RF Link is barely functional, relying on an infrared ""mouse"" to send a channel change to the primary device, while the AngelTrax very effectively controls channel, power, and volume on its own tuner. Both worked fine (minimal interference) in my home in the presence of a 5.8 ghz phone and a wireless network.The RF Link is really quite inferior to the AngelTrax, and it costs more. Choose the AngelTrax."
4,Great Product,"I was nervous about buying this product aftering reading previous reviews. However, I needed something that would work in my home's wireless computer network and 2.4 GHz cordless phone system. The 5.8 GHz A/V Transmission System was easy to set-up. I connected the cables, turn the system on, and it worked! I was up and running within a few minutes. The unit transmits my remote control's signals with no programming to the transmitter located on another floor of my home. I would have given this product a 5-star rating but if someone walks between two units it causes moment of static.Feel confident when you order this product. It works great!"
2,Static Noise in receiption,"Set sender and receiver in two rooms next to each other, only one of the channels has reception, and the reception comes with strong static noise. The receiver unit does not support S-Video or Coaxial connection. Return the unit. Get refund in one week excluding $7.5 shipping cost."
5,awesome rf transmitter,"This little gizmo does exactly what it claims it will do. The signal goes all over my home, clearly. Totally simple to connect. You can plug the transmitter into any TV and the receiver on any other TV in your house and watch what is on the first TV. End result - you can carry a small TV anywhere, no need for a cable/other jack, watch any TV show, including what you've recorded on the DVR if the RF-link is connected to that TV. Really enjoy having it. Causes zero interference with any other electronics."
5,Great Working Product,"I am very pleased with this device. I tried an X10 video sender before this one, which operated in the busy 2.4GHz band, and it was plagued with problems. This device worked right out of the box, the video signal was crisp, without any static, or other nonlinearities.Since this device works in the 5.8GHz band, there is no interference with the microwave oven, wireless router, cellphones, Bluetooth sets, or most other wireless devices which share the 2.4GHz band.The only thing that put me off from buying the device right from the start was that it was priced higher than the competition ($109 instead of $50). However, you most definitely get what you pay for. The build quality and performance are great!This device has been working for about 2 months without any problems."
4,WORKS GREAT!,"Hooked up in a flash, works perfectly through the floor.If only it had a standby feature..."
4,Great Problem Solver,"I bought this after discovering that Directv could not run a cable to my kitchen. With a brand new TV and no ability to receive programming, I was very frustrated...until I found this! Installing took less than ten minutes--with three children under five trying to ""help""--and the image quality is quite nice. I only wish it could connect via HDMI rather than through AV."
5,Excellent Device,"I ordered this to allow my wife to watch cable channels we receive in the family room on the digital receiveron her kitchen TV. This thing is truly simple to use. It was a virtual plug n play. It worked great the first time, did what she wanted and most importantly my wife is happy!"
2,"Good product, but doesn't last","I purchased two sets of this product. The 1st receiver failed 14 months into service. The unit would stuck on a channel or automatically switch and the power plug won't stay in without taping it to a specific position (the units were left on all day). The second receiver also failed. Power plug kept slipping off and shutting down. With the second set, the transmitter started generating noise.Great product during 1st year of use, but doesn't last long after that.Sorry."
4,well worth it - my second such purchase,"Very good wireless transmission of composite video - almost as good as being hardwired. Don't expect much from the IR remote control relay feature on these - it didn't work AT ALL on the first set I bought, so I returned them. On the replacement set, it was only 'so-so' at best, so I bought a separate remote control extender. But for the basic job of what these devices do, of transmitting good solid video and stereo audio wirelessly within a residence from room to room, they do that quite well."
4,Wonderful alternative when cable isn't an option,We were not able to get cable to a room in our home and someone suggested this product. It was a very easy install and did exactly what we needed. The transmitter is in our bedroom and we put the receiver in a room about 20 feet away. The only trouble we have is that occassionally when the door is shut there is interference with the signal. Other than that we are very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone with a similar problem. We opted for the more expensive system because this 5.8 GHz is not the same frequency that so many other products in our home have so we don't have the interference problem when the phone rings or the microwave is on. It was worth the extra $25. We are so excited to have cable in this room now!
5,RF Link AVS-5811 5.8 GHz Wireless Audio/Video Sender/Receiver,"Pretty impressive wireless audio/video sender. I have the unit in my living room pointing through a stone fireplace and a garage wall. Reception is very good. Occasionally the signal is lost when someone walks through its signal path, but overall, I am very happy with it.It was very easy to setup. I haven't played with the wireless mouse. I just use the remote control for my DISH receiver since it has a UHF antenna."
4,Does what it needs to,"It really does stream tv from one room to another even through walls. Not sure how far it would go, but I've run it as far as about 50 feet and this was non-line of sight, still worked fine.If you walk through the line of site, you might notice some brief interference, but it's not unbearable. The picture is good to very good, just shy of excellent as text tends to shadow. For performance, I give it a 4 to 4.5 as it's not completely perfect, but is significantly better the Radio Shack 2.4ghz one that interferes with everything.I may ned up getting a second one soon as it now allows me to put tvs in rooms that I could not before."
1,Piece of Junk,Cheap unit. Stay away. Didn't even last six months. Only worked if both units were within line of sight of one another.
1,don.t buy it,"i brought such product from amazon by 140$, worked only for 3 days then stop sending and receiveng signals, and remote control not working from the begining, i tried to contact the rf link support, they are not responding to emails, not answering phone calls, it looks that i throw 140 bucks in the air, my advice don,t buy it, bad expensive product, no support, no costumer service, just u r throwing ur money, it will work for few days for these money"
5,RF Link AVS-5811,"Excellent product. Easy to set up and performs well. If you want to use the remote control for the cable box to control your remote TV, it's to plug one end of the range extender into the RF link and place the the other end (IR sensor end) next the the IR sensor on the cable box."
3,Works well on standard TV-Not so good on HD,"I bought this unit to extend my satellite audio/video to the kitchen area. It produced a wavy video picture on the 20"" flat screen HD TV. I swapped the HD TV for similar size not HD flat screen I had and the picture is perfect, no distortion. I'm not sure if the problem is with the specific HD TV I tried it on or not. I did turn off all other electronics in the area to try and eliminate any external interference source but it did not help. The picture on the non HD TV is fine and the range is good."
5,Works great ...No problems,Easy to set up and works great so I can watch Direct TV in my office without paying the $5 a month for another receiver.. Just hooked up to my master bedroom TV and BOOM...Can watch TV in my office !!!!
3,beyond it limits,I tried the unit and had marginal success. My needs were beyond its capablities. At 115' and thru 5 walls it just could not provide a good picture. It was very grainy. The remote repeater worked well though. The 2.4ghz repeaters would not show a picture at all. This kind of suprised me as the lower band should pass thru walls easier than a 5.8ghz should. I guess the distance was to much for the lower band. Looks like it is going to have to be wired considering the long distance and the number of walls for me to have sat in my shop. I returned the unit.
2,Pretty Disappointing,I have used a similar device from Radio Shack for years. But my old relay had its antenna busted which hurt the picture quality. I ordered this as a replacement.Sitting in the exact same spot this RF-Link was worse than my 4 year old broken antenna Radio Shack. The distance was 12 feet with a single sheet rock / 2x4 interior wall between them. All on the same floor.I'm just going to drill a hole in the wall and run coax.
3,Good AV / Bad Remote,"The Audio/Video from this device is perfect. The remote extender, however, is terrible. It works about 25% of the time. There are times when the remote extender will work for about 30 min without a problem, but then without any changes to the transmitter or receiver, the remote extender will just stop working. I know it is not the remote because if I go to the same room the remote works 100% of the time."
2,Audio/video is good but IR remote extender feature is useless,"Sends very good audio/video signal, however, the remote control extender is practically useless if the units are more than about 30' apart. I have the receiver in a room about 50' away from the sender and I can rarely get the remote to send a signal no matter how much tweaking I do with the antennas. I will now need to add a separate remote IR extender ($50) even though this product is supposed to handle that task."
2,Good if its the only 5.8ghz product in the house,I purchased this to watch TV in the kitchen. I hooked it up to my system IN THE NEXT room. This unit only has four optional channels and apparently doesn't like 5.8ghz AT&T phones or 5.8ghz netgear wireless routers!
5,RF-Link well worth the money.,The RF-Link worked right out of the box with no adjustments necessary. It continues to function as advertised with no problems.
4,"Works great, even in the ceiling.","We have a set up where we are using this to have a TV in the master bathroom. The problem has never been the distance, it is only about 30 feet from the TV in the master bedroom , but the problem is that we have the receiver in the ceiling in a crawl space. It is next to a ceiling mounted HVAC unit, so, lots of metal and power and interruption.This unit is our third one that we tried in this environment - and it works perfectly. Perfect picture and sound!"
3,TV out side using RF-Link,The RF-Link for out side TV viewing was what I wanted. This solution provided exactly what I needed. It linked very well via wireless feed from my Satellite feed out to the porch. The picture was great with little interference. I would recommend if looking for an answer for 30-40 yards.
1,Did not work for me,I could not get this product to work through a wood floor with carpet that was between the transmitter and receiver.I returned the unit for full credit which was issued in a timely manner.
1,Won't transmit 15 feet,The RF-Link AVS-5811 doesn't work as advertised. It would not hold a signal 15 feet through one interior wall in my house. The signal continually dropped on all 4 channels. I am returning it. I would rate this product as 0 (zero) stars but this system makes me rate it as 1 star.
2,Returned and trying something else,"Ordered the 5.8GHZ unit to stay away from my wireless lan. However I have 5.8GHZ phones at the house. Received exactly as ordered. Easy to install and setup. However, I am unpleased with the quality of the sound and especially the audio. Tried all 4 channels with minimal change. Clicking sounds in the audio every 2-3 seconds that drove me crazy. It is possible this is due to the phone system. My connection was no walls, 40 feet away direct line of sight. Video was also choppy by walking in front of the signal. I've returned the unit and going to try the SLINGBOX network unit and see how that goes. Does not cost all that much more and can watch it directly on any PC."
3,Video is great but IR Remote is lousy,"I bought this only for the 5.5 GHz spectrum. I had the 2.4 Terk but I had too much video interference in my house. But the Terk IR remote was perfect.The audio and video at 5.8 is perfect. Just a little interference when you walk thru the ""beam"". My application is 50 ft thru 3 walls and a 10"" concrete wall to my outside patio. THE IR REMOTE DOES NOT WORK. Period. I have moved the IR sender all over as suggested in the reviews but nothing works. I even placed the sender inside a box to block out all other light sources.....zip.However, I'll keep the unit since the 5.8 video and audio is so good but I'll buy another IR extender.Bottom line - View this purchase as temporary until another manufacturer (Terk?) has a 5.8 solution. Once they make a 5.8 model I'll toss this unit in the trash."
1,NO Customer Service - HORRIBLE Company,Unit worked OK for a few months then the IR mouse (remote extender) stopped working. They never responded to e-mails. They never answer the telephone. Their support forum is a joke - nothing but pages and pages of spam postings. This is clearly a company that doesn't care about customers.
5,Who Could Ask for More!,"I've been trying to figure out how to get video into our bathroom for 2 years. there was no good way to run a new cable without major construction. A relative told me about wireless so I investigated and found this unit. I have a wireless computer network plus wireless phones so I wanted to make sure things wouldn't interfere. This setup seemed to meet the need. (higher freq than the computer and lower than my phones) It took all of ten minutes to hook everything up and bang, I had TV in the bathroom. The remote works and everything. Exactly as advertised. The picture is great and the sound is just fine. I always read the negative reviews before I order on line and I can't believe anyone has a problem with this gear. All I can figure is they didn't do the homework to assure they won't have a problem with some other device in their home."
2,"Don't be optimistic, the image will be noisy.","I wanted to believe that some of the reviews I read about the RF-Link introducing static wouldn't be true for me. For my test setup I placed the transmitter and receiver less than 3' apart and immediately saw (or failed to see) dropped frames. This system would likely work fine for transmitting the signal from a security camera, but not for entertainment equipment.Thankfully, Amazon has a good return policy."
2,need better quality control,could not get the transmitter to turn on. no red lights..finally after much playing around i found that when the switch is turned on and pressed in with finger i get the red light to come on.. so for me to get the transmitter to work i have to put a piece of tape stretched tightly over the switch to keep it pressed in..it does seem to be working from second floor though concrete to first floor. remote extender works well also. if it wasnt for the defective on-off switch i would rate it higher..
1,Poor Transmission Range/Wall Penetration,"I tested this unit at home over distances longer and through more walls than in the primary application (a church). It worked well at home but when tested at the church I was unable to receive ANY signal, audio or video. I was confident that my home simulation was adequate, so trashed box and packing materials. Big mistake! I suggest that you test these units in ALL aplication locations within the 30 day return period."
3,Disappointed with signal quality,"Despite having a very robust wireless system in my house, picture quality is not what I expected.Pros:Easy to set up.Cons:Picture quality is only fair.Three stars. Not as good as expected."
3,Photo is deceptive,I bought this exact model 2 1/2 years ago and wanted to add a few more. Unlike the old style these have annoying red light in the front that is blinding. these do not come with the external antenna that they show in the picture. This system does not work in combination with the old style. If you don't find this review helpful- I really could care less...but I do wish someone would have wrote this review before I bought it.
1,RF Link AVS-5811,"Purchased this unit to transmit TV signal from the second to a first floor. Signal gets transmitted however the quality is really poor. If somebody walk in the area close to sender or receiver, it results in a lot off noise to the TV signal. Every time I used this unit, I had to adjust antenna a little bit to get a better sound quality. In summary, better then nothing, but don't expect this unit provide you stable and reliably signal."
4,Great unit for the price,"Very happy with this item, works great. The picture and sound are not perfect , but I can live with it"
5,Very Pleased,"Very pleased with what I purchased. I needed it for a upcoming job, and got everything I needed quickly. I would recommend this again. Thanks a lot."
1,Stopped working after just over a month,"I received this item June 19, 2011. The setup was easy and the signal was great on all 4 channels. Yesterday, August 5, it stopped working altogether. The signal broke up pretty badly for a couple of minutes and then it quit. No signal on any channel and no amount of adjustment brought helped in any way.Of course it is about 2 weeks past the return window with amazon. I have requested a refund anyway and we'll see if amazon supports their customers. A $102.00 piece of electronic equipment should not be dead after a month of use.Save your money.Edited to add that amazon quickly agreed to make an exception to their return policy under the circumstances. So although the product I received is clearly defective, kudos to amazon for their professionalism."
2,Works OK But Don't Expect Much Range,"Based on the other reviews I purchased this unit to remotely control my DirecTV Tivo from the basement. With the sender and receiver separated by only eight feet and one floor, the unit works perfectly.The units would not operate, however, when separated by about 30 feet and going through three walls, even after much trial and error aligning of the antenna. Sometimes I could see parts of the picture and hear bits of sound, but the 30 feet was just too far for satisfactory results. I even tried different locations in case nearby electrical wiring might be causing the problem, but always the 30 feet and a couple of walls was just too far.So I can recommend this device only if your sending unit and receiving unit will be no more than 15-20 feet apart."
4,My Second,"This is a replacement for my first RF Link. The first lasted 6+yrs operating flawlessly 24/7. We have cable TV and to get a second cable box would cost me $15/mo. that's $180/yr x 6= $1080!! saved.When my new RF Link arrived it wouldn't send the remote control orders to the RX'r. Got an RA and returned, the replacement arrived about a week later and has been performing well. Currently I'm using it to connect our house and my office which is about 50ft behind the house."
3,Good video transmission poor remote control extender,Received the product on time as is typical from Amazon. We Bought this product to provide satellite transmission from our basement home theater to our daughthers bedroom on the 2nd floor. The product differs somewhat from the illustration as it does not have the front orientable infra-red extender antenna. While video transmission works well the remote control extender is only operational from a couple of feet at best. We had to buy a seperate remote control extender to make it work.
5,perfect!,i just grabbed this book off my college library's shelf....just to keep myself busy 'coz it was getting extremely boring....the book was in ruins....i started reading at four in the afternoon and finished by eight the same day.....didn't move a muscle for more than four hours...after i finished...i was stunned...recommended to everyone who likes a good mystery that can make you sweat!
3,Wish Jane had run the other way!,"This book starts out with a great premise: A woman finds herself walking down the city street wearing a trench coat with pockets full of money,covering a bloody dress and no memory at all. Doesn't that sound promising? It kept me interested enough to finish it, but it's about 200 pages too long. I knew very quickly that the husband was not what he pretended to be, but Fielding chose to beat the clues into the reader long after there was any suspense involved. Something of a disappointment since it was recommended highly by a friend."
4,I loved this book,This was my first time reading a book by Joy Fielding. I thought she did a great job. From the beginning of the book to the end it has a great mystery to it. You really want to know what is wrong with the character and you want to help her. You get drawn into the book right way. I was so eager to read what was going to happen at the end that I never let the book go.
1,THIS MIGHT NOT BE THE ELBOW YOU ARE LOOKING FOR,"This is NOT, I repeat NOT, ELBOW from Manchester, England (""British alternative/indie"")!!"
5,How do I get these guys to come out to Chicago?,"Excellent songwriting. These tunes stick with you and they aren't slow, sappy, tearjerkers. If you like Wilco, Tupelo and that whole alt-country scene, this band adds some needed raw energy."
4,W-50 Wetnotes,Works exactly as it should. I take it with me to the pool to track my lap times and make notes about improvement. No problem using the pencil on the paper. It doesn't erase great which is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 but you can't ask for much better. I recommend it for anyone that needs to write when they know it will be difficult for traditional paper.
4,escape to simpler times,great collection of songs.contains 3 Gene Autry exclusives incl. 'End of my round-up days''Blue Montana skies'&'I'm gonna round up my blues'.
3,So-so,"This book was highly recommended to me, but unfortunately I was not too impressed. Although it is a cute book and a cute idea, it does not keep my daughters interest."
3,Caution,"This book is HUGE and flimsy. I sent mine back. Would be good for a classroom setting, but not for home. I had to give it a few stars though because I love the story so much."
3,didn't really catch his attention,"cute book...great pics...but it didn't catch my 5 month olds attention...maybe later :)...still recommend....son loves Sandra Boynton's ""Going to bed book""....probably cause I've been reading that one to him since he was 1 week old :)."
4,Good night moon,"My 27 months old daughter likes this book, specially because she knows most of the objects that are presented in the book. She likes to point it out the object as I tell her the story. Introduces black and white pictures and the concept of ""nothing""."
4,Classic memories,I believe this is a classic book to read that is great for children of all ages. I have fond memories of this book as my mother would read me this book. I think the child that gets this book is very lucky to have such a great book in their colleection. A book that children of all ages will enjoy.
2,so small,Didn't realize this was a mini-version of the book till I received it. It's about the size of an adult's hand (fingertip to palm). Doesn't make the best gift.
3,no great review,"I have all sorts of books my young one loves. I've never really gotten her into this book. Most books she takes right to, but this one, she hasn't really had as strong of a response to. It's sweet, but not necessarily a necessity to every library."
5,Great book. Would buy again and again.,Between my sister and my self we have 3 girls. Each one has enjoyed this book. Would highly recommend.
5,Kids have loved this story for years....,"Great music and super illustrations. Cute and soothing. Addresses nighttime anxieties and stimulates an interest in dreams. Children get to see their peers explain their feelings. Showsmany cultures and races. Our kids connected with the story, loved the music and the lyrics. They commented: ""We watched it three times in a row."" ""Can I watch it before bed?"" ""I like the music."" ""I like the bunny."" ""I love the monster."" ""I learned about dreams."" Perfect for pre-schoolers - 2 to 5-year-olds."
5,Get the board book and start reading immediately!,"This book has been part of my son's going-to-bed routine for almost a year. In fact, after leaving our copy behind somewhere while on vacation, we had to buy another! Now almost a year and a half, he loves finding the mouse on every page and has learned about saying goodnight to people and toys as a way to settle down before going to bed. And, really, it's just the kind of book that makes you smile when you put it down for the night. ;-)"
5,Wonderfully soothing bedtime quiet book . . .,"At 27 I still love this book! My dad read it to me and my sister and brothers, and now I read it to my little girl. The lines stay with you, the repetition is great. A classic!"
3,"A classic, but not one of the best.","It's a classic, and I would recommend owning it, but it's not a top-ten story. Our daughter shows little interest in this book."
3,"Its okay, but not great....","I'm not a big fan of this book. My two year old seems to like it but I'm grossed out by the illustrations. Luckily, I got this through my Border's rewards and I didn't pay cash for it. The Sleep Book by Dr. Seus is my recommendation."
3,What's all the hype about?,"Everyone was telling us we had to get this book, so I got it and I'm not all that impressed. I thought it was pretty boring and my one year old did too. She won't let me get even half way through it before grabbing for another book. The bunny that came with it was cute! Maybe she'll enjoy it more when she gets older?? As of right now, though, it's not one of our favorites. I know it's a classic, but I really don't see what all of the hype is about."
2,"""Goodnight nobody""?","This book is much lauded, but makes little sense. There's a creepy old lady whispering ""hush"" and an intentionally blank page, and half the pictures are boring, tiny renderings in black and white. Do not recommend."
5,"A ""must have"" soothing ""going to bed"" book for early readers","Summary:An older book (about 50+ years), that is entertaining for young children, with a cute ""rabbit"" main character. It lets children know that when they go to bed at night, they safely go to sleep with their ""friends"" (inanimate objects) around them making ""sleepy-time"" a time of warm and simple magic.Educational Summary:Simple soothing words, good rhythms, a few primary colors, simple story, simple and common objects.Story:A rabbit goes to bed and says goodnight to all the objects he sees in his room (mittens, mouse, clock, etc.), and outside his window (moon).Negatives:First, kids really love this book, so my negative may not really be important. But, the book is not really very colorful, and the story seems a bit slow. But, my kids really liked to have it read to them and never seemed to tire of it. So, what do I know?!"
5,A timeless young children's book,My children loved this book; I can't wait until my nephew (5 months) starts to appreciate it.
5,Wonderful Book,"My son and I read this book for the very first time this past week. At only 7 days old, Gavin found this book fascinating! I was amazed how he stared at the pictures, taking it all in. He loves this book! I sit the bunny next to him and we read the book every night at bedtime - usually 3 times through and he is quiet and attentive the whole time. He's only 2 weeks old now and I can't wait for him to grow older with this book so he can start pointing out the things in the pictures that have him so spellbound. I plan to get this book for all my expecting friends."
4,It's ok.,"This book is ok. There are other books that have a better more interesting story & melody to them such as ""Is Your Mama a Llama"" and ""Polar Bear Polar Bear What Do You Hear?""."
1,Not my cup of tea,"I hate to pick on such a revered classic but IMO this is a really stupid book. ""Goodnight mush, goodnight old lady (really a rabbit) saying hush.""The back flap says it has lulled children to sleep for generations. Can't see why you'd want a book to do that. I gave it a try after receiving two copies as gifts. My daughter who loves books will see me bring it out, put her face in the couch and wail. I think that says it all."
2,May not be suitable for infants,I bought this book for my 6 month old baby based on the mostly good reviews it had. However I found that it is very hard to put the book in front of her and read aloud as she tended to grab the pages of the book. It would be great if the book is a board book. The pages of the book are also big and thin which made it quite difficult to flip the pages. I found the colors very dull but I guess there might be a purpose to it as it is a goodnight book. I have stopped reading this book for my baby and will probably try again when she is older.
3,Repetitive but Interesting,"I know that this is book is a classic and everything but my two year old and I found it a bit repetitive. By the third read, he was already reading it to ME!"
3,Harsh colors for sleepy eyes to focus on.,"The colored pages were harsh and reminded me of Van Gogh's The Night Cafe. Very acidic, sharp and unsoothing. Acid red and acid green are the dominant colors and they tend to vibrate and irritate our eyes when we read this room in a softly lit bedroom. The alternating black and white pages are so bland and boring in contrast.The story is soothing and simple but perhaps a bit too simple for older toddlers. Our toddler lost interest in the book at age 2."
3,Goodnight for good,"This book has a wonderful reputation, but it did not live up to it in my mind. The story line is practically nonexistent as a child tells of the things in his bedroom and then says goodnight to each one in turn. The repetition and rhyming couplets aid in the decoding of words and rhythm of the speech. However, the rhyming and too frequent use of the word ""and"" mimic neither speech patterns nor the conventions of writing. It must be explained to children beforehand that the text is poetic and not prose. The text can be hard to read in places with red lettering over a purple background. The illustrations switch from colorful, rich cartoons to black and white isolated sketches, which is characteristic of the times when it was published (to save money). But, they do give a feeling of discontinuity. This book did nothing special for me and I don't plan on using it in my classroom..."
2,It's just o.k.,"I bought this because it was so highly recommended here and by some other parents, but I am disappointed. We've had it for two years now, my son is now 2 1/2. I've tried to follow the cadence, which is awkwardly combined with the flow of page turning. The illustrations are amateurish and boring. (Who leaves a bowl full of mush to sit in the bedroom overnight?) Sorry, This book just doesn't click for us."
5,Simple ritual takes the fear out of bedtime,"Most children don't just like rituals, they need them. This book incorporates simple ritual into one of the more difficult and scary things every child must master -- falling asleep. Seeing the young bunny saying ""good night"" to everyday objects and then peacefully falling asleep takes some of the fear out of bedtime. I think this is one reason why a lot of children want to read this book every single night.While many adults are put off by the ""ugly"" illustrations and seemingly boring text, there's a good chance this book will become one of your child's favorites."
4,The story stays with you!,"A bedtime ritual w/my first two children, Goodnight Moon is a classic in my home. So much so that I must buy a third copy for my third child as the first two copies have worn out. The story is simple enough to have a calming effect. And when you adjust your tone of voice to the story, getting softer as you read along, it puts the little ones in a sort of transe. Sound crazy? Yeah! The illustrations are just okay, but when u read this book to an infant or toddler @ bedtime, does it really matter?FYI this book is available @ Babies R Us for$ 6.99..."
5,GOOD NIGHT MOON,"I GAVE THIS BOOK 5 STARS BECAUSE IT IS EASY TO READ AND THE BLACK AND WHITE ILLUSTRATIONS AND COLORED PICTURES ARE GREAT. FINDING THE MOUSE ON EVERY PAGE IS GREAT AS WELL. LOVE, LOVE. LOVE THIS BOOKAND YOU WILL TOO!"
3,A classic that doesn't need the add-on,"I love the book, but the plastic nightlight that came with it went in the trash almost immediately after it came out of the box. Just get the board book and don't clutter your house with the plastic."
4,Helpful for children perhaps having difficulty sleeping!,"For young ones to give them a sense of security, that if closing their eyes and going to sleep means giving up control and if that frightens them, having a litany of goodnights to say gives them the opposite feeling - being able to not only pass on an affectionate attitude to other beings, but subconsciously perhaps giving themselves the very same idea, so as to make closing ones eyes and going to sleep feel normal and not perhaps so frightening."
4,OK,"This is a great story, one that you don't mind reading over and over again!The kids love it very much!"
2,Also out on that limb,"I agree with ""Out on a limb"", this book is not at all what I expected it to be. I think it is very weird, and not at all what I want to read over and over again to my daughter every night. I recieved two copies of this for my baby shower, and would've returned them if they hadn't been inscripted in by the giver. They both just sit on the shelf collecting dust, 'cause this mama ist't going to read them to her little girl.Original posted July 2005Updated February 2007OK, I may have been a BIT harsh in my previous review of this book, and I'm sorry if I offended anyone who loves this classic story. My daughter, now 3 1/2 pulled this book off the book shelf, and asked me to read it to her. She wanted me to read it every night for a week. She likes to 'read' it to her teddy bear and her other 'friends'. She likes the darn thing, so for her sake, I'm updating this review."
2,Weak Character Development and Plot,"Goodnight Moon? Ha! What a joke. Margaret Wise doesn't seem too wise to me, writing foolish books about bears in chairs and bowls of mush. What is mush? What is that? It looks utterly disgusting, like something they would feed you at a nursing home.I also don't want my child (who is a beautiful baby boy) saying goodnight to his food. That's just plain weird. Even though I never intend to feed him the ""mush"" the mother forces down her child's throat in this gut-wrenching novel, I don't want kids to make fun of him on the playground when he waves goodbye to his PB&J; as he throws it out.If you want messed up kids, read them this book. It'll mess with their heads. Goodnight bowl of mush? Are you serious? What is mush? Don't even get me started."
1,mothers against establishing a meter which you then violate,What is it about this book? My kids were indifferent and I went nuts trying to keep it sounding like poetry when I read it aloud. Can't be done. Isn't getting little kids to sleep hard enough without trying to force writing into a rhyme and metric scheme? Give me Dr. Seuss any day!
1,Agree with Out on a Limb,"Never mind that I don't care for this book (I agree the bunnies are creepy and there are wierd things going on). My 10 month old son also has no interest in this one at all. If I try and pick it up, he pushes it away and reaches for other books. Very overrated."
1,Say Goodnight to Goodnight Moon!!,"This book, while a classic, has been repackaged far too manytimes! The publisher is killing it! Not to mention the fact that theslippers included in this package have rubber soles, yet are too small for any walking toddler. PLEASE, let this classic rest."
1,Goodnight Moon,I would never again order from this vendor. Merchandice was shipped in a padded envelope and came to me significantly damaged. I complained and a replacement product was sent in exactly the same condition. A similar product (Runaway Bunny) was ordered from another vendor. This was shipped in a box and arrived in pristine conditon. It's not rocket science.
1,Not sure why this is a classic.,"I've heard people rave about this book, but after reading it to my infant, I'm left a little stumped at why it's so popular. The story isn't exceptionally good or well written. The illustrations aren't particularly good. Some parts of the book rhyme, and some don't, which is a bit inconsistent. Some parts don't even make sense (i.e. ""Goodnight nothing."" ?????). The only good thing about this book is that it is a board book and a good size for smaller hands. One other good thing is my infant likes to chew on it. :) This book was included in a baby wash and lotion set that was gifted to us. I would not buy this book for myself, and I would not recommend this book to a friend. However, it's just okay if you can find it for 10 cents at a yard sale or thrift store."
4,Goodnight Moon 60th Anniversary,"This is an outstanding book that has a magical quality of quieting the busy mind and touching the spirit. Great for children, and their parents.I do however, like the cardboard version much better, as the colors are much more vivid, and feels more special as you turn the pages."
5,A must-have book,"This is one of the few books my 14-month old will want to read again and again. It grows with kids. At first they love looking at all the bright colors on every page. Later you will be able to ask them ""where is the kittens?"" or ""where is the red balloon?""get it."
5,Review by worldoflil.com,"A companion to the 'Going to Bed Book' - this is another must have if you have, like me, a child who never wants to go to sleep. I don't think I'm alone there. While the former is great at prepping kids to do the things they need to do before bed, this is great to read to them (or with them as they try to find items throughout the book) as they drift off to sleep. I'm sure if you're reading this you have kids - or are looking for a gift for someone with kids - this is a must have!"
4,Great for Easter,"I bought this set for my daughter (20 months)to put in her Easter basket. I wanted a board book and a bunny and this certainly fits the bill. I think that board books are generally over priced so the inclusion of the stuffed toy softens the sticker shock a bit. The bunny isn't anything too special really, but as anyone with a toddler, or anyone who has ever bought a happy meal know, it needn't be. The book itself, is a faithful reproduction of the original, in a sturdier form. I am sure my daughter will enjoy eating it. I am pleased with this purchase and cannot wait for Easter."
5,Wonderful classic to begin early literacy skills with your child!,This is a great book to begin reading to your child very early. It has very predictable text and is great to begin early literacy skills that children need before they begin school.
2,Size of the book in Picture is a BIG FAT LIE,"I was looking for a large board book (the size of the book in the picture). What came in the mail was a small board book! This picture of the little girl holding the book (under the book for sale) is a trick. It is nowhere near that size and this should be considered to be FALSE advertising! I was extremely disappointed! I must emphasize that the book is great, I was just deceived by the size."
3,"Yes, I'm just wandering around the site looking at books","Awww. =3 What a cute book.It's all nice and stuff, but it would be pretty boring if you read it to your child. Good night mittens, good night kittens, good night blah blah blah. It's simply a rabbit saying goodnight to a bunch of things. Find something more interesting and imaginative for your child."
3,Goodnight Moon,I was a little disappointed that the book was so small. I was hoping that it would be like some of the larger books that I have purchased in the past. It is not an easy book for older children who are physically and mentally challenged to handle. I enjoy reading it to the children but it is alot smaller than I expected. If I knew that it was going to be this small I would have purchased it at a store where I could have seen the size of the book. Thank you K.Riding
2,I Don't Know How it Became a Classic,"My daughter likes this book and my son probably will too, but it reminds me of the book version of Barney; kids love it and parents don't. None of the adults in my family who have read this book like it.The book it a rhythmic poem. First we learn about what is in a little room and then we say good night to those things (Good-night, Mush?). The artwork, like in the author's Runaway Bunny, is better in the black and white drawings than it is in the color panels.The Rhythm can be relaxing if read properly and its completist use of phonic makes it good for children to read themselves, but otherwise I just don't get this book."
1,inacurate description,This is not what I had expected. I expected a hardback book as the description stated plainly. I wont return this item because it will cost additional money to do so.
2,Not sure what the appeal is with this book,"My son doesn't like this book and he usually loves books, I tried reading it to him at around 1 year and waited a few months before introducing it to him again. He doesn't seem to care for the illustrations or story line and I have to admit it's rather boring...."
4,"Close to Immortal, But No Cigar","Although this book has some pretty graphic drawings reminiscent of Paul Rand, in nice primary colors, I found the characters to be rather one-dimensional. Their development is entirely absent, and even a method actor couldn't find their motivation. For example, why don't the cats and kittens devour the rabbits?This book is divided into two sections, which do segue into each other nicely. There is the ""before bed"" first act, and then the denouement, in which the protagonists sharing their cozy middle class abode wish each other ""goodnight.""I found Eugene O'Neill's ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" to be a more thought-provoking and cathartic study on a similar theme. However, ""Goodnight Moon"" is prescient in that it is a harbinger to many of the plots of the 1970s television series, ""The Waltons."""
5,happy customer,"book was as discribed, arrived within time frame, price was good, smooth transaction, thank you"
5,"Simple, Fantastic - A must have for all new parents","I had never heard of this book until my firstborn came along and someone gave it to us. I read this book at least a couple hundred times; well, repeated it because after a few readings you have it well memorized. The book lends itself to your reading it with inflection and even whispering. A terrific gift for all new parents or grandparents."
4,Very good book for babies and toddlers,I read this book to both my kids before bed for months. It is a good way to settle down to nightime. Good pictures illustrate the story too. I highly recommend.
2,Beware - Cloth Book version does not include all pages of original book.,"Goodnight Moon is an amazing book, written simply & creatively, almost how a child himself may have written it. BUT this cloth version excludes a large portion of the text & images of the original. I suggest buying the original hardcover, & not the cloth cover version."
2,disappointed,"Maybe it was supposed to be obvious, but I never would have purchased this if I'd known it was an abridged version of the book. But, it is very cuddly. It makes a wonderful pillow for my son on his activity mat."
3,Too small,"When I ordered this wonderful book I was not aware that it was the small card board edition I purchased. Thus, i was disappointed to see that the wonderful illustrations were scaled down to a format that does not give them justice. Hurds illustrations need far more space to get the most out of them."
5,A must buy,My children enjoyed this book as children. My mother bought it for them. She buys this for all the grandchildren and great granchildren. At 88 she is the one that asked me to get her this book to give to her latest great grandson.
5,Most Awesomest bedtime story,My 2 yr old daughter loves this book. We read it every night. She actually reads it to me now!
5,Goodnight light and the red balloon..... Fabulous bedtime book!,"We love this book- our copy is well-read! When children are read to daily, they learn to love reading. Perfect bedtime stories, to calm everyone down and make us ready for sweet dreams. If you can find the LARGE size board book get it- they're fabulous keepsakes. Perfect gifts for any child, and a perfect tradition in your own home and family!"
4,good for going to sleep,I had never heard of Goodnight Moon until my niece was born but since then it has become a favorite. I read this to my little one as a signal that the end of the day is near and it's time for bed. This book has a lulling quality that is soothing and calming. At times I still can't see the hype but my little one loves this book so that's all that matters.
5,A great read,"Goodnight moon is an excellent bedtime story for preschool age children. In the story, to postpone his own slumber a little bunny says goodnight to everything within his sight, toys in his room, animals outside the stars and the moon. I liked this book very much the slowly darkening pictures are sure to put little ones to sleep, the way the story ends in a whisper only adds to this dulling effect. Overall a very good story."
5,A Charming Classic,"This book is very adorable. I read it all the time to the kids I babysit, and it always puts them fast asleep. I remeber when I was little even I loved the book and had memorized it. The book really is adorable, so if you've got little kids around, DEFINITLEY read them this book."
2,Black and white pages,"The book was recommended as a great children's book. I haven't read the story so I'm not sure about it as a children's book. I can speak to the quality of this book. I bought the paperback because I prefer that over hardcover, but the pages are all in black and white, which is very disappointing for a children's book. I think the best part of children's books are the large colorful images."
4,one of my favs as a kid.....,"great book! I'm sure he'll chew the edges, very ""baby friendly"".... its has nice thick pages and is very colorful!"
5,Goodnight Moon Is A Must Have,"I teach kindergarten and love to read children's stories. My class of four and five year olds are always impatient and can't sit still long enough to listen to most stories. However, they love this book. The story is engaging and the text is simple. It's a wonderful book to read before nap time."
5,It's A Real Good Book!,I am six years old and I love Goodnight Moon - it's my favoritebook! My cousin's birthday is soon and he's turning one - I'm gettinghim this! I think this book is good for anybody who loves MargaretWise Brown's books. The bunny is cute and I have the doll that goes with the book. So enjoy Goodnight Moon if you ever buy this book. Your kids will enjoy it!
5,The best first book you can read to your baby!,"At 11 months old, my son is already pointing to the pictures as I read the story. The one line format is perfect for a first story for babies. They happily anticipate the next line, and can participate by finding the objects as the story is read. It is a ""must have"" book in every children's library, and is a joy at any time of the day, not just at bedtime."
5,Goodnight Moon,Who doesn't love reading Goodnight Moon? I remember my mom reading this book to me when I was little and I'm so excited to carry on the tradition with my son. It has become part of our nightly routine...bath bottle book bed!! He really focuses on the colors and enjoys hearing this story nightly!
5,Goodnight Moon,Love love love this book. My children all enjoyed it - we've worn out 3 copies. Now I love giving it as a gift to new little ones. Excellent book.
1,wrong product / no refund,"This is not a board book, it is a regular copy of Goodnight Moon, and frayed around the edges to boot. We sent it back and were told that they would refund our money, but it has been a few weeks and we haven't heard a word."
1,It'll put you to sleep alright!,"My daughter never liked this book. My husband nor I ever cared for it either. It didn't keep our daughter's attention at all nor did it ""soothe"". It just didn't live up to all the hype. We read to our daughter all the time and have since her birth and she loves almost all books, but not this one. She much prefered Sandra Boynton's board books."
1,Put down the kool-aid...,"Never heard of this book before about 10 years ago. It was never on my bookshelf as a child (I'm 32) or any of my older siblings. Got it as a gift, and simply don't see what the fuss is about. There are more engaging bedtime books (Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book, and Sandra Boynton's Pajama Time! and The Going to Bed Book among them). Or, look around the room and make up your own, e.g. Goodnight walls/floors, windows/doors, smoke detector, etc. There--just saved you the cost of this book.Ultimately, it probably doesn't matter *what* you read/sing to your kids to wind them down, but *how* you read/sing it to them. Slower, repetitive, deep, more drawn out you-are-getting-sleeeeeepy delivery, etc. Not rocket science. This book fits that pattern, but coupled with the bizarre coloring of the illustrations, mismatched repetition, and hard to read in dim light printing, it's just not worthy of the hype, IMO."
1,Not satisfied,"I still haven't received the book ""Goodnight Moon."" I ordered it over a month ago. Can you tell me why it's taking so long?"
1,Boring... even for a bedtime story,I cannot believe most reviewers say it's a classic. It's so boring my 20-month old son refuses to be near the book.
5,Perfect at any age,"There never has been, and never will be, a children's book quite as wonderful as GOODNIGHT MOON. My mom read this to me when I was little, and I've bought it for other young ones since then because it was my favorite as a child. The pictures and words alone are more soothing than a thousand nighttime rockings.This is an American classic, and it's not hard to see why. It's simple, it's lovely and it's downright perfect. Buy it for anyone expecting a child. They'll thank you for it."
2,Board book - details too small,"The pictures in this board book are cropped, which is just sad because the artwork is such an integral part of the story! In addition, it's very difficult to see the details such as the ""young mouse"" on each page.My mom has one of the original printings, so she's very cautious to read it to my little girl and then hide it away on a high shelf. My little girl now goes after the original book, and tries to climb the shelving, so I had to get her a new full-size hardcover edition. She reaches for this book every night before bed, leaves the antique edition alone, and ignores the board book."
3,Great board book for a young child!,The pictures are cropped on each page which means you don't see the whole picture that you see in the non-board book version.
4,"Soothing Text, Homely Art","Review by Sherry North, Author, Because You Are My BabyGoodnight Moon is a classic with good reason. The poetic text has a gentle, soothing rhythm that truly can lull young kids to sleep. The artwork seems a bit dated though. Every other spread is in B&W;, and the color spreads have a very limited palette featuring a lot of orange and green. This simple art may appeal to very young children, even if moms find it lacking."
5,Awesome Bedtime Story,My daughter is 4 and this book is one the books I have to read to her every night..She loves it.
5,a must have!,"my son loves this book. It has everything a great bed-time read should. I also recommend The Big Red Barn and Brown Bear, Brown Bear, what do you see? These are my 10 month old sons favorite, every night before going to bed he points at these on the shelf and I must read them (sometimes even several times). What a wonderful way to introduce reading to a little one."
5,It's magic!,"I wasn't surprised when the kid wanted to hear the book over & over. I wasn't surprised that I ended up memorizing the text. I WAS surprised, that on a particularly fussy car ride, with no book in sight, when I started quoting the thing from desparation, the kid fell asleep. The effect has been repeated, though not quite as dramatic every time.""As effective as codine, but not narcotic""And I liked looking for the mouse."
4,Great first book for children under 1 year old.,"After perchasing several different books for my now 8 month old daughter. I have found the one she loves the most, Good Night Moon. I started reading to her right after birth, but at 5 months I could tell if she was enjoying it or not. It wasn't until I started reading Good Night Moon, that she became very interested and facinated by the pictures. It is the first book she has really become interested in, with the other books she just gets restless and usually knocks the book off my hands, which tells me she is not ready for them, although they are recommended for the same age group. Every night before I put her to bed I read her this lovely book."
3,"It's good, but not the great book I was told to expect","It's cute, it's rythmic and it's fun to read....but I don't get why everyone makes such a big fuss over it. I think ""Where The Wild Things Are"" or ""The Hungry Caterpillar"" are both much better.That being said, it's worth checking out of the library and reading to your child a time or two."
2,I don't get it...,"and neither does my 2-year-old daughter. She enjoyed it for about a month, but once she memorized it, she started telling me ""no thanks"" when I brought it out at bedtime. I received four copies of this book as gifts from friends who raved about it, but it's definitely not a favorite in our house."
5,sweet book,"This has been a favorite of all my kids, which is why I bought one for a baby shower gift. The story is sweet and the board book holds up through multiple children."
5,Goodnight Moon,Our 1 year old daughter loves this book. She is very focussed when we read to her and actually picks up the book to have us read it if she wants to be read to again.
2,Thought it was the small sized book,"Only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because I thought it was the small miniature version of the book, rather than a very large copy."
5,Classic and peaceful!,"This simple book was read to my mom, who in turn read it to me, and now I love to read this to my 2 and 4 year old. The text is very simple, but the detail in illustration is delightful. As I read, I lower my voice on each page. The last line is a whisper, and it has me nodding off!! Such a calming, sleep inducing story. Sweet dreams!"
5,Every Child Facility Should Have This Book............,"I had a pleasure to read this to a preschooler, or two, finding this story intriguing.Young children may handle this book better, because of its short, and the pictures are eye catching!"
5,Once a sceptic,"I too was once a sceptic as to why everyone liked this book. My niece used to love it and I hated reading it to her. Now that I have my own child (3 months old), it is one of the simplest books to read to him before bed. As soon as I utter those first words, he gets a huge smile on his face. We read it every night and have since he was about 6 weeks old. I just love the basic story and rhyme, and I think the basic colors on the pages are appealing to little ones. I got 5 copies at my shower. Highly recommend."
5,Every child needs this book!,"I haven't heard of one child who didn't absolutely love this book. Make this part of your bedtime routine--it does wonders! This book could easily get destroyed by little ones because of the thin pages, so make sure you keep it safe. Kids are captivated by it--boy or girl!"
5,The most favorite toddler book,"This is a magical book that seems to fascinate young children. This was the most favorite book of my first daughter when she was a toddler and now my second daughther is also absolutely in love with it. It is a great book for a short reading before going to bed. It is also a great book for a child to keep next to his/her pillow at night. Both of my children loved looking for and finding the little mouse on the color pages. They also liked reading this book aloud to themselves again and again. Alternating color and black and white illustrations and simple text seem to resonate very well with children of toddler age.""The Moon Book"" is the ""best book ever"" for toddlers."
5,great classic,"I had never seen this book before I bought it about a year ago, my 2 yr old loves it. No matter how many other books we read, Goodnight Moon is always the last. He is even 'reading' it to me now."
1,Too long to hold my toddlers attention,I have tried to read this a dozen times to our toddler and he just has no interest. And to be fair he will bring several books over to me and have me read them to him but this one he won't even go near. I think there is just too much going on in the pictures and too many words for him to focus on.
2,"book is so-so. Kind of boring, only a few pages, very little text.",Not too thrilled about this book. Got it for the excellent reviews. We have almost all of the sandra boynton books that my 2 year old loves. But this one is pretty boring...just a few pages....some in BLACK AND WHITE and little if any text. More like a cheap picture book. Not worth the price IMO.
5,Toddlers and Babies love it,"This is a classic BEDTIME story. Some of the other people's comments were really dumb. Why are you looking for a stimulating, laugh-out-loud book to put your little ones to sleep. Why are you trying to read it to a 9 yr old while he's playing video games. The book doesn't suck, you suck and your purpose for buying it. It is definitely for babies and toddlers. Plus parents we have to remember that any book can be boring depending on how you read it. You aren't suppose to like it, you're grown and don't have the mind of a small child. They'll love it, read it to them in a soft voice that bedtime requires."
2,Goodnight Moon,Was as advertised but did not meet my expectations. Maybe it will grow on me after some family use.
3,Not sure about all the hype,I got this based on the positive reviews...the sheer number of them. It is OK but I don't like the fact that there are some black and white pages and some coloured. The pictures also are small and don't really grab me. My baby is still only 5 mths old so I will see if maybe this is just an adult thing.I prefer for going to bed time 'the going to bed book.'
3,Not for a very young baby,"I wanted my infant son to have all the classics, but this was just too small and ""busy"" for him. This is probably most appropriate for a baby that's at least 9 months old. There are just too many small things to look at - very young babies can't focus on the details.However, it remains an excellent story and I hope to enjoy it with my son when he gets older."
3,Very boring...,"I got this book after hearing so much about it and I must admit---I don't ""get it"". I don't understand the love or the hype over this book. I find it terribly boring, and don't particularly find the illustrations very interesting. Call me crazy...."
5,The best bedtime story ever created!,Goodnight moon has been my favorite book ever since I was a little kid now that I'm older my thoughts have not changed at all about this book. If you want your child to have the best bedtime story ever then buy Goodnight Moon.
5,the best bedtime story ever!,I have read this book over and over to my two children and they both still love it! My 3 year old can almost quote it word for word. My 5 year old is reading books and it all started with Goodnight Moon.
5,Simply the best bed-time book ever,"We don't have fights over bedtime in our house. I credit our routine, of which ""Good Night Moon"" is a big part. This has been the last book my two-year-old daughter and I have read every night for the last 18 months. The end of this book, ""Good night noises everywhere"", means it's time to go to bed and it works every time.The wonderful illustrations allow us plenty of time to point out and name things in the room. And, as the room gets progressively darker, don't be too surprised if your eyelids get heavy along with your child's!Our highest recommendation!"
2,"Good Night Moon, cloth book box","I was disappointed in the number of pages and the limited reading material in the book. Should have ordered a different version without the cloth box, which is really useless."
5,Classic (new to me but classic to the husband),"If you grew up with Goodnight Moon you'll love this, if you didn't you wont understand what all the excitement is about. It's a nice story, my husband loves it, I'm ok with it."
5,Bedtime story,"Building baby's library, this is a must have book! Definitely a bedtime story and a great book to use with beginning readers."
3,Its way too big!,"I don't really think the description of this item is clear enough, yes it says big book, but I thought that meant the regular size hardbook style book, not a HUGE, oversized floppy book. I do not like it and I can't stand that I have to pay Amazon to ship it back. They should have free returns!"
5,Wonderful book!,"I've read this book many, many times while babysitting my young cousins. And now with twin nephews I'm sure I'll read it even more. It's a delightful book that I enjoy reading as much as the children enjoy hearing it. And the text is short enough that even an active child can sit through it. A definite must for any new mom! Makes a wonderful shower gift too."
5,Wonderful,I have read this book to my daughter since she was only a couple weeks old (she's now 17 mos). It is a very easy to read book that we really enjoy to sit together and look at. Leads perfectly into time for bed. It just has a really nice flow to the words.
4,Classic,"My daughter Loves this...most this. I enjoy reading this story to her, we have even made a game of it. we say good night to almost everything in the room, she seems to prefer this sometime to the story...."
5,Hopefully part of EVERY childhood!,"I read this book to all four of my children and now that they are having children of their own, of course I will make sure it is in their libraries! The cadence of the rhyme and simplicity of the illustrations captivates children and provides a perfect transition to bedtime."
5,Favorite bedtime book,"Just like many other children, my boys love reading Goodnight Moon before bedtime. Our first copy was destroyed when my 2,5-year-old didn't enjoy his newborn brother's presence. Tough times... We ordered a second copy, now reading to both 15mo and 3,5yo. It's short enough that my 15yo can keep focused.Even though it lacks emotion, somehow my 3,5-year-old chooses Goodnight Moon over Guess How Much I Love You. He's a very sensitive and emotional boy, so I thought he would prefer a book that talked about emotions. Not sure what the magic is for my little one, but whatever it is, Goodnight Moon's got it."
5,True classic,"I still remember the feeling I had the first time I read this book to my daughter. She was 2 1/2 at the time. Captivated and excited, she wanted to read it over and over again. There is something about this book that keeps kids interested. I didn't see what the big deal was about the book, which is why I waited till she was over 2 before finally buying the book. I should have bought it sooner."
5,Favorite book for my 2 yr old twin grand babies.,"I purchased this book as a gift for my 2 year old twin grand babies. They had been using a checked out library book and the babies loved the book, so I got this book so they would have their own copy. They love this book and want it read to them every night. The book I received was just as described and I received it in a timely maner."
5,Great ending to the day!,We have been reading this to our toddler each night before bedtime. He will actual go and get his book. His favorite thing is to point to the little mouse. We All love this book! It is something that I now give to all parents-to-be. I don't know what we would do at bedtime with out it!
1,Teaches children flawed natural order,"This book, though highly regarded, sets the stage for something awful in childhood development. It teaches children to anthropomorphise (and on top of that show respect to!) all sorts of random aspects of creation. I didn't climb to the top of the food chain to have my child concern himself with pleasantries to objects. The room serves us, not the other way around! It should thank us for building it and giving it a purpose, not expect us to wish it well at night. It's this type of nonsense that will have my child on the dole after dropping out of high school."
1,"Wow, I didn't know it was possible to hate a children's book","We got this book as a gift at my baby shower. Having heard so many great things about this ""classic,"" I was expecting a wonderful children's book. Maybe these high expectations were part of the problem, but I was extremely disappointed. I just don't see what the fuss is about-- just because something has a reputation for being a classic, doesn't mean it's good. The story is not interesting at all, but worse, the illustations are completely unengaging. I do not like that some of the pictures are really tiny, and the fact that every other page is in black and white seems unfitting for a children's book. My daughter is only 6 months old so I don't know her opinion of this book yet, but I can't get myself to read it to her. My mother-in-law can't understand how I don't consider this book to be a wonderful classic, but I think she's just being sentimental since she read it to her kids and can't see beyond this."
1,Goodnight Mush,"I would never dare to say any of this if I were running for office, but .....I was given Goodnight Moon by a well-meaning enthusiast who felt I could be no parent or claim to know children's literature unless I owned the book. Sure, Goodnight Moon is popular; it's had staying power. But the same could be said for pork rinds and ""The Dukes of Hazzard."" Goodnight Moon is a tired catalogue of meaningless objects, to each one of which I used to say ""goodnight"" three or four times a week. My kid has it memorized, but she can also recognize a Home Depot sign, so that's a wash. Moreover, the shrilly colored, crudely drawn, flatly artless illustrations irritate my eyes. My daughter and I have moved on to something else now--actual books."
5,A Heartwrenching Tale,"""Goodnight Moon"" is the classic, heartwrenching tale that combines a suspenseful plot with a heartwrenching portrait of the frailty of human nature. It's right up there with ""Go Dog Go.""I will warn you that this novel, though brilliant, is not for the faint-of-heart. If your toddler can't take a little GORE or SEXUALITY, you should definitely stay away from this one, and stick to the books intended for the kiddies who aren't yet such great listeners--I recommend ""The Complete Kama Sutra."" This one is worth your money; buy it! You've got to experience this for yourself and see why this disgustingly blasphemous account was banned in 46 states."
1,This is the most boring book ever!,"I would definitely pass this book up. The picture on each page is nearly exactly the same as the picture on every other page - and they are all boring. The words are completely uninteresting. One advantage to this book, is that it does put you and your baby to sleep. My one year old and I enjoy many, many books together (her favorite is The Very Quiet Cricket), but this is not one that she enjoys at all."
1,My baby won't look at it and he LOVES books!,"Perhaps he is too young, 1 1/2 years, but my son will not even look at this book. And he probably has 100 others that he loves."
1,Over-rated,"I am soooo disappointed with this book. After reading all the glowing reviews, I expected more. The story is boring. It just points out various things in a room, then proceeds to say ""good night"" to all the objects in the room. The illustrations not impressive, and every 2 pages alternate between black/white and color. I've been reading this to my daughter since she was very young (now 14 months old), but she's never really been that interested in it."
1,We all dislike this book,"Me, my husband and my young son all have no use for this book. The words and pictures do not hold my son's attention. He's clever enough to need more than just repetition to engage him. My husband finds the colors of the illustrations (the half that have color, anyway) to be jarring, and while the colors don't bother me I think the drawings are rather ordinary. Worst of all, I find it creepy that the rabbits own a cat. My family said goodbye to ""Goodnight, Moon"" after a few readings."
1,My 18-month-old daughter hates this!,"I bought this due to all the raving reviews. My daughter loves to be read to. She has a great attention span for a 18-month old. She would sit through 4 to 5 Dr Seuss' books (The Cat in the Hat, Green Eggs and Ham, etc) in one reading session. When I read Goodnight Moon to her the first time, she didn't let me finish, closed the book herself and tossed it. Every time I tried to read this to her, she said ""No!"" I'd say this book is not a keeper. I don't even like it myself! Is there a way to rate something no even a star?"
1,What is this book's appeal?,"I feel a little silly to be about the only one who doesn't get this book's appeal. It shows the same pictures over and over again, and every other page is black and white. No appeal whatsoever to my daughter, now age 18 months, who has had this book since birth. People say it's the 'lulling"" repeatability of the goodnight theme... I say, it's boring. There are so many bright, lively, board books out there today. I do not recommend this one, classic or not."
5,Excellent Classic Book,My son's father also had this book as a child and loved it. My 23 month old takes this book to bed and loves to look at the illustrations as well as point out things in the vast great green room.Excellent Children's Book
5,Jack's Favorite Book,"This is my son's favorite bedtime book. We have read it to him before bed since he was 5 months old. He is now 19 months old and still loves it! We usually read 2-3 books each night, saving ""Goodnight Moon"" for the finale. He sings ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" on the Goodnight Stars page. When we travel, this book is never left behind. A must-have for every baby."
5,Wonderful,"This is the movie that started it all. A young pioneer family heads out of their home in the ""big woods"" not quite knowing what to expect. They settle on the Indian territory, make a home for themselves, and remain close as a family. Despite a few fearful encounters with Indians, wolves, and a fire upon their house, the Ingalls family remains tight in love. They celebrate their first Christmas in the territory, befriend the loving yet gruff Mr. Edwards, and experience many births, both in their hearts and in their horses. If you want to see a good movie on love and persistence, then by all means buy this one."
5,Classic Tv Show,In this Dvd are the pilot episode of Little House of the Praire not a double lenght movie as the package says.The transfer quality is good as well the sound.The only thing is the absence of any subtitles or captions necesary for international customers like me.I want to see also a good show featuring M Landon and Victor French Highway to Heaven released soon on Dvd.Meanwhile I will collect most of the LHOTP Dvds.
4,Profiles of Key Military Leaders Since 1453,"Who's Who in Military History is a useful reference work profiling over 500 key military leaders from 1453 to the 1970s. The date 1453 is used as the starting point as this is when the Age of Firearms began. Some biographical entries are longer than others. Includes 16 color plates, 300 black-and-white illustrations, nine pages of maps, and a glossary of military terms. This book is ideal for students and teachers of both world history and American history."
5,One of the best noir crime novels I have ever read.,The story's narrator Dolly Dillon is so exquisitely creepy. A Hell of a Woman is the type of book that leaves you feeling a bit disturbed when you finish reading. A fabulous journey into the dark side of humanity. I can't wait to read another Jim Thompson novel.
4,so unlucky with love...,"'A Hell of a Woman"" clearly falls right into Jim Thompson's turf: where a somewhat psychotic loser falls in love with Ms Wrong, then getting himself in deep trouble, and finally realizes that once again he hasn't moved forward in life at all (..but rather is worse off than when he started). Like is famous/notorious ""The Killer Inside Me"", Jim Thompson makes clever us of first-person narration including little slivers of where our 'loser' tells us his inner thoughts. Very chilling.Bottom line: good story, well-written, fine characterizations. No complaints."
2,DECENT FOR A PULP NOVEL BUT BELOW THOMPSON,"This is one of the few letdowns I've had reading Jim Thompson. His typical razor sharp plot is more meandering and desparate in this retleeing of Crime And Punishment. If you're looking to get into Jim Thompson check out the Killer Inside Me for a good intro. Also, if you like Jim Thompson you'll probably also like David Goodis his stuff is Ultra-Dark."
3,By the Numbers,"It has all the elements that make a great noir classic, the babe with the femme fatale, the murder, the creepy main character, but it is not much more than your average crime novel and with Jim Thompson you expect more for your money than rehashed ""Postman Always Rings Twice"" materia"
5,Just right,The product is excellent for one person (child or adult) to sit on while playing a keyboard. The best part was that it took less than a minute to assemble!
1,Product received is as shown in the picture.,Cushion has one third thickness of what shown in the picture. It is not easy to adjust height. You need your own tool unscrew the screw. Do not plan to share with yuor family member who needs seat adjustment on the fly.
4,Easy to fit under bench,The bench was good and slides under the piano well out of the way. A little easy for my 2 year old to knock over though.
4,Piano Seat,Piano seat not bad it isn't too heavy good for kids to move around. Is comfortable when playing. Goes great with the Privia Piano.
3,Good,"mmmm. Not the best bench in the world, but it does his work. Compact and easy to put away. No assemble at all."
2,Casio bench,Not what I ordered. The picture provided by the seller is not what I got. Amazon should look at this particular sale site.
1,Just return my money,I have already returned the wrong items you sent me. just return my money please.
1,Does not work With A2 clippers:,"I bought this adapter kit to use withOster 078005-314 Turbo A5 2-Speed Clipper.This kit simply does not work - clippers on their own work great, once I put adapter on - they just do not cut at all.I ended up buying two additional length blades instead of this adapter kit and extra blades work great."
1,This product doesn't work with the GroomMaster,"This product should not be advertized to buy with the Groom Master Clipper by Oster. although it says these comb guides are ""universal"" they aren't! They don't even come close to fitting on the extra wide cutting head of the Groom Master! DO NOT buy them for the GM!"
3,Was the editor on vacation?,"This book has some interesting small houses, and does include floor plans, sections, elevations, and lots of photos (of varying quality). But the book is full of typos that anyone giving the book a last once-over should have caught: ""and and"", using ""compliments"" instead of ""complements"", and in one case (The Methow Cabin) the floor plan of one building was listed for both itself AND another, totally different structure (The Cavehill Residence). If you're looking for ideas, this isn't a bad book, but its size is unwieldy, its photographs in many cases just clearly enlarged from photos provided by the builders or architects, and there are more than a few errors throughout the book. I'd check this one out from the library rather than buying it."
3,There are better places to spend your money,"This book was quite dissapointing. My biggest complaint is the idea of what is a house. A few of the buildings where guest houses or studios, or vacation homes. The title makes me want to see houses that people actually live in, with all of their stuff!Also the breadth of style I find to be unnecesary. From log cabins, post victorian, modern...no matter who is reading the book, they will think that pages were wasted on the style they aren't interested in.Some other books I found much more enjoyable for $25XS : Big Ideas in Small Scale BuildingsSmall Houses : Contemporary Residential Architecture"
1,poorly made book,"I ordered this book as a gift for someone as it was on their wishlist. When it arrived, it came with a strange plastic vinyl cover that was bent and misshapen, the pages looked like they were printed on an office laser printer with a homemade binding, and half of the images were either blurry or scaled up so large you could see the pixels clear as day. Needless to say it was not the nice book I was looking to give, and returned it immediately."
5,Great Residential Architecture series,"There are a million residential architecture/design books out there, but in terms of quality of pictures and examples, James Grayson Trulove is the best. Makes a great coffee table book for any designer. Its mostly valuable as a visual resource (not alot of text). I love Trulove's message of quality over quanity - its better to have a small beautifully designed house than a mcmansion monstrosity."
5,Nice introduction to the famous characters,"I have managed to collect probably too many versions of the Kenneth Grahame's classic book, The Wind in The Willows, as it has been illustrated by so many good artists including Michael Hague, Ernest SHepherd, Arthur Rackham, Seth Lerer, Robert Ingpen, Patrick Benson and others. The book on this page is a abridged short version from smaller children not yet ready to tackle the whole book. The full page illustrations by Inga Moore are exquisite, and the illustrator has also done art for a full version of the book. This book is a good way to get kids interested in the ""big book"" with the hope they will be motivated to tackle it someday."
1,Extremely Unhappy,"I purchased two of ""The Adventures of Mr. Toad: from the Wind In the Willows by Kenneth Graphame for $44.32 each, which were supposed to be new books. I am upset about what were sent to me. The first book was a Walt Disney 6X8.5 size child's book worth not more than $5.00. The second was the correct book but used, and from the Marion Public Library in Ohio."
4,Don't let them tell you who you cannot love...,"I was expecting this to suck considering everything they've done had been a step-down from the album before. But I think it was actually a nice step-up from Exit English (which was a total disappointments after Change Is A Sound). This album actually has fast songs again. And where as til this day, I still can't tell the difference between songs on Exit English, Dead FM has a lot of dynamics to it. The vocals are a little less abrasive. But the album is still energetic. The lyrics are still well-crafted political hymns (much unlike Against Me or Anti-Flag who have very simple cliche lyrics). Cool guitar work. Fast songs, slow songs. Most the tracks are have an upbeat feel. Decent drum sound. Bad bass sound. Thin guitar sound is pretty thin and low in the mix. But in the final process, the album sounds really together. Probably one of the best mixes, considering the vintage equipment used. Its a good album. Go buy it."
4,Still strong,"Dead FM is a solid effort put out by Strike Anywhere. It didn't really know what to expect going into it, but i was pleasantly surprised. I never really expected it to live up to Exit English or Change is a Sound, but it's close behind them. I've always loved Strike Anywhere for their hardcore style vocals, fast beats, and sing along parts. They have strayed away a little from the more hardcore type songs and a couple of songs are pretty catchy. The album has a good amount of songs although they are pretty short. Favorite songs are ""prisoner echoes"", ""how to pray"", ""speak to our empty pockets"", and ""allies"". Overall i'd give Dead FM a 4 compared to a 5 from their previous other two albums."
3,It's alright....,"It's got a couple of good, short and melodic politically charged songs that pack a good punch but it's only a couple. You can tell that these guys are starting to go real poppy.How To Pray, Dead Hours, Gunpowder and Ballad of a Bloody Run all suck. They're horrible songs.The songs that really stick out (for me) are Prisoner Echoes, Instinct, The Promise, Allies, Speak To Our Empty Pockets and House Arrest. The unmentioned songs are all mediocre."
4,The Cadillac of soundtracks,"Sexy, steamy music. Passionately true to the film, and a delightful homage to jazz music. Harlem Blues will put you in the middle of a jazz club on a warm summer night. Should be called Mo BEST Blues. Love it!"
5,Best Movie Soundtrack I Own,"Say Hey and Beneath the Underdog are the truest jazz jams (they sound familiar, maybe the're remakes of some famous older cats), and Mo Better Blues is a simple, but excellent combo fo trumpet and sax. Again Never is a ballad, also moving, and the spoken work by Wesley Snipes and Denzel Washington about love songs is great. Furthermore, Gangstarr's Jazz Thing from this album is excellent, switching up grooves in the middle of the song to excellent effect, and Harlem Blues is just straight beautiful. Why is Cynda Williams not heard more? The only weakness is that its a short album, but that's not really a weakness, you'll want to just keep flipping the tape or keep the cd on repeat. It's strange how a ballad can merge into party jazz, and then get into some hiphop and then finish with a ballad so seamlessly."
5,MY BIRTH INTO THE WORLD OF JAZZ BEGAN WITH THIS MOVIE AND CD,THIS MOVIE AND CD WAS THE FIRST PIECE OF EXPRESSION THAT OPENED ME UP TO THE WORLD OF JAZZ MUSIC. I NOW REFLECT ON 9 YEARS OF JAZZ MUSIC THAT ALL BEGAN WITH 'MO BETTER BLUES' AND I AM TRULY GRATEFUL. THE MOVIE ACCOMPANIED BY ITS MUSIC HAVE TRULY TOUCHED MY LIFE.
5,Longfellow,"Amazing sound with 7 different twists, the best lyrics the you will ever encounter. it will leave you craving more longfellow"
4,Blow your concepts down,"'Blow your house down' by the wonderful Pat Barker, handles working class, northern women in such a non-judgemental, fragile fashion, it is ever so difficult to perhaps judge them from your own point of view. Rather than portray these women, as sad, desperate and dirty, Pat barker has written about strong, determined, inderpendant working mothers, lovers and friends. 'Blow your house down' recognises the dreary, miserable, mangled environment these women are forced to work in as a result of their own situations, which life has left them in.The main story line tells us of a murderer who kills one of the prostitutes. It establishes the fact that no matter how much danger is lurking in and out of these women's lives, they still carry on working the streets, earning their living. Still haunted by their friends murder, they don't reject their own lives- they risk them.A truly good, honest and disturbing read from one of my favourites."
3,Three flower design moon cake mold,"A new mold, looks and smells freshly carved, a lot smaller that what I was expecting. Would work well for cookies, but not for mooncakes."
3,Same stuff already out there . .,Thought this would have some New insight. It is the same stuff taught in middle school.The point being - master it and you will do well. True.I was expecting more. . .Something new.
5,Medieval culture,"This book is a great, very accessible introduction to Medieval culture, seen through the literature of the time. An entirely different world view prevailed in the Middle Ages. The extent to which this world view penetrated every day life is surprising and fascinating. Lewis's book is well-written and well-researched. He does reference so many works that it gets a bit difficult to keep track of everything, but that doesn't detract from the reading-enjoyment of the book. He uses some Greek words in the original alphabet, which I wasn't even sure how to pronounce, let alone, deduce the meanings."
3,Print size too small,"I was disappointed when I received this book because of its print size. I'll be able to read it but it'll be more difficult than most books. I'd have returned it if I'd purchased it locally.I owned the DVD of Jane Eyre with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark, but after watching it several times, I became dissatisfied with Jane's acceptance of the excuses given for the strange goings on in the attic. Yes, she was in love with Rochester, but still, this is a girl who's presented as one who can hold her own and is not easily dominated. So I finally gave the DVD to the library.But I decided that before I write Charlotte Bronte off as not my kind of author, I'd read her book to see if it makes more sense than that depiction of it. (I'll add to this review after I've read it and decided.)"
1,Wish I had read the reviews,Be Warned! There is no Table of Content for this product in spite of the fact that it clearly stated that it has one.
5,I Purchased Kindle Version Nov 2010 - Both Titles are Included,"I love Jane Eyre. I've read it at least four times. I haven't read Wuthering Heights so I decided to purchase this two for one combo ebook for my Kindle. Despite what other reviewers are saying about the paper versions, both titles are included in this Kindle purchase. I was able to jump to the beginning of Wuthering Heights (the second title in the pair) with an active link provided at the beginning of the ebook. There were chapter links offered, but they didn't work. So the TOC will get you to the beginning of each story but not to a specific chapter.If customers only received one Kindle title, or a partial file, they can contact Amazon customer service and ask them to send the updated ebook. I've done this with other Kindle books that had updates or edits made. Sometimes Amazon sends out an email, but not always."
3,dictionary!,"its paperless, its dictionary so well worth the investment. can i do without? probably! it was cheap hence why i bougtht it"
3,Quite useful,"This is a dictionary, so it is not supposed to be interesting. I always checked the ingredients before buying any cosmetics. This is THE book for me. However, it should be updated I think."
2,Not Impressed,I was expecting more information under many ingredients and less opinions from the author. The Milady's version is much better. Overall I was disappointed.
3,seen better,"As a Beauty Therapist I am very interested in what kind of product goes in to those little jars lined up on my bench. I thought that this book had some good information, but not enough. I would have liked to have it broken down a little more so that each subject (or the majority of them) had a section I could see at a glance on adverse reactions and contra indications. Many products shouldn't be used in conjunction with acne treatments etc and knowing as I do how people don't follow advice given out by their 'expert' it would be useful to see it written down - something longer than a paragraph. For basic reading it's good, but it just didn't do it for me. There are better books out there."
3,"Yes, and No.","We were torn on this one. The author really knows her chemistry, and as such we can eagerly refer this book to consumers and cosmetology professional alike.Sadly, the author knows little about trichology (hair) and consumers could be left to believe that it does not matter what hair products they use. This is simply not the case. Fir example, if you use ""Panteen"" and then want to perm or color your hair, because of the deposits Panteen leaves on your hair your perm or color will be less than good. If you use ""Sun-in"" or ""Grecian Formula"" on your hair and then perm it, chances are that your hair will turm to mush. These small but vital observations should have been added.As always, this is only our opinion.Hair News Magazine"
2,"lacking in depth, falling way short of ""complete""","Winter only skims the surface, when the reader desires so much more depth. Assuming one would purchase this book to obtain serious information, Winter fails to provide. I did appreciate the extensive list of potential ingredients and alternative names. I was hoping for a greater explanation of where and how each ingredient is derived. Thus figuring out if something were negative or positive. For example, lanolin comes from sheep- but how? What is the process? Personally, I wanted more background info into the products' source. I will keep searching on my own."
1,Dated,"I think it is dated, the info is old and not enough of it! Keeps referring to the next definition. Spend a lot of time just to find the word since it keeps referring to smth else. Don't waste your money. Miladys is more expensive but MUCH MUCH better."
1,This book won't tell you the purpose of the ingredients!,"Okay, now that we know exactly what the ingredients are, why not ellaborate on their purpose. How can anyone utilize such a book that only defines the ingredient but not what it is used for. If that is your reason for getting this book, don't waste your money like I did."
3,More Hype Than Help,"Haven't noticed any huge improvement; it is a very nice, thick cream which moisturizes well though. Not sure I will purchase again."
3,"Good, but could have been better.",Although I liked the information that was revealed about how the show is put together. I was hoping to see something new about the cast.
3,Prime Time Fitness is just okay,"Overall, Prime Time Fitness is a pretty fair workout. I was a little annoyed with the leader's somewhat gabby, drill-sergeant leadership."
3,loud noise,this is cheap but the chopper makes lots of noise... so if you have any other option than don't buy this as it make ots of noise while chopping your veges.
3,Good chopper but LOUD,"Black & Decker 1-Touch ChopperThis little chopper does work well but it is very LOUD -- sounds like it's chopping up big hunks of wood instead of an onion or bell pepper! It is easy to work BUT do not expect that you can put in large pieces of vegetables and get evenly chopped sections back -- you have to cut up the veggie into fairly small pieces in order to get even chopping from the machine; otherwise, you get some barely chopped pieces and some finely grated pieces! I think that's just part of its small size."
1,Difficult to use,"I bought this to do what it is described for,a small food processor. It is very hard to get the base and lid both on and off the unit. You have to really push down and twist to get it to lock and unlock. It is extremely noisy. Overall it works but not well and its difficulty in assembly make it a poor buy. I would not recomend it...."
2,Needs Iron Man to Disassemble,"I don't care/mind how loud it is. It chops things more or less the way I want. But trying to get that darned lid on & secured exactly right is frustrating. Trying to remove the food cup from the base is downright exasperating, requires much inspection of the slots, and sometimes is so hard to budge that Iron Man is the only one I can imagine could get it free. Maybe mine is defective -- I got it at Walmart & threw the receipt away, so didn't feel I could return it -- especially after using it. But really -- cheap junk. I got what I paid for, I guess."
4,Very useful accessory for your iPod,I found this a very useful accessory for my iPod and the pricing is also very competitive. A must buy for any iPod user.
1,Incorrect condition listing.,"This text was listed as in 'good' condition, as were the other items I purchased from you (about 4 others). However, I have received the order and this text is in 'poor' to 'bad' condition. The actual book is being held together with clear tape and there is an excessive amount of highlighting/marking throughout. I only note this one, because the others books I received listed in 'good' condition were not nearly in this condition, they were as described, with very light/minimal markings. Had I known this, I would have opted to not purchase the item. I don't like to get books with heavy markings, as this makes it more difficult to read/concentrate. More of an effort should have been made to correctly list this text, as now I am stuck with it and don't have time to purchase another one before the start of class. I would not have paid any money for this book if I had seen it before hand."
5,what up buy this S***,this is the tightest cd ever. i love it and everyone who likes rap should buy it and listen to it as loud as possible. what up lil scrappy
4,Kirks review,Get some krunk in yo system by Trillville is the best song on the album. Its so awesome just listen to it. I dont know why they didnt release it. Its seriously really good. The rest of the album is pretty good to. The beats are sweet.
3,Hot Beats.......and thats about it.,Lil Scrappy and Triville come together to give an album that is really a double album. the first half of the album is Triville and the last half is Lil Scrappy. This CD has some hot beats but the rapping is okay and the lyrical content is also lacking substance. But I guess the whole purpose of this cd is to get you crunk and this CD will do that for you. Dont look too deep into this one because you'll just be disappionted. By now you should know that Lil Jon's purpose is to get everyone acting crazy to his music and this will do it for you. I give it 3 stars for the tight beats and its ability to get the club crunk.
5,THE BEST CD OKKK'k,LIL'SCRAPPY FIRST INTRO HAS A TIGHT BEAT. THEN THE SKIT BOOTLEG IS FUNNY COMING IN TO A TIGHT SONG MY FAVORITE NO PROBLEM THE VIDEO TIGHT THEN F.I.L.A [FOREVER I LOVE ATLANTA]THIS A TIGHT SONG ALSO THIS IS ONE OF THA DIRTY SOUTH CRUNK CD IT HAS ALL THE TIGHT BEATS THAT THA CD WAS MADE TO HAVE. HAVE A SHOUT OUT TO TRILVILLE THEY IS TIGHT TO. GET THIS ALBUM IT IS A MUST HAVE OKKK'k G's UP A-TOWN STAY DOWN
3,Too many skits on dis album man,When i bought this album i didn't know it was going to be that much skits but anyway the songs that i liked on dis album was Get Some Crunk In Yo System that song well have yo trunk thumpin when you play it on the stereo and also head bussa no problem neva eva and the bonus track gone with bohagon But I think it would have been way better with less skits and more crunk music .
3,Crunkness In Its Purest Form,"Well well well...if you dont like the single ""Neva Eva"" then you wont like this album plain and simple. If your not into southern rap this is not the album to get to getcha to like it. But for those of us who like southern rap this album will give u everything u want....but thats it! While the Lil Scrappy side does bring more diversity while the Trillville side is CRUNK CRUNK CRUNK 24/7 365. If it weren't for the many skits this album probably would have been good. Its kinda sad to see that each group only has about 6 songs.Production is what you would expect from Lil Jon....guitars, claps, synth, and bass bass bass. Lil Jon once again delivers crunk on all levels in this aspect. Not one beat sounds too much like the other but if u look back at the Kings Of Crunk Album almost every song on this album could be a rip off of a snog from that album but hearing the fresh new voices does give it a new lift.Great Debut but it needs a lil more substance!"
4,Gets it pretty KRUNK,"I am a chronic rap listener and this is a very good crunk album if you like lil jon yeaaa then its pretty good, but just the voice of lil scrappy and the lyrics he spits are very well produced too."
1,Lillian Is Not Too Scrappy,"I am assuming that ""Lil"" is short for ""Lillian."" I'll say that Lillian is not too Scrappy on this CD, and I am quite disappointed. I know good rap when I hear it, and this CD is just plain, how do my boyz in the hood say it, ""whacked!"" Lillian has fallen short on this one. I am a hip-hop thug shawty gangsta G-Dogg pimpin' homie slice freestylin' rappa from the Dirty South, so I know. That's right, I'm right out of Atlanta, Georgia, or as my thug homeboys call it, the ATL. So you can trust my opinion on rap. This CD will not get you crunked up. It's not very good to blast while you're rolling out in your phat ride. Don't purchase it. Get a Clay Aiken CD instead."
1,Yawn.........,"Lil' Scrappy needs to find himself something called a flow. I guess this is a good record if you like to hear someone talking over super-generic, cornball production. Fortunately, I doubt his career or that of his affiliates and peers will last too much longer. I'll give it 2-3 years at most before these pseudo-MCs are never heard from again. Perhaps, one day the kids who gave this album 5 stars will learn about something called hip hop culture. Yes, lets all get crunk in the club. Too bad noone cops Tag Team's albums these days. This is disposable noise that will soon be forgotten forever."
3,3.5 Stars,Because I like No Problems and that song Some Cut but thats about it No Problems My favorite club song of 2004!!!!! Good Production Lil Jon on that one!
3,okay,"this has a few bangers but not much for an 'album'better off downloading the cool songs (No Problem, Some Cut)"
3,"Decent book, but not what I would call an Encyclopedia","I purchased this book with hopes of having some detailed information and color pictures of about most of the major types of peppers out there. That is not in this book.As a book goes, it's a fairly decent book, plenty of interesting information about peppers, recipes, information about different types, South American cultures and so on, but the photos are only black and white, and no detailed photos of peppers or plants are in the book. I think that calling it an encyclopedia was a misnomer."
1,"From a gourmet cook by hobby, and former Educator","I returned this book to Amazon, because there were no color pictures of any of the myriad hot peppers discussed therein. There is no real way to identify a particular type of pepper with only a black and white drawing/photo.As someone who taught school from elementary to university level, I can say that learners, especially me, would greatly benefit by viewing color photos of the various hot peppers discussed in this publication."
1,Chili pepper refrence book,Full of long winded information.Reading it was like asking a man what time it is & he tells you how to make a watch.
2,Chili Pepper Encyclopedia,"If I had realized there were no colored photos in this book, I wouldn't have bought it. It was supposed to be a gift for a gardener who likes growing chilies, but I decided the format wasn't very interesting.Chilies are among the most beautiful fruits you can grow - but no colored illustrations other than the cover? Sorry, in my opinion, this is a poor presentation."
4,Spicy Hot!,"This is a gem from Dave Dewitt the King of ALL Peppers. He knows his stuff about all there is to know about chiles, from mild to the 'insanity' peppers! It goes into great detail about the history of peppers to how to grow them. The book's layout is in an A-Z easy to find guide. The index is very good as well so you can find what you're after. I have made a scrumptious HOT HOT beef curry from this book, just to give you something to make your mouth water. A good addition to your chile book collection or library!"
1,The book was below expectation,I found the book very basic and confusing not in Encyclopaedia category. I found (Chile Pepper Encyclopaedia) book was very basic . The book included many recipes but not as Chile reference. The book structure is confusing not in Encyclopaedia category. Not well organized.
4,Early Jack Vance Classic,"This book, written in the 1950's, shows flashes of the brilliance of the later works of Jack Vance. The use of language (readers new to Vance would be advised to keep a LARGE dictionary by you, or else just let the flow of the language envelope you), the exotic settings, and the realization that the most alien and unknownable creatures that mankind will ever meet, will always be us."
4,Dave H,"Jack Vance's baroque writing style comes-to-the-fore in this astonishing story. The preeminent world building sci/fi adventure writer in generations tantalizes his readers with an imagination of huge scope and originality and brings all of his genius to bare with ""Big Planet."" You will marvel at ""the monoline"" and heroic efforts of Glystra the earthman in this amazing action/adventure story...truly brilliant storytelling by a master in the genre...."
4,A fun read,"This is a sweet, fun, and clean romance novel that is appropriate for all audiences. Rachel and Colin are two singles who are tired of the meddling matchmakers in their lives, and so Rachel comes up with an idea - they should date each other in order to avoid having to date anyone else! It's a great plan, except that Colin is sweet and funny and very attractive and Rachel begins to wish their fake relationship was real. I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 because Rachel, much like the usual Michaels' heroine, isn't really a very likable character. But Colin is, and really, isn't that why we read romance novels?"
3,Read Aloud Bible Stories: Vol. 3,"We got this book for my wife's class room (Pre-K), Catholic school. I assum its working out for her. She has not said anything to me."
3,Book was fine. Seller was not.,"I was actually quite happy with the book. However, I wasn't impress with the seller, Stacy Jones, who sold me the book. The condition of the book was listed as ""New."" However, when the book came, there were crayon and pen marks throughout the book. I emailed her privately on two occasions and my emails were ignored. Buyers, beware of this seller."
5,great book,"My little granddaughter, Margaret, who is 2 loves this book so much I am getting her all the others in the series"
3,"Well, OK...","This book gets the bottom line done. I mean the conversion charts are good, and the information is all pretty much there, but I really had a hard time understanding some of the instructions. And they really should have done a better job editing. The myriad of typo's made it that much more difficult. But, that being said, the directions can get you through most minor repairs.I got mine for 12 bucks at an auto parts store. That's about what it is worth to me."
4,"Excellent photographs, easy to read",I was able to determine the problems on my son's car and able to confidently have someone else do the work. Book has enough photographs and detailed information for most back yard mechanics.
4,Pretty Good.,"I've owned several of the Haynes repair manuals. I am not a mechanic, but I probably do more work on cars than most people. I just recently purchased a '98 Plymouth Neon and bought this book to go with it. I used it to help me replace one of the rear strut assemblies. The process in the book was accurate. I am also planning to do some brake work, and from what I've seen, this looks like it will be pretty good help."
4,"Good, as expected.","As others have stated, the Haynes repair manuals are pretty thorough and an excellent choice for DIY repairs. Having this or a similar manual handy can save you loads of cash at the expense of your own labor. If that is worth it to you, this manual is a good choice. While there exist some typos and confusing steps, overall (at least from the experience of my projects) this has been a great help to keeping my little Neon chugging despite the fact that I am not particularly mechanically inclined when it comes to automobiles."
3,Blurry,"I've looked through this at a Pep Boys store. The printing job is lousy. The paper is low quality, the print is more gray than black, and the photographs were blurry enough to reduce their usefulness. The instruction for the work I'd wanted to do was simply to have a professional mechanic do it. Still, I'm sure it would be of use for some projects, and if I had more spending money I might have bought it."
5,Looks Great,Bought this as a birthday gift and it looks nice. It has a shiny finish which you have to be careful with if you want to avoid fingerprints.
5,Top of the heap,Best translation of this work. Useful explanatory notes and essays. Highest recommendation.
5,Great,"Though i just purchased this book, i feel that i've found the catalyst of my muscle buliding desire. At first i was skepticalb/c the of how skinny this book was( when purchasing i thought it would be a thick book), but after reading every word in this book I became almost an expert on how to adjust my bodybuliding techniques and eating habits. I learned more from this book than any trainer, bodybuilding encylopedia...etc. This guy doesn't waste your time. He gets right down to the nitty gritty and puts it all out there for you to absorb. He answers all your quesitons to the fullest in the book and when you contact him via e-mail. He provides you with everything you need to succeed in your goals of either shedding fat or building muscle. The eating habits is key and he breaks down everything for you in that section all the way and every idea he throws out he backs it up with logical and credabile facts. Can't wait to see my results:-D"
3,Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do,"Regina is a rehabbed addict who moves to the West End in Atlanta, Georgia for a job whose salary will help her pay the the outstanding mortgage on her home. While there she meets suave and sophisticated Blue Hamilton, the neighborhood ""fixer."" The job comes with more than she bargained for and in the course of her work and her daily life, she does some things she never thought she'd do.Lighthearted and easy-to-read. Read this one before you read Babylon Sisters and Baby Brother's Blues. The character, Blue Hamilton, is such a dreamboat."
5,Great read!,Pearl Cleage is an excellent story teller.. Her stories interwine characters from her other published works; allowing you to envision the the story lines.
4,Right up my alley!,"The first chapter is a real attention grabber and on the whole the plot is good, smudged a bit when the author takes the reader down a path of past lives and supernatural issues and the ocean blue eyes of Blue Hamilton. Too bad becasue her story about living in a safe, secure neighbourhood where a woman doesn't have to ""notice a man coming up behind her and it's okay"" (pg 282) is right on.The author excelled in the many nuances throughout the story. On page 23 I found this African proverb very interesting. ""The hunter is always the good guy until the story is told by the lion."" Then on page 193 the author criticizes a pop culture ""in which manhood is defined by cars and clothes and random sex and money made by any means necessary"" rather than being tied to family and community by ""ribbons of love and protection and responsibility and caring."" Excellently put and I agree with her wholeheartedly."
4,A wonderful read,"I am a huge fan of Pearl Cleage's books. I really loved this latest tale;however, I had a problem with the way Regina's drug habit is presented. Quite frankly, I find it unbelievable that she could have a nasty enough cocaine addiction that she would loose her house and most of her belongings, yet be so ""recovered"" that she could dring cognac, champagne, and get a ""buzz"" on. Since when is this appropriate behavior for a recovering addict? Also, there is nothing in the story about Regina's journey to stay off of drugs and her rehab. She doesn't go to any Narcotics Anonymous meetings, doesn't check in with any counselors, etc. Sorry, but this all seems a bit unbelievable. Other than that, this is a terrific book and I can't wait for the next!"
3,Unbelieveable,A very enjoyable easy read. A magical story about love that will make you laugh and make you sad.
3,Atlanta native,"The best part of the book are all the references in it to Atlanta places and the West End. It was fun to read about all the places in and around the West End, if you grew up in the ATL. The book overall was a bit disappointing. Not what I thought it would be as I read through chapter after chapter. The ending was okay, but left you feeling a bit ""flat"" and did not end as I expected. This was not what I expected for a Peal C book."
5,intellectual treat,"The handling of social issues was much more diverse than the movie ""There Will Be Blood."" The oil man is not nearly as bad in the book, but the industry is a pathetic mess."
4,I enjoyed this book. But....,"I really did enjoy this book. But, I really enjoy more true to life historical books, and I think this book if done as historic rather then fiction based on history would have done just as good. Having grown up in the cities of Long Beach and Signal Hill, some of the locations used in this book with altered names, to me it would have been more interesting. And I am sure the real life adventures of oil exploration and drilling would have made this book still the page turner that it was. I have not seen the movie, and may not, this book holds it's own."
1,Boring!,"Take about two chapters out of the book and make a movie that is 10 times better than the book was. I hate to start a book and not finish it, and I stuck with this one. But one of the worst books I have ever read. Characters were so silly and the whole book was a propaganda piece for socialism."
5,Enjoyable Story from 80 Years Ago,"This is a great fictional story based on the real life of Edward Doheny, who was from my home town of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Doheny was a larger than life character and is well known in California.I somehow missed reading any of Upton Sinclair's work over the years and now I know what I have missed. This is a fast moving story that tells of the early years, and greed, of the oil industry. Sinclair's descriptions are so real that I can smell the orange groves and the oil from a gusher and his characters are portrayed as real people. This is a very informative and enjoyable read. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the history of the oil industry in California."
4,A rotten business,"When Warren G. Harding died suddenly in California in 1923, he was one of the most beloved President's ever. It wasn't long, however, before that opinion changed, so that today he is considered among the worst. The revelation after his death of the Teapot Dome scandal that occurred during his administration was paramount in destroying his reputation. And it involved oil (the naval oil reserves in Wyoming were being sold off by corrupt politicians close to Harding). Sinclair based this novel on Teapot Dome. It basically shows how a decent man and his son Bunny Ross are up against insurmountable odds in the oil business, what with corruption all around. Sinclair's solution was dramatic: for him socialism was the answer; capitalism was too corrupt. A big, brawling novel, not particularly memorable for its style; but its muscular approach and willingness to tackle important issues make it worth reading."
2,"Great Story, but a long listen","I purchased the audiobook version of 'Oil', because I remembered enjoying reading 'The Jungle' in High School.This was a good story, and even though it is set in Southern California in the 1920's the story largely transcends time. However, and this is a big however it was VERY detailed, so much so that it detracted from the story and was too long to listen to it (20+ hours). Go with the abridged version if it is available."
3,Somewhat puzzling,"Yes, I am one of those that read the book after seeing the movie. And overall,I didn't think it was that bad. In particular, the first quarter (on which the movieis based) is a well-told story with memorable characters and events. The problemwith the remainder of the book is that it becomes progressively more like arecruiting pamphlet for the Socialist Party. Sinclair makes many good points,but does so in a heavy-handed manner. As the book progresses, the worldbecomes increasingly more black and white. The second half is an unequivocalindictment of capitalism, and near glorification of the Russian Revolution. Weall know how that turned out..."
2,Disappointingly ponderous.,"This book starts off with some promise, but quickly becomes ponderous in the repetitive details of drilling for oil and capitalist/socialist/communist political drama surrounding same. There are many more productive ways to spend one's precious reading time."
4,Sweeping story with social overtones,"Great book! I enjoyed it! I really did! Seriously, reviewers noted that Sinclair tends to overuse exclamation points (it seemed silly after a while) and hammer his points home. That said, the book is a wonderful story about a basically decent self-made oil producer who lets his ambition impair his honor, and his son, who loves his father but doubts his ethics and is drawn to socialism. It is a wonderful picture of the times in which the story occurs. In fact, I think some of the annoyances of Sinclair's style were credible when the book was written."
5,labor vs. capital,"I am enjoying this book. It's main character is the son of a rich self starter oil man. But how the oil man has become rich is the point of the book. He has become rich by taking advantage of the poor. The son befriends one of the carpenters who works for his father and learns what it is like to not have enough money. Then comes an inner struggle for the young man to figure out if he will take over the oil business and continue in the mode of his father, enjoying the wealth, or take care of labor and possibly not be able to sustain the business."
4,"A engaging story explore class, American History and human condition","I bought this book after watching P.T. Anderson's ""There will be blood""The movie is totally different from the book as expected. ""There will be blood"" is a story focusing on the main character. Yet the book takes us into the oil history through the fictional setup between a millionaire oil man and his son. We are carried through the story in H.W. perspectiveLet the cover said, it's story about greed in very large scale. I found the structure is beautifully intervened with the modern American history.A recommended read if you have the patience to appreciate what the writer tried to present."
3,Oil,"This book was missing chapters and had duplicate chapters.When I notified Amazon they sent a replacement immediately.Sadly, the replacement had the same problem."
1,only received half of what I ordered!,"I'm hoping there is another box coming, all i received is the back window deflectors, the picture on the item shows the front window deflectors!!!! The back ones are great, they slid right into place with a good secure fit, nice solid plastic, sturdy pieces, but....i REALLY need the front deflectors. I have a 93 BMW 318, we bought this car to use for about a year and a half while we're stationed in Belgium. It rains alot here and i like to have the windows open a little. If and when i receive the front deflectors i will change this review to a more positive one."
1,Absolute rubbish,"I picked up this book hoping for some insight and was thoroughly disappointed.The author displays a profound ignorance of modern cosmology and his""arguments"" are completely vacuous.Many of the ""unsolved problems"" in science such as ""how could galaxies haveformed"" have already been adequately answered without any help from the Vedasor any other religious text.I have considerable reverence for Hindu philosophy, but erecting a caricature of modern science and claiming that the Vedas address ""unsolved problems"" only exposesthis ancient and rich philosophy to ridicule while insulting science at the same time."
1,Still waiting,"I ordered a subscription to San Diego Home-Garden back in December, it's now February 16 and I haven't seen a magazine. I finally called the magazine direct to see if they ever received my request, they did show me as a subscriber, but they didn't have my complete address. I haven't received anything yet, but hopefully soon."
4,A Good Book,"This is a good book on orientalist art. The Orient was a very prominent subject used by many European artists, especially French, British, and Italian, in the late 19th/early 20th Centuries, responding to the fascination of intellectual Europeans with the exotic Orient, to which the elite used to travel. The book gives valuable information on this movement, with a large selection of reproductions, many of them in color, the quality of which is fairly good.Usually, orientalist art books, especially hardcover, are rather expensive. My copy is a paperback and is reasonably priced. If you are a fan of orientalist art, or if you would like to know and learn about it, this is a good book to buy."
5,Lifesaver!,"This video is great! My husband is deployed which doesn't always giace me alot of time, pop in this video and I actually get to take a shower! My son loves Dora!! He watches it over and over and sings along."
3,This book could have used a good editor,"I was looking forward to receiving this book, and I usually devour ""human origins"" books, but Berger's contribution to the genre is a bit dry and plodding. I think a good editor could have cleaned up the language and made it flow better. (I think it says something about the editing that the last line on page 40 is repeated as the first line on page 41.) The science appears to be correct, it's just the style that makes the book harder to read than it should be. This is surprising given that it is a National Geographic book, and National Geographic usually insists on clean and clear writing."
4,"Compelling, entertaining, informative","Dr. Berger has authored an excellent book for anyone interested in paleoanthropology. I enjoyed all the scientific discourse, all of which should be readily understandable for laymen, as well as the inside stories into the politics of paleoanthropology (although some of the stories are a bit shocking). Particularly I think we are indebted to Dr. Berger in bringing to life the hominid fossils of South Africa. The book clearly illustrates the continuing importance of A. Africanus, and gives probably long overdue credit to many of it's discoverers. Finally it gives a good general update on some of the most recent fossil discoveries and possible consequences. Highly recommended reading. I hope that Dr. Berger will keep us updated on the progress of the work also in the future."
1,Comments on Gettysburg,I hated this book. Got half through it before I couldn't stand it any longer. Give me TRUE history any time.Mary Timaeus
1,Harry Turtledove he's not,"I'm a big fan of Harry Turtledove and enjoyed reading alternate history from a few other authors as well. I must say that I was disappointed in the realism of the battles and strategy. Changing alternate history to make Southern Generals extra smart and making Northern Generals is NOT a concept for alternate history. It's more like a parody without humor. This could have been a good book and what ruined it for me was a plot that was just too far fetched. If you're a civil war buff and enjoy alternate history, I suggest reading ""The Guns of the South"" by Harry Turtledove. That book is miles ahead of this one."
1,Untrue Tale,"This book might be fine just for reading by someone with no clue to history. To use Gettysburg for a title is such a misleading and for anyone(Dennis Showalter) to use Killer Angels as a comparison is such a misleading statement. There is NO Alternative History and NO ""Quite Differently"" as to what happened at Gettysburg.A book of pure fantasy."
4,enjoyable what if,"As a southerner who grew up on stories about the lost cause, I always heard two recurring phrases; 1.) What would have happened at Gettysburg if Stonewall Jackson had not been killed in a previous campaign and 2.) Would the Confederacy have won the war if Lee had won at Gettysburg? In this book, Gingrich and Forstchen set up a scenario of how Lee could have carried the battle in Pennsylvania, and set up two other volumes that carry the war to its conclusion.I found the book to be engrossing and well written. I can picture the authors standing over a topographical map of the area, saying ""What if...."" They seem to have a solid understanding of the weapons and tactics of the day and a grasp of the impact that politics and political interference had on both the Union and Confederate armies. The latter issues particularly affect the scenario.An enjoyable, engrossing read, giving a plausable what if to the eternal questions. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Highly recommend"
5,Wow! Compelling! Exciting!,"I'm a bit of a Gettysburg fanatic and have even lectured about the battle to my Rotary club. This book really holds true to the facts and creates very logical and believable alterations. What makes it even more fun is the writing itself which makes it enjoyable even if I wasn't particularly interested in the Civil War. In discussing the battle with other enthusiasts, we have often gone over ""what if"" scenarios and have played them out with table-top and computer simulations. This story takes a strategic theory and brings it to life with the historical characters."
2,too technical,"I found this to be too full of military jargon, with not enough maps to make sense of the battles."
3,Cluttered,The coming ad going of so many characters made it difficult to maintain what army some were attached to and who was moving trrops to where. A roster in the beginning of the book would have been helpful.
5,Excellent Read!,"One of the best Civil War counterfactuals I've read in SOME time, and that's saying something!One of the improvements (one of the MANY) over the same authors' ""1945"" is that they resisted the temptation to mix fictional and factual characters in an historical setting--something which is NOT a good idea.I also liked the fact that they avoided Sci-Fi touches (like the time travelling Afrikaaners of Turtledove's ""Guns of the South"")This is a book well worth your time and money!"
3,General Buford,"I have been to Gettysburg and read about it many times. I enjoyed the book right up until the time it stated that Brigadier General Buford died at Gettysburg. He died in December, 1863 and was given the brevet rank of Major General by President Lincoln days before he died. I know the book is fiction, but I closed it and gave it away after that. The tour guides verified that fact."
5,very well written historical fiction,"The War of Northern Aggression comes to light in this historical fiction. The authors showcase their knowledge of true history including details of the brave men who fought and died in this bloodiest of times. As they say, history is written by the winners, meaning all we learn in school has a Northern slant. It was refreshing to see light shed on some Southern heroes. The book puts you in contact with one of the world's greatest heroes...Robert E. Lee. He was a great Christian, a great leader and a true southern gentleman."
4,Back at Gettysburg I think,I felt that I was placed in a time machine and stood next to all these great men. I felt that Newt Gingrich & William Forstchen really got into the heads of the people at Gettsburg. I asked myself why not show the great battles of Little Round Top and Pickett's charge correctly. Two important parts of the battle of Gettysburg. Another factor is the way things were changed to make it look like the South won the battle. It was a great time in American history and the high water mark in the eastern front & the end of the glory of the South. After Gettysburg Lee's army never saw the great times & was on the road to defeat.
4,Brings the Civil War to Life,"Don't let your opinion of Newt Gingrich affect your decision to read this book. No matter what you think of his politics, Gingrich knows history. This book is written from the points of view of a common soldier, an artillery commander, and General Lee. It brings the hell of war to life and highlites the tragedy of the brother against brother aspect of civil war. It is hard to imagine the internal conflict of Lee who trained many of the leading officers in his career at West Point. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the Civil War. It is an entertaining and educational read."
5,"Not the biggest Newt fan, but I loved this book!","The authors of Gettysburg did a spectacular job of setting up a ""what if"" that would have changed this country is so many ways. The battle of Gettysburg was, in all people's opinions, the most influential battle, and the turnig point of the Civil War. Up until Gettysburg, the Confederate army, led by Lee, was winning the war and outsmarting the North. In reality, the North won at Gettysburg and obviously won the war. This book plays things out a little bit differently, with Longstreet influencing Lee to act differently and the South ending up triumphant.I love the spin here and would recommend this book to any Civil War fan or buff. I was tentative going in but was quickly consumed!"
4,a good what if,"When writing a ""what if"" it is necessary by implication to alter the scenario while keeping the story within historical realism. In this book the authors have done a very good job but in certain respects have gone a little too far. For example they have altered Lee's personality from the tired, uninspired fatalism of Gettysburg to a dynamism that closely resembles Jackson. Perhaps this is necessary as it is no coincidence that with Jackson the Army Of Northern Virginia never lost a battle and without him never won one. That said this is an exciting and well written alternative history and well worth a read."
3,Entertaining Fiction,"When I first purchased the book, I was very interested in reading such a scenerio that demonstrated an outcome if Lee had fought Gettysburg differently. I must credit the authors for there attention to detail, yet the whole battle is based on the North doing everything wrong and the South executing flawlessly. I was hoping for a more honest and balanced story. I also found it interesting that all the heros of Gettysburg from the North are either killed or wounded, yet the Southern generals go untouched in such a heated battle.I recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining read, but not as a serious ""what if""."
2,Where was the editor?,"Apparently the authors believe that if General Lee had been of a single minded purpose heading into the Battle of Gettysburg, the outcome might have been different. And they tell us what that single minded purpose should have been--over and over and over and over.Then there is the 5 page sequence where three different characters almost ""gag"" from something they see or smell. SOMEBODY MUST HAVE BEEN NAUSEOUS WHEN THEY WERE WRITNG THAT CHAPTER.I have read many books about the Civil War. They were all more worthy of my time than this one, with the possible exception of The Longest Night."
1,For some R.E. Lee could do no wrong,"Unfortunately, for the Southern proponents Lee could not also lose, and that he did at Gettysburg.For over 140 years, the Confederate loss at Gettysburg was someone else's fault. I wonder if the proclivity to pass on Lee misses the main point.Americans are great at accepting history in a segmented form.Historians did not ponder why Lee came to Pennsylvania?"
2,Not an Historical Novel,"This book was written very well, but it offended. The south did not win the war, and rightly so. If you want to read about the battle of Gettysburg, read Killer Angels -- it is the real story, which cannot be improved upon. What will be next, Newt writing a book about Hitler winning WWII? This book is an insult to the thousands of men who gave their lives to keep our county in one piece."
5,You can't put it down,"Saw the book at our library. First I figured junk, right, cause Newt-baby ... well just forget about that. From page 1 till the end you can't put it down --- vivid, lively American writing. Neither smarmy nor crude, the book is shot through-and-through with the big picture. Yeah, it's about Gettysburg - sort of - but even guessing the books flow and affections, don't think you know what that big picture is till the end. I wonder ... in completing books 2 & 3 ... Gingrich and Forstchen, do they have the same guts as the Union & Rebel men they follow?"
2,"What if, not","I am a big fan of alternate history. This process, if done well, makes one think out the actual history then what could have been if... The success of this process rests on the fact that the writer takes an event and reshapes it via a turn of events that did not, but could have happened. When a writer makes characters change their personalities, this loses its credibility. Gingrich and Forstchen made such a change in Robert E. Lee's personality. There was never a chance that REL would have listened to Longstreet's idea of flanking. REL never could conceive of losing a battle with the north, at this point. He could, however, conceive losing the war, due to attrition but not this battle. The tactical changes post-Jackson were never the same for the Army of Northern Va., as they were prior to Chancellorsville. With 100 pages to go, I put this book down. I just could not get past the issue of Lee's personality.The Killer Angels book by Sharra puts Gettysburg to shame."
4,So Good You Might Think It's Nonfiction,"Living in Gettysburg, I like to get books about Gettysburg. The problem is this book isn't about Gettysburg. It starts out familiar enough, but then after the first day of what was the Battle of Gettysburg, the change happens. That change is what creates the alternative history of how the battle might have turned out. Gettysburg is well researched and thought out and truly reads as a book that easily could have happened. The final battle is gut wrenching as it was meant to be. The only problem I have with the book is one that I have with any good alternate history. It's written so well that I might confuse real details with fake ones when I try and recall my Civil War history."
3,Good stuff!,"Eric S. Brown proves to be one of the strongest young voices in horror in his first solo collection - Dying Days. The title novella takes on a familiar theme, with a surprising twist. The writing lags a bit here and there, and it could've been improved with more action and less telling. Maybe spice up the dialogue, too. After the satisfying novella come several tasty tales of terror, each one unique in its own frightening and clever way. It seems that this book could have been improved quite a bit by an extra proofread and some futher editing. But, a satisfying read and a good book."
2,Dissapointing,"This book was not what I had expected. To start with, it is only 80 pages, and 30 pages are taken up discussing the research history from which our knowledge of Aztec and Mayan myths derive. The 50 pages of mythology offer only a broad overview of myths (broader even than the excellent World Mythology: An Anthology of Great Myths and Epics by Donna Rosenberg). That said, it does an okay job of tying the myths into the culture and has lots of apposite pictures.Overall, however, I regret having purchases this book."
2,Misleading,"From the material on Amazon.com, I thought this book was going to be something at least partially comprehensive. What I recieved was a tiny little pamphlet of a book that washed over the mythologies of two huge civilizations in strokes so broad they told me almost nothing that I couldn't find in a good mythological Encyclopedia. Do a Google search for the Encyclopedia Mythica instead of buying this book, you'll be glad you did. This book is primarily notable for it's pretty pictures."
1,Doesn't feel llike hanes,These T's are a bit on the small side and the cotton is not as soft and doesn't have the thread count I am used to in Hanes.Usually I like these T's but they seem small and less comfortable than my past experience with these shirts.
2,disappointed,"this t-shirt arrived squished/rolled into a ball put in a dry cleaners plastic and then boxed in a tiny carton. I had 2 steam iron it twice, then wash it upon which the pink faded then tried again to iron the wrinkles..it looked like a rag which I am now using it as such"
4,Great t-shirt,"I'm the kind of guy who doesn't like a lot of bells and whistles in his clothing. I bought these t-shirts because they are solid color and aren't paper thin like those expensive t-shirts you find at places like banana republic.They are a nice heavy weight material. I will say that they do shrink so you might want to order one size large than normal. I am usually a medium in everything and I found the medium size to be perfect when new but shrank a bit after a few washes. I'm 5' 9"" and 160 lbs and I found the tightness around my waist to be uncomfortable so I'm going to order the large size in the future."
1,not worth it.,Xl was more like a large. It was rolled up and shoved in a wrapper. The xxl that I bought separate was the right size and folded nicely.
4,A good substitute for Russell Athletics,"I bought these shirts when I could not find the colors I wanted from the Russell Pro Cotton line.They are nearly identical to Russell, but seem to be a bit coarser in texture and cut a little tighter than the Russell.I think washing them a few times will speed up the softening. Otherwise, a decent product. I will probably be ordering more, soon."
2,Quality control has slipped,"I have three very old Hanes black tees, two of which are now so worn they have to be consigned to the rag bin. Hate to do it; I love those shirts. But after maybe eight years of wear I guess it's time. So I ordered 4 replacements and they arrived today. Hanes should be pretty red-faced about continuing to call these Beefy-T shirts. Nothing beefy about them, they are pretty lightweight. Certainly not as heavy as the old shirts. But worse, and why I'm sending them back, is the uneven stitching in the shoulder. One badly stitched shoulder on each of two shirts. The material doesn't lie flat but appears to ""bubble"" up near the collar. Looks bad. Sorry, Hanes, you had it but you lost it. I guess a $7 tee shirt is too much to hope for anymore."
2,beware the sizing,"I'm an average build size medium; not overweight nor athletic build. I used to buy a Hanes pocket t-shirt which fit just great; a generous cut which allowed freedom of arm motion and a slight drape off the shoulder which didn't cling to the body, allowing some air space between the shirt and my skin. This size is not the same as the medium of these beefy t-shirts. These newer Hanes products are very form fitting and more of an athletic cut; tight around the shoulders and chest and draping close to the skin. The chest width as measured at the armpit is 20"" whereas the older version was 21-21.5"", resulting in a big difference in fit. The old size is in between the new medium and large. The newer medium is too tight and the large is, well, too roomy for a good look. The color palette is super but the fit is not the same as it used to be for size medium; the older size doesn't exist anymore so be aware of that when you order."
2,Buyer beware...,"I ordered this shirt and it showed up rolled up into a ball and stuffed into a clear plastic bag. No original Hanes packaging at all. After opening there was a bunch of loose threads hanging off. Definitely makes me suspect of the whole thing. There is a Hanes logo screen printed in it, but since there's no packaging, who knows if it really is Hanes or not. I also found the neck hole larger than other tshirts I own. Disappointed, but since it was only $10 I'll just keep it for painting or something."
4,a real t shirt,why cant i find one like this in a store? this is the prototype tee for the price. just the right thickness and the color is dead-on solid. need more like this one for sure!
2,Perfect! If You're Interviewing for a Sales Position,Offers great interview scenario clips and tips for sales position candidates. I was interviewing for something completely different. Really should've had this information on the packaging and product description. Both mock interviews were for 2 different types of sales positions. I was pretty disappointed. Otherwise it provides no-brainer tips that any interviewee should know anyway.
4,Best Preparation you can Buy,"I have always felt you can never be too prepared but this really provides the complete package. It really covered what I wasn't thinking of in my preparation. You only get one chance to make your impression and with the help of ""Interview Pro"" I nailed it in my interview process. Can't reccomend it enough! -SJC"
5,Excellent B Side,"Yes, the remixes on this are spectacular, but if you're a real Thompson Twins enthusiast and do not have Monkey Man, this will make your day!"
4,Boldly Original,You might not agree with all of Rashid's ideas about what to do and how to live. However I found most of what he said to be inspiring and spot-on. Particularly the organizing hints and the suggestion to be yourself. Only I'm proud to flaunt my bookcase. I checked this book out of the library and will also buy it because the pros outweigh the cons. He gives you something to think about. The book is worth reading even if only for your amusement.
3,"interesting, but a few comments","I just finished this book and like its overall theme and concept. However, Rashid ignores a huge part of many adults' lives: having and raising children. They are briefly mentioned in a relationships section, and later at the end with a life timeline, but the reality of the day-to-day work of raising children is completely missing.Rashid also seems to presume that people have enough discretionary income to upgrade their electronics regularly (he suggests readers purchase new computers, new music-listening devices, new appliances, etc., as soon as they become more efficient). He also disdains books, suggesting that people not display them openly because it reduces clutter to simply read things online. If this is the case, why would anyone actually buy one of Rashid's books?"
2,disappointing,"I was hoping to find more inspiration in this book. It seems a bit random and self-absorbed. I just get the impression that because he's very successful as a designer that he thinks he's tapped into some sort of universal truths about style, which just isn't true. It started out alright, with some positive, energetic outlooks on life and making it your own, but then he also tells you to copy his style. Shouldn't we be finding what makes us feel most positive? Perhaps bright candy colors aren't for everyone? or wearing all white? Also he seems totally unconcerned with what happens to all this stuff after you're done with it.. he encourages you to upgrade things all the time, but what happens to it then? We can't all afford to and even if we could, how much waste do we really need to create? it's irresponsible."
5,Very Good book,"I typed in Karim's name looking for some of his decor on Amazon, and to my surprise there was the listing for this book. I went to my local bookstore, and read 70 pages of it. I had it in my hand, took it to the counter, and then changed my mind, because it was $25! The design and layout of the book is great, and full of what the author constantly notes as ""BRIGHT COLORS"".The next day I immediately started to declutter, some of my things, and even my husbands! This is surely a reference book for design and self help.I have been looking for a book like this for a long time! I am a freelance graphic and interior designer, and I appreciate Rashid's words. I just received the book in the mail today, and cannot wait to read the rest of it when I get home. I'm so excited."
4,Designer Self Help,"Great little pick-me-up book. Bright, easy, fun.Nice to catch this glimpse into a world renowned designer's headand find such practical, pleasant, salt-of-the-earth thinking going on."
1,Agree with Other Reviewer,Alot of what is in this book is inaccurate and false. The writer needs to take a course in how to do research and needs to learn how to verify facts. The book also lacks in details and concise directions on how to follow the trails. Very poorly written.
3,Mini size,"I think this book is great but I was intentionally ordering a full-size hardback, not a mini edition. Nowhere was the book described as mini but that's what was shipped. I feel like it will get lost on the bookshelf amongst the full-size books."
3,Smaller than expected.,"Although I love this story and its illustrations, I did not realize this edition was so small. It's nice for little ones to hold but harder for them to see the detail in the pictures."
5,Great all around!,"I was so excited to see this book offered for sale on Amazon. As a child growing up, my mom would read this book to me - one of my favorites. I've added this to my library to read to my grandchildren."
5,Pelle's New Suit,"A classic I remember reading when I was young. Can you tell which grandmother is Pelle's father's mother, and which grandmother is Pelle's mother's mother?"
2,Don't believe the hype,"I'm not sure why so many people are obsessed by this and other Beskow books. It's a sweet story that recalls a place and time most people today don't know. The values are good, but the translation needs some serious work and the other errata drive me nuts with each reading. I find myself altering some phrases to make it more relevant and understandable. I find it frustrating that so few people are willing to acknowledge the problems with Beskow books."
3,Not much to it....,"This is the ""modern"" paper doll, using magnets instead of paper. The dolls are actually printed metal boxes with Sleeping Beauty and her Prince on each side. I like the idea of a reusable item, but instead of just focusing on outfits, shoes, and such there are lot of tiny, easily lost accessories. I'm constantly finding these small pieces and I don't know how many I haven't found."
3,"Lets say good, it's good","This installment of Masters of Horror was pretty good but not great. I have to say the story was pretty interesting and slightly creepy at times. I would say it is definately worth checking out, but not worth buying."
4,Please enter a title for your review,"*contains spoilers*the first 20 minutes are very slow, after that it picks up and becomes an engaging drama. at first i thought the twist at the end, which is actually a reveal of something that happened at the start, was dumb, but five minutes later what it actually meant hit me (that he wants to keep his wife alive so her ghost can't come after him) and now i think it's genius. i generally dislike twist endings because they contradict the previous story but this one does the exact opposite."
1,Children of Men,"When I saw the trailer for 'Children of Men,' I remembered this movie. The plot similarities are obvious. What was a ridiculous sci- fi B movie plot twenty years ago is now hailed as visionary."
3,2019 after the fall of new york (an average good movie),I find it to be a good movie. although I find it to be similiar to escape from new york. with a differant twist.
2,waiting to see,"Well, it's red, not a very realistic mahogany...a color I can almost work with.The music shelf doesn't appear to work (can't tilt the shelf to an angle that will keep the music where you want it). But my husband, for which this is a gift, may be able to fix that with a washer.But if he can't, we're sending it back. You're getting what you pay for, essentially, but it has to at least function.Followup: My husband did fix it. We really like the wide music stand and lip that holds everything from pencils to harmonicas. It's much more attractive than the old metal stands we used to have in our music room. Hey, for 30 bucks, it's great!"
3,Deservedly mixed reviews,"I purchased this stand directly from Musician's Friend two years ago when it was on sale for $30. It is, indeed, as red as the other reviewers have noted, but I do not think many people will find it ""garishly"" red. The stand assembled easily, but it is not nearly as functional as the metal Manhasset stands and their clones. My chief problem with it is that the stand will not support a book (e.g., a Dover edition of Bach cantatas, or other such heavier scores from which I conduct. I have not yet found the right ""fix"" for this, but I'm sure it exists. If you are an instrumentalist who is not likely to have more than a 20-page part on this stand, it really does look nice in the music room. But if you're a choir director/conductor looking for a stand, I suggest you search Amazon under ""lectern"" to find a sturdier support."
3,Wooden Music Stand,The stand is very pretty. The top where you put the actual music is tippy and doesn't stay in position well.
3,Music Stand,"Music stand arrived in good shape. It went together easily. However, it is a little too tall for my daughter and without taking a hacksaw to the metal post, I can't make it shorter. So a good stand for someone 5'7"" or taller."
4,Patricia,It wasn't for me it was a gift and he really likes it. He needed a nice music stand to leave up in the living room. It looks much better than the old one. My delivery was right on time as promised. Thank you.
1,Terrible,"The online picture of this stand is a misrepresentation. We thought it was a medium brown wood stain, but were shocked to see that it is red, a very bright (not natural looking) red. We didn't try to put it together because it is truly hideous, but it looked like poor construction. When we contacted the seller, he said we would have to pay the return shipping costs, even though it looks nothing like it does in the picture. Terrible product, terrible customer service. Don't buy."
5,Perfect,This book is perfect for describing the process of sheep to shawl to small children. Be sure I will be reading it to my art students when we study weaving and I bring my spinning wheel to class to show them how to make yarn.
4,A must read for all serious humorists,"If you could judge a book by it's cover, you would assume that this book went out of print around about 1964. This is really too bad, because when you try to resell it on Amazon or eBay it will really reduce the price you can ask for it.Robert Benchley, who died in 1945, wielded an extremely dangerous sense of humor that tragically took the lives of many of his contemporaries. Nevertheless, there is no disputing that his work has influenced so many American humorists that it's not even funny.From Woody Allen, Dave Barry, Steve Martin, Regis Philbin and many others to an unknown reviewer like me who is trying desperately to be funny, there is really no comparison."
4,I'm happy with it...,The avgerage Amazon.com rating was higher when I purchased this drive (so was the price). It turns out it works just fine with my Windows XP PC. I purchased Roxio Easy Media Creator 7.0 also which picks up the drive with no problems. The drive is also compatable with Mac OS 10.2.7 or newer using the CharisMac Discribe software.
5,bad business,"I tried this drive on Mac OSX, you would think get up & go as easy as mac is but ohno, the box says its for mac, the CD in the box is for windows & guess what ? this drive does not work on Mac osx or tiger. You turn it on & nothing, nothing mounts to the desktop & I mean nothing so what does one do in times like these ? Goes to show ya!!! buy from apple & you get what you pay for .. top quality. Buy from those trying to meet the mac system & its the worste buck spent for the day. Man I tell ya! windows is so lame. Mac rules but then you guys/gals knew that .. right ? Of course you did.."
1,*NOT* Mac Compatible,"In spite of a product description that says the contrary, this product is NOT MAC COMPATIBLE. It will *NOT* burn DVD's under OS-X. This straight from the mouth of Iomega tech support."
4,Desperately Beautiful,"Saddened lyrics make up this (as the majority of) Morrissey song as Moz adds a soft sense of request to an already demanding tune. As the title of the CD suggests, Morrissey is seeking the help of a Ouija Board to reach a long lost love. Haunting and beautiful at the same time, you can't help but tap your foot and sing along as even Morrissey's varying levels of speech become intoxicatingly rhythmic and familiar. If you do not have the time to buy Moz's Hulmerist video, I highly recommend you buy this CD to reminice over in the car or at home. Equally sad and yet more misty is the second song on the single ""Yes, I Am Blind"". Though not as memorable, fast or catchy as ""Ouija Board"", it is much more likable than the third track ""East West"", which in my opinion is not some of Morrissey's best work."
3,"Must for blind collectors, but not otherwise","In this single, there are the great ""Ouija Board, Ouija Board"" and ""Yes, I Am Blind"" - which are one of the best tracks of ""Bona Drag"". It doesn't testify, though, about the last track ""East West"" which is really not astounding, merely average. If you have ""Bona Drag"" LP, you will not probably listen to this track alone, so why bother buy it?!"
5,A complete overview of resiliency theory for educators,"This book is the best explanation of ""resiliency"" that I've ever encountered. It's easy to read, without a lot of jargon, and it provides all the information one would need on the topic. The author has done a great job pulling together all the research. Anyone who works in teaching, education, social work, child development, or counseling should have this on their book shelf. In short, this book is a treasure!"
3,A combination of the UK singles in 1,"TBH unless you collect japanese singles, it is probably cheaper to get the 2 UK singles, however they both come in those god awful cardboard slipcases with the plastic tray that never stay ooking nice.Check out my other 2 reviews on the UK versions for song reviews but overall the Todd Terry remixes are pretty awful, however the 2 vocal remixes are very good."
4,Hooked on a new series,"Yes, I had never read anything from the Wilde series but Cameron and Mia's story has me hooked. I love a good romance with a spalsh of intrigue to keep me going. An unliklely couple because of one is conservative (somewhat- or so he thinks) and a woman who loves being who she is. Sometimes, it takes only the ""right"" person to bring out be best in someone. So, it is for Cameron and Mia. He's a PI and she's a frustrated secretary with a wonderful artist within. They find out opposites can do wonders for each other. Some of the love scenes burn up the pages but..I loved them. I hope you will love the Wilde side as much as Cameron does."
4,"Really cut book, very hot and easy to read",Cute book with standard romantic plot and chemistry between the hero and heroine. It is a cute book and I like this author in pretty much everything she has put together. The book isn't THAT original so that is the only thing that kept me from giving it five stars but the sexual tension and chemistry is there and the love scenes are very hot so if that is what you are looking for then this will be a good choice for you.
3,meh,"Eh. Too Wilde to Tame is not horrible, but it's not great, either. Kinda meh.The heroine is your standard acts-&-dresses-like-a-slut-but-is-just-misunderstood. The hero is a P.I. and partners with her cousin. Somebody's stalking her and calling her a slut, tramp, etc, and her roomie is in an abusive relationship.I figured out the stalker immediately, but still didn't buy the motive, and didn't like the consequences.But the main reason for the ""meh"" is the writing. It's kind of bland--telling instead of showing. At one point, she tells us that the position they're having sex in is erotic. Good grief. If it's really erotic, you don't have to tell us that.Anyway, like I said--not a bad story, but there are too many better writers to waste my time on more books by this one."
2,Too many story lines thrown in,"I like other works by this author much better. I did not care so much for this one, but it was an okay read. The main male character, Cameron St. Claire, is a private detective. This novel was trying to cover three different cases, instead of just focusing on the case regarding the stalker of the lead female, Mia Wilde. I think the only reason she spent time going into detail for Cameron's investigating a potential cheating woman, was so she could work in Ashley St. Clair (from another book). It just made the book go off in so many directions, that I read through this one slowly. I didn't feel compelled like I couldn't put it down, which is how I decide how well an author can intrigue and capture the reader! This one fell short."
5,You will love this book,The wild books are great. I would recommend that if you like romance novels this is the book to read . Any one would be addictive.
1,Worst of the Wilde Series,"We've been introduced to Mia and Cameron in previous novels but all the anticipation fell flat in TOO WILDE TO TAME. The plot was thin, uninteresting and just filled pages between sex scenes. The sex scenes didn't do it for me either and I blame that on the fact that there was a severe lack of character development. Cameron was a sexy, shell of a man while Mia appeared to be exactly what she didn't want to be labeled ~ a tramp.All of the Wilde stories are the same. The characters agree to a short affair and the result is always the same. I wish Denison would give us something new. I'm barely interested in Joel's story, which is next. If you haven't read the other books in the Wilde series, I'd recommend WILDE THING and THE WILDE SIDE. Their plots are thin as well, but at least the romance is steamy."
2,Too Wilde to Tame,"Mia Wilde and Cameron finally act on a long submerged attraction after he sees her in a wet T-shirt contest. Shortly thereafter, Mia is forced to turn to Cam to save her from a stalker, and as they work together, they fall in love.** The plot is as thin as the shirt Mia wears to win the contest. If you want nothing more than a steamy read, then you might enjoy this, however, it's little more than that. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
4,Just like her Wilde brothers and cousins!,I'm sure being the ONLY girl in a family of boys can be overwhelming when you have all of them behind your back all the time! But this Wilde girl is rebellious and bold just like her Wilde brothers and cousins which I love.
3,"Very predictable,","What to do when you already bought a book and, after reading a few pages, you know who the bad guy is?You could either, keep reading, hoping ""the big reveal"" ends up to be interesting, or you could just quit and find something else to read.It has some funny parts and is not bad, but just predictable."
5,Too Wilde To Tame,"This book was very good. If you like steamy, this is it! I thought the writer captured the emotions of the male character very well. I very much enjoyed that he was not one dimensional. Keep 'em coming Janelle Denison."
4,Remanufactored but the price was right.,Purchased this Tv for a bedroom to hang on the wall. Since the price of these TV's will go down in the near future I didn't want to invest a lot of money in one but wanted a good picture also. I am pleased with what I received. None of the preset color set's looked very good so I had to adjust the color standards to my own preffence and now the picture looks OK. This isn't the top of the line Tv so I am pleased and feel I got my money's worth.
3,Pegboard,"I bought this item for my wife who's a therapist. Comes with 2 manuals, a bag of nails, pins and the boards. It was sent in a nice huge box but mind you, its way bigger than an A4 size paper and thick (~half an inch or more) - looks like a white chopping board. Just be wary of its weight if you plan to carry it in your luggage. No real negative comments on this product."
4,Incredible!,"Petter is a gifted and insightful photographer. Luba is not only a portafolio of his photography but a personal view of his gorgeous wife and sister.This book offers a tremendous range of his abilities with the camera and the quality of beauty he strives for. If Luba is a small representation of this artist's craft, I can't wait for a new publication.Petter has inspired me to pursue a similar carrer and profession. The book was a bit pricy, but the imagery was well worth it.Well done Petter. I hope to meet you sometime and learn from you!!Ed in Utah-"
3,Nice but un-exceptional,"These are very nice, straightforward photos, many of them nude. There's not a high development of narrative, nor abstraction, and I guess I am looking for more of one or the other. The eroticism is very warm and friendly, as well. Must be because Luba is the photographer's wife, but for an erotic photograph to succeed, I think it needs a touch of danger, as Newton did so well. So you are left with very cuddly photos of a pretty girl who is married to the photograher, who has worked for Playboy et al. As if you were having coffee with them and they showed you their latest album. Would you buy it? Not necessarily."
2,Mediocre,"La trama de esta pelicula fue muy poco convincente para mi gusto. Se trata de un chico que queda traumado despues de que su madre se va de la casa y su amiguita/novia tambien se va de viaje sin despedirse. No se, a mi me parece que la relacion entre el trauma y los acontecimientos que provocan el trauma, estan muy fuera de proporcion.Lo mas divertido de esta pelicula fue el personaje de Alfredo Casero."
3,uninteresting,"I have never cared so little about any movie character as for this movie. The characters were poorly developed thus limiting our understanding of their actions. Their story is sweet yes, but uninteresting. Two childhood friends, both with their own problems, try to help each other, somewhat unbelievably fall in love and try to move forward. Joaquin has depression, yet this is so poorly illustrated that he kindles barely any empathy from the viewer. Mara, well, she just needs to grow up. Honestly, it is not that good. i gave it three stars because it was entertaining for a while but it left no lasting effect."
4,Only por sensitve people!,"Pretty Argentine film with the usually cool Adrian Suar playing a lonely man, isolated, full of complexes... until beautiful Leticia Bredice comes back...Good for latin cinema lovers, Argentine movie fans, sensitive Spaniards. I really enjoyed it!"
4,Doc Says,This was awe inspiring. The wording was superb and the flow was impeccable. It spoke what my heart believes.Dr. Laura B. Christopher
5,Priceless work...,"I have not yet had to opportunity to read this work in print. However, I heard it as I watched Oprah's ""Legends Ball"" special on ABC last night. I was moved to tears. I can honestly say the this poem is one of the most beautiful that I have ever heard in my life. I have told all my female friends and relatives about it, and they all plan to purchase copies of their own. If I could give the poem more than 5 stars I would."
3,fine but not spectacular,"Haiku by various authors: Buson, Issa, Chora, Basho and others. A decent collection, three to a page, in English translation only (personally I prefer to have the Japanese originals printed alongside the translations). Nicely illustrated throughout with monochrome brush paintings.Who is it that is awake,The lamp still burning?Cold rain at midnight.- Ryota"
3,Requires a better layout,"This book contains a very good introduction and a _few_ wrestling techniques with lots of good pictures, but some of them apply only to very specific situations. If the author had included more general San Shou techniques, it would become a reference book. The bad part is the layout of the book: the pictures were placed one after the other, with no indication on where a series starts or finishes - some series starts at the middle of a page and ends at the middle of the next - requiring a lot of flipping and attention of the reader."
4,For Wrestlers and Grappling Artists,"Anyone with a background in Judo, jujitsu or wrestling will recognize many of these techniques and appreciate studying the variations presented. I agree with other reviewers that some techniques are not practical against a larger, stronger or skilled opponent. One disadvantage with grappling arts is that a technique can literally tie you up with one person. Nevertheless, there are several moves demonstrated in this book that can be applied and/or modified to off-balance and ""direct"" one opponent quickly into others."
5,Best Resource on Chinese Fast Wrestling!,"I've been practicing this art for months according to the photos and explanations and it's worked! I love the moves that involve hooking the legs and holding the legs. I've practiced with friends and it works pretty well. There is a groundfighting section in the last chapter of the book, but I would research that elsewhere. It's basic and is more of a preparation stage. But this is one element of Kung Fu I'm glad I found, particularly because Shoalin forms were not enough for me. Now I have one of the neglected elements of Kung Fu I need for serious fighting! To all Shoalin Fighters: GET THIS BOOK!"
5,Anne Frank Lives Here,"The first time I saw ""Anne Frank Remembered"" was actually in a Sacramento cinema called the Red Lion. The audience was so moved by this movie that they sat in silence the entire time, leaving quietly as the ending credits rolled. I have not seen an audience react to a film in this manner before or since, not even to ""Schindler's List"". To say the least, Jon Blair's rendering of Anne's life is authentic, respectful and honest. A fitting tribute to Anne and the victims of the Holocaust."
4,ANOTHER INCREDIBLE HOLOCAUST STORY,"IN A TIME OF TYRANNY AND CERTAIN DEATH, ANNE FRANK STILL LIVES IN THE HEARTS OF MILLIONS,THIS MOVIE BRINGS ANNE FRANKS CHARACTER TO LIFE WITH INTERVIEWS WITH PEOPLE WHO KNEW THIS NOW FAMOUS YOUNG GIRL.LET US NEVER FORGET THIS SAD TIME IN WORLD HISTORY, ANNE FRANK LIVES ON."
5,Anne Frank Remembered,"As an actor in The Diary of Anne Frank, I found this video a must in order to better understand the story. The documentary was engaging, informative and moving. Very well done."
3,an adequate but distracted tribute,"at very nearly two hours in length, it is far too long and goes off on too many tangents covering things weve seen before, but when it concentrates on its eponymous subject, it works very well."
1,not a good version,"dont buy it, they converted from PDF to text file, and did not correct mistakes made by machines. You will never understand this story if you read this version."
4,use professional to install,"I have a low ceiling and a newly renovated kitchen above the garage. Pros: quiet, fast. Cons: temperamental. I had it professionally installed along with a Wayne-Dalton 9600 door. The system works well. I had problems initially, but had the installer come back and fine tuned the installation. It has worked fine ever since. Having watched him install the unit, I can honestly say it is best done by a professional, who is familiar with the product. Everything has to be just right--height, balance, clearance, etc. If anything is wrong you will have a problem. For example, the problem I had was that the wire brushed against the trim and got tangled. Easy fix, but an easy mistake for an amateur."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,"We purchaed this opener with our new garage door in 2006. Eighteen months later the motor burnt out and the entire unit was replaced. Twenty four months or so later the motor has burnt out again. The local Wayne Dalton garage door rep has been great to deal with but you should note the warranty only covers materials and DOES NOT cover labor. I am not sure why we had problems with this product. We have a two car garage door (16' x 7') and this openener does not seem capable of handling this operation. We also had problems with the remote and keypads becoming ""un-synced"" and had to constantly reprogram them. We are replacing this unit with a belt drive opener as it is not worth dealing with"
1,dissatisfied,I purchased this product(Torquemaster garage door opener)in good faith the supplier who indicated they had the product and they were unable to fill my order. This occured 30 days ago and they have not refunded my visa card as they indicated the company would.The truth of the matter i do not believe they manufactor this product any more so i used a tried and true product from Sears to correct my problem.If anyone wants to know who the supplier was i will provide!
3,A quite condensed Encyclopedia,"Being one of the man's oldest tools, the knife has a lot of material to work with, trying to sum it up in a single volume of only 144 pages it's really an enormous challenge that the author tries to tame with some success, but to call the book an encyclopedia is misleading, it can be called a good reference, but since it contains too many personal opinions and absolute truths, that can't be upholded even now, that the scientific sense that the word encyclopedia infers is lost; the substantial references to commercial knives and products available only in some places and in a given time (even tough no longer available at the date of the publishing) makes this a short lived and forgettable book."
3,An introduction to current knife use........,"Pat Farey's ""Knives"" is more of an introduction to knives, than a detailed encyclopedia covering specific knives or specific knife types. While a decent introduction, the book does not go into depth and is greatly biased towards knives in current production. It does however cover the essentials, and the pictures are clear and instructive."
5,Fantastic for Beginners!,"Perfect for beginners wanting to learn Arabic. The lessons proceed at a reasonable pace, and the pronunciation is clear and easy to understand. Each lesson is 30 minutes and you do only one lesson a day. Don't exceed this recommendation and try to squeeze in an extra lesson or two a day. The reason for one lesson a day is to allow the learning to sink in before moving on. However, you should budget an hour a day for the lesson, because if you are like me, you will want to repeat the same lesson again that day. The CDs teach the ""academic"" form of Arabic, rather than any regional dialect. As explained, this is roughly akin to learning British English. It might sound a bit unusual in the U.S. or Australia, but it would not hinder communication. Again, this product is ideal for beginners, but anyone with some exposure to Arabic might find the pace a bit slow."
1,Dialects,I am unsure of the discs and set being reviewed but I wanted to clarify some issues with other reviews so that someone can make an informed decision. One has to consider history and there is a soft French influence over Syrian and Lebanese dialect. Once you learn one way the rest are easy. I am Syrian and have a hard time understanding Egyptians because they slur and speak quickly. Here is an example of dialect: An Egyptian may say Kahwa for coffee but a Syrian would say Ahwa. The K is considered harsh and is softened. An Egyptian may saw Farewa for strawberry but we say Fraise like in French. One disc would be repetitive to teach all dialects. If one aims to master a language it would take time and studying and eventually know them all.
2,Why to avoid,"After going up to CD 4 and listening to all previous CDs approximately 20 times each, I got this nailed down very well...Then I started attending the local mosque and tried to dialog with a few people. Often I found that people didn't understand me and I wondered why. Later I started attending Arabic classes and my teacher pointed out to me that I have been learning slang and that the pronunciation is wrong. This set claims to be for Egyptian dialect. My teacher is born and raised in Egypt. Unfortunately for me, I wasted my money and I don't want you to do the same."
1,Dialect?,"Amazon, other book sellers, and the U.S. Government seem to be unaware that there are several very different Arabic dialects. In fact at times in the past they were viewed as Arabic languages. Unless I know what dialect this product teaches this product is useless."
1,Sometimes salvage is junk and stays junk,There wasn't a single idea in the book that was worth reproducing or even marginally inspirational. There are much better books out there.
5,Really fun book written by two awesome sisters!,"This book has great ideas in it, and I was thrilled to find it. The women who wrote it come from a Vermont family that is just awesome. I went to UVM and shared a room with Mary Ann, the author, and I know these girls are just too much fun. I loved the book and anyone who is crafty or creative will love it too."
1,Very disappointing,"A very disappointing book considering the write-ups in home decor magazines. Out of 50 ""original ideas"" on how to use common items in uncommon ways, only 2 were worthwhile. An example of one of their ideas was to make paper hats out of newspapers. Better to get the book from the library, definitely not worth purchasing."
1,Silly Salvage,A review for all serious and dedicated readers of salvage and secondhand goods.I am glad I did not purchase this book thanks to another's poor review of the book. I borrowed the book from the library. I flicked through it very quickly. I did not want to waste my valuable salvaging time.I did not receive any inspiration in the text and photographs. I thought the majority of the projects were a bit on the silly side. Very impractical was my husband's comment.This book is not directed 'in my mind' to the pursuits of the practical and style savvy salvager.
2,The Salvage Sisters' Guide to Finding Style in the Street and Inspiration in the Attic,"I bought this book for my sister; both of us like to look for and re-use junk. After I received the book and took some time to look through it, I realized that a lot of the book deals with sewing projects, which is not what was suggested by the front cover."
5,Very detailed book on REAL Masonry.,"Though I was looking for some clue to the meaning of the Craft, I found a spiritual side not often referred to by most Masons. This book has it. Thank you Don."
5,Does anyone ever read the material?,At least this book was written with the TRUTH in mind and not a lot of Bonehead nonsense like Hoffman's book.Bradley's books on higher conscious are the best out there. He takes no money or royalties for his work - how many of you can say that about your masonic scholars?
1,Don't waste your money - this book isn't even worth one star,"This book is a complete waste of money. The cutesy ""encryption"" of key phrases (C... and S...) is annoying enough, but the authors arrogant assertion that true students will be able to understand what he is *not* saying really takes the cake. Blather and new age B...S... I'm certain that Freemasonry deserves better."
2,My energy frequency didn't vibrate with this Atmic triad,"I truly believe the author's motives were sincere. He makes a good point here and there - though those points and discussions are far from original. What IS original is that FAR too much of this book is California-Zen-Atlantian-energy-infusing-chhakra-modality-crunchy-nut-granola non-sence. Unless you're, like, into that, man, forget it."
1,This guy is a first class bonehead.,"Perhaps the worst book ever written about Freemasonry. This book is filled with New Age type mumbo jumbo that has nothing to do with the Lodge. I was very close to returning it and getting a refund. Stick to ""Born in Blood"", the best Masonry book ever. Note: The back cover was the first thing I noticed....this guy looks AND writes like a 12 year old. Save your money."
2,What is this book suposed to mean?,"I don't know what to make of this book. This book makes Freemasonry out to be some sort of new age religion with brothers going through all these 'mystical expirences'. I remember many emotions from when I was becoming a Mason, but nothing like what this books says a canidate should feel. Although the tone of the book is very pro-Mason, I think what the author views as Masonry and what the majority of Masons view as Masonry are totaly different. I see this book as contributing to a lot of miss information that is out there about Freemasonry today."
4,Surprised me!,"I found ""The ballad of beta 2"" lying on a used books shelf, on sale, and brought it just for the sake of it. What a surprise! A catching yet dark plot, excelent writing and a GREAT ending which fits all the missing pieces that the book builds up. I found this book so interesting that i brought other novels by Delany, and i still beleive he is an very underrated writer. 4 stars because it gets a bit too long (for my taste that is), otherwise a GREAT read!"
5,Jusr RIght,"Some books of this genre tend to feature the same activities over and over, or with one-demensional characters. This wins out over several I've read lately. Excellent blend of male/female romance, emotions, plus plenty of kink and BDSM/CP. An actual story that still has plenty of explicit sizzle."
1,can i get a refund?,"This book started off fine, thats why I purchased it. But by the time I got 1/4 of the way through, I was utterly embarrassed to have even read the sample. Talk about depravity!? Eew! I wish I could get my money back."
2,"Favorite ALICE, Lackluster DVD","This is my favorite production of the ALICE books. I love the sets, songs, and casting. It's also very British, which I think adds another great element to the mix.However, skip this DVD edition. I got it, excited to see ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND in widescreen and, perhaps a better print than what's previously been available.No such luck.The DVD appears to be struck from the same crappy VHS version that's been out there for ages. Faded colors. Pan-and-scan. In this age of DVD, quality like this is such a shame."
2,"Interesting all-star British adaptation, but DVD transfer is unwatchable","This is a very interesting adaptation of Alice in Wonderland, featuring a plethora of major British actors from the time this movie was made. Note that today's younger audience, weened on an MTV diet of rapid cuts and incredible CGI, may find this slow. But if one can get beyond that, it's most definitely worth a watch.That said, this DVD transfer is basically UNWATCHABLE. It's not clear what source they used for the transfer, but there are TERRIBLE audio pitch problems throughout the movie, with wow and flutter horribly apparent. This is particularly problematic for a movie like this with a significant orchestral and vocal score. If you have any sense of pitch, you'll find yourself pulling your hair out listening to the off-key strings! The video quality is pretty horrible, as well--worse than standard cable. A real travesty."
3,Good Movie - Lousy quality,I bought this DVD and got it brand new sealed. However it is from a company called DIGIVIEW PRODUCTIONS and the quality of the picture is absolutely horrible. There is almost no color and there are many spots where it appears it was dropped to 15 frames a second or less. The movie itself is very good but this copy totally sucks. This DIGIVIEW copy was produced in Taiwan and it is the worst quality DVD I now own. I would be embarrassed to loan it to anyone.
4,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1972),"Surrealism takes over in this overlong, butentertaining version of the classic ALICE stories starring someof Britain's best actors and actresses. Fiona Fullerton does asatisfying job of Alice, and so do the other actors in their roles. The music was haunting and the songs were catchy. I justfelt this film could have been edited a little more because it is very long. Overall, this film was quite good, as it is one of the versions that stuck closely to book while adding and changing a few things to make it better."
2,The most bizarre version I've ever seen,"I purchased this for my daughter after just having seen Tim Burton's version. She was very interested in Alice in Wonderland so I thought why not... The cover of the dvd I have is different and has definitely been updated to reflect the times. I knew it had to an older version as Dudley Moore is dead now but nowhere on the dvd packaging did it say 1972. If it had I wouldn't have bought it. Yes, it has a big cast but absolutely no budget, and I agree with the other reviewers, the DVD transfer is HORRIBLE. What a waste of money. That being said, my daughter is watching it but I find it too odd."
4,The Only Film Version True to Carroll's Alice,"As far as picture quality and sound quality, this may be the worst I've seen on a DVD. I think my old VHS copy was clearer. Technicalities aside, this is a must see for fans of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. It is the only film to get it right. The costumes and sets are perfect. The make-up is magnificent. The acting is A+. Songs have even been added to Carroll's masterpiece, and they are a perfect match. Keep your eyes peeled for some very famous British actors. The music is absolutely mesmerizing. If you're a true fan of Carroll's novel, this is the only version...I repeat the only version that captures his vision."
4,Alice in Wonderland,Getting ready to be involved in the Alice In Wonderland play this summer. Its good. We rented it online n the kids enjoyed watching it.
1,Not quite worth it,"I am one of those who bought the movie for the privelege of seeing a young Michael Crawford (Phantom of the Opera) running around in a rabbit suit. Once I got it in the VCR, not even that motivation could induce me to sit through the entire movie. None of the actors are memorable, and the general feeling one gets is of boredom and irritation. The movie does follow the book it is based on very closely, making use of special effects to make a live- action ""Alice"" believable, the costumes are remarkable, and Dudley Moore lends a kind of charm to the Dormouse, but the movie loses the magic of the Disney film. This version of the Lewis Carroll classic would be good for ""Alice"" buffs and possibly tolerant children with large attention spans, but it is less than adequate as a form of entertainment during a boring afternoon and hardly does the charming book justice."
2,I couldn't even finish it,"I love Alice, and I love low-budget works full of heart, but this production was so relentlessly mediocre that I just couldn't bear to finish it. The songs are lifeless and as poorly paced as the rest of the performance, and the script lacks any spirit; overall this production adds nothing new to the story, yet fails to convey the charm of the book (or, for that matter, nearly any other production I've seen). As another reviewer mentioned, the DVD itself is unimpressive - the chapters are, as near as I could tell, either random or simply timed, without regard to content. If this production is a familiar favorite from your childhood, it may be worth something (unless the DVD transfer is as disappointing as it seemed to me); if you're looking for something new, look elsewhere."
1,the WORST produced DVD ever,I loved this movie as a child so I thought I'd buy the DVD. I saw one review about the picture quality being prety bad but I went ahead and bought it anyways. I figured a slightly scratchy print would be better than a used video tape with picture rot.I was not prepaired for how wrong I could be.It basicaly looks like they struck this copy from a mutilated 16mm projector print. The print has bad sprocket damage which causes the image to shake on the screen. It seems like they used the bulb from an easy bake oven to project this print. To call the picture muddy would be a compliment. All the life and color has been sucked out of this film. Did I mention that the film wasn't even focused. The sound was pretty bad as well but I'm not much of an audiophile to realy talk about that.Do yourself a favor and look for the VHS version. It can't possibly be worse than this copy.Or could it?:-(
5,This is Alice...hard and gritty....Great Story!,"When I was a wee lad. I'd watch this story unfold on the tele, and as I grew older, I would stop turning the channels if I came upon this playing on the screen. Vcrs made it possible to record this and lazer discs have allowed me to keep it with me always. I fell in love with all the characterizations, and have tried to contack all of the stars from it. This movie has been the love of my life and made Theater a big part of it. I'll love Fiona Fullerton always. And the Lewis carroll my thanks!"
1,Cute but not for walking...,"I bought these shoes for work to wear with my scrubs (with socks). I had to return them due to several issues: The inside lining was too slippery. I went for a brisk walk and my feet slid so much inside the shoe that they felt like they were on fire from friction! Tightening them did not work, as the top of the shoe tore away the skin from the top of my foot, leaving open sores. Even when walking at a normal pace, the shoe kept sliding away from my heel when I stepped. Thirdly, the sole of the shoe is very narrow; it felt like walking in ice skates! These were very cute...and may be great for biking, but not so great for everyday walking."
4,"Dogland, behind the scene!","I am a dog lover, I couldn't beleive the mistreatment of the animals and the love of these animals portrayed by this book/author. Very good read, reminds me of Jilly Cooper, I am an American and enjoy a good british read. Dont' pass this by."
2,"Very pale, not like picture","The stones on this bracelet are extremely pale, more pink than purple. I ended up returning the bracelet because I have amethyst jewelry and it was extremely poor quality."
3,Quote requested,Please quote for the above book Isbn no:0521080134 I dont have a credit card on receiving your quote i shall send you the rquired amount.please include frieght charges also
5,Inspring Story,"This is a very nice and quick read. First, it deals with Barundi and the killing of Tutsi's there, which is lesser known than what happened in Rwanda. Second, Gilbert tells his story in a very self effacing and humble manner. He does not describe himself in any sort of falsely heroic way, but neither as a victim. It is a heartfelt testimony to his village life in Barundi, his love of running and the life he is rebuilding her as an Asylee. Welcome to Texas Gilbert. We're proud to have you!"
5,You don't need to run to love this book!,"First, I am not a runner. This is not a book for runners, it is a book for everyone! There are a ton of emotions in this book. I loved hearing Gilbert's descriptions of his beautiful childhood home and how simple and happy life could be; then my heart would race reading about the massacre and Gilbert's flight to escape. There were cheers during his races and tears for the lives of friends & family he had lost. Gilbert defines strength- mentally, physically, and spiritually. But what I found to be the most poignant was the amount of forgiveness this man has. I thought that if he could forgive these atrocities, then I should be able to forgive anything in my life, as well. Very simply he asserts that someone has to stop fighting, why not begin with him. I have also followed some of Gilbert's life after this book and it is obvious that forgiveness will set you free. He is an amazing man with a great heart and deserves all the best. What an inspiring book!"
2,Not for toddlers,"DVD is very short, could not keep my sons interest. Might be better for 18 months and under. The only good part was the yoga."
5,Great for toddlers!!,My 2 year old LOVES this DVD!! It is great to get the kids up and moving on a rainy day. It's also cute and fun.
5,Favorite!!!,"My 1 yr old only ever really liked ""Baby Einstein""... until this video! And we've tried many others. After watching ""Let's Move"" he does the yoga poses through out the day. When he's watching it he dances around with a big smile... not even ""Baby Einstein"" has that effect on him :)"
5,Just too cute!!,"We have two other 'Curious Buddies' DVD's ('Exploring at the Beach' & 'Look and Listen at the Park'), and my 18 month old just loves them. She's had the others since she was around 12 months, and they've always been her favorites. But 'Let's Move' will probably replace them - it's the best so far!! The songs are great, the interaction with the ""Buddies"" is fun, and it really does get her to ""move""! She'll even stretch and rest when they do. I highly recommend any of the 'Curious Buddies' DVD's, they're all adorable - especially this one!"
2,Doesn't intrigue my son,"I bought it for my stay-at-home toddler, 2 years old, so that we could have a fun DVD that he could move around to while he was stuck inside during the long cold and rainy/snowy winter. Despite raving reviews stating otherwise, he'd look at the screen maybe once or twice then run off and go do something else. It's not difficult to hold my son's attention (Dora, Thomas, and Team Umizoomi command his participation wonderfully), but for whatever reason he finds this DVD very boring and not worth his time. I don't know what makes other kids love it so much, but I had to put it out there that my son has no interest in it in the slightest. We'll try it again with my second child that's due in a few months, but for now it was a wasted purchase."
1,Waste of money!!! Do not buy!,"This was the first kiddie DVD that I've noticed my son showing disinterest for. He loved the Baby Einstein series. Loved the Mommy and Me DVD. This one had boring puppets ""stretching"" and kids at a park setting dancing. The yoga moves were too quick to copy. What a disappointment."
3,Daughter loves Curious Buddies...but there are better ones,"My daughter loves the ""Look and Listen at the Park"" and the ""Farm"" ones. This one has alot of yoga moves in it...and unbelieveably...not much dancing or moving. That's what I purchased it for b/c my daughter loves to dance...but the other 2 mentioned above are better for dancing in my opinion. This one is probably better for kids over the age of two."
1,Nix Just Didn't Work,"There's been a run on lice treatment in Wal-Mart so I only managed to get a couple of boxes of Nix as recommended by the pharmasist. The rest of the family had to make do with the Equate store brand.Despite carefully following all the Nix instructions there were still loads of live lice in the hair immediately after treatment. The store brand (much cheaper with more active ingredients) worked great and those heads were still nit free a week later.Treating a whole family for lice is very expensive so pick something that is going to work first time, and that is not Nix. Then comb, comb, comb and comb again, daily for at least 10 days."
3,Drillbit Taylor,I bought this moviefor my 12 year old grandson. He enjoyed it andtold me it reminded him of some kids in middle school.
3,Entertaining,"This movie didn't earn 5 stars, but it's not such a bad movie. There's lots of funny parts, such as the bodyguard recruiting sequence (I laughed at the Tiger) as well as the scene where the bully is sitting there in front of everyone and still acts all sweet and charming and makes everyone go 'aww'. He bears a strong resemblance to young Hannibal Lecter and doubtless the similarities in physical appearance was intentional.Seeing Josh (Drake and Josh) as the bully's friend/partner was a surprise and a nice treat. Josh certainly has changed from the plump, dorkishly cute kid he used to be on Nickelodeon, and he played a good role as the other bully. Owen Wilson was amusing in his role as bum and then substitute teacher, and Lisa Lampanelli's cameo was hilarious, especially when she scolded her son for calling Owen a bum when before she had been making dirty jokes to said bum. All in all, a decent movie, 3.75/5 stars."
5,5 stars for pure relaxing entertainment,"Before I go into this movie, I have to say that the fat kid with curly hair in this movie has got to be Jonah Hill's little brother (even though he isn't).What brought me to giving this movie a 5 star review is the fact that Owen Wilson (a decorated comedian) and a bunch of inexperienced kids had such great on screen chemistry. I believed everything I saw all the way down to the oblivious principal and slap happy parents. This was an enjoyable experience that is worth the purchase."
3,just okay...,"I almost avoided this movie because of the bad reviews. The only thing that made me pick it up was an extended preview that looked interesting.The first 30 minutes is the reason that I gave this movie three stars. That section of the movie was actually very funny.Unfortunately the last hour dragged and leaves you frustrated thinking about what could've been.The three kids in this movie are hilarious. Almost like the little brothers of the two guys from Superbad.It's listed as unrated, but don't let that fool you. It's really not that rough.It's just okay."

2,"Silly Wilson, You Could Have Done Better","Now, I would draw short of calling this movie bad. It might be silly and stupid, but not really bad. The story was okay, but the execution was lacking. Now, I will call the editing BAD. It seems like half-way through the movie there is a need to ""cut and paste"" some scenes just to get to a drawn out ending. I am also not real sure the casting director did much work picking the ""kids"" for this film. Hollywood must be short on talented child actors. Two stars only because I actually laughed a couple times...other than that it would have gotten the solo star review. Feel free to pass on this one."
2,dougv,"This is a terrible movie. It's very slow moving,pointless,and badly acted.I had to shut it off after about half an hour.Their bodyguard, Drillbit Taylor, is unimpressive and a klutz.Don't waste your money on this film."
1,Boy this was terrible!!!!,"This movie is not funny at all. I think I might have laughed twice throughout the whole movie. Owen Wilson plays the bum that is hired to protect three geeks in high school from being bullied. I usually enjoy mindless, silly, movies but this one is hot garbage. The plot is stupid, and the movie is boring. I would have more fun doing calculus problems than watching this movie. Avoid it at all costs."
2,Wait until it comes on cable TV,I thought this movie would be hilarious because of Seth Rogen's involvement with writing the story but I was wrong. Owen Wilson is okay and you rarely get laughs from the teenage kids. Pretty much a Flop!
1,AVOID This movie,"Despite I am a big fan of Mr. Owen Wilson, I have to say that with this movie he has reach a deep bottom.This movie is not funny at all. If you have extra money, don't invest in this movie; give it to some veteran association."
4,Owen Wilson comedy,Owen Wilson is at his comedic best. How can he be so funny while at the same time be a romantic leading man? That's a rhetorical question.
2,The book is OK,"Really I think the book was all right. I didnt really get to read it all but I got some were. This book was really Thuged Out and it relly had some serious stuff.I loved the first few pages of this book, and then the guy changed gears and took another road that I didn't enjoy. The book became made for TV writing, with all the stuff, funny dialoge and serious plot. Mr. Quinonez has talent, but he's giving it to Hollywood. If you like pop film, you may love this book. The scenes that made this for T.V was the parts with the drug deals and the parts of stealing and robbing. My favorite character was Sapo, I like him because hese relly thuged-out. Chino really looks up to Sapo like a real friend would do."
5,A great book!!,"I know people compare this book to the Great Gatsby and they might be right. It does have lots of similarities, but with its own twist. I really like the poetry in this book as well, I think it gave it a very nice touch. I happy to see all this Latino's writing such great stories, I have purchased Ernesto Quinonez latest book Chango's fire and I can't wait to read it.I also purchased a couple of bodega dreams books a couple years ago as Christmas gift to friends of mine and they loved it. You don't have to be Latino to like these books. Anyone can enjoy them."
2,bodega dreams,"I loved the first few pages of this book, and then the dude changed gears and took another road that I didn't enjoy. The book became made for TV writing, with all the cliches, goofy dialoge and convoluted plot. Mr. Quinonez has talent, but he's giving it to Hollywood. If you like pop film, you may love this book. eiisa@nethere.com"
3,Hollywood ending betrays promising debut.,"I really wanted to love this book. Really. But too many cliches and an anticipating-the-movie-deal ending betray this vibrant debut from Quinonez. At times, the prose flows smoothly and realistically and you can feel the grit and intensity of life in Spanish Harlem. Other times, the cliches are simply too overwhelming. A farout plot twist at the end ruins the whole thing. I look forward to his next book."
1,A Let Down,"After reading the reviews in the NY Times, online, and elsewhere, Bodega Dreams sounded as if it would be an exceptional read. It was not. To say the least, it falls far short of the hype. To compare it to Gatsby is like comparing the NY Yankees to the Toledo Mudhens. Quinones shows skill as a writer only when he is describing Spanish Harlem. His passages about nicknames and his description of a Pentecostal Church are especially on the mark. But the rest of the book simply sags. The plot is flimsy, the writing sometimes sounds amateurish (who edited this?), and the ending is almost laughable (although it is intended to be anything but). Ernesto, I think you've got talent, but stick to what you know, and stay away from the sensational."
2,Clicheville,"I hoped this book would be good; Quinones has received a lot of acclaim for it. Unfortunately, this book is bad. Instead of subtlely or finely discussing the oppression, racism, and harsh reality his characters faced, Quinones preaches and divulges information in a totally unbeleivable way. There are the occasional well crafted phrases and sections, but they are drowned out by the horribly cliche plot and unbeleivable story line. I'm sure the numerous references to Spanish Harlem will ring true for those from that area, for me though, they didn't add much. Instead of just mentioning ""la marqueta"", why not reveal the nature of it? Reference after reference seemed to have only one purpose, ""name dropping"". As such, it grew tiresome. Notwithstanding the fact that my review is negative, I appreciate the fact that people are writing stories from the urban Latino perspective; I just think we can do better."
1,"This book sucks big time, mad stupid, another slum novel.","I hate this novel, superficial, misleading and full of despair. Noir in the worst taste. The hero never realizes that once you dishonor yourself you have hurt yourself and your community. The reparations are not to set up detox clinics while still selling drugs. The hero ""takes down"" the lawer and the cunning Vera but he does it because they killed Willie Bodega, a ""nice"" organized crime hancho, from whom the hero had gotten favors. The hero, a college student speaks spanglish ghetto ebonics, hmmm. All the time. There is that marvelous twist toward the end but the reader has no hint at it, it just comes out of the blue."
2,I read 'The Great Gatsby' too.,"While Quinonez deserves props for articulating a vision of Spanish Harlem (and for selling a first novel about it!), he has simply taken every element of 'The Great Gatsby', from plot to use of narrator, to the ending. This, I'm sorry to say, is not original writing. I'm amazed it was published. For an authentic, original take on this subject, I recommend 'Always Running', about the LA barrio. But if you liked this book, perhaps you'll love Quinonez' next novel: it's a tale of a Puerto Rican prince who can't decide whether or not to kill his uncle, who murdered his father."
4,bodega dreams,"Bodega Dream is a fiction book that has lots of every day people goes through. I am glad that I had the opportunity to read this. The character Chino is introduced. He is a hard worker that meets a girl, Blanca who later married him. Then there is Sapo he received his name from his feacual futures. Sapo works for a drug lord named Bodega. Sapo introduces Chino to Bodega, chino then start working for him. The writer has captured a view that other people will never see."
4,The Reviewer,"Bodega Dreams is a very well written book. I was able to connect to the book and relate to the real life events that take place in it. It does have profanity, but nothing any high school students cant handle, or dont use. The book kept me hooked and wanting to know what happened next. I would definitly recommend Bodega Dreams to any highs schooler."
2,Written for the Movie Rights,This book is too heavy handed in its political message to be taken seriously. Quinonez obviously wrote Bodega Dreams with the aim to broker a movie deal. The characters are uninteresting which is really amazing because there is so much potential for great dialogue and suspense. Quinonez's weak writing style is magnified by his insistence to endlessly spell everything out for the reader. Bodega Dreams offers nothing new to the discussion of the urban environment.
3,Enjoyed it,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a story that was set in a place that hardly ever gets heard from. As a non-Spanish speaker, I was a little put out by the use of Spanish and not knowing what they were saying. The end provided a twist that I didn't expect. Good, quick, read."
4,A Lot of Promise,I was lucky enough read an advanced copy of the book and was surprised to know that the author visited one of my favorite stomping grounds - the International Salas Museum on 116th and 3rd Avenue. The Author describes the owner and location in terrific detail (with the exception of the ties explained in the book). It was exciting to read about it and meeting the author was thrilling.The book was great. There are a few faults but nevertheless it is a great read. Ernesto is a promising writer who I look forward to reading again soon!
3,The ways of spanish harlem,"This book wasn't exactly one you, ""just couldn't put down"". Overall it had a great plot line and well thought out ending. Also, there was swearing but just to the point so you could get the full effect of how they live their everyday lives. I think the main thing you need to keep in mind when reading this book, is to go in with an open mind towards other cultures and ways of life. The reason I believe that Bodega Dreams wasn't appealing to me was that it starts out very slow and stays slow throughout most of the book and then has a good but not so happy ending. If you have to have an action packed book this one isn't for you."
3,ANI DIFRANCO SWINGS INTO SOME HITS & MISSES.,"I love this lady, she is original, refreshing and completely beyond the norm of pop.However her latest ""Swing Set"" an EP with 6 songs, 2 of them are an album version and radio version of ""Swing"" falls a little short.""To the Teeth"" is a really good remix, as for the song ""Hurricane"", but the live version of ""Do Re Me"" is a little short of embarrasing and the other cut ""When I'm Gone"" seems poorly produced.A little disappointing but if you are a DeFranco fan ""Swing"" and ""To The Teeth"" make up for it."
4,Spirit is a wonderful lift!,"I did not want this book to end. I wanted to stay in the world created by Gregory Shaw in ""Spirit"" forever.This is the way I feel when I read books from authors like Eckhart Tolle, Byron Katie and Gary Zukov. Like these remarkable authors, Gregory Shaw has an important message to share, and fortunately for us, the ability to share it in a clear and entertaining way. Spirit is thought-provoking and insightful.I highly recommend it to anyone interested in living a happier life, and in doing so, improving the quality of their... afterlife."
5,Spirit: A story of Death..and Life,"Purchased a book that said was worn, spine may be cracked, and had basic wear and tear. I figured, for $.01 who cares. When I received it, I was absolutely amazed. There were no defects that I could find. It was exactly like a brand new book. I would encourage everyone to make your purchases this way."
5,Spirit: A great read in more ways than one!!,"Gregory Shaw's work, Spirit, provides insight and spiritual guidance to those living through the entertaining story of a man's adventure in his own afterlife. When I picked up the book for the first time I had no idea that it would affect me to the degree that it has. Through his book, Mr. Shaw has changed the way I view my own life and beyond; I believe that I have greater awareness of my physical self and spirit. I highly recommend Spirit and have already shared it with many others!"
3,Another good addition to the Hellboy franchise...,"Finally got to check out the second Hellboy animated movie. I came away from it the same as I did the first. It was good, but I'm sure true Hellboy fans are the ones who really appreciate this. The animation is solid and the NR rating leaves it open for plenty of blood but not as much violence as you might think. The story about the vampire queen trying to make her return was interesting; though a little slow at times. Even though I realize part of the plot involves the vampire queen making a deal with the goddess Hecate to return, it still seemed a little forced at the end when we resolve the vampire's story only to go into a big battle between Hecate and Hellboy. Don't' get me wrong, it was a cool battle, it just seemed a bit forced into the story. Overall, I like the characters and will continue to support any projects that come out, but I doubt I'll ever become a true fan."
2,Ok,"I love Hellboy! I enjoy the comics and the major motion picture. The animated adventures are just ok to me. Not as fun as the movie, but they will do until the sequel comes out."
3,A CUT BELOW LIVE-ACTION HELLBOY,"I'm a big fan of the movie Hellboy, which is the only reason that I watched the animated Blood And Iron. However, I'm not a fan of cartoons. So, naturally I wasn't blown away by this. Sure, it had some good humor, and the animation was topnotch. It's just that it had a kiddie feel to it that kept me from really getting into it."
3,"Fun, but not great","I rather enjoyed the first animated hellboy movie, but was a bit disapointed with the follow-up. Don't get me wrong, its entertaining, and does not do anything particularly wrong. The trouble was that one of my favorite aspects of Hellboy lore is the crazy out of this world creatures. Blood and Iron involved a more traditional vampire story. While entertaining, it was not what I was hoping for. Thus, I would recomend to animation fans, I'd caution Hellboy fans to take it with a grain of salt. They'll enjoy it, as long as their not looking for the usual hellboy crazyness."
4,Love Hellboy,"I'm a huge Hellboy fan. I love the books, the movies are amazing and the animated DVD's are tons of fun. Blood and Iron is visually amazing with art work done by Cheeks Gallow. If your a hellboy fan you will love this DVD."
3,Beautiful but...,"This book gives testimony to the love that the Mother has for us all. However, as it includes the stories of people of different faiths and views of life, some parts of it are not ""very catholic."" So if that is what you are looking for..."
5,finishing for needlework,A great way to finish needlework if you are tired of framing or pincushions/ pillows. Clear instructions and many shapes of boxes for many uses.
1,claim,Several weeks ago I bought a bag and the provider has not yet sent to my address. You currently have no qualification to me. if you'll be sent warning
2,Not so hot,"The handle is too flimsy to make this product useful to everyone. Those having trouble washing their legs could use this product, as well as those that want a very light pressure washing their back. All others would do well to select something else."
4,Beautiful prose by Mishima,"The Sound of Waves, by Yukio Mishima, is the second book I've read by this author (The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea), and I can see the similarities in styles. I wonder if I'll recognize it in his other works.In The Sound of Waves, a young, poor Japanese fisherman is transfixed by the daughter of the island community's richest man. She returns his affections, but dissatisfied suitors begin a campaign of rumor that tarnishes their relationship, particularly with Hatsue's rich father.Author Mishima makes it clear that he had a critical eye regarding the topics and places he writes about. The reader feels the drudgery, and importance, of the various activities in a fishing community, plus the politics and dynamics of a small town. The ending can be faulted as being vapid, but still satisfying. Mishima seems to leave plenty behind for the imagination."
4,"Great, uplifting story of romantic love","The Sound of Waves is, simply put, a story of romantic love woven from the simple life of a fishing village in post-war Japan. Mishima's book doesn't include vast social criticism, but rather hearkens back to a world where common people have simple dreams, and where right wins out in the end.The highlight of the book is perhaps the descriptions of people and nature, and especially the way nature affects people. Butterflies are signs, but Mishima makes clear that it is people who make them such, and not the gods. The sea and village are both backdrops to Shinji's and Hatsue's romantic coming of age, and their romance is on their own shoulders with only the feelings and ambitions of their rejected alternatives to stand in their way.A good read for any time when you're in the right amorous mood."
4,Simple and charming,"I read Mishima's ""The Sailor who fell from Grace with the Sea"" years ago and while Sailor got rave reviews, I actually preferred this story.Mishima masterfully weaves a simple love story that, despite its Japanese setting, is evocative of youthful love everywhere. The sensitive protagonist is a hero the reader will root for from the first page; of course, it's partly a fairy tale we've read a thousand times before, where the peasant (fisher boy) falls in love with the princess (bourgeois daughter). There are no dragons slain in this tale, however, except those of personal dilemmas and our hero's inevitable rivals.A charming, heartwarming tale of unforgettable characters told with Mishima's trademark poetic simplicity."
2,Oih.,"I was forced into reading this book by my Language Arts teacher, as a comparison to Romeo and Juliet. The book had excellent discriptions, but I'm afraid thats it. The plot was dull, you couldn't get to know the characters at all, nor could you begin to understand them in any way whatsoever. I would have given it a 3 if it wasn't for the last sentence, which left me angry and irritated, I won't go into it incase someone else actually wants to read it to find out, though I suggest against it.Also, there are some fairly graphic scenes with discriptions that I really didn't want to read."
3,sound of waves?,this book is okay about 2 teeangers who fall in lve. nothing special..i had to read it for school and i was pretty much bored all the time but if you really wanna read this go ahead if u r in to all that love stuff
1,Umm.... really.,"I'm going to be incredibly blunt, cause that's just the way I am. I'm in HS English 3P, and we're reading Sound of Waves, by Yukio Mishima. The book put me to sleep every time I tried to read it. I was bored out of my mind, and you will be too if you bother with it. Just tell your teacher some *choice advice* and save yourself some problems, okay? DON'T READ IT!!!!"
1,Horrible book,"This book is awful, boring, has no real excitement and is disgusting. Do not read, I do not recommend this."
5,Mishima is brilliant.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and consider it one of his finest works. It's subtle presentation and simplistic beauty just makes it an amazing story. It is HIGHLY recommended to anyone who wants a purely beautiful story. If yer looking for Stephen King or Robert Heinline, you'll be disappointed--however, if you want something with some soul, READ THIS!!"
4,Sound of waves,"This was a homework asignment project. The book was interesting but it would not be my choice for pleasure reading. Nothing wrong with the book or writing, Its just not my type of book to read."
5,My Favorite Japanese Writer,"This book is not like all the other love novels because it seems to deliver from a different background (actually, it does deliver from a different background). If you have read The Temple of the Golden Pavilion by Yukio Mishima you may like this book. And if you haven't read the Temple.....then you should. This man was a genius, many saw him as disturbed as many geniuses were/are in fact. And for a little more background information, Yukio Mishima was the final person in Japan to commit honorable seppuku which is honorable suicide. Check it out."
3,Yukio Mishima's Fairytale,"Sound of Waves is a typical love story that takes place in an idyllic Japan. It has many elements which was very perdictable, Boys meets Girl, Boy falls in love, etc. As I see it, this is Yukio Mishima's thoughs as to how Japan should achieve modernization without losing tradition values. The author of this book was an extreme patriot and lived during the second world war. I suggest this to anybody who enjoys good romances. This book does though lag in any real exitement, but that's how fairytales are.If you actually read this, e-mail me and give me some feedback if you read the book."
5,Messy was never so cute,A charming story about white dog and a messy day. Count the dots and count the spills.
2,A Re-Release of an Earlier Book,"Dated, wordy and not one of her best. The focus is all over the place, although the book is written as mystery meets romance. Reminds me of the soap operas DALLAS and DYNASTY. Life is too short to re-read old books of this caliber, though Delinsky's more recent books are high on my list."
5,Pleasant surprise,"This is the first book I've read of Delinsky's and I enjoyed it very much. It's labeled as fiction but it was a romance and mystery all rolled into one. I especially enjoyed the interaction between all the family members. I will be reading more of Ms. Delinsky's work. If this book only rated an average of 3 stars from its readers, imagine what a 4 or 5 star book must be like!"
3,unusual story line,"This book would have been rated higher by me if there had not been repeated descriptions of explicit sexual scenes. It deserves an X rating for sexual content. I did enjoy the story line which I felt was a bit unusual. However with so so many different characters mentioned in the first few pages I almost gave up because it was difficult to keep them straight--which names belonged to which family, etc. I did decide to stick with it and gradually all the different names began to stack up for each family involved. I have read other more recent books by this author and don't remember such x rated scenes or I would not have picked this title up at my local library."
1,Needed a mortgage payment?,I strongly don't reccomend this disc! It doesn't compare with other efforts or current offerings from contemporaries.
3,distorted,"excellent material, with a great performance by buddy, but the disc has too much hiss and distortion, this 5 star performance deserved a better transfer to cd."
1,quality - exceptional,"The Cd arrived is good conditon, promt & am satisfied with the qaulity of the sound."
3,A bit light on techniques but good at what it does.,"I'd rather pay a bit more and get more techniques such as in Artist Trading Card Workshop: Create, Collect, Swap by Bernie Berlin, BUT this book is worthwhile in that it covers a few things about how to cut paper without waste into the correct sizes and the techniques aren't for the most part covered in the other book or various others I've looked at, so I wish this volume were larger, but for the money, you are getting a good book. I'm still very glad to have bought it."
3,Showed a few good techniques,Thought this would have more info. It showed some good techniques and had some good ideas. I can't make up 3 more words . . .
3,Entertaining enough,"This novel featuring (and narrated by) Hammett's anonymous Continental Op is able to offer a more complex plot than his short stories. It features the Op's usual dogged approach to the case (""You've got to sit down to all the facts you can get and turn them over and over till they click.""), but does not revolve around Hammett's usual set of underworld denizens and trench-coat-clad gunslingers. Overall: another entertaining ""hardboiled detective"" yarn, but I personally prefer the more corruption-filled underworld feel of ""Red Harvest"" (the Op's other novel-length case)."
3,not quite up to snuff,"I think this is the weakest of Hammet's novels. It is a bit predictable and the whole curse thing is a little silly. Nevertheless, you should read it if you are a big Hammet fan, because he wrote so little."
4,"Oh Yeah, The 80's",I remember when I was much younger that I use to love to look at pop culture mags from London. There was a certain look that I was drawn to and little did I know that Ray Petri was responsible for this. The book is a nice show case of his art and the editorial very interesting. It also is a reminder of how we have lost so many of our artists and others to Aids. Books like these are nice celebrations of their lives not their deaths. It's a great coffee table read.
3,An interesting video but slightly dated,"For someone who has some knowledge about aircraft this maybe a good video to acquire, it explains the basics about the air accidents but lacks the depth that some air enthusiasts may expect. The video clips were interesting but most were dated, clips of 707s, DC-8s and early 737s. I wouldn't say that this video is disappointing, however if one is looking for up-to-date and breathtaking clips I wouldn't suggest it. If you are interesting in the aftermath of a crash and the proceedings then it would be enlightening."
4,Shoegazing at its finest,"I suppose if you cant have the Verve this would be the next best thing. Cool vibe to the disk, I love it."
3,They aint no Verve,"The first track definitely rocks, but most of the album is a little droning and a tad gay. I was a HUGE Verve fan and there are spots where that magic comes to the surface, but overall some pretty weak songwriting in my opinion. A nice fill-in for people desperately missing the Verve, but nowhere near as good."
5,Loved this oldie but goodie,For you Prince fans this one was produced by the Purple genius himself. I've had this music once but my tape broke. (LOL) I'm so glad I was able to find the CD. Check out the last track...Time waits for no one!!! Awesome.
1,mavis staples never really gets to belt,"MUST TO AVOID, unless you think that Prince is infallible. I feel like I'm listening to a different cd than the other 2 reviewers. I agree that it is totally a Paisley Park thing but not in a good way. Staple's vocals are muffled or just there to say some silly Prince throwaway lyrics - nothing like her performance on ""Melody Cool"" on the ""Grafitti Bridge"" soundtrack where she owned that song. I feel like I'm wasting my time even listening to this cd when I could be listening to some REAL Mavis Staple from the 70's."
4,Good book in a simplistic way,"My wife bought this book on a whim. She left for the weekend and this was my weekend entertainment. My wife loves romantic ethnic type novels and I assume that's why she bought this. I like baseball so I decided to give it a try. I am not really into romantic type novels but this book was compelling enough. In the northeast we have lots of Gypsies here so that to sort of got me curious.It is what it says it is. It is basically what this guy Austin is dreaming to be in the future. He goes through Vietnam, his own problems to finally get the chance at his dream and the story follows along well enough.There is one chapter that goes a little too long. The ending is not a ""normal"" ending as it is not what I expected at all. But still it was entertaining and a quick read. It makes you think differently about Gypsies."
4,historical fiction of General Joe Wheeler,"There are two quotes on the back of the book from lead staff at the the General Joe Wheeler House and Museum; which suggests that this is indeed historical fiction related to General Joe Wheeler, and it is. Wheeler, while not a lead charachter, is a re-occuring subplot. A nice touch is the Universalist minister who shows up in the middle of the book - historicaly very accurate, just not much done in fiction. The war material also seemed right. So, historicaly it does seem accurate. The few famous walk-ins seemed right (nice to see Pingree and Rogers, but where's Clayton, Andrews, and Fuller?)It was a fun read, I enjoyed it."
2,Some info about this single,there is cd 1 and 2 of this single and a combined single with both versions on the 1 disc. Tracks for the 2 seperate singles are as follows1. deeper underground (radio edit)2. deeper underground (metro mix)3. deeper undergound (instrumental)1. Deeper underground2. deeper underground (ummah mix)3. deeper underground (s-man meets da northface killa dub)Overall these singles are duds. The only midly interesting remix is the ummah mix which puts a semi urban hip hop feel to the song. Otherwise the lead off track is the only other decent song. Get the version which incorporates both cds into the 1 issue for better value.
2,Great until for 4 days,"This was the hit of Xmas for our 23-month old. The remote worked very well and was more advanced than some of the other ""beginner"" RC cars. He couldn't care less about the animals--dumped them out and never touched them again--but was entranced by his ability to control the car.However. He was carrying it about a 6 inches above a tile floor and dropped the car. That was that. It stopped responding to the remote and he was very unhappy.Note Discovery will not help w/ the warranty; they direct you to contact the manufacturer. We have not gotten a response yet."
1,An erotic trifle that is not exciting or amusing,"The movie raised great expectations in my mind because Miou-Miou was the main characters, and the first several scenes were amusing enough as the reader encounters some excentrics (esp. the general's widow and her maid). But the ""reader"" deteriorates into prostitute that caters to the deviant, kinky tastes of the clients, and i did not find that interesting or amusing (or exciting). Why would Miou-Miou lend her name (and body) to this failure of a movie?"
3,"i would not recomend this book to rice fans,the curious,yes","the book lacks the dramatic writing style thatrice has and she is deserving of. the authorexpresses to much of her opinion and needs tofocus more on the facts of the book. anne hassaid she worked with katherine on this book,but it seems she was ignoring the significanceof a book like this, please don't take this adisgrace to our anne, but the book does not isnot deserving to the vampire chronicles. it isdisorganized and is based simply on the fancyof the author. who, to me, it seems, has not cometo understand the deeper meaning of the vampirechronicles. as anne herself said, they're not justabout vampires, they're really about us, ourlives, our great and beautiful minds."
1,Disappointing,"More an attempt to cash in on Rice's genre with far less enjoyment than that which was provided by the graphic novels and movies. Unless you like reading the encyclopedia or the dictionary, there's really no reason to purchase this book. Fans of Ms. Rice already know these facts."
4,"A fantastic read for the lovers of the brat prince, Lestat.","This book has everything that a lover of Lestat and the other vampires could ever want. The facts are so great to know! If you ever wonder about something within the book, you can always check back to the companion. A constant information source for loyal and interested fans of Rice and Lestat."
3,"Unusual, Interesting but too rethorical","It's a great book to have for us Anne Rice Vampires, but it's sooo drawn out and it gets to the point where it's repeating itself. I had to skip 40 pages because I had already read it in the beginning a hundred times! But Anne Rices Vampire novels are the best, do read those, you won't be dissapointed."
4,NO rash & slim profile,Runs small so go up a size. It fits well under jeans/ pants & good knee support. No big brace bulge. Did not cause rash/ allergy reaction like neoprene products do.
2,Not Convinced,"This is comfortable to wear but it slips down very easily. Also, the steel springs do not offer much support nor protection to prevent injuring your knee joint."
2,Poor construction,"This brace provides fairly light support and compression. It provides more lateral support than just a knee ""sleeve"" -- but not substantially more. I would definitely not recommend it for anyone with significant knee weakness. By itself this would merit a 3 or 4 star rating. Unfortunately, on my third use of the brace the top portion tore. I cannot tell if this is due to the relatively light material out of which it is constructed, a design flaw, or a flaw in the manufacturing process (or some combination of the three). Given that the brace is tight (it must be to serve its function), it should be built substantially enough to hold up to more than three pulls (which are required to put it on). Not a horrible item, but there must be something better on the market."
4,Thanks for the CD!!!,I heard this mixtape at a party and I was buggin out over his beat juggles and cuts during/in-between the tracks. He chose a perfect selection of underground classics that complent each other very well in terms of feel. Very impressive.
3,"Good, sound early Sabatini","This is a good, sound, albeit early and somewhat weak, Sabatini novel. It's his first in the setting he handled best, revolutionary France. The style is mostly vintage Sabatini, though the plot is somewhat weak by his later standards; the ending works both intellectually and emotionally, though the mature Sabatini would have come up with something more satisfying. The plot, as usual, is assisted by coincidences and characters acting in the one way they would obviously avoid; but it avoids the unacceptable holes of most of his earlier novels."
1,Unpatriotic,"Hodge's ""Redefining European Security"" does not even dwell upon the fundamentals of defense and military strategies. Its a hodgepodge of basic definitions cut and pasted from some of Europe's local newspapers and from ""un-named sources."" Truly, the European experiment, most notably Britain, while less drastic in it's security failures, was discouraging. This is in complete contrast to Hodge's Conservatist bias."
1,I bought this,I bought this and it did not work well at all. The picture would often distort and go completely out. I sent the units back and that was the last I heard of them. Company would not respond to calls. I never got them back. Absolutely no customer service.
4,Good product,Good product. becareful though if you want to wirelessly play video from your pc to your tv because you will need rf link apt 2000 pc to tv adapter also which is an extra $70
5,Excellent,"I bought it in Feb 2006, never had any problem. Occasionally it stops working and just restarting both the units (sender and receiver) fixes the problem. I am so satisfied I am buying another pair."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"Totally useless, this is the third AV signal sender I have owned. This unit cannot send a signal without terrible breakdown in picture quality."
4,Wireless reciever means no more cable & sat boxes for little used TV's,RF Link AVS-5813 Wireless Audio/Video Receiver (5.8 GHz)Works great. You can send one signal to as many receivers(I have 3) as you need in the house.The Good: enables you to send a signal from one tv to another. Strong signal reception. Small and unobtrusive. $80 per receiver means in a year means for the 1st year it costs $7 per unit.The Bad: Won't transmit an HD signal. $80 per receiver means in a year means for the 1st year it costs $7 per unit.Bottom Line: Buy it
2,"purpose good, longevity [oor","The first pair I owned lasted quite a long time. Then failure started. I replaced the transmitter and it was Ok, then the receiver failed. I gave up and ordered a whole new set, per my last order and hope thtis will last me a long time. It is expensive to have to continue buying replacements."
2,Works for a While...,"I really liked this unit (and its transmitter unit twin), but only for as long as it actually worked. It works well sending signal from my TiVo in the living room to my office, where I have a TV monitor and the audio running through a decent sound system on the computer. I really like the capability to use the TiVo remote from the office. However, after a few months, both of the transmitter units I've bought have died. (I've bought full pairs both times.) I can still get audio, but the video feed is gone. I'm to the point now where I'm looking for alternatives."
3,Good luck getting any information about this item from RF Link!,"After I purchased the transmitter plus receiver, I purchased a 2nd transmitter. It came with no description, instructions, or information. I got it to work but the red light in front doesn't come on and it doesn't respond to the remote control at all. I called RF-Link and sent them emails they didn't return my call or respond to my emails. They don't have any information on their website under downloads about operating the 2nd receiver. Hence, I can't tell if the 2nd receiver is defective or if it isn't capable of responding to the remote control."
2,Works only half of the time,It works only some of the time. It's totally unpredicable and the picture on the tv screen rolls quite a bit. Not recommended.
2,worked but with poor audio quality,"Even when I placed the units inches apart with no obstructions, the audio quality was poor, with noticeable hum and hiss. I give it 2 stars because it did work, and I think it could be acceptable if you didn't care about fidelity, e.g., for an intercom. But I doubt anyone would accept the performance I was getting for music."
4,Easy and effective,This product works as advertised and is easy to install. I still can't believe the quality of picture and that it works so well.
2,Subject to interferences,"I had a 2.4 Ghz wireless set but it has a lot of interferences from the microwave oven so I decided to buy this one.When we talk about microwave oven interference, this 5.8Ghz works well. Since we have a tv and a receiver in the kitchen, we can use the microwave oven and it doesn't interfere at all with the TV signal transmitted from the living room, but the bad side is that its signal is interfered by any moviment in either the rooms, even if we are not in the direct signal way. If we move our arms, hands, head the image gets interference and the sound gets noise. We are strongly considering moving back to the 2.4."
2,IR dead on all three pairs,"Within six months, the IR capability on all three pairs that I purchased ceased working. Agree with the poor quality observations made by so many others about this product. Amazon should really think twice about carrying this product."
3,"Pretty good system, but unreliable.","The tough part is adjusting the receiver's antenna to get a clear picture. If you can do that, no problems. I had purchased this same set 3 years ago. When the receiver unit failed, I ordered two separate replacement receiver units, however, neither worked with the original transmitter so I wound up having to buy another complete set. Reliability and good craftsmanship are definitely not traits that I could attribute to this product."
4,works with less interferance,I used to have I think a 900mhz version that fuzzed out when ever...there were numerous interferances. This one works quite well given the same interferences. I am very happy with it.
1,Useless thru brick walls,Forget about this video transmitter if you plan to use it behind a brick wall. It won't work even 15 feet apart.
1,Unit failure,Unit just failed transmitting/receiving video in a year time. The audio is working but the video image kept rolling/blinking. I transferred the set to another cable box (I got two cable companies) and had exactly the same problem. The price is too high for a very short economic life of the equipment.
1,Totally Frustrated,I received this item and it proved to be defective. I have returned the original item and Amazon has been promising me that they would ship the replacement for over a month now but has failed to make any of their estimated ship dates. Right now I am looking for another source and about to cancel the order.
4,"Apparently variable, but I got a decent spread","As promised, 100 Condoms, with a bit of variety. Half Durex (of 4 different styles), a quarter Crown, and the rest split between Elexas (by Trojan), Lifestyles Warming Pleasure, and Kimono MicroThins. I might have liked a wider selection, but I can't really complain. Only thing that kept this below 5 stars was that four condoms expire in only six months, and another six condoms expire in less than a year. It's not a problem using them before then, but a longer lifespan would be preferred. The other 40 are good for at least four years."
4,Good Deal but.....,"I got 99 condoms (one missing is no big deal); but, they were all Durex, is alright thought, the Durex came in good Variety, and for 20 or so bucks is still a good deal.Condoms I got (all Durex)......""Extra Sensitive"" 25 Condoms""Intense sensation"" 24 Condoms""Maximum Love"" 26 Condoms""Performax"" 24 CondomsThe condoms are no wear near expiration date (Earliest expiration dated is ""2013- 06"".)It came VERY discreetly to my mailbox and fast too.I didn't give a full 5 because I WAS promised other brands beside just Durex, and that one missing condom is just human error w/e."
3,Boring,"There were 100 condoms in the box but I wouldn't call it a variety pack. There were a few different kinds, mainly all from the same manufacturer. It'll do."
2,not as many as advertised,"I purchased this item, and instead of receiving 100 condoms as the product description states, I received only 85. I am hesitant to do business with this company again."
4,Repeat Cx,I think this is the 4th time I have ordered from CMan I love the Variety Pack. 60 % Durex (4 or 5 types) 25% Crown 10% lifestyle 5% Elexa and 2 kimono's. Would have liked to have had a few more Kimono's But Cant complain to much well worth the $20. Will Buy again
1,Buyer Beware,"I thought this would be a fun gift for a friend's birthday. I expected the 100 condoms would come in some sort of cute box or package that described ""condoms from around the world"" etc. I also ordered a box for myself. What I ended up getting was a plain white US Post Office box with some handfuls of condoms thrown in. (Possible 200? I haven't counted.) Certainly not a fun gift item I can give to a friend. I've tried contacting CondomMan to return the items for a refund, and ten days later have still heard nothing back from them. Learn from my experience--don't waste your time with this vendor."
5,A great deal,I got more than 60 Durex and rest other products they mentioned. I got all 100 and its a good deal for 20 bucks....
1,Very bad experience,"BE CAREFUL!! Please don't waste money to buy troubles. I got 28 pieces of CROWN brand and 72 pieces of BEYOND SEVEN brand in a bubbled envelop. Not a variety pack at all. There is no DUREX,no LIFESTYLES, no OKAMOTO as shown on the picture on Amazon web site. Those two brands are all made in Thailand and I have never heard before. I asked a return but the seller asked me to drop to the post office marked ""return to sender"" first.( They saved the postage for returning and didn't trust that I would return.) I asked the new shipment should be DUREX, LIFESTYLES, and OKAMOTO only. Unfortunately, I still got 12 pieces of CROWN brand and 24 pieces of BEYOND SEVEN brand. I drop these two unknown (may be fake) brands products (36 pieces, i.e. 36%) to trash can already. This is a very EXPENSIVE AND BAD experience from Amazon. This seller is totally not reliable and not trustworthy."
1,WARNING: YOU'LL GET RIPPED OFF,"WARNING: DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. YOU WILL GET 100 DUREX CONDOMS, WHICH YOU CAN BUY FOR 10 DOLLARS AT COSTCO. THERE IS NO VARIETY WHATSOEVER I AM FILING A CLAIM TO GET MY MONEY BACK BECAUSE I FEEL I GOT RIPPED OFF. THE GOOD COMMENTS ARE PROBABLY FAKES, MADE BY THE SELLER THEMSELVES. I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS. YOU WILL GET RIPPED OFF. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! YOU WILL NOT GET ANY VARIETY! AWFUL.WHAT I AM ANGRY ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT THEY ADVERTISED A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS, OR AS THEY PUT IT ""100 Condoms Variety Pack : CondomMan's Collection of the World's Best Condoms."" WHAT A JOKE, YOU WILL RECEIVE ONLY DUREX BRAND CONDOMS. I AM FILING A CLAIM, BECAUSE THE ITEM IS NOT AS DESCRIBED BY THE SELLER. AGAIN, YOU WILL GET RIPPED OFF."
1,Terrible Product.,Junk. Useless. The cord rewind broke the first day.It cost more to have it shipped to me on the initial purchase than this piece of junk was worth.Never again. Stay away from these rude people.
2,Needs improvements!,The kids love this thing--it's a GREAT concept but needs to be improved by gemmy. It's too big for 3 fans and does not appear like it's in the pictures--very lopsided and hard to get straight. It is not very well made--had mine all of a week and there was a hole in it!!!! My husband sutured it back together but for the price-it should be more durable. I have tons of other gemmy products and they are great but this one needs some serious tweaking--please GEMMY--make it new and improved for next year!!!!!!!!!!
3,P. Williams,"I saw the one on display, and it looked great. Mine does not seem to have enough air to fill it up . I have checked everything in the instructions (no air escaping from open zippers and no holes). We are going to have to suspend it between two trees to get it to work right. I think it is just too heavy for only three fans.....it needs a fourth one.w"
1,Gemmy products Haunted House,"I swore never again I would buy a Gemmy Product after all the trouble with a Ferris Wheel that was less then a month old,and had to be taken apart be someone and rewired because it came poorly wired from Gemmy.I found the 12 foot Haunted House at a yard sale for 3 dollars,and at least I have a year to mess with it.When I tryed a test run on it,I found that 3 blowers were not enough,but for3 dollars I will get it to run nicely and to stand up by itself,that is all Gemmy products are worth to me is 3 dollars,and the customer help is none,they are as stupid as the day is long,but like I said 3 dollars no big loss if it does not work,it can be pitched!"
1,Poorly Done,We have many Gemmy Inflatables and this one is poorly made. They need more than 3 blowers and to be honest we don't have anything in our front hard to really hold this up properly. We are returning this and I hope that they recreate this awesome design but we are returning this item.
3,Not sturdy!,"We LOVED this item in the pictures, but it is poorly built. It can not stand on it's own. We have attached metal stakes to all corners and the tower to make it stand."
2,Just too small,"I found these speakers just to small for my use. I have a pair of KLH's 98b's 2 way and I like them very much. The Twistables are just to small and can't put out enough sound to keep up with my other KLH's. I used the twistables as replacements for a pair of 6"" two way AR's and the twistables just can't create the same sound filed that's needed in my surround setup. They can be driven very hard as the main pair. I will order another pair..."
3,ummmmmmmmm,if you think you have a really bassy system.......i recommend you get these because they will really make your system sound better..........sorry but these speakers have absolutly NO BASS!!!!!!!!!!! but i think i have solved the problem.........no air intakes!!! just drill a hole through the sides and they should sound a little bit bassier. but don't do it if u think you will mess it up.......
5,Lost of Soul,"The movie really made me understand on how the NAZI during that days, really destroy people's heart and mind. many intelligent and creative minds in those days were raped of their root, and forced to comply with NAZI's idea. this film reflect how a genius mind can be crippled to the lowest level. let us learn from this horror, and never to repeat it anymore."
4,Blueberries For Sal,I attend West Virginia State College. My name is Mary Cook and I am taking a children's literature class. The book would be appropiate for preschool children. The blue and white drawings give you the thought of blueberries. The book teaches sequencing of events and comparing events to small children.
5,Good Book,"My son is almost 5 years old and loved ""Make Way for Ducklings"" by Robert McCloskey (RM). My son had a loose tooth and a friend recommended ""One Morning in Maine"" by RM. So, I bought that as well as ""Blueberries for Sal"" and ""Burt Dow..."". He loves all of the books by RM. ""Burt Dow..."" is his favorite and ""Blueberries for Sal"" runs a close second."
3,Everyone likes blueberries,"This is a good book for kids because animals are in it,and they talk.It's about a five-year-old;his mother and a little bear,and its mother. The two stories parallel each other and children can compare the two stories. There are pictures on every page. All the pictures are in blue. It's simple to read,too. If I graded this book I would give it three stars."
2,bland,"I don't understand the positive reviews here or the caldecott award. The sketchings are artistically done, true, but in a way an adult can appreciate intellectually; they don't really evoke emotion. The story is a yawner."
4,Classic for a reason,"This is a simple book of a Little Sal, and Little Sal's mother, and Little Bear, and Little Bear's mother, who get mixed up with each other on Blueberry Hill.It's very realistically written and illustrated, and the exciting part isn't too scary for little ones.I will note that it's a bit long - maybe better for kids with longer attention spans than shorter ones. If they're as young as Little Sal is, it might be better to wait a year before reading :)"
5,Great Book,"This is a classic that I read when I was growing up. The illustrations are great and the story is wonderful.Note that if Amazon is the supplier the book may be damaged, part of the back cover of my book was missing! My copy was sold as new and with no note that it was damaged. Be sure to inspect the book when you receive it!"
5,Love this book,This is a classic that we happened across at a used book store. What a great story and book!
5,A wonderful romp through the woods...,"My daughters and I love this book. I've been a fan of McCloskey since I was a kid myself, and I was pleased to be able to find this book re-released for my own children. It's a classic, and one that belongs on the shelf of any parent with wee ones.The story is simple, two mothers (human and bear) take their children out berry picking, where the children wander off, and manage to switch places. The pictures are charming, the plot is lovely, the text suitable for a young reader to read themselves, or for younger ones to have read to them. All in all a wonderful children's classic, don't hesitate to buy it."
4,I like the art...,I have always been a fan of Natalie Hertz. Her art just catches my eye.I am happy with the deck.Only things that bothered me is how the cards stuck to each other when first opening the container. And on some cards there is this pinkish smear on the back of them.
4,A Very Pleasant CD for Little Ones in the Car,"I picked this up for driving around music and was very pleasantly surprised. Quite enjoyable (and my son seems to like it too!) and perfect for exactly what it says--traveling around. Easy listening and could possibly make your child smarter, great!"
5,Happy Baby,I recently sent this cd to my grandaughter for her daughter who is 7 months old and cranky in the car. Grandaughter tells me the baby is quiet listening to music which makes her life easier!
5,COOL!,"My baby, the dad and I love this cd! It makes car rides FUN! She relaxes and sleeps too!!!Whoever buys it won't regret!Baby Einstein must know what they're doing cause it is really amazing."
2,Selection is not good,This tape is short and the melodies are not engaging for kids. It was waste of money.
3,Not entirely satisfied...,"It was meant to be a gift for my grandchildren but, unfortunately the box arrived broken. I hope the little ones will enjoy it, anyway. Don't know yet how it sounds since I didn't want to tear the wrapping before giving it as a present."
2,Pretty disappointed,"This case is not terribly useful. It's really thin and flexible. The padding feels like open cell foam inside, so it's REALLY squishy (read, not very sturdy or supportive). There's no rigidity whatsoever on this bag. it's good enough to use at home as a dust cover, but it's about as useful for taking the guitar outside as a garbage bag. I'll be looking for other options with better protection.This was a gift, can I still return it?"
4,unappreciated music.,"while this cd is the best they have out, you will either love it or hate it. a mix between the essential damien rice and equally needed radiohead, this album works for me. heartfelt, with raw emotion. no qualms here."
4,Can You Trust What i Say?,"If there's a Frames' album that deserves to be recognised, it's ""Burn the Maps."" This album has everything that's current. If you're an indie fan, you should enjoy the grand basslines and the sometimes-soft-somtimes-abrassive vocals of Glen Hansard, that are presented on this album. They sound much more ambisious and sound as though they've expanded their musical vision.Check it out; i've learned that no matter how well-written a review, the music must speak for itself to your naked ears."
2,1st time Frames fan,"I bought this CD on the advice of an Irish rock critic, some message board praising and a snippet of a song. Turns out this may not have been THE Frames cd to purchase first. Seems like every song starts with 3 - 5 minutes of whispering and bare bones instrumental backing then it gets going for a minute and then it is over and the same process continues on the next 10 songs. This is tough CD for a first-timer to slog through, it will take some convincing to purchase another one of their CDs. I will check them out at Lollapalooza since their live shows are praised highly here."
2,Great band - not so good CD,"While I love the Frames, and would definitely recommend checking them out live (they are quite possibly the best live band I have seen), this is not where I'd start if I were new to the band. For me, the album lacks one important thing: tunes.It is possible that the album is a complex masterpiece that will grow over time, but I've listened to it a dozen times now and it still does nothing for me. On the contrary, I think ""For the Birds"" is a wonderful, immediate album, so that's where I would start if I were just discovering this band. (Dance the Devil is a good alternative)."
4,not bad,"its not bad, its brilliant if your a frames fan. but i suggest if your a newbie buy fitzcarraldo or dance the devil.much much better than burn the maps.and go see them live they are fantastic."
4,Movie Review,"I thought this was a pretty decent piece. As usual, Robert Carlyle delivers fine acting as he portrays an inspector who seemingly chases his own personal ghosts as he investigates the murder of several classmates of a class of '76. While there's nothing ""touching"" about it, I found the plot to move fluidly, the characters true to form. I also found myself wondering as I neared the end what would happen and ""whodunit"". So it was worth the few bucks' rental to get a good Carlyle fix. He never lets me down."
2,Atmosphere galore & fine acting... but oh so slow.,"This is the type of movie that the Brits do better than anyone -- carefully paced, beautifully filmed, ethereal, and just a little bit haunting (or maybe, haunted). Usually I really enjoy this type of flick; I'm patient & easily seduced by atmosphere and pretty scenes. And the shots of Stirling, Scotland really are pretty (this area was home to William Wallace, aka Braveheart, in the 13th century).But MONROE is long... I mean really long. And slow, really slow. So by the time the end slowly crept up on me, I was oh so sleepy. For me, there's just a little too much careful pacing and atmosphere. Once in awhile, something (anything!) needs to happen... besides another elegantly-framed, bloodless death (there are a bunch of those).I watched to the end, but I was pretty bored by then. Maybe that's just me... or maybe you, if you're not up for a long (two-part) BBC mystery that unfolds... slowly.You decide for yourself."
4,This book is good to a Introductary level of Lean manufacturing,"I would like to recommend that people who read this book try to get ""Running Today's Facotry - Charles Standard & Dale Davis"" in depth."
4,Good Reference,"I bought this book to help me figure out how to make sure my infant was receiving all the nutrients necessary and also to help with the transition from just formula to eating regular meals. The book didn't help with information on the transition, but I still think the nutrition information is great.It has good tips on how to keep feeding time from becoming a battle and good tips on how to start your children out on the right track to healthy eating.The information on what NOT to feed your infant is also extreemly important and could prevent many choking incidents!"
5,"Fred Jackson, Hootin n' Tootin","This is one of those albums that didn't sell when it first came out, but it's getting revisited by the younger generation like us.Fred Jackson, wasn't the most known recording artist for Blue Note, nor was he the most popular, but the cover art seems to be a BN staple.Fred Jackson was basically a rhythm and blues saxophonist, and for some reason, he wanted to play jazz, so he got together with some musicians and recorded this album.All the tunes are blues. This is most definately a soul-jazz ocassion. The songs are groovy, the melodies aren't exactly genious, and the album swings. This album might be anything from a classic, but its nice to sit back and groove to."
2,The Reign of Terror Had Never Been So Dull,"Theres little need to give a synopsis of the story, as that has already been done in almost every other review shown here. I don't know why the director chose to use painted cityscapes, rather than actually make the movie on location. The artificial backdrop in front of which the characters parade make the movie seem dull and lifeless and I found myself watching the film with a certain amount of detachment, not really feeling involved wih the people or their lives. If you want to watch an exciting film about the French Revolution, buy A Tale of Two Cities instead."
5,pry my FAVE french visual movie!,"always loved this movie version, yet never owned it. glad i can thank amazon for allowing that. it's a great film, classic even. i am so glad i own it - it is definitely one of my visual favorites thanks to amazing, cutting edge (for that time period) technology."
4,The Lady and the Duke,"This is an excellent movie. It shows that History is very often better than Fiction. Also, showing the backgrounds or settings as paintings is very well done. I watched it once for this alone.D."
4,Too Blue,"I saw Jeanette Wilson on the Woodsong program, or was it Jaming at Hippie Jack's, and liked her and her band. I enjoy this in MP3 format. Some of the content is Gospel Music and most is not. I like the picking and the most of the recordings."
4,Good music overall.,"One song that sticks out is ""Who's afraid of Detroit""it catches you and does'nt let go. I absolutely love the composition/elements on that one. Others are decent."
2,Too small,Too small for my Eclectus parrot. She destroyed it in about 1 hour. It was way too small for her to stand on so I hung it from the cage.
4,Didn't Last Long,"This was a great toy for my Amazon. The wood was quite easily chewed though, meaning that it didn't last long (nor did the other toy I got from them with wood blocks in it.) The only thing left it is plastic chain."
3,It's OK....,"The product description says it's firewire and USB compatable, however it only ships with a USB cable. Also it can't be daisy chained to other hard drives, which is something I've been able to do with all my other external hard drives.Also it only has 150 GB out of the box, not 160 (which I know is the case with every hard drive out there - but why don't they just say that so you know exactly what you're getting).That being said, the price is good, it's fairly small and can be positioned horizontally or vertically, and the one touch feature is neat."
1,This drive will not last,I bought one of these and used it as extra storage for about 6 months before it died. Maxtor shipped me a replacement that has lasted about 3 months. Now it too has died. Don't trust your data to Maxtor. Their products are awful.
2,Brass latches don't match the satin nickel handles!,"While these are great looking door handles, for some reason the latches on these were brass, and did not match the satin nickel finish on the rest of the hardware.Thanks to Amazon for offering a partial refund since I already had these installed and it would have cost me even more to have them all removed to be shipped back, but still it doesn't make sense why it didn't match."
2,Facing Mount Kenya,"I believe it was supposed to be almost new.It was very used and even had yellow highlights throughout the bookThe price was right, so it was OK but it wasn't almost new as advertised"
4,Bustin' boundaries,"This is the CD single version of The B-52's hit ""Roam"". There are 5 remixes of the song, plus the b-side ""Bushfire"". ""Roam"" is a great song, but the problem here is that the remixes don't sound all that different from each other. It would have been more interesting if they some more radical remixing. Here is the track listing:1. Roam (7"" Remix)2. Roam (Radio Mix)3. Roam (12"" Remix)4. Bushfire (LP Version)5. Roam (Extended Remix)6. Roam (Instrumental)"
5,Casey Jones is my new favorite female PI!!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and cannot wait to ""spread the word"" that Katy Munger's heroine is a perfect combination of guts, gams and good humor. It was the most entertained I have been by a book in a long time. The mystery was clever, had a surprise ending and best of all, made me laugh out loud at least a dozen times! I truly hated for the story to end - but when it did end - I was very appreciative of the way Ms Munger ""wrapped up all the loose ends"" Can't wait to read all the previous adventures of Casey Jones."
1,money to burn,terrible book. i couldn't finish it. the figures of speech and symolism were trite and the so-called humor wasn't funny. couldn't recommend this to anyone.
4,Frustrating,"WARNING! I ordered a Digipower, but I received a Generic ""Premium TECH NB-4L"" Battery from Hi-Tech Savings.. It is 900mAh though and lasts longer than the original battery. I tested it and my result were; The low battery icon doesn't pop up until around 385 pictures and lasts longer than 400+ shots with the flash on. My canon SD450 was set to Auto & the highest image settings & flash on.. Don't order from them if you want a REAL Digipower. I hope this helps."
1,decieved,"I bought this battery as a package deal with my cannon camera thru amazon and the battery does NOT fit in the charger, therefore it cannot be charged. I had a very important event coming up and was depending on the extra battery and now I do not have one."
5,Nice Replacement Battery,I purchased this to keep another battery charged for when the main one dies. The only thing I didn't like about this camera was it takes non-standard batteries. But you kinda need this with today's smaller cameras. I charged the battery OK but haven't had to press it into service yet.
3,False Advertising!,"I'm not very happy at all. The original battery in my SD1000 is 760mAh. This battery is also advertised as a 760mAh, and I PURCHASED what I thought was a 760mAh battery, however I received a 600mAh battery! I bought this battery as a spare and was hoping to have the same run time, or slightly longer, but this one actually lasts a little less, obviously. But at $2.55 it's not really worth the time and trouble to complain and/or return it. Just beware!"
5,does the job,I've been using this as a spare battery for about 6 months now and it works as well as the original Canon.
3,Beware of battery capacity,"I ordered two of these, being careful to order from Amazon itself, not a marketplace member, in order to be certain that I got the Digipower batteries and not some other brand. Amazon did indeed send me Digipower BP-CN4L batteries, but the capacity per battery was only 600 mAh, NOT the 790mAh shown on the battery in the product picture and stated in the technical specifications section. I complained and was offered the choice of returning them or getting a 20% discount. I took the discount, but would have preferred getting what was described.....So, buyer beware!"
3,Double check compatibility,"I ordered this battery as part of a bundle offered by Amazon for a Canon PowerShot A3100IS that I bought as a gift. I didn't check to make sure it was the right battery for that particular camera since Amazon was offering it as a bundle. Just make sure you double check you are getting the correct replacement battery. Canon PowerShot A3100IS takes NB-8L batteries NOT NB-4L, which is what this particular battery is designed to replace. Boooo Amazon for offering a bundle of incompatible items."
4,I must concur.,"The mixes for Blue Savannah on this single are nice, to be sure, but it's the B-side ""Supernature"" that makes the single worth buying. A word of advice: Crank it!"
3,"Great song, Weak mixes","""Blue Savannah"" was truly one of ""Wild's"" best songs back in 1989 so when this maxi was released, i expected more than what i heard....THe Der Deutche mixes were very weak (especially II) and took alot away from the original emotion of the track itself. now, the Mark Saunders Remix? Now we're talking!! the song was magnificent, epic, and a masterpiece! i think the remix alone is worth the price of the CD. ""Runaround on the Underground"" is fantastic in 12"" remix form with lucious pianos, but try to find it in its original version, it's precious and lovely (and shorter!) Supernature (remixed by master William Orbit) is great but a little cluttered the original (on the Hard to find ""You Surround Me"" UK single) is more fun. And ""No GDM"", well....that's another show altogether....CIAO BELLAS!"
5,Important news for horseowners,"Jaime Jacksons study of feral horses led him to the knowledge contained in his first book, The Natural Horse. In his latest work he guides horseowners through a very difficult transition. There exists a deeply ingrained tradition and blind acceptance of the ancient practice of shoeing horses. Unfortunately shoeing horses is not good for them. Jaime explains why shoeing is detrimental. In a very clear and concise way Jaime walks horseowners through the education and practical processes of deshoeing. Every horseowner owes it to themselves and their horses to at least read this book."
5,A Really Fun Book!,"Funny illustrations, a funny story--my five year old loves it! He first had it read to him at preschool and it was a big hit with all the children in the class. We then borrowed it from the library, and now we own it. It's great fun to read out loud! We like it a lot."
1,"Great movie, bad DVD","This movie is one of my favorites. It is absoloutly amazing and heartwrenching. But this DVD is crap. The subtitles have errors, swear words are added - sometimes when nothing was even said - and there is even a scene missing. This is a Hong Kong DVD, so perhaps it was censored, though I have no idea why seeing as there was nothing bad about the deleted scene. Also this is NOT a region 1 DVD, so it will have to be viewed on a laptop or a region-free dvd player. I returned my disc, and I suggest you find a copy somewhere else."
5,Cat doesn't mind,We have a special breed cat who requires extra Taurine. He was given to us and had not been used to the medicine but he doesn't mind it at all and the other cat doesn't either. We put it directly on the cat food.
2,ok but a bit too strong in fragrance oils for my taste,the tea seemed fine but the fragrance oils were too strong for my taste. i could not taste the tea. they need to be more subtle with a green tea. too bad because i am really looking for a good one to replicate the one i usually drink from france which i cannot get any longer.
2,Can't see the ingredients list,Ditto to other reviewers concerning the originality and flavor of these recipes. They make the book a 5 star but the ingredients are listed in a light lime colored ink which makes them very difficult to see under the best of conditions. The book would be a keeper if it weren't so difficult to use because of this.
4,Love this cookbook. Want more recipes!,"I found this cookbook at a yard sale a couple of years ago. At first, it seemed like a passport to the exotic, but, soon after it became a guaranteed good meal any time I opened it's pages. From smoked chicken/hominy/triple-chile soup to mango-banana upside down cake - these dishes are unexpected and good.I will warn you though, it does have some hard to find ingredients. However, I live in a small town and still was able to find most of them nearby or online. The soups and entrees in this cookbook are sure to please. If this book reprints, and you would like to try something different, give this book a whirl."
4,A note for Sandy Denny fans --,"Reportedly, Sandy Denny was romantically entangled with Jackson C. Frank for a time in 1966 or so and she recorded two of his songs -- ""You Never Wanted Me"" and ""Milk and Honey"" -- on her folky, voice-and-guitar debut album, now released as ""The Original Sandy Denny."" So, Denny devotees would do well to check out the source of her early inspiration in Jackson Frank."
5,Superb! One of our favorite albums,"We have owned this album for 3 years and still return to it again and again. Unusual combination of instruments - haunting, spiritual, soothing.Came looking for more Steven McNamara and saw no review for Yogitar so had to stop and say - amazing work. Thank you Steve - look forward to more of your music."
3,SAUCE MOTHER#$%^&*MONEY,"WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT CAT?I THOUGHT HE WAS JAY'S BOY.THIS ALBUM HAS ITS GOOD MOMENTS BUT,YOU FIND YOURSELF WANTING MORE FROM THE KID WHO RIPPED THAT VERSE FROM ""RESERVIOR DOGS""OFF OF JAY'S 3RD ALBUM.GETTIN BACK TO BEING JAY'S BOY,SO WAS JAZ,AND SO WAS ONE THE GREATEST MCEES OF ALL TIME-BIG DADDY KANE,WHOM JAY HAS NEVER HAD ON HIS ALBUMS.WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?HOW CAN YOU GIVE A CAT SO MUCH PROPS AND NOT HAVE HIM ON YOUR ALBUM?KANE AND LL WERE DOING AND SAYING SOME OF THE THINGS WACK RAPPERS SPIT TODAY ON THE BLING BLINGS AND SUCH.ANYWAY,YOU CAN PEEP SAUCE FOR THE RIGHT PRICE OR JUST LISTEN TO HIS VERSES ON JAY'S JOINTS."
2,2.5 Stars. Lukewarm. Hit-and-Miss album of 2000.,"Sauce Money has established himself as one of the most gifted and talented writers in hip-hop history. He has also established Middle Finger U, as being one of the most enigmatic releases in hip-hop history. The best way to describe the album on an overall level, would be a total hit-and-miss. You have a hot beat here, a flaming flow there, and an incredible rhyme two tracks down. This album has the potential to grow on you, but only if your open minded."
2,Sauce Money should be Saucy Money,I thought this would be a pretty good cd but I guess everyone is a thug and gun holder in this hiphop stuff these days. I liked the cut with Premier and the rest are alright. He does say some stupid stuff and some the beats are kind of next generation type but with a played out mentality. All in all buy it used!
2,condition is not as stated.,"when i ordered it, it was stated that it was in very good condition. when i got it, the case was broken, there was tape on the case and the CD also was scraped up. it barely works, so i just burned it to my computer. this was NOT in ""Very good condition""the album is great though."
