2,something to consider,"I am a lefty and when i first started out i saw this book and thought it would save me.But if you go to the end of the book it tells you to get used to reading guitar tabs ""right handed"".which is great advice but you just spent a whole book getting used to left handed tab form.Arrrgh! I love being lefthanded but if you do not get used to reading right hand tab rightaway it will be very frustrating.It takes alittle time but you can do it.You just have to look at the tabs like you were looking through the back of your guitar neck.Try it,you will see.While this book can teach some helpful things ultimately you will have to unlearn and this is unproductive.Please take my advice from one lefty to another."
3,not for the newest of players,I got this book to go with the lefty guitar my son wanted for Christmas. I wish there were more pictures for finger placement that might help someone who is just learning the strings.
4,Great but you have to practice!,"There was no magic here but couldn't have done it without this book. I'm 54 years old and wanted to learn to play guitar. Not a lot for lefties. I purchased this book in March of 2011 and worked pretty hard. I figured it would take me six months at 5 hours a week. That was pretty much right on. I've been playing now for nine months and continue to practice 5 to 8 hours a week. By using this book, it has made it easier to translate right handed material. Still struggle with the transitioning of material but not beacuse of this book. I also thought it would take me two years of regular practice to play songs with confidence. That appears to be the case as well. I use this book now to go back and review as well as a reference source. I will say that at times it was not well exlained so I was set to guessing. Other material helped in some clarification. Amazing how the material the second time around is easier! Worth the investment! Good luck"
3,"It's ok, but not ideal.","This book wasn't written by a lefty. It is good, but the CD has a guy playing the chords and a drum track. For this beginner, that's too busy for me to hear what's going on. It's still good that the notation is set up for a lefty."
3,review of left handed guitat book,book was fine but was missing CD that i believe comes with the lesson book. item did come quickly and was packed securely
5,Works perfectly,"Digital interconnects either work or they don't, this one works. The picture on my HD projector looks great and you can't beat the price. The quality of the cable and connectors is decent as well, no doubts it will hold up over the years. I don't know why you would pay more for an HDMI cable."
5,Works Great,"I got this cable to connect my DVR(which is in the bedroom) to a second TV in my garage (35 Ft away), and I was concerned about the quality of the HD picture after reading some of the reviews. The bottom line is that it worked perfectly (on a 720P). I can't comment on how it would work on a 1080P but I would guess it would be perfect as well. Great product at a great price."
2,Could have been great,"This CD follows the all-to-common practice of presenting a dozen of the ""most marketable"" pieces, leaving off the more unique music. Where is the great electronic composition from the beginning, the wonderful practice piano music, and the other instrumental selections? A complete soundtrack, given courage and dedication by the CD producers, would be more unique, engrossing, and worth owning than this selection."
5,This Chicago Girl Loves This Film!,"I love this movie - and not just because it's a 'Chicago' film. It tells a lovely story about the life of a dancer, and showcases the dancing of the Chicago Joffrey Ballet and of Neve Campbell, who I understand had to work gruelingly to get into top ballerina shape. She worked very hard and it shows in her dance of ""My Funny Valentine"" - truly I don't know how you top that as a ballerina - it was the ultimate performance. Malcolm McDowell always plays his parts well, and James Franco was great in a very early role of his career.Robert Altman has always been one of my favorite directors (Gosford Park, The Player) and to me The Company ranks as second only to Gosford Park."
3,Nice Vac but Narrow Hose :-(,"I bought this vac to replace our wall mount Shop-Vac, because the hose was too narrow and was constantly getting clogged (it was 1.25 ""). I did tons of research and thought this was going to be a winner BUT alas, the hose on this vac is narrow also. THE 30' HOSE DIAMETER ON THIS VAC IS 1.25 INCHES. For some reason, it's impossible to find the hose diameter for this vac anywhere :-( A diameter of 1.25 is fine for vacuuming out your car, but will clog from typical shop type mess (sawdust, etc.) Some vacs have 1.75"" and 2.50"" diameter hose available.So, I'm returning this one (bummer) and still searching for a conveniently sized shop vac with a wide diameter hose..."
4,Good Buy,"I bought this for my barn and have mounted it on a dolly. It has great suction, very versitile, and durable. I would highly recommend it."
2,They could have spent more time designing the attachments..,"I have had this vacuum for about a month now and I find that for one, the main plastic piece on the end of the hose is not air tight, which of course creates a loss of suction. After putting a piece of duct tape around it the problem seemed to be fixed, the problem now is that I have a brand new vacuum that looks less than classy.Also, some of the attachments that connect to the end plastic piece are angled in ways that make it hard to vacuum without having them spin around when you use pressure on it trying to vacuum out a car. When using certain attachments, I have to hold the the end in multiple places just to get the attachment to stay and not do a 180 spin on me...The vacuum itself is a simple, sturdy and stable design but the attachments are not. You can tell they probably spent no time testing this with the attachments."
4,good device,"Very heavy and large but has powerful suction and a very long hose.It takes up a lot of space the garage, but has the power to suck up leaves, dirt and all the stuff that gets on the car carpets or the garage floor"
5,Terrific,"Very nice set, good suction, convenient storage accommodation. The very long hose is great and not too hard to manage and roll up. Vac itself is not too heavy to lug around the house, thinking of fashioning some sort of carrying strap."
5,What a sucker!,"I first saw this vacuum in the in-flight magazine on a recent flight to Texas. I got it on Amazon.com for a hundred dollars cheaper with free shipping and better price. Love it! My garage floor stays so full I cant get to my shop vac to roll out, but this mounted on the wall where I just pull out the hose and I'm ready to vacuum all over without moving a thing. Powerful suction, all the attachments you need for any job, and reaches all the corners and outside!Thanks, Toni"
2,Cheap.Cheap Hose,"4 stars for vacuum. 2 stars for attachments. 1 star for hose.With all the good things about this vacuum, I can't believe Hoover would cut costs to this extream. The hose was crimped on arrival and even if it was not, I would have sent it back. This would be a great plastic(thin) hose for a toy vacuum, NOT for use in a garage or for vacuuming cars. Hoover really got sold a bill of goods on this. Hoover does not have a better replacement hose. I will look for a better replacement vacuum as soon as I go thru the trouble of returning this one."
2,"Overall, okay","I had mine for just inside two years and the just motor burned up! Also, I found it was rather loud, but I would use hearing protection. The length of the hose was nice as were the attachments. I have a Craftsman shop vac that is about 20 years old, costed less and much more powerful; so I will probably use that from here on out."
2,Worked for a while...,"Had motor problems after 2 1/2 years of light use (perhaps once/month). Filter was cleaned regularly and basket never more than 20% full at any time. Ultimately replaced it with a different garage vac. Given all the positive reviews, I can only guess I had the one bad one in the batch. ;)"
4,"Great for what it's good at, not so much anything else.","I'll keep this short, so people don't feel like they have to read a book to get an opinion.The GUV works great at smaller cleaning jobs. It can clean a car very quick, it can pickup messes in a hurry. But, it lacks the power of a true shop vacuum system.The GUV just isn't as strong at picking up. But, unless you need a serious blower or something, you should be fine."
3,guv,"I like the vacuum but I feel it is underpowered for a garage. When you have a 30 ft hose, additional power should be available. The concept is great, it hangs neatly, and is easy to empty, clean and put back together. I have a woodshop in my garage and it does great on the sawdust, but small pieces are harder to pick up. Extra power would be great."
3,pretty good,"This is a great car vacuum, as long as you're not looking to vacuum up bowling balls or small animals you'll be fine! the attachments are useful, the hose is plenty long enough. The unit is quite noisy and I would suggest mounting it near the garage door so any dust can exit the exhaust of the vacuum. overall, a good deal for the money."
4,Great garage vacuum,"I was looking for a good garage vacuum to use cleaning cars. This one really fits the bill. Great suction, good long hose and useful tools. All that and no bags to replace, makes for a very useful tool. It looks very well made and was easy to install."
5,Works Great,Works great and has all the attachments needed to do a great job. Great product for the price. Would recommend.
5,Works Great!,"I purchased this vacuum about two months ago and I am very happy with it. The power has been sufficient for my needs. The low volume of the motor and fan running is a definate plus, I can sweep a vehicle and carry on a conversation with another person at the same time. I had read that cleaning the filter was a chore, I have found it to be quite easy. I just remove the collection tank and wrap a garbage bag around the cleaner, then you can reach up into the cleaner with your hand on the bottom of the bag and just rub it around on the filter. The filter cleans up quite nicely that way, when you are finished just empty the tank into the same bag and you are done.The mounting, general appearance, and tools have all been satisfactory. The long hose is a plus. Two of my friends have bought these as well after seeing mine. It just works very well!"
2,Better mounting instructions needed...,"I am disappointed with the instructions for mounting the vacuum and hose brackets to a wall. They only give you three screws but only give the instructions for ""lag bolts"", which are not included. What gives?I can't recommend this unit to anyone until someone can give me clear instructions on how to mount the vacuum brackets and the hose brackets."
1,No time to run,"I can't say how well this unit works because I never ran it. When the unit arrived I noticed a little rattling going on, so because I'm curious I had to know what in the h-ll is wrong with this thing,low and behold upon removing the top of the unit (suffering a laceration on the old fergini)I discovered not to much to my suprise that the plastic motor housing was broken and the bolt to plastic standoff was stripped. I put the unit back together (taking care so as not to recieve another laceration) called Amazon got a return authorization and set her back to wence it came. I got my refund in a timley fashion and all is good. (except I'm running out of band-aids)"
4,What is the correct amperage of the GUV???,"I have hesitated to purchase this unit because of conflicting information concerning the motor amperage. The description clearly states 10 amp, while the promotional video below the description touts it as 12amp. My research on the internet by other vendors does not help the 10 vs 12 amp question. They all have the same model number!! Could this be a classical ""Walmart marketing strategy"" were a company with large purchasing power dictates to the company (Hoover) which accessories they do or do not want and alter the product ever so slightly (10 vs 12 amp) in order to offer the seemingly same product at a lower price point. 10 or 12 amp this is the question??"
1,didn't work on arrival,A total waste. I did not install it for about 6 weeks after arrival as I was still painting the garage. After I did install it I turned it on for the first time and it made a buzzing sound and starting smoking from the top.Called Amazon and was told as it has been more than 30 days they have nothing to do with it anymore.So now I'll have to deal with hoover. I probably just got a dud but wish i got it at sears now as i could take it back and let them work it out for me.Saving $25 with amazon was not worth it in the end.
1,Dust scattering machine.,"After all your garage work sanding a piece, how about lifting those fines and distributing them evenly. It will also make your house smell like burnt pet hair when used inside. I've learned tool/garage/shop vac means inferior filter and ability to suck dry sumps (of the latter, there is no mention of wet/dry to this vacuum ((I haven't read the manual, just a user)). I abuse household vacuums now and have luck replacing bag filters and tossing a device with a handle around the shop. I guess this product's hose is long-enough to place the vacuum outside; if not, I'm in for an awkward lift or a wheeling of top-heavy device on a 2x16"" round platform with tiny coasters IF I can find a path in a busy garage."
1,Motor problem,Motor burned up after very little use. $95.00 + shipping to replace it. Stay clear of this unit.
2,Switch failed after 100 days,"Switch failed after 102 days and hoover refused to fix and or replace the unit or even send me a new switch.Sparks came out of the ac switch area, caution should be used when operating this device."
3,"Pres don't have much headroom, but OK for pop recording","I had high expectations for the Mbox, mostly because of the Focusrite pre-amps, but was very disappointed. Tried it for recording classical chamber music w/ small diaphram omni spaced pair in a hall that has really outstanding acoustics. Biggest problem is the lack of headroom - makes it next to impossible to set good levels for music with a large dynamic range. Also had intermittent problems with stutter, which may be solvable with different cache settings, but I'd already decided the package wouldn't be right for me, and wanted to return it before wasting more time figuring how to tweak it. Plan to try the Presonus Firebox, once it's been reviewed. If it's anything like their Firepod, the pres should be excellent, and the firewire interface should be more stable than USB."
3,Pretty happy,"Overall, I'm pretty happy with Pro ToolsIt takes awhile to get used to, but editing audio on here, after awhile, becomes quite easyin particular, as a filmmaker, I have been very pleased with Pro Tools's ability to edit dialogue tracks of movieshowever, in order to do that, you need the DV TOOLKIT, which costs another $1,500!!!!Sadly, without the TOOLKIT, OMF files cannot be imported into Pro Tools ---- keep that in mind if you are purchasing Pro Tools for dialogue editingotherwise, its a pretty solid package, and the MBOX is easy to hookupHAPPY SOUNDTRACKING!!!!!!!!!"
1,the Pro Tools doesn't work,I can't review this product because the pro tools software is too old to my Mac and my Pc.I hate this situation!!!! Maybe the product is fantastic but without software what can I do?
5,Digidesign is the best.....bottom line,"I bought it, and it shipped to my house faster than predicted. The setup was very smooth; there was no problems at all. The seller included a plethora of software disks. Fully compatible with pro-tools 8 LE. The only complaint I have is the lack of multiple outs for simultanious monitoring, but with a single splitter I'll be just fine. I've been waiting a long time to use pro tools. I will certainly be getting the newer model in time."
5,One of the best writing books,"My copy is dog-eared and full of high-lighted notations. As a fiction writer, I wanted a guide to help me write more vivid scenes. This book showed me how to use sensory details without overloading the reader. It also shows how to make your reader become a part of your story by mixing action and description. The book is not only for fiction writers. Her concepts are also applicable to non-fiction, essay, memoir, and poetry writing. Each chapter includes writing practice exercises. It's not a typical how-to write book which focuses on the ""rules of writing."" It's a must-have for anyone who writes anything.~Rita Marie Keller, author of LIVING IN THE CITY"
4,Word Painting: A Guide to writing more discriptively,"The book, Word Painting, is aptly titled. I am enjoying it and have learned much about how to take my writing to another level. The explanations are simple enough to be understood, but expressive enough to look forward to what could be.Kathy Stevens"
1,Here's an adjective: Yuck,"Weak, unconsidered, cliche ridden, mundane, obvious, repetitive -- How are those for a few descriptions? Well, they fit. This is not a good book. She repeats the most obvious and then repeats them again (where was the editor?). Some facts are just wrong, such as most scholars see simile and metaphor as the same. I am sure those who say they ""highlighted"" it or ""read it over and over"" must either have been dreaming or reading a different book. It's one long bad Writers Magazine article, one that says, Hey try using ""carmine"" instead of ""red."" Try using a metaphor instead of simply saying it was ""brown."" Duh. Keep reading the reviews, past the ones her friends wrote and you'll see the real reviews -- it just is not a good book at all."
2,"Hmmm, I'm not so sure","I usually devour writing books, sucking the marrow out of every bony paragraph. I found this book tedious, obvious and finally, after several efforts to read it, I layed it aside. Maybe I'll get back to it some day with a fresh attitude - doubt it."
1,Severely bloated,I have read other books that have a chapter covering description that are very concise. I guess I was hoping to get more of the same from Word Painting. Instead there is so much rambleing it is hard to pick out the key points. I don't have time to read random observations and at nearly 250 pages I bet you don't either. I would much rather talk a walk in the rain.
1,Here's a painted picture,"After reading a certain sentence I found the book in the trash can covered with my leftover tomato basil soup--so not even a dumpster-diving bum would be hurt by her printed words. The specific sentence was: ""Only confusing issues are interesting, just as only that which entangles us in a maze can qualify as amazing."" Ayn Rand is likely to soar out of her grave and snatch every writing tool away from her--she would have my support. One star because I couldn't rate the book lower."
2,This Sucks,"It is bloated. If there is any good information, its hidden very deep and i'm not patient enough to look for it. I want my money back."
3,50/50,"This book starts off promising and then starts to loose its steam. I was really hoping those other reviewers were wrong, but I guess not. She held my interest up until about page 75 or so, then after that I was just tired of all the stories of other people and no actual anything else. I am not going to say it is a horrible book, but I am not going to say it is as good as the other reviewers have made it out to be either. I am really upset I paid for this."
3,Word Painting: A Guide to Writing More Descriptively,"Word Painting: A Guide to Writing More DescriptivelySeems to be more of a textbook genre, meant to teach a budding author how to fill out the bare bones of the story outline. Could in fact be used as a textbook in Composition classes. I was hoping for a resource book with an easier format to quickly find hints for various subjects to be described, using outlines, or topic lists, etc. to add to my growing library for making stories come alive. I am sure it will be a valuable resource when I have time to wade through it. I am sure the author meant it to be a more in depth book than I perceived it to be."
5,Excellent!!!,My writing changed after I finished this book. This book deals with description like no other. The exercises at the end of each chapter helps immensely and makes all the difference. A must for all writers.
5,The best book ever,"My book review was on the book The mirror Merlin By: T. A. Barron this is a very good story it is filled with action drama suspense and a whole lot of characters you will never forget. The reason I like this story is because I like books based on the Middle Ages full of Dragons, Magic, and Knights my favorite being magic. I recommend this book for ages up until you can read and beyond this book I believe everybody should read this book well you've heard my opinion now its your turn to make one."
5,hooray for imagination,"More of us need a mirror so we can truly see ourselves and discover that there are positive changes we can make that will enable us to be better people and that can make the world a better place to be. This is perhaps the weakest book of the five, but is still a good read. Do start at the beginning, however, of the series, or nothing will make much sense (if anything DOES ever make sense in this mixed up world of today)."
5,Excellent.,"They just keep getting better. The Mirror of Merlin is one of the best fantasy books I have ever read; it does a great job standing up to it's legacy (you really should read them in order, though). Just read it, and you'll see."
2,Don't buy this book.,"I read all the other Lost Years books and the Merlin Effect - which is, in my opinion, the second-best book ever written - and this one was not up to T.A's standards! There is to much Hallia and not enough Merlin! Even in Wings Merlin's relationship with Hallia stops him from makin a lot of decisions! In my opinion Hallia is not an important character and impedes Merlin's abilities. Now what about Rhia? Rhia is also very important. She does barely anything at all in all but the first two books!If you must read this book, get it out of the library, do not buy it!!"
3,Someone's been reading too much T H White...,"Until I read book 4, I thought Barron had (shock horror) written something original and yet in keeping with the whole legend, in his series the Lost Years of Merlin. Not any more.The Mirror of Merlin is a good read, until Merlin the younger meets Merlin the elder. Jokes about ads for financial planners aside (anyone outside Australia know what I mean? probably not), Merlin the elder might as well just jump up and down shouting ""look at me, I've been 'borrowed' from T H White's The Sword in the Stone, except White did a much better job of it."" At least, that's the impression I got.Still, the more original parts are worth reading, and the ballymag is pretty cool."
5,Glitter Newsboy Cap,"This cap is great. It is beautiful with all the blings on it. I wear it almost everyday on my walks. I wish I had it in all colors, especially RED. It holds its shape and never stretches out. Anyone that likes hats would love this hat."
2,Not as Pictured,"This seems to work fine for some people and some devices. I was planning on using it to hook into a mobile video production studio to add my computer (has an HDMI out) for graphic overlays and such. Turns out this is not the right cord. The item pictured is a 24+1 pin DVI-D (d stands for digital) cord. The item I got was a 18+1 pin DVI-I cord. This distinction doesn't matter for all devices, however it does for my studio and the signal could not be read.Just be weary that the pictured product is not the one you get, unless they simply mixed mine up on accident. The product description was rather vague, so I should have been weary of that. If you really need a DVI-D cable, this one seems to fit the bill: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TH7T2UI returned this one immediately and ordered the other. Assuming my refund comes from the seller, will report back and on that experience."
2,Stiff Wire,This wire transmits the signal OK but is stiff and does not lay flat on the floor making it easy to trip over.
5,Quality product for such a cheap price,"Cheap, quality cable. I don't know why it is so cheap, usually these types of cables seem to run for forty plus dollars but as you can see this is sub ten dollars with shipping. Great buy."
5,Better than Amazon brand cable,"Normally I'm an amazon fanboy, but my latest experience with their HDMI cables not working properly led me to explore other alternatives. I bought this cable and it has worked absolutely perfect out of the box....no jiggling, losing picture, or having to reconnect it to maintain a connection. Just works perfect."
4,Beats the remote,Bought this to extend the PC to the TV. Worked perfectly and can enjoy Video over the large TV. Easy connect. Now I can watch video from PC to TV without moving the PC. Delivery was timely...
1,What I got was not what is pictured...,"The picture clearly shows a DVI-D dual link end, but both of the two I ordered had DVI-D single link connectors.I can understand slight cosmetic variations from product pictures (color, etc.) but the fact that the connector end is different than what is pictured is false advertising, plain and simple. Yes, single link is very similar in appearance, but I wanted dual link connectors, as is pictured.I will avoid this company like the plague from now on."
5,it works good,"has good quality and does what it needs to.(thats all i needed to write. dont worry about this. this box has an ""at least"" word limit on it)"
1,Hmmm....maybe a lemon????,I was so excited to get this cable. We got it in and hooked it up and it worked wonderful. The next day we did the same and never could get it to work again......so bummed...
1,Does not work with Sony Vaio,"The cable looks strong and well built but it does not have all the pins as shown in the picture.Second, it does not work well. The picture on the TV is so distorted that it is practically useless. I see a clearer picture with VGA cable. Literally!"
1,wrong item pictured,shoulda read all the reviews before i ordered...we also got the wrong cable...wanted 24 pins and guess it was 18 pins...so now i have to reorder from someone else i guess..in the meantime i lost some time waiting for this to work out...
3,Cable worked great,"The cable worked great. However I do not think the TV and computer technology mesh up so nicely. I had to readjust the resolution on my computer and TV to even get the picture to display. And then there is not sound. I finally bought a computer with an HDMI output. And even that I must set the TV to graphics, with full pixelization to get the screen correct.I now have one TV and no computer monitor. My TV does everything. DVR, DVD, Computer, Video phone, and anything else I have forgotten. But I could not have gotten there as efficently or cleanly just using this cable."
1,Defective - Does not work,I have several of these cords on hand at varying lengths to connect my DVI videocard to a HDMI TV port. This cord did not work. I suspect it was defective as my other cords work just fine. Sending this one back to Amazon. Definitely disappointed given all the other stellar reviews of this item.
4,Very much worth the price.,"I didn't have a dvi port on my monitor, but did have a HDMI. Problem solved."
2,Red pixels all over my screen,"My monitor is working just fine with a separate DVI cable that I have, but this cable caused it to have weird red pixels all over the screen . . . totally unusable. Will be returning it."
2,Arrived DOA,Worked but wouldn't transmit a proper signal. Tried a few things to test it. Bad cable. Upside was Amazon returned it at no cost to me. Ordered a different cable this time.AmazonBasics HDMI to DVI Adapter Cable (9.8 Feet/3.0 Meters)
2,"Great cable, bad quality","I ordered this to use with my computer and ps3 to a dvi only monitor. The cable feels like it is made of great materials, but the signal quality is terrible. No matter the resolution, my computer output would be heavily distorted. The ps3 wasn't as bad, but I still saw a significant loss of quality."
2,not satisfied,"I'm still waiting for them to correct the problem,they sent the wrong product twice.What is really sad is that they sent the same wrong one.I,ve had to pay to send it back once so far and trying to get them to send a self address envelope postaged prepaid along with the right product..thier communication back to me has inproved..I've asked them to call me on numerous times but haven't.Which I thought would be the easiest way to resolve this...will see..It not that I'am not patient..its been a month now..but still have faith..will see"
5,"Work very well, perfect for the connection of my PS3","Like the title says, perfect for my PS3 to Dell Monitor. Perfect high def resolution!"
2,works at times,i plug in and monitor doesnt recognize anything. i have to keep toggling the cable for it to work. happens everytime i turn on my monitor
2,Intermittent,"I must plug and unplug the hdmi end of the cable into my laptop to get the laptop to recognize my monitor. On my desktop machine, the cable appears not to work at all (although the 9 ft Amazon hdmi to dvi cable I bought works perfectly). The cable is stiff and appears cheap, which would be okay at this price point if it consistently worked. Also, the gold ends seemed to have a waxy film on them. I removed this film, but I still had issues with the cable."
2,HDMI Side Broke Off,"Worked well, but this cable was too short for my purpose, so when I kept swiveling my tv the HDMI side bent and eventually broke off. Felt Cheaply made."
5,Quality Cable for a Reasonable Price.,"I purchased this for $7.60 in September 2011. The PC I connect to my HDTV only has DVI outputs. My HDTV lacks any DVI ports, being equipped with only VGA and HDMI ports. Therefore, I had previously used a VGA connection between with a DVI to VGA adapter to connect my PC. The picture quality was mediocre, with a faint flicker.I purchased this cable and HD movies now look fantastic when played. The cable is well made and connects snugly to the DVI and HDMI ports on my PC and HDTV respectively. The length allows me to conceal the PC in an inconspicuous location, while maintaining perfect picture quality. Also, I would suggest buying this cable instead of an adapter, as an adapter may not always fit onto either the PC or the HDTV and may block other ports.Simply double check that your DVI output or input is compatible with the connectors on this cable. My PC's DVI output utilized DVI-I, so this cable fit the bill."
5,great cable at a great price,really good price on the cable - does exactly what I need it to! With it I was able to hook up my laptop video to my flatscreen TV - pretty sweet!
4,Good and Cheap,"I was recently given one of those huge TV's from a friend that was made just before the whole HDMI revolution. I was just looking for something basic that I could plug my laptop into and this cord definitely fit the bill.It arrived on time and was better quality than I had expected for the price. Has great flexibility, the cord feels strong, and connections are solid.Overall a great product for the price."
1,"poor picture quality, very fuzzy conection","this cord produced a very fuzzy connection , but it was very cheap so now it sits in a box"
5,Great cable - works perfectly,"I needed something to run from my computers to my HDMI inputs on my HDTV, but didn't have room behind my two computers to use a DVI to HDMI converter. This cable did the trick and the picture quality is great. It just works. I'd definitely purchase again."
2,Broke within a month,"The cable was working beautifully, great quality picture, no problems with sound, easy to connect, but after a few weeks the picture changed hue and now flickers incessantly. I checked and the problem is definitely in the cable, not any of my equipment."
2,Cable Broke,"Cable did what I wanted it to, however, after owning it for about 7-8 months, I had it hooked into my computer and shifted my computer and it pulled the hdmi connection off and I was left with little wires.Quite clearly my fault, but I would have thought that it would be built a little stronger. Truthfully, it was barely a tug that pulled it out. Tripping on it or getting it caught on something would be far worse."
2,Problem with blacks,The cable I received does not transmit the Black color properly- it is displayed with green pixels in it as if the data transmission is incorrect/incomplete. Same monitor works fine with a cable from another brand.
1,Not comfortable!,"I am disappointed in these! They LOOK pretty in the pic, but to me shoes must fit better and be comfortable. The soles, which looked similar to birkenstocks (which I like), are thinner and more flexible than I expected. My feet slide sideways on them a little, it's hard to get these to stay on. Not to mention, no one has even noticed that they have a pretty design! For me, totally not worth it."
3,There is a flow,"This collection is nice, but not stellar. I appreciate a collection because I got a hold of a few mixes I had never heard. I would advise not listening to them back to back, but mix em up with other cds. The songs get a little overkill when popping them in one after the other. If your looking for some new material, go ahead, but your not missing a great deal. Overall, only a couple meet the standards of the origional productions."
1,"sorry, have to agree, this ...","I hate to have to write a negative review, but this one ... love delirium. hated this remix. awful techno beat that was the same throughout the album. little to no variation. definitely didn't help that there were 2 cd's with the same stuff on them as well. not even good trancey driving music. save your money, buy their 'un-mixed' albums."
5,Check it Out,"The remix collection is great especially if your checking the group out or if your a fan already. Fantastic. All their releases from Sematic Spaces to Odyssey - The Remix Collection, Best of and the newest, I'll refer to it as NAGS DE' MORE, not the actual title but apropiate as dance fans and all their fans have speculated about the condition of Leebs & Fulber since Chimera. Practically everyone who as assisted with the vocals ect., is on this album. Leigh Nash, Sarah McLachlin, Kristy Thrisk, The Mediaevel Babes, On and On and On. I Misspelled Sarah's, name but you'll get it down pat with this CD, only wish older albums morpheus, stone tower, faces, forms & illusions were this good (with the vocalists I mean), the albums would still be in print and worth the money."
2,Sadly Disappointed,"As an avid Delerium fan, especially Karma and Semantic Spaces, I opened this CD with MUCH excitement. Sadly, the remixes are not near enough to the original to make it worthwhile, and are much more energetic than I had hoped. There was a time when ""Remix"" did NOT mean ""techno"". There are a few gems, however, but only the remixes of Silence I've heard before on other compilation CDs. I'll keep this, but not treasure it as much as the rest of my collection."
4,Classic techno remix of recent etheral masterpieces,"I am a huge fan of the ""new"" Delerium that touches upon a musical spirituality and depth rarely met by other groups of this genre (like Enigma). Albums like ""Poem"" and ""Semantic Spaces"" touch my soul and have me reaching out for harmony and happiness. While I have rarely been into straight-ahead, repetitive techno, this album combines the spirituality of the original music while also taking me into another space with throbbing bass beats and wandering synths. This CD actually reminds me of older BT or Robert Miles. If you are a fan of the ""new"" Delerium, if you are a fan of techno, or if you are searching for something magnificent, pick up this CD."
2,What a waste...this album could have been something,"This disc is for completists or the casual fan only. I won't waste my money on it as I already have all of the singles. I agree with the other reviewers about having THE SAME SONGS remixed on two discs. It makes no sense.I would have bought this disc anyway, but I didn't see the point. Save your money.As for the music, regrettably, some of the mixes are just jungle house versions which isn't really compatable with Delerium's music. I even like the Airscape version of Silence better."
2,Disappointing.,"Music from Delerium is typically wonderful to listen to because it is:-- imaginative-- ecclectic-- emotiveHowever, the Remix Collection possesses none of these characteristics. It is basically a ""cut-and-paste"" job of Delerium's normally lovely melodies layered with repetitive techno beats. I skipped through most of the songs in the collection and found perhaps one or two that I could really enjoy."
2,dissapointment and a rip-off,"I will be brief, I love Delerium's Karma and other titles but this double CD set contains just the remixed versions of their biggest hits, and these remixes are mostly techno or house style, whatever you call it. They do not bring much improvement or changes to the original versions. To me it is just a way to get [money] from Delerium fans so what I did is I made mp3s out of the album, just for the rare occassions I want to hear them again, and I sold the album."
2,Get Your Favorite Remixes from Singles,"There are several problems with this album. First of all, most remixes are too long and too repetative. Some tracks are simply the original voices of the performers poorly married to a boring techno beat. The second problem is the overlapping tracks: each song begins on a previous track and ends before the track ends transforming into the next song. Admittedly, some Silence remixes are very good and I wanted to make my own compillation (even edit the songs to begin and end in the right place). However, the disk seems to have some kind of protection against copying, so I could not do even that. My advise: don't buy this, but try to get all Silence remixes on other disks."
5,Good Product,"Love the product, but if you don't have an assistant to maneuver it, it can be a hassle."
1,Holders,"When I first opened the box one of the holders bottom part was broken. Which I can tape together. The holders were not tighten, which caused alot of bouncing around when shipped.For a first time user on this there is no instructions on how to connect the reflectors to the holders. The reflectors.. I can not get back into the zip case after I open them up."
1,Useless,"Mounting the reflector on this arm is unnecessarily difficult. There are far too many adjustment points for one person to elegantly manage it alone. Worse yet, when mounted on a stand, there are very few positions in which it will not tip over."
3,What Do You Expect?,"This review might be in contrast to most of the others, but I for one am satisfied with this product. I have some Westcott tripods, an umbrella, and a reflector, so I knew what to expect and I wasn't disappointed. This is not professional-grade equipment, but it does what it's suppose so. I wouldn't use a reflector arm and tripod without a sandbag to begin with, so don't punish the product for your silliness if you choose to disregard common sense.3/8/12 Update: I used this for the first time a couple weeks ago and unfortunately I must agree with some of the other reviews; I didn't have a problem with the whole stand and arm tipping over as much as the arm not being able to remain in any one position except for straight up. I am using a large 40 inch reflector, though. I'll have to do more experimenting, but I guess nothing replaces having an actual human there to hold a reflector."
4,"The holder is fine, but the photo was a little misleading","The reflector holder is good, solid construction and works well. My only complaint is that the photo shows it on a stand and doesn't mention that the stand isn't included. I have to admit that there is the usual Amazon.com advertisement that people frequently purchase a light stand and a reflector with it, but when I ordered the holder I didn't pay any attention to that because I thought I already knew what I wanted. After receiving the holder, I had to order a stand. Given the photo in the advertisement, I think they should state that the stand isn't included. The holder is useless without a stand."
3,Okay item,"I bought this arm with the stand. The arm is not secure on the stand. It doesn't sit correctly and the second time I used it, it was so wobbly that the arm started to fall, which broke off the plastic/rubber head on the stand. I am not too thrilled, but will attempt to fix it or have a camera shop work on it.Other than that, it holds the reflectors well and has great length and height options."
3,Pricey but quality is good,"Price was a little too much, but after receiving the reflector holder, I can see why. Quality is pretty good, the ball and socket holds very well.It is possible to add a justin clamp to the arm when using a reflector as a diffuser, however adding a flash to the J clamp might be a little heavy.A separate lighting stand would be required for the off camera flash."
3,Pump,"This is a lower price range pump i own a few of them because i use it for my fish tank, i have the pump running 24/7 i would replace a new pump about every two years. what i like about this pump is not too loud, hate it how i need to replace it often. For a small swimming pool it should get the job done"
3,Wrong image,"This appears to be the wrong image for the Max Flo.The Max Flo model has a black motor case and does not have the flip release to access the strainer.I don't own this pump...so, cannot comment on performance."
5,Great SOHO Copier!,"Great copier for the small office / home office. The feeder is a must for any copier and this one works great with up to 30 pages. Two paper trays allows for either different sizes of paper or just twice as much of 8-1/2 x 11 to keep you going. The default standby time is too short if making copies at various times throughout the morning, afternoon, etc. Corrected easily to the 2 hour max will ensure no waits (even if just 15 seconds) during your work day. The fact that it has network printing capability is another plus if you haven't yet a laser printer. By far this is the most copier you can get for the money without going to a comercial rental / lease."
1,Not really a printer; it's a paper jammer,"From day 1 this printer seemed to LOVE jamming & shredding paper. It almost NEVER printed more than 3 consecutive sheets without a problem. There seem to be at least two distinctly different types of jams (one actually mangles paper; the other just stops with the jam light on after printing a page), and the printer chooses between them at random. It's now sitting in my garage, awaiting the next ""heavy trash"" pickup day."
1,Beware - no Windows XP printer driver,"I bought a Sharp AL-1551 copier/laser printer well over a year ago. To date, Sharp still does provide a Windows XP driver for this unit. The Windows 98 driver provided requires manual intervention with every system start-up and the driver is very slow and bogs down my system every time I print.Several calls and emails to Sharp have either provided a canned non-response or else have pointed to conflicting ""alternate"" drivers -- none of which are satisfactory. These alternates do not work and their installation is totally non-straightforward.I think this proves that Sharp does not care about customer satisfaction and is out of their league in the printer market and it also demonstrates uncaring support for its users.This is what I get for straying away from HP for printers.Maybe others will read this and consider it before buying a Sharp printer."
3,need a replacement order,"I received the order and I opened today, but it does not working correctly,I call for technical services and after they assisted me to correct theproblem but they cannot because they said it is a defected copy machine andthey tell me to call you for you to send to me an other new copy machine and calltag this machine back please do so, and let me know. Thank you."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to getting this engine to complete my son's NameTrain. The engine we received does not appear to be first quality but rather a seconds. The wood on the front face has a slight tear out along the edge, the wood is rough on the front edge of the smoke stack, the finish on the wheels is drippy, and the magnet is glued on crooked. Not what I was expecting based on the quality of the letters and caboose I had previously purchased elsewhere."
4,For days when you need that little extra inspiration...,"Although I had already read a few of Julia Cameron's books, as well as ""Writing Down the Bones"" by Natalie Goldberg, this was a worthwhile purchase. I bought this CD set mostly because there are days (actually more often than not) when I'd rather listen to something inspiring while driving, instead of searching for something listenable the radio. This is a very absorbing discussion. My only real gripe is that all three ladies - Julia, Natalie, AND the moderator - speak in such a quiet tone that you have to sometimes rewind and turn up the volume to understand what they're saying. At times, they are talking virtually in a whisper, which I found a little distracting. But otherwise, it's a nice companion (literally) to the books, something to take with you on the road to keep you centered and on track as a writer."
1,Leave This Show to the Angels,"Charlotte Church may have a voice like an angel, but she certainly doesn't act like one. If fact, she certainly can't act at all. It probably sounded like a clever match, having the girl with ""The Voice of an Angel"" play a part on the ""Touched by an Angel"" TV show. However, Charlotte Church comes across like someone who just walked in off of the street and is reading lines from a board. I was actually more impressed by the group N'Sync than with Charlotte. This episode is O.K. but certainly not good enough to warrant buying a video of it. Roma Downey does a real good job here. Charlotte Church does sing a bit here, but not enough to make it worth purchasing this video. My recommendation is that they should leave acting to actors and singing to singers. The regular angels do fine in this series, but Charlotte Church was simply not made to act."
1,2 Different shows,"I am a big fan of Touched by an Angel. However, this episode can be divded up into two separate programs. The first starring Roma Downey was a 5-star episode. Roma's encounter trying to be a singing star along with her experience in jail, make this worth watching. The second was the part with Charlotte Church, who IMHO is the worst excuse for an actress ever to blaze her way on to the boob tube. If you can overlook this young girl's attempt at acting, you may find the entire episode to be enjoyable. I made this review 1-star because the episode is being sold by Amazon as a Charlotte Church Video. However, it may be better left as a Charlotte Church Video than a Touched by an Angel Video. Could have been a TBAA classic without CC."
5,Great Service,The book arrived very quickly and was in perfect condition. I would buy from this dealer again.
2,yawn,"I bought this CD because so many people gave rave reviews for it. I have an open mind to all kinds of music, but this stuff was just waaay too minimalistic for me. It seemed to drag on and on. I have enjoyed drone and ambient music but this is just too tedius for my tastes. I gave it to my son who is a big fan of bands like Sigur Ros and Godspeed You Black Emperor."
5,Great educational puzzle,This is a great puzzle. Bright colors and big pieces that are easy for little hands to manage. Foam pieces appear quite durable. Comes in a convenient tote that helps keep product packed and in place.
5,Perfect !!,This is exactly what I was looking for.. I don't see much options for world map puzzle. My son 5 year old has enjoyed this as well.
2,Not particularly educational!,"The quality of the material on this is poor and some of the information on the map is dated. My 5 year daughter put the puzzle together fairly quickly and has not gone back to it again.I would not buy this again, but perhaps I overestimated the what to expect. My daughter already knew the continents and I though it might help her figure out where different countries might go, but that was naive. It's just a puzzle and the puzzle is broken down randomly, preventing any real opportunity to learn.Better ways to reinforce geography and certainly better quality puzzles!"
4,Great puzzle,My son got this for his birthday and our whole family likes to put it together. My kids love that any piece will fit with any other so they don't get as frustrated. (They are 2 and 4) My husband has found a few mistakes in the geography but my kids don't know the difference and we're not using it to teach them right now anyway. I love the foam since my 10 month old is teething and he can't really hurt the pieces.
1,Did not work,This clock did not work. The seconds hand moves back and forth. I know it was cheap so I didn't expect too much but at least I did expect it to work.
1,Bad choice - camera leaks light & Canon won't fix it,"I bought a Canon Sure Shot at a local camera shop and discovered in a few months that it had a light leak, which caused all my prints to be overexposed in one corner. Canon took it back for warranty repair, held onto it for several months, then returned it. Thinking it was fixed, I didn't bother verifying the repair within one year of the original purchase. It turns out that Canon did nothing to repair it, and Canon now refuses to do the repair that it should have done in the first place because the original one year warranty has expired. I'll never buy another Canon and advise others to consider both the lack of quality and service I've experienced."
2,Jake's,A group of bird-watchers were on the beach and they came across a dolphin. They took it to the aquarium. The people took some tests on Aster and found out that she was pregnant. That was not good. Bob is born scrawny and sickly with a strange comet-shaped mark on his droopy dorsal fin. When Aster and Bob was put back into the regular pool. The other dolphins wold pick on Bob becuase he was smaller then any of the other dolphin calphs. Since Bob was treated with care he started to look like a regular dolphin calph. Bob started to do some shows and he was a star now. The dolphins started to quit doing shows and the people quit coming to watch their shows. The dolphins startewd to do shows again. The good thing is Bob turned out fine. He grew to be the normal size of a dolphin.
3,"I hate Mozart (his keyboard works, anyway)","First- this review is for both volumes of the Sonatas. Second- I have tried playing all of the Sonatas, the Fantasies and Rondos, and I found that I don't like Mozart very much. There is something that I just can't stand about his music. But the books themeselves are quite good- good paper and good printing, and the editor has done his job rather well. That's why the books get five stars, and the music only two, and that is only because of the one and only sonata which I really like- No. 12 in F major (K.332). So it comes out to 3.5 starts, and I think 3 is enough."
4,Good Introductory Book,The authors do an excellent job introducing mosaic to the beginner. They explain the different techniques and have a lot of good visual aid. The projects start simple and progressively get more complex as the beginner becomes more adept at cutting and shaping the tiles. Excellent starter book.
4,Excellent source of information for a mosaic artist.,"For the beginner, or the artist that has been out of practice for awhile, this little book comes in very handy. Good information, excellent pictures, and easy to understand. I recommend this book as a good reference book for the mosaic artist library."
5,Great starter book,Gives you everything you need to know/purchase to start your first mosaic projects. Instructions are clear and photographs make understanding the necessary tools and techniques very helpful.
5,Clever and Unique,"This DVD was everything I expected. The story is well done, the artwork is amazing. It has a very unique style. I didn't think it was scary, but you should know the rating on the DVD suggests 16 and up for adult themes and violence. I was happy to learn that it gives the option of watching it in Japanese and with English subs. The English dubs aren't bad and no offense to Andrew Francis, but I think Takahiro Sakurai did a better job as the voice of the Medicine Seller. I'm a big fan."
5,more accessible than expected,"Six Walks is more accessible than I had expected (my copy is now heavily highlighted, marked up, and loaded with the little plastic stickies I use to flag ideas and references). Eco is speaking to readers and, thereby, equally to writers. The six Charles Elliot Norton lectures begin with the role time plays in fiction and end with the importance (to our perception of reality) of accuracy in writing fiction. This is weighty stuff made accessible by Eco's illustration by example: Yes, Dante, Shakespeare, and Kafka, but the writers who give us Hercule Poirot, Agent 007 and Little Red Riding Hood as well. If you read fiction or write fiction, the material will be useful and the book will please."
4,Eco and Calvino,Eco writes this book in response to Italo Calvino's thoughts on the same topic. His wit and wisdom inspire the authorial soul within me.
4,How does he do it?,"Author Deane Jordan has come up with yet another series of mistaken beliefs and distorted history. Some of these are rib busting funny, and some amusing cocktail fare, but it's nice to know someone is checking up on common knowledge."
4,"pretty good, and very amusing","This is a good book for when your friend cant play and your done with homework. You can re-read it as many times as you want and it's still funny. A good amuser, though it could be better."
2,Excellent!,"This is one of the best books I've read on the subject. Everyone who is involved in any type of business research or competitor research can benefit from this book. It even includes detailed descriptions of some of the best business information resources available, on- and offline."
4,Great overview on the subject!,"Whether your in the business, have a background in intelligence, or new to the subject, this book provides a pretty good overview on the subject and is a good bridge between ""intelligence"" (of the secret type) and ""competitive intelligence"" (of the business world type). This book would not be suitable for an indepth, ""how-to"" on competitive intelligence. If you really know basics or have extensive knowledge in competive intelligence (and you don't need a good list of references on the subject), than I wouldn't purchase this book. If you have a good background in intelligence and want to be introduced to competitive intelligence and plan to read more, than this is definitely worth $20 bucks."
5,Recommended reading for business managers.,The basics of understanding competitive intelligence in the digital age are revealed in a guide which covers the key issues in competitive intelligence; from accounting models and the technology marketplace to resources for intelligence. Millennium Intelligence provides a basic overview of business intelligence and its management for business managers.
5,A summary,Dean's book pulls together all I'v previously read and experienced into a readable easily understood and flowing formatt.
5,"An essential, but not characteristic, femmes album","This album may be a bit over produced, and may not have the stripped down, organic sound of the violent femmes' other releases, but IT IS A FANTASTIC ALBUM. I've been a huge VF fan for over 10 years and this album more than any other finds it's way to my stereo again and again. The variety of mood and style, country, punk, funk, blues, pop, and even new age, make it a refreshing addition to the femmes collection. So what if they're playing electric instruments, so what if the drummer is playing a full kit, it's still one great, interesting song after another. It may not be the first violent femmes album you should buy, but it is, nonetheless, essential."
2,Disappointing,"The Violent Femmes first album was a startling masterpiece. Gordon Gano seemed to let everything go, giving it an emotional vulnerability that is missing in many pop albums. After HALLOWED GROUND, the Femmes released this, an overproduced collection. Certainly, ""I Held Her In My Arms"" and the cover of ""Children Of the Revolution"" are great, but many of the other songs are silly and almost self-parodic. For some this will be almost like a parody attempt, but it's not funny. The rest of us who see it as serious will instead laugh at its stupidity and laugh at it for that reason. As for the production thing again, try to stick with your minimalist approach. It works better."
4,blind leading the naked,"this is another classic outing for the femmes,tense ,agitated,pulsing,moody,with a hint of underlying insanity."
2,bland leading the naked,"A little better than ""3"" but not by much. The music has a fuller sound and more instrumentation is used in a kind of country-blues format. However, non of these things rescue the album from the weak songwriting and again songs meander to the point of becoming obselete. Gano's vocals like ""3"" are annoying and whining.I've only heard this and ""3"" - maybe there are better albums, but i won't have either in my CD player anytime soon."
4,A great book for fans and movie buffs alike!,"With a direct facsimile of the original draft scripts, this book is great fun for the fans, who will enjoy squinting to decipher the hastily-penciled revisions, and for anyone interested in the evolution of a script. With some appropriate tributes, and a few pretty photographs, there could be a little more depth, but the ride is so much fun that it would feel wrong to be overly critical of this."
4,Freddy rules,"I liked this glove,yet it is a little flimsy. The blades bend easily and the material for the glove is cheap yet, really didn't spend too much on it, therefore I'm content."
2,Poor print quality,"Print quality is only fair - blurred text. Forget any kind of small chart or image.Ribbon is not in a cartridge, making it hard to load.There is no tray to catch pages.Main advantage is a small footprint."
3,Works okay for the money,I've had this fax machine for approx. a year and have only used 1 ink cartridge (which I don't think is too bad considering how much I use it). This is a half way decent fax machine for the money. I wouldn't get this machine if you plan on copying very detailed info but if you are copying regular typeface on regular sheets of paper it's okay. If you try copying something heavier than regular paper or lighter than regular paper it will most certainly get stuck (at least for me it did!). But for basic faxing and copying this fax works fine. I also have digital telephone and answering machine and call id and it worked fine for me.
3,No phone/fax switch,I didn't even set up the unit because I need the phone/fax switch. I wish this information as well as whether the fax is call waiting compatable was available before I took it home. I will return it.
3,I NEED HELP?,"Hey I can't seem to find the song that plays when Slim is walking down the street an the cop is following her, and she tricks him. If anyone could help me out an tell me the name of the song and who sings it, I would really appreciate it!"
5,Help me find this song!,"Hey, I was wondering wat that song was when J-Lo is sitting on the step outside and her daughter says ""Don't cry mommy"", the song plays right after she sees her dad, and he gives her 6 dollars for a burger. Email me if you know the song! love yas!"
3,Found The Song With JLo Sittling On The Stairs,"For All you looking for the song with JLo sitting on the stairs after she meets her dad... the one with ""Better pack your bags and run"" it isToday's The Dayby Aimee Mann"
1,PLEASE HELP ME FIND THIS SONG!!!!,"Ok, i love this song but its wasnt on the soundtrack! It was where J.Lo was sitting on the stairs crying and her gracie said ""dont cry mommy"" and then the song came on. It went something like ""You better Pack your bags and run"" Please email me if you know where i can find that song! thank you"
3,i cant find this song,"ok so theres this song and it goes something like ""gotta be that girl....in this world...."" and i cant find it anywhere...does anyone know what it is??????????"
2,"it should be Aimee Mann's ""Today's the Day""","the song's name is not Enough, but ""Today's the Day"", featured in Aimee Mann's latest album Lost In Space :)"
2,"Aimee Mann song in the movie ""Enough""","The song my Aimee Mann is ""Today's the day"" and is on her cd Lost in Space. Hope this helps anyone"
3,"Decent Movie, Good Featured Artist Musician","The movie is good but lacks some believability towards the end of the story. Aimee Mann's ""Today is the Day"" was a good choice of musical accompaniment. Too bad it didn't show up on the actual soundtrack."
4,please help me!!,"I have been driving myself crazy trying to think of who sings a song and what it is called in the movie ""Enough"". It sounds kind of like Jewel. I'm not sure though. If anyone knows please tell me. Thanks alot!"
3,Reply to Artemio Madrigal,I read your review and I hope you come back to this page because the song you were looking for Enough is by Amiee Mann. Even without this song the soundtrack is worth checking out.
5,Great Pocket Knife,"This is a very sharp and well made pocket knife. The odd shape of the blade actually make it easier to open packages, and cut through anything. The blade is strong and sharp so be careful..."
3,Not my favorite Spyderco,"This was an impulse buy and if I could do it over again, I wouldn't purchase it.The good:Looks niceSmallLightweightBrushed steel resists fingerprintsThe bad:Blade came duller than other spyderco'sLoses edge VERY fastI have other VG-10 knives that have held up to a lot more than this blade.Blade design may not be ideal for your cutting needs.I was looking for a lightweight, 'gentleman's knife' to carry in slacks or jeans. I keep trying to fall in love with this knife, but I end up going back to my SOG Access Card 2.0"
4,a good small office copier,"This is a good copier for a small office/workgroup, probably in the 4-10 person range. Reasonably fast, good quality copies, a good range of presets. It does transparencies, heavy weight stock, and also labels (though feeding one sheet at a time works best for these). It takes a little while to warm up after the autosleep mode, but that's common with small copiers. The feed tray works well for relatively short documents (20 pages or so). The feeder is supposed to take 30 pages, but that's really pushing it."
4,"Great pump, but oh so loud!","Bought this pump to replace a Mr.Gasket pump that started leaking after very little use. I chose the Holley pump because it's rebuildable. The pump works fine, but it's the noisiest pump I've ever heard. OK for racing applications, but pretty loud for street use. I can hear it over the exhaust which is pretty throaty. I'm planning to build a housing to hopefully trap the noise."
3,PR sucks...,"You know... Ive always heard that the PR was a good prep book, so I went out and bought this book. The drills are ok...but its not that good. There are 3 practice tests in this book, but there are no explanations. It just tells you the answers and moves on to another test. I first thought that I got a ""defected"" book...but no...all my friends told me that their books were also answer-explanation-less. Dont buy this book...get yourself a Barrons."
1,So few examples,Do not waste your money on this title. There are so few examples and they don't resemble the actual SAT questions at all.
1,B-movie of worst kind,"B-movie ""comedy"" that's the opposite of funny. It was painful to just sit through the screening. I can't believe these kinds of movies even get made.Please save your money or give it to charity."
1,Don't Trust Rebates from this Company,Jumped through all kind of hoops for a $10 rebate and they still found a way to not honor it. I will never by another product from them. Have not had problems with anyother cdr company.
3,It's okay.,I use to copy my paster's sermon. It's good for that but on the front has some line... it's not match for us...Thanks.
1,Terrible quality,Save your money because these CD's are garbage. I copied the same CD 10 times. Out of those 10 CD's - 6 of them failed. In addition to that the spindle they came in was cracked. Maxell use to be a quality company...I guess this is what happens when you outsource. Very disappointing.
3,Have a high burnout rate,"Maxwell Model 648200 CD-R do not burn well on audio with my computer burner. Also, last shipment was totally damaged. Not exactly thrilled with this product. Expected more quality from Maxwell."
4,These are Compact Discs,These are Compact Discs. I use them to burn music. They work.I have no opinion on the cost. The shipping was within the specified dates.
1,Not for CD reccorders,"Maxell make great products and have for a long time. I still have 2 of the 3 cassettes I bought in the late 70s and they still sound pretty good. BUT, my loving sister bought me these to record her lps and they don't work in Sony CD recorders. They are data CDs not music CDs."
5,Great,"I used these cd's to record my old cassettes tapes on, they work great...since my tapes are old and the quality of the cd did a good job."
3,Maxell CD-R CDs for copying,"This product is not as good as Sony but did perform with few flaws. Amazon, as always, came through on time with their service."
1,Too many duds,"I had to do a large burn of over 100 disks for work. PowerPoint and Publications.In this 100 disk pack that came today, only 24 disks out of the 100 were burnable; the other 76 were not.I used 3 burners for my project...no one burner had a disproportional rejected burns. One burner was on a different computer. Two were on the same computer.When a disk was rejected, I tried it on another drive....never did another drive accept a rejected disk.I have always used Maxell; years ago for cassettes, then VHS and now disks. I have NEVER had this trouble before and I do a lot of burning.Hopefully this is not a trend for Maxell. But I can't afford the time or the money to find out.Very frustrating."
1,really poor quality,"i used to work at a digital video company several years back and i never had a problem with this brand. however, they must have been bought out by memorex or perhaps they are just using cheaper ink because all i have had were dud cds. i've actually never had so many unusable cd-r's in one pack. over 70% of the 100 pack were bad. sticking to taiyo yudens from here on out."
3,"good, but a rehash of his other books","This is a good and useful book, but Jones says exactly the same thing in all his books. I recommend his Applied Software Measurement book instead."
4,Good or Not? THAT is the question....,"I think it is one of the BEST albums of Saber Marionette, it has really cool song that makes you sing along. I have the CD, and I don't get tired of hearing it over and over because it's really cool and has the coolest songs from the series and OVAS. This is a MUST BUY for Saber Marionette fans!"
3,its okay,"if I'd looked at this book in a book store I probably would not have purchased it. photos and text seem quite site specific, but I'll glean some ideas from the book"
2,Very Disappointing,This video is not at all what it appears to be. If you want to know all about Diana and Charles' marriage and divorce then this is the video for you. The video is nothing but old footage. The only tape of anyone after Diana's death is during the funeral. The only discussion about the boys is about how they might have dealt with their mother's death and their parents marriage. Highly disappointing.
2,Disappointing Video,This video was very disappointing. The cover leads you to believe that footage from the Klosters 2000 ski trip is on the video. Which made me believe that footage from all of the Princes outings in 2000 would be included. Their is no new footage from 2000 included. It is a recap of info that was previously put out on video of a similar title. Only thing that changed was the cover.
2,Don't waste your money on this one...go for more serious books!,"I bought this book (used copy) on the net as part of my desk research into 'developing test/exam mastery', without realising that it is actually a cigarette-box size booklet. I was attracted by the sub-title 'how to pass exams the easy way'. It's written in a tongue-in-cheek way & I read it in less than 3 minutes. The treatment is very superficial. My advice to readers is DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this one. Please go for more serious books, like any one of the following:- How to Pass Your Exams Every Time, by Mike Evans;- Passing Exams without Anxiety, by David Acres;- How to Pass Exams, by Dominic O'Brien;- Passing Exams, by Dawn Hamilton"

3,surprise,Although not mentioned anywhere on the cd you are getting a LIVE recording. Sometimes I like the live versions but I like to know it first. Lou still has his smooth voice and he sounds great but I really wanted the original studio versions of these classics.
2,Defective/Refurbished,Received promptly. Liked size and appearance. After trying three new batteries clock ran and then got stuck. Had to return defective clock. Also was very surprised to see a sticker on back that said refurbished. Really disappointed that nowhere did I read that I was paying full price for a refurbished product.
1,This barrette is too big,"This barrette is awesome, however, it'is too big to the people with few hair, it gradually drops from hair. It is the reason why I returned it."
3,Adult wrists only,"Bought these for my 9 year old daughter and they are too big around to fit on her wrist. She wanted to use them under gymnastics grips. Oh well, we'll wait for her to grow in to them. They look fine otherwise - solidly constructed. But I'm giving them a 3 for not specifying that the ""small"" was still quite large."
1,I lernt to red and rite with hole langwage.,"hole langwage reelly heped me to lern to red and rite, i am reelly hapee,peeple whu say that hole langwage is garbij are rong, just luk what hole langwage dun for mee."
1,Worth the money?,"Any high school student knows that an adapter is nothing more than... well, an adapter. As long as the voltage and current matches your device, any brand should be ok.Don't understand why it is rated 4 stars. Should value be considered when we rate products?"
3,Olympus D-40Z (& other 2 battery cameras) Beware!,"This is not the adapter you want if you own the D-40Z or other 2 battery camera!!! Somewhere in the search process, this adapter is recommeded for the Olympus D-40Zoom camera (a 2 battery camera). Instead, you want the ""Olympus E-7AU"" AC Adapter which is a 3-volt adapter to match the camera (not this C-7AU which is 6v)."
3,"Without Context, Not All It's Cracked Up To Be","Sorry to dissent, but there are two things that sink this album for me. First, the synths on are pretty amateur (Bernard Hook himself said, ""We pretty much learned our instruments on Blue Monday""). Second, the lyrics get unignorably bad (""You've caught me at a bad time, so why don't you p*** off"" as an example.) That said, you listen to New Order for the beats and melodies, and at least Age of Consent and Ultraviolence deliver the goods. Later albums and singles are much better I think. They don't quite know their direction here."
2,They moved on and left me behind,"With this album New Order started to do their own thing, well distinct from the sound of Joy Division which was still prominently featured in the previous album ""Movement"".On the plus side they honestly decided not to capitalize on whatever success JD had enjoyed, and moved on. On the minus side - dammit - I had happened to like Joy Division and New Order's new sound was not only completely different, but considerably more commercial (according to me, at least).In retrospect it might not have been a complete sell out, but I judged it as such at the time: this album sounds much more mainstream that anything they had done before. Good for them, but they lost me in the way.About the only song I like out of this album is ""Leave me alone"", needless to say it's the one more reminiscent of their past."
3,Ehhhhhhh...,"I will admit that, at the time of writing this review, Power Corruption, & lies is the only New Order or Joy Division record I own. I admit to being ignorant of the history of this band.However, my knowledge of the band does not change the fact that this record is, in a way, too consistent. The melodies almost repeat themsleves verbatim track after track, and the songs get boring fast because the songs rely heavily on them. There are a few standouts, like The Village, Leave Me Alone, and Blue Monday (CD version), but they are only temporary periods of excitement in an otherwise stagnant record. The lyrics are pretty good, that is the strong point of this album.I gave this album three stars so that I can give in another chance."
4,Great music - but some reviews are not about THIS cd set,"Look at the dates on the reviews. I think only one review so far is about the remastered cd set - and it flags several problems with the remastering. There is no word on sound quality (otherwise) of the remastered disc (sometimes ""remasters"" sound about the same as the older cheaper discs).Reader beware....."
5,One those truly great recordings,"This is an amazing record. I first heard it when it was released in 1983, and still remember being astonished. The original vinyl released by Factory Records had no name on it, and little if any recording info. The tracks were arranged differently (frankly, the original arrangement, with ""Your Silent Face"" being the title track, and ""Leave Me Alone"" the ending one was better), but this record still shows this band at its peak. Later New Order is nothing more that a pop dance band, while the Joy Division (its predecessor) was often too dark and incomprehensible to appreciate. This record shows them at the point where they were making the transition to a dance band, but it still retains a real edge to it. A true classic that is very listenable."
2,Cheers to New Order; Jeers to Amazon,"This is an outstanding record, and this reissue in particular is an excellent remastering/packaging of the original pressing.My complaints are not about the product, but about Amazon's listing of it. At least two details are incorrect: (1) It does NOT include ""a coupon for MP3 download of the album"" as outlined in Amazon's editorial review, and (2) it does NOT include the tracks ""Blue Monday"" nor ""The Beach"" as outlined on Amazon's track listing (as it's a reissue of the original pressing, not the later American CD/cassette releases which included them).These are both very important distinctions to someone considering purchase, and though it might not be intentional, from the perspective of a customer it appears as a bait-and-switch type of deception that Amazon suggest their inclusion. These kinds of lazy research errors seem all too common with Amazon listings, and are nothing short of criminal.Get it together Amazon."
4,the actual Movement of NewOrder,"Power, Corruption, and Lies to me is the actual album that seperates NewOrder from Joy Division. During the album Movement it seems the band still wasn't sure what route they wanted to go with their music. This album is where they ""defined"" a sound, and a new band. An album that was inspired by Kraftwerk, and the need for something new. From Blue Monday, to Your Silent Face, PCL merged electronic music with some of the deepest heart-felt lyrics. An album that definately stands the test of time."
4,London release 8573 81366-2,"Note that this 2000 UK release by London records(CentreDate Co Ltd.) is missing the Blue Monday single tracks, making it faithful to the original 8 tracks Factory release.Sound quality is very good, with somewhat boosted bass and treble from the original CD release, and the dynamics do not appear to be a victim of the loudness wars. ""Your Smiling Face"" sounds particularly lush. Despite the missing Blue Monday single, this CD is still highly recommended for newcomers to the ground-breaking band from Manchester. Play back to back with Movement and Substance!"
5,Far and away their best effort,"Unfortunately, New Order peaked at the beginning of their career. Forever haunted by the superior Joy Division releases, they still managed to produce some great records (and most importantly some great 12"") early on. ""Power, Corruption & Lies"" is easily their best and most consistent effort, with tracks like ""Age of Consent"", ""Your Silent Face"" and (my personal favourite) ""Leave Me Alone"" standing out on an album most noted for its coherency. The production is great and especially Peter Hook's bass work is outstanding.If at all possible, get your hands on a release that *doesn't* contain ""Blue Monday"" and ""The Beach"". Good tracks in and of themselves, they really break up this album. There is a reason that they were left out in the first place, and it's sad to see that those reasons are disrespected. The album is far superior without them.20 years later and still New Order are releasing decent music, but they never again sounded as good as on ""P, C & L""."
4,Classic New Order,"When I say classic I mean this is a classic New Order album that isn't a greatest hits collection (which is pretty much all New Order has been putting out for the last 5 years). I love pretty much all of these songs. They have the classic New Order blend of guitars and cynth sounds. The previews offered by Amazon here give you a good taste of whatthe songs are like, if you're into them then give the album a try."
2,Customer Service Skills Lacking,"I placed an order for 4 separate Kringle's to go to 4 separate addresses. One of the orders was never sent by the company. They basically ruined somebody's Christmas gift. A couple days after Christmas, all I got was an apology and they said they would refund the one Kringle purchase. You'd think they'd do something to make up for their mistake, especially considering how many orders I placed. Enjoy the money you got from this years Kringle purchase, because it will be the last time I'll ever place an order there. There are other bakeries that do mail order. You apparently want my money more than you want my business."
2,Luguna clear fast,"I've written a review before on this product and I'm upset with it. It will work for one time and then cloud up again. I did call the company and talk to a rep.- which basically told me I didn't have their products in the pond - thats why it did not work properly - well after I told her what products we had purchased she backed off and play the blame game on something else.Well I'm going to totally clean my ponds this year and start over again - by the way your local Southern States has some very good pond clearfiers, etc at great prices."
5,Works fast,"I have a 750 gallon pond which I am proud to say I setup myself. I was disappointed when my water turned green from the sun. As I had no experience with this before I went searching for something to get rid of the green water. Came to Amazon and I found this, Laguna Clear Fast which really does clear fast. It contains no harmful chemicals to hurt any of the animals that drink from the waterfall nor the birds that at times bathe also where the waterfall is. Green water one day, crystal clear the next. Easy to use and it works. Won't buy any other product except this one."
1,Does not perform as stated,"I bought this product based upon the reviews on this site. I can tell you, after having purchased it and followed the instructions regarding dosage, aeration, filtration, and cleaning that to date, the product does not work at all. My pond is still green as can be. This product appears to be nothing more than water with blue food coloring in it. Prior reviews must have been written by company spokespeople, because this product does not work as stated. I cannot tell any difference at all in the water purity. Please don't waste your money like I did."
2,Clearly not so clear,I had much higher expectations of this produce.It says CLEAR FAST POND WATER CLARIFIER but so far it has done nothing. Our pond water continues to have a greenish color. The algae is under control so it shouldn't be the algae.I have been using this product now for two weeks and still no clear water.Not what I had hoped for.
5,Enchanting!,"This is an enchanting tale about Nibble the squirrel, his parents and Mr. M.O. Squirrel (the meanest squirrel you ever met!) I had this book as a child and now have it in my own child's library. Even as an adult I enjoy reading it. Highly recommend for any childs book collection!"
2,Where are the songs everyone is looking for?,Who cares about the songs on this cd? What 90% of us really want are the contemporary songs peppered througout the film that really made the film so flavorful. This is a weak & overwhelmingly disappointing offering.
3,Answer to question about song,"The song at the beginning of the movie is Butterfly by Crazytown, I believe."
2,CD's a rip-off!!!,30 songs in the movie; 14 songs on the soundtrack CD!!! Less than 1/2 the songs in the movie are on the CD!!![...]
4,Soundtrack for Something's Gotta Givge,"Great CD, I loved the movie and really like the soundtrack. I would recommend purchasing it if you liked the movie or even if you haven't seen the movie."
3,Words and Music,"I'm also looking for that haunting music that plays whenever Jack and Diane are together. It also plays at the very end of the movie as the final credits roll. Can anyone tell us the name of the song and the artist? It's an instrumental.The movie is great -- at once touching, funny, and insightful. No, it's not real. The events are unlikely, but if we could instinctively see truth, there would be no need for art. Nancy Meyers is brilliant."
3,"HELP - Looking for a song, too...","The movie was pretty good and so is the soundtrack--for the most part. I agree with the people who have posted reviews before me... the soundtrack is missing that great song from the Diane Keaton/Keanu Reeves scene in her kitchen. I am also searching for the song, like others. Does anyone know what the name of that song is and who sings it? It isn't ""Sunday Morning"" by Maroon 5 as a previous poster suggested. I am sure that it wasn't Jamiroquai, as I did not see it listed in the song credits after the film, but it sounded a lot like him. It was a jazz song, with a great guitar. If anyone can figure it out......please post!"
3,the song,The song is Sunday Morning but the song on Love Actually is Sweetest Goodbye. Both are by Maroon 5.
4,"4 stars (would have been 5 if not for Jack's rendition of ""La Vie en Rose"")","One of the most hysterical parts of this film for me was when Diane Keaton's character breaks into alternating fits of anguished sobbing/crazed laughter as she writes her way through the pain of being dumped by Jack Nicholson. As she writes, she listens to French music. When I was hunting around recently for some great French song classics, I decided this soundtrack would be perfect. The only fly in the potage was Jack Nicholson actually attempting to sing ""La Vie en Rose"" - he is pretty much tone-deaf, despite his attempts to sound like Maurice Chevalier, and I always skip past it... his performance in the movie was priceless and he should have quit while he was ahead and not tried to be a chanteur."
3,Opening Song,"I noticed that a lot of people were wanting to know what the name of the opening rap song was. It's ""Butterfly"" by Crazy Town. It's a great song (one of my faves)and I hope this helps!The movie was good and I thought that it had a great soundtrack, but I'm disappointed that they left that song off of the soudtrack."
4,"It IS ""Sunday Morning""--I'm so glad...","I loved the soundtrack (the French songs were GREAT), however Maroon 5's ""Sunday Morning"" (the song playing when Keanu Reeves is eating @ the dinner table with Diane Keaton (Erica) and her sister) and Paul Simon's ""Learn How To Fall"" songs were not included--the songs included on there, however, were great! I will be buying the soundtrack to ""Love Actually""--does anybody know if the entire song ""Sunday Morning"" is on there? It looks as though it's a medley or a mix...just wondering!"
4,Delightful,"Just saw the movie recently and loved it. Picked up the CD on a whim as I was checking out of a music store. This will indeed end up being one of my all time favorites ! The selection of the different tracks is simply perfect and the quality of each is outstanding ! Have listened to it over and over since purchasing it (less than 24 hours ago) and want to hear it again and again! It leaves you feeling just plain good !! The varioius French selections are different and intoxicating, and Jack Nicholson's version of ""La Vie en Rose"" on the last track is the best !"
2,Missing in action,"So disappointed, wanted to purchase it, but didn't since many of the best songs are missing..."
1,THAT SONG,"Sara j. Hahn, you are looking for 'Crazy Town' the song is called ' Butterfly (Come My Lady). I believe this song makes the film... Why it wasn't included on the soundtrack I don't know.The movie is fantastic."
1,Why Buy?,The cut that wrapped the whole movie and echoed the theme of the story is missing - so what's the point?
4,best acting,"This movie has the best acting, I have seen in years. Actors are amazing. This movie is not suitable for children, adults only (18+)."
4,Maroon 5,"The song that played during the dining scene with Keanu Reeves, Francis McDormand and Diane Keaton is called ""Sunday Morning"" by Maroon 5. This song is also on the new movie ""Love Actually"" soundtrack.Excellent movie and soundtrack, by the way."
3,Name of the Opening Rap Song,"Hey! I think i know the name of the song and artist. I've seen 4 different movies this week so I hope I didn't confuse this with another one but here goes:""Here we go"" by Grits. It's a christian rap group i think but they are really good. Good luck and hope I helped."
2,Something's Gotta Give,I was quite dissapointed that I purchased this CD to capture the track that everyone else was referring to. I also believe it was the kitchen scene. I haven't had a chance to check out the Maroon 5 possibility because someone indicated this was not the song. Has anyone else come up with an alternative artist or name of track? The credits went so fast that it was hard to figure out what tracks would match what I heard.
2,You left out some of the best songs!,"Unfortunately, I was looking forward to purchasing the ""Something's Gotta Give"" soundtrack until I looked at the track listings and saw that you left out two very important songs: ""Butterfly"" by Crazytown and Maroon 5. The cd would have been so much better with these two songs on it!"
2,Disappointed in quality,"As much as I loved the movie, I was very disappointed in the CD. I thought this was suppose to be a soundtrack. It is not!The French songs in the movie were lovely, this version is not what I expected."
4,Marvin Gaye,"Gopal, maybe it's Marvin Gaye's song ""Let's Get it On"". Unbelievable it isn't in the cd soundtrack."
3,Sunday Morning,"This song is on the Love Actually soundtrack. If you haven't seen the movie yet - go now before it leaves theaters! This soundtrack is incredible and makes me want to see the movie everytime I listen to it.I was going to buy this soundtrack, but am a little disappointed with the included selections. I know a couple of movies that have put out more than once soundtrack - maybe we'll get lucky! Then I'd buy both to remind me of the entire movie."
3,Love the Music,"I simply love the selection of songs on this cd. Unfortunately for me, the quality of the cd does not perform well in my car. The cd player in my car does not operate well when I try to listen to burned cd's and this is exactly what I experienced. I have no problem with manufactured cd's, but I do with this one."
3,Paul Simon Song,"I loved this movie but all the good ""English"" songs are missing from the soundtrack. I was a bit dissappointed about that. The soundtrack definately creates a very mellow mood. I guess that can be seen as a positive. By the way the Paul Simon song at the end is called ""Learn How to Fall"" its on the ""There Goes a Rhymin Simon"" album. Hope this helps."
2,missing songs,I too am a little dissapointed that some of the great modern songs are missing. I am curious as to the name of the song played that is like a Jamiroquai tune.
3,Missing my favorite song,"I think the jamiroqai song that everyone is trying to figure out is by maroon 5. The name of the song is ""Sunday Morning""."
3,FUN WAY TO REMEMBER THE MOVIE (but only the movie),A bit odd because the recording quality wasn't up to snuff. We enjoyed some of the songs because they brought back the memory of the movie; but overall wouldn't recommend anyone buy this CD.
2,Up beat French song??????,"I have heard the up beat french song before in a Henry Jaglom movie.....""Festival in Cannes"" but can not find reference to it on the sound track. A man sings ""boom boom boom."" rather like a heart beat.......anyone know who the singer is? I think it plays when Jack is walking in Paris.....but not sure."
3,Question about the movie soundtrack,What is the song towards the end of the movie when Jack Nicholson &his New family are entering the restaurant?
3,somethings gotta give soundtrack,"to s2klstc, I think you and I are both searching for the same song. I actually just saw the movie yesterday and was not able to figure it out as the credits scrolled rather quickly. If you've found it since you saw it in Dec would you mind sharing?Thanks!"
3,The Song at the Beginning,"The song at the beginning of the film is by Crazytown. I believe the song is ""Butterfly."" It was very popular a few years ago. I am very fond of the french tracks on the soundtrack. The movie is absolutely dreadful, but the soundtrack is right on."
4,Snoop is not wack on this album!,"Why is every one tripping on this album? It would be stupid to try and copy Doggystyle so much.He just beat his murder case, 2pac died, his label was all over the place and he still manages to put a wicked album together. Dont hate on the Doggfather for not cussing so much either, hes growing up and putting more meaning in his lyrics."
4,I know the real reason why...,"The real reason why people don't like this album much has to be because Snoop is very...well quiet on the mic...On many of the songs the beat swallows him up...I don't know if this is a mixing failure or what, but it never happened with Dre in the studio, right? It doesn't occur on the Chronic 2001 either...I can't speak on the Last Meal cd...But I thought that almost all the beats were supertight, DJ Pooh is an excellent producer and Daz is even better maybe (if he wasn't then, he is now). This is a tight album overall, Snoop obviously isnt as raw on this one but his flow is superb as always."
5,Tight and smooth pimpin' hip hop.,"Not as killa as the OG Snoop album but it's Supafly tight. Check Vapors, Whole Crowd Bounce, and Snoop's Upside Ya Head. It's got the fat beats, the smooth slices, razor sharp lyrics and you know Snoop bring the REALNESS! If you down with the OG album, this is for you; just give it 2 or 3 plays...""All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce ya'll."""
4,Snoop takes it laidback,Doggystyle was phatter.The Doggfather is more laidback and smooth.Doggystle is more of a party style cd.
5,Tha Doggfather Cassette (1996),"This is the first tape I ever owned. I loved it then, and it still doesn't get old. The songs from Snoop sound like a hybrid of his old school west coast gangsta style and his current futuristic funky sound. A+"
3,Not Bad...,"lots of people compare this album to doggystyle, which is unfair. Doggystyle will never be beat. I think this is his third best album (doggystyle & tha last meal are better). there are some really good songs on dis album like:-Vapors-snoops upside ya head-snoop bounceThis album is definatley worth having. wateva u do, dont buy ""paid the cost to be the boss"" or ""the game is to be sold not told"" becuz they r snoops worst."
3,"OK, but not his best","This album is ok, though it is better than Da Game and No Limit Top Dogg, it doesnt touch Doggystyle and is not as good as Tha Last Meal either. Tha songs, groupie and Snoops upside your head r pretty good, but most of the rest are boring. Although groupie does sound alot like Aint no fun off Doggystyle. If u r a big Snoop fan then get this album, but not b4 uve got Doggystyle or Tha Last Meal."
3,Snoooooop Doooogggg...,Snoop Dogg was good Doggystyle times..Something had happend..What? Stop smoking? No. Maybe too much age. But if wants to hear Snoop Dogg nowadays its sounds like that.Buy if you are big Snoop fan.I dont.
4,Worth it,"All I can say is, this is a good CD if you like a good base line and lyrics worth licening to."
5,Snoop is back,This album is the successful follow up to Doggystyle and though not as good as its predecessor in its own right it is a great hip hop album.
1,This is nothing compared to Doggystyle,This CD is sorry as hell. The best song are Snoop's upside ya head and Blueberry.
4,Beat heads stay away............,If your strictly a beathead you won't like doggfather or be able appreciated its smooth laid back flow. Its almost as if snoop's about to fall asleep at times but don't be fooled by the effortless sound.Though this album betrays how good it is put it in the cd changer with Doggystyle and get to appreciate it for what it is....Tha Doggfather no more no less.
3,The magic is gone.....................,"The phenom Snoop that killed verses on The Chronic, Doggystyle and Dogg Food is no where to be found on here. The whole vibe is gone. Without Dre by his side, Snoop was half a MC. It would be years before Snoop showed any resemblance to his old self."
1,"Tha Doggfather,Weakest of all albums.along w/no limit.","Weakest of all his works including no limit, maybe 2 or 3 good songs. this was when Snoop sold out Pac'. Never respected him since then. Sell out."
3,"His 3rd best album, out of 4.","This album is no where near as good as Doggystyle, but is better than ""The Game is to Be Sold..."" It's not as wack as many people make out, but there only a handful of stand-out tracks. No Limit Top Dogg is definately his best work since Doggystyle, but this is still worth checking out if you are a big Snoop fan."
5,No need for Dr. Dre,"The highly-anticipated Snoop Doggy Dogg album Tha Doggfather is pretty close to being flawless by rap standards. With more tracks than Doggystyle and with DJ Pooh, I'm sure Snoop Dogg felt he needed to make a good enough album if he wanted it to be dedicated to the late Tupac Shakur."
4,Good picture and idea book,"This is a beautiful book. The pictures are stunning and the dishes are inspiring. That said, most of the recipes are terribly complicated for the home cook. Many of the fish are hard to get and regional; most of the preparations often require things that only a restaurant kitchen can feasibly do (i.e. tomato water).Still, some of the dishes are approachable by the home cook and the if you are inventive, many could inspire you to come up with your own creations.An added bonus (or potentially a distraction depending on you point of view) is that the dishes are grouped by the wines that would be accompany them - a novel approach."
3,Good Quality for the Price,No complaints. I'm pretty happy. The only thing I don't like is that the bits don't stay in place. Wish they locked in and wouldn't all get mixed up.
2,Case is poor quality,"I never actually got to use the tools because I spent 10 minutes sorting the bits into their proper places, only to have to do it again after I picked it up by the handle. That was enough for me to want to return it. The bits dont stay in place. If you dont care about that, this set is a great deal."
1,Save your money,The plastic thermoform case is poorly designed. I would expect a case that has a specific place for each item to hold those items in place when the case is closed. If you ever move this case the items inside will fall out of their slots into a jumbled mess. No thanks!!!
2,Pieces fall everywhere,I bought this because I needed something inexpensive with lots of choices of sizes.The pieces fall all over the place when you pick it up by the handel... Every time I am going to use it i have to hunt for the correct size...I would have sent it back but I forgot to return it in time...
4,Horrible case...but easily modified,"The sockets work well enough and have a decent verity for the price......but the case is absolutely horrible! It is made of cheap, thin, hollow plastic that is essentially disposable. The sockets are not held in place with friction, and the lid does not prevent them from moving around while the case is closed. The latches on the front do not snap closed effectively, so I have spilled the contents on multiple occasions.**Edit**I ended up attaching some fitted dense foam to the top of the case with double stick tape and the sockets are now held snugly in place. I'm still looking for a better locking mechanism, but with this easy modification, I now rate this with a solid four stars instead of 3."
1,Didn't notice any discernable benefit,"I've used this now for one month and really haven't noticed any discernable difference in my energy or anything else for that matter. There wasn't even a placebo effect for me thinking I was getting a veggie-fruit ""whammy"" that was going to be great for me. I wish it had done something. It would have been very convenient. Nice Package though."
2,too narrow for high arches,"This is a nice, pretty and comfortable-looking sandal, but this shoe fits too tightly on slightly high arched feet such as mine. I can almost always wear a medium in any shoe, but not in this case... and since I can't wear it in my normal size, I can't recommend it."
2,Short on features,"The Britannica Concise also comes in a downloadable version which if you have a good size sd card it would prove more convenient than whipping out an extra card dedicated only to the Britannica.I have both the Columbia down loadable Encyclopedia and this B.E. All around I much prefer the Columbia. It is much easier to navigate, it has plenty of options (the B.E. downloadable only has four/ beam,delete,fonts, and resolution) and is much funner to use. The only advantage this Britannica has over the Columbia is over all it has a few more entries...but not always more detailed.The B.E. claims to be 2006 but looking up ""Israel' for example it stopped at the end of 2000 after Israeli troops abruptly withdrew from Lebanon. The Columbia on the other hand went up to the Israeli conflict with Hezbollah in July 2006. The newest article I could find on the Britannica was 2005."
5,Great homework helper,I purchased this card for my 10 year old daughter to use with her homework. It's much faster and more efficient space wise and time wise. Great pictures and very informative.
1,"Basic, Erroneous, outdated","This article is way too basic. In fact, there is nothing offered that you cannot get from the CBOT website. Furthermore, many of the facts are erroneous. Take it from this Fed Funds trader at the CBOT: There is very little insight here for your money."
5,There will NEVER be another Book Of Love!,"I loved this group from the first time I heard them, and over 25 years later, the music still holds up! I bought the cassette to listen to in my car (I have all the cd stuff for home listening) and it really takes me back to a time when life was fun!"
5,New and Different - Yet the same,"I like depeche mode, yaz, gary numan, 80's etc. I have 3 of book of love's CD and I'd say this one is the best. If you are looking for more of the 80's synth pop sound this is a very nice Cd to listen to."
3,Not their best!,"I love Book of Love they have to be one of the best of the unknown groups of the 80's. This album has got some awkward tracks on it (unlike their next two albums: Lullaby and Candy Carol which is them at their absolute best). I can now appreciate that they were trying to get a feel for what their strong points were as a group at the time. Although I am a big fan I found this particular album to be lacking their usual cleverness and creativity. This is a must for the absolute fan, but probably not necessary for an 80's music collection."
1,Make it stop,"I accidentally bought this CD when it first hit the cut-out bins many years ago. I think I may have mixed them up with House of Love. I tried to give it a chance, but I could not stand listening to it. I just wanted to get rid of it.One night I was drinking and assembling furniture with one of my buddies, and I told him I was going to take the hammer and smash a CD. My friend, being a musician himself, thought it would be a crime to destroy a CD. So I put on ""Book of Love"", and soon we were in agreement. The CD has been eliminated from my collection."
5,And they are from the U.S.!,"I love Book Of Love. This CD is their first and, I think their best. Although Lullaby is excellent as well as Lovebubble. Candy Carol has the excellent Counting the Rosaries. The remixes of that are superb. Book Of Love are excellent. I love the fact that they are from the U.S., unlike PSB, Electronic/New Order, etc. This CD has dance songs as well as some beautiful songs like Modigliani (mixes are great too) and Happy Day. I wish they were still together. BUY THIS CD!!!! takes me back........"
4,great synthesizer music,"Back in highschool I'd listen to Sisters of Mercy and The Cult with my friends. After my friends leave, I'd play my Book of Love lp!"
5,Such a positive way to view the on-going revolution!,"Dent provides an excellent view of the current changes, backed by data on family purchasing cycles. He does a fantastic job of bouying one's spirit to take advantage of the internet revolution and provides tips on where and how to find more information to capitalize on the future's developments. If you wish to prepare yourself for the rest of this decade, I highly recommend this book."
4,"I Aree With the Reader from Portland, OR","I enjoyed Harry Dent's book, but he made some adjustments from his earlier book called the Great Boom Ahead. In the Great Boom Ahead, Mr. Dent had a hard time explaining the boom in the 1980's. In the Roaring 2000's, he explains the 1980's by saying that the baby boom started in the mid 1930's. The problem with that is that part of the generation is starting to retire now. This should start to put pressure on stocks going down now. Also, Mr. Dent expected some inflation in 1998 which would cause a correction in stocks. There are alot of economic problems, but none of them deal with inflation. Could it be the first boomers are starting to retire which is causing a deflationary spiral downward?"
1,A Bubble product,"Dent is so out of reality here. This book is a waste of money, time.He does not have any grasp of how the markets work.This is one of the worst books I've ever read if not the worst.Stay away from it and the hype that surounds it."
3,Refreshing change,"With a title like that how can you not read and believe? ;) It brought a little balance to MY reading, which is currently filled with gloom & doom. Its arguments are mostly demographic trending, plus other cycles, some unexplained. Incredibly, after many chapters extolling high tech & the internet and how it will bring vast changes to our lifestyles, it recommends stock investing in old line companies. But, don't worry, be happy!!! Things are going to be great!"
2,Lots of Baseless technical facts,The arguments presented are not very technically sound in my opinion
1,"In hindsight, what a load of hoey","I was one who bought this book on the advice of my financial guru in early 2000. Fast paced easy read, very very optimistic... ""The greatest boom in history"" Life was supposed to be grand. No way but up. DJIA would be 40 000 by 2010 etc. That was before my investments dropped by 30+% and have wallowed there ever since. This book should be read as a novel rather a how to reference book for finance!"
3,Some useful information,"I read this book back in the 1990s. It has some very useful information, but the author fails to consider all of the variables which contribute to markets. In hindsight, clearly his prediction was wrong regarding an anticipated overly robust economy during the 2000 to 2010 era. Nevertheless, those who are gloom and doom advocates (regarding the future) should read this book. You might learn something."
2,Idiot.,"Okay this book has some good parts and some very horrible parts.Good: Prediction of U.S. stock crash in 2008/09 due to demographic trends, analysis of demographics.Bad: Everything else, half the book goes into some other jibberish like tax.Another one of those pundits that thinks they got the market solved out, but simply no. =]"
1,Predictions are way off base,"I unfortunately own this book, and the projections are flat out wrong. Don't buy this book!"
4,Insightful and Optimistic on Technology's Economic Impact,"This is a very insightful view of what is yet to evolve in network technology and e-commerce. It outlines technology's anticipated impact on the future economy and industries of the U.S. over the next 10 years. Some of what he writes about has already developed.In particular, I was interested in his description of the technological ""S Curve"" (uses the example of automobile evolvement) and its comparison with the world's newest innovation...the internet.The tapes opened up my creative thoughts on opportunities in IT. It motivated me to embrace and grow with e-commerce and technology. I found it more ""to-the-point"", interesting, and less-biased than Bill Gates book, Business @ the Speed of Thought."
1,"Dent Total Waste, Try Sy Harding's ""Riding the Bear""","Unintentionally hilarious, Dent has been exposed as someone who was seemingly lucky in correctly calling the 90s bull market. Dent tried everything to hustle a buck when he was hot, in 2000 he was offering plans for financial professionals to use his strategies for their clients. This secular bear market will last for years, read Sy Harding's excellent ""Riding the Bear"" and Charles Caes' ""Tools of the Bear"" to profit from it. I have tripled my $$$ in less than 3 months with cash secured put options with info from the above 2 books. Harry Dent was merely a good salesman whose strategies will ruin you quickly!"
1,The Roaring Bear Market,"So far the author's predictions about tech stocks going into the third millennium are nothing short of a stinky trash can. Way to go Mr. Dent, tech stocks are down over 60%. Got anything to say in your defense? I didn't think so. You made one great call though, optimism does sell, doesn't it? I just hope you didn't follow your own advice and put the money you made on this book in tech stocks (^_^)"
2,Ooops,"Not a bad book, but this is what happens when you write a book in 1998, it comes out in 1999 and the economy changes in late 2000. As a fellow writer, who penned a book on mutual funds that also came out right before the downturn, I can relate to that feeling of wanting to take it off the shelves and make a few changes."
3,"Read it, threw it out; but hope to god it's right","I am agnostic about this book and admit I am not sure if I agree or disagree, Yes, it seemed to makes sense when I read it first, but look at what has happened the the last 3 years since it was written. It sure as hell make a Dent (pun intended) in his theories, doesn't it. The book gave me confidence to keep most of my retirement savings in equity mutual funds, much to my dismay. I still have 20 years to wait (or MUCH MUCH longer, depending on what you believe) until I ""retire"" (?) at 65. Read this book, but with a huge grain of salt."
1,Is this man still making predictions?,"And if so, are his books still selling? That's the only roaring mystery to me."
1,worthless,"After reading this book, I felt like having been robbed of my time and money. Not only was Mr. Dent too optimistic, but rather misguiding in his advice and arguments. The book has no value whatsoever and will do more harm to anybody who reads it."
1,The worst book I have read in years,"An absolutely terrible book, full of excessive superlatives and short on convincing evidence. On nearly every page of the book, the author makes the claim that we are approaching the greatest boom in human history, yet never makes a convincing case as to why. The book is chalk full of empty statements upon which little elaboration is provided. Harry Dent has successfully taken a quite intuitively compelling argument regarding the economic implication of certain demographic trends and rendered it thoroughly unconvincing. The weakness of this book is not the result of a flawed premise (I actually agree with the basic argument), but rather results from poor writing, redundancy, inappropriate use of data, poor examples and excessive hyperbole. I read approximately 20 books per year, and The Roaring 2000s is the worst book I have read in years."
2,Pop goes the bubble,"Even before the wild melt down that started the year this wildly optimistic book came out, it was quite possible to read Dent's model as simplistic. He has taken one very valid insight - that demographic booms, particularly the baby boom, can drive economic growth, and focused on it to the exclusion of all else. He feels the demographics cause all other factors(inflation, entrepreneurship, interest rates, etc.) and believes that a predictable pattern is clear. Well, Harry, what's your portfolio worth now compared to 1/1/00? So much for predictability. Remember Warren Buffet, who said that economic forecaster's main role in business was to make fortune tellers look good."
4,"A good follow up from his best book ""The Great Boom Ahead""","Once again Dent does a good job of explaining the working factors of basic economics in layman's terms. His view of the next 10 years is reasonable and well supported. Although I beleive that ""The Great Boom Ahead"" was much more specific and provided the data to support his assumptions, this book takes that information to the next level. I would recommend reading that book prior to this one. Once you've read it, you will surely order ""Roaring 2000's""!"
4,This book is optimism in a pessimistic world.,"Harry Dent has done a valuable service to the average investor who wants to end up above average. I loved the optimism and common sense revealed in the demographic data. However, the downturn mentioned in 2006 - 2008, and lasting several years afterward, left me wondering about the following...The baby boomers will be receiving massive medication and health care as well as spending big bucks on leisure. Why a down turn in view of these two facts? Maybe I am overly optimistic, but I don't see as major a downturn as he predicts at the end of this current cycle. Remember....Grandparents spend big bucks, and those after 2006 - 2008 will still be fueling the greatest economy of all time. Thanks to Mr. Dent for showing us the sunshine for a change."
2,Disappointing,"After reading Dent's superb book ""The Great Boom Ahead"" I was really looking forward to this book. However, aside from repeating himself, this book provides little new insight. Stick with his other book, and don't waste your time on this one."
5,You Need This Book--Author of Diary of A Sick Chick,"If you or someone you love has lupus, I think that this book should be on your nightstand. It's on mine in the hardcopy AND I have it on my Kindle. It is THE book for lupus patients. For those stating that the book is quite technical...it does have it's moments but please don't think that you need a Bachelor's degree to understand it. I don't and I understood it just fine.I notice that when it comes to writing books of this subject matter, some books are criticized for being too easy to understand, while others are criticized that they are too technical. One could say that this book has enough information for a beginner to understand as well as information for those who are looking for more technical information.If you have lupus, this should be the first book that you buy. I don't agree with everything Dr. Wallace says on the topic but it is a great starting place and I highly recommend it."
4,starting over with lupus,"Eight years ago I was diagnosed with discoid lupus. Two weeks ago the disease transitioned to my kidneys creating an entire new situation for me to deal with... Having The Lupus Book as reference, allowed me to re-acquaint myself with things I knew and learn about this latest manifestation. For most of us, lupus is chronic & ongoing. A book like this will travel as your companion if/when your disease takes a different form. Sensitive and intelligent - this book is a truly caring guide for anyone coping with a changing illness."
5,A must-read for all lupus patients,A very comprehensive book that covers different organ systems that lupus can affect. The information is updated and enables the readers to discuss intelligently with theirs doctor about the symptoms and treatments. The author successfully conveys complex medical information in layman terms. The book is rich in contents but should not be difficult to understand for anyone. All lupus patients and their familities should add this book to their lupus literature collection.
3,Too technical,"Although I have a Master's degree in Biology, I found the book to be extremely technical. No feelings, no emotions; just a lot of hard facts. It is definitely a well researched and all inclusive book, but not my style."
2,Quite technical,The book is very technical in nature that is geared more toward health care professionals rather than general readership. There are portions of the book that are informative for those with Lupus and their families. I would not recommend reading this book prior to reading several others that are geared to the Lupus patient and their family.
2,very technical,This book is good but VERY technical...Good thing I am a nurse...I gave it to some of my family to read and they truly could not understand a lot of the book. It is great information but make sure you have a medical dictionary handy if you aren't familiar with medical terminology.
5,Dr. Wallace's book is a must have for any lupus patient,"I've been using this book as a resource to better understand lupus since the first edition. It is an invaluable resource, written by one of the world's leading lupus authorities, Dr. Daniel Wallace. For any one who has this illness, get this book! It will help you educate yourself, and your loved ones, about symptoms, complications and treatments."
5,Just what I was looking for-a lupus reference book!,"I have been searching for information that compiles lupus information in one place. True, it is not the only place, but what an informative, easy to read source. I also appreciate the appendices providing lupus resources for further information. If anyone knows of current lupus research or trials, I would be interested to learn more (email: lewisgreen@bellsouth.net). My daughter is 23 and was diagnosed 2 years ago. So young and we are interested in improving her quality of life. Thank you."
2,Too technical,My wife and I found this quite difficult to read although there is a great deal of very useful information on the book.
3,Author has a newer book,"This book is a very good summary of The Fourteen Points, developed by W. Edwards Deming. However, William W. Scherkenbach has a newer book that actually comments on many portions of Deming's work and gives excellent information on how to implement these ideas in your company. The title of this newer book is ""Deming's Road to Continual Improvement,"" published by SPC Press"
4,Horsemen Classic,"The finest portion of this video is, unquestionably, the classic struggle between Horsemen teammates and family members, ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair and ""The Enforcer"" Arn Anderson. The two best wrestlers in WCW went head to head for the fans in their own backyard: Asheville, NC. This match gives the video its rating, despite the rest of the card."
5,This event was great,The wargames match & anderson vs. flair match were great. Two of the best matches of all time definately.
1,FALL BRAWL 95,this event was bad very bad. do your self a favor get something else oldschool / newschool THIS SUCKS
1,A word about the recondition models,"I thought i was getting a bargain, but i recieved a well used mixer. It was missing several parts. It was scratched on most surfaces. It also lacked a safty spring. This was the worst recondition model I have ever seen.Guess I'll send it back. Just a warning, one of you will see this one again. BTW, it was red."
3,A little disappointed,"If you are looking for a book to inspire your home decorating then this book is great. It gives the reader a lovely look around Debbie Mumm's home and shows us how to acheive the same painted effects in our homes. If you, like me, are looking for a book that deals with soft furnishings and quilts then this is NOT the book for you. I have some of Debbie Mumm's other titles and love them but I was expecting something different when I ordered this one."
2,Ok for the Coffee Table,"I am a big fan of Debbie Mumm's designs and I had hoped for more. The decorating tips and techniques are limited, and are published in lots of other more useful design books. Some of the more unsual ideas, especially in her son's room are just not mentioned. Nice pictures of her house, but thats it."
5,Great Product,This is a product we have used for as long as I can remember. Its very hard to find in the stores anymore. My family loves to use it on macaroni and a variety of other foods.
5,Great on so many things,"This product is the best. I use all the time. Put it on popcorn, pizza macaroni and cheese for extra flavor."
5,Great for many uses,I have been using Kraft Cheese powder on my Spagetti and on popcorn for many many years. I have never found any other grated or powdered cheese that come even close to the taste of this cheese. Experiment and try it on many other things. even take plain Potato Chips and make them into a mouth watering treat.
5,my family loves this,I love the convenience of having these shipped to the door. My family loves the product.
5,Wish this was at a store,I grew up with this stuff (used to be in a gold can). I use this alot and not just for popcorn or Baked Macaroni. I just wish it was available in a store near me.
5,Love this product!,"I can't eat popcorn without my Kraft Macaroni and Cheese topping! I used to buy at Wal-mart but they seem to have stopped selling it. It was the only place I could ever find it and when I did find it, I would buy at least 4 canisters at a time. I was so happy to see that I could find it here on amazon. I hope they keep a supply and don't stop making this. I think I might be addicted to it."
5,Kids love it,"My daycare kids love it on rice, pasta, peas, or almost anything, as long as it has the orange cheese on it. I love it on popcorn."
5,WHAT IS KRAFT THINKING?!,"Why is a product this good so hard to get a hold of? Used to find it at King Soopers, then it was gone. My folks found it at the super Walmart in McPherson, Kansas and now its gone again. If I was Kraft I would make sure this product was in every major grocery store. You can't even get it from Kraft's website. Thanks Amazon for having it available!"
4,good product bad price,love the stuff but there is no way i will pay that much for it when i can get 3 6ct boxes for less than the price he is asking thats crazy
3,Kraft macaroni and cheese topping,Not bad. Not as cheesy as i would have hoped. I remember it being better as a kid.
1,Not worth the money,This table was not bad to assemble however for the money I expected something that was a lot sturdier than this. I am afraid to use it for a cutting surface as is jiggles when touched even a little. I do not recommend.
3,"Not 36"" high","Purchased this table and am returning it. The description says that the table is 36"" high. It is not. It is barely 34 1/2"" high.The table is a little flimsy but I can live with that because it does not get moved a lot. But at 5'7"" I need the 36"" height.If you are expecting a table that has the dimensions as described, do not buy the Sullivan Home Hobby Table made in China.Wished there was a table out there which is high enough and does not cost an arm and a leg."
4,It's good enough,"I bought this for my wife's quilting projects. My neighbor has one too and uses it for quilting. There aren't many choices out there in this price range and surface size. Yes, it's a bit shaky, but it's not a pool table or dining table - it works just fine for what it's purpose is and folds/stores great. We bought the Alvin 48x36 cutting mat - she is now feeling like a professional quilter (better than crawling on the floor and making multiple cuts). Maybe she will actually make a quilt for us?"
3,Nice table but not sturdy enough,"A nice size, and easy to move around and adjust the size. But not very sturdy when using it to cut fabric. Good for the price however."
3,Pretty good cutting table,"My apartment isn't very big and this works well for my space, especially since it folds down. It is a little difficult to lock the legs that hold up the leafs in place, but not that bad. I'm 5'3"" and the hieght works really well for me. Might not be as great for a tall person. I've seen some reviews that said this isn't sturdy, but it seems sturdy enough to me."
4,OK,"It's an OK product and for the price you can't beat it, not hard to setup not sure how will it will hold up but so far does what i bought it for"
5,love it,I love it. It was perfect for my needs. Loved that it folds down and can be easily moved around when I am finished working. Great for small work spaces like mine.
1,PIECE OF CRAP,DO NOT BUY. It is wobbly and not worth it. Im donating my table to the firepit. DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY
4,"Good, fun story","S.O. is really a very entertaining story. Masahiro is a thirteen year old boy who wants to be a sorcerer, unfortunately for him, his grandfather is the greatest one around and he sealed his powers. But all of a sudden he was able to see a demon and his abilities start to show again, unlocking his sixth sense. Gauron starts following him around and helping him fight evil demons, all this is just training in order for him to become the greatest sorcerer ever alive. In this dvd the plot presented to the viewer and characters are introduced. All five episodes flow nicely and there really isn't one that can be considered a filler. Entertaining story and nice animation, but nothing out of the ordinary, characters are nicely drawn and the Japanese voice actors are good. Haven't listened to the dubbed version. Overall a good investment, since the story consists of only 26 episodes with no fillers, each dvd so far has had five episodes each."
3,video tape,"I received this item as a gift off my wish list. When I tried to play it, it broke. It cost me $20.00 to have it fixed."
2,Surf shop tips over,This toy would be fun for my 5 year old if we could keep it from tipping over! My daughter has a doll house that we purchased when she was just 2 and it is very sturdy. We re-arranged the furniture so that she could put the Surf Shop and a beauty salon playset on the top floor. The surf shop items are constantly tipping over and the little assessories fall out of the dollhouse and onto the bedroom floor where our dog promptly picks them up and chews on them.
1,Does not work,"I do not think this works for me. Tried several times, each time making me feel a little weird.Of all the anti-aromase supplements on the market, DIM from Source Naturals is the only thing that has worked for me."
5,Powerful Politics and Pain,"To avoid repetition, I just want to add that the writing is stunning -- a combination of directness and poetic politics. One of the most compelling aspects of the book is its contemplation of machismo and its attraction to women, even lesbians. Issues of violence and battering within straight and lesbian relationships are also powerfully addressed. To write a book with a protagonist who is not particularly sympathetic is quite risky. I applaud Ms. Obejas loud and long for her decision to do so. One note of caution: this author does not mince words when she is describing sex or violence."
5,Memory Mambo,"When I purchased Memory Mambo to read for a class, I had no idea that this book would shape my life. While reading, I felt a connective pull towards the main character in the book. Her life story, though different than mine, reflected many similarities and parallels. I felt that everything I have studied thus far all culminated in this one work of literature. Achy Obejas' writing spoke to me so strongly that I have recently purchased another of her books. I highly recommend this book to anyone, but especially those interested in Latina or lesbian culture."
5,simple but wonderful,a wonderful book which will lift you it is easy to follow little parts of the secret which is a favorite of mine also the calling of your true self which is perfect partner in the uk all these put together will open your mind to the spirit world and what is out there well done steven
2,The Real Secret,"Although I found this book to be inspiring, the concept of ""going with the flow"" is an essential concept of the Abraham-Hicks teachings. It's about keeping up with the expanded version of you. This expanded version or Source Energy is calling you toward what you have created.The real secret is that we are Source energy (GOD) in a physical body.To fully understand this profound concept, I highly recommend the teachings of Esther Hicks, channeling Abraham. they were in the original version of ""The Secret"", but the producers cut them out, thinking the public wasn't ready to hear this information. And isn't that interesting, the film states that Law of Attraction had been kept from the public over the centuries, and they're doing the very same thing. Trying to say that Law of Attraction is a secret, is like saying The Law of Gravity is a secret."
5,Struggle is optional!,"This book is a delightful read. Steven Lane Taylor guides us in opening to the everyday miracles that simplify and bring joy into our lives. In a light and entertaining manner, he clearly demonstrates how our efforts to control create struggle in our lives. He shows us, in very doable steps, how to let go and reap the benefits of being in the flow. This book is one of those rare owner's manuals life should have come with. Read it. Anytime you find life being hard, read it again."
5,Packed with wisdom!,"This little book is focused, succinct, highly practical and understandable. It is the clearest explanation of how to effortlessly manifest your heart's desires that I have ever read. And best of all, it works!"
1,To cheap,"I never buy such a cheap product. Half of the songs are damaged.Because I am very engaged to my work, I passed the return window.Please don't buy."
4,Annoying title; really good book.,"I don't know who made the author -- or who let the author -- use such a stupid title. The author's a woman, for starters, and running dogs are a great safety boon to female runners. Notwithstanding the title, the book is quite good. It contains general information for novice human and dog runners; it contains charts and reviews about the running ability of different breeds; and it contains detailed information about training and first aid for your running dog. Well worth the price."
1,Beware!,This game is not MGS. It is some type of strange RPG/Card game. Wish I would have done my research before buying.Guess this game will appear to some people but not those who like MGS. Total misrepresentation. Wish I could get my money back. Guess we have to wait for the game developers to take some chances on the PSP and produce good games. Maybe the PSP2 will have better games.
2,What were they thinking?,"Every other Metal Gear game was fun all the way back to NES... but MGS 2 was annoying for the HORRIBLE kiddish love story they threw in with their 2 hour cutscenes... That pissed me off. Now this. Im sorry, but id say a majority of Metral Gear fans are very disapointed with this game... TURN BASED?!? what were they thinking? I guess there a few who have the patience to deal with that, but im not one of them. I personally didnt but the game, but I borrowed it from someone to check it out to see if the turn based thing was as bad as it sounded... and yep, it was. DO NOT THINK THIS IS A SHOOTER. OMG, LieK I HAV 13 HP and YOU HAvE 9 I WIN!!! jesus, whoever came up with that concept should be shot."
3,Well...,"i got this game along with my psp due to it being a release game, but also because it was getting rave reviews. Now let me tell you it does not live up to the hype, but it does give off some innovative gameplay. I'm not saying this game is bad but, it does loose intrest once you die a couple of times. so overall this is decent game to get, and a great one if you like card based games."
2,waste of money,"I bought this game at an airport. At first I was excited thinking it was going to be on par with the other metal gear games. To my surprise, this game is nothing like the previous ones. The card based play is slow, boring, and lacks the continuity of the other games. If you think it's going to be like the others don't waste your money. Needless to say, that flight was boring, I actually opted to read the United airlines flight magazine instead."
3,Just doesn't add up for me,"I really think that a card-based strategy game just doesn't work out for Metal Gear. The cut scenes are long, and you're mostly just staring at the same image for fifteen minutes.When it comes to gameplay, I was baffled. I first tried to sneak around everyone, like you should in a Metal Gear game, but that never worked out. Then, I'd try to just kill anyone that was too close to me, but that didn't work because I never got the cards I needed. Then, once I was finished with the missions, I'd always get a D or lower, because they mark you down if you kill someone, are seen, or take to long, which I always did.Buy this game at your own risk, because it's frustrating and takes some patience."
1,"This might be a waste of your money, but i might not","Personally, i did not enjoi this game. I feel that most of the previous metal gear solids were good, but this one just isnt any good at all. To start playing it is confusing and the cards are sometimes hard to understand. It is difficult to understnad how most of the cards work. The graphic were not as good as they could had been for a psp. The style of using cards is not as good as you might or might not think it is."
1,The worst portable game ever!!!!!,"I am a huge Metal Gear fan. The reason I play the game is to experience an action game. This game has been down graded to a deck of cards. Instead of real time movement of the player you have to use one of a few available cards that control your movements. You lose some of the best aspects of the game. The graphics are first rate. That is the only good part of the game. Finally, the endless conversations between the different characters make game play near impossible."
1,NO SIR! I DON'T LIKE IT,"Metal Gear is not, i repeat NOT made to be a card game. What were they thinking.The Don"
2,Its not what Metal gear fans want.,"what you have here is a great portable system and a great game francise,so why is it that when they made a metel gear game for the PSP they didn't make a MG game with classic gameplay,which WOULD HAVE been a hit,but take a card based formula?I don't see the DS coming out with a Mario game with card based gameplay...I don't hate the game,i'm just saying it could have been something much,much,better"
1,W.T.F!,"um.... no! if I wanted to play a card game, I'd go play a card game! I bought my PSP to play on the subway on my way to work, and this game is so slow that I make virtually no progress during a 20 minute trian ride! I LOVED most of the previous Metal Gear's but 1 hour of playing this game makes me want to lite myself on fire!"
1,Its lame! Don't waste your money...,Very long and boring movies between scenes. Way to slow play. It needs more action...
1,Tricked,"Have you ever played Metal Gear Solid? Sneaking around, silently killing, and avoiding detection, you work through each level with a great story line. Not so in Metal Gear Acid. The main flaw in the story line is that the main characters tell you how to use the cards, completely ruining the reality of the story line.I bought this game thinking of how much I liked the other Metal Gear games. This is the worst game released with the title of Metal Gear. To move, you need a card, to kill, you need a card, to defend yourself you need a card. If you get into a tough spot, unless you have the right cards, you're stuck. It is nothing like the other games in the series.If you can actually get behind a bad guy, without your turn ending and him discovering you, you cannot choke him or drag him using him as a shield. All you can do is punch him, if you don't have a card to shoot him.Overall, this is one of the worst games I have ever played. Do not waste your hard earned money on this worthless game."
1,Worthless,"This is only a few pages of discussion of volitility. Doesn't show how to calculate volitility, or how to really use volitility,is outdated, and time has proven it worthless. Its only value, is to tell us that Holders are more volitile than broad indexes like ETF's, and as volitility implies, any investment will go up or down in the next year."
4,Lovecraft at his best.,"I agree with the reviewer who said the stories are better each time you read them for the most part.In the Case of Chareles Dexter Ward, however, I still remember being absolutely glued to the book the first time I read the story. I still think it the best thing H.P. ever did for sheer horror."
3,the case is the best,"at the mountain of madness is a story about an expedition to the arctic, finding knowledge that will destroy their view on the world. unfortunately, that's it. i want more. just finding things out in such a manner, didn't give me the chill. then there's storie about randolph carter going to a strange place. very dunsany-like. i got confused. but mostly i got bored. so he goes around in this strange place. it really isn't that suspenceful. no, the great stories here are the short story ""the dreams in the withch-house"" - a good stroy about a man haunted by dreams in a place haunted by evil spirits, and ""the case of charles dexter ward"" - a story about obsession. a man explores the occult, and is more and more controlled by something else. a really good novel. the change is very lovely described, a lot of details. one of the very best horror novels simply because of the way it is lain out for us."
1,Alternative edition for Kindle,"Without figures, this edition is useless. But fortunately there is a Kindle edition WITH figures available at the gutenberg site. So you'd better go there. The rules for reviews prevent me to name the URL, but I am sure you can find it"
5,Great resource!,A wonderful resource for every teacher. Rasinski offers great advice/ideas for building fluency - a model for best practice and a reminder to move past round robin.
2,Fluent Reader,"I bought this book to help with a research project. While I used tiny bits of it, there really wasn't anything new or stimulating in the book. Other sources are more comprehensive."
5,Textbook,"This book is fantastic! It is easy reading with ideas that are applicable the moment you start reading. I teach kindergarten and some of the ideas had to be watered down to meet my needs, but for grades 1-8th it is perfect.I ususally get rid of a book after I've read it, but not this one. It is a great reference book for any teacher. I highly recommend this book."
3,Useful & Practical,"I was looking for some basic information on walnut growing and this old book had what I wanted. Some of the info (re Growers etc) is outdated, but all the 'technical' advice is useful. I appreciate access to such material."
3,Difficult to hold probes onto the battery,"As per other comments, it really is difficult to hold a battery in your hands and place the probes on each end. The tiniest slip off the tip of the batter results in a ""low"" reading on what might otherwise be a perfectly good battery. The gage works great, is easy to read and very responsive. This model could use a way to mount batteries or a clip to hold them as many other testers have."
4,battery tester should not be this hard to find,"a decent low priced battery tester should not be this hard to find, but it took quite a while to find this product. no local hardware or electronics stores seemed to carry this item or the clerks simply did not know where to find them.my old tester broke several years ago so i was very happy to get this unit. it works just fine."
1,GB stands for garbage No stress test,"Tests voltage, not the charge. Does not display how many volts, only shows in in the area.Not worth $20, maybe 2-3 no more."
4,Very pleased.,Very happy with my choice. Works well. Basic tester for most types of batteries. The price is right. Received promptly.
5,Works as advertised,It's simple to use and it shows whether the battery needs to be replaced. It works as advertised and I would buy another if I needed one.
1,Piece of Junk,"You get what you pay for sometimes. I wanted a cheap battery tester. This was cheap, only problem is that it did not work. The tester measurement arm moved the OPPOSITE direction on the meter when testing a brand new fully charged battery. It had to have been installed backwards or incorrectly. What a joke. I returned it and now need to find a WORKING quality tester."
4,Good Tester,"This is a good and reliable battery tester. Better than using a volt meter which does not put a laod on the battery so you don't get a true reading. I only wish it gave a more precise reading of the charge...but hay, for the money this is a great tool and I recomend it."
5,Battery Tester,This is an excellent item for the money. It works great and is very portable and accurate. I meanly purchased it to test regular batteries and my boat battery. Thank you!
4,It's what I was looking for.,So many crappy battery checkers out there. This one is accurate and I highly recommend it. If you're looking for a battery tester this is it.
5,Excellent,I buy my tea here because when on special its cheaper than wal-mart and I drink lots of tea. Watch for the free shipping and specials you'll save a ton of money. The more you buy the more you save.
1,Buyer Beware!! Not as pictured,"Just be aware (BEFORE ORDERING) that this item is for the CUP SIZE tea bag product - NOT the Family Size (as shown in the product picture). There is a big difference in the size of the tea bags themselves. Just be aware of this fact before you order this product.If you want the Family Size tea bags, they are here:Lipton Iced Tea, Decaffeinated, Tea Bags, 24-Count Boxes, (Pack of 12)The product received the 1 star because of the listing issue not being correct. The product itself is GREAT!"
1,Tiny bit narrow,Never covered up the electrical box completely.It was a little narrow. But used it anyway. Wouldn't of purchasedIt if I had know first.
3,Not Bad...,"I managed to acquire every Calla release half of which aren't even listen on amazon.com or most of the internet, and was somewhat surprised to see this available here. As far a remix albums go, its not bad at all... MUCH better than the Low remix album (I gave it 1 star) Some of the remixes are interesting and good alternative versions to the songs and a few were lacking, over all not bad. The two lives tracks are great, and while I wouldn't buy the cd for that reason only, they are certainly an incentive."
3,Interesting remixes for the Calla-hungry,"This CD contains (with the exception of 2 live tracks) some interesting elecronic'ed-up remixes from Scavengers. Some of the tracks are pretty good, other just sound like 2 different records playing at the same time. If you're really hungry for more Calla get it....otherwise if you don't have Scavengers pick it up first- it's fantastic!"
3,Required text book,I have to read this book for a class. It has interesting real life case studies. If you need mediation pointers it would be good to have the case studies to refer to.
2,Disappointing read,"I found this a very difficult book to get into. Pyatt grossly overuses the flashback technique. If I had been beta reading for her I would have suggested that the backstory come in no more than three long flashbacks instead of a multiplicity of short flashbacks. (Approximately half of the first 60 pages is flashbacks.) As soon as I became interested in the story of Cain I would be thrown into a flashback.Pyatt has an interesting idea of making Cain and Abel twins with the girl being the first born. That intrigued me. I agree with another reviewer that the dialogue is stilted. What bothers me more is the characters we should care about are sketchily delineated.For me this is a good idea, good feminisist revisionist history, poorly developed."
2,guidelines odicy,"well, this CD is alright but it's nothing special. The best and strongest song on this CD is in fact ""no more love songs"". I find that there really isn't anything too origional and I don't consider this goth music. Goth music for me is the cure, depeche mode, the cult, switchblade symphony, ect... This is more going towards london after midnight, but L.A.F. is much better band than this one. Don't waste your time with this CD unless someone can prove me wrong."
1,Fictitious,"I really enjoyed the story until I flipped to the copyright page where it states: ""All characters and events portrayed in this book are fictitious"". I feel a little deceived and I am very dissapointed."
5,Plainly the Most Impressive One They Ever Made,"Wow! I just couldn't believe it when I listened to the songs from this album. I don't own the album but this album is really impressive! I had never listened to synth in a very dark mood like this. The songs are gripping!Although I thought A Question of Time was a bit annoying and A Question of Lust a bit slow for my taste, I mainly liked the songs New Dress and Stripped. In my opinion, I think in Stripped, Dave has a really beautiful voice as well as haunting. In New Dress, I like the lyrics a lot. Black Celebration is pretty good too.So is this album worth buying? Sure, it's very good."
4,"Deep, Dark, and Depressing...","With ""Black Celebration"", Depeche Mode marked a transformation from happy, bouncy, new-wave pop into the funereal halls of gothic depression.With death and destruction as the major themes, ""Black Celebration"" will emotionally move you into another state of mind. It might be a good idea to keep some Prozac on hand when playing this album.I highly recommend this one."
4,when this album went out i was only 1 years old!,"so, it's a very good album, my fav songs are: ""here is the house"" and ""but not tonight"". this one could be my fav dm songs of all time....but i don't know it yet. in italy ""here is the house"" was covered by an italian band called Bluvertigo. the song in italian is ""Complicità"". it's very nice, but dm original version is better!"
1,This CD Is Missing Something!!,"I bought this CD because the 2 disc remastered set put out by Rhino Records does not have ""But Not Tonight"" on the main disc. Its on the DVD disc as an extra cut. This import was suppose to have ""But Not Tonight"" on it. Its listed in the description, but its NOT on the disc. My first return to Amazon."
5,Black Days,"I love the style of Depeche Mode, never the ordinary always unique. That's why they've been around for so long. My favorite songs are Black Celebration, Flys on the Windscreen, and a Question of Time. When I heard this album it reminded me of a new band called Chambre Noir. They use soundtracks and electronics as the backdrop of their music also. I hope Depeche comes to San Antonio again on their tour."
3,The dark times of Depeche Mode,"This album was recorded when Martin Gore's sister killed himself, reflecting this particular fact in most of the songs of the album. This LP introduces hits that will be reviewed later on 101, such as Sometimes, A question of Lust, etc. It's a good album, but it isn't representative of the entire DM music."
3,Great Thematic Album,"This whole album does seem to fit with the ""Black"" or dark theme (with ""But Not Tonight"" being the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak), but the best Depeche Mode album (Violator of course) had more songs that could stand up on their own. I found myself getting bored with this album somewhere during ""Here is the House"". In fact, the only song I really care for after ""Question of Time"" is the aforementioned ""But Not Tonight"". ""Question of Time"" was easily my favorite after the first listen, but it quickly grew old and I've come to like ""But Not Tonight"" and especially ""Question of Lust"" (a song which proves that Martin Gore should sing lead vocal in more DM songs), the best.This was definitely the turning point for Depeche Mode, but it was a turn that, barring Violator, didn't produce much more than a few extremely dark but average albums."
3,The songwriting often matches the mood: dreary,"While there are only a few really good songs on Black Celebration, namely ""Here Is the House,"" ""Stripped,"" ""A Question of Time,"" and ""But Not Tonight,"" the album's strength lies in its unremitting dark mood. From the desperation expressed in the title track to the nihilism of ""World Full of Nothing"" to the futility voiced in ""New Dress,"" there's no question that the album has a distinct tone. What Black Celebration needs more of to be a great downer album is songwriting on par with Joy Division's Closer or Alex Chilton's Sister Lovers."
3,Overrated,"This is good. Some great songs, but you still feel they are maturing, but not yet matured. In my opinion this will happen with Music for the masses. A good album anyway."
2,gaseous,"Kind of a strange album: indisputably from DM's prime, but doesn't contain any of the songs DM is known for. It's almost as though it's one of those dreary compilation albums consisting of B-sides, although it's not presented that way."
5,The best dark depressing synth of all time,"I don't think Depeche Mode could follow up Some Great Reward any better. This has to be one of the best albums I've ever heard. So dark, so emotional, so beautiful. Black Celebration was what intrigued me to get the cd, but that was just the first song. A Question of Lust, Sometimes, It Doesn't Matter Two, A Question of Time, Stripped, Here Is the House, World Full of Nothing, and New Dress. Not any better way to end the album then New Dress. (And of course But Not Tonight tagged on to the end on the CD version) I can't say enough about this album, wish Depeche Mode was still this good."
5,i colonial deep massage body cream with Myrrh,Have used this for years and had to go all the way to Italy to find it and now I've run out. Miss it. Was surprised that it was listed on Amazon and I hope it returns :(
3,Not nearly as great as Keasbey Nights,"When I first heard this CD, I was a bit dissapointed. They lack the energy that they had in 'Keasbey Nights'. After Tom Kalnoky (the lead singer) left the band they seemed to have gone downhill. The lyrics and vocals are weak, the guitar and bass isn't as good, and the horn section isn't as strong, but the drumming is still amazing. There are a few good songs, like 'It takes some time' and some others, but it does NOT compare to 'Keasbey Nights'. You should get this anyways, but if you are just getting into Catch 22, get 'Keasbey Nights""."
2,what happened to the first singer?,"well i would like to start off by saying this album is not bad by any means as it has some great songs on it. However, the new singer doesnt make the songa as lively as the last one. and 'keasbey nights' was much more varied than 'alone in a crowd' as far as the sound of thr band goes. so again, not necasarily bad, but a disapointment for me as a catch 22 fan."
2,Stick with Keasbey Nights,"This album lacks the great original and creative vibe that Keasbey Nights has. One thing that was kicked up on this album however, was the horn section...a lot tighter and good solos. The vocals really fell short."
3,its okay...,"this is an okay cd, it defiantly doesn't compare to Keasbey nights. there are a few good songs on here like ""it takes some time"" ""thinking about things"" and ""what goes around..."" But if you are just getting into catch 22, get Keasbey nights, that was pretty much their only really great cd."
5,Amazing!!,"i didn't think Catch 22 could surpass what they did on Keasbey Nights (which is also great), but they did with this album. It blends punk, ska, hardcore, and everything else into one of the best cds of the year, by far. The horns are great, as are the vocals. There are strings on two of the tracks, and overall this would get more than 5 stars if i could."
5,When we were outgunned and outnumbered,"I first read this book in 5th grade, over a quarter century ago. It's an awesome story about how brave young men went up against the stronger Japanese military. In the months after Pearl Harbor, these men fought like lions to blunt the Japanes expansion in the central Pacific. The stories told here offer great ""day in the life of"" stories as well as stirring battle accounts. That's one of the great and underappreciated things about the war in the Pacific against Japan: we won our first victories against vastly superior Imperial forces. This book is a great read."
2,broke first time I used the thing,"I tried powerwashing my driveway with this thing and it broke before 5 min. of use. One of the seals gave out and water was spraying everywhere..man I was soaked! The pressure was good before it broke, but afterwards, it was easier to just use the hose. I'm going to try and get the thing replaced, but if B&S don't I'm going with another brand. Overall I was very disappointed with this product, and I hope you don't buy one."
1,Bad piggy,"Everything was great until I saw the piggy bank which has repeated printing on both sides and it should have different printing on each side since I own another one just like it, very disappointed!"
3,Not bad for the price,"The picture makes this clock look much more substantial than it is; however, it's not a bad deal for the price. The numbers are large enough to be read from across a room, which is what I needed in my husband's office (since he ""forgets"" the time while playing video games). But if you're looking for something fancy and formal, this won't measure up."
4,Great performance,"I mostly agree with others reviewers. The recording is great, sound is clear (although it's a live performance) and has a great range from pianissimo to full power.The choir is (are, actually, there are three of them!) fantastic, I didn't put 5 stars only for the bass: he'is not at the same level as the others singers, if you look for a ghiaurov or tallvela replacement look somewhere else.Anyway, this is probably the best recording I have ever listened to, wheighting al the pros and cons.Highly recommended!!"
2,"Abbado falls short, again","Abbado had an earlier Verdi Requiem from La Scala that suffered from being underpowered, and this one is similar. It's odd that he can't catch on to the pasionately operatic spirit of this work. Certainly one expects him to, but by halfway through I lost interest entirely. Alagna doesn't rival the best tenor soloists with his grainy voice and blaring manner. His wife Gheorghiu is much better but a bit remote and chilly when she should be warm and reverent. The chorus and orchestra sound fine, but that's not enough in a work that has received great readings from Toscanini, De Sabata, Giulini, Reiner, Karajan, and Fricsay, just to mention a few."
4,another winner from Abbado and Ericson,"The performance is amazing. The colors and dynamics are wonderful, as was expected from groups that have been influenced by Eric Ericson's work. And maestro Abbado is always thrilling. One hopes that he recovers quickly from is illness again."
5,Powerful!,I purchased this CD in anticipation of attending a live performance of the piece. The Berlin Philharmonic is excellent and the combined choruses are absolutely fantastic! All the soloists' voices are first rate. I highly recommend this CD!
3,too stately,"is a perfume whose fragrance is too stately, not recommended for young people. The fragrance does not last long. recommended for old ladies"
3,Pretty Good,"I read these books to help myself understand my religion a bit more. They arent written well, but they're cute, fast reads. But unless you're really religious, they might seem a bit pushy."
4,Sometimes I feel so bad,"The intrigue of this soundtrack is that it shows Prince's range. Due to the blandness of the film, I think this CD is often overlooked for its merit. It widely swings from bare soulful depths (Sometimes it Snows...) to fun ensemble pieces (Christopher Tracy...) through the more established sound of Prince, between. The music from this release did not get much attention, but in terms of observing Prince's development as an artist, you can't overlook where this phase of his sound led him in later productions. It was a turnkey era in his career."
5,Seventeen Celestial Compositions Composting,"into Cosmopolitan Music Sponge's Nightmares. This is my absolute most preciously beloved O(+> album and movie. Low ratings can sometimes (actually often times) be a compliment. U know, two negatives make a positive. Every track is beyond me. This album incorporates displacement. It is again, not in correspondence to any earthly date, nor does it seem to be a product. Bone the critics E* me if you believe ""Under the Cherry Moon"" is a divinely whimsical and beautiful album."
2,okay,"kiss is a classic anotherloverholenyohead,girls&boys,and mountains are good songs but that's the best that i can say about this disc.the rest is filler and second rate material."
4,I forgot how great it was!,"I recently purchased this CD as part of the gradual conversion of all my old Prince stuff from LP, and I've fallen in love with it all over again. There is no one who writes songs as completely as Prince. Everything is orchestrated to lush perfection -- it's as if you're listening to sequential mini-symphonies.Try listening to it in the car, on a winding country road on a warm summer day. Open the windows and sunroof -- and crank it. It'll be 1986 all over again!"
5,Forget the film....,"Although I think it was a brave attempt by Prince to make a film in that style, it was panned by the critics, and by some Prince fans alike. Forget the film. The CD contains one of his all-time classics ""Kiss"", which even if it were released today, is streets ahead of the usual dross that you get in the charts. Apart from this gem, other highlights include ""Anotherloverholenyohead"" ""Do You Lie"" "" I Wonder You"" and my all time favourite Prince song, and achingly sad, ""Sometimes It Snows In April""Check out his new CD ""The Rainbow Children"" - Prince is back on track with this one."
5,I can't stop listening to this one,20 years ago i was 11 and playing with transformers while this album would play non stop. To this day it still gets haevy rotation minus the toys. I Love it.....
3,Interesting but......,"Although one of the earlier albums I bought, there's not much here that pulls me to the side. ""Girls & Boys"" and ""Anotherloverholenyohead"" are my favorites, but aside from that, everything else here sounds promo, which is not a bad thing. Super soundtrack to listen to after you've just watched the movie, but an o.k. album to listen to on its own."
2,Hits and a LOT of Filler,"There are few songs as wonderful as ""Kiss"" ... certainly none appear on the rest of Parade. AnotherLoverHoleInYoHead comes close with a light Steely Dan approach, and New Position is rubber-band-snappingly good. The rest just seems too nostalgic (Do U Lie?) or mellodramatic (Sometimes It Snows in April). Ain't much foreshadowing of the next album (Sign O the Times), the best of his career!"
3,Not his best...,"Ok, this is not bad, but not as good as Purple Rain,Dirty Mind, Controversy and Sign O' The Times of course.It is at the same level as Around The World In A Day: it hassome classics, but many fillers and it's-an-okay-song-but tracks.Highlights include Kiss, AnotherLoverHoleNYoHead, Mountains and that's all. Boys and Girls is quite poor of instruments and melody, New Position is a better song but 2 short unfortunately, a hit single should had been made from it with much attention. All in all: it's not a bad album (Prince doesn't have bad ones:) but if U want 2 get his best from his earlier years get the ones I mentioned above."
5,LOVE IS A PARADE,"If there is a musician,who can call himself The Artist,then it`s Roger Nelson,the man who opened eyes and ears,which were closed,till the moment when they listened the first time to PRINCE. P.S.:He`l always be PRINCE for me!!!!"
3,Parade!,"I dind't like this album that much. It's very different from the other Prince albums I've listened to. But there are few great tracks on this album such as Kiss, Sometimes it snows in April etc. But this cd lacks something and I don't know what it is. Maybe Prince was to fast making this album. But thanfully a year after this one was released. The magnificant Sign O'The Times was released. Probably one of the best albums of all time.If you wan't to become a Prince Fan you must have this. If you are a fan you must have this already. If you wan't to buy anything with Prince but not nessecerly a fan don't buy this one. Buy Purple Rain, Sign O'The Times, The Gold Experience, 1999 or Dirty Mind"
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I'M ONE OF THE BIGGEST PRINCE OR ARTIST FAN THERE IS .. BUT THIS ALBUM WAS LIKE A SLAP IN THE FACE .. IT SEEMS AFTER PURPLE RAIN HE HAS RELEASE A LOT OF GARBAGE.. BEFORE HE'S TRULY BEST ALBUMS IN A LONG TIME .. NAMELY SIGN OF THE TIMES, DIAMONDS AND PEARLS AND EMANCIPATION...THERE ARE ONLY A FEW CUTS HERE EVEN WORTH THE TIME TO LISTEN TO KISS, ANOTHERLOVERLIKE A HOLEIN YOUR HEAD, MOUNTAIN .. THE REST IS PURE TRASH.. AS WELL AS THE MOVIE"
5,A paisley-pop masterpiece,"Prince has dissed this record in interviews but that's just him being stupid. It's a sparkling kaleidoscopic gem - the record he *should* have followed up ""Purple Rain"" with. The records got even better, of course - his masterpiece ""Sign O The Times"" was less than a year away. But this was his supremely imaginative farewell to ""pop life"" and it sounds as fresh and fun today as it did 15 years ago."
5,Prince at a creative peak with this music and movie!,"The album doesn't let on to the fact that the movie is a comedy which is cool. Also, the tracks are banded together like ""Sgt. Pepper"" and Prince's other masterpiece ""Lovesexy."" The beauty of this album will show you that the break-up of Prince And The Revolution was a really BIG DEAL in 1986!!"
3,"Skip The Film, Enjoy the Music","An odd mix of mini-songs and actual songs, this album remains my brother's favorite Prince item, but it doesn't do so with me. Not that there aren't good tracks here - ""Kiss"", ""Mountains"" and ""Anotherloverholenyohead"" (spellcheck THAT!) are great numbers. But some of the other items (""Do U Lie?"", ""Life Could Be So Nice"") are mildly interesting if that. Good enough to keep me buying his stuff, but not enough to make me play it over and over. And hey, Amazon, how 'bout rotating that cover art so he doesn't look like he's hanging out a window or something?"
1,It is a joke,The quality of this DVD is not good at all. I ordered another one from another source and it is much better quality.
2,Upright Spoon Rest,"It is really not practical, especially when you are cooking on all four burners of your stove since there is only one small hole to put your spoons in. If you put it on the stove it be careful, because it gets hot by the vent on the oven."
5,Dry skin combatant,"I have a real problem with my nose peeling and the surrounding skin flaking. Many cremes work for a short while and then it's like my body builds up a defense against them (pretty backwards!LOL)This creme works for me, smells fine (not strong), absorbs well, not greasy."
5,Good tip,"this is a well constructed tip and tripple 000 means just that. It is tiny, nice for small writing, or itty bitty dots."
3,Good OST but BOOTLEG!,"The Outlaw Star Soundtrack is great. However it has been out of print for 5+ years. So if you are looking for it, you will likely buy an illegal bootleg copy of the disc. BE CAREFUL."
5,This is the most beautiful bible I have ever seen,"Wow ... the ancient biblical times come alive with color photographs, illustrations, encyclopedia-like references, and simple to read English for anyone interested in Christianity. Even an atheist or an agnostic who wants an academic and anthropological view of Judeo-Christian theology would find this an excellent learning guide.The Bible has been translated and edited and politics has influenced it. I won't deny that nor will I refute that when the Christians aligned with the Roman empire there wasn't another influence in theology. But if you can get past all that ... and all the revisions in the Council of Nicea ... what we do have is a portal into a world whose wisdom remains valid in modern times.Besides ... this is akin to an adult picture book bible story group and the stories come alive."
3,Get the NIV Learning Bible Instead!,"I only give this edition 3 stars because it is the CEV. Now, the CEV might be good for children or those with a very limited English-language education, but the CEV is a very watered-down version of the real Bible. If you get this Learning Bible in the NIV - well, then your ticking right on time! I give the NIV Learning Bible 5 stars! So get this Learning Bible in the NIV! Yes, it's big and heavy, but it must be like that with all those many beautiful color photographs and artworks from around the world throughout! The Learning Bible also has many helful informative articles and notes on every page. Very nice! Wish they made a genuine leather version. The other best study Bible is the NKJV (or NIV) of the Life Application Bible - oh yes!"
4,White Knights,"I bought the white leather chucks as a gift. To begin with, the leather is creamy and bleach white. The only problem is that since they look so nice, you almost don't want to wear them often."
4,Leather Chucks are cool,"The shoes are great for casual dress where you would normally need a pair of black shoes. They look sharp. They are well made and as comfortable as any other chuck shoe. They breathe well through the vents. All in all a good buy.An important note, they seem to run a bit large. I wear an 11 in mens, they arrived at about 11 1/2, and now as they are breaking in they are about an 11 3/4- 12. I've read others saying the same thing. Buy a half size smaller than you would usually wear.But still a cool shoe."
5,Great shoes!,These shoes are comfortable and stylish (in an odd sort of way) and this is a dang good price.
4,Gimme a bottle of anything and a glazed donut...TO GO!!!!,"Remember the beginning of the music vid for Yankee Rose? Yeah...takin u back, eh?turn back the clock to November 14 1986, DLR sold out two shows at the Hollywood Sportatorium. It was my second concert ever attended (don't recall whether i went to the first show on November 14 or the 2nd show at the same venue on the 15th) Anyway DLR's band, imo, was BETTER that his old Van Halen cronies: Steve Vai on guitar, Greg Bissonette on the drums, and the great Billy Sheehan on the bass. Most of the album has dated well for what it is. Good songs are : Goin Crazy, Shy Boy, Ladies Night In Buffalo, Big Trouble, i even like Roth's Sinatra cover, That's Life."
3,over the top,i think this personifies the mood and energy:of the times.d.l.r. is the ultimate in-your-face rock star.masking showmanship and bombast to cover for a weak voice and mediocre songs.d.l.r. saves face by hiring great studio musicians to carry the load!
3,As good as Van Halen??? Umm.NO!,"This is a good album by Van Halen's original and current frontman, but to say its as good as anything Van Halen did with Sammy Hagar is absurd. If it was DLR would not have ended up playing in Vegas wheras Van Hagar hit #1 with all 4 of their albums and were the Monsters Of Rock!DLR hires a junior Van Halen here and went after the Classic Van Halen audience while Van Halen moved on musically and made new fans while keeping a bunch of old ones too.This was Daves best solo album but if you want some DLR, grab one of the first 6 Van Halen albums."
4,THERE is a rocker!,"Okay, I'm almost 40, and I'm ready to see some more of the REAL Van Halen before they are all on Social Security. Please, please, please, Eddie, hire Dave again and let all of our dreams come true. We miss him, and this album shows why.I disagree with the idea that this band was an ""upgrade"" from Van Halen. Vai's guitar playing lacks Eddie's personality (not to mention his catchy riffs and chord patterns), and the backing vocals aren't nearly so good as those on VH and VH II. Still, this album definitely beats 5150, its real competition. Why not swallow your pride, you jerk, and restore your band to its best lineup? (I know, we all come see you despite Cherone, but who really likes him?)ACK! GAG! COUGH!"
3,diamond dave,"I enjoy the lively music on this CD. Steve Vai (g) and Billy Sheehan (b) execute some of the tightest rhythms ever recorded by an LA Rock Band. The opening conversation between Dave and Steve is worth the price of admission as Vai actually makes a guitar ""speak"". Vai and Sheehan get a chance to strut their stuff on three of my favourites from this CD, namely, TABACCO ROAD, SHYBOY, and BUMP & GRIND. On SHYBOY, Vai plays classic speed metal, cascading chromatic runs peppered with vibrato notes held to arrest attention. Diamond Dave gets to play his favourite role as Game Show Host on the overwrought I'M EASY, and GOIN' CRAZY sounds like it came from the Van Halen songbook. That's fine by me since Dave co-authored that book. A funky groove is established on LADIE's... and BIG TROUBLE for Dave to do slow soul. If you are interested in some of the tightest rhythm in an LA Rock Band, or in the speed metal sound of the eighties, this CD will interest you."
3,Decent rock album....,"There are some good songs on here such as the hard rockingYankee Rose and Shyboy... But c'mon! You can't be seriouswhen you try and stand this up next to Van Halen's first 6albums. That's just non sense.It's not just about Eddie vs. Dave.... Dave's solo band justdon't have the backing vocals and such to match Van Halen. Thatisn't an insult, but it's pretty close to a fact... If youbelieve this is on the level of any of the band's first 7 albumsyou are truly a David Lee Roth fan way more than a Van Halenfan."
3,The Long Awaited Solo effort by Diamond Dave,"After waiting patiently after the break up, fans finally got treated to the David Lee Roth solo effort. The Van Halen brothers already had their material ready when Dave left the band. All they had to do was find a singer who can come up with some words to the riffs Eddie and Dave already worked on. Dave had to start from scratch with a new band. That is why this record took longer to come out, and explains why, in my opinion, 5150 is a better record than this one. The tour on this record, however, kicked major tail, leaving Van Halen flabbergasted. This record can be called ""cheesy"" by todays standards, but back then, it was rock 'n roll."
4,Great game to teach teamwork!,"I bought this game based on an educational referral. I work with elementary aged students with high functioning autism. We have played only a few times, but they absolutely love this game (all are boys)! It helps them learn how to work together instead of compete, to think about others and not just themselves, they have to communicate with each other as they plan how to get to each room, and they love the intrigue of finding the keys and getting to the safe in time. Some get stressed by the ticking timer. I love that it's a game that we can play start to finish within my 30 min. group period. My only problem is that it is rather difficult to have a successful mission (the guard and the dog tend to mess us up a lot, so I've conveniently ignored them at times). But overall this game is so fun that these kids will ""work"" for it as a reward on Fridays!"
3,"Fun, quick but not much strategy","It is fun to play a game where you have to work together, quickly, to achieve a result. It takes effort the first couple of times to make it work because there is no learning curve, the clock ticks down no matter what. (If you have impatient types in your crowd, this is sure to set them off.) I just wish there was a bit more strategy to it; you have to strategize to figure out when to use certain tools as well as who will try to go where to avoid the guard and the dog. But a roll of the dice and you're toast. The directions are not particularly well-written so read them carefully - if, when you are playing, things don't make sense, reread the directions."
2,Into Motion wasn't for me,"I have three other Salvador albums and enjoy all of them, but this one didn't strike a cord with me. I regifted this cd to someone else. But God bless the boys of Salvador."
5,The Best -(`v')- love it!!!!,"I loved their first CD and was pleasantly surprised that this one is just as great, if not better!!!! I played it for weeks straight and I keep going back to it. Plus, I'm checking for the next one!!!!"
2,Average to below average clock radio,"I could almost give this 3 stars, but not quite.I wanted a red lighted radio because it is not as bright as the green. I was also wanted Radio wake option. The problem I found with this radio is it is hard to get the tuner to stay on the station and the station. So I worried every night ""would the alarm hold the station and wake me or should I turn the annoying alarm sound on?""The buttons cover all the features necessary for most needs, but I would have liked to have had a touch turn off button as apposed to a switch. It is hard to find and work when your just waking up.Good points are it was a good price, there is a backup battery availability, snooze, red lighted."
4,Love Susan....,"I love Susan Tedeschi. If you have nothing else by Susan and like Bonnie Raitt, you will like ""Best of Susan Tedeschi.""On the other hand, all of these songs (except the two live tracks at the end) come from two of her albums - Wait for Me and Just Don't Burn. It's rather curious that the label would put out a ""Best of.."" after only two albums. I sense she changed labels and the old label decided to do a ""Best of.."". I would suggest get the two albums rather than the ""Best of..."", but this album is certainly good for the price of $5.00."
1,other people's stories,What kind of book makes the same points over and over again chapter after chapter? What kind of author borrows other peoples stories (almost entirely) to make points regarding innovation ?
2,The Longest Advertising,"I am reading this book, and I couldn't wait to write an opinion about it. The book remember me ""cast away"" film, I enjoyed it but it's a longest advertising in the history!!!, I am reading the book and I am feeling the same, I read other books about innovation and everything is perfect, this book hasn't any know-how to offer. I had the hope with IDEO, but I have to wait."
1,Waste of time.,"Reading this book is a waste of time. I know, It is tough to explain how someone can do innovating thinking etc. But this book does not help any. Read books on mindmapping instead."
4,Writing for a cross-section of business,"Look, this is a good book. It's a balanced compilation of theoretical and actual business practices, and challenges perceptions of how you might currently run your own team/business. I give it four instead of five stars because it is a bit basic in some of its assumptions -- the theory presented is really how to build from the ground-up. But I believe that to be a result of writing for a broad populace. Yes, there are still CEOs, managers, etc., who covet the corner office and believe that hierarchy is the key to good business practice. If you do buy into that, this book addresses those preconceptions. If you are beyond that, this book will seem a bit ""Innovation: 101."" But still, an interesting read and some great tips. And hey, it never hurts to revisit the basics anyway."
4,Inspirational,"A well-written book that, at times goes a little overboard with the IDEO-praise, motivates everyone to think a little more about innovation and how possible it really is. A great read for anyone considering product design in any industry."
4,"Worthwhile, but redundant...","I count myself as an individual lucky enough to have been given a tour of IDEO's HQ. Through no real merit of my own, more as a product of circumstances. Knowing what the company stands for and how it goes about it's work, I give this book 4-stars. I'm trying to balance the sheer genius behind IDEO with the fact that the book does feel a bit redundant by the end. If I were looking for the perfect analogue, I'd go with how I feel when reading a book by Gladwell. You recognize the brilliance of the concepts, but by the end, you've so absorbed his point, that you realize you're reading more and more examples that reinforce what you've already read before. To that end, this is a fantastic book to start reading, and one you can make your own determination on concluding."
3,Skip it and go right to 10 Faces,"I recently read both this book and the Ten Faces of Innovation. My recomendation is to skip this book. It is written more like an advertisement for IDEO and was left feeling like Tom has crossed the line into arrogance. If you read it as a stand alone book there is a lot of useful information. However most of the concepts are covered in Ten Faces. If you have time read both books but if time is of the essence then jump right into the Ten Faces, you won't be disappointed."
2,Innovation by Management ?,"Book seems to present a wholly ""management"" perspective to the Art of Design Innovation. Unfortunately, the author seems so caught up in his rose tinted view of events that most of the process and effort (read ""real work"") so necessary for successful Product Innovation hardly gets an honest mention. Is it any wonder that lots of people out there relate so well with Scott Adams' long-suffering Dilbert The Engineer cartoon character?"
5,The Art of Innovation: Lessons in Creativity from IDEO,"This book was inspirational to me because of the many examples of executing an idea. Since the examples were varied in application and product fields, it motivated me to review ideas that I have and encouraged me to risk launching some of them into the public waters.I bought this book for a few friends of mine because it contains ignitable information. One young friend just graduated college and the other is a seasoned architect whom has stories of his own."
3,"Good food for thought, but not terribly practical","Ideo is a fascinating company, and just reading about its adventures and ways is enjoyable. Beyond that, this is a great book to give you some creative nudges. Frankly, I think the title and subtitle oversell it. This isn't really some kind of guide that you can apply and become more creative. Not to say that it's not helpful in that way, but only in the most general sense of the word. Still, it is absolutely worth reading and enjoyable because an inside look at Ideo is not to be missed."
5,Innovating the process of Innovation,Full of information about the development of innovative products and services
5,Outstanding!!!!!,"Tom Kelley has written a masterpiece. Anyone who is even thinking about designing - ANYTHING - should study this ""bible."""
2,Dissapointing,"There is just one or two (not new) interesting concepts in this book and on top of it, the author could have captured them all in a few pages only. There was not really a good reason to write a this book except for letting us know how incredible IDEO is.In comparison, ""Ten faces of Innovation"" is much more informative. Both books are easy to read and entertaining, but lack pragmatic advice. If you have to choose one of them, read ""ten faces"" only."
4,Still can't see the man behind the curtain.,"This book moves quickly and is very inspiring. It started me re-thinking some approaches I have to beginning a project and moving through ""stuck"" points. I have poured through it to try and find some great answers to the tough client-management/design-management questions and it leaves me a tad disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it has great insight and has a lot of info that I am currently trying to find a place for in my own style. I just get the feeling that Kelley is, at times, preaching to the choir with a slightly different sermon.I'm using it as a great springboard towards other design management ideas."
2,A (somewhat dated) infomercial for IDEO,"I got to about the halfway point of the audio version and then couldn't get any further.I am impressed with what IDEO has accomplished, and if I were looking for a history of the firm this would be it. As general advice for someone managing innovation, though, it's at best something to skim through for the high points, which could be summarized in two or three pages.Also, many of the suggestions that might have been new in 2001 are ""old hat"" in 2009. That fact may actually be a testament to the success of the firm and its methods, but it does make the book less practical for a reader picking it up today.One thing I did come away curious about was how the firm and its clients have dealt with the economic downturn, which affects us all and which calls for creative solutions to all kinds of problems. Perhaps they will come out with a second edition that includes stories from the crisis period..."
2,Good in Theory,"...but so is Cold Fusion.Kelley and IDEO have a great culture for a start-up that has morphed along with their growth. At 300 pages, there isn't much new that is not coverd in the first third of the book.Though it sounds like a great place to work (IDEO), Kelley doesn't really make the case for how an established entity that has a less inviting culture can overcome their environment and obstacles He suggests how it should be (or could be), but not practicle ways to get from points A to B (though he might say I don't think innovatively enough).As others have mentioned here - IDEO has has some great successes, but much of the book reads like a pat on their own back and a list of all their achievements more than it is a management guide."
3,Fatboy Doggie Bed,"The bed is very well made. The fabric is resistant to liquids and very durable. It's very easy to puff up the bed. Despite all of that my dog hates it. I bought it for my Great Dane/Lab mix who weighs about 125 lbs. When he first sat on it, his front paws slid off the bed. That was it. He was done with it. For large breed dogs, they will slide. The surface is slippery under a lot of weight. I put an old blanket over it and my Australian Shepherd slept on it. He thought it was great but the bed makes a lot of noise. We can't keep it in the bedroom. The stuffing is noisy. All in all is a well made bed with limited use.Fatboy Doggielounge, Large, Orange"
3,"The dog likes it, but not sure if I do.","I really liked the simplicity and design of this item and was excited to find it on Amazon. When I received it though I was surprised at how ""plastickey"" the outer fabric is. It is VERY loud when the dog gets on and off of it. Part of that is due to the outer shell and part is due to the noise that the stuffing makes. Speaking of the stuffing, it is not at all like a memory foam product, so I have to constantly re-fluff it so the dog will get back into it. Otherwise, it gets a big divot in it and the dog is basically laying on the floor. I'm trying to figure out a solution to the design flaw. Might have to change out the stuffing for something better."
1,Fatboys are Rubbish - Discuss!!,"I bought my 7 week old labrador puppy a Fatboy Doggie Louunge and it looked great when i took it out of the box. After three hours it didn't look so good with polystyrene balls all over the floor, the puppy had ripped through both the outer shell and the mattress!The warranty says sharp objects may rip it in a 'Zorro' way, not sure a cuddly 7 week old puppy has anything sharp about it!As a fashion accessory they look great. As a practical hard wearing dog bed they're a waste of money and totally rubbish!By the way i have just noticed the Fatboy Hammock I bought in the summer is starting to fade and teh frame is going rusty - not great products at all really!!"
1,Avoid at all costs!,"I mostly used the CD-ROM, which was full of errors. It scored things incorrectly, and some questions had the wrong answer as correct- really, really obvious things, such as saying that marbles are a good toy for an 8-month-old baby, or that a bicarb level of 116 is low! It was poorly formatted and just overall a horrible experience. I wasted my money."
5,Good product,I think the book is good and has thorough questions that will help me study better for the NCLEX!
4,from the book cover,"This volume contains two major manuscript notebooks of Jonathan Edwards-""Natural Philosophy"" and ""The Mind""-as well as a number of shorter manuscript writings connected with his scientific intersects and philosophical development. Several of the shorter papers have not previously been published, notably Edwards' letter on the ""flying"" spider (hitherto known only in a draft version), an essay on light rays, and a brief but important set of philosophical notes written near the end of his life. Wherever possible the works have been newly transcribed from the manuscript originals. The editor has collected, edited, and presented them here in a thoroughly authentic and readable text."
3,Realism and Heroism,"It is admittedly hard to take real-life roles and create heroic situations, even in cases where the greatest heroism derives from the most mundane.So, here's a detective story based on the Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Health Organizations.Not the Impossible Missions Force.Not the Green Berets.Not the CIA or FBI or even the DIA.Not even anything any normal person has ever heard of.Can this sustain interest? Offhand, I'd suspect not. However, this book is well-written and has a lot of local color to offset the unknown and unknowable nature of its heroic framework."
5,8mm Fujifilm Videocassette,"In this day and age a very hard to find product, because manufacture has discontinued it. Fujifilm shipped all brand new with unopened packing. Usage of product is good, would buy again and recommend to others."
5,The Bay Boy,"I love this movie! It's Kiefer Sutherland's first movie, and it's absolutely delightful. It's a coming-of-age film that is very well done. The relationships in the film are rich and carefully drawn. Liv Ullman is wonderful in the role of the boy's Mother. All of the roles are very well acted. The film won six Genies, including best film, the year it was produced. I have watched the film many times and shared it with several friends, who all loved it, too."
1,THERE ARE MUCH BETTER BOOKS!,This book is not an attention getter by any means. Poorly written and singular in substance. At this point the information is mostly out dated. There are some interesting mechanical concepts shown but a free web search into bipeds will reveal the same....
1,Doesn't live up to the hype..,"I guess if you enjoyed The Scarletti Curse, then you'll love this one. Another Italian setting (and I'm Italian), another curse to be broken before true love prevails.I really enjoy Ms. Feehan's contemporary Dark Series, and I thought Id give this a try. I just couldn't get into the story even though Beauty and the Beast is one my all time favorite fairy tales. It really wasnt worth my time or money."
4,A Good Book!,"I really liked this book. It started out a little slow, but it was worth the wait.Also recommended: Angel Lover by Cynthia Cody"
1,Disappointed,"I loved the Drake Sister's series and was looking for more in the author's other works. Lair of the Lion has what could have been an interesting plot and story line. This book might have been so much more. The prose is just awful and makes a potentially great story into drivel. The dialogue alone is over the top sappy, beyond romantic fantasy and destroys any believability of the characters. The character's personalities are fragmented and disjointed to where they don't seem real. The hero's eyes ""blazed"" on almost every page. No one, absolutely no one, says the things she has them say. I was very disappointed and her editor did her no favors sending this to print without major revision. I really did like the plot and wish this could be rewritten to make this a better book."
3,Worth Reading,"It wasn't your typical Beauty and the Beast story but it'll do. There was lots of evil magic, some death, intrigue, jealousy and love. I liked it however, I found myself jumping over lots of it to be able to get to the dialogue it was just to much empty detail for me to be bothered reading. Maybe you'll be more patient. All in all for a free book I liked it. Enjoy"
2,Not what I expected,"I'm a bit disappointed in Christine's book ""Lair of the Lion"". How many accidents can one person endure? The curse? What era did this book take place? Secret passages, lions, spirits? The content was boring. However, Christine does a great job in description of the Don DeMarco. This book did nothing for me. I must admit, Christine should stick with the Vampire stories. She's great at that."
1,Not Good,"First off, let me start by saying that I had read an excerpt from this book a few months before it was actually released. The beginning seemed so good that I pre-ordered the book and checked my mail box every day eagerly awaiting its arrival. However, when the book finally arrived I was left wishing I could send it back. The first parts of the book started off so well, but after that everything just diminished. I give the book one star because the sex scenes did indeed sizzle, but this book is a definite testimony that great sex scenes don't make the book.The plot was extremely weak. This whole re-write thing of beauty and the beast was tired and boring. Secondly, the curse left a lot to be desired. The constant peril of the heroine became silly by 6 chapter. The hero seemed whiny and tiresome. Overall, the book was boring.... It took me nearly 3 weeks to finally finish the book."
1,The worst Feehan book Ever!,"I am a big Feehan fan, however this book was just bad. I forced myself to read past the first few chapters and it just got worse. It was juvenile at best and did not showcase her truly wonderful writing."
2,Disappointing,"I have bought almost all of Christine Feehan's book, and she's usually right on the money with mixing horror and romance. However, this was just a bad idea from the start. Similar to The Scarletti Curse (another disappointing endeavour), we have a male character who lives in a castle somewhere, and who has an ancient curse that makes everyone hate him. But, then his curse turns out to be something just silly. Lions in the winter in Italy?And, why is it that this curse is so bad? He can turn into a lion. In most books, that would be considered a superpower, not a curse.And, finally, the climax of the book (the breaking of the curse) left me cold. It actually made me giggle when I imagined it.Stick to vamps, Christine. That's where your true talent lies."
1,One of my least favorite Christine Feehan novels,"I was disappointed with this book, and as soon as I finished it, sold it on Ebay. I rated it 3 stars only because it's a Christine Feehan novel, and it was good as a suspense novel, but terrible as a romance novel."
5,Highly Recommended!,"I've really enjoyed Christine Feehan's Dark series. After reading the write ups on The Lion of Leon, I was essentially expecting the retelling of Beauty and the Beast but this book was much, much more. I stayed up until 2:30 am to finish it because I couldn't put it down. This one is Christinee Feehan at her best and is definately a keeper."
3,Lair of the Lion,"I did not enjoy it nearly as much as the ""Dark"" Series. I thought the hero in the Lair of the Lion a rather whiney tiresome fellow."
5,Christine Does it Again,"After reading all the current works of Ms. Feehan; I am blow away yet again by the power and passion of her work. For those that loved the ""Beauty and the Beast"" story as children; you will love the adult twist that Ms. Feehan has created in this one of a kind book. I look forward to your next Creation Christine~!"
2,I Couldn't Finished It.,"I absolutely love Ms. Feehan's Dark Series, and that's why I bought this one. But I just couldn't finish it. Maybe I'll change the rating later...if I ever pick it up again and can finish it, but it's one of the few I had to put down after a while. It didn't hold my interest long enough."
3,"A rewritten ""Beauty and the Beast"", essentially.","Interesting, but merely a somewhat different take on an old storyline. Toss in a few Italian phrases, a few screaming phantoms, a hero that broods more than David Boreanaz, and voila - Lair of the Lion. I was expecting Carpathians, and this is not in the same line as that series. It was a nice read, but in the end seemed more fluff than substance. I can appreciate the time and effort put into making this book, and it wasdefinitely a pretty good afternoon read."
2,Monotonous,"Engaging characters and great descriptions, but the plot was monotonous and very repetitive. Every chapter revolved around the same scenario. Heroine is stalked by something/someone, heroine ""feels"" an evil presence, heroine is injured/terrorized/trapped in some fashion, hero rushes to the rescue and saves the day.Taken individually each chapter is great, but when the same thing happens over and over again it just gets boring..."
1,Too silly! A real wallbanger.,"I am a BIG fan of the ""Dark"" books, but this so-called ""Gothic"" cannot compare. It takes more than just putting a woman in a long gown and throwing in four or five Italian words to create a sense of time or place.Lacking a believable world, the characters range from silly to frankly fantastical. There is no tension or suspense or mystery.A BIG disappointment."
2,Disappointing!!,"After the fantastic Carpathian 'Dark' series, I anxiously awaited this newest book, The Lair of the Lion. I was disappointed, to be truthful. It's Beauty & the Beast all over again with some Italian words and phrases thrown in to confuse you. Instead of her father, Beauty has to save her brother. While the Carpathian stories made you believe there could actually be some of these people in existence, I didn't believe in the people in this story, and what's worse, I didn't really care about them and their problems. Sorry, Ms. Feehan, the book really wasn't worth waiting for. Please go back to Byron and Dayan and give us their stories."
1,"Yawn,,,,,","Boring, same plot line as every other book in this series. Save your money and don't waste your time."
3,"OK, but not great","I am a fan of the ""Dark"" Series and have read the Scarletti Curse. This book is similar to the Scarletti Curse. It's almost like she went back and rewrote it with more sex and changed the plot enough to have a different book. The mysteropis lions and supernatural evil being didn't work for me, but she did a better job of character development in this book than the Scarletti Curse. Overall worth reading, but had some big holes in the plot."
5,FANtastic,"I really enjoyed this book. It reminded me of the Scarlotti Curse. The ""romantic"" scenes were wonderfully written and you will constantly guess at who is causing the accidents. The only books from Christene Feehan that I dislike are short ones. You can never get enough of her characters. If you like a good romance buy this one."
3,Lair of the Lion,This is not Feehan's best. I have read all of her books. The first vampire books were hot hot sexually. This is more like the Scarletti book she wrote and reads about the same. I'm giving it three stars because Feehan is an excellent author. But her first five books were outstanding and maybe she cannot top them.
5,I read anything written by Christine Feehan...she is my favorite author,Nothing that Christine Feehan has written so far has disappointed...I recommend her to everyone of my friends...I will get all her books
5,lair of the lion,Loved the book I have actually read it more then once now. Christine Feehan is my favorite author of all times.
5,"A quick, inexpensive guide that covers all the bases","I actually purchased this guide a few years back, and it is very good investment for the beginning comic artist. It is not a method drawing book...it doesn't really teach you a particular style of drawing, but instead focuses on the different elements of comic art that come in handy regardless of the specific details of your drawing style. There are chapters devoted to the layout of a comic page, one dealing with panels and words, one with camera angles and composition, and the all-important chapter on character design and anatomy. There's also a quick, full-color comic in the middle of the book that helps to illustrate many of the concepts. All in all, a great reference book for the first-time comic artist."
1,Not for us:( seam rubs,"The seam on these rubbed terribly, so they went in the trash right away. The neoprene seemed like a good idea, but it did not work. They also were slippery under bar grips."
1,Doesn't work. Computer can't read.,"It didn't work at all. My device manager said to replace it or try to install a driver, which I couldn't locate anywhere on the internet. I am not paying POSTAGE and restock on it to return. Will stick to PALM products only now."
4,Good alternative to a tree stand,"This is a good blind for hunting if you can't hunt in a tree stand or need to be closer to the ground in order to get a shot. It sets up easy and fast and blends in pretty well. Take-down can be a litle confusing and it usually takes me a couple of tries to get it to pack down correctly to fit in the backpack. The backpack is a good feature and makes it really easy to carry. One thing I did not like is the ""shoot through"" mesh. This is misleading because on the inside of the blind it clearly states that you should not shoot a firearm or mechanical broadhead through the mesh, so basically you can use a broadhead arrow. I don't use this blind for bow hunting, so that was a big disappointment. The mesh does work really well for concealment though and I am thinking about ordering the optional Total Scent Control for this blind. Amazon had the best price with shipping."
4,Easy to set up,"Product practically sets itself up after pulling it out of its included backpack. material seems flimsy but stood up to a five day hunt and rain storm. I remained dry, protected and invisible. Turkey hens walked right by me without seeming to notice this blind. I knocked it down a star because it is difficult to fold back up and fit into its backpack. Included instructions dont tell how to fold it up. Seek youtube video for takedown instructions. This is a great value for the money."
5,Great for scent control and warmth,"I've purchased 3 of these blinds and absolutely love them. Keeps the wind and rain off of you and really helps control your scent being released. I've hunted from tree stands, etc. but these ground blinds have proved to be my best locations to hunt from. You can relocate them easily from year to year; unlike a lean-to or ladder stand. If you never popped one of these things opened before make sure to read the instructions carefully; it's a little hard to understand initially but once you've done it, you'll never have any problem. Practice putting it up and taking it down in the back yard before going to the hunt site."
1,Does not hold up like it says.,"We bought this 2 months ago, and as you know with a blind, you keep it up during the hunting season. By the end of the season, there were holes on the top, the 2 strings that hold the poles on the top up broke, and the anchor loops broke. Should have held up more than 1 hunting season. Live & learn."
2,Chest came off right out of the box,I don't see this lasting long besides as a display pieces. Was posing him just for display and chest piece came right off. I will now have to glue him back together.
5,it is equal to a god,Dont even open the box!keep it closed and admire the buety and detall of this alien masterpiece
5,Manuel Romero The Greatest New Latin Voice,"I ordered this CD after I heard him on the radio. When I received it I was very surprised that the big voice I heard on the radio, came out of a 13 year old boy!! This is a MUST have for anyone into great Latin music."
4,Superb,"Evidently a CD ""far from the madding crowd""... a cut above the rest, both in richness and maturity. Sound engineers could do a little more to enhance quality though."
5,he is FANtastic!,"I saw Manuel in ""The Buddy Holly Story"" in San Jose. I thought he was older than 14! He can sing the pants off of anyone! I went to a 49ers game last month and I was hoping he would be singing the national anthem (he didn't...). He is an amazing young man with a great voice and I am glad I had the opportunity to see him!"
5,So Good I Bought Two!,"This knife is the perfect size for your pocket and because it's guaranteed never to rust, go ahead and take it with you next time you hit the salt!"
5,Mastering your ADHD is more than taking medicine,"After many years of ups and downs in my life, I was diagnosed with adult ADHD. Maybe it was the mess around me, or the 30 or 40 unfinished jobs in my basement. I took the Foclin, but the mess still remained. What I needed to do was to retrain myself. This book proved to be very useful in the retraining process for me. I recommend it highly. Folks like me with ADHD really need to learn skills to deal with our natures more so than relying on a chemical cure(s) with drugs. You can't take stimulants forever, sooner or later they poop out on you and no longer work."
1,overpriced and not much help,If you know nothing about ADHD you may learn a few things here but I would describe this book as 2 or 3 pages worth of helpful information crammed into an expensive 130-page manual. Save your money and read Driven to Distraction or other works.
1,Broke Before Anyone Could Wear It,This crown broke before anyone could even wear it. It arrives flat and you have to connect the ends. I guess the plastic was too brittle and in broke into 2 pieces.
3,Little More Than an Appetizer,"It's really disappointing to see one of the oldest and best reissue labels like Rhino follow in the footsteps of MCA and start its own version of the abysmal 20th Century Masters series. Rhino's Essentials series offers nothing for the serious music fan. [It could be argued that the casual fan will not find anything to get excited about here either.]Just last year Rhino released the excellent single-disc Mascara and Monsters. What Essentials does is pare down that album's 22 tracks to 12. And don't let the CD cover photo fool you. Only seven of these tracks are by Alice Cooper the band; the last five tracks are solo numbers. And what constitutes ""essential""? Alice Cooper as a band and as a solo act had eleven Top 40 hits. Only eight of them are here. [Missing: ""Hello Hurray,"" ""Clones (We're All)"" and ""Poison.""]Sure, this is a few bucks cheaper than Mascara and Monsters. But if you are any kind of Alice Cooper fan, Essentials is little more than an appetizer."
2,Essential? NOT!,"This CD was obslolete on the day of its release. The far superior ""The Best Of Alice Cooper: Mascara And Monsters"" boasts 10 more songs and a better CD booklet, at a mere few extra bucks. Even the original ""Alice Cooper's Greatest Hits"" has a better track selection, if only because it's comprised of the original Cooper Band's material and leaves out the sappy solo ballads.There are plenty of AC collections on the market. Start with either of the two mentioned above, or even B$B. I give it two stars becuase every song is incredible, but otherwise this is a very non-essential ""Essentials."""
3,pros and cons,"pros:1. has some useful direct keys to start frequently used programs. I wish those keys were programmable, though.2. I love the volume control on the key board3. the sleep key is very useful, and I'm glad there's NO power off key so I don't have to worry that I might turn off the computer by accident.cons:1. weird ""home, end, pageup, pagedown, delete"" keys layout. need some time to get used to it, and then you need more time to get used to switching between this one and other keyboards in other places you work2. key ""6"" is located for left hand, not right hand.3. have to press F-lock to activate function keys. for programmers function keys are more useful than those email keys.overall, it's a good one for general document processing, but not for programming."
4,Great Except for F-Lock,"I like this keyboard alot, i've been using it for a few months and I havn't had any problems so far. The F-Lock is a REAL annoyance though. I play online games and I like to take screenshots, sadly if I want to use the Print Screen key then I must turn F-Lock off, which means a whole lot of clicking the F-Lock on and off... You do get used to it though. They keyboard shortcuts are GREAT! I never used to use the Windows Calculator, I do all the time now because I can reach it with the click of a button.Oh yeah, and you hands never get tired! I'm on the computer 3-5Hours a day, and I never end up with tired fingers!"
3,"Good Keyboard, but the","Overall, I think this is a decent keyboard. The ""natural"" keys are positioned in a comfortable ergonomic location. There are many buttons that you can override with applications, or leave the default programs.However, my main complaint is that the ""6"" key is on the wrong side of the ergonomic keyboard. It is on the left side. If you touch type, you may struggle with this like I do.Another concern is that the ""INS"" key has been moved. This is also an adjustment for me. They have extended the ""DEL"" key to cover the ""INS"" position, and moved the ""INS"" function as part of ""PRTSCRN"" with the help of using an added key--function lock (or ""F LOCK"").(...). I would still probably purchased it knowing the ""6"" key problem because of the low price. However, after seeing how much better I can type on an ergonomic keyboard, I plan to start looking for another keyboard that will have the ""6"" in the right place."
3,Decent keyboard for the price,This keyboard was a bit awkward to use due to its shape and was very bulky. It was fine for a backup keyboard but is not something I would use daily due to the size of the keyboard.
1,piece of crap,"Bad feel, function keys are off by default, hard plastic wrist wrest, and it has the microsoft name on it."
2,Turns into a pill-y monster,"After a half dozen washes, the sheets have become pilled, abrasive and stiff. Sure, the price is decent, but it feels like sleeping on a sheet of steel wool."
3,Cozy Sheets,"These queen-size flannel sheets stood up well in the wash, i.e., the fitted sheet did not shrink, but I found that the flat sheet is very narrow and hardly allows for much of a hang-down. This is a problem I find often in sheet sets, and I wish manufacturers would make the flat sheet wider."
2,Quality not what I expected,The color/pattern was pleasing but the quality of the sheets what not what I expected. The sheets were very thin (could see right through them). I have purchased flannel sheets of much higher quality for a similar price at local retailers. Not likely to purchase this type of product from Amazon again.
4,spunkdefied,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I also saw a performance in Cleveland, OH. The book is so jazzy you really can feel each characters emotions. I loved the ""Gilded Six Bits"" part. It's a toe-tappin',finger-snappin',belly-shakin',buttocks movin' kinda book! You will enjoy it!"
2,Holly and Jer are not Romeo and Juliet,"This books was so leaden, the character's were so leaden and like the lead characters romance was a bore-what they spend like a total amount of like two pages making google eyes from across the room and thinking, whoa what a hottie and then bam! their in love!If they had spent more time together maybe I would have got it but their together like a total of 5 pages or something. I mean actually talking not just staring at eachother like moony eyed stuffed animals. If you want an interesting novel try L.J. Smith's Forbidden Game triliogy or Cate Tieran's Sweep series."
1,A major disappointment,"I hated this book so much that I returned it and its two sequels to the store where I bought them! After the wonderful experience of reading ""Sweep"", this was just too disappointing. The book read like an outline. No emotional bond between the characters. Huge gaps in the time line. When the authors tell you ""three months passed"" and also ""six weeks later"", with no clue as to what had happened in the meantime, the plot is in big trouble. The authors fleshed out the villains in more detail than the heroes! I wanted to read more about the heroines, get inside their heads and see what they were thinking, get to know them---but none of that was there. And, hey, the couple that was destined to be together?....wasn't. What's that all about??? I've read lots of Nancy Holder's stuff and it has always been good until now----perhaps her publisher slapped her name on this book without her writing a word of it???Meanwhile, I'll be awaiting the next ""Sweep"" title."
5,It's a series of tubes,"Thanks to this awesome wrench, I learned that the stuff beneath my bathroom sink is really a series of tubes! What will science think of next?"
1,Transformed Light,"I was not disappointed, as I was looking for""another"" group that could be causing all of the worldproblems.The book made reference to ""light"" as this is what theMasons receive during their instruction, or how the""secrets"" are passed on. In this book as his other booksMr. Epperson seems to be ""The Unseen Hand"" trying tomanipulate ""The New World Order"" by ""Transforming theLight of Truth"" so that it only illuminates the subject as hesees it. This is his right, as guaranteed by the Declaration ofIndependence and later the Constitution of this good old USA. Which, Ibelieve may have had a few of those ""Masons"" help draft andsign those documents.If your looking for a New or Fresh prospective, or""Conspiracy"", pass this one by. If you want to be reassuredor convinced that ""They"" (Masons)or someone is out to getYOU, then you must read this book."
2,Simply Confusing,"Mr. Epperson's book, ""Masonry; Conspiracy Against Christianity"", is informative but lacks such congruity that it greatly distracted me from the real message of the book. It would seem that Mr. Epperson took his journal notes and hodgepodged them into a book. He does present material that leads the reader to believe that Free-Masonry is not entirely about old men doing charitable acts and marching in parades. But, it seems that many of his arguments are reaching and almost vindictive. Kudos to Mr. Epperson in his attempt to expose one more secret society that is out to GET US ALL but there is better work out there."
1,Distorted Views,The book is another fine example of paranoia running amuck. The author needs to do his research better and not ad-lib or make assumptions concerning a thought of someone passed away that cannot defend themselves or verify the author's understanding of what the other person wrote. (...)
1,Complete Nonsense,I can't believe I actually read this garbage. Conspiracy theory jiberish. Don't waste your time with this foolish book.
4,Pleasure to read,"The Masonic lodge has a secret agenda...(subtitle). This book was a pleasure to read. Mr. Epperson writes in a clear and concise manner almost as if he is speaking with you directly. In this book he reviews the writings of Albert Pike and other Masonic writers to reveal the ""hidden agenda"" that is contained within. According to the masons, if you really want to know the ""secret"" all you have to do is look for it. That is what this book is all about, finding the hidden meanings in the Masonic writings and rituals. I didn't always agree with Mr. Epperson's interpretations of the writings but it was interesting to read nevertheless."
2,"After a slow start, the book fades slowly away.","I am a real fan of Masonic Conspiracies so I was looking forward to digging up some new stuff to entertain the crowd over tea. Unfortunately, this book let me down. The ""New World Order"" was a 1940's invention of Orwell of 'Animal Farm' fame. While 'Animal Farm' stands as an ironic political satire, readers of 'New World Order' are just too slow to catch the pun. This book falls into the 'New World Order' mold. It repeats the same old Pike, Hall, etc., while failing to digest any of the source material whatsoever. Sad. I would suggest starting with Manley P. Hall's excellent work, especially that done in the 1920's as Fundimentalism was sprouting from the fear of Modernism and the bringing of Darwin into the classroom. Lest we forget, that thing that goes thump in the night is just sewer gas respirating through the plumbing."
4,Unique observations of life as an undocumented worker,"This is one of a handful of books recently written where the author joins a group of undocumented workers crossing the border in attempt to gain employment in the United States. The interesting twist here is that the author, though apparently fluent in Spanish, is white. He also attempts to work in the fields himself, as opposed to simply observing and writing about the work of others. This leads to a number of unique experiences and observations on race relations that are rarely discussed in this context. It also allows the reader to better understand what life is like for many undocumented workers in this country. Kudos to Ted Conover for making a sincere effort to better understand the lives of those that would not otherwise be recorded."
5,Fantastic work,"I am a bilingual teacher living and working among recent immigrants to the US, and I found this book very enlightening and well written. This book spoke directly to my heart."
4,"Entertaining, funny, and thought provoking","Ted Conover does a great job of getting himself on the inside of a world rarely seen by blue eyes. His dedication to his task is commendable. His humor and willingness to work, travel and live like his subjects earns him their respect and mine.Through it all he allows the story to tell itself, without belaboring the political, social and economic issues. These points become self-evident as the stories and characters unfold in this entertaining and thought-provoking book."
5,An often unseen vantage point,"This is an important book, particularly in today's charged political climate. It is very easy to deal in absolutes when one deals with abstract ideas, but what Conover does well, is to humanize those ideas. While many speak of illegal imigration, Conover speaks of specific imigrants. He shares their perspectives,not condemning them, not glorifying them, but merely letting them tell their stories.Aditionally Conover is remarkable for the amount of energy he put into getting to know his subject. Half of the worth of the book is the story of the migrants, the other half certainly is Conover's own story."
3,It's alright,"For a paperback book it took a lot longer to ship than usual. I ordered it and a week later is when they packaged it up and shipped it. So, I didn't get it for about 2 weeks after I ordered it. The book is good and gives good insight on illegal immigration."
4,Wonderful little gadget!,"My boss one for each of us to go with our new phone system, and I couldn't be happier with it! The little mic just clips to your shirt, and I haven't gotten a single complaint from anyone calling in. The earpiece is comfortable, even to the point that I don't notice I'm wearing it! If I had to pick one con, it would have to be that the cord is rather short. But I'm still online, buying another one!"
2,There is always room for Jello,"Dead Kennedys: The Early Years Live: 4 out of 10: Ah the classics... Well this very short video (30 minutes) shows, what one assumes was amateur video, of The Dead Kennedy's tour in support of their first album. It also has a human-interest news report on lead singer Jello Biafra's run for mayor of San Francisco.The video quality is unsurprisingly awful. The sound quality however is even worse which makes this useless as a concert tape. Since the camera stays focused on Jello and the boys one does not even get the interesting thrill of seeing the punk rock audience, which is often the best part of the show. Outside of a few clips of Jello vacuuming a sidewalk (don't ask) there is virtually nothing intelligible in the entire program. Which I guess is kind of punk in its own way after all."
4,good lessons - easy to read,I am an entrpreneur who really liked the lessons brought forth in Jeff's book. I suggest it to anyone who needs inspiration in the daily struggles of running a business.
4,"excellent, real, and helpful","""Lessons"" has great, real-life stories - not a lot of theory or platitudes, just the brutal, sometimes painful truth. Well worth reading by any entrepreneur or potential entrepreneur."
1,Disappointing.,"I didn't find myself engaged in this work. Perhaps if I had a better grasp on Canadian history, I would have found it more engrossing. It was good enough to finish, but not good enough to enjoy finishing."
5,Riveting story - interesting psychological journey,"I began reading this book hearing about how difficult it would be. In fact, I had difficulty getting into the first few pages. After going this far, however, I could not put this book down. When you consider the setting for this novel -- a young Quebec separatist in a Montreal psychiatric prison -- the parallels between the character's tale and the character's real-life peril are obvious. This novel provides fantastic insight into the desperation felt during the ""Quiet Revolution"" of the 1960's."
3,OK basic information,"After reading this book, I was a little dissapointed. It is more of a backgound of the job of a paralegal than anyhting else. If you want to know who, what, and how much you make as a paralegal if you are considering it as a job, then I would suggest this book. However, if you want case research, then I would not recomend ths book. One good thing is it is written an english, not legal trems."
3,Works great but too noisy,"The drive is wonderfully large, fast, and so far, very reliable. However, it can, at times, be extremely noisy as it seeks and writes. Despite being placed in an insulated enclosure, I can hear it working in the next room. I am using it as an external DVR drive and thus the noise is often irritating."
4,"Decent drive, decent price","Pretty easy to install, reasonably quiet, works fine. Not sure what more you can ask for from a hard drive apart from reliability, and it hasn't failed yet."
2,Good for 1 year,Worked fine fro one year then it froze up needed a spanking then it worked for a while I've got to order the same one to fit in my raid (Granite) not very happy with the reliability
4,Very informative,"I found this book to be quite informative and well written. The one small complaint I have about ""Vital Dust"" is its sparse use of diagrams and illustrations, hence the 4 star rating rather than 5. Otherwise, I found this book to be excellent. I am a research life scientist, so had little trouble with Dr de Duve's explanations, but feel the work would be more accessible to the general reader with more illustrations. This is such an interesting book, that I would hate for someone to be ""put off"" of it because of technical language."
2,not so hot,"Skip the Marley collection and get the Bossa Stones cd instead. Great renditions of Stones tunes in Bossa Nova style. The Stones songs really come off well in this style since it is so different from the original style. This is in contrast to the Bossa Marley songs which are not so diff from the original downbeat reggae style, so I suggest avoiding the Marley collection. Just stick with the Stones!"
3,Interesting Spin,"An interesting spin on Marley, but hard to match the original.Still a fun laidback listen... Sorta a funk mellow Bossa."
4,An Eye Opener for Every Israeli,The Last Days of Israel open the eyes of every Israeli who thinks that The Season is something to learn at high school and completely forget about it. Living in a collectivist society has its toll. Some people are still paying it.
2,A flawed polemic,"The Epilouge says enough in its title ""Its your last chance Stupid Jews'. This book is not worth the paper its written on, it is pure extremist angry polemics, without a thesis or a cohesive argument between its paltry number of pages. The main just of this book is to flush out the 'conspiracy' of Rabins assasination. The trouble is that their was no conspiracy and the reasons for the assasination and the details of it are pretty much clear. The book has become a major revisionist text even though it has little scholarly merit and contains little factual ideas, most of it is jurnalistic heresay.Seth J. Frantzman"
3,fascinating but disjointed,"Mr. Chamish's book is worth the price if you are interested in these topics. However, while his writing is fluid and intelligent, he (at least in this book) tends to skip from topic to topic, quotes extensively from the media, has the irritating habit of using four exclamation points or question marks in a row for emphasis (???? !!!!), and he makes references like ""yesterday,"" or ""two weeks ago,"" without making it clear what ""today"" is (so you have to guess what date he's talking about). While he attempts to indict the CFR as the brain behind the machinations he describes, he never explains succinctly why this would be: it either has something to do with an oil pipeline, or wanting the three monotheistic religions to dwell peacefully in Jerusalem under NATO watch. He also presents, in an epilogue, a bizarre diatribe against Palestinians, bizarre in that this is not the topic of the book. One gets the impression this book was written in a hurry."
1,Moronic Bull droppings,"Save your money. Chamish is 100 times stupider and more idiotic than the worst ""911 Truth"" Cult of Conspiracy Nuts"
5,Great mix of hits,I bought this collection to use for my parents' 50th Wedding Anniversary party. They were married in 1955. The collection had a LOT of their favorite old country hits. The guests loved hearing the old tunes and it's made a great gift for my parents!
3,Pretty good,"I'm not really a big fan of compilations. And I don't own this CD, but I like some songs on it. The top 5 (in my opinion, in order) are:1. Youth of the Nation-P.O.D. This song needs no comment.2. What's Luv-Fat Joe. Cool song.3. Wasting My Time-Default. I like this song. Cool hook.4. Wherever You Will Go-The Calling. A bit overplayed, but still good.5. Get The Party Started-Pink. Got too overplayed, but like 4, still kinda good"

5,Works Fine,Worked as advertised.I have a heated floor and have put on 4 wax rings.This one is working well.
5,Good for Wood Floors,"I recently installed this on our toilet that is installed through a wood floor with radiant heat. I found this after twice having a wax seal fail. So far it is working great. I used coleman white gasoline and an comet cleanser to remove the wax from the toilet bowel. The adhesive creates a great seal and the coupling fit well into our 3"" pipe."
1,Caution on vertical drain tightness,"The installer at build placed a cap ring on the vertical pipe, just below the flange outlet, protuding into the 3"" dimension. It was enough to prevent the toilet seal from being pushed into the drain. Looked like a good product - returned to Amazon. Bought a Sani Seal, a foam ring large enough to support the toilet bolts and ease installation. Sani Seal a great alternative to a wax ring."
3,Doesn't seem to fit 4 inch ABS,I purchased this product as part of a complete self-performed bathroom remodel and could not get it to fit my 4 inch black ABS plastic drains. It seems to be just a little too large of the drain opening. I'm very handy and mechanically inclined and loved the waxless concept but I couldn't get these to work in my application. This is not a bad product (thus the three stars) but despite trying dish soap as a lubricant and well-placed cut notches in the outlet fins it wouldn't work for the 4 inch ABS.If you have 4 inch black ABS plastic drains then I recommend the Fluidmaster 7504 Wax Free Bowl Gasket for 4 Inch Drain Pipe. This is what I ended up using and I had zero problems installing my toilets. Six months later I still have no problems.
1,Failed product,"I have replaced many wax seals in my life, but this one seems to be the answer. Easy to install (clean the adhesive area well) and fit perfectly. However time will tell.The seals failed within a month or so after installation. I read and followed each suggestion and recommendation for installation. I am now back to the old fashioned wax seal."
1,Disappointed in this product!,"First, I grant you that the product is a high-quality item in terms of the products materials. However, after three tries at installing I gave up on it and went with a wax seal, like I have used on dozens of installs in the past. The wax seal went on perfect the first time, as always. This products failings are in that it's rigid design does not allows for spacing differences between the floor flange and the toilet bottom, always affected by tile thickness. To use this product you MUST use plastic shims, and then caulk around the toilet base. I was disappointed that this fact was not listed in the product instructions. Not exactly hard but in my view generally unnecessary when using a cheaper wax seal. This product went out with the trash. Save yourself some aggrevation and money and go with the tried and true, cheaper wax seal."
5,Easiest insulation,"Just clean the bottom of your toilet and stick it around the hole.Then line up seal with drain and set it down.Done... :)All I have to say is if you are replacing or fixing a leaking toilet.Use this Seal. There is no better one on the market.If you have heated flooring. I would get this Seal for every toilet you have and get them replaced before the heat from the floor melts your wax. Due to most people put silicone around the base, it may be some time before you realize it is not sealed."
5,Way better then the wax seal,Easy to use and much less messy then the wax seal. If you have a toilet that might rock (perhaps you have a heavy set person using it) this style of seal will not leak or squish out like a wax seal will. My house has a poorly installed toilet flange and this makes it leak proof until I redo the bathroom floor to correct the lazy contractor work.
1,"Worked great for about a year, then started leaking","I was very excited about this product because I hate dealing with wax rings. We installed it in a new bathroom with a new toilet, so there was no wax residue anywhere. The flange was even with the floor which isn't ideal, but should have been fine according to the manufacturer. The seal worked well for a year, then started leaking. I was hoping to have a long term solution, but it ended up being worse than wax. It was worth a try, but failed far too quickly."
5,STOP!!! do not use wax seal!!!,"The fernco waxless seal is the best seal you can use. I have had numerous wax seals fail. The fernco waxless seal will perform exactly as it is supposed too. The only precaution is to check the sticky seal on it at the store before you buy it. Many times people open the box and touch the sticky seal to check it out. They end up compromising the seal by contaminating it and it won't seal well. If you open the box and check to make sure the seal is in good condition, I guarantee you will have excellant results from this product. I am a Professional and all the toilets in my house use this seal."
3,"fascinating commentary, not perfect video","The plus of the disc is the Robert Kerman commentary, while largely not about the film that is playing in tandem with the commentary, Robert though focuses on his career and 1980's porn industry in general. The negative is the transfer of the film to this edition, the print used is largely washed out, colors seemed bleached and the image is flarred (i.e, set too bright) Also, the lack of quality ""money shots"" brings down some of the sex scenes"
1,The only thing good about this movie is its cover.,"Sexy cover, but one of the worst blind movie purchases I've ever made. Just goes to prove you can't judge a book (movie)by its cover.A real stinker."
4,"Overall Good, Snooze Sensor Annoying","For a cheap dual alarm clock, this is perfect. My only complaint is that the Snooze Sensor is hard to get to work when you are just waking up. But, it is quite good for the money."
3,Ritchey rim strips,It took two people and four hands to get the strips on the rim of the bike. There must be a simple way of doing it but none came with the instructions. Next time I will get a roll and cut it to size myself.
5,Not Just For Kids...,"...in the age of Pokemon, the Powerpuffs and Sailor Moon, one can see how this oftentimes tongue in cheek inspired silliness is one of my daughters' favorites...mine also. See huge stars like Laurence Fishburne (years, I say, years before he performed Othello), Phil Hart and S. Epatha Merkerson have fun teaching the 2-5 year old contigency...it is great stuff I believe you and your kids will get a kick out of..."
4,Good discussion,"A set of very good essays regarding the place of art in modern society-Christian or otherwise. Heyer, a professor of Theology, writes about the nature of art in the Bible; the responses to art by Christians; representational versus non-representational abstract; and the changing landscape of ideal forms. Overall a good read."
1,Agree with JAYMZ,The access plate on the bottom of the pump does not hold a seal. Very poor design. I had water spraying everywhere except up the drain line. Very bad product.
1,Flotec Condensation Pump Absolute Crap,"I bought a FPCP 20 ULST and it is a piece of junk. If Amazon let me, I would have given it a 0 star rating. The safety shutoff switch was defective and caused water to leak all over the place in my attic causing water damage to the sheetrock ceiling. Also it seals very poorly around the top. Please don't buy Flotec pumps, because they are crap."
1,Absolute Junk!!,Do yourself a favor and learn from our mistakes. Don't buy this piece of junk. Mine leaked right out of the box.
1,Crap.,"I bought mine from Home Depot.. and yes I had read all the negative reviews before but gave them the benefit of the doubt figuring they MUST have fixed such a huge flaw in their design.Nope. I had it working for about 2 weeks as a pump for my dehumidifier, and sure enough, I went down in the basement after 2 weeks and water was all over the floor and the pump was just dead. Got my money back and ordered a little giant for $20 cheaper that has 100s of great reviews.Bottom Line: Save yourself the time, this product is crap."
1,Did not work,Pump had electrical malfunction and had to return the pump. Will not replace it because I had to pay freight to return it even thou the vendor did later credit me for the freight
3,Good Music Short Songs,"This CD has some wonderful music on it, however there is nothing beyond what was literally in the movie. So there are some great songs that are only 30 seconds long. That was quite disappointing."
4,Wonderful Album,"This is a wonderful soundtrack! I originally owned the cassette version of it. My 2 favorite songs are ""Sister (Miss Celie's Blues)"" and ""Maybe God's Trying To Tell you Something."" Everytime I listen to those songs, I always visualize the scenes from the movie in my head. If you know someone who loves the movie, I recommend getting him or her this soundtrack."
4,Thinking through Christianity engaging society,"Nida's book is written out of his wealth of experience as a Christian in the anthropological field. It is slightly dated in places (re. anthropological theory) - or at least the older version I read was - but provides a very helpful working through of sociological theory in a way that allows the Christian to recognise how he, she or the Church can meaningfully and intelligently engage cultures with Christianity."
1,Ultimate Greens for an ultimate price: $57.89 a pound,"Although this appears to be a large container in the photo, it actually is tiny. Eight ounces of Ultimate Greens is what arrived, listed as a half-pound, probably to make it appear more substantial. No where in their product information did they mention the 8 ounces, and it didn't show up on the package picture, even in a blowup. With a $19.95 price and $9.00 to ship [although $7.75 for shipping was listed], it turns out to be $3.62 for each ounce, adding up to $57.89 for a pound. Then they charge a 15% return fee. Had I known there was so little product for so much money, I never would have ordered. I feel ripped off."
5,Excelent new 6 tracks,"I got this CD because it was playing in the CD store.Deep Forest I reconized, even that the track Desert Walk sound diffrent, better than the released in World Mix. For me, now Desert Walk 2004 and Night Bird 2004 should be singles of this album, they are so good songs.Sweet Lullaby 2204 is excellent. Ana Torroja sounds good in Sweet Lullaby 2003. The remixes of Yuki Song and Will You be Ready sound better than in music detected. I LOVE THIS ITEM AND I AM WAITING FOR THE DVD OF THE VIDEOS OF DEEP FOREST, THE BEST IN THE MUSIC IN THE TELEVISION"
3,BEWARE! Samples songs not the same as the CD!,"None of the songs on the sample are Deep Forest, the labels are right but the music itself is various other artist. The CD itself has the correct songs, the digital download does not and matches the samples. I found this out when I ordered the CD after listening to the samples only to get a CD thats the correct CD with different songs. I ended up buying the digital album and it matches the samples, returning the CD."
1,This cd is crapola,I didn't like this cd at all. I had gotten another cd of Deep Forest and I loved it but this one was nothing like it. I hated it. Never play it.
2,not for learning,"With only colors and animals available for game options, there just isn't much this toy has to offer. Main problem...now that Santa gave the gift, I don't feel like I can return it. It would be a decent toy if it had more game cards....or, the option to play Spanish only (to see if they can actually figure out the word). Without that, it's seems like it would quickly bore my 3 and 5 year old."
4,Dora the Explorer Electronic Bingo,My daughter loves the game. Only wish that it came with more backpack cards. Only 1 double sided card comes with the game so there is not a lot of imagination. Just stars and animals. She does enjoy it though so it is worth the money..
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,THE FIRST FEW MINUTES THE KIDS WERE HAVING FUN. AFTER YOU PLAYED A FEW GAMES YOUR DONE. THERE KNOW EXTRA CARDS YOU CAN BUY. I REALLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A LEARNING TOOL. YOU MIGHT LEARN MAYBE EIGHTEEN WORDS. I WAS LUCKY AND RETURNED IT.
1,Stuff your ears with cotton!,"As a speech-language pathologist and mother of two, I was appalled by the deafening noise level of this game. I actually had seen this game tested on the news in a story on dangerous toys. This game tested with a noise level that can cause permanent damage to your hearing. My daughter received this as a gift so we decided to give it a shot anyway. My daughter's reaction was ""Mommy, that's too loud"" as she covered her ears. I asked her if she wanted to take it back to the store and she said yes. Again, as a slp I am not a fan of battery-operated toys anyway b/c they limit your child's imagination and can hinder speech and language development, but this game is simply too loud. I will be filing a complaint with the Consumer Product Safety Commission."
3,phillipshead screwdriver set,I bought this for my husband as he was unable to find a set of phillipshead screwdrivers in any stores we visited. He is very pleased with them.
3,very pretty from a great restaurant,"I am a pretty adventurous cook and having eaten at the Millennium Restaurant, I was so excited when this book was published. I was hoping to recreate some of the amazing food that I had tasted in San Fransisco here at home.Overall, I was rather underwhelmed with this cookbook. I found the recipes very involved with a very lengthy list of ingredients. I fear that it is more oriented towards commercial cooking than towards the home cook. It's a very pretty cookbook, with lovely fonts, and laid out very nicely with pretty pictures.Regardless of how excited I was by the meal I had eaten and the arrival of the cookbook with said dishes included, I have NEVER cooked even one dish from it. Therefore sadly, I have reached the realization that it will not become one of my more useful cookbooks, rather it stays in the corner with the other ""pretty picture"" cookbooks."
2,"Looks pretty, but do we really have the time?","Several months ago, I purchased this cookbook to expand my collection of vegetarian cookbooks and reference. Although I am an avid cook, I have not tried a single recipe. They look interesting, but in order to actually prepare them, you would have to hire a prep team. Each recipe requires the preparation of about six OTHER recipes... Just looking at the recipes makes me tired."
2,Not useful,"When I looked through Dearborn Series 66 book, the material seemed incohesive and very dry reading. Since I had doubts on how well the book would serve me on the Series 66 exam, I asked a friend of mine who used Dearborn Series 66 last year whether this book helped her pass the exam. She replied that the book did not help her- the questions on the actual exam were much more difficult, lengthy, and different and that she had to rely on her own reasoning, since the Dearborn book did not prepare her. The Series 7 Dearborn book though is very good."
1,"Great for one week, then Eureka- It Stinks","Got this to pair up with a new Sony R50XBR1 projection TV, to use the HDMI input. My initial reaction was ""this player is amazing"", but after careful viewing of some DVD's I've seen a million times, I discovered that the Denon is guilty of detail removal- images containing subtle color shifts (sunsets, fade-in/outs, ets) will show terrible thresholding errors. A check of another player/TV setup yielded the same errors. I ended up replacing the unit with a Sony DVP-NS90V, which was also cheaper. My conclusion: if your TV can handle HDMI, make sure to do a real world demo of the player you want. Any flaws in the chain from DVD to player to TV will be ruthlessly revealed by today's premium TV's."
4,Surprisingly Open Recording,"I had expected a free for all with Ali and James ""Blood"" Ulmer together, and while plenty of sparks fly thoughout these two long tracks, there is also plenty of space. Ali's ""Address"" and Ulmer's ""Captain Black"" leave plenty of solo space with interesting variences in tempo and dynamics. While all of the soloists play with spirit, only Ali and Ulmer are top notch. This is only a slight reservation, chops aren't everthing!"
4,Great Collection,"I loved this CD. For months now, I have been trying to get a hold of the frist 4 songs on disk one and have had not clue as to where to look. These are the four main songs played throughout the movie (the theme, ending with credits, and the two songs where Tamohome realizes that he is a character in a book instead of a real life person.) These last two songs have been the most difficult paper for me to find. I couldn't get a hold these two songs, because most of the Soundtrack were not longer in print/being released.This album has several songs that I had never heard of (both in the movie and in the sound track. But they are interesting and this cd collection is well worth the cost and the wait. Hope you all enjoy."
3,Lacking,Now your probably wondering why i gave this soundtrack 3 stars. It stinks to put it simpilly. Sure the sound is crisp and the cover is cool with a neat picture of Miaka (sp) but all in all the songs have been rearanged. I mean the opening song on the series has new lyrics and a higher toned beat. You'd think that you would get a better quality cd for all the trouble you have to go through to find it. In other words you'd have to be a Fushigi Yugi fanatic to get this one. The only good song is track 4. All in all if you want the fushigi music from the series then i sugest you buy the DVD since it comes with the music video's.
2,Burnett and Ball Mix it up with mediocre results,"Most actors admit that if its not on the page, it won't work on stage. So despite the gifts of these two great comedic actresses of all time, this episode really lays there. I am one Burnett's and Ball's biggest fans so I rushed to see this re-release. Whoa... was I disappointed. Everything seems to be just a set up for a physical gag - which they are both known for. And the story is utterly ridiculous, defying any real believability. But Ball really liked Carol and I suspect just to work with her and promote her on her show was the goal here. Burnett is game and goofy as you would expect, and Lucy seems to enjoy the audiences reaction to her. Surely the execs at CBS must have viewed this wondering if Carol could handle her own show."
5,Great learning tool!,This is perfect for kids who love construction equipment! I bought this for my preschool age nephew and he loves it!
5,Connects the alphabet and sounds within words,"I bought this for my 3.5 yr old, who loves construction things. He loves it! It is fun for me to read, too. The pictures are bright and lovely. I like how it is interactive, inviting the reader to find items on the page. Also, it is helping him to connect the alphabet, which he knows already, to the sounds that the letters make within words. A great choice!"
5,My Son's Favorite Book,"My 21-Month old son LOVES this book... he is fascinated by construction trucks and such and gets so very excited when we read it. It is very bright and colorful and gets his attention each and everytime. He loves pointing out everything and is always his first choice to read at bedtime! If your little one is as truck crazy as mine is, s/he'll love it!"
4,Fun Construction Book,"My 3 year old son loves this book, he is a typical toddler boy, obsessed with construction and this one is really fun as it talks about construction but also a theme around an amusement park. He loves to say zoooooom! at the end!"
4,Not Just for Little Boys,"This book is a great choice for toddlers and early readers. My daughters and my son all enjoy this book. I only wish the cover was a little more durable, as it is only laminated card stock and isn't holding up to use as well as other better bound books we own. Also, the rhythm of the poetry is not exactly spot-on. But these are minor points of criticism for a book that is otherwise perfectly suitable for what is was intended to be."
3,Durable but dumb,"This toy is very durable (THICK coils don't tangle) but doesn't walk down stairs at all. It would work for one stair then slide the rest of the way down. It lights up and has lots of noises, but as a mother I find that more obnoxious than fun. Very expensive compared to a regular Slinky."
3,Adidas Moves For Her Perfume,It smells great just comes in a severly small bottle for the price of $14 and some change. Not worth the price for that size bottle but great scent.
4,I agree with the previous post...,it really isn't the soundtrack. I have a degraded mono VHS recording of the laserdisk original. I sure wish someone would track down the master videotape and make a DVD of it. I'll be first in line to get my copy.
3,One of Anderson's best,"Mister Heartbreak is Laurie Anderson'e best release, closely followed by Home of the Brave , and then Big Science.On HOTB it is Late Show's blend of rhythm, synth and sax which really shines, though Language is a Virus is very good- with very funny poke at 'tv people'.I have never seen the movie , and IT IS A CRYING SHAME THAT NO DVD OF HOME OF THE BRAVE IS AVAILABLE -SO COME ON WARNER BROTHERS! GET IT SORTED!"
2,Avoid the CD!,"OK, I figure if you're looking at this CD, you're a Laurie Anderson fan and can recall at least twice you've seen her great concert movie, likely at a midnight showing back in the 80's. Well, if you're that person, avoid the utter heartbreak which is this CD. I counted 18 tracks from my old VHS copy of this concert, while only 8 made it to the CD. The banter between tracks is omitted entirely. The tracks are out of order (OK, small nitpick), and it's certainly not worth the effort. I'm sorry, Laurie, but Warner scr-wed you hard on this one.On the up side, the sound quality is good, certainly better than my VHS. But hey, this is a concert film soundtrack, but apparently they forgot to include the second disk. Laurie fans will be livid. (Others merely confused! :)"
1,wrong book,The book details and the look inside relate to another book entirely-one about quilts for babies.
5,A Beautiful Doll,"When my friend bought me the Princess of Cambodia Barbie Doll, all I could say was ""WOW! What a beautiful doll! Where did you get it?"" I am planning to buy more to give to people I know whom would love it as much as I do. I didn't even know that Barbie Princess Collection even existed. I like how there is a brief description of the traditional ""sampot"" and culture on the back of the box. I am going to start collecting Dolls of the World 'The Princess Collection'. I am looking forward to see more Barbie Princess Colletion from different countries."
4,A Beautiful Barbie Your Child Can Play With,"I was SO excited to see this doll for a number of reasons. My daughter is Cambodian and it is just wonderful for her to have a doll that represents her heritage. This barbie is beautiful and (relatively) culturally accurate. In addition, it is made for young children to play with so I don't have to be afraid she will break it straight out of the box. (Although I did buy 2 and plan to keep one in the box as a collectible). Even if your child can't find Cambodia on the map, I highly recommend this doll."
2,"Grossly oversized, not worth the trouble of returning","Well, it was cheap and I wanted something light that wouldn't be taking much abuse. What I received is so large that I can fit my entire 5 fingers inside the headliner while wearing it and still have room. Some sort of clown hat. Not sure if I'll be able to give it away. Super cheap store, so I still might try ordering from them again. Life's a crapshoot."
2,Not so great,"The general shape is right, but the material of the hat is porous and there is no liner. None. There's nothing to support the shape of the hat; there is a piece of plasticky cardboard glued onto some foam that gives shape to the bill. An elastic ring grabs onto the wearer's head and holds the hat in place, with the drawback of causing the hat to attempt turning inside out when taken off.The seams, at least, are straight and appear fairly strong.On the whole, it's cheap and serviceable, but it's worth spending $30 for a good hat, for longevity and comfort.At least the delivery was quick."
1,Totally FALSE!!!!!,"The damn hat is so big it can fit two heads!!! Total lie and they are just stealing money from each person. I couldn't find one person whose head fit the hat. I have atleast passed it out to 130 people!!!! Also, the hat the came over doesn't even resemble the one in the picture. DO NOT BUY THIS HAT!"
2,absurd,"(i am not a native speaker, please overlook my style)In the 300 pages of this novel we are told countless times how much Neal loves Dylan, how their physical need is overwhelming and little else. The story itself could have been told in no more than 50 pages (perhaps even less) all in all.Problem is, this is no porn, though some sex scenes are explicit enough, so that the result is simply boring.This is most absurd because the author seems to know perfectly well what she is doing: the writing is neat, characterization accurate and fairly consistent; action scenes, the few that there are, are well developped. How a skilled writer could decide to write a novel about nothing simply escapes my understanding.Another flaw, more linked to my personal point view, is that the author, a woman, simply fails to catch the difference between a woman and a gay man: Neal is a lovable character but he seems to think and act like a woman, surely not like a gay man."
3,i was disappointed,"The sci-fi story was interesting, and it's nice to read a book with gay characters. However, the main characters can't seem to keep their hands off of each other, even in serious situations. I just found it very distracting."
4,Review on 7 pack,"It holds good information and it is a really good price. This product is perfect for capturing wonderful moments of childhood on easy to store tapes. The only thing that I didn't like was that before I ordered it, it didn't tell me how much time it held. But now I know that it holds plenty of good quality film. I love it!!"
3,should have checked Staples,"I bought these tapes for my mother-in-law's camera that I found at a garage sale. it is a very good camera, just needed a charger and some blank tapes, and for $20 you couldn't beat it. I checked Walmart and Kmart for the tapes, they didn't have them. I should have checked Staples b/c they did. It would have saved me the shipping and handling, of course, what I paid in shipping and handling I might have paid in gas. still a good product."
2,Common sense...I was looking for more.,"I was looking for true, refined etiquette here. This book was only stating the obvious. It is for someone who is starting from ground zero (don't run around yelling on an airplane, don't talk with your mouth full, say please and thank you.)I started to doubt the entire book once I read something like ""a lady spits out her gum before she goes into the theatre"" or something of that sort.A true lady does not chew gum in the first place, it is considered crass. This book didn't even know that. I was disappointed."
2,exact copy of how to raise a gentleman,"it's pretty ok, a little less than I expected.granted-the rules are similar, but give me some deeper insight here, earn your $$, otherwise I would have just bought one book and applied it for both kids"
5,Return to the Homeland,"The group voices on this CD blend in a magnificent harmony, especially in ""The Shearin's no' for you"". I have listened to that track seven or eight times in a row to catch all the nuances of the soloists and just to enjoy the sounds of a great woman's chorus. The solo on Robert Burns' ""A Man's a Man for A' That"" is a wonderful tribute to the poet and to his Scottish wisdom. The songs range from plaintive to plaintively comical (Mickey's Warning). As far as I can tell, all the numbers on this 2-disk CD are traditional Scots' music. The purist will be enchanted and the novice will be captivated."
3,Colonial Foundation...,"Written by my late father, this little book delves into the lifestyles of early Americans before the invention of ""modern"" machinery."
4,It's informative,This is an informative book but it calls for the purchase of a kit to make your ak fully auto. Other than that it is very informative
1,Full Auto Conversion for the AK-47,"It has been (8) weeks and I still don't have my book. This company took my money but never sent the book. They don't give you a tracking number and just tell you it was sent out. Just go to their web site, which is closed down, (I wonder why?). I would never buy from them again, nor do I recommend you buy from them either!"
3,Mediocre toner but does smell great,"This was recommended to me by a friend who has nearly perfect skin. I was looking for a rose toner that could be applied as a refresher as well. The smell of this product is so nice and soothing. Rose, with a bit of herbal-floral scent. The spray is fine, but not micro-fine, so you only need a pump or two. I recommend stepping back unless you like feeling doused. The sprayer could definitely use some fine tuning.This product makes my skin burn for a few seconds after I apply it and doesn't seem to actually help cleanse (when I apply with a cotton pad) or tone (doesn't seem to have made any noticeable changes to my skin tone).If it was half the price, I'd recommend as a nice refresher (not toner) if you aren't sensitive to alcohol-based toners. But for the price I paid (over $30) this toner simply doesn't do anything that water with a bit of rose petal extract might do."
1,Some of the worst acts in Chinese pop,The singing here represents some of the worst things in canto pop. It is unimaginative and poorly sung. There is not even a decent melody among these crudely arranged songs. Disappointing!
1,A Very Dark Book,"This is a very dark book. The first chapter opens with a gruesome description of a boy finding his unconscious mother having miscarried in a pool of blood. This young mother is later sent to a nursing home with a degenerative nervous disease, never to return. In a following chapter, a boy drowns, another is kicked by a horse, another has his face sliced while a woman is beaten black and blue by her husband. In the next chapter, a father steps hard on his young son's hand at which point, I gave up reading the book. When there's totally no joy or humour in any page, what was the point?"
5,Realities in the Wake of AIDS,"""In a debut novel, the realities of gay life in the wake of AIDS are examined through the story of John's life, and in the stories John writes in his journal after his lover's death.--SC""-- zebraz"
4,Powerfully moving drama hits AIDS right on the head,"Anyone who has ever been affected by HIV or AIDS will be profoundly disturbed, then horrified, and finally moved to tears reading this book. It says what so few are willing to say about the tragic emotional impact this condition has on its victims. Truly a masterful piece of literature and should easily make its way into the canon of modern gay writing."
1,"Dark, dreary, and oh so precious","This is lyrical writing at its most sophomoric. In other words, for Peck bleak equals ""serious."" Unrelenting boredom."
2,Hard to Follow,This book skips around a lot and I had a hard time figuring out what was going on. I had to actually back track to figure out who and what happened and how they got where they were.
1,Not a genius,"Dale Peck is not a genius. Not even close. Don't bother. Read any contemporary, who would be better."
5,"Wow, what a great book!!","I've been drooling over the website and now I have the book. Not only is this a very inspirational book, but it gives instruction, recipes and lots of ideas. Not necessarily for the beginner but definately an asset for the inspiration it provides and the ideas it suggests. A few more chapters on pulling arrangements together, the how-to's on putting the displays on a cake and cake cutting would be an asset but certainly well worth getting this coffee table book!"
3,Sugar Flowers,"Honestly, I was quite dissapointed with this book. I thought it would give me a more step by step instruction. I have found other books much more useful."
4,Looking for ethnic heroes,"An intriguing book by Mr. Tarapacki. It allows a reader to discover those of Polish ancestry and to live with their travails as they tried to move up the cultural mosaic and create a career for them that wasn't open upon their integration to the USA. In years past, those new colonists to the USA had to change their names in the hopes of making careers for themselves or keeping their ancestral names and not having those ""doors"" open to them. The book is an easy and enjoyable read not only for those of a Polish background but for all who have an interest in sports and their role in society. The only negative thing that I could find about this book was that it seemed too short in text. Hopefully Mr. Tarapacki can see fit and bring out a Chapter Two."
4,Good sports review,Good examination of Polish American sportsmen. Appears to be complete and includes a lot of info on each person examined.
5,3 books *or so* in one deck,"Quest spells, Tome of magic, Player's Handbook. Those books are needed, yes, but all the Priest spells from them are listed in ONE DECK! I've used these on many occasions. It saves lots of time, especially for an impatient DM. Well worth the investment."
1,completely disappointed,This is a stupid movie. I completely regret paying what I paid 4 it. $15 I think. I wish I could get rid of it
5,One of the best books on the air war out there.,"This book really details what it was like. As a former Navy F-4 RIO, I really liked how the author, a former A.F. Pilot tells it like it is, or was, and the differences in training A.F. vs. Navy, and the air to air tactics, Air Forces obsolete WWII ""fluid four"", vs the Navy's more versatile ""loose deuce"".Do wish the author had included the names, such as ""Olds flight"" was Robin Olds and wingmen; Navy's ""Showtime 100"" was Navy's Ace, Randy Cunningham and Willie Driscoll. ( I was Randy's first RIO)"
4,Clashes,"This is a very good documentary on the history of the air war over vietnam. It is not a fast paced hard-nosed book about some of our best known heroes. However, if you want the facts, you get them with this book. Although not as much fun to read as Fighter Pilot by Olds it gets referenced again and again. Thought provoking."
5,Very well done.,"I'm not a veteran. I'm just a 19 year old kid from Georgia, but I am reasonably well read on Military aviation. I have been interested in it for well over half a decade following a project on the battle of Midway. I have to say this is one of the best books on the subject on Vietnam air combat I've ever read.Colonel Michel did an excellent job on describing the nuts and bolts of air campaign during that war. He described things I never knew, MiG tactics, how the Air Force and Navy handled the problems with weaponry and training. I still can't believe the designers neglected to put a gun in the F-4 Phantom. One can only imagine the kills missed because of the faulty missiles and lack of guns.Definate recomendation from me, however much it counts."
5,2 CD set,"Advertised as 1-CD but mine is a 2-CD set (certain sellers say 2 CD so look carefully) Not a dud in the bunch, wonderful collection from Time Life."
2,Disappointed and Confused,"Perhaps after reading Color Me Beautiful by Jackson I had unfair expectations, however, I feel that Ms. Pooser's work confused a previously workable system. She attempts to improve upon the concepts in the aforementioned work, but in doing so completely undermines the concepts that Color Me Beautiful are based on. What had previously been, to me, simple and effective became unwieldy and complicated. I recommend sticking to the original concepts and using one's own common sense about ""bending"" color rules. It should be common sense that there are some colors that could flatter a person that were omitted from preliminary lists-Pooser complicates that notion to the point that the advice is virtually useless."
1,Poor Quality!!!!,This is the first time that I've been dissatisfied with anything that I've purchased from Amazon. This was an absolutely terrible copy. The picture was so fuzzy you could barely make out the backgrounds and the characters voices were off...the lips moved out of sync with the audio. I read other reviews that warned of poor quality but decided to chance it and I can't tell you how disappointed I am. Take my advice and pass on this one!Red House (1947)
3,Not bad,"This is a system of a Down song that many may have heard. I had to get my fix on this song after a friend told me the band's music is based on an Armeniain genocide. Trying to draw this parellel why listening to this song is not difficult. BYOB may not specifically about the genocide, but is about the presidents of warring countries sending the poor to battle. The lyrics might have some truth to them and are often delivered at a fast paced scream. A decent buy for $.99."
4,A primer for the real rock fan.......,"This is the first album of the rock band BoDeans and is a great introduction to the group. Although the vocal style of Sam Llanas takes a little getting used to, the raw power of the performance and the quality of the song writing makes the transition seemless. This and the next two albums released makes up the bulk of the Best of... with each of the two subsequent garnering 5 Stars each. Subsequent albums, however, try too hard from a stylistic and production standpoint never really capturing the sheer simplicity and musicality of these first three records. If you want a taste of timeless, roots rock with a bunch of good times thrown in, get the first three BoDeans albums. These guys rock. And, oh yes, by all means see these guys live."
3,they're so young,"After seeing the Bodeans progress through the last 20 years or so, L&H&S&D really shows how far they've come sonically. And the DVD drives the point home even more. They really were kids when they started, fresh out of high school, but they've matured and are quite polished now."
4,"Twangy, jangly and cool",The memory of this album somehow popped into my head a few weeks ago. I had it on tape years earlier but it was gone. I further rekindled my aural memory with an amazon visit/listen and bought it. Still holds up very well - still sounds raw and fresh with more than a hint of strutting young dude country attitude - that is good country - not bad country. Their first album I think and still one of their best. If you like Tom Petty's first album then you will like this.
1,"""Slow Ride"" is EDITED AGAIN!!!","I just don't understand how a group can put out a greatest hits compilation and include the radio edit of one of the greatest rock-n-roll songs ever written and recorded and the one that put them on the map!! EVERY Foghat greatest hits collection (including ""The Best of Foghat"") has only the radio edit version. If you want the original album version that is almost 8:00 minutes long and ROCKS, then you'll have to buy ""Fool for the City."" Don't find out the hard way like I did by purchasing every greatest hits collection you can find. Just Buy ""Fool for the City."""
3,"Not bad, but not up to movie maniacs usual detail,,","O.K.,maybe I'm too picky about detail and scale,but to me,this is just an upgrade from the Kenner Predator toys from the 90's.I expected a little more from Mcfarlane since everyone(like myself),were waiting for an Alien and Predator series,, The box set from MM5 is outstanding and that's what I was hopeing for.Normally,I would want to open,repaint and pose ,,but I have'nt even opened it yet,, just kinda O.K.,,NOT BAD,just could of been better."
5,Best Shampoo/Conditioner for Sensitive Scalp,"If you have sensitive scalp that is prone to flakiness and even scabs I really suggest Nioxin. I have tried different shampoos/conditioners and it always ends badly. Not only does my scalp go back to being in poor shape, but my hair is not as good as it is when I use Nioxin.Within just two days of using this product I felt a complete difference in my hair. Highly recommended."
5,I love it!,"The size is perfect! It comes in a set, makes shopping much easier! Well priced and just what i was looking for!"
5,It works!!!!!!,"I have been wearing a full head weave off and on for about 4 years. One thing I noticed was that my hair that was once so thick is now thin. I blammed it on my PCOS and my hair not getting time to breath from being under a weave all the time. With that said I discovered Nioxin system 3. I purchased with causion because it is a bit expensive. However, after using it 2 times so far, I must say it really works."
5,Nioxin - Good product overall,"I really like Nioxin. It doesn't promise new hair growth, but it does give you a perception of fuller hair, at least it does to me. I also think my hair has gotten a little stronger or thicker. Unlike some, I like the smell. It reminds me of Sea Breeze. It's invigorating on the scalp and makes my scalp feel fresh and alive."
1,not right,The scalp therapy does not seem to be the official product as I have usedit for years ( from the hairdresser) and it smells different and also seemsineffective.The shampoo is OK.
1,Do NOT Use Nioxin's Cleanser for Fine Hair #3,"Do not use Nioxin's Cleanser for Fine Hair, System 3. It has SODIUM LAUREL SULPHATE in it, which is known to thin hair. After spending a fortune on this product, it MADE MY THIN HAIR WORSE!!!!!!!!! I am so mad at Nioxin, I could spit nails. Do not trust this product."
1,I Was Disappointed With These Products,"I used both the Nioxin Cleanser and the Scalp Therapy Conditioner. I would not purchase or use these products again. The medicinal smell is almost intolerable. I really do not want my hair to smell like medicine. When the shampoo gets on my skin, it irritates my skin (just try to wash your hair without getting the shampoo on your face when you rinse off the shampoo). I did not feel it helped my hair at all, which has thinned over the years. I do not believe there is anything in this product that has been proven to actually ""grow"" hair. It probably has ingredients to make the hair ""look"" thicker. I really did not like these products. What has helped greatly to make it seem as though I have more hair on my head are volumizing shampoos and mousses. And, they smell much better!"
1,FAKE!!!!!,the product is not the same consistency as nioxin from the store. I think it has been watered down.
5,Love it!,"Menthol, and seems do be working well. Hair is looking pretty good, but its only been a couple of weeks, so will revert back in a few more."
1,Proctor and Gamble ruined Nioxin. Help!,"Proctor and Gamble ruined Nioxin. Help!Help me to find another brand, please. I've used Nioxin for 8 years, but after Proctor and Gamble purchased Nioxin Research Laboratories and moved production to Mexico,they change the ingredients and now it's a completely different product, it doesn't work, a useless junk.They not only destroyed American jobs in Georgia, now they are destroying the great American brand - Nioxin.Could someone recommend some different brand that would work tor thinning hair for women?"
4,Fine Hair Friendly,"I've been using Nioxin for about 15 years. Sometimes I change out for a short period but I always come back. It seems to be the best for my thin fine hair. I've said it before and I'll say it again - being bought out by P&G was not the best thing since the formula changed a bit, but it still seems to be a decent product. It gets one less star for that!"
5,Awesome Product!!,"I love this shampoo & conditioner system. I have fine, curley hair and it really helps to make it look it's best! I also was really impressed how quickly my order arrived at my front door. I will be ordering form this seller again.:)New!! Nioxin System 3 Cleanser & Scalp Therapy Liter Set (33.8 Oz Each)"
1,Disappointed with the product,"After reading the online reviews and talking with my stylist (she recommended the system 3 for my fine and color treated hair) I decided to give Nioxin a try. After several weeks of use I have not noticed ANY decrease in hair loss. My hair is now lifeless and is getting oily at a quicker rate.Also, the smell of the shampoo and conditioner has a horrible menthol scent. I expected the scent to be bad based on prior reviews, but I just could not take it. I don't know if your mother ever used Vicks Vapo Rub on you, but just imagine that scent all over your head. I used to enjoy washing my hair, but now cringe at the sight of the Nioxin bottles when climbing into the shower.Maybe I am the odd one out since the other reviewers really like this product, but I do not recommend it. If you are going to give this product a try I would start with a small bottle first. I spent the money on the liter set and now regret the investment."
5,Excellent product! My husband's hair looks much thicker!,"All I can say this is a great product. My husband, Son, and I are getting wonderful results."
3,Not sure yet,"I was surprised about the size of the bottles being larger than I thought. It does have a medicinal smell, which I would prefer a different scent but I seem to be used to it by now. I'm not sure that it actually is working, maybe it is too soon. I will post again after using for a longer time."
4,goodproducts,"This vendor was bad in terms of no notification when product was shipped. However, I always order NIOXIN and wouldn't use anything else on my hair."
1,nioxin,I order the nioxin system 3 and am not happy with it. The consistancy of the shampoo isn't the same. Very watered down. Doesn't seem like the nioxin I've always used.....
1,save your money,"the shampoo and conditioner are awful. the conditioner does not condition hair like an ordinary store brand. i'd rather by VO5 than this crap. my hair is very long and thin and without conditioner it is impossible to manage. my brushes would rip my hair out, nd even when it dried it was just lifeless and dry. do not bother with these bottles, they are too big to use if you are not a lifelong user."
5,Great!!,Nioxin cleanser and scalp therapy are great!! They do make your hair seem fuller and thicker.I love them and will continue to buy them.
3,Arsene's Bluegrass Review,I found this disc was very old stuff. I really didn't care for it but my older friends did.Got to get more bluegrass tunes.Chow(der au coques)
4,Video - why?,"Great music, but I only play cd's on a stereo or surround system. The first disc eventually gets stuck on the final track after some dreadful noise which I am sure could damage your speakers. If this is the video, it should play on a surround sound system, if not, then at least cut the final track so that the video is on its own. Will probably experience the same on the second disc when I get to listen to it, if not, the first dics must have a problem."
3,Decent Sound for a Low Price,"I am happy with my purchase and would recommend these speakers for home theater builders on a budget. The sound from the speakers is adequate and inline with expectations for speakers in this price range. The speakers are relatively heavy, but mount easily. The grill on one of my speakers is slightly misaligned. Although I would not expect to see this detail overlooked on pricier speakers, I willing to overlook some of the aesthetics given the low price. In conclusion, if you are searching for a inexpensive pair of bi-polar surrounds, the Fluance AVBP2 will suffice."
2,ummmmm....,"not that these aren't a good value, but i simply wasn't impressed with the sound. i realize it's about half of what you'd pay for a decent speaker but in the end what you get is flat and uninspired sound. i had them for about a day."
4,A Major Improvement,"I thought that Parry's previous book was not particularly good, and stated in my review that I would try this one when it came out. I am glad that I did, because Parry is back to his usual high level of historical fiction writing. The story involves the efforts of protagonist, Major Abel Jones, to solve the murder of a Union general in the Pennsylvania coal country. The plot twists and turns, the historical details are accurate and quality of writing is excellent. One aspect that I enjoyed immensely is the character development of Jones. By admission, he is a staunch Methodist, but struggles to resolve the realities of life with the strict tenets of his religion. Reading the entire series makes this internal struggle more interesting. We also get to know Jones' family much better. Parry has given us another good effort."
3,Not a beginner's book,"I'm trying to teach myself this beautiful art. This book is certainly not for the beginner. The concept of a new alphabet each week and weekly projects is a great one, however there isn't enough instruction on materials or form to make it very helpful to those of us new to this art. I'll keep it for reference but must continue my search for a great teaching tool."
3,My Least Favorite Book on Calligraphy,"I was given 3 books on Calligraphy, as a Christmas present from my daughter, and this book is at the bottom of the list.It does contain many different fonts, and the idea of having a practice lesson every week for a year is a novel idea indeed. However, I found this book disorganized, and try to do the lessons with one arm trying to hold the book flat."
2,Not for me.,"Margaret Shepherd's various alphabets make me wonder if she perceives ""calligraphy"" the same way most of us do. Some of the alphabets aren't even attractive to look at. She's more artsy than traditional. I guess there is probably something to glean from this book, but it just wasn't for me. If you're a beginner, get <u>First Steps Calligraphy</u> by Don Marsh instead."
2,Developing Proofreading and Editing Skills (workbook),"The basic book is in pretty good condition. However, it was marked up, mostly in pencil, thank goodness, but also some pen. I have spent a good deal of my time erasing each page so that I can use the book. But, I guess I should be okay about it at such a low, low price! Thanks."
1,PRETTY LAME STUFF,"THIS WAS PRODUCED TOWARDS THE END OF THE ""LUCY SHOW""S SUCCESSFULRUN AND IT SHOWS.BY THAT TIME,THE SCRIPTS HAD ALREADY ENTERED A STEADY DOWNSLIDE IN QUALITY.THIS IS A REALLY BELOW AVERAGE ENTRY FOR THE OTHERWISE ENJOYABLE SERIES AND NOT EVEN LUCY CAN SAVE AN INANE SCREENPLAY THAT (unsuccessfully)TRIES TO CASSH IN ON THE MISTAKEN IDENTITY BIT.A LETDOWN FOR FANS."
1,"Author dishonestly reviews self on Amazon, spams prelaw message boards","I would be very suspicious of this book and its author. There are some things you should consider before you buy this book. All of the people who gave this book 5 stars (I think at least, look for yourself), have reviewed exactly two books--this book and a stupid looking book about Natalie Holloway. Each reviewer gave both books 5 stars, and both were written by the author of this book. That should make you suspect that they're either fake accounts made by the author (really slimy) or real accounts made by her friends (still really slimy). I'll never give this tool another dime. Read Planet Law School or Law School Confidential instead. Caveat emptor."
3,Depressing view of the experience,"The author seems pretty disillusioned with law and law school. The first half of the book is pretty good and gives some insight into the admissions process and preparing for law school. But, most of her advice for after the 1st year seems to be how to get through while putting in the least effort. I hope that most people are not paying 30K a year just to skate through and spend as little time as possible on schoolwork. I'm more interested in getting as much as I can out of my time there, not finding out which professors give easy A's."
5,Destino de Las Almas by Michael Newton,Excelente elección. Michael Newton narra de manera sencilla e interesante la vida después de la muerte. Altamente recomendado dada su reconocida trayectoria y amplia experiencia. Un buen inicio para todos aquellos que se interesan por este tema.
5,One Size Fits ALL.....Well Made Product,Every since I started wearing a Straw Hat out here in New Mexico I had to order them form back east. That is until I foundthis very well made Gambler Straw Hat here on Amazon. I will buy from them again!
5,The subdudes Just Keep Getting Better,"OK, so I'm a bit biased. I own every subdudes CD, and have probably seen them live at least six times. With the exception of ""Primitive Streak"", every one of their previous CDs is worthy of 5 stars. That being said, this may be their best recording yet. As great as their previous CDs were, they never quite captured the amazing musicianship and energy of their live performances. ""Miracule Mule"" simply nails it. Incredible. Buy this CD - you won't be disappointed."
2,disappointing,"I thought this product would be helpful for sleeping, since it was recommended from a friend. However it doesn't work for me. I took it out of the box and it was just in a plastic bag. After trying it for 5 minutes I decided that I didn't like it and tried to return it. The company would only issue store credit because I ""opened"" it. What a rip off."
1,They Killed the Guitar Solos!,"I am totally in agreement with the reviewers who were disappointed by the absence of the Vai-Machio solo-fest. That part of the movie was integral with the story, so it is curious as to why the songs have been deleted.Anyway, as a rabid neoclassical heavy metal fan, I was extremely disappointed with this soundtrack. If you have to get those previously mentioned tidbits, I would recommend buying the video and recording it onto cassette, or burn a CD yourself.The Ralph Maccio acoustic guitar solo where he was thrown out of The Juliard School for inserting the blues riff was based on Mozart's ""Rondo Alla Turka."" The major theme of the Vai solofest was based on Niccolo Paganini's 24th caprice.Eliot Fisk does an awesome job of playing Paganini's 24 Caprices on guitar, otherwise Yehudi Menuhin or Itzhak Perlman tear it up on violin.Good luck to the disappointed heavy metal guitar fans out there."
3,Crossroads,"The main reason I have given this soundtrack only 3 stars is that although the music it contains is very good, it is missing a huge portion of what made the movie so good. Namely, the entire guitar battle for the main charactors soul. I'm sure I am not the only person that purchased this soundtrack after seeing the movie and was very disappointed to find this out. Why have Stevie Via in a movie and then leave out his ""licks"". Rediculous!"
1,Where's my stuff ???,"Where is my stuff ???I still have not received my order!!!!!Many other orders placed after this have already been received with no problems, do not understand why this does not come ...Sincerely I hope that you guys get to solve it as fast as possible."
1,Crossroads original soundtrack,The soundtrack Crossroads was totally useless due to the fact that the main ending song was omitted. It rendered the whole cd unsatisfactory and should not be called the orignal motion picture soundtrack because it is not....
4,Crossroads,"The music is much better than the acting in this film. Ry Cooder's production of classic blues tunes remains one of my favorites today. The Karate Kid steps up to the plate but his performance is mediocore yet saleable. A great story, looking for Robert Johnson's lost tracks, a rendeveouz with the devil, a young love affair and a quest for redempetion make this film very likeable. It is, however, the music that sets it apart. If you are a fan of R. Johnson a lover of the blues then it's a must see/listen."
3,Missing the energy of the movie versions,"The music included on this CD is NOT all of the music from the movie - nor is it the movie versions of the songs. This is a re-recording of the songs from the movie that were done by Ry Cooder. None of Steve Vai's songs are included. While the songs are well done in their own right, they do not have the energy or the punch of the versions included in the movie - maybe misrepresented as the movie soundtrack - okay if you like some traditional blues versions of these songs but don't expect too much."
3,something missing,While it was a good cd i was truley hoping for performaces from the movie like the classical music on guitar and the final showdown.
5,excellent,an incredible book that will keep any word lover busy for a long time. thousands of words arranged in such a way that it would be impossible for anyone to not become adept at etymology studying with this book. Now one of my favorite books.
4,"My First TTD book, and a great one","This was my first book on TDD, and I thought it did a great job of explaining the concept and working through it step-by-step. Really practical if you take the time to walk through his sample application development process. I work through it in detail for the first few chapters then skimmed the rest.But the explanation of the method and its benefits is great."
4,TDD with some UI examples!,"The single best thing that distinguishes this book from the other TDD books on the market is its effort to produce a believable application during the course of using TDD. It even showed a way of unit testing GUI applications, which is easily the hardest thing in-practice about TDD.On the bad side, some nicer abstractions around the UI and any patters he'd come up with to make UI TDD better would've been a great takeaway. Also, he said that he'd be using Smalltalk-style names because that was what it was familiar with, which is totally bogus. The book should be written for the reader, not for the writer -- if he was that attached to and unwilling to give up Smalltalk, then why write it using Java?"
4,mini syndrome plush doll,"I am a Phyical Education teacher who ran a school-wide field day event with the Incredibles as the theme.The Syndrome doll was tied to a stake and buried with sand by each group....great fun, great visual accessory. The transaction was smooth. My only disappointment was that I must have misread its size and really needed the 19"" sized doll not the tiny 9"" one. However, we made it work out fine. ThanksJmJ"
5,"well-written, gutsy and illuminating","This is David Kopay's account of growing up gay back when there were very few books or support groups to turn to, which makes it stand even taller. He describes his experience as a college and professional football player as well as being in a fraternity. I find him candid, readable and likeable. He never asked for any special favours, just the right to live his life his way and do what he knew how to do.I'm proud that David is a fellow Husky; his name adds honour to the reputation of the University of Washington, both as a hard-nosed athlete who hit like a freight train and as a man of courage. Just about anyone could benefit from reading his book."
2,Unless you are a lichen expert don't buy this book,"My husband and I recently moved to the Northwest Cascades. I bought this book to help me identify the lichens in our local forests. Unfortunately, unless you have training in lichenology (like the 2 previous reviewers) this book will leave you in the dark. There are essentially no common names used or listed in the appendix. The photos are good but not perfect. A lichen found on almost every other tree in our local state park remains a mystery to me. This books needs a disclaimer on the cover of ""For Experts Only""."
3,Would not buy again,"These shoes came and were super-cute. I ordered a 10 in woman's and can go between a 9.5 and 10 (but usually a 10)...the 10's were way too big...so big that I couldn't even fake it...had to send them back and get the 9.5's and they fit great. The breaking in period was a little brutal with a couple blisters on day three. After day three I gave them a rest and then went back to them a week later and they didn't hurt anymore. My biggest complaint and main reason for the low rating is that the silver portions of the shoes are peeling off really, really bad with just regular wear....makes it look like I have had the shoes for years instead of just months. The company needs to rid these shoes of the silver material and replace with something more durable before I would buy again. The shoes do have good weight to them...they are just slightly less heavy than a regular pair of tennis shoes, but ease of a water shoe."
1,What a rip-off!!,"I guess the author wasn't making it in the construction business, so he decided to rip the public off by selling books on ""roofing?"". Anybody can buy a copier, type a few lines (in bold bold print and staple the pages together. As they say ""you can't judge a book by it's cover"" or a review either."
5,My sons favorite band.......,My sons very favorite band.....hard to find item at a good price and was a good gift for a hard to buy for person. Very Happy I bought this!
3,Defective Copy - Great Movie from what I can see,"Only the 1st layer works, everything after that is choppy, barely audible. I tested it out on My PS2, Nec nd2500a, and Toshiba SDR6012 DVD-Drives. Same trouble on all three. I see others have gotten bummer copies here as well. I am going to try for an exchange, the content on this DVD is a must have!"
5,tired of watching fat dudes playing nu-rock on MTV? get this,"Just to say ........amazing, perfect image quality and audio.........incredible videos, over 20.........untitled, hit left on the extras.........TRY, documentary by Jonas Akerlund.........DVD Rom features, T-shirts stuff!!Jus to say if Santa dosent gives you this , buy it.Get something really nice for yourself this christmas, you will love it.Ps, look in the future for the Smashing Pumpkins, final show at the metro on DVD!!"
4,A dream come true (if you're a fan),"This DVD is top-notch. All of The Smashing Pumpkins' music videos with the exception of ""The End is the Beginning is the End"" can be found here, along with a few bonuses (boni?). It's cliched to say this, but no fan of the band should be without this collection. The ""Rocket"" video is super cool, and naturally, the greatest video of all time, ""Tonight, Tonight,"" amazes with each viewing.Of course, the four-star review is only applicable for those who like TSP. If you aren't into the band, this certainly won't do anything for you."
4,What's with the Icon,"I have to say first of all that I loved this DVD - finally an opportunity to see all of the videos in one sitting...but why I really wrote this review is to get a question answered:Is there any way to remove the little video camera icon on the top of the screen? It is more than a bit annoying to have that over the entire video you are watching (as if you'd forget that you're watching a video?!?), especially with beautiful videos like disarm and tonight, tonight...Please help if you can!"
3,just doesn't measure up,"As far as video collections go, this DVD is sub-par. It doesn't credit the interviews/commentaries with anybody, so we really have no idea where they came from. All i'm really asking for is a peice of paper that says these are actual commentaries. If it weren't for how much they seem to be commentaries, i would think they were just sound bites from interviews that were kind of just slapped together.There are two videos which really stuck out, though, and made me change my rating from two stars to three and those are Geek USA and An Ode To No One. As a huge Smashing Pumpkins fan, these two are well received, as a consumer the DVD is not. If you want to see a well put together DVD collection of videos check out the beastie boys dvd anthology."
3,I wish I could have enjoyed this more....,"but whenever I'd get the the end of the Siamese Dream videos, and the beginning of the MCIS videos, they would skip like hell. I tried playing it on two different players with the same results. Dont know whats wrong, but oh well. I just really wanted to see Tonight Tonight. It seems though as if it was only those videos, all the others that I watched worked right."
3,not so smashing,"admittedly, everything from Gish, Siamese Dream, and Mellon Collie is glorious and wonderful. everything afterwards reaks like hot garbage. am i the only one who thinks Billy looks like Uncle Fester in ""everlasting gaze""? what i like about this DVD is that it gives me the opportunity to see the few videos i never got a chance to see, such as ""Cherub Rock"" or ""Siva"", but i really could have lived without the post-Mellon Collie stuff. but that's just me, and i could be wrong."
3,Should've stayed away,"For me the Pumpkins have always been about the music ... and I loved it (up to and including Adore anyway). So why release a video collection on DVD that has the most god-awful sound mix I have ever heard. Some of the track's video is also quite grainy. I guess if you're an MTV video-holic and a Pumpkin's ""fan"" this video is for you. But if you love the music, avoid this dvd and just go listen to one of the best bands of the 90's."
2,"Great Band, Great Music...Not So Great Videos","Except for the videos of ""Bullet With Butterfly Wings"", ""Tonight, Tonight"" and ""The Everlasting Gaze"", this has got to be the most disappointing video collection I've ever wasted my hard-earned money on. The low point of this collection has to be a tie between the videos for ""Try, Try, Try"" and ""Try - a short film by Jonas Akerlund"". As realistic and honest as they are, they are just depressing beyond belief to watch. Don't waste your money on this...it's not worth it."
4,"excellent, but missing something","i realized after i bought the dvd and watched it a few times that it was missing the ""the end is the beginning is the end"" video. this is disappointing, as the video collection should have all the band's videos, not almost all the videos. plus, the bonus live track at the end of my disk (untitled) never would play for me or any of my friends who bought the dvd. while it is a good collection of smashing pumpkins videos, it still was a little disappointing."
4,There IS a GOOD REASON why the right cord is longer,"It's because the right side is meant to go around THE BACK OF YOUR NECK. This makes them more secure. I agree that the initial cord length needs to be a foot or two longer so that the extension is not needed.As far as the sound, it's very good for this price point. You should find a secure fit with one of the three sizes.I'll wait to see if the cord begins to disintigrate . ."
4,Wow amazing headphones,"I was a little scared to buy these headphones after reading poor reviews I bought these anyway and they blow my stock ipod ear phones away. I barely have to turn the volume up to get great sound. I might be ordering two more of these one for my brother and an extra for me. Yes the cord can be annoying and makes no sense why sony made one cord longer than the other,but who cares when you get comfortable fit and nice sound. If it wasn't for the cord design these would get 5 stars. These are my first set of in the ear headphones."
2,"They sound ok, but DON'T buy them!","I bought these and was initially happy with the sound and feel. Other than that, I hate them. The cord without the extension is too short to reach from my pocket to my ears. If I put in the extender, it will reach from the floor to my ears with plenty of slack. A piece of the earbud popped off and broke after a few weeks, so I had to get a warranty service to get them replaced. Sony shipped me back the wrong color, so I had to ship those back to get the right color. Those broke in two weeks. I was very careful with both pairs...they just broke. Unless you love talking to someone in India every two weeks to get your broken headphones replaced, don't get these. I boughtApple M9394G/B iPod In-Ear Headphonesto replace these and I've been very happy with them."
4,Nice headphones; frustrating wires,"I had mine for a year before they became unusable, and I plan on buying a second pair because the price is just so right. I had no issues with the cables rotting, but I couldn't stand the length of the cords. I am a big-time runner, and I'll go nine or so miles with these things in. While, unlike other headphones, they didn't continually fall out, I would still pull them out because of the weird length of the left headphone wire. So I ended up having to keep my arms super close to my stomach when running which began to screw up my running posture. Overall, though, they are great headphones for public transportation and long car drives. I loved them, just hated the wire lengths."
4,for running,"I use these headphones for running and love them. With the different size ear pieces, the fit is good. The one problem for me is, they only last 3-5 months. Only one side continues to work. I guess that's what happens for the price and using them to workout/run with."
2,"Crisp audio, but lacking in Lower Frequency","I purchased these ear buds a few months ago and they are not bad for the price. I enjoy falling asleep to soft music and the small size of these ear buds is ideal for that. I found them comfortable to wear even with my head lying on top of the ear buds. I found the wiring to be somewhat cheap in construction and the lower frequency to be the quality of that of less expensive models. I am not as concerned with the lower frequency issue while I am falling asleep, but I would definitely recommend other ear pieces for daily music listening. In hind sight, I would have purchased something else.Pros-comfortable-crisp high frequency audio-reasonable priceCons-Poor Low Frequency-Cheap wiring and construction-Case is kind of lame."
2,Half and Half,"These headphones produce incredible sound, however, as other customers have pointed out, the wiring in the product is not up to par. Having bought a new mp3 player, I wanted some nice headphones that didn't cost alot, and these seemed like the perfect solution. And they were, until after a little over a week's light usage the left ear-bud died mysteriously, and I have yet to discover the cause. For a few days I could remedy the problem by tapping on the ear-bud whenever the sound cut out, but now I can't find any solution to the problem, so now I have a pair of good quality headphones for one ear..."
4,Wire rot,"I've had these headphones for about 2 years now. I dont use them on a daily basis, but often enough I suppose. I love them because u can leave them in your ears for hours and they dont hurt. The sound quality is great for my simple needs.I too though have developed the problem of ""wire rot"" as it was described by the previous reviewer. Its very weird how the wire is just kind of falling apart. I think that without the protective covering on the delicate wires, they will break soon. Not to mention the fact that they are starting to look like garbage. I'm seriously questioning whether I should buy another pair. It was a great run while it lasted."
5,Sony MDR-EX71SLA,"Great headphones, almost as good as any noise cancellation system. Great price too."
3,A bit uncomfortable.,"I bought these headphones for use when working out. I wanted something water tolerant. These headphones are definitely water (sweat) tolerant, but I have to say they are a bit uncomfortable."
3,"Good, but beware the build quality","THE GOOD: These are decent all-around headphones, with deep bass, and are versatile over a range of music styles. If jazz or classical are your primary genres, you might find these lacking a bit in nuance, and require something higher end. Otherwise these are a very good value.THE BAD: I primarily use these for the gym and running, which has shown the build quality to be somewhat lacking. Between the jostling and the perspiration, they will fail after a handful of months. I'm now on my fourth pair. If you are hard on them, these may not hold up."
1,Cable rot & sound quality gone in 3 months,"Only a couple of months after I bought the headphones, the cabling fell apart and now the sound volume disintegrated.Now the volume level is such that all the songs sound like they are being whispered. HUGE bummer.I will never buy Sony headphones again."
1,Decent for the first week,"I bought these headphones thinking I would finally replace the stock iPod phones. The first week they were great sound-wise, though I found they fell out rather easily when the cord was jogged on my work commute. However, after maybe 2 or 3 weeks the wiring in the left ear was apparently faulty, and they now only have sound through the right ear -the left statics in and out. I've had good experience with other Sony products in the past and generally think their sound quality is good, which these demonstrated, however I would have been better off buying some cheap headphones that would at least keep working. Never Sony again!"
4,Good quality.,"These in-ear earphones are great. Although the sound is not the best, you can relax without the problem of hearing noises from around the house or the sound of the cars when walking down the street. You shoudl but them, they never fall off your ear."
3,not up to Sony standards,"I was disappointed with quality of performance. Base is decent, however midrange was poor. the earphones sounded tinny. Poor clarity. Treble was overbearing. To turn up the volume to get decent bass,the highs were ear piercing. There are better values out ther for the same money."
1,Absolutely TERRIBLE!!!!,"I cannot believe anyone can give these better than a one star rating. My wife spent $50 at the Mac store for these (Christmas presnt) but they sounded so incredibly BAD! We exchanged them for the same model, hoping it was a fluke. Nope... the new pair suck just as much! Just to give you an idea... there was very little discernable difference between any of the EQ settings on my iPod. I tried Bass Boost, Trebble Reducer... practically nothing! Just teeny-tiny-tinny sound. And I really didn't find them very comfortable. I am going back to the store tomorrow and will probably just get my money back. Absolutely DO NOT BUY THESE! I don't understand how Sony could've put these on the market."
2,"The sound is good, everything else sucks","These earphones do sound good and they are cheap. However, the design is horrid. The earbuds wont stick in your ears, and they hurt when you jam them in. They will fall out constantly. The cord is ridiculos, either way too long with the extension, or way too short with out. The cord is also uneven, with a weird silver sony logo which hangs by your cheek. Also, the cord is very cheap and thin. Will probably break in a few months. The design team should all loose their jobs, because these suck big time."
1,Perfect if you only have one ear!,I have purchased two pairs of these earphones and both have ended up with sound coming from only one ear within about 90 days. Don't worry both times it was just after the warranty expired. Why did I purchase a second pair? I don't know. They are also terrible for working out. If you don't hold the cord while running you will hear a nice thumping noise every time the cord hits your body. It's a great unwanted bass line. I highly recommend not wasting your money on this product. You will be using your Apple earphones in a matter of weeks.
3,Son agudos,"Demasiado agudos, no tienen nada de bajos y viniendo de un sennheiser cuyo sonido es espectacular, estos de sony no me gustaron para nada.El tamaño del cable es generoso y se ve muy elegante, el acabado es de lujo.Si Sony es así, pues no me gusta su estilo."
1,I did not like these headphone at all!,"I will say that the sound the headphone's produce is top quality, which can be directly attributed to its bud-style design BUT the headphones were completely awkward. I did not like how the left ear cord was so much shorter than the right ear and I disliked having to use an extension piece while working out. They are definitely a high maintenance piece of equipment for something that should be fairly simplistic to use. Begrudgingly, I am back to using the original iPod earphones."
2,Fontopia headphones - not good,"I purchased these headphones becuase they were rated as good for working out and running. I do not agree. They have great sound, however the cord is too short and the extention piece knocks around when you run with them. I wear my ipod attached to my shorts, so the cord needs to be long enough to reach my waist from my ears. These are NOT the headphones for this purpose."
2,"Great sound, bad quality!!! Two pairs shorted out!!","I came across these headphones when I first bought my MP3 player and fell in love with them. They do a great job of blocking outside noise and allow you to listen to your music at lower volumes. I honestly heard things in songs I never had before. The sound quality is great!However, my first pair of headphones shorted in the right channel. I bought another pair and a few months later another short, this time from the left channel. Luckily my MP3 player has two audio outs, but it's ridiculous that these are so fragile. After paying ~$80 on two headphones I am extremely disappointed. Buyer beware!!"
5,great sounding earphones,I found these earphones to be very good. They totally block any outside noise and if you have small ears which I do they actually fit. They don't hurt your ears and the ruuber tips help them to stay in place. They offer 3 tip sizes to also adjust for comfort. The cord can be very long or short depending on how you wear it. As with any earsets you need to be careful with the wires so they don't get tangled and actually take some care in them. I rate them positively and they are so much nicer and comfortable then the ones that ipod gives you with the ipod. Hope you enjoy!
3,Great until they break (and they will),"I have owned 2 pairs of these earbuds, and I must say the sound quality and fit is excellent for the money. However, my second pair has broken again in the past week, with the exact same problem that caused my first pair to go. The right earbud no longer works, due to the flimsy wiring. I wear these every day during my commute, but do not abuse them. Both pairs I have owned lasted almost exactly 1 year before this issue occurred. Again, they were great while they lasted (awesome bass), but the third time will not be a charm, because there won't be a third time for me."
3,They sent me the wrong extension cord?,Well I just got these today and when I opened them the extension cord does not fit into my ipod. I though the extension cord were suppose to be 3.5mm jacks(or i was told) I think i might have to exchange them for another pair.. other than that these earbuds are great..
3,"Ok, but what's up with the new case...","Just bought these headphones for a backup in case my Ultimate Ears SuperFi.5 EBs need warranty service. They sound ok, have decent isolation, and are perfectly comfortable, but I've had problems with previous versions of them having a substandard wire coating that rubbed off when exposed to sweat. Hopefully since I'm not using these all the time that won't happen (and since they apparently changed the material they were using).What the heck were they thinking with that plastic case, how are you supposed to wrap your headphones up in that without tearing them apart?Maybe I'm an idiot, but you shouldn't need instructions to use a headphone case."
2,One Ear Will Die,"Love the sound these put out, they are by far the best pair of earbuds I've ever had.HOWEVER, one ear invariably dies. I use mine every day on the bus to/from work and after about three years I am on my seventh pair. Another pair just died this morning; no more sound from the left ear. Due to the ""molded"" nature of the earbuds themselves you can't really open them up and check connections easily.Makes me think I should just pony up a couple hundred bucks for a nice pair of Shures or something similar with a good warranty instead of throwing money down the drain on these great sounding but poorly constructed headphones."
2,Sony forgot the bass!,"I bought these for my iPod Touch the other day and was disappointed by the weak bass that these ear phones produce. I had to set the EQ to ""Bass Booster"" just to get a better response from the thing. Don't waste your money on these since they will fail in providing a full range of sound."
4,Work great... until they don't work (if you know what I mean),"Well, I've had these for about 4 years and just recently the right bud just doesn't want to pump the volume out as it used to. I can hear just a bit coming out of it but I've tried everything to fix them and it won't get louder. I'm up for another pair I guess!Otherwise, I love it for the short cord option where I plug my mp3 player on my left arm. Works great and the music is very clear. Like others, the bass is not the best but then again I don't need to be blasted on that part when running. I would recommend these as I'm getting another pair."
2,Horrible sound!!! Makes me long for tin cans and string.,"I am so disappointed with the sound quality of these headphones. I cannot wear the ipod nano buds, because they are too big for my ears. So, I thought these $50 Sony buds would be great! I thought, oh la la, how fancy, different sizes...WRONG! Tinny with reverb. The ones that came with my ipod sound much better even when I'm just holding them up to my ears. Don't waste your money. If you do buy them, try these alternative (and better) uses: glue scrubbies on them, and use them to clean between your bathroom tiles...or, use the cord as a self-defense weapon if needed...or, get artsy and fashion a groovy necklace by braiding the cord and using the buds as pendants. All three would be better than listening to the crap that comes out of these headphones."
2,"Mediocre sound, mixed ergonomics","I bought these in a pinch while traveling after I inadvertently left my Bose ear buds behind.The good:- They stay in my ears very snugly (something I can't say about the Bose pair)- The cord, while thin, resists tangling (again, unlike the Bose pair)- The price: they're relatively inexpensiveThe bad:- Biased toward the treble frequencies to the point of having a shrill, ice-pick sound. At times, this becomes downright uncomfortable- Weak bass, to put it mildly.- Weird design doesn't provide a symmetrical Y-split: the lead to the right ear is considerably longer. The result is that even a slight tug on the main part of the cord tends to pull the left bud out of your ear.I wouldn't buy these again, even at the low price. Stock iPod buds from Apple are only a little more and have much better sound."
2,Very Annoyed,"One I opened the packaging and tried these out, I felt like punching something. The left channel is considerably less in volume than the right one - a switch in sides proves this. Very disappointed."
1,Stay Away!!! :-(,"What a mistake to purchase this headphone. I thought of this as an upgarde to my SONY MDRE828LP headphones I have been using for more than a year on my iPod. I should not have bothered wasting my money. These are absolutely awful sounding and awkward to wear. The bass is virtually non-existant and the sound is flat as bread. The assymetrical wiring configuration for the right and left side with a fixed connection point is a joke. It feels like someone is pulling on the short end of the wire when you wear the headphone. The earpiece feels comfortable to wear but I could not put it on more then 5 minutes since the sound was so bad. My old headphone sounds a whole lot better all of a sudden! ...Don't bother considering this headphone over other options, even the ones who are lot cheaper."
1,Don't Buy!,"I bought these awhile ago when my iPod earplugs stopped working. I was initially happy with these. However the wire on the Left and Right side are different lengths. Since the Left side is shorter I tend to find when you are moving it tends to pull-out and come loose from your ear. I've tried everything to adjust them properly to my ears, but it's just a bad design. Don't Buy These!"
1,Virtually worthless,"These are the worst earbuds I've ever experienced, excessive echoing and virtually no bass response at all."
4,What I expected,After reading several online reviews re: this product it was what I expected. Good for it's price which was the best value in comparison to other vendors selling the same product. I get good sound with them too. They stay in place with the ear buds really well. I got these to replace the earphones that came with my 30GB iPod which I never liked because they kept falling out of my ears.
2,This is Sony?,"I brought these earbuds because the ones that came with my iPod hurt my ears after a while. I needed something that would fit in my ears comfortabley. After reading the reviews I decided to go with these.For me, these are very comfortable as they give you different size buds for different sized ears.The downside is I do not find the sound to be anywhere near the quality of my original iPod earbuds. I don't hear the base at all with these.The bottom line: If you prefer comfort over sound, these are great in my opinion. But again, if you enjoy sound clarity find something else."
3,good sound when fits,I have small ears and the ear buds do not stay in. They block out sound pretty well when I hold them in but the fact that I have to hold them in makes them pointless to have purchased.
5,these are the UPGRADED version!,"the previous model Sony MDR-EX71SL had a problem with the case(didnt keep the wires from getting tangled) and the cord(the insulation was too fragile). in this model, sony fixed those issues. the case has a different design that keeps the cord from getting tangled and the cord is made of a more sturdy material.as far as i am concerned, these headphones are perfect now. good job sony!"
2,"Great sound, horrible wiring","I'll admit it, these are the best sounding bud style headphones I've ever used. What I didn't like was the fact that the wiring basically rotted on me, for lack of a better word. Before I knew it, there were entire lengths of cable that were exposed when the shielding began to deteriorate. And this wasn't even three months after I purchased them that this began to happen.The headphones still worked but it becomes a bit of a drag when you're listening to headphones that look like something you fished out of the garbage. Not only that, I know at least three other people that this happened to as well, so I know this isn't an isolated thing.If they haven't fixed the wire issue, I suggest you go with something else."
3,Good sound; horrible cord,"I bought these earbuds about a year ago and I can't take them anymore so I am on amazon looking for new ones. The sound is fantastic but the cord length is super annoying. As the other reviewers pointed out, the cord is either too short or, if you add the extention, way too long."
1,Don't bother trying to run with these,The asymmetrical length of the cords basically means that the left earpiece falls out every 20 seconds. The actual sound quality is pretty good if you're planning on staying very still while you use them. Don't bother trying to use these while working out.
3,Great bud - but poorly designed. Returned.,"The sound is great - and the buds themselves are super comfortable. I have small ears and few buds stay in, but these did. Once you jam them down your ear the bass is great. HOWEVER, the the fact the cord is so short is ridiculous - I used them with a shuffle and couldn't even clip it at the bottom of my t-shirt... and I'm 5 feet tall. With the extention it is way too long and heavy on the bud. If they had just added the extra three to five inches this product would be perfect. It's too bad I had to return them - but they were just not functional for walking around. If you wear your ipod in your shirt pocket tho, these are the headphones for you."
3,Mixed Experience,"Choosing a rating was tough. The sound quality and noise suppression factor is wonderful. I work in an office where it can get a bit noisy at times. These did a great job of helping to tune out the noise, while presenting me with quality sound from my MP3 player. The fact that the earbuds are the 'in ear' style enable me to keep the music volume down as well.It wasn't until about the 6 month mark that the insulation began to come off of the wires. Then around 8 months, one side just quit working all together. I was bummed. I tried to replace them with one of the cheapo knock-off's from Jbud, but the quality on those was terrible. I'll probably end up getting another pair and just keep in mind that they have a shorter life-span than I'd prefer."
3,Not Bad,they are not bad but if you dont like shoving things in your ears then you wouldnt like them. sound seems good but could use a little more bass.
2,"good sound, short life","Have owned two pair. Positive: very comfortable good sound. Negative: very fragile, they pull apart, fall apart, what have you. Both sets came undone where the two earcords meet, one set the cord developed bare spots which I had to cover with tape. The other pair, the earbud trim disintegrated when I tried to replace the rubber ear pad (these fall off easily by the way). Neutral: you need higher volumes to drive them than most similar headphones. For $15 or $20 good throwaway deal, but not economical to pay more for so short a useful life."
3,Not good for running,"After reading the reviews, I thought it would be good for running. But it is not. The material for the chord transfers any and all vibrations to your ears. Also, the weird wiring with one side longer than the other is a bad design, and I'm not sure what the design was supposed to address. The sound quality is very good if you are sitting still, but the rubber pieces that fit in the ear also produce a lot of noise with any minor adjustments. Nice price, but I ended up returning it. I'm listening to my Senneiser MX400 right now and it's also good for running. I'm also upset at those who wrote reviews saying that this was good for running. It is NOT."
2,"good sound, cord length too short",I like these headphones for sound but the basic cord length is just a tad too short for use at the gym (to plug into the machines) or for use with a shuffle if you want to clip it to your pocket. The extension cord makes it too long and inconvenient. I would not buy this product again.
4,Nice upgrade from the MDR-EX51 Fontopias,"I've used the older MDR-EX51 Fontopias for years; not the best by far, but since I damage or lose at least a pair per year, they offered great performance at a reasonable replacement price.Just fer grins, I thought I'd upgrade to the MDR-EX71SLAs this time, and I've been very happy with them: Same comfort in the ears, same crisp-but-not-shrill treble, but adds a nicely improved bass response.My favorite feature: the two-piece cord, since I use them mostly with my iPhone with an aftermarket adapter with mic. No more extra two feet of wasted cord to get in the way. The new hard case is a little big, but sturdy, and protects the phones nicely when they end up at the bottom of my briefcase.I would've preferred the black ones; too bad they weren't available when I bought mine!"
2,Longevity Issue,"Decent headphones, great sound and comfort, but I've gone through 4 pairs. They last about a year with everyday office use. I have had 1 set which I bought a long time ago, black with the rubber deteriorating away I bought a new set. The black set lasted for a few years, and were great. Three white pairs followed with the same problem on all of them with a much shorter life span. The first set started to short out on one ear bud, I had to try and wiggle the cord to get both ear buds working. I figured this was something I did and bought another pair. The same thing happened to the next pair, I was reluctant to buy another set, but it appeared they redesigned the product where the buds split. This final pair has done the exact same thing, one ear bud shorts out. I unfortunately will have to try another brand. Be cautious if you are buying for everyday use."
3,"Buy cheap, get cheap","There's really not much complaining I can do about the sound. I found them a little heavy on the bass so I just changed my setting on my computer and iPod and was fine. I did have a problem with fit. The earbud in my left ear would not stay put. I tried a bigger size of earbud covering but those ended up hurting with extended use. The problem is the balance IMO. The connection to the extension chord (which you essentially must use as it is very short otherwise) really causes a lot of pull on one side that causes the bud on that side to fall out. But those were minor, the most obvious problem is they broke in about a month and a half of use."
4,Very pleased.,"These headphones are very comfortable! I appreciate the fact that they also reduce external noise, which means I don't have to risk deafness to drown out the typical office crisis. I can listen to my music at a lower volume and not be distracted by all that other garbage so much.I give them 4 stars because the storage case for them isn't very practical or useful. But the headphones themselves are solid, comfortable, and sound great!"
3,Runner? Wear your tunes at your waist? Avoid these!,"These deliver great sound. They have the same hardware as the '-ex51LP' model (which is cheaper.)BUT: If you wear your player lower than your upper arm, especially if you're a runner, these will suck. Here's why: the earphones come on a VERY short cable. JUST reaches about to the elbow. Great for upper-arm strapped iPods, etc. BUT, to get more length, they supply an extension cable that the headphone jack plugs into, which then, maybe 24"" later, plugs into your player. Sounds fine? Not when that connector starts slapping and yanking on the cable as you run. Bet you won't make it 50 yards without one or both earbuds getting jerked out by the weight. And until that happens, it's painful in the ear, and transmits every slap against your clothing as a loud 'thump' to your eardrum.So: Arm-band tunes: Great! But if your wear it lower, get the Sony mdr-51LP'"
4,"Great sound, but short cord","I've tried Skullcandy and Sound Squared, and neither of them have the quality that Sony brings. The base and treble are well balanced so that I can listen to Gregorian chant music one second and Kanye West the next without having to touch the equalizer. By the way, the model that comes with an extension cord is kinda stupid- the headphones cord is too short by itself and too long with the extension cord plugged in."
2,"they're nice, but...","They're nice, but far too easy to damage. They work well. They keep exterior sound out, but I ended up damaging mine THREE times in two months. The final time one of the ear buds stopped working altogether. Don't buy these. They are too fragile."
3,one bud went out after 3 weeks,"I don't recommend these for wear during exercise activity. Maybe the specific item I purchased was defective; but for the record: one of the ear pieces stopped pumping out the jams after 3 weeks of use. I've owned/purchased Sony headphones for a million years, and normally get sturdy products with good sound quality (above a certain price point). This model was not all about the straightforward functionality of your average Sony headphone, from the uneven length(s) of the cords (that made it a sloppy-looking accessory to wear) to the earbud sitting so far inside your ear (I worried about it coming out thru my nose). More for the record: sound quality was fantastic."
1,"Great Sound and Isolation, Wiring Insulation Fell Apart","Excellent isolation and sound.However after less than a year of use the wiring insulation become dark and was falling apart. I fairly careful with them too, but they're just made of really low quality plastic/rubber.I recommend the Creative Headphones EP-630 which I got as a replacement. The build quality is better but the bass is not as good as the Sony's."
4,Good product,Love the headphones. Wiring seems to have improved over the previous model by Sony. Sound is good. They feel solid in the ear and block out most noise. Carry case is an improvement.
5,Great headphones for the price.,"These are great headphones for the price. They would be even if they were 50-100 dollars. I just got mine in the mail today and let me first say the bass is unbelievable for earbuds. It is deep and doesn't distort with my Ipod Nano 4g at max volume. Everything about these headphones is great. I also love the behind the neck design Sony used. I think they are much more functional and it makes them less likely to fall out when using them in the gym (which I did today).Again the most impressive thing about these headphones is the sound quality. Great bass, great highs as well. Definitely the best headphones I have ever used with an Ipod. Obviously they don't compare to Sony Studio Monitors or Shure Earbuds ([...] bucks) which I frequently use while DJing but as someone who knows his audio I do love these. For the price you can't go wrong."
2,Great Earphones up to the point it starts falling apart,"I've had 2 pairs of these headphones! The first one lasted 9 months before it collapsed. The second one lasted 4 months before the right side stopped working. Also the right earphone is much longer than the left earphone, so sometimes its not comfortable.In my opinion, there are better earphones for the same price. Now Im searching a different set. Hope to have more luck with my new set."
1,"boy, do I feel dumb","I paid fifty dollars for these at the Apple store on the recommendation of a friend. I agree with the reviewer who noted that the extension makes the cord too long. Unless you have an armband, without the extension it is way too short to be much good. One of the reasons I bought the headphones was that I thought the sound quality would be far superior to the ones that came with my Nana. Wrong. The quality is unbelievably tinny. I am amazed how much better the default headphones sound."
1,I am very unhappy,"I am so unhappy. I ordered my headphones and did not get them. I sent a request to have it resent. I noticed that somehow it was going to an old address and I let them know that it was wrong. The billing was correct but the shipping was wrong. I got an email saying he was resending it but it was again to the wrong address. I sent a request to correct it immediately but it still never came. I sent another email telling them I had not received my items and wanted my money back. This has been over a month now and I still do not have my items or my money back. Please help me to get my items or my money back. I will find my headphones somewhere else.On a scale of 1 to 5 I rate this vendor a -2.Debra Leazenby10120 Holder StBuena Park, CA 90620713/366-5641"
2,Sony MDR-EX71SLA,"I had heard from others that the design on these was poor but I bought them anyway. Trust me in that you will be dissapointed in every way. The cord is way to short and won't reach your ears and when you put on the extension it is way to long and gets in the way and is too heavy. The left ear cord is way to short and the right ear cord is way too long which is a seperate problem than the cord being too short or long. I am surprised that Sony's design team let this pass. Stay away, trust me."
2,Rubber Disintegrates,"Do not sweat when you wear these. If you live in Florida do not buy these. The thin rubber covering the wire from the earbud to the junction of the left-right cords will not withstand human sweat. It then deteriorates upon friction with head, hair, skin, clothes, you name it. Worth maybe $10 because you WILL have to replace them. However, MasterCard will honor a replacement if you have Gold or Platinum. It is part of the guarantee. It will not take even one year for any amount of normal perspiration to disintegrate the rubber on these Sonys. Buy them only if you are planning to do the warranty service through your credit card. Sony warranty is useless. Amazon of course is nonexistent after 30 days. On the upside, they are very comfortable and have a number of ear sizes. Moot points. Put your money on higher quality."
5,excellent,This Barbie doll is definitly dressed in the clothing of the period of King Henry VIII. Her headpiece is similar to the ones that were worn by several of Henry's wives. I also like the backdrop picture of Hampton Court. She is a beautiful doll.
4,"a cultural, lovely doll.","this doll was a wonderful thing, for me to see in a store. it really teaches kids about other cultures, and other places in the world. it really made me think of england, and other beautiful places in the universe. i do not have this lovely doll, but i named her rose pinkette. i think its a lovely name for a lovely doll."
2,Ok for the price,I have had the Boots for about 5 months. The heal is cracked on the right boot. All of the screws in the mid arch support have fallen out and the zippers are starting to peal up on the in side base. The boots have almost no brake-in time and were comfortable. The down side is the boots just don't hold up. now I am looking for a better quality boot.
3,Kind of cool,I don't have any mighty beans at all butt i think that they're cool because you make them flip in your hand and race them and many other things Although I think that this toy should come complete with a racetrack or a carrying case or something but thats just my idea I think that mighty beans are pretty cool
4,Mighty Beans are cool and collectible,"Mighty beans offer a great little, affordable toy that is non- violent based and easy to build on the collection. Kids love to compare them and play imaginative games. Trying to get the 'rare' beans is exciting and now I see there is a case that we will have to have."
1,How to waste $,"I went into the wrong business! What are you people thinking of spending $ on these crazy things. Save your $ . I did! Don't buy them............... save your money and buy something worth it. Take some frozen peas out and roll them around....they'll do the same thing........plus you'll get a bonus, a snack when you are done."
2,What Are These Things For?,"I just got some mighty beans for easter and I have no clue what to do with them! Collect them, sure I already did that! Race em, don't want to waste my money on a track! Play em, I didn't even get a booklet with games! These beans stink unless you can actually do something with them."
1,this toy is terrible,"I bought this toy because I thought they had a purpose, i thought they could roll around or something, what a scam. Dont buy this product unless you have a 5 year old son who doesnt care what hes playing with. Don't be distracted when you see these colorful beans in the package, leave it for the next chump who missed this review. If you want to join the ranks as numbskulls buy these stupid beans. GOOD COLLECTORS ITEM! HAHA (YA RIGHT)"
3,Waste of Money? I Dont Think So,"Some people think this toy is a waste of money, but I don't. I am 10 years old and me and my brother love these things. A kid from his class gave me one and my brother went out of his mind! We both love them they are so much fun! If people think they are a waste of money then that's thier problem not mine."
1,"About As Fun As A Bag Of Dirt, Except Less Fun","Tell me, what do you do with these? Collect 'em? Yeah, I already got 6 at a buck a bean. That's unreasonable. Play with 'em? All of the games in the ""Game Book"" thing are all just a variation of; ""Pick a bean, throw the bean, get closest to the middle."" Look at 'em. No, most of the beans have stupid pictures on them, like a teacher. Now, you might notice that I actually gave this 3 stars for durability. I gave it the ""Trevor Tankian Durability Test"" to test their durability. Here it goes;Part 1: Get Thrown At a WallFor this test, I used a witch bean. I threw it against a very hard wall and it survived.Part 2: Throw It Out Your WindowFor this test, I used the witch bean. I threw it out my 3-story house and it did not survive.Part 3: 4th of July SpectacularFor the final test, I used the teacher bean. I strapped it to an illegal firework and set it up in the air. It did not survive the ride, but it did give me a hell of a good time.LOCAL CRAZY MONKEY"
4,Mighty Beans,"This is a great collecters item for kids and grown ups. I really truly believe that this will become the next hot thing for toys. The best thing about these beans are the limited edition Mighty Moose beans, these beans are limited to 1000. With this hard to get item I see these being bought left and right just to get the elusive bean."
1,Pointless!,"What the heck are you supposed to do with these things? I got them because the commercial made them look like Mexican jumping beans, but they don't jump- they sort of spasm once and stay still. Yes, there is a brochure with a list of ideas, but they are all a variation of throw one and try to hit another. Big deal. I can do that with two pair of rolled up socks. Can anyone explain this concept to me??"
2,Mighty Beans,"I thought mighty beans would be a really exciting toy to have because it could bounce around, do flips, cool tricks. But after I bought this toy, I noticed that it wasnt much fun. Because most of the tricks were hard to do, and may cause the bean to break. I think mighty beans are great for collecting, but not much fun to play with. But, its pretty cool that the bean can stand up. They r pretty easy to make, because its made with a ball bearing. But, if u r a person who collects, I think this toy would be great for u."
2,UGGGHHH!!,"SSSSOOOO Boring!!These are pretty coll for the first day or 2, except then they are soo boring!! What are you supposed ot do with a litle ball that rolls on your hand!! although i do have to sya, i have acceenlty stepped on mine like 3 times, at it has yet to brake!! But save your money!! (and for your info, yes they are little metal ball inside becuase my cousin broke one!"
3,I'm mad at beans,My 4 year old neice bought some beans with her own money and then got very upset that the slide/ramp that she saw on tv wasn't in the package. I guess the adults with her should have checked but they probably didn't know about it and when she opened the package she got very upset. We showed her that she can use anything to make a slide but I still feel badly that she was disappointed. I guess it's a lesson we all have to learn sometime though...
1,Entertaining for the First Five Minutes,"I purchased these for my child since they were BEGGING me for some. I thought, Sure why not?1. This toy entertained my child for a full 5 minutes.. not even. Then, my child threw them on the ground carelessly and never picked them up again.2. This toy isnt educational. Not in the least bit..Watching some beans jump? Ha. That doesn't sound like math class, does it?3. Toy is not durable. 1 snapped open within 10 minutes of purchase. Once it was thrown onto the CARPET, it cracked. Huge hazard. These are ALIVE.. do you really want them all over your house?4. This toy is just plain horrible. It didn't even work! For crying out loud, If i'm going to buy this waste-of-money toy the least I ask for is for it to just work! But no, 2 of the beans wouldn't jump. Probably dead..very dissapointing and just GROSS.Don't buy this. It's NOT-SO-AMAZING."
2,Mighty Beans -- Why?,"These little beans are cute, yes, but that's about it. They really don't do much and the brochure with ideas for games is a bit absurd. The commercial certainly makes them look like they do a lot more than they do. Even the little ramp you can buy separately is only about 8 inches long and doesn't really make the beans do too much. They just sort of slide down the ramp. Big whoop. My son, age 5, thought they were neat for about 10 minutes. Also, if you think about it, they cost about a buck a bean. If you saw them sold individually, you probably wouldn't be willing to shell out $1 for one. As for collectibility, I think they would only end up being worth something if you had a complete set (think about how much money you would have to spend to get that), or unopened packages and what's the fun in that."
3,I think there ok,"I think that there is no problem of the beans having breasts. As long as they have a shirt on, I think it's Ok. It's not like there nude or any thing. Women have breasts in real life to! Get over it!"
5,Fun,"This toy captured my interest because it looked fun, and because I ollect sooo many things I could add these to my collection of collections. The charachters are fun, appropriet, cute, and relative to many things. There are about 14 or so written games and many others you can make up.Personally I enjoy how portable they are. You can do so many things with them and I really enjoy having them!"
5,Mighty Beanz are awsome!,My cousin and I got a three pack of migty beanz and a trik trak. We were very satisfied.These toys are very durable.They are cool to collect and fun to play with. They are educational because you have to use your imagination to make up games. These are great toys for an imaginative kid. I realy recomend them to anyone. These toys are awsome !!!!!

4,Pretty nice piano trio music,"In some circles to describe music as ""pretty"" or ""nice"" is to be derogatory of it, but I mean it in this instance as a compliment. The music by Mr Mays, Mr Wilson (drums) and Mr Wind (Bass) is not ground breaking, but skilled impressionistic interpretations of a handful of standards THE THINGS WE DID LAST SUMMER, INDIAN SUMMER etc and a couple of originals, one by each of the players. Noteworthy: the sounds of sprinkling water created at the opening of SUMMER NIGHT by the drummer and other effects throughout the programme; the music has been beautifully recorded at Maggie's Farm; prominent bass work throughout by Mr Wind. In summary a pleasant programme of easy listening, piano music lovers especially take note."
2,Overpriced,"The cups deserve 5 stars, they work just fine, but Zero stars for the price. Last week, I bought these at Walmart- same size, same quantity- for only $3. Why are these 3x the price?"
3,Yup ... they're bathroom cups.,They hold water and mouthwash .... I use one to put jewelery in it every once and a while. I think I remember using one to catch a moth once. Yup ... they're bathroom cups.
5,Excellent practical advice for a novice like me,"This short book is full of good basic information including defining a romance novel and listing and describing the many types of romance novels. The authors provide guidelines for creating characters, developing plot, and writing dialogue. The basics of selling your novel are included, and there's even a section on what happens after you have a contract. Thanks to this book, I expect to have my own romance novel finished in a few months--then maybe I can quit my day job!"
5,Romance is Queen in Rita Clay Estrada's hand.,"This is a good book and after reading it, I gained knowledge about plotting, scenery, tone of voice and writing romance, as was my goal. ""You Can Write a Romance"" heightened my senses, not only for romance in print but for romance on the big screen. I just don't know how this book could have been better."
1,Don't buy it.,"When I received the product..it looked like it was refurbished. The packaging was stapled together. Eventhough, I ordered a new product. I opened it and it didn't work in any of my connections in my car or in friends. I sent an email stating that the product looked old and used. I got a standoffish response, so I just threw the product away. I don't recommend you to buy this."
1,No!,I should not have been surprised at the cheap craftsmanship due to the low price. The transmitter does not grip my Nano well at all.. and best of all the sound is horrible. I will throw it in the trash and start looking again.
4,A Lot for the money,"Arrived in two days! Emailed seller to inquire about colors available, received answer same day. Unit works fine, I didn't even need to adjust anything; I just plugged it in and hit the scan button on my radio. Obviously, this is not an audiophile quality piece, but it produces a music quatlity at least as good as my FM radio. Some slight hissing/clicking noise between songs, but not annoying at all. I just ordered another one from this seller. The only negative is the shipping and handling price is somewhat high ($10.00), but its total price is still way, way low."
1,VERY BAD PRODUCT!!!,"Hello buyers. the sound quality of this product is far from good. I strongly do not recommend it... I was very disappointed when I began to listen the noise in the radio, instead of my music."
3,Not quite...,"He did an excellent job of criticizing both Bush and, well, every President before him. I was waiting for his constructive ideas: they consisted of, basically, refering back to the constitution. How disappointing! He is a great writer and does some excellent analysis. But he needed to come up with a better basis for his response than merely referring to an authoritative text. He needed to argue for his ideas based on values; based on what is best for the country and the people... what is good and why. And that can never be answered by saying because the Constitution (or Bible or tony robbins, etc) says so."
2,Rambling On and On for 200+ Pages,"The present-day Pentagon budget, adjusted for inflation, is projected to be 23% over the average of the Cold War era. By some calculations, the U.s. spends more than all other nations on defense, maintaining forces in several dozen countries (perhaps over 100). Among current members of Congress, the percent of veterans is now lower than anytime since the end of WWII.Bacevich goes on to assert that we have married a militaristic mindset in the 1990s with utopian ends, that this has been reaffirmed by 9/11 and the Global War on Terror, and that this does not serve our interests. Probably true. However, the vast bulk of ""The New American Militarism"" consists of Bacevich rambling about Weinberger, Powell, Abrams, etc., with little compelling documentation, quantification of impact, or common thread.Bottom Line: Boring."
1,"We are ""seduced"" by war because it works. . .","Diplomacy never stopped a tyrant (and if you don't know what a tyrant is, you're not ready for this book). Only war can do that. Madmen can't reason, but force is something they can understand.Take Hitler, for example. All the diplomats did was buy him time.Diplomats didn't stop the Japanese from starting World War II in Asia and the Pacific, either. It took two atomic bombs to do turn Japan into a democratic country.In the 1990's, in Iraq, diplomacy let Saddam Hussein stay in power so he could set up the ""Oil for Food"" slush fund. Saddam took money that was supposed to help his people and used it to bribe Europeans into not supporting our efforts to defang him.Today, diplomats can't take credit for the new emerging democracy in Iraq. Our military can.But don't tell retired colonel Andrew Bacevich -- as a retired colonel, he should know better -- any of this. He thinks diplomacy is the way to go."
4,The road less travelled,"Andrew Bacevich, former soldier, current academic, provides more than a description of the rise of 'the new american militarism', he analyses the social and political forces that have created the current militarist consensus in the US. There is no scandal mongering about the 'merchants of death' or military - industrial complex here, although those lobbies are present. Unlike 90% of other popular commentators on the problem, he goes beyong the politically convenient, politically partisan, single cause diagnosis to show how hollywood, domestic politics (red vs blue), the post-vietnam army reform agenda and other factors have turned the US from a historically anti-militarist nation into the most heavily armed state on the planet. Bacevich's ""multivariate"" diagnosis unfortunately implies there is no quick, single pill, cure either."
4,Not what you may expect,"This book does agood job at dissecting the reason why we Americans are so easily seduced by war and the use of force but if you expect quick, Bush bashing rhetoric.....forget it. This a thoughtful, complex look at our foreign policy and even the author admits that his account is biased toward his career in the military but have patience . Be prepared to work to familiarize yourself with complexities in strategic thinking, foreign policy, domestic policy and the coordination of those three areas .I have gotten about half way through but already am pleasantly surprised in being challenged in ways I did not expect. EnjoyMaestro"
4,Thorough and surprising,"Andrew Bacevich's ""The New American Militarism"" is a wide-ranging and well-written discussion of the events leading up to our culture of glorification of the military and the current ideas about the use of pre-emptive force.Among other topics, Bacevich provided a good review of Neocons and Conservative Christians and how their ideas steered US policy towards a more militaristic stance. He also discusses how the US dependence on foreign petroleum has influenced our policy in the Middle East.He finishes by offering ""ten fundamental principles"" outlining how we might stand down from the dangers inherent in our hyper-militarism.On the whole, I thought this was an interesting and well-balanced review of recent U.S. military history as it relates to current domestic and foreign policy."
4,America's On The March,"This book confirms what I (and probably most others) suspected all along - a ""military industrial complex"" out of control. According to Spinny (refer to the Now with Bill Moyers show of the first season) Ike originally wrote ""the military industrial and congressional complex"" drives the ecomonic train with virtually every county in the US having a military wares business. And former CEOs like Rummy, Cheney and W want a return on the hugh investiment in DoD - that leads to Iraq and future escapades. Bacevich does a nice job tying it all together along with Hollywood fixation on using deadly force as a solution to most problems."
3,Makes a point but too much 'neocon' bashing,"Bacevich makes several valid points to support his thesis about America's new `lust for war'. He uses `neo-con' excessively which detracts from his research and makes his book seem vengeful against conservatives. Despite his obvious bias, he makes a valid argument for his thesis that should be considered. Liberals will agree with his arguments while conservatives will complain about being bashed. Both seem to be correct."
2,A couple good songs,"I had this album in high school and there's about one or two good songs on here.One was ""Tangible things."" There's this one line where she sings:""Bikers from Waco, wave through my window, with (guns and beer?) and GIRLS holding on from beh--eee-yind...Looking for something LOST... in a shadow of mind....""That's the best part of the album. :) The rest is negligible. Wish I could just download that one song."
2,Good at locking yourself out,"Maybe it's true for all Schlage locks. The inside will open when the outside is locked. At least the door will open. The Kwikset would not retract the bolt far enough to allow the door to open and the $300 Baldwin on my front door will not allow the door to close without twisting the handle. Not sure what brand is left to use try but, I'll think twice before buying another Schlage."
2,Not good quality,"The quality of these dvd's is not very good. Some of the real images of animals are nice, but the animation and drawings look like they were done with the Paintbrush program. It was actually humorous how bad the characters and drawings were. It is obvious they tried to copy off of baby einstein (which I have no problem with), but they failed miserably. I would recommend babyfaith or baby miracle dvd's over this brand."
1,When you order 2 you only get one,"I can find no way to give feedback that one of the items ordered was missing. It came late and only 1 of the 2 were included. There is no phone number only a circular ""help"" section that never tells how to ask or clarify.It is an expensive product that I will buy another way in the future so that I am not left holding nothing in my hand or in my printer. Bad job."
1,The ink is fine ... the shipping is a disappointment,"It's frustrating as a professional photographer that I can't buy ink for my printer in a store. When I have a show coming up on the weekend and I'm out of ink, I'm out of luck. I always try keep an extra supply on hand. I received this shipment in 2 days with no expedited shipping. However, when I ordered the same item last week, it never arrived. After waiting a week and it still hadn't shipped, I cancelled the order and got it from another supplier 2 days after ordering it. I'm not impressed with the sporadic shipping practices at amazon. A little communication about a backorder would have saved me a lot of stress (and a lot of printing and framing the night before a show!)"
5,"It's Ink, isn't it?",It's ink and it works! What else can you say about the manufacturer's replacement cartridge for an excellent printer ?
4,Great Holder,Exactly what I needed for my Samsung flip phone. Looks classy and works great. We'll see how the long the hook lasts but seems to be made well.
5,A Quality Product,"After comparing hundreds of cell phone cases, this was the one! Great quality, great style, great convenience."
2,False Information Listed in this Ad,"I just received my Naztech Ultima Cell Phone Case in Truly Black and was disappointed to find that it did not have a ""360 degree Swivel Belt Clip"", as advertised, but instead has a standard pinch-style vertical belt clip in a locked position (the kind that tends to fall off of your belt whenever you bend at the waist). Even the packaging included with the case listed a ""360 degree Swivel Belt Clip*"" as one of the product features. However, there is a tiny asterik on the package informing the buyer that the 360 degree Swivel Belt Clip is not available on all cases. Of course, this information is not available in the on-line ad prior to your purchase. This kind of false advertising or ""non-similar substitutions"" reflects poorly upon Amazon and will influence my family's decision to purchase from Amazon.com in the future."
3,don't be fooled by picture in website,"when I saw this on amazon.com, what I liked was antique brown color, pure leather look. Unfortunately, when I got it, it didn't look like what it posted online. It looks and feels like plastic. so far I am still not sure if it is leather, because no leather smells at all. I really disappointed."
3,Buyer beware,"Take notice. This item does not have the swivel clip as described. As this was the reason I selected this item over others, it was a disappointment. It is otherwise a nice product."
5,"LG VX3200 home, travel charger","http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006VLOIA/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis works great. It has a green LED to let you know that it is plugged in. It is unusual in that it goes into the outlet horizontally, so that you can easily plug something else either above or below it in the outlet. Neat idea."
4,Is this true - need evaluation based on scientific methods,"I read his first book, then I bought and read the second book, because it reveals what happens in between lives; there are many books about life after life, but not many that explore in between lives. What I am surprised about is that the soul world is like human world. I wonder if we fantasize under hypnosis or that is how it is or mind is playing tricks.I wish the author had submitted his findings to a scientific committee for evaluation, that would have made it authentic, without such review it is difficult to accept his findings.The author should have taken sample of people from all over the world, even from remote parts of the world who are not influenced by modern civilization ever and see if they come up with same answers.I do believe in Soul taking on different bodies as it is mentioned in Bhagavad Gita, one of India's ancient spiritual texts."
5,I liked it and kinda believe it!,"I wish I could experience the notion of being hypnotized in order to validate the true concept of what this book is about. It's about Dr. Newton's clients going ""under"" hypnosis and reaching a state of mind called the ""superconsious"" which has all the stored memory of all of the significant events that took place in one's life. I found it facinating to read about what people say when they are in this state and how it applies to the problems that is occuring in the present(usually past life problems dictate current life problems, at least that's what I got out of it). VERY interesting and I hope it's true!"
5,A Profound Work Tenderly and Precisely Articulated,This is an intricate work articulated in an easy to read style. An illumining and profound study of LBL research which exudes to the searching soul a solid comfort and evidence of meaning to Life here and now.
5,ADVANCED HYPNOTHERAPY & SPIRITUAL REGRESSION,"This is the second in a three book series by the renowned Master HypnotherapistDr. Michael Newton. He continues his case histories with clients in the superconsciousness state. He probes a little deeper into what happens after we leave this earth plane. 69 new cases are presented here, representing a cross section of over7000 documented ones. It is more than fascinating to discover the truth found here.If you read his first book "" Journey Of Souls"", then this has alot more depth.Again I say this is a must read!"
4,Great!,"I take it as metaphor, and this book still had a profound effect on my thinking and feeling about death. My own experience with interlife regression has been a lot less detail-based, and I don't really buy that everyone experiences learning in a lucite block of a classroom, and everyone has a ""council,"" whom they meet in a similar place and stand in a particular position. Stand? Please. But the interlife is very real, and Newton's take on it is organized and comprehensible. I'm grateful he wrote this book."
4,A leap of faith,If you are into the metaphysical it is a great read on post life transgression. He's a little dry compared to Dalores Cannon I think but I loved the book. It's a case study book.
5,The Second of Three....,"If you read my review of Dr. Newton's Journey of Souls, you'll know that I find his work to be captivating. His second book did not disappoint. It took me to the next level of understanding the spirit world, purpose of life on earth, the interactions between spirit and persons on earth, etc. I especially enjoyed the concept of our loved ones reaching out to us now, to stay connected and provide comfort. While I read the books in order, it is really not necessary - this book can stand on its own, and you will develop a deeper understanding of the life of our souls."
3,Not as good as Journey of Souls,"This second book was disappointing to me. After Journey of Souls I was ready for this book to be at least as good. Yet after reading almost non-stop thru ""Journey"" I have read ""Destiny"" in starts and stops. To me it is just plain boring. Too much minutiae."
5,Far out,It is a wonderufull Book concerning things we dont hear much about but should learn about and be open to. Book one is also very good. Passing it around
2,I THINK IT'S ALL MADE-UP FANTASY...,"Don't quite believe all that is in it. Made for a good story/experiment. How can anyone predict what's going to occur!With the patients being hypnotized, they could say anything. More proof is needed than he'll know. We're not supposed to know...As far as I'm concerned it's all fantasy...."
4,Destiny of the Soul,Really brought me into the spirit world. It answered many questions and reminded me that I am a soul who is just having a brief visit on this earth. Thank God!
1,Complete Waste of Time and Money,"As someone trying to understand what I can about spirituality, I bought this book with great hopes that it would help with reincarnation and how the spirit may continue after the body dies. What I found instead was a lot of obvious fantasy. The author claims to have a Ph.D., but he doesn't say from where and in what, so you have to assume he bought it from a diploma mill. He says he hypnotized many people who told him about past lives and the spirit life in between, but he never asked for proof that the past lives they claim could have existed. No details that could be verified were mentioned, just stories about bright lights and separate heavens and councils of elders to punish bad people. He writes what people like to hear, but without a shred of evidence it becomes garbage. You would be well advised to look elsewhere for information about spirituality."
2,WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BELIEVE,TRUST ME I TRIED TO STAY WITH THIS ONE BUT ENDLESS DETAIL ABOUTPLACE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE GOT VERY BORING. HALF WAY THROUGHI HAD TO PUT IT DOWN. WASTE YOUR TIME IF YOU WISH. I WENT LOOKINGFOR SOMETHING BETTER.GENE ADDINGTON
1,This could be the work of Evil.,"There are impostors who claim to be spirit guides, and are truly demons fulling humanity, please readThe Siren Call of Hungry Ghost or go to Stacie Spielman web site and down load her free book.I too reached for this book after the loss of a love one and in my pain believed all this nonsense for years.Jesus Chist died on the cross for a reason.(Thank you Lord for your guidance and direction, you are the LIGHT)"
2,EH good thing I just borrowed it from the library!!,"The fact that he doesnt believe in Twin Flames makes me doubt the entire book. EVERYONE has a twin flame. I have been studying ""New Age"" topics for years and most of this doesnt even seem legitimate. Anyone could just make up these interviews. He doesnt even talk about the important things that actually matter, like ascension, the activation of dormant DNA, the lightbody, etc. But that's just me and my opinion. But if you're new to anything like this, you'd be wowed, amazed and inspired. To everyone else more advanced and on their way to ascension and learning about the Merkaba, it wont really help ya at all."
1,Sentimental pseudomystical commercialism,"How is it people cannot see through this pseudomystical nonsense? Readers cannot see they are paying to be told what they want to hear? The same kind of pretentious creating of mystery out of what we all know, but many of us apparently cannot bear to acknowledge (that death is the end of life) as 'Between Words and Silence', another whimsical warren of wish-fulfilment. Avoid both books at all costs."
1,Life between lives?,"More tosh from the 'let's kill all the trees' industry. Rainforests are felled, just so that pompous poseurs can fool wannabee spirits with pretentious reams of rubbish. It's lies; without your body, you do not exist. When you die, you cease to exist; sorry, but that's life (and death). Nobody has ever seen a soul without a body; it's impossible, just like time travel, psychokinesis, the paranormal, etc. So don't waste your time and your one and only life on this garbage; go and look after your neighbour, join your union, fight exploitation; stop sitting on your butt feeling sorry for yourself and superior to others."
3,"Substantial info, but too scientific for the average reader.","I read most of this book and I felt like I wanted to ""hurry"" up and finish it. It's just too scientific. Grad students and educators will love it. But the average person will find this too complicated and thorough.Unless you are ""specifically"" into reading hours and hours of scientific information, I recommend all of Sylvia Browne's books over this one."
3,Good but not the best,"As much as I love the Rei Shimura books, this one was a letdown...Rei takes on the issue of WWII slave labor and reparations to the victims, which is interesting because it's not something a lot of western readers may be familiar with. However, the book would benefit from a sharper editor; quite a few key plot points are first mentioned as if the reader had already known about them (like Rosa's name, the identity of Morita, ""my father told me about the gold""). I spent a lot of time flipping back, trying to figure if I missed something.If you've never read a Rei Shimura book before, don't start with this one because you won't see how great a storyteller Sujata Massey can be. If you're already into the series, this one is reasonably entertaining but not as insightful into daily Japanese life as they normally are."
3,Enojoyable reading w/ accurate modern Japanese psyche,"I started reading this book only because my husband had it. I am a Japanese woman living in the US, and I found the author, Sujata Massey adequately depicting modern Japanese culture and psyche in this book. I thought the book was very entertaining as well, but the motive of the killing in this case was too bizarre for my taste. This is the least favorite of my husband among her other books. I have read latest two books of the series and I wish I had read in order. Still, it is easy to follow the big picture of what is going on with the main character, Rei's life."
4,Good read,"It's not as good as some of her other books, but it's still a fun read. The male antagonist is wonderfully depicted.Overall, this is a great alternative to a standard grocery store mystery novel. She does a good job of showcasing the main female character and revealing slices of Japanese culture.Great and quick read. You'll love it.iKnow"
2,Good Effort but..............,"The ""book"" part of this is good, IF you are already comfortable with a guitar.I bought it because of the CD, I need the visual cues to help me along.The CD is obviously taken from a video, and it seems to go off on it's own little path right about Track 13. The information is intersting but it has little or nothing to do with what is printed on the pages of the book.I have been using another computer based program that puts this to shame.Don't buy this if you want help from the CD, it won't provide it."
3,Good Music,"Overall this is a good intro to playing the blues. The CD is done well and sounds good. If I had it to do ovewr agian, I would get an instruction book that includes a DVD."
2,repetitive,"This book is useful and contains a lot of good information, but could have been half as thick as it is. Everything is summarized more than once, in side-bars and at the ends of chapters, and key points are even repeated more than once in the text itself. The result is patchy text that is difficult to navigate and next to impossible to find information quickly in."
3,The book is good.,My particular copy was used and I didn't expect as much wear and tear. Also for some reason it had black tape all over the back. weird.
4,Biology,"This book was in new condition,as promised. It was a replacement for a damaged school book and was gladly accepted by the school library. It was also far cheaper than the $127 library replacement price."
5,Very satisfied,Very happy that it came exactly as it was described. The book is brand new and at a great price. Thanks!
3,Exactly as promised,"I don't like the book, I am only using it for school but it was in great condition. It was sent as planned and I received without any complications. Exactly as stated. Would definetly buy from again."
4,bio book,Book was in great shape and fast delivery. Needed for class and was happy with the service. Thank you very much.
2,More expensive does not necessarily mean best.,"I just bought this to replace a cable that had been on my bike for 1.5 years. Here's the problem. The cable that failed after 1.5 years is also an identical motion pro cable. The end bead simply pulled off with no warning at the clutch handle.There was no abnormal resistance and the cable was always smooth. I properly lubricated and adjusted the cable. There was just no reason why it should have failed on me. Nor was there any fraying or friction or skritchy feeling to give me warning. I just got to ride home at midnight in a light drizzle without the benefit of a clutch. Considering that motion Pro is typically a third more $$$ than generic clutch cables, I would expect a longer life.The nylon lining, and general stiffness of the cable seems to be well made. The cables do move smoothly."
1,A series of unrelated events,"Pat Barker's ""Double Vision"" seems unfinished, an exploration of contemporary themes that never quite come together. Kate Frobisher lost her photographer husband Ben to terrorists in Afghanistan. Stephen Sharkey, an acquaintance of Ben's, visits his brother Robert in the country to put together a book of Ben's photos. Robert lives near Ben's widow, Kate. Stephen sleeps with Justine, the au pair and seems to fall in love with her.There is a car accident, boating mishap, sinister assistant, a burglary, affairs galore, and not much in the story that pulls it all together. One is left asking, huh?"
5,"Great book! Practical, useful, and easy to read.","Wish I'd had this book when I started my company! It's obvious that the author has had lots of experience advising business owners. This book covers the typical issues of how to organize the business (C-corp, S-corp, etc.) but it also addresse the other issues that can really mess up your business: naming the business and then protecting that name, hiring and firing employees, financing the business' growth, record retention, cashflow and profitablity, etc. It addresses the ""little"" things that you aren't trained for, even with an MBA, but that can have a major impact on your business if done wrong."
1,Complete waste of time and money...,"This book was written solely to make a buck. The writing is sloppy and disorganized - as if a high schooler dashed it off in an afternoon. There are no specifics - only generalities that any beginner in business - or life - knows intuitively.I'd only recommend this book to a grade school kid setting up a lemonade stand. Really. This ""book"" is more like a pamphlet after skipping the useless verbiage, inane platitudes, excess white space, and filler generalities. My copy looked like it came off a poorly set up mimeograph with slanting text, haphazard line breaks, and assorted typefaces.The premise of the book is good - no nonsense business advice. But there is no follow through! Here is the single line of decent advice in the entire ""book"" - put an arbitration clause in your contracts. That's it.To reiterate, this book is completely useless. It was conceived purely as a moneymaker for the author. I got ripped off, and I write this hoping to save you a few dollars."
5,Face Value Reveiw,I found this book extremely interesting and enjoyable to read. I think this book was aimed at young girls growing up but it can be read by anyone. This book is very powerful and I was gripped by it. I didn't put it down for one minute. This novel was brilliant and thought provoking. It made me think of the fake and plastic world that young girls or models actually live in. Catherine Johnson really captures the characters and is a brilliant writer.
4,It worked for me!,"I'm one of those guys who rarely, if ever, get results from the diets I follow - but this book doesn't miss a beat! Everything that I needed to do to lose weight and get my body hard was included and laid out in a simple format!I love this book, and I hope to one day meet the author at one of his seminars to thank him.My advice to you is to get this book and read it carefully, it contains some really great information that you must know to lose weight."
1,PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"There isn't one idea or concept in this entire book that hasn't been mentioned before in any other more popular vehicle. Workout tips are basic and traditional. The diet plan is basic and redundant, basically a slight modification near plagarism of Atkins for Life. Chapters pertaining to motivaation and dedication make this author look like a phony Richard Simmons. It's not worth your money. Buy a book about a protein diet, along with a book that covers newer-more detailed non-traditonal exercise regiments. This book covers too many topic in too little time, and does not get the job done."
1,Where's the healthy fats.,"As others have noted.. this is a low fat diet.. there's very little fat, healthy or otherwise.I think we know enough these days to know that low fat diets are not really healthy in the long term.Yes, I'm sure you can lose weight on this.. but you won't be taking care of your hormones or your joints with this diet.Christopher, I think you need to re-think your diet.Very low calories and almost nil fat is not a good modern diet plan."
5,Maximize Your Metabolism,"I lost 23 pounds in just 28 days! I can't get over how great this book is and how much my life has improved since reading and implementing it into my life.My body is tight, sexy, and full of energy. I get compliments everywhere I go.I would recommend this book to anyone wishing to improve their looks and their health!"
1,Why are the negative reviews here so believable?,"Because they are recognizable. One example on ""egg whites diary"" and there's no way I'll buy this book, thanks to the reader from Clearwater, Florida. Crackers for a meal? No thanks."
3,Not what I ordered,"Have no use for this product. Prompt attention to email and resolution regarding receipt of wrong item. However, this was the second time within 6 weeks that this happened. They say Amazon has the wrong item number. Hopefully that is resolved."
4,I like It.,I like the songs. I won't get It on line because I'm trying to stay away from Credit cards. But I'll buy It at my record store soon.
4,Good quality stuff - needs a little more strength in the ends,"These cables are very solid, well protected and good quality. I am very happy with the purchase. However, I have found that after time the ends do get slightly loose and vibrate out over time. This is easily solved by gently squeezing them tighter with pliers again.For the money, these are excellent value and a very good quality audio product that is well shielded. I've had no interference or hum from the cables what-so-ever."
5,"Listen, Read and Listen","I read this book on a recent vacation and was kicking myself for not bringing Django Reinhardt CD's with me to listen to while I read. I have been an admirer of Django's music for some time but was unaware of just how much influence his music had on artists of his time. There are three reasons why I liked this book. One, to understand Django's personality the author tells us a little of the history and culture of the gypsies. Two, the backdrop of Django's life story is the Paris music scene during the 1920s, through the Nazi occupation of WWII, and the birth of bebop in the late 40s and early 50s. And three, the amazing life story of what may be the greatest guitarist ever born. All three of these aspect of the book are brought together to create an outstanding biography of Django Reinhardt. But be warned that reading about this incredible talent may cause an insatiable desire to listen to his music."
3,If your'e into Django,then your going to eat up this book. The writing is a little silly and cliched but there is a LOT of info on Django as well as the history of jazz in Europe. The book rolls along nicely and builds up to a climax 2/3s in just before Django's american tour with Ellington. Then the book becomes an extremely dull onslaught of facts rather than a biographical story. I just wanted it to end. then he did this. then he did this. then he did this. and then he did this. Hello... Did the writer just get bored with the material? Alot of research though so we'll have to give him credit for this. and there isn't a whole lot of writing about Django out there so it will have to suffice.
2,Dregni dissappoints,"Like all guitar players, I was excited when this book came out. In fact, I bought it hardcover for $30 at a local bookstore. When I got home, I dove in...more like fell into an overly-comlicated, wordy, and mostly speculated work. I read through so frustrated that a writer could do all this research and then write THIS! Dregni writes in detail about the fierce stares in photographs, and makes baseless hypostheses on characters, yet mulls over other details.Still, this will undoubtedly become the bible for Gypsy Jazz fans because of it's inclusiveness. Don't be fooled by the hype. This is a bad book full of great information."
2,some songs some just so so,some of the songs were great others oh well like buying an old record album.
1,Assignment: Outer Space,"If this were any more of a dog, it would shed. Assignment: run like hell. Again, the Alpha copy is better."
5,Nice single,"The item I received was the Australian import CD with the three tracks as listed by Amazon. It was a regular CD, not a promo. Nice bargain (it was $3 when I bought it) as it has the track ""Hold On"" from the Spider Man 2 soundtrack."
1,Jet CD,Very dissapointed this is not the product i thought i was buying Some kind of promo or something not a real cd. Waste of my hard earned money. Totally dissapointed
1,Not as advertised.....,"The track list on Amazon is not the same as the tracklist on the cd received. The cover is exactly the same, but the songs are not. Sadly I bought this as a gift for someone who especially wanted one song which, while shown on the website track list, was not on the cd. :("
1,Dirty,I was disgusted when I opened this package and saw how dirty the baskets were. They looked used and there was actually dirt on the white linen liners. I had my husband wash the liners and they fell apart. Would not recommend this product.
3,Looks great but smelled horrible!,"I'm not sure why, but when I received these they smelled like a jungle full of animals! I had to let them air out for a few days and spray them down with Lysol, but now they are fine."
5,Easy and Delicious!,I have tried numerous recipes in Pacfic Fresh and found each and every one to be great. The salads and salad dressings are outstanding as are the main courses and pasta dishes!! I have served many to guests and always receive rave reviews!Every cook needs a cookbook collection of reliable and easy recipes that consistently turn out great! Pacific Fresh is that book!!
5,Wrapping Paper storage,"I received this container in great shape. I did have to return it, because it was not long enough for what I needed. The place that I bought it from was very gracious in letting me do that. I really appreciated it."
3,"Good box, loose lid","This does hold a number of rolls well, but the lid falls off if you bump it. Can not be used horizontal, or pass it up and down the lader easily."
3,Expected better,"This is fine for storage, but its a pain in the fingers to use during the holiday season. The lid is really frustrating to get off without some muscle and 4 arms. The top storage compartment doesn't have a latch or anything so if you're not careful when wrestling the lid off, you'll wind up spilling the items stored up top.The other downside is this only holds shorter rolls of gift wrap. I'm sure that was the standard at one time but it seems the 35 inch+ paper is more and more common.Lastly, vertical storage isn't very ideal with something as delicate as paper. Unless you've tightly taped up each roll, they will get wrinkled and torn being taken out and put back into a vertical container.I'd highly recommend a horizontal under bed type of container. Rubbermaid makes some great ones I've re-purposed for my holiday gift wrapping needs."
1,Why would anyone pay this much ????,"I have to confess--I did not buy this particular model, but I have a similar product from k-mart that was no more than $10. It's held up great, has locking side clamps, and a lift off top for storing tape, scissors, ribbon. I was looking for wrapping paper online and stumbled upon this and just couldn't believe my eyeballs. I've had mine for close to 5 years. No cracks. Even so, I could buy 3 or 4 !!!"
2,Covers all but too basic,"I love to read books front to back. But sometimes you just don't have the time and need answers fast. This book will not help you in that. And if you do find what you are looking for it will be too basic. Is a good book to read as a whole and follow the examples as a self taught class. But as a quick reference, it lacks depth."
5,Good Start,This is a good start into learning mapinfo and was a big part of the class I took. The book exercises are very well layed out and easy to understand.
2,Diappointed Again,"What is it with today's jazz musicians? They have to deviate from what they do best and try to become more mainstream. The first cut leads one to believe that this will be a smokin Stern album form there it goes downhill and fast. The mix of ""smooth jazz"" with vocals really bummed me out. This is the 2nd Stern album that has really made me wonder where is head is at. For traditional Stern fans this album is thumbs down..for new comers this album maybe your style."
3,Somewhat useful - could be better,This book has a lot of useful information but I found myself wanting more. It appears to be the first or only one out there though so that makes it worth buying.
2,Outdated and overpriced.,"I was rather disappointed in this book. Much of the material was so ""generalized"" that it was not at all helpful, most was just plain common sense, and some was completely outdated. (Hey Kirk.....High Def IS here!) I would say that maybe 25% of the information was useful. Unfortunately, books covering this category seem to be rather scarce, so there are not too many other options."
5,Ah! My Goddess,"Even if you haven't seen the OAV, this shouln't stop you from falling in love with Kosuke's beloved characters. The movie starts far from the last OAV episode so some information is missed but not to worry. New people to the series can feel right at home. The english voice cast is excellent brining the characters to life. The story is well written and the soundtrack is wonderful. The only problem is that it isn't long enough. If you have read any of the manga, you'll see exactly how much of it is featured in the film. Any way you put it, Ah! My Goddess the movie is a must have for everyone."
5,An excellent anime movie,"This movie is easily one of the best anime movies ever. It has a very good plot, fluid-like animation, and an excellent orchestral score. Although it is very entertaining and pretty much stand-alone, viewers can benefit more if they get some background information on Kosuke Fujishima's work of the 3 goddesses and their earthly friends, since the movie doesn't spend much time introducing the characters and their relationship.Anyway, I enjoyed the movie so much that I went out and bought the soundtrack CD :)"
4,"Good movie, 4 1/2 Stars.","Ah, my Goddess! The Movie - This was a good movie, I have to admit it was entertaining until the middle of the movie. It seemed to ""drag"" a little bit because its as if the story keeps going on and on in circles but then it picks up and it ends beauitfully. The series Oh, My Goddess (this is the movie) is great too, but this movie is worth watching After you see the series DVDs. Overall, I'd watch the movie again by myself or with a friend, because it does take you on a adventure. For those interested in love stories, this is a great movie for you!"
4,strange...,"this movie is one of those movies that you have to sit and think about for a little while,while the animation is stupendous and the charachters are so lovable it is a brain jerker. I would reccommend it to anyone over 13."
3,Ah! Megami-Sama/Oh! My Goddess! - Light Version,"It's like watching ""Oh! My Godess!"" the series... only with much less character development, humour, story line and, well, original drawing.Not only does it look like the entire movie was done by the teám who did ""Tenchi Muyo!"" (maybe they DID do it?), but Keichii looks almost identical to Tenchi Muyo! Plus Celestin's little ""pin-version"", it looks just like that enemy guy from ""Tenchi Muyo The Movie""!Also, the movie lacks the humour that the show had. It's all about drama and soap-opera-ish drama now, what with the new girl trying to seduce Keichii and all. Plus, the final battle to save Yggdrasil was a bit weird. Saving the world through singing?This is like some kind of light version of the tv-series. And it's made for those younger than those who watched the series. And why are all of the angel-versions of the goddesses blonde?!?!?!"
5,IT'S COMMING!!!!,"OUTSTANDING!!THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY! WELL GREAT ANYWAY. I WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN A POOR COPY OF THIS MOVIE A WHILE BACK AND I WAS STUNNED TO WATCH A NEW EP. THE STORY LINE IS SO FAR THE BEST IN THE SERIES YET.IF YOUR NEW TO THIS SERIES I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU GETTING THE FIRST FIVE OAV'S FIRST. ""THE MOVIE WILL MAKE MORE SENSE"".I CANT WAIT TO GET MY PAW'S ON IT."
5,Great animation!,"My friend recommended me this. At first, I thought it would be some boring show. But after seeing it, I love it!! It is a mixture of action, romance and fantasy!! The kind of animation I like. The drawing is very nice!! The packaging of the dvd looks cool. Get it, u will not be disappointed."
4,"Great movie, however","This is a great movie, don't let my negative tone tell you otherwise. It features beautiful artwork and a story that can teach us all a few lessons. Why didn't I give it 5 stars then? Because in my personal opinion, it kind of violates the whole feel of Oh! My Goddess. It starts out great, there is still the romantic overtones as well as plenty of humor to be found (the scene where Tamiya is in the muscle suit trying to convince people to join the auto club was hilarious!) but that soon stops as Celestine arrives on the scene. After the first half hour there is scarcely a humorous moment to be found, which is different from the oav's where they mixed humor and romance very nicely. Overall, any OMG fan shouldn't be without this, and if you aren't an OMG fan, then I suggest you become one, but I think that this film could have been better if they hadn't strayed too much from the feel of the show."
5,More emotional than the series,"The god, Celestin, has been freed from his prison by the fairy, Morgan. He comes to Earth to erase Belldandy's memory and take her back with him, as he was her former teacher. Keiichi and Belldandy's sisters try everything to get her memory back and return their life to normal. However, they must pass a test no pair of lovers in history has ever been able to clear and remain together.This movie is everything you've come to expect from the Ah My Goddess franchise and more. The animation is better and the story is more emotional and serious. It has a very touching ending. This is a must see for any anime fan."
2,"Galaxy, Warp to Boredom","This is a utter waste of time and the money should have used to feed starving children in Tazmania. Nielsen is still around after her big break up to Sly. She still can't act and it shows here. This must be one of the most stupid movies I have ever seen. It looks like something from the late 70's sci-fi phase and it even has a stop motion robot that was terribly done and it was made in 1995. Something about the story is that an evil magician lord who is trying to conquer the universe shows up in some ship and shoots people dead and then everything teleports to earth where it was cheaper to film because then you don't have to build big futuristic sets. Brilliant concept. Anyways, this is purely for the birds."
1,"Great, but need improving","I've searched extensively for a software like this one because it starts you off with the basics, but it is not user friendly. It continually hung up my system and flashed errors. I wish they would do something to improve it in these areas. I would certainly repurchase it if they did. I had to call in a computer tech to get my system back to operating properly. I loved the individual they had introducing the lessons. She made it so clear. This is the type of software I need. Please improve it and send notification. The exercises were exciting and challenging. It's good, but definitely needs improvement. I own other Spanish software, but compared to the way their lessons are set up, this one is best to me. I need to begin with basics, and this one does it; especially when she explains about verb conjugations. It also starts you off with greetings. The others I have don't. They throw you right into nouns and verbs. I like this one of all and pray that you improve it."
5,Great resource for patient's and caregivers!,"This is one of the greatest resources regarding MMD that we have found so far. Hearing Terry's challenges and his positive attitude about the cards he has been dealt have been a great inspiration to myself and my son, who also has MMD. Terry's positive attitude and ability to always find the good in every situation really encourages my son, and would appeal to anyone with any type of disability. We would be interested in any future books the author may write as well. This book is very easy to read and understand as well. We have read it many times."
3,RockFour - 'Another Beginning' (Rainbow Quartz) 3 1/2 stars,"Decent effort by this Israeli, '60's spirited indie pop band. Didn't exactly blow my mind, but it is fairly good. Tracks I think I got the most out of were ""Government"", the title cut ""Another Beginning"", the total jamming ""One Fantastic Day"", ""President Of Me"" (great harmony vocals) and the truly psychedelic ""Route 66"". Just might appeal to some fans of Guided By Voices, Asteriod #4, early Beatles and the Redcoats."
5,This is another excellent book by Katherine Applegate.,Don't Tell Zoey is another great book from the making out series. Katherine Applegate once again keeps the story exciting by the characters unbelievable actions. I can absolutly not wait until the next book in the series to come out. This series is the best!
3,Careful,This toy is incredibly detailed but very fragile and very difficult to put together. Be very careful when removing it from the packaging or assembly
3,"Old Title, but maybe OK",I'm hoping that the info in this title will supplement some other older titles I already have. Mac users seriously need a current version of this type of program!
3,Classic simple clock fits the bill,"There are a million different styles and types of wall clocks available - this simple inexpensive clock is easy to install, looks good in our home office and was very inexpensive."
5,FALLEN ANGELS TELLS IT LIKE IT IS,"When Fallen Angels Fly gives the reader a hard look at the real world. Although its roots are in the coal mining area of Kentucky the characters and their problems may be found throughout our country. The use of drugs and alcohol has certainly contributed to weakening of the family and are a threat to our society. Ms. Thornberry rings true and pulls no punches. During my 31 year career as a police officer, I encountered situations that parallel those so realistically described in her book."
4,Great Product,"This is a great product for removing unwanted hair. It works best on legs, arms, and under arms. But the product package is missing the loofah and the brush which Amazon does not replace!"
5,My son can't sleep without it,"My son who is 2 and 1/2 won't sleep without this dog. He got it as a gift for his 1st birthday and since that day they are inseparable. The dog is extremely durable..I wash it regularly in the machine, flew with us overseas, took him to the park, was dragged, jumped on and eveything you can imagine but it still doesn't even have a tear. I did order a second dog a while ago and I alternate them so poor dog gets a break :) I definetely recommend it for a toddler."
5,The Cutest puppy on the block!,"My son is 5 years old and has had Yodeler since 13 months. Yodeler was a gift to my son when he was hosopitalized. Yodeler is a part of our family and is my sons ""best friend"". Everywhere we go Yodeler goes with us. He is easy to keep clean I throw him in the wash with our laundry weekly. Yodeler is the Best!!!"
5,My Secret Lust,"Well, what can I say...the cover sais it all! I thought it would be a nice collectible for my already creepy set of gay sex books, and to my shock it was more than that. It gives you a sence into the world of the unknown, the odd, and even the never heard of before! I wanted to know more about my fetish, I wanted to read more about it too. You would be surprised how little you can find in book stores and libraries about the fetish for the male foot! To be honest with you...there is nothing unless you're straight and you're into feet of women! So when I saw this book in ""Amazon"" I just couldn't resist, and well I'm thrilled to say that such material...more than a work of art would be like my identity, IT'S ALL ME!"
3,Love Under Foot: An Erotic Celebration of Feet,"I actually thought it was OK. The good news is that this book offers something for everyone that has a taste for the male foot. When I was reading the stories, I thought...some writers were trying to write for an essay contest. ""Hey! We're thinking about compiling a book on gay male foot fetish. Can you write something on the subject? Give it your best shot."" While others really wrote with passion and conviction. They had an understanding of the subject, an insider's point of view. Over all, I give the editor and publisher credit for trying to compile this type of book. Bravo to them!"
2,Well written but very weird....,Why would the author spend so much time writing about men's feet and fetishes? I just don't get it. It is really weird and creepy.
5,owners pictorial guide good book,the book is so helpfull and it takes you one step at a time if you do not know what you are doing like me it help me thank you
2,My amazon experience,"I would love to give a review of this book but the disappointing part is I still haven't received it! I ordered the book on Dec 15th, 2009 and was told it would ship between Dec 21st and January 8th. No book came. I emailed seller and was told it would ship on January 21st, 2010, it is now January 26th and still no book."
5,Holley 135-10 GFLT (30cc) Accelerator Pump Diaphragm,"This is a must for alternative fuels such as alcohol or strong additives such as acetone. If you intend on or foresee running Ethanol (E38/E85/etc.), I would suggest this material, as it's known to be unfriendly to rubber.The 50cc version of Holley's GFLT Accelerator Pump Diaphragm can be found under P/N 135-9."
3,Fair movie.,"There are many plain movies using Bloody Mary as story-lines, this one is just one of them, but to a horror fan like me, this movie looks like an 90's, and a bit boring..."
4,Mary gets scary! DO NOT watch it alone!,"I must confess, I had viewed this film at several stagesbefore its completion. And now, after seeing the finished DVD, I'm happily surprised to see how well it turned out.The girls (and guys) are beautiful! The acting is good. The Special Effects add a lot too.The story is a bit lacking, but what horrorfilm today isn't? The film is written and directed bythe same and in my opinion, it shows. The surprisecomes at the end which I'm not going to give away, butI will say, the 'behind the scenes' gives you ahilarious glimpse into how it was made. All in all, Isuggest this film for a date-night flick or at leastgrab a friend when you watch it because it will makeyou want to leave the lights on!"
1,0 STARS: Nonsensical Rubbish,"""Bloody Mary"" is a bloody mess of a movie, and I mean that in the worst possible way. This movie tries to be cute by making the plot difficult to follow, but the problem is that the story sucks, and the plot has gaping holes in it and the movie never makes any sense. Some movies are difficult to follow leaving the viewer to make some conclusions on his own like Dario Argento's great ""Suspiria"", but this movie just does not make any sense. The acting in this movie is atrocious, the movie doesn't flow well, the script is terrible and there is no atmosphere whatsoever. The result is a movie that is completely unable to create any suspense whatsoever. Avoid this one like the plague because this movie is stupid. Some people call this a horror movie...I just call it rubbish."
1,Bad and i mean BADDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!,i only bought this dvd because i like Corey Montieth who co-stars on the populart.v. series GLEE. i thought it would be nice to see some earlier work of his.Bloody Mary has got to be the worst and i mean ***THE WORST*** horror film evermade. the production values look like the budget was [...]. the only reason and imean ***THE ONLY*** reason to see this film is to get a rather nice glimpse ofCorey's naked butt which i doubt you'll ever see on GLEE.
2,This was horrible,"This was a horrible movie and you really shouldn't waste your money, this movie was garbage. In the leagend of bloody mary you have to call for her, this movie takes away from the story that been told for generations. Trust me when I tell you, I love scary movies, there the best type of movies to watch if you ask me and this so called scary movie didn't do it for me. Don't waste your money......This was horrible!!!"
4,Fantasy Fun,Talon was an excellent book when I first read it many years ago and it is still an excellent read now when I'm in college. I can now see how the plot twists and curves. It makes the book that much more exciting now that I can draw more meaning from it.
1,Who is he kidding?,"McDowell represents an opportunistic strain in contemporary fundamentalist Christian thought. They are correct about one thing: tolerance for everything is unsustainable and, yes, immoral and unethical.However, that does not justify the intolerance of fundamentalist dogma, which promotes intolerance for everything that opposes their narrow view of people and the world. Sustainable tolerance is premised on respect for all people, and an honoring of everyone's worth and dignity.McDowell and his ilk are correct that not everything is tolerable. One thing that is not is the intolerance promoted by this latest under-the-table apologetic."
2,Josh misses the point,"I've admired Josh McDowell for a number of years, but in The New Tolerance, he misses the point. He doesn't ""get"" postmodernism, and so reacts to it. Postmodernism isn't, evil, a plot from the devil, or a conspiracy to compromise our children's values. It is no more contrary to Christianity than modernism was, or premodernism was. It's simply the dominant cultural world view of this generation. The days are evil- not postmodernism. There is a lot of good that can result from a more pluralistic, diverse and tolerant way of seeing things. Josh misses all of them, or at least conspicuously leaves them out. I recommend James Folwer's Faithful Change for a more scholarly look at how to remain ""in Christ"" in a postmodern world."
2,"Brilliantly made, but distastefully sensual and emotionally excessive","This is a movie I felt was strongly enough distasteful I had to write an Amazon review against it. Alfred Hitchcock himself was notorious for pushing the limits on sexual decency in his movies, and I'm sure would have been more explicit in this movie if he could get away with it at the time. It's said to have the most sensual kiss scene in movie history--it turned my stomach because of the steamy passions of the main characters. It also gripped my attention with suspense, but the extreme melodrama and lack of moral boundaries to the characters was unwholesome and made me almost nauseous. A movie can have all the artistic achievement in the world, which this one does, but if it's a turn-off, then so what? I judge a movie based on whether it has something to offer me besides just emotional excesses--and this one doesn't. This movie is aptly named ""Notorious""."
3,If... creepy ideas were a part of our bedtime routine,"This book is well made. The pictures are artistic and the book has a wonderful rhythm to it. However, a lot of the ideas on the pages are just creepy. I'd rather not imagine what it would look like if mice were hair or if caterpillars were toothpaste. These are just not images I want floating in my son's mind as he slumbers!The highlight of the book is the final page, where author Sarah Perry encourages the reader to come up with their own ""If..."" scenarios. It would be a great mentor text for young writers as it is an easy and interesting way to write. Just keep the toe teeth out please!"
5,If,My grandson who is almost four loves this book. He packed it to bring back to Me Me's when he spent the night.
3,Last day of shipping window,The quality of the book was fine but it arrived on the very last day of the shipping window. Not the most efficient use of time.
4,Great iced tea,"This is a good tea. When I first made it, I thought it was a little bitter, but then I added lemon juice and it was delicious. I love this esp. as an iced tea. Very refreshing"
2,Good idea - but has flaws,"I purchased this hands-free device for my Samsung 3500, used it for approximately one week and returned it to Sprint. The ""master-plan"" idea behind the makings of this item is great, however, it did not withstand the road conditions when traveling. I own a smooth riding vehicle, but the reception was interrupted due to bumps in the road. It seemed that the device vibrated."
2,This was a confusing book.,This book has a lot of discription and i liked that. It was very confusing and hard to follw. And characters entered without much warning. I also had to read parts over because they were so confusing. And it went from her telling the story two her grandchild and her in the story.
3,I Rode a Horse of Milk White Jade,I give this book three stars. It was good in the end of the book but I think that the rest of the book was a boring. It was nice to finally have a book based on a girl because most books that are based in Mongolia and China are based on boys and men. I liked how she fufills most of her dreams but I think that the author could have made some parts more exciting than it was. I recommend this book to people who like adventures with lots of horses.
2,I Rode A Horse of Milk White Jade,"I give this book 2 stars. I would only recommend this book to animal lovers and people who only like pretty boring books. This book was slow in a lot of places, especially the beginning. The book was only good in a few places. This book is slow throughout and gets to a happy and sad ending. To me, an ending is either happy or sad, not both. This is not that good a book and there are a lot of unnecessary parts in it. There is only one cool part in the book, she lives with someone of great importance. Definatly not the best book in the world. This book was educational, but still only 2 stars."
1,this book made an honest stab at ruining the himalaylas for me.,"I read this book as a twelve year old who really disapproves of kiddie romance discounting the trauma factor of the""acceptability"" of child marriage and the heroine being almost forced into child mariage to produce ""BABIES!"" traumatized me for weeks and freaks me out now. And not mention her father trying marry her off himself.Lets not forget that the antagonist is twelve years old!It is a sappy whiney melodrama.To this day when I hear the words Karakoram or Kublai Khan my blood pressure rises and it's not their fault, it's this book!My advise; avoid this book, it's traumatizing, unless you want to have a very adventurous romantic part of the world ruined for you."
4,This Was An Intresting Book,"This book was an interesting book. All ages can enjoy this book. The story fits together eventually, though it can be slow moving at times. It could use a little more exitement,and it was sometimes hard to tell what was going on. It did have interesting characters and was mostly about luck. If you want a book that is interesting and worthy of a good review, you'll like this book."
2,"Slow, Boring etc.","I gave this book 2 stars because I thought that it taught a lot about the Mongol empire, culture, and everyday life. The bad side was the writing style. It was slow and overly descriptive. I also did not like the slow beginning and hard-to-get-into plot. The author does not let the reader do any imagining, and so the reader loses attention easily. Overall, I didn't think that this book moved along very well."
3,A literary masterpiece!,"This book is a simply touching tale of a young girl desined for luck. She must find her good-fortune on horseback, even if it is forbidden in the land of the great Kublai Khan."
5,A Book I'll Never Forget,"When i fist picked up this book in a bookstore it was because of the riveting and intriguing cover design. After reading the back I wasn't sure if i'd like it, but I got it anyways. After reading it i'm sorry to have had any doubts. Oyuna's story is that of a brave and amazing girl who manages to overcome her handicap and reach her dreams. I was awed at how incredible Oyuna was, and still am. Oyuna felt ever cursed with bad luck, but in the end she triumphes, and teaches the reader a valuable lesson in turn. After reading this, I follow my gut more, and try to be braver. I'd definetly recommend this book, but be sure to get in paperback."
3,I Read a Book of OK Quality,"I think this book is just OK, nothing special, but it's interesting. It's about a girl who loves horses. When she buys one, she has many dventures with it, including meeting the Khan! I think that it gets a little boring at proints, but i is full of action in others. A nice book for horse lovers."
5,One of my favorites - a former animal communicator,"I bought this and read it to my daughter. We had a hard time stopping every night. As a former animal communicator, I'm so glad to see someone take on this subject in such an entertaining and thoughtful way. I was thrilled with the premise and the message. As a reader, I was enthralled with the story. As the father of daughters, I was happy to read a book about a brave and believable girl from simple, rough origins who was able to shine gloriously.I recommended this to a friend with a daughter who disabled. She is missing part of a leg. She's a girl in love with animals, particularly horses. This was a very healing story for her to read about Oyuna's minor handicap and why that and the fact that she is a young woman should not hold anyone back from believing that you can do anything."
3,It's okay.,"Book wasn't really bad, but didn't think it was up to the author's usual good read. However, it's an okay story."
2,Contains only playable demos,"This is collection of ""special editions"" of three games - Tomb Raider III, Gangsters, and Soul Reaver.Beware. ""Special edition"" is a code word for ""demo"".You can play a level or a few levels of each game but not the full game."
4,Not bad,I love true crime and felt the book was worth reading. She needs an editor though. Quite a few spelling errors which distracted me from her work.
3,Skeptic,"I'm reading the book and find that Linedecker sees two types of victims, those of Christian and military parents and those whose parents were too good to their children. As a result, it will be necessary to find the separate books on the cases to get just the facts and not a slanted view of the subject matter. Apparently, raising your children in a Christian household breeds murderers."
2,another tired ass record shack collection,"i don't know if all this rubbish comes from record shack or not but each of these songs has been released on at least twelve cheapo compilation cds that i have seen on amazon pages....they seem to think that if they change the cover and the title of the album, enough innocents will buy this [...] they are probably right.don't buy this one..... [...]tribute to heaven ? don't make me laugh [...] another shameless attempt to rip off and do to death already tired tracks is more accurate."
3,not the nicest hat,"This hat does not seem like it is built well compared to other hats in its price range. It was beginning to fray the moment I removed it from the box. Other than that it doesn't look too bad, but seems a little on the large size, but that could be the nature of the one size fits all sizing scheme."
3,More music please,"I love this band. I'm as interested as the next guy in their biographies, history, etc. That's fine. But...folks, your currency is the music. Please include more in your next DVD. See Wilco's ""Ashes Of American Flags"" for instance.They are still on my 300 mile radius list (anytime they're within 300 miles of me, I'm going)."
5,One Of The Best...,"There have been a lot of band documentaries over the years, but this is simply one of the best. You feel like a fly on the wall watching the Truckers and their families and friends (as well as fans), tell their stories. Barr Weissman has done a fantastic job putting this all down on film. If you are a DBT fan, you won't hesitate a second to buy this. If you have even a remote interest in how a band gets some success and deals with it and creates its music, watch this documentary!"
4,Great collection of 80s songs,"Modern rock has many diffrent albums with diffrent 80s hits on them and this is one of the better ones. Its 2 disks and includes lots of memorable hits from the 80s. Some of the highlights from the first disk are tainted love by soft cell, the safety dance by men without hats and der komisser's after the fire. On the second disk some of the best songs are if you leave by orchestral manoeuvres in the dark, shout by tears for fears and you spin me round by dead or alive. Overall a really good collection of hits. Recomended."
1,Beware of buying that product,"I made that mistake. I love Saura and I watched Goya long time ago, I liked the movie very much. However, the quality is as if it were downloaded by bit torrent. No language options, nothing at all. Terrible! Everyone selling that trash is actually a thief."
1,Saura no merece atropellos asi...,"Uno de esos tristes casos en los que una gran pelicula es masacrada por los inescrupulosos encargados de preparar una version para DVD. La peor de las copias: no pudo haberlo dicho mejor Teresa Constantini. Comprar esta versión es derrochar el dinero. Si no esta usted dispuesto a pagar el excesivo precio al que ahora se consigue la version (agotada) de Sony, escribale a esa compa~nia distribuidora para solicitarles una nueva edicion."
5,HUNTER AND STRIPE AND THE SOCCER SHOWDOWN Scores Big in This Household!,"Laura Elliott and Lynn Munsinger are an unbelievable team. Both HUNTER AND STRIPE books are illustrated boldly and beautifully, and each is superbly written. Laura Malone Elliott has no peer when it comes to creating meaningful fiction for youngsters (ages 4 to 8) and intermediate readers (teens). My understanding is that Ms. Malone was an outstanding writer for WASHINGTONIAN magazine for years, prior to her immensely successful foray into fiction ... Try UNDER A WAR TORN SKY, if you haven't already, for a look at World War II behind enemy lines; or ANNIE, for an incredibly effective exploration of a young girl's moral epiphany during the Civil War. HUNTER AND STRIPE AND THE SOCCER SHOWDOWN is not just entertaining; it is also full of positive moral values that every parent should want his/her own children to visit, if not outright adapt."
1,Yuck!,Syrupy and overly polished version of this classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. Choose LondonOklahoma! (1998 London Cast)or BroadwayOriginal Broadway Castinstead.
3,"Good detail, poor plot","This is a decent book in that the detail is well done, and the characters are fleshed out more than the norm, but the premise is pretty shaky, and the plot isn't that thrilling--it's your standard techno-military-thriller, albeit more detailed than Clancy. As was stated earlier, the action revolves around a high-technology American force in the sands of the Middle East, fighting an Iraqui and Iranian coalition. Despite the ridiculous premise, the detail is well done, and the person who compared it to Peters's Red Army isn't far off. If you can ignore the plot, and enjoy the characters, you'll enjoy it, but there's plenty of other, better books out there."
5,Tin Soldiers: A Novel of the Next Gulf War,Good story..ive read 3 of his books highly enjoyed all of them .
3,"Great Plot and Detail, lacks characterization","Michael Farmers first book was quite entertaining, full of action and detail. The descriptions of the battles and equipment were also top notch. If you are into tank battles this is your book.I really would have liked to see how the characters in this book felt about the things that were going on in the story. I found I never really cared about the soldiers or could feel what they were feeling emotionally or physically. Mr. Farmer gets some of this across, but not enough to give the book the impact of a war novel like ""The Killer Angels"" by Michael Shaara. It took me several chapters to understand who the main character in the book was.I also took some issue with the point of view character changing in the middle of a scene.Still, I thought the book was good. Micheal Farmer has the potential to become a great writer and I will most likely read his second book."
2,On Your Feet Women's Fritz Flat Embellished Thong,"I wish I did not order this one. The picture looks nice but when I got it today, I really got disappointed. When you look at it closer, the wood beads, sequins and the cloth are very cheap looking. I wish they used nicer sequins and glossy beads."
5,Great gift for a child's library,"I love this book because it shows kids that mommies and daddies can do the same great things. It's sweet and fun to read, plus the repetition is something kids love. The whole series is great."
5,Retro pop from the 60s-70s,"No doubt the best conglomeraltion of pop, garage, psychodelic music. Crisp harmonics, showey power chords, melodic 12-strings. Voices rich in blend and pitch. Good CD to round out your collection."
5,I can't believe I used to shave!,"Get it girls! This is so awesome. I love having smooth legs. Yes, it's very painful the first time, but then it really becomes dramatically less so. It's hardly painful to me now after using it for a few months. Great too is those little black specs on your legs are gone.I can't believe I used to shave! I'll never go back."
4,Satin Ice,"I'm very pleased with this epilator. I owned a Braun Silk-epil, but was getting old so I decided to buy this one. It is much faster, compared to my old Braun epilator, so faster (at least to me) means less pain!, I don't use this ice part of it, just when I'm doing delicate areas. I have extremely sensitive skin, so I couldn't wax my legs often 'cause wax made my skin bleed. This epilator it does remove heair faster and it has force, but, it doesn't damage my skin. I know I can get rid of shavers, they are quick and cheap but guess they not good in the long term.I would recomend this epilator to anyone. Really."
4,when will it arrive???,"by the reviews, i like the product already. im just waiting for it to finally arrive! i hope i have the same luck as most of the women here!!!"
4,GREAT BUY,It met my expectations and that of the person I bought one for. Very comfortable and affortable. Anyone who purchases this product will be very satisfied.
5,Super Weird and very confusing but enjoyed,Lizzie is a girl who has weird things happen to her on Valentine's Day. When we had it read to us in grade three we had many questions as the author does not explain exactly how these things happen. Is it a dream? Was she passed out? We would like more answers!

2,not my favorite,"Admittedly one of their biggest hit singles but, personally, I thought is was just ok and never caught me like some of their other ballads."
2,OK,"Delivery and everything ok. For the price there are not very many pins. This must be a specialty item and I did not look at it close enough before ordering. I'll keep the pins, but won't buy more. I only needed standard straight pins. Live and learn. The pins are kinda cute, too."
3,Buy the earlier version,"Although it doesn't look like the 2003 Princeton Review version of this book is different from the earlier version, it is and not just with typefaces. I bought it thinking they might have updated the resources in the back even though the Amazon blurb didn't suggest any changes. I was very surprised that the 2003 version took out the more negative, or human, stories of students who took time off to get back on track. Instead the new book highlights students who ended up at fancy colleges and makes it look like taking a year off is your key to an Ivy League school. Buy the earlier version which is much more balanced."
5,One of my favorite volumes,"I started on Fushigi Yugi originally through the anime, then resorted to the manga three years ago. This has become my longest series and this volume is one of the best I have read. The action has met its climax and the rival priestess has gained her soldiers before Miaka did, making everything more interesting. And the highlight in the manga in my opinion, Nakago's cold kiss with Tamahome. ^.^ Ok so it wasn't exactly what the events were leading to but one of my favorites.Anyhow, I do like especially to this point how both Yui and Miaka have progressed and to this day, Nakago remains one of my favorite villains. If you are in to FY for the long haul, buy this one as well as the others to follow and complete your collection."
5,"Original, intelligent humor","What a JOY to discover my very favorite recordings from childhood (maybe favorite recordings ever...?) on CD after all these years! And the best part is, the humor and fun definitely hold up. My kids enjoy these wacky, crazy stories and songs as much as I did. These recordings shaped my imagination and humor. They're fun for grown ups and kids, too. They're worlds apart from so much of the cloying, unimaginative kids music out there. I've never heard anything else quite like them. Thank you, Jim Copp & Ed Brown, wherever you are!!!"
4,Highly recommended,"The author has drawn on his years of experience as a teacher to skillfully mix humor and serious subjects in a manner that will appeal to young readers. It is an amusing book that teaches serious lessons about life without sounding didactic. It is a book that children will definately enjoy, and I hope that Mr. Sheehan has other books in the works."
5,A Good Book for Teaching Values,"I was afforded the opportunity of thumbing through this book at a friend's house. Aside from being a good book, it is just refreshing to see children books being written by someone who can really play the role model children need to see in celebrities. Too many stars ""dabble"" in this genre but lack the public character to add credibility to their work. Leann Rimes is star in every sense of the word, but more importantly, she is a warm and real person who projects the values she rights about.As a fellow author of pet loss books, I know how difficult it is to bring a writing project to print. It takes a lot of effort and personal commitment. Given her other commitments, it is obvious that to dedicate the time and effort it took to produce this work she has to possess the values she writes about.Even though I cheated and read someone else's copy, I recommend this book very highly."
1,Embarrassingly bad story,"Received this story as a gift. Badly written, inappropriate and annoying. It represents 10 minutes me and my 3.5 year old son will never recover. Don't buy it unless you are looking to extract information from a native English-speaker upon whom water boarding has already failed."
1,Just about the worst children's book I've read to my child,"I'm curious as to what credentials Rimes has for authoring children's books? I checked out ""Jag"" and ""Jag's New Friend"" from our local library based on the cute illustrations. I wished I would have screened the text more carefully. Not only did the story not make much sense, but it was excessively wordy for a children's book and plagued with all kinds of words (i.e., hate, dumb, stupid) and attitudes that are inappropriate for children. Based on the confused looks from my 4-year-old (very book-savvy) son, I decided to edit and change the story halfway through the first book so that it made some sense and didn't bore him and confuse him too much. Very disappointing!"
5,The Self Reliant Potter,"This book has been my bible and I highly recommend it. I have built pioneer style potteries in Indonesia, and two in Jamaica using kiln designs, kick wheels and glaze recipes from this book. It explains glazes in simple layman's terms and how to locate materials. Simple line blends are explained and I use this technique for all of my glaze testing. I have made both types of kick wheels in this book which are my preferred wheels. I never lend this book out because it is treasured and irreplaceable.The Spiritual Potter."
4,A book that shouldn't be out of print,Don't rely on the glazes but the advice he gives and diagrams that are provided are nice to have around. They helped me out more than once. I guess I'm more visual.
3,I have to read it,"There is a discussion going on in germany, referring to jews in the early sowjet union. Thin book presents some information about this topic,, which I am interested in."
1,1 Star is being generous,"I give this CD 1 star because of the 14th track - it was IN the movie. It actually belongs on the cd. Remember how terrible the first Armageddon album was, with only one score track? Same thing here. It's good, but it's not worth spending [money] on. Wait for the score release (if it's going to be released). The score itself is a mix of ENEMY OF THE STATE and AMERICAN OUTLAWS (and that's a compliment!)"
4,"great movie, great soundtrack","Well the bad company soundtrack is pretty good, I think and to all the illiterate people out there: It says ""music from the motion picture"" on the cover of the CD not ""score of the motion picture"". You might also turn the CD and read the names of the songs before you buy it and then complain about it."
2,Not what it could have been.,"The CD is decent. Trevor Rabin has a serious problem with being unable to produce full Orchestrated Scores in movies like this, another example of it would be Armageddon. Bad Company had a better Orcestral Score than it did regular soundtrack, and I give it such low ratings because there is only one track, only one, which holds the orchestral theme to it. This movie had a brilliant score, and the rest of the music on this soundtrack is plain harsh to my ears."
1,"Re: User ""esbreen""","I'm fully aware that some of this ""music"" was in the movie, unfortunately. Remember that scene in the movie (and trailer) when Anthony Hopkins says ""Is that rap? It's terrible.""The CD has nothing going for it, sans BMBBO (Trevor Rabin). A true ""Bad Company Soundtrack"" would have the score to the movie. Most of these ""songs"" included were in the movie no longer than 1 minute. Trevor Rabin is a musician; these 'artists' are not...."
3,Very Nice Album,"This cd is very nice. I actually purchased this cd for 1 song in particular Rama Duke's ""To keep this life""."
3,score please,"I did like the song of Breathe In, Breathe Out, but I would have loved a score release too. I would like to know the piece of music that had the choir, where he ran into the church people on the steps at the beginning of the movie? Thanks"
2,Hmmm...,Well I had originally bought (downloaded) this cd to find a certain song which I didn't know the name. I was looking for the heavy guitar song during the final chase/action scene in Grand Central Station...If anyone knows the name of it. please let me know...ty
3,Title Tells it,"Note that the title of this book is ""Introduction to Old Church Slavic"", not ""Old Church Slavonic."" It is an exercise in historical linguistics. If that's your interest, it covers the subject in considerable depth and you'd be hard pressed to find another book written in English to do it so thoroughly.However, if your interest is in reading Eastern Orthodox material, this book won't be much help, except in a very roundabout way. Be advised."
1,Hook and Go is a Hook and FAIL!,"I bought this product and just used it today, well I put my bags on it and made it 2 steps when the whole thing buckled and smashed into my legs at first I thought I just hit a soggy piece of ground in the driveway but nope those 2 long metal bars on each side bent out. I was extremely upset, contacted the company and waiting for the shipping company to come and pick up this piece of scrap metal. May be ok if you have light veggies from the ""Farmer's Market"" but not real groceries..save your money on this one folks."
4,Nice driver,Could use a little more power but you can say that with all battery operated stuff. Nice thing with panasonic is the charge time. Batteries charge up pretty fast. Lightweight and easy to handle. I would buy again.
5,Great resource for adults with ADHD,"I bought this as a gift for my 29 year-old girlfriend who has adult ADHD. Once I got it and flipped through the pages, I knew how much it would help her in managing her life and couldn't wait until Christmas to give it to her. She agreed and can't wait to get started- I reminded her that she needs to finish studying for finals first ;-)"
5,Indispensable,"For a non-custodial father, this book is tantamount to having a lawyer, a friend and a child-advocate at your becken call 24-7."
5,Totally cute!,I have the same dog that i got from the wee 3 friends set that comes in this toy...I love this set!It's sooo cute and i just can't wait till' X-mas!!I'm a total Barbie fan! Ive loved Barbie toys ever scince i was little.....I'm 12....The Barbie pets are soo well made and sooo cute! Man! Christmas is gonna be soooo sweeeet!!
3,Fair warning,"If hearing ""Who's Looking for Me"" as a sample cut on the February Jazziz magazine sampler brought you here to possibly buy this, fair warning. None of the cuts on the Scott CD rise to that level. Mannered jazz vocal collection, best appreciated by those already familiar with the artist."
4,Well Done,Other reviewers seem to be more familiar with her work than I am but I am glad to have finally made her acquaintance. I was expecting something more along the lines of Dianna Krall but I am not disappointed. It is only the style that failed to meet MY expectations.This is a jazz vocal album. It leans heavily towards love songs and they are well executed. Fans of the genre should be satisfied.
2,Not as impressed as I'd thought I'd be,"I purchased a one-pound fat replica AND a one-pound muscle replica. I truly thought that the differences in the sizing would be more pronounced. I gotta tell you, I really don't see that much of a difference. Theoretically, if you formed the fat into the same shape as the muscle, I'm even less impressed. Maybe these items would be good for someone in the medical field, but I just purchased them for a weight loss motivational factor - gotta tell ya - not a real motivator. I wouldn't purchase again."
4,Om Nom Nom Nom,fatty fat - fat fat. looks like fat but isn't compressible? used it for aversion therapy but found out a trip to the slaughterhouse induced vegan diets much more efficiently.
1,These 35 year old high school students are just awful.,"I wouldn't want to meet a person who thought this movie was funny or enjoyable. I tried to think of a worse film than this and there were only a few that came to mind (REPO: THE GENETIC OPERA is worse I suppose, and perhapsanything directed by Michael Bay). This movie is so insultingly lame. I never laughed at any of the tired gags. There are plenty of breasts and even some gore and from a techincal standpoint the film is competently made but it is really tedious and altogether stupid. The ""teenagers"" look as if they should be teaching high school rather than attending and they exhibit no charm or talent. It fails in every way possible. It's also from 1989 but given slick modern packaging to make it seem more appealing. Make no mistake: this isn't funny, imagainative or entertaining. It's awful. Yuck."
3,For a select group.,"The biggest problem I found watching Monster High was the use of so many non actors.A few of the cast did very well,but the majority of the characters had cleary never performed in so much as a play. Now being what it is, I geuss that's forgivable. The guy playing Armageddon must have had his lines dubbed, and the ""monster"" voice they used was hard to understand at times. Alot of the special effects gags were pretty good. The makeups were okay for a low budget movie like this.This movie is definately for a select group, who eat up weirdness, and silliness.There is some nudity here and there. The bouncing boobs scene is worth the couple of bucks I spent on the movie.I like these kinds of films, but a I know alot of people hate them. But given the choice between watching this & Some SYFY channel cgi garbage...I'd take this!"
1,CLASS DISMISSED!,Lousy HORROR comedy about alien invaders taking over a high schoolattended by the usual sex starved idiots. High school's a badenough experience without all these STUPID teen movies makingthe matter worse! Overall grade...F
1,horrible compared to the other all star comedy jams,"horrible compared to the other all star comedy jams, they should burn all record of this event and pretend it never happened.... waste of time watching it"
2,Filthy Language,"I was shocked/shamed and appalled by the language used in this program. I'm used to hearing foul language in stand-up, but this was ridiculous. I had to skip over the first two comedians completely."
1,Impossibl to understand,Written in Irish dialect with randomly placed punctuation marks throughout has created a literary works that is IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW.It's like reading a story that was written In French by a Mexican and you only read English.
1,Confusion,In what language is this book written? This book could best be described as a word salad...I found it too confusing to read and certainly couldn't determine a theme.
5,A Beautiful Irish Voice,"Jamie O'Neill took ten years in the writing of At Swim Two Boys and, for this reader, it was time well spent. He has crafted a magnificently beautiful tale of two boys in love that expands into the larger world of politics and class and patriotism, just a few among the many ideas shaded throughout this wonderful book. The Irish voice is thick and may prove a challenge for a few pages but the beauty of its poetry will seep into the reader before long and carry one along on its delicious brogue. The reader's Patience is rewarded in this book most thoroughly and thoughtfully. It is nice to read a gay novel that is this rich with so many well-drawn characters, the boys' fathers and the other gay man's aunt, beyond those of the title characters. This novel is a richly written slice of Irish history and about fighting for freedom in all its contexts."
2,A Difficult Read,"I read this book waiting for more to happen romantically between the main characters, but it never developed. Also, before reading the book, one should read up on Irish history. I had no idea what the 1916 uprising was and from the book, it is expected that all readers would know what it was about. I read it & still don't know what that uprising was! It is a slow read with a disappointing ending."
2,Too much effort for too little reward,"The book is ambitious in its scope, but it just doesn't succeed. Reading it became drudgery and I found myself skipping pages just to get to the end... which I never did. I mentioned this to two other friends who told me they couldn't finish the book either. I'm afraid a lot of hype went into this book when it was released, but with time it will be largely forgotten."
3,How long can a novel get?,"At first (the first twohundred pages or so) I really enjoyed this book. But the story just don't suffice for over sixhundred pages.OK, the language is impressing, so for a true linguist this might be a thrill. But for me, a more of a story kinda' guy this book got quite tiresome and a little boring in the end."
5,A Boyish Bond,"Read about the bond between two boys in this historical fiction novel set in the suburbs of Dublin, Ireland."
3,"I wanted to like this book, but.....","Perhaps I was too impatient in reading this book. Perhaps it required more of me than I was able to give it. Another reviewer remarks that it may take a while to find the author's rhythm. I didn't find it. I found it confused, verbose, obtuse and in the end rather disappointing. It contains a beautiful story but it moved ever so slowly toward an ending I knew I didn't want to read. I might add, however, that its ending was indeed a rather good one and a sweet one."
5,Another gay tragedy of yesteryear..,"At Swim, Two Boys is perhaps the second-best book that I have ever read. I do sya that a lot, so it's not necessarily a big deal. Nonetheless, I felt for this work something ethereally real that I have seldom had with other books. It is a whole world that has been created separate from of our. It is a perfectly drawn picture of early 1900's Ireland and the individuals who peopled it.The primary love story between Doyler, Jim, and even MacEmm, was fantastically developed, including the changes of mentality and feeling each had for the other. One felt the emotion exuding from these diverse individuals who made up an untraditional Irish family.The blush of first love, the awe of the loss of innocence, and the serene bitterness against the end of the love of one's life are the scenery that will captivate any traveler who reads this book. Admist all this is the Irish rebellion that led to an independent Irish Republic."
5,Keeps Getting Better,"Christine Feehan has created a series of books that sucks you in and keeps you begging for more. I waited very impatiently for this book and after reading it, it will make it that much harder to wait for the next one. I can only hope that Christine Feehan never runs out of ideas for this series, because I have become a life-long fan."
5,Love Christine Feehan!,"I have read many of Christine Feehan's books and I love them! She has about 20 in this Dark series. I tried to read them in order as much as possible, but it's not really necessary. Each book has a self contained story, with necessary information (from an earlier book) mentioned without retelling the whole book as some authors seem to do.In this series there is a basic story line used in each book and I am amazed at the variety of detail Ms. Feehan includes! I never feel like I'm reading the same story. Her characterization is very detailed and varied. The male lead character in Dark Melody is my favorite.One warning - there are explicit sex scenes in these books, always handled in a loving manner. If that appeals to you, you must check out this series or any other books by this author. Very enjoyable!"
5,A little different from the rest,"I agree with some reviewers that Dark Melody was a little different in the series in that Corrine was pregnant & just widowed not 4 months when she meets Dayan and then they hook up pretty much immediately. In Corrine's defense, she did not love her first husband romantically and wasn't inclined to be with him physically except to try and please him so Dayan did provide that side of life for her..the romantic side. Dayan also seems to be the most passive Carpathian male in the series so far. He is sweet and attentive, a natural daddy type which was perfect for his insta-family. Plus, he never had to ""push"" much because Corrine was accepting of almost everything that went with a Carpathian lifestyle.It was also nice to see a bit of a reunion with other Carpathian couples from past books. I am still hoping to read more about Barrack and Syndil. They seem to be just a thread in several novels."
4,Loved the heroine,"I really liked this one, and it's my first in the series. I plan to go back and start from the beginning. This one grabbed me because in the first chapter you find the heroine with a heart condition, and it really resonated with me."
4,Somewhat disappointed,I was looking forward to reading Dayan's story however I was a little disappointed. I liked the focus about the couple and the obstacles they had to overcome to be together however I hated Lisa's character and the way everyone tried to protect her. It just got a little old. However there is more insight to the Carpathian world as well as a secondary storyline that included Syndil and Barrack. I hope to see them in future books in this series.
5,Dark Melody,"Dark Melody (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 10)I was given one of the later Dark Series books back in April of this year and got sucked in immediately -- no pun intended. I have enjoyed reading every book in the series but I must admit, some of the events in this one brought tears to my eyes. An awesome example of how loved ones will do anything for those they care about."
4,Dark Melody,Really enjoyed this book. It had a surprise. Some of the other books in this series portray that the lifemates can never be physically attracted to any other males. This book was a little different in that regard. Won't spoil it for you.
3,A Good Read,"Dark Melody by Christine Feehan was a good read although not her best work. If you can find this at a good price say a dollar or two then give it a try, otherwise you may want to consider a pass on this one."
3,Let's be honest here...,"This was an adequate Feehan romance - readable, but not one of her best. Why? Not enough sex! Nothing happens until the last few pages. Of course, there's more to a good romance novel than the love scenes, but honestly!"
4,Moving but predictable plot!,"Dark Melody was a moving story but had a predictable plot. I was a tad disappointed (but not much), as a rule I really enjoy this writer."
3,Not the greatest,"Well, I have to say that I have read most of this series and it just keeps getting worse. The dialogue between Corinne and Dayan is insipid. This whole story (and I use that word lightly) could have been told in about 25 pages. If you've read one of the books in this series you've read them all!"
4,I can't wait for more,"When we first encountered Dayan I wondered how long it would be before he showed up in his own book and who his lifemate would be and what she would be like. While I liked the way the lifemates were challenged and the way that characters from previous books were brought in, I didn't really care for the Lisa character. For someone that professed to care so much about Corinne, she was in the way too much.Overall, I loved the book, there were just a few irritants that you have to wade thru to get to the good stuff. And let's start delving more into the reasons why there are so many fertility problems and infant deaths for the Carpathians."
