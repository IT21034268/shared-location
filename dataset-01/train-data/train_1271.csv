5,Pleased,"We were unsure whether we wanted to purchase this product with our BOB but I'm glad that we did. It is nice to have our water bottles (very deep pocket) handy and a pouch (on the small side) to put our keys, phones and binky's in.I recommend getting this product when purchasing a BOB stroller."
3,"required, useful but not great","You need this if you have a double Bob. It's decent quality and does what it's supposed to do but there's a lot of wasted space. They should have had at least one more compartment, maybe somewhere for keys change sunglasses or a larger cup holder or a some better use of the space. Lazy designer made this identical to the one for the single Bob, it's just wider three compartments are the same just spread out.. Also over time it stretches and will sag."
2,Not impressed,"This console is really flimsy. I'm used to real/solid cup holders so find this fairly pointless. The backs of the seats already have nets for holding my keys and cell phone and while it is nice to have water within reach, you could buy a cheaper product that is not ""BOB"" brand that will hold a water bottle."
2,Horrible Audio,"Although I like the stories, the audio on it was horrible. Seasons 1 & 2 were great, but seasons 3-10 sounded very bad. While the characters were talking, there was loud music in the backround. It's hard to tell what they're saying. I had to turn up the volume, but after awhile the music just gets annoying. I love Chespirito and this DVD would have been great if it wasn't for that. That's why I don't recommend this DVD. Just get Seasons 1 & 2."
1,GlassWarePro problems,"The product came congealed and useless. I couldn't get the cap off the can so had to cut it off with tin snips. After opening I saw that the sealant had gotten into the top threads of the cap so this was why I couldn't get the top off. And, like I said, the product was useless as it had set up. I bought this 3 months before I actually replaced my windshield so I had gone past the 30 day return policy offered by GlassWarePro. Frankly, I don't care what the return policy says. If the product is defective from the beginning, the retailer should stand by it. GlassWarePro refuses to stand by their products, so I would be extremely cautious about buying anything from GlassWarePro."
5,great book,"this is the first book i fell in love with. if you are at all interested in spirituality, i would highly recommend it... other books a like are the stranger by camus, forrest gump, on the road and cannery row."
4,The detailed life of a young boy on a mission.,Siddhartha was an eager learner. His adventours leave you not wanting to put down the book. Herman Hesse describes Siddhartha's life as detailed as possible...leaving you plenty of room for you to imagine this young boys dramatic life.
5,A MUST READ-- every three years or so.,"I first read this book almost 40 years ago. Then every few years I would read it again. With the help of this book, I could find myself going through various changes and understand these changes. Friends of mine have done the same thing. If spiritual development means anything to you, then this is a MUST READ-- over and over again.-- Sam Yulish, PhD, author of WHERE HAVE ALL THE HIPPIES GONE? and THE HESITANT PSYCHIC and OTHER STARNGE STORIES."
4,Interesting yet hard to understand. But overall good.,"Siddhartha is very interesting but it is also hard to understand. Unless you are searching for truth like Siddhartha, this book may not interest you as much as if you were experiencing similar struggles. Fairly easy reading and you'll be glad you read it."
4,An inspiring piece about a young man's spiritual search.,"Hesse wrote a book that proves that pantheism is a world view that neglects to explain human nature as we find it, just as much as it explains human nature away. Herman Hesse attempted to present an eastern religion that worked, in this piece he came short of an answer. Siddhartha attempts to break free from suffering and into oneness that his religion forcefully conformed him to. In the novel Siddhartha finds himself in situations of denial, indulgence, and synthesis. All of this in order to realize that life isn't made up of the individual."
4,This book really makes you think,This book chalenges you to think about yourself and how you have been living your own life
3,Ah! The dangers of reviewing a classic...,"This has been on my ""should read"" list for a long time, nearly 20 years.With all of that build up and anticipation you'd think I'd have more thoughts about it than I do. My one word review of the book is 'lukewarm.'It is neither a strong book nor a weak book. Siddhartha's spiritual quest is told in such a detached manner that, in the end, I feel detached from the whole exercise. I am uncommited to the character and I really didn't particularly care where his quest ended up.Perhaps that was the point of it all - it's his quest, you can do nothing but care about your own."
2,Very hokey,"This book is no doubt well written and a quick, easy read. However, I found it to be very hokey. If you are very spiritual and you like the Celestine Prophecy, then you'll probably love this book. If you are practical and down to earth, I don't recommend it. Many reviewers say that this book changed their life. I don't get it. Maybe I skipped a chapter...."
4,I recommend this book.,If you want to read a short novel I definitely recommend reading Siddhartha by Herman Hesse. This novel tells about all the hardships that one man went through to find himself. Siddhartha was not happy until he found the true meaning of life. On his quest for knowledge Siddhartha learns the meaning of love both physically and emotionally. He also learns that life isn't something to be taken advantage of. This book is very toughing and it is easily understood. There aren't many twists and turns so it is easy to follow. Read Siddhartha!
5,AMAZING,For many young adults searching for one's identity and spirituality becomes of great importance and priority. This book shares this expirience and makes the path to finding meaning in life and spirituality and bit easier to trek.
5,A Book That Has Changed My Life,"I had to read this book for a high school English class, and the title itself had intrigued me. I started reading the book right away, and it drew me in with its vivid imagery. The book was poetry in its purest form; the manner in which the words flow and complement each other present the ideas and themes of the book in such a way that it is art. THis novel has made me truly think about life and spirituality. As Siddhartha was awakened, as was I. I recommend this novel to anyone with an open mind and heart."
2,Watch a special on Eastern Philosophy instead,"The breadth with which Siddhartha covers Eastern Philosophy could be conveyed in a Discovery or PBS special. It does not even hint at its own limitations. This serves as an introduction to Eastern Philosophy, but by reading the text one might think they are an expert after finishing it."
3,"a classic- yes, depressing- yes, try other versions instead","This is a classic retelling of the life of The Buddha- the original one. There are other- many other- versions out there.I have always found this treatment to be the most emotionally exhausting version around. That has always seemed terribly inconsistant to me! The Buddha is one of, if not the most, inspiring being to grace our planet. There are the basic facts, but those events lead him to enlightenment- shouldn't a treatment of his life should reflect that? This was one of the earliest versions available to the western audience.In my opinion, that is why it has become a classic; however, there are many versions available today through many of them through various Buddhist orders. I would strongly suggest someone new to Buddhism try one of them instead!"
2,Not as Advertised,Book was advertised as good condition but was actually in fair condition. There was writing and highlighting throughout the book.
5,A thought in time,"This book is great since it was given as a part of high reading list. Talks about how siddhartha came to be and what paths he had to take to become enlightened. Besides reading this book for school purpose, it gave me a better outlook for being a buddhist. So read it if u must for a enlightened feeling."
3,Not a masterpiece!,"I loved HESSE more before I read this book. It is a story, just a simnple story and far away from human reality at least from my point of view. It is full of philosophical discussions about what life should be but I don't think it can be a guide for it.I think that there will always be people who will like this book especially in the west, regarding the spiritual crisis expected to get serious dimensions in the following years, but not suffiecient for pragmatist people.Anyway, not a very bad read."
3,Great story,"This is the best story I've read. However, the brown paper was not the quality I expect."
2,Rather hideous...,"I was assigned this book by my literature teacher, and just by the name I quickly assumed that it would be a slightly tedious religeously motivated book about some fellow from Asia looking for answers. After reaching chapter 5 I didn't find it boring as much as disturbing. The main character, Siddhartha, seems to be soul searching, though his soul searching doesn't seem to involve morals. I was reading out loud to a friend of mine and was quickly shocked to realize that I was reading out loud Hesse's rather graphic description of a somewhat erotic dream of Siddhartha in which his best friend turns into a female. Aside from the fact that Siddhartha is an egotistical snob, he's also rather permiscuous. His constant speaking on how wonderful he is compared to the rest of the ""common ignorant people"" is rather tedious to read. Perhaps it's because I had to read it all in Spanish, though this still isn't a book I'd like to read again."
5,"A must read guide to life, love and harmony",Hesse's Siddhartha is a captivating tale of one man's quest to find meaning in his life. The author weaves a tapestry of life experience that only becomes visible to the reader upon completion... if you are ready for its lessons. The only book with more life lessons is the Bible
2,Not the spiritual epiphany I had hoped,"I had to read this book for my 11th grade english class, and at first I was very excited. From what I had read on this site this book was going to be a very spiritual experrience. It was going to change my life. But the further and further I got into the book the more disappointed I got. This was not what I had expected. The charachters were all extremely shallow, except for Siddhartha. And I found Siddhartha conceited and macho. Two traits I had hoped that Buddha had not had. Maybe I was looking at it from the wrong perspective but I was let down by this book."
5,A fascinating look at one mans journey to enlightenment,"I recieved Siddhartha as a graduation gift. It was one of the best gifts I have ever recieved. I greatly enjoyed the book because Siddhartha is in all of us. We all go through life searching for something, whether physical or in Siddhartha's case more spiritual. It was also very easy to read and understand. One doesn't have to dig deep to find the greater meaning, that's what Siddhartha is doing through out the book. Overall I put it right on the top of my must read list, right next to Dante's Inferno. I would suggest it to anyone."
5,This is THE life changing and affirming book.,This is a book for all seekers. I myself am Siddartha searching for my own river. This book does not tell you what to do how how to see things. It allows us to find our own way and encourges us by showing that we can rise up even when we have forgotten our seeking. My friends who are into finding their own ways also find themselves in this book.
5,The most inspiring novel I have ever read!!!!,"When I read the last word on the last page of this book, I said to myself, ""I am converting to Buddhism"". And that's what I did. I have been touched with enlightenment every day of my life so far. If you haven't read this novel, do so now. It will change your life forever if you look deep into its' meaning. May the great Buddha smile upon you during your reading's. Om!"
4,An enlightening book about finding you place,"Siddhartha, make you feel stupid in a good way. You feel that you really aren't that good of a person. Siddhartha was a meaningful book."
3,Western Introduction to Eastern Philosophy,"Although I can understand the longing to separate oneself from the frustrations and hypocrisy of human life, it does seem like an abandonment rather than an accomplishment to me. Maybe because of this, and because I had been exposed to the tenets of both Buddhism and Hinduism prior to reading this novel, I didn't find it as life-altering and uplifting as many others find it. If you're new to eastern philosophy, this could be a good general introduction."
5,A total inspiration,"I am not a very big reader, but once I started reading Siddhartha, I was hooked. Hermann Hesse wrote it in such a way to express how love and loss, as well as fear, are such an incredible and important part of our lives. Moreover, how knowledge of our own selves is such an essential way to live and to prosper. In many ways, it is my bible. It has all the answers, and all the questions that are worth asking."
5,"if you like what i've written, you'll love what he's written","I read Siddhartha after my second business-a venture-capital backed internet start-up-went bust. As I read this book, I realized I was on Siddhartha's path more than I was on any other human being's path. Since reading that book, I've realized the world consists of people who ""get Siddhartha"" and people who don't.After reading this, I came upon Srikumar Rao, author of Are You Ready To Succeed. His book is the handbook to living the life of Siddhartha. The two books are a source of endless inspiration and guidance."
4,siddhartha gautama,"when my teahcer assigned us to read this book in two weeks i was like no way.but when i got to read it, it was very interesting.the story was good.but at times it was hard to understand what they were talking about, like that stone analogy.but it is a good book to read.it is interesting.i recommend this to everyone out there."
3,Meditation,"The book was a mandatory read for English II honors. The book was slow paced, a different view with Buddasim. I can't say the book was exciting, and it was hard to finish. The book did have good points to it. The end was good."
2,"Very odd, Yet intriguing",I had to read this book for a class and found different from anything else I've read. It tends to be confusing and sometimes rather troubling. I would probably not have read it unless i had to. I am not saying you shouldn't read this book but it just didn't pertain to my interests.
1,Worst Book Ever,I just read this book in my Sophmore English class and it was by far the worst book I have ever read and don't recommend to anyone under 30.
1,Ignorance,"Siddhartha began as a respected Brahaman, then traveled with the samanas for years. He knew how to concentrate, fast, and meditate very well. However, the passages that follow truly show his ignorance. He has an affair, lives a rich, gluttonous, and sinful life, then he has a son that brings him grief. He should have never found interest in Kamala in the first place."
1,"Can someone say ""snooze fest""?","I never would've read this book if I hadn't been assigned it in my 10th grade English class. And I truly wish I hadn't. Really, it's quite awful. For one thing, it is WAY to introspective for me. Am I the only one who thinks that Siddhartha thinks way too much? If he just stopped analyzing everything for one second, he'd realize that all is well, you can be happy. To him the world is a terrible place, until he finally finds peace at age 60. Gee, that took a long time! He was never satisfied and blamed it on the world around him. Get over it!In other words, I've had more fun reading the ingredients on food labels. And they're more interesting too! But I read it and now its done, thank god. In conclusion, if you aren't assigned this book for English class, don't read it!"
1,Oh well.,"This is the worst book I have ever read. And I read a lot. I found it boring, wrong on every level, disgusting and generally not worth the paper it is printed on. Sorry!"
3,Excellent material.,Hesse's greatest work truly is a modern classic. One can get lost in all the spiritualism and also flounder in the philosophicalness of this work. It is a must read for anyone.
5,Amazing Book.,"A very interesting book that tells the tale of searching for enlightenment, a timeless topic, that brought with it lots of understanding and peace. I never read a book that I enjoyed this much! Being sixteen, I feel that this book will continue to influence me for many years to come, the pages old and worn."
3,Siddhartha,Siddhartha is a good book for a reader interested in philosophy as the entire story revolves around what Siddhartha is striving for. Siddharha would also be great to read for one who is interested in eastern religions. Eastern religions (Buddhism and Hinduism) are the basis of the story as Sidhartha tries to discover what organized religion means to him and his pursuit of inner peace.
4,splendid!!!!!,This book helps you think and ponder on stuffs you should do.It has some simple rules of life to make it better and worth.
4,"Good, but by no means Hesse's best","This is Hesse's spiritual book about Siddhartha and the quest to find one's true Self. It pales in comparison to Steppenwolf and Demian, but it is still a very worthwhile read with a vast amount of depth of thought invested into the short book. Resembles Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra in some respects."
5,One of THOSE books you read all of your life,"I'm an old fart but there are two books I've read much of my life. Siddhartha I've read once or twice a year for 50 years and always get something more from it. Now that I'm nearing 70 I read it almost all of the time. The other is ""Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind"" which I've read since the 1970s. I have both books on cassette tape, CDs, and now on my iPOD and Kindle. But get a good edition (like this one) because others are full of typos and wrong words and bad translation."
3,"Beautiful but flawed, as fiction.","I guess a lot depends on how you approach this book. As a fiction, it had beautiful language and images but left me feeling like I was reading an elevated remake of The Pilgrim's Progress.As a work of inspiration, or a companion to one's own spiritual journey, I think it does better. I probably would have appreciated it more had I been in a more spiritual period of life.Overall, as I said, the writing is beautiful, but this is not a book to read simply because ""it is on the list."" I think it has much to offer, but one needs to be in the mindset to receive it."
5,A journey,Siddhartha is a beautiful story that will likely have a profound influence on how you look at the world. It's a philosophical journey into the world of human transformation. Highly recommended.
4,Which Siddhartha?,"Gotama Buddha's original name was Siddhartha, so it would have been better to use some other name for this book and for the Samana who followed his own soul.One very valuable learning from this book is that no teaching can substitute the process of 'learning'."
2,"Almost thought-provoking, but not quite","Siddhartha wanders through life in search of meaning and finally deludes himself into believing that he has found it. The writing isn't that great, maybe it lost something in the translation, and the plot leaves much to be desired, so all this novel has going for it is that it's profound. Almost. Throughout the novel, Siddhartha rejects just about every belief possible, until he decides that the only way to live is to be happy with everything. ""Contentedness with everything is the key to life"" is the only truth revealed in the entire novel, and it is a truth that I do not agree with. I suppose you have to give the guy some credit for punctuation and an honest effort, but I draw the line at two stars."
2,Siddhartha,"Although this book (Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse) is considered a literary classic, this particular translation was very poor with many typos and grammatical errors."
5,You don't have to miss the oportunity to read this one,"Siddartha is not just a big boring novel as many think. Siddartha mixes the greatness of a novel, some mystery, some suspense, some relaxing passages, philoshopy and psychology. If you're interested in search beyond what today's modern society offers, don't miss this supreme piece of abstract full-emotioned philosophy."
4,A Philisophical Classic,"I have never been a huge fan of philosophy, but I can see why this little tome is considered a classic. It is a life's journey and a profound look into the soul. Siddhartha's journey and his desire to be spiritually fulfilled began as a Brahmin's son, then as an ascetic, then into a life of lust and material possessions, and finally into a peaceful life as a ferry driver. With all his outward searching, Siddhartha comes to realize that inner peace is not achieved through lessons from a teacher, or fasting, or worldliness. It is an inward reflection, a recognition of self. This book challenges the ideas of love and nature, among other things."
3,Siddhartha,"Well what can I say... This book was a life changing one. Once touched by it you kind of see the world in a different light. Siddhartha is well written and really does fuel your immagination not to mention it is quite a short book so there fore not that taxing. On the subject matter; I genuinly felt as if (if for only a brief momment) like I had been given small glimpse Of ""Ohm"" just enough to let you see how calm and peaceful the mind really can be. A great story that leaves you feeling humble but content with your place in the world. I recommend this book to any one who is struggling with consequences and pace of modern life :-)"
3,lifetime 4 an answer,Siddhartha is a pretty good and fun book to read. It contain a great storyline where reader themselves by reading this could also learn the teaching about the meaning of life that Siddhartha has gone through. This book shows how a monk would spend his whole life in search of an answer to a question.
1,siddhartha,"I am in the minority compared to the other reviews but I wanted to give a teenager's perspective of this book. I'm 15 and maybe when I'm 30 I'll like the book but I had to read it for an english class in 10th grade and it was awful reading. to anyone who has a choice to read this book or anything else, pick the latter- it drones on and on about siddhartha finding inner peace, exploring different ways of life, and ""discovering himself"". it sends an awful message to kids as he contemplates suicide not once but twice because he is merely unhappy with himself at that moment. there are pages upon pages which are entirely composed of siddhartha talking to himself, then contradicting himself, and so on. in all, the ""action"" in this book could be summed up in about 2 pages and I had trouble staying awake through even the first chapter. if you have to read this, heres a tip: get sparknotes."
1,Not an easy read.,"I picked this book up one weekend last summer, thinking I'd have it read by the following Monday. It looked like a thought provoking book under 150 pages and with a low cost. Well, as I was reading this, the only thought that slipped into my mind was that of sleeping. The language was difficult to understand (I often found myself reading the same paragraph several times, to no avail) and many other confusing factors added to this novel that made me go beserk. It took me almost a month to read this and understand it, and I barely escaped with my sanity."
3,Fun read but yearning for more,"Being a casual go player, I read this book believing that it will lead to a fun go-like read (such as the popular manga -graphic novel- Hikaru no Go). Instead, the title doesn't really do justice to the seriousness of the book, or anything to do with go. Although go brings the two protaganists together, that is the extent to the impact the game has.The book has a fast pace, short chapters, and quick alterings between the two main characters. However, I did not feel a sense of connection between the two, and felt absolutely no sympathy for any of them even after their tragic ends. I felt like the book had a quick ending that could've been made a little better. Overall it had a depressing sentiment about it. If you don't like sad books or books of the nature, then I don't suggest this bdook."
3,Not a bad album....,"I've been a big fan of Bubba Sparxxx since I first heard him years ago....and I have to say I think this may be his worst album to date. I'm not saying the album is bad, but compared to his first two, it's just not as good. Especially in comparison to ""Deliverance"". ""Deliverance"" was a 5 star album...I would say if you are a fan of Bubba's music then buy this album but if not you may not enjoy this to the fullest degree."
4,~(tm),"This CD is great. The beats seem to be done on a professional level. Clean lyrics for the most part. Lots of innuendos, lol. Makes you think. Buy it!!!"
5,Bubba K--represents,"I love Bubba K.'s new cd, ""The Charm"". To me, it is just one of those cd's you put in your player and just let it play. I love the fact that he represents tha' dirty south sound/music so well.Bubba has the talent and skills to maintain. I love the fact that Bubba does not waste his talent dissin' other rappers, musicians, etc. NO. NO. Not Bubba. He basically states in his music, ""I am Bubba. This is what I am about. Let me share this with you"".I love his deep down south accent,his beats, and most of all---his lyrics. My favorite is ""Ms. New Booty"" (and all others) and for a change of pace, I love ""Run Away"".The charm is one enjoyable cd. Everyone and their momma should get a copy (alright. So that is going overboard), but I love that Bubba k!!! ;)*****5 Stars*****"
1,"No Charm here, it's junk","Oh my God will someone tell this country redneck that he can't rap and should go back to pitching hay. This album just plain sucks. There are maybe two songs on here that I thought were decent. Ms.New Booty is a terrible song, so bad enough to make ""My Humps"" look like Tupac. I ain't hatin on Bubba because he's white, I don't like him because he sucks and makes terrible music. Support real white rappers like Eminem and Lil Wyte, hell even John Cena is better. But don't support this redneck idiot because rappers like him, D4L, Dem Franchize Boyz, Mike Jones, Paul Wall, The Yin Yang Twins and other garbage is what is ruining rap. This is one of the year's worst albums and it will surely be on my bottom 10 list."
2,This is whack,"i have heard some good music from this guy but this just anit cuttin it i mean if ya goin 2 come with 11 tracks ya gotta come betta then this (ex. common ""BE"" album). I really think this needs work ie. Mrs. new booty (trash) but if thats what people wanna hear (excluding millions who love real rap) then i guess its kool right?"
4,Great value for the price,Great value for the price. The content was amazing. I had heard of the voice coach (Seth Riggs) but did not know of his broad experience and involvement with so many successfull artists. THANK YOU SETH!
2,"Exercises Only Go Up the Scale, Don't Go Back Down","This teaching method is excellent. With a speech level training teacher I went from not being able to sing to singing in 1 month. I'm not kidding! However, this book is a real disappointment. Although it is great for explaining the method and as an introduction before getting a teacher, you cannot use it to practice with, and here's why: ALL OF THE EXERCISES ONLY GO UP THE SCALE. So, if you want to practice with the CD, forget it. You will still need a piano and will have to know how to accompany yourself."
4,Very good product,"This is a great product for the money and was the icing on the cake for me. I have been introduced to the Speech Level Method from one of his students, Brett Manning, as result what I learned from Mr. Riggs's comments tied up some loose ends. I practice vocal exercises a lot in my car so I would have liked the exercises to go both up and down the scale, rather than in one direction only. That's why I did not rate it 5 stars. But again for the money and if one already has some experience with the method I highly recommend it."
4,Especially great for SLS students on the go,"I don't know that this book alone will make you a better singer, but for any Speech Level student that can't do regular voice lessons, this is a great resource for keeping up with the techniques. It also goes in to more detail with respect to the warmups than your SLS teacher may go."
5,Very motivating,"Bought the book to supplement a 'living teacher', and am not disapointerd in the presentation of the concepts. Honestly, most things are better done with a living teacher, but this is good extra material.Really found the incesant placement of famous people's pictures with their testimonials to be insulting. Name dropping does not a good teacher make unless he/she is teaching name dropping."
2,Not for me...,"Well, I recently received this item. It is totally not for me. Personally what I think, is that this would be for an opera singer that is experienced, but just wants some exercises. The singers that demonstrate the exercises both sing using an operatic voice. They don't even sound good. And they sing the exercises very fast. It is hard to hear the right key they are playing on the piano so you can practice the exercises. The whole thing is too fast. My personal opinion is that it wouldn't be for people that want to sing pop or a style like that. To me, the book consists of two parts. The first part tells you about your voicebox, and the second part goes over the audio CDs. The text just says what Seth Riggs is saying on the audio CDs. I'm going to return it."
5,I saw an improvement the first week!,"I used to sing rock & roll, forcing my chest voice into my head range rather than using my head voice, and had never learned to use my head voice. I always considered myself a contralto and figured my head voice was mostly useless. After just the first lesson with this method I was able to feel the difference between using my head voice and forcing my chest voice up and was amazed at how hard I used to work to hit those notes. Now, four months later, I can actually sing mezzo soprano with quite a bit of ease. I am now able to cross my switch point going up without hanging onto the chest voice, and going down it's become seamless. And I haven't even done all the lessons yet! There are some lessons I am unable to do properly because I have never been able to trill my tongue, but there are enough lessons that muddling past those has not been a problem. I would highly recommend this to ANYONE who has trouble with their head voice and/or their switch point!!!"
4,great with voice lessons,"This book is a great companion to voice lessons from a Speech Level teacher. I'm not sure I would rate it as highly on its own. It has only two cds with not that many lessons, so once you can do most of them it becomes boring and monotonous to do the same few exercises over and over.I've heard that Brett Manning's book is better but I haven't bought it, since it's so expensive. For the price Seth's book is definitely a good buy though. I would just recommend taking lessons as well with it."
5,Best Book/CD combo for teaching yourself...,"Excellent book and CDs to teach yourself. He is TOTALLY right about most classical teachers telling students to do 25 different things at once. My classical teacher tells me so many things do to that I end up tensing up and making everything worse. SLS is the exact opposite...says that resonance, support, etc. will occur as a byproduct of singing in a relaxed speech like manner. Worked much better for me than trying to think about resonating in certain areas, placing vowels, support, etc. Definitely worth it....at half the price of a lesson."
3,Not A Beginner's Vocal Development Course,"This course helps with two areas: smoothing out the transition in your voice and assisting you vocal cord abduction in your middle and upper register. The potential problem is that some of the exercises, such as the edgy hum, will tighten your vocal cords too much and cause strain. You are basically pressing your cords together to ""catch"" the note and the open it up on the vowel. So yes, as a baritone, you may learn to sing a vowel on high C, but you will pay for it later. And it overly devalues the importance of breathing - in essence you are singing from the neck up. It has value as a potential refinement of an already experienced singer, but not as a first choice of learning to sing. Most, if not all, of those singers used to promote the author would be Grammy winners anyway. Did Caruso use these methods? Ella Fitzgerald? Sam Cooke? There are no short cuts."
1,Pass this book up,"The biggest problem this book has is that it is not very broad. These few exercises that encourage a larynx at the position of speech have two main problems. First, we don't sing with our larynx at the position of speech. Second, these exercises may encourage the frozen, and/or compressed larynx that is not a quality of either speech or, and more importantly, singing.A good vocal pedagogy education shouldn't be needed for anyone to see that this book and Speech Level Singing fall way short of an actual useable ""method."" In fact, when we voice teachers no longer get former Speech Level Singing students in to our studios that need to be retrained, I'll be more than happy to revisit my opinions on this book and SLS.If you are looking for higher quality books/CD/DVDs, check out such authors as Gillyanne Kayes's Singing and the Actor, or Lisa Popeil's books CD/DVDs, and Elisabeth Howard's Book/CD/DVDs Sing!"
5,Singing Agail,Enjoying singing again even as I am retired Its a good product and easy to follow along recomend if your wanting to freshen up on your singing
5,Excellent,"Im very happy to receive my book and the 2 cd's. Very good book, well presented. Good teaching. Help with my voice training . Well done."
3,user friendly,"great method with a great explanation of how it should work. demonstrations were superb, but is was set up kind of random in it's arrangement of exercises. the 'how to' isn't really clear and i just don't find it very user friendly. also, it seems to not recognize any teachers outside of his ""associates"" listed in the front of the book. i've found fantastic teachers who produce great results outside this method. i find it very arroagant to not recognize any teachers in any other method just because you all feel like you have ""the truth."" great method, but not the only method. i also think there is more to singing than just finding a 'connected voice.' very narrow in it's vision and somewhat incomplete. overall, a good addition to one's pursuit of vocal excellence."
4,singing for the stars complete program,I was very happy with this product it arrived in good condition and took only 2 weeks to arrive. it was well packaged.
5,Indespensible Book,I got the book right away because my old one was so well used. It comes with two cd's This is the singer's best friend!
2,Unusable for people without extensive background,"I found the CD unusable because of the speed of the exercises. A friend to whom I gave the book had a similar experience -- frustration, boredom, no results. I had high hopes for this product when I bought it, but I have gone back to Roger Love's book (Set Your Voice Free). I understand that he was a student of Riggs, and perhaps that is the source of his ideas; but I at least found his book much, much more usable. I have taken singing lessons since then from a professional voice coach, and I must say that her approach (which has given me excellent results) is a lot more accessible than Riggs, as well. So, if you are a semi-professional singer with years of experience and the ability to sing very fast scales, this book may be quite useful. For other people, I would say strongly: give it a miss."
3,Find A Seth Trained Level 5 Instructor Instead...,"This course doesn't even come close to working with one of his trained coaches. No where near the same results that even 1 hour with one can get you.However, his METHOD is the ONLY one that has had me achieving an increase in my range the FIRST time I used it.In fact I worked with a vocal coach for over a year before I learned of Seth and I can tell you that the work with that coach was a waste of time. My voice was shot after EVERY 30 minute session.Not with Seth's approach.I thank Seth for ending my search for a method that not only improved the quality and tone of my voice, but my range.Find a Seth trained master coach. You'll be thankful you did."
2,Too Many Details,Having a hard time finishing this book. Too many details and not enough application. I couldn't grasp the point with all the apartment shapes changing where the lucky corners are I just can't figure out how this helps me decorate my studio apartment.
4,Cthulhu Meets Computers,"To my intense surprise and delight, Cthulhu 2000 proved to be a pretty good collection of highly diverse tales, a fair number of them good-humored send-ups that I was almost embarrassed to admit I found myself laughing with - my favorite being ""Love's Eldritch Ichor,"" a very funny piece about a descendant of the Old Ones and a book editor falling in love in a Lovecraftian mansion a la The Addams Family, which, believe it or not, is a lot better than it sounds.But I was even more surprised at the collection of legitimate horror stories, some as genuinely creepy as anything Lovecraft ever penned himself. Not all the stories are strictly Lovecraftian by connection, but most are essentially true to his overriding theme of cosmic terror. Don't expect straight Lovecraft, and you might find yourself really loving this book. I did."
4,A very nice HPL anthology,"Recently I have beed disappointed by a number of HPL-inspired anthologies. This is an exception. Although I have read a few of the selections in other anthologies, this is a fine collection of Lovecraftian works. ""The Barrens"" is one of the finer works within the covers and the work at large is assembled with a fine eye towards what HPL would have considered appropriate sequels. Any collector of Cthuluesque lit will find Cthulu 200 a fine read."
3,Making Cthulhu your own.,"As a collection of supernatural horror stories Cthulhu 2000 succeeds quite well. But the ""Cthulhu"" in the title is something of a mistake. This isn't real Cthulhu for various reasons (story one is too blunt with descriptions, story two is far too humorous - moreover it underlines the ""frogs chanting ""IA!"" line in the book's introduction), and by posing as Cthulhu it destroys the charm of the original. By glancing at what the authors fancy to be the underpinnings of Cthulhu, you make it closer to yourself, endowing it with motives and an understandable course of action. I especially hate ""Pickman's Modem"" because it manages to give Cthulhu a humorous side. After reading Cthulhu 2000 I went back and read The Color Out of Space in the middle of the night. It had no impact whatsoever on me. Read this book at your own risk."
3,Cthulhu 2000,"If you are going to buy this book because you think the stories even come close to Lovercraft, do not buy this book! The stories in this book are so boring and they just captialize on all of Lovecraft's idea's. None of them have the werid, horrorific mood that Lovecraft usually sets in his stories. Some of them shouldn't even be called stories, just ""book fillers"". Overall I was very disappointed with this book because I thought the stories were good, but weren't. For everybody else, if you like Lovecraft, then stick to the master's tales, no offshoots."
2,attempts collection,"this collection contains some stories that are almost good (wolfe, copper, wilson, campbell) but in the end are not good enough. i like good pulp. it's not here. some of the stories are really strangely uninteresting. kind of author-is-trying-to-be-inventive, and creates a story i am not impressed by."
4,Good snips but . .,Sure wish I could find the USA made ProSnips.Supposedly the same but my USA 10 inch oneswork way better. I WANT MY MADE IN USA!
2,Just OK,"I saw a reference to this book in another book that I rather liked, so I thought I'd check it out. Nothing wrong with it, just nothing new with it, either, and it took its sweet time getting to the point."
5,"So far, so good!","I just started reading this book, it seems pretty interesting...will know more soon. I would recommend it so far! Go for it!"
4,Very nice if you like this genre!,"I picked up a copy of ""These Small Rooms"" when I worked at an alternative rock radio station, and although that station had no business playing this disc, any lover of great folk music certainly does!Deborah's sound is simple, her voice golden, and her lyrics poignant. This album is vaguely reminiscent of Ani Difranco's first few releases. ""Hey Lady"" is definitely the album's highlight...It's a great, mellow disc to listen to while you're in bed at night, alone or with company. I'm really looking forward to seeing what Ms Bartley does in the future."
3,Better live,"I saw Les Ballets Trockadero live and they were amazing. This video, however, is not of a very good quality, so their amazingness is harder to see on the DVD. I was disappointed that the videography wasn't more professional."
3,Broken voice,This concert starts out pretty nicely and you can feel the enthusiasm of the audience. I am not a huge fan but I have enough respect to have bought the DVD and I enjoyed what I saw and heard until the point Oakley's voice gives out. A bad moment (he makes a comment that they'll edit it out for the DVD but of course they don't). For the remainder the concert limps along and you feel as though you are getting a reduced version of what could have been. I sold this off for half price after one viewing. My recommendation is to just rent it from netflix.
2,not a good production,"if you're a fan of human league,then I strongly recommend that you keep looking for another DVD/concert.poor quality on both the sound and the video.don't say you wern't warned."
5,Good stuff.,"This CD is positively brilliant! I had the chance to see a lot of the band live when I was in Galway (it was Reeltime, I saw Trad on the Prom) but the show I saw also included Mairin Fahy, Yvonne Fahy and Chris Kelly, so I bought this CD, because I knew it had to be good. I was not disappointed. Excellent CD."
4,"Charming, simple drawings","I purchased How to Draw Wizards, Dragons and Other Magical Creatures for my 8 year old daughter, who is interested in drawing, but isn't necessarily gifted in this area. Each page contains four steps to create a simple line drawing. The pictures are charming, yet simple; there is no shading involved, for instance. My daughter had no trouble creating her own drawings by following the sequential drawings in the book. There are no written prompts, but you really don't need them. I recommend this for children between the ages of 6 and 10. Older children would probably find these drawings too simple."
4,Decent cheap phone,"Cheap phone - works great for what it is. Time will tell to see how it stands the test of time, but so far, it works ok. For 14 dollars, I hope you don't expect a Polycom, but I'd rather have this then a grandstream."
1,THIS BOOK JUST SHOWS YOU REALLY CAN'T BUY CLASS!!!!!,"I used to be a Tara fan, but this book promotes exactlly what changed that. It's lack of depth and insight would insult even a third grader. In a nutshell, this book might as well be full of empty pages because that exactlly the picture it paints of Tara's brain. This book distorts any since of feeling this girl has, except for her obbession with Disney World. Is she a skater or a cardboard cut-out?"
2,skating on thin ice,"Book does read like written by a 14 year old. Very shallow. Doesn't really go beaneath the surface. So i guess we learn that she likes going to Disneyworld. Compare this to Kwan's Heart of a Champion where she goes beyond her favorite food, favorite music. etc. etc. etc. if this was a skating event, i'll give it a 2.5!"
2,Not the Greatest....Time for A New Re-Write?,"I agree with previous reviewers that the book did not read all that impressively and does come across as rather childish and 'fluffy'. Now that Tara is older, I think it would be great for her to perhaps re-write this book, almost into an entirely different book, maybe contrasting her new pro life with her amateur career, with her insights into both."
5,Tara's life couldn't of been told better than this!,"If you all are Tara fans, like myself, I think you will enjoy this wonderfully told story about how she started skating , and where she ended up! There are several colored pictures from when Tara was a tot to now! Although , for a more updated version about her now, read the awesome new boigraphy , Totally Tara. Don't foget to read her books!!!"
1,"Fluff, fluff, fluff","This is a very shallow book, you can tell it was written by a 15 year-old! She always uses the term's ""excellent"" and ""great"". This is a must-not have."
1,"If you can spell ""bad"", you're too old for this book","As a fan, it pains me to say this, but I wish I had read it at the bookstore instead of spending money on it. I finished it in what seemed like minutes, and didn't gain any insight into her life. Fans won't learn any more about Tara than you already know. Two thumbs down."
2,Tara Lipinski writes like a child.,"Tara's book was written for a child. It seems as though she did not put any real thought into her book. She should get some pointers from Michelle Kwan, who's book, HEART OF A CHAMPION, was exeptional. It was not only interesting, but it was also humorous."
3,Italian words and sounds,This book contains Italian words that are identified by the sounds they make. I think it can be a confusing to decipher and remember the Italian words this way. Each word is taught in isolation rather than in the context of a sentence or converstaion. Some of the words are also not very useful for conversational Italian.
2,Go Buy Space Empires IV or V Instead.,"If your looking for a good 4x space conquest game then this game is NOT it. I strongly recommend that you go buy Space Empires IV or V (released just last month) and enjoy them.RFTS came out in 2000 and I was one of the first people to buy this horrid game. It look great on paper but after about 20 minutes of playing it I found that I simply just wanted to uninstall it and go back to playing Moo2 or Stars. But I stayed with the game, played it through to the end of what can only be consided a comapain, and then unistalled. I found MOO3 to be a better game than this, and that is saying a lot. (Moo3 was one of the worst game ever made IMHO.)In a nut shell, you will be better off if you buy SE IV or V (Or both as both are very good games) than if you spent your hard earned gaming money on this less than stellar attempt at 4x gaming."
1,this bagel holder is too wide and low,This aesthetically pleasing wood bagel holder is dangerously wide and low so the bagel is not firmly held upright. This creates an unsafe cutting situation especially for kids. I do not recommend this prodect.
4,Clever design,I eat bagels at least 3 times a week and it gets tricky when trying to slice one. I went searching for a inexpensive solution and found it in the Bagel Miter. The bagels that I buy are large and fat and they fit fine in the miter.
2,not very helpful for my bagels,"This item looks pretty on my shelf where it will probably remain until I have a yard sale. The opening isn't large enough to hold our ginormous local bagels (I wish they sold the size the device is designed to hold, but that's another review.) And if I do manage to stuff all that bagel into the device, it just doesn't secure the bagel well enough to permit a clean easy cut. Yeah it's probably better than holding the bagel in your hand to slice it and risking a trip to the ER, but if you can bear to have yet another plastic thing and can afford it, go with a bagel guillotine."
5,Ironwood Gourmet Acacia Wood Bagel Miter,This was a gift and he uses it daily. The only thing that I would do differently is to have it deeper or taller so that the bagel can be started easier. Otherwise excellent product and shipping
3,good enough,"However, it is easy to overshoot and cut the wood instead of the bagel. It works fine if you are careful and slow."
1,save your $$,"Knife does not line up with both sides of the cutting slot (checked the knife and the slot, they were both straight). It is necessary to hold the bagel until the knife cuts all the way down to the slot (leaving you at risk for cutting your fingers.I notified Amazon and got an instant refund...I love Amazon!!"
3,Using the Bagle cutter,"Works reasonably well, however with a cold bagle it does not fit firmly enough to cut with ease.It would have been ideal if that handle to hold it with adjusted the one side so the bagle could beheld in place. I purchased the plastic knife with it, and it seems to work ok."
4,Bagel holder,It cuts the bagels straight down the middle. Can not hold the handle though or else the bagle will come out of the holder. Have to hold the whole holder while cutting the bagel.
1,Bagel cutter,"I bought two of these last year. I thought they'd be great, however, when I used it, gave the other to a friend for Christmas, I had to physically hold Bagel then cut it. The last bagel cutter I had was higher on the sides and I went back to using it even though it's old,worn and ready to be thrown away. I should have returned the two I bought but had given one away and used the other, but not happy whatsoever. It was also rather pricey for the quality. First time I've bought something on Amazon I didn't care for."
1,Useless product,Does not hold the bagel in place at all. I had to put my hand in all possible positions to hold this and the bagel in place; and ended up injuring my finger in the process.
3,"very pretty, not so practical","I got this with the bagel safety knife. I like that this looks good sitting out on the counter. But the bagel moves around too much in this holder, and the knife producd far too many crumbs. Perhaps nice for adults and a sharp knife, but was a poor decision for my needs (kids). Ended up getting a bagel guillotine which works great."
3,It is what it seems to be,This device does help with cutting a bagel into two halves butone still has to hold the bagel most of the time. It serves toseat the bagel while one holds it and cuts it.
4,A Simple Tool,"My wife loves this product! She hasn't cut her fingers since she started cutting bagels in half using this tool. I would recommend producing a higher tool so the bagel seats deeper, making the knife fit the into the slot easier."
5,Excellent study of a fine film,"This is an excellent addition to the BFI series on landmarks of cinema. The film will not be well-known to American audiences, but it is a particularly popular film in the UK. Houston looks at the film from several angles including the production and politics of the film era.She is also a very good and balanced film critic. She actually seems to like films and her enthusiasm for this film is infectious. Even though I had just seen the film, I went back and watched it again and she opened my eyes to some important scenes and ideas in the film. In particular, the jump from suspense to horror as the villages see the threat emerging.I only hope that this book will make this film more widely known."
3,size charts?????,This item is in infant toddler sizing not regular childrens sizes. I bought a Med for my 5 year old son and I couldn't even salvage the purchase and use it for my 3 year old son it was too small. Every other soccer outfit we have is size small and fits my 5 year old right now. The quality of the product seems good although I did not get to test it at the field.
4,Great Kids' Game,"It's hard to find an age appropriate game these days, but this one fits the bill. For older kids, the first few games might seem a little boring, but as they continue to play it becomes more challenging and fun."
2,Didn't pull me in at all,"Poor graphics. The only option for multiplayer is the lame competitions which you can barely see (due to the poor graphics). So boring, not enough of a challenge. A real shame because I usually like these Shrek games."
4,SHREK,I FOUND IT HARD BUT GRAND KIDS HAD NO PROBLEM WIT IT UNTIL THE WITCH. KIDS FROM 4 ON UP DO BETTER THAN I DO.
2,Not very good..,I was really disapointed after everything I read about Strobel's first book. Not a total throw-away but I've definatly read better. Not recomended.
3,Not convinced,"I am a Christian, but Strobel uses weak evidence to prove that Jesus was the son of God. His reasoning is comparable to saying anyone who wears a dress is a woman. Although this book is good at convincing those who know little of Christianity, history and other religions, its fails with those more educated. Honestly, I am surprised that the evidence he gives was able to turn him from a blazing athiest into a Christian.He says that Christianity is the one faith that entrance into heaven is based on beliefs, not deeds. This is just not true.Also, he uses passages in the Bible to validate certain truths - that is like using my 8th grade diary to prove that boys are jerks. Sure, Strobel attempts to prove the validity of the Bible, but without strong evidence.Overall, this book is great for youngsters or the naive, but any real athiest will mock the contents."
1,Work of fiction.,"The ""true"" Jesus speaks:""Think not that I [Jesus] have come to send peace on earth: I come not to send peace, but a sword."" (Matthew 10:34)""But those mine enemies which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me."" (Luke 19:27)If you believe that a cosmic Jewish Zombie who was his own father and killed himself to save us from himself can make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh and telepathically tell him you accept him as your master, so he can remove an evil force from your soul that is present in humanity because a rib-woman was convince by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree you might want to see a doctor."
4,I always like this opera.,"The arena is impressive and the scene is new. I prefer the old way but the modern way is not bad.Nucci and Machado are good. I enjoyed ""La Donna e mobile""Rigoletto is always good to see and hear."
5,"Fabulous opera, and performance","I've become a great fan of TDK operas, with their wondeful color. Rigoletto is, of course, simply a great opera, Verdi's best, in my not so humble opinion. The opening scene of the hunchback's sadness could break any one's heart. Everything was well done, with repeats of the ""avenge' aria and. of course, 'Donna mobile"" Maybe there's one better, but this DVD completely satisfied me."
1,Avoid!,"This is a book which is not worthy of serious consideration. Author, tries to darken middle ages even rinascimento as possible for the sake of lighthen the star of Leonardo. There are many unconvincing and poor arguments(!). I do not mention its non-exist, bad bad bad bibliography scattered in notes. Throughout the book, the author shows his ignorance of renaissance, science, art, middle age, history of since etc."
2,Tabloids from the 16th century!,"While Micheal White's book does serve as an interesting introduction to some of the biographical history of the iconoclastic Leonardo, White includes so much subjective narrative following up the context of each chapter that he turns the ""total man"" goal of his study into a hyperbolic and titillating read that could very well have been lifted from the ""Milanese Inquirer"", if such a tabloidic rag existed so long ago! Hey, it probably did! But do we have to pay [money] for a ... Italian rag? All right, I'm no writer, but I would hate to have read this book as cliff note version for class and then had my semester grade riding on the final exam. If this is what you're thinking, don't do it! Leonardo would thank you if he could..."
2,Scientist? Homosexual?,"Michael White spends more time trying to use very tenuous evidence to ascertain whether or not da Vinci engaged in sex with other males than he spends trying to convince us that da Vinci should be classed as scientist. What is the purpose of this effort? Does da Vinci become a more credible scientist if White convinces us that da Vinci can be classed as a homosexual? In attemtping to convince himself and his readers that da Vinci would fit into either class -- scientist or homosexual -- White pursues a useless game. Why not simply tell us of the very superior insights that da Vinci achieved in his explorations and let us revel in the man's astouunding creativity. And, who cares about da Vinci's sex life? What difference could it possibly make relative to his creativity?"
2,A reincarnation of his previous works,"I will not claim that whatever Mr. Weiss has experienced is not true. But from the perspective of originality and evolution of its teachings, this book does not include anything that he has mentioned in ""Many Lives Many Masters"". Actually this book seems to be the consequence of some pressure from his editors to come up with another work, so suckers like me who liked the previous ones, will fall in the same old merchandising trap which sequels are.I do not believe that Mr. Weiss requires more money from royalties. So I do not know what moved him to write such a lame book of which he must be aware is just a blend of his previous work ""reincarnated""."
4,easy to read,"The book is easy to read, but so are most of the Eastern teachings that contain the simple truths. Compare it to Lao Tsu's writings. Same messages, but hard to really ""get"", and harder to live."
3,Christmas gift,Also Christmas gift to my second daughter's family. The books of Mr. Weiss are very readable and the subject is interested.
2,A far cry from his original best seller,"I have read three of Dr. Weiss' books on the subject of reincarnation. In my opinion, this book is opportunistic."
5,The best that I have read,"I thought this book was wonderful. It was so well written, and after reading it I don't believe my life will ever be the same. This book put into words everything that our spirits have always known. You have to try this one."
5,"Amazing Book, Wonderful Message","This book is wonderful. Besides the fact that it is easy to read, it just gives you such a new perspective on life and why we are here. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to open their horizons on this lifetime, those in the past, and the future . . ."
1,No love for this book,"After wasting my time reading over 50 pages, I am convinced this one of the worst books on this subject .I have no doubt in my mind that none of this was a true story(which is legal).You can clearly see by how badly it is written that it is a book written by someone with a gift for ""story telling"". Anyone could make this up. This was truly a complete waste of time and paper. I would give it zero stars if I could."
4,Great book - but only if you've alraedy read the others...,"Dr. Weiss is an excellent writer, and his books are top priority for anyone wishing to know the basics of rebirth, and ultimately the meaning of life! But If you don't start with ""Many Masters, Many Lives"", and then follow on to ""Only Love is Real"", you'll just think he is just another ""New Age Pseudo-Guru""... Here, Dr. Weiss goes even deeper on the findings about the simple and powerful meaning of Love, in the ""cosmic"" sense, and anyone interested in some easy-to-understand instructions should read it. By the way: This one was issued FIRST here in Brazil (about six months ago!)"
4,QUITE A LOVE TAP!!,"Having made ""past-life regression"" a household word, this author has courageously taken another step toward raising the consciousness of his readers. He seems to be saying now, past life information is of value, but don't linger there-- take the data you discover about who you ""were"" and apply it to today. Stay in the moment, live in the ""here and now""; face today's issues knowing you have help from a universal life force. The book is filled with anecdotes, familiar universal truths, concepts and tips on love, compassion, inner peace, harmony and balance; all the more meaningful because of Dr Weiss' scientific, analytical background and training. He invites us to explore the power of love, and the existence of Masters, spiritual guides. ""So what is your purpose and why are you here, this lifetime?"", asks the author. A worthy addition to his previous books. I enjoyed, ""Many Lives, Many Masters"", and this latest book is equally fascinating."
2,I was disipointed,"I was disipointed in this book, however I blaim myself for not reading who designed the designs of the illustrations.I was under the impression that the word original ment by F.L.W's originals. The illustrations are all very nice, however they lack color suggestions and any hint of where they may have been used."
4,Prairie Designs for Stained Glass Windows,"I am a fan of the Arts and Crafts Movement in the United States, as exemplified in Mission and Prairie designs. I used this book to assist me in designing tile and mosaic murals using themes from the Arts and Crafts period. With a little time, a copy machine, and some colored pencils, you can make some original designs for use in your own home or business."
4,"Very expensive, but worth every dime if you need it","If your baby has protein digestion problems this is a Godsend. When switching from breast to formula at six months my son started throwing up, not spitting up but throwing up and the broke out in a rash. They switch him to every kind of formula until the discovered he had allergies including milk and soy. Once he was finally moved to this and we removed any other allergin causing items from his diet he began to gain weight and thrive again. He is back to his normal playful self and even though the price is a killer its worth every dime if your child needs it to be healthy. Be sure to check with Mead/Johnson. Families who must use Nutramigen receive one free case. I found this out through their sales rep at my pediatrician and we did receive a free case. It was a nice gesture on their part considering you'll spend about $100 a month on this formula."
2,Didn't work for my son,"I have a two month old who has been on a bunch of different formula's, so this was the ped's final suggestion. I've read so many wonderful reviews on how it ""saved"" people's babies. Not mine. He is usually gassy, but on nutramigen, he started spitting up chunks and projectile vomiting - he was actually much worse, he cried everytime we patted his back to burp him, or even sat him upright. He was okay on it from day 3-6, but after that he was bad."
2,"Easy to Install, But Not Really Private","We installed the 6' ft gray version of Max-Slats. While easy and quick to install, they provide very little privacy. Each slat blocks about 90% of each vertical gap line in the chain link fence, but that leaves 10% on each side. When lined up together, that is about a 20% gap between each slat. We regret not returning the items and looking for something more solid. Hugely disappointed in the coverage of this product."
5,Worth the money,Installs in minutes or keep it loose to change from car to car. Great way to get peoples attention. I use the bull horn to call my dog when he wanders off. A few elephant screams or dolphin calls usually brings the slow wandering teen kids hurrying to the car after school to avoid further embaressment. All in all quite good entertainment with all the different sounds and songs. You can even record yourself. For the $30 it cost it is well worth the money to me.
4,"Works well,wish it was a little better quality","I have it installed and it works just as its described. Very cool how you can listen to each sound from the mic before choosing to play it on the loud speaker. It always surprises me how they can not better describe and provide directions for a company product.Over all it does as it says, seems to be made pretty well and the sound is fine if you don't turn it up real loud.Many of the sounds sound terrible no matter what volume, you will have to figure out which ones you like and stick to them. It needs a better quality and more powerful speaker, I looked every where for one of these and they don't seem to make them. I think for a unit that has many sounds to pick from this is the best out there. I may buy a better speaker someday, will have to see how long the mic lasts."
1,not loud,it was a good product funny and all but the horn isnt loud at all you can barley hear it and the pa is so low you cant even hear it inless you are out of the car lame
4,"Okay, so it's a little juvenile.","But I love this movie. I think maybe you need to be a game geek to get it, but if you get it, you'll laugh until your sides hurt.After watching Allen Covert in so many Adam Sandler movies I was skeptic that he could carry a movie on his own. But the grey bush pulled it off.It's low-brow and juvenile, but still a riot.If you are NOT a gamer, you might want to pass. If you are looking for intellectual stimulation, again pass. But this movie a great way to spend a couple hours laughing at some over grown kids living a life many many gamers can only dream of."
2,Not what I expected out of Amazon!,"I never wrote a bad review because I have been satisfied with Amazon for some time now. But the picture of the DVD featured a slip cover and I recieved my copy without it. Also it got ""lost in the mail"" and Amazon had to resend it which was fast but it was now a late birthday gift for a friend so I couldn't return it, it was late enough! And like I wrote, it came without the box cover. So beware of the false picture of the DVD!"
2,Grandma's Boy,I thought this movie would be hilarious. It has great veteran actress' in it. I was thoroughly disappointed with the movies drug and sex theme. It wasn't funny except in a couple spots.
5,Please Sit On My Face!,"A very unrated and overlooked comedy produced from the Happy Madison Camp. If you understand English or like video games in any sense you should own this dvd. Very open criteria.Its silly humor, great characters and jokes aimed at the lives of lonely, virginal video game developers is worth watching over and over again. You don't have to smoke pot to enjoy this movie and JP is worth the price of this movie.BUY THIS!"
4,So dang funny,"I gave this a 4 star rating because I just love this movie. When life is closing around me this movie can have me laughing in just a few minutes. I have been a fan of this movie for so long and my first copy was stolen so as soon as I had the chance to buy it again I did. If you love stupid movies this is the one for you, it is not as bad as some of the super stupid movies and has an almost believable story line. Watch it if you want a good laugh."
3,"A bit hokey, but some laughs....","Yes, some old humor is there, but there were a few chuckle out loud moments. Disk number two has a couple moments too! Caution...This unrated version may not be appropriate for all ages!"
2,it was ok,"i wasn't blown away by it,but it had some moments. it made for a alright weekend film.Shirley Jones had me laughing. this film had alot of cliches some worked&some were misses. some laughs here&there."
1,Lame,"This is the lamest movie ever made and released. There are a couple of funny parts, otherwise it is overgrown boys smoking pot and playing video games. It is not even funny like Harold and Kumar movies. Save your money and your time."
2,Horrible and not at all funny,2 stars for Doris Roberts. This movie was truly horrible. A great commercial for pot smoking though.
4,Grandma's Boy,"This will have you laughing through the whole thing. If you are in the mood for a good laugh, this one won't let you down!"
4,"Funny, Funny Film",Grandma's Boy is a funny (and sometimes gross) movie that is worth owning if you liked the earlier Adam Sandler films. It might not be your thing if you're not into gaming (like my girlfriend) or into gross-out humor (like my girlfriend).The story is solid and the extras on the DVD are okay.
3,This movie is sooo funny!,"This movie is a riot. I've watched it over and over, and it just gets funnier. Some may find the ""crude"" humor offensive, but personally, I think it's one of the best stoner movies of all time!"
5,I love this movie!,"Arrived sooner than expected, always a big plus for me! Great price, brand new, and as one of my favorite movies, i'm glad I can now add it to my movie collection! :)"
4,Video games pay....sometimes,Some classic one liners and awkward moments with an action figure. You get to see the old under dog 1 up his competition and grandma saves the day. There is a drug dealer who's a bit daft as well.
5,"Very, Very funny","This is one of my favorite comedies in my very large movie collection.I just bought another to give to my Brother, as the version that playson cable, dish, etc. is chopped up and what is left is hardly worth watchingas this is an ADULT film, and not for the kids or any one who does not livein the real world.For someone who went to VietNam and lived and got stoned through the 60's, 70's,Etc. this movie hits home and is as real as it gets.If your not a cynic, or someone that cannot see beyond their own beliefs, thenyou will probably enjoy this film."
5,Excellent Show!!!,"NOT FOR KIDS, but a very funny and very fun movie!!! I laughed alot thru this thing... eighteen, nineteen, twenty."
5,FUNNY!,This is absolutely one of the most quoted movies EVER made! I laugh out loud EVERY time I watch it. HAHA!
4,Laugh out loud funny,"While not a high class comedy, this movie hits all of the right funny points and should become a college cult classic.A 35 year old beta tester (Allen Covert) finds himself in a unique living situation trying to impress his boss surrounded by a lot of pot smoking characters.Certainly a must see if you want a good laugh. Same production group that does all of Adam Sandlers movies, although a different twist since Covert is the star (appearances by some of the Sandler regulars)."
5,"too stupid for adults, great for teenagers","grandma's boy is definately the funnyest movie i have seen this year, and last year too probably, with the possible tie with The Longest Yard, also a adam sandler film. grandma's boy is the story of a man who is living the teenage gamer's dream, except with the living with his grandma. the constant vulgar sexual induendos and simple jokes, some how come together to make a hilariously stupid film. it jokes about what the teenage comunity does (i can testify for that) and it does a damn good job of it. the relations to sex, drugs and alochol in a hilarious way is somthing a teen can relate to, and half the time just say out loud ""that is so true."" only thing that this movie currently dissapoints me with, is that there is no DVD release date yet, which i plan to buy this DVD the day it comes out, or maybe download if im in a money crunch then,a definate ""grandma's boy"" move."
2,Not that funny.,"I will start by saying I LOVE Nick Swardson. But I did not find this movie funny at all. Maybe it's because I no longer smoke weed. I did not find this movie funny in the least. His character Jeff was the best by far, but that isn't saying much unfortunately."
4,"Same jokes, but a fresh feel","Although it has basically the same dirty adolescent jokes about sex, pot, [...], etc, this 'Adam Sandler movie' without Adam Sandler goes back to the old early-90s humour we used to love from Adam and his gang. There are some extremely witty lines and comebacks, as well as colourful characters with whom you can sympathize. I'd be waiting a long time for another movie that focuses on video games and marijuana and the time has finally come."
4,It was great,What can I say? The movie was really great and funny and the fact that it was uncensored let them cut loose just a little bit more and gave it more laughs
4,My favorite movie,"The only reason I gave this four stars was because it didn't come with the cardboard over-cover as shown which I actually wanted with this. As this is my favorite movie, the movie itself gets a sure fire 5 of 5 but as I'm rating this product, it didn't live up to what was shown."
4,Not as funny as I remember..,"The movie itself was not as funny as I remember it being the first time I watched it years ago, but that may have to do with the change in age (sigh). Overall though, the purchase was what I expected. No complaints about the sender."
1,AVOID IT,TAKE MY ADVICE AND DO NOT SEE THIS FILTH. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. YOU WILL NEVER GET THOSE 100 MINUTES BACK. GO OUT WITH A DEAR FRIEND OR GROUP TO STARBUCKS AND HAVE A COFFEE OR MOCHA AND ENJOY SOME QUALITY TIME.
1,Waste of Time,The movie was so bad that I couldn't remember what it was about until I read the reviews. My husband still doesn't remember the movie. It's a good thing that I'm retired and have lots of time.Betty
1,would like to give it 0 stars,"What a piece of garbage movie. My two teenage daughters found it hysterical, but it's not for anyone over the age of 35. Hard to believe they spend millions making movies like this."
1,Must be stoned to like it.,Complete waste of time in my opinion. The movie was just a bunch of stoners saying and doing nothing interesting throughout the entire movie. Any hilarity that can be imagined between the old ladies never comes to fruition as the writing is completely horrible. . . There is no plot until the last 15 minutes of the movie.
5,funny movie,this movie is hilarious. probably one of the top five funniest movies i own. the acting was good and there were alot of funny one liners. jonah hill was funny even though his parts were short. nick swarsdan also is very funny. any fan of these guys or anybody in adam sandler films this movie is clearly worth buying. i hope the new film strange wilderness is also funny
5,Funniest Movie I've Seen in a Long TIme,"My sister happened to catch this on cable one night just for something to watch. No one had ever heard of it but by the next day she was telling everyone this was the funniest movie she's seen in a long time. She had said that if I happen to catch this on cable I should take the time and wouldn't be dissappointed. The humor is silly in nature but it's done really well. It reminds me more of classic comedy from the 80s rather than some of the stuff they come up with today. I laughed out loud watching this movie. After my initial viewing of this movie it seemed that I'd always have to watch it if I came across it on cable just ""flipping through"". I decided I'd miss it once it was out of it's rotation on cable and purchased it to add to my DVD collection. I've told numerous people about this movie all who have seen it (or borrowed my DVD) have to agree it was pretty funny."
4,Totally agreeing...from SP777,"I'm just taking time to say that khryoleoz basically wrote what I feel so far about the Kaleido Star series thus far.It's one of those series that's become a 'guilty pleasure' of mine, especially after a hard day at work. You won't enjoy it UNLESS you're a big kid at heart and open-minded to those fun & thoughtful animes that come out of nowhere and grab you unexpectedly, which is what Kaleido Star did for me.Of course I miss Layla, but thankfully she has her own story which I can't WAIT to be released on DVD called 'Kaleido Star: Rise of the Phoenix'. There's a longer title, but we'll see how ADV decides on how to do the title."
5,Could be Offensive. I don't mind.,"I am a fan of Seth MacFarlane's shows.American Dad is funny and has good jokes that go along with the plot.Roger is a hilarious character, I really enjoy his seemingly limitless personalities."
5,Hillarious,Funniest American Dad ever. I laughed so hard I started crying. Normally I laugh a little or chuckle at certain jokes during a single episode but this one in particular was a riot. Only episode of AD I've ever bought. Just had to rewatch it. Steve's part in the episode is insanely funny.
1,Don't waste your time,This is such a short clip that it is really a waste of your time downloading it. You can go to the television and watch an episode of Great American Dad.
1,A seriously disturbed episode that is not entertaining,"As much as I like weird things and stuff that violates the norm and makes people think, this episode was messed up and disturbing. I suppose the point of the episode is that people should not be selfish about the lives of others, that letting others who are near death live through extreme means might be unfair to them. But what a seriously messed up way of delivering that message. This show is supposed to be entertaining -- even when it delivers a moral -- but this episode was just sad and unsettling."
5,Hilarious. Great streaming quality.,"I had first seen this episode on Hulu, and instantly became addicted. I think it's by far one of the best American Dad episodes - ever. Can Cee Lo please help produce music for every show? Quality of the episode through Amazon is great; if you want full screen in high quality you just open the video in it's own window (option on bottom right hand corner of screen when you're playing the video). I was able to stream it on my 60"" sharp HDTV with no problems."
5,Best of Cosby,I believe that season two is by far the pinnacle of Cosby's career. What started out as a review of his comedic writings in season 1 has matured and come to the fullness of the real life family of actors that made up the Huxtable family. Few shows have delighted my heart the way this show has and season two is top notch viewing. I'd buy it again and again!
5,What's taking so long?,"This is a superb family show, full of wit, common sense and intelligence. WHY IS TAKING SO LONG FOR FURTHER SEASONS? Obviously these film companies don't wish to make money or they would get shows out like this one faster, rather than some of the poor quality shows that seem to pump out at an alarminly fast rate. Get it out! Get it sold before the majority forget what it is!We're ready to spend money!"
5,Geniune,I simply love what this show represents. It is a wonderful show 20 years later. Everyone enjoys the Cosbys and the way they raised their children.
5,Quality show,The Cosby show is a must for any family. It's timeless humor keeps everyone laughing of all generations. Today's sitcoms really rely on immoral humor that just lacks the raw values of everyday life. With the Cosby show there is a certain trust that you will always get a guiltless laugh...:)
5,Good fun!,My husband I have been looking for some decent tv shows to watch with our 8 yr old son. We stumbled on the Cosby show one night on TV Land and my son laughed through the whole show. We bought the dvd to watch it together when there is nothing on TV to watch (which is frequently) and we laugh at ech episode. I forgot how good this show was and how much I enjoyed it when it was on TV. It's a great dvd for the whole family!
2,No Episode Guide!,I was very disappointed when I opened this video. There was no episode guide included as there normally would be. There is no way to know what is on each disc without putting it in the dvd player. There is not a list on the cover or included inside. It looks to be original packaging so I'm not sure what happened to the guide.
3,Unknows actors with memorable tunes,"A bunch of unknown actors except Autumn Reeser who had a supporting role in The O.C.Despite that, the songs didn't disappoint. My favorites are ""Clear,"" ""Dreaming Wide Awake"" & ""Survivor."""
2,"Win some, lose some",The DVD looks in good shape but when we watched it the DVD skipped and froze. It's not our DVD player as we played other DVD's just fine. Daughter disappointed--my own fault for not figuring out how to return/exchange.
4,If not for any other reason: Yassmin Alers,"The television release of this musical was over-shadowed by multiple programs released on the same night and MTV did not place enough strength behind the release date. The result is that this one did not get the attention it deserved was hit with poor viewer ratings.The film is loaded with fun musical moments. The production team included the people involved with the ""High School Musical"" flicks so it was bound to have some shining moments.But it was a flop on the tube.Which brings me to;Why buy the DVD? If not for any other reason: Yassmin Alers.The kids put on a great show but then suddenly we realize what PRO means when Alers hits the stage for the finale.If they create a sequel (the set-up for one is there), they need to give this gal more screen time and more musical moments."
5,A live action anime so bad... it's good,"My Thoughts:This movie is a fun romp through a Cat Girl Horror Movie Spoof. The first 30 minutes are a bit boring, but the latter part of the movie is great. Especially when the, foul mouthed and funny, Evil Rabbit Cat makes his appearance beside the Zombie Cat Girl. The overall arc of the movie is similiar to that of 'The Evil Dead' only with Cat Girls. The writer threw in just about every spoof he could do on a budget, and then some, including not only anime and horror movie references and jokes, but also Video Game, Sci Fi, and a few Cinema Classics. There is a good 5.1 Surround sound mix for the movie, and an OK Directors Commentary, with Bloopers and Promo stuff for bonus material, the disc is better than what you would expect from a Low-Budget movie. Overall, if your an Anime or Horror Movie Geek, and you like Low Budget movies with a bit of style, you will enjoy Night of the Living Cat Girl."
1,This product burns through batteries,"When it works, it works great.However, it burns through batteries every 3-4 weeks. I have paid more for batteries than I originally paid for the scale. Either my unit is defective, or the product as a whole is defective.I've contacted the company for a replacement or refund."
4,Animals of North America,I bought this book for a young reader and love the full page pictures. i know he will love it.
5,Superb!,"This Rhino reissue of Dionne's last Scepter release is full of wonderful additions, as if the original wasnt reason enough to buy this. You get around a dozen live cuts from a Dionne concert around the time the album was made; several duets with B.J. Thomas never released; as well as other gems never before heard. Dionne's last Scepter single, Who Gets the Guy? is also included. The original is full of wonderful cuts: Check Out Time, and unusual Bacharach-David gem; covers of Goin Out of My Head, Yesterday and many others. Great liner notes as well. A must have for any Dionne fan!"
5,Classic Dionne and super sound!,Beautiful remaster with lots of bonuses. Ultra clean sound is amazing and this does justice to the legacy of Ms. Warwick.
3,Beau Pere,"After the sudden death of his wife, Remy (Patrick Dewaere), is forced to take care of his 14-year-old stepdaughter (Ariel Besse) who, unbeknownst to him, has fallen in love with him. Ariel does a very nice acting job and is very pretty, but the nude scenes are lacking in both quantity and content. There is no frontal nudity of her and you get only a glimpse of her backside when walking to her room and also when sitting on the bed. I know that you not need nudity or sexual situations to tell a story but after seeing Ariel the movie leaves you wanting more."
3,A little slow,"Nicely shot, beautiful images, story is a little lacking, and it moves like a snail in winter. Good for a long cold winter night."
1,As erotic as apple pie....,"I can think of more ways to enjoy an apple pie than this...French flick! Not one erotic moment and who isn't buying this to see a ""Lolita"" type relationship in action? That's just it...there is no action! If seeing two bare breasts of a young French actress is what you call erotic or exciting...this film could be stimulating to you...however, if you want stimulating, buy ""The Lover"", or ""The Image"". Now those are serious erotic films...this is just a loser, plain and simple. You are better off with a Barely Legal magazine and some hand lotion."
1,"BRILLIANT FILM, Another Horrible Fox Lorber release!","This wonderfully controversial Bertrand Blair film deserves SO much better than this disgusting, muddy looking, non 16:9, poorly remastered DVD release. HALF WAY THROUGH THE FILM, THE SUBTITLES ACTUALLY GO OUT OF SYNCH!Hopefully a company more deserving will release this, say Criterion..."
1,"Great film, but badly-made DVD.","This is an excellent film by a great director--which I would normally give five stars. Unfortunately, the company who produced the DVD was neither excellent nor great, and screwed-up the DVD--which forced me into giving it only a one star rating. About halfway into the film, the sub-titles go totally out of sync for quite some period of time, and don't represent what is being said by the person being shown on screen! Hopefully, a newly sub-titled DVD by a better company will eventually be made."
1,Don't waste your time,"Obviously, the ideas presented by the author of this book are totally wrong. Since the publication of this book, the field of science has made many advances which show that not only is science not at its end, but the potential of science is increasing over time. (For example, consider nanotechnology and reprogenetics.)The author of this book makes a mistake that is actually common among scientist: assuming that technology will always be the same as it is today. The credibility of this book ranks among that of those who have said, ""man will never be able to walk on the moon,"" or ""scientist will never be able to clone the DNA of a somatic cell."" The author reminds me of a top-ranking administrator at the patent office who, in 1901, recommended closing the patent office because he couldn't imagine that any further important inventions would be made.Don't waste your time. Go watch a Disney movie instead. =)"
3,"Mildly amusing, but often ignorant about-science friction","Horgan did a superb job putting together a list of great scientists and describing their chins, houses, fingernails, cars, and clothing. He succeeded in picking the quotes that represent scientist's view (and support Horgan's).This book is distant from science, though. Horgan *writes* at length about everything from the big bang theory to quantum mechanics, but fails to *understand* and correctly present even trivial concepts such as diffusion (p.87) and equilibrium (p. 216); furthermore, the analysis given is often personal rather than logical.This book is also far from good fiction - it is just not very entertaining and has too few fresh ideas (compared, say, to Isaak Asimov's fiction or to the ""Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy"").Because the book is neither science nor fiction, and because it is so focused on mocking and (sometimes ignorant) criticism, I propose to classify it as ""about-science friction""."
5,One of the most enjoyable books in recent years,"The End of Science is delightful to read. Horgan has done a masterful job with his subject. It is fun to see what many leading scientists are like and what they are thinking about science. It is clear from the book that the scientists themselves do not agree about the future of science. Horgan's thesis that science is in its twilight years is unprovable, but it is persuasive and provides coherence to the book. The arcane details of science can be hard to follow, but the issues of the future and role of science are meaningful to anyone."
2,Church of the Holy Horror?,"This book underscores, with unconscious precision, the fallacies of intellectual life in the late twentieth century. In a series of revealing profiles of top scientists, Horgan unwittingly exposes the link between a common scientific worldview and Horgan's own jaded attitude. Horgan does not seem to grasp how much he has in common with his interview subjects! His cosmic reverie at the end of the book, flat on his back on a suburban lawn, mirrors the scientific impasse. In the vision, Horgan recapitulates the entire history of the scientific revolution (growing insight, seemingly unlimited power, hubris, cosmic aloneness, etc.). As put by Conway Morris, the idea that human destiny is entirely mundane may be the most peculiar error of the moderns. The End of Science is symptomatic of that error."
2,Very uneven writing.,I agree with the review by rickert@acad.udallas.edu. Horgan's editorial license in describing the words and mannerisms of his interview subjects are at times downright infuriating. His dime-store explanations of complex principles is at times laughable. He merits my rating of 4 points only because he included so many of the intellectual giants of the late 20th century in his interviews.
4,Nothing continues exponentially -- even science will slow,"The book is a good read, its arguments well supported. It is certainly an unpopular notion that science has limits, and that is already beginning to slow. But the arguments are clear. A question that remains, will the exponential growth in technology slow in our lifetimes and give human nature and ethics a chance to catch up?"
3,Well written...but!,"This book was interesting, well argued and passionate. However, it was ultimately handicaped by what seemed to me to be a ludicrous premise!I'm not a professional scientist but I just find it hard to imagine how anyone could possibly think that all the big questions are close to being answered. As an amateur historian, however, I have seen this idea expressed many time before... and I don't see why this latest assertion won't end up on the same pile as the others."
1,A narrow state of mind,"What a waste. Talking to all these highly intelligent people and framing them in such a narrow-minded structure. A more suitable subtitle would have been: ""How John Horgan Borrowed Big Names to Spread his Limited Positivist View on the World"". The book really tells more about the writer than about the people who have been interviewed. The conversations are flimsy, lack any depth and turn knowledgeable people into flat characters. Putting aside the issue of insights and content (Horgan just doesn't know his stuff, esp. not on philosophy) the book is not nice to read. The plot is predictable and rigid. Horgan's gospel is boring to read."
3,How many times will this be written?,"I feel like I have read many books that address this same thesis in part or in whole. Kant said that Newtonian mechanics completely described the physical world, and he was neither the first nor the last (obviously) to discuss the end of science. Every generation of scientists seems to believe that we have figured it all out, and every generation to date has been proved wrong.Is there an end to knowledge? Perhaps. But we are far from it, for even what we have now are only models and linear (mostly), abstract representations of what reality may be.Read this book for the interviews, but there is still much to be done."
3,Where is My Review,"I wrote a review for this book, which has now been removed - why is this - is it a problem if there are too many negative reviews on a book"
2,shallow presentation of science and limits of knowledge,"I did not like this book much because it presented a shallow view on scientific knowledge. He presents numerous viewpoints of others to support his viewpoints, but all this shows is that some people agree. His arguments are easily refuted. For example the whole thrust of his book is that knowledge is limited. But this isn't true. Philosophers have long known that something cannot come from nothing. Reality is eternal. It has no beginning nor end. It is infinite. Knowledge which is our interpretation of reality is also infinite. There cannot be an end to knowledge. The universe, one scientist said, is not only strange, it is stranger than we can imagine. No doubt. Horgan does not consider this, or other skeptical arguments. We are left with a biased viewpoint, that leads nowhere. Scientists, are not at the end of knowledge, but barely scraping the surface of infinite knowledge. Science may run out of money, but it can never run out of knowledge."
4,hugely entertaining,"Horgan's vivid and often mocking portraits of a number of prominent scientists and philosophers make for hilarious and unforgettable reading. The book derives its value however, from Horgan's abilities to humanize his subjects and to explain many major scientific and philosophical issues in a clear and stimulating way. My major criticism is that he supports his end-of-science thesis by interviewing primarily senior scientists who are probably past their prime. If Horgan wants to find out about new directions in science, he should have found some eager young mavericks who are intent on breaking through current paradigms."
1,Journalists are not scientists!!!,"""The End of Science"" is a stupid book written by a stupid science fanboy journalist with a big case of envy for Francis Fukuyama's ""The End of History and the Last Man."" ""The End of Science"" is what happens when journalists spend so much time hanging out and fawning over scentists that they start believing they're scientists themselves."
4,Author says the emperor has few clothes...,"Classic 'emperor has no clothes' material. The most noteworthy sound bite in the book, to me, is Horgan's term Ironic Science. This seems particularly applicable in the field of physics and cosmology (with Stephen Hawking the head wizard) where string theory and multiverse theory have become the recent rages. It's like the most talented modern scientists at some juncture realized that they could either devote their careers to ""the mere filling in of details"" of some existing groundbreaking work such as relativity, or they could propose a truly new and probably unprovable theory that would garner some acclaim for them in a wider sphere. Naturally some of these ambitious fellows chose the latter course. But the 'man on the street' rather than just shrug and accept this and pay taxes for the next particle accelerator has a right to ask -- whither science?"
4,true state of our ignorance,it relates our current state of knowledge in the sciences - accurate and timely - limited only by some name dropping and a bit of rambling in the stories... a little more editing never hurt any of us aspiring writers.
4,Elegant and simple; works well,"These shin guards are great. They have this super-stretchy sheath to hold them in place so I don't have to play with straps, etc. The guards themselves are simple and functional, and do the job. Only down side is that when I bought them, there was no size chart. I had guessed the size, and when they came, it was clear from the size chart on the package, as well as after trying them on, that I was one size too small, and I had to ship back, and re-order. I'm 5'6"", and a small/med T-shirt size, and wear sm or medium pants, and the appropriate size for me was a Large."
4,Good quality shin guard,This is a good quality shin guard that can give you good protection on your shin against hard tackle very lite and well made cheap it worth the price its better than many other shin guard out there so i will recommend this shin guard to anyone out there who want and good quality shin guard that will give you great amount of protection...
2,Useful,This product was ok...it's being used. Not the best. but I needed something instead putting more holes in the wall.
4,The Fiberglass Boat repair Manual,"This book is a very good guide for the novice in looking into doing some fiberglass repair . I think it covers alot of the fundamentals which is necessary, however it did not fully address the area that I was most interested in such as the stringer repair and replacement in my boat. As I said I think it is well worth the addition to my library and would recomend it to anyone who is anticipating any fiberglass repair."
5,This book goes A-Z on the subject of fiberglass boat repair.,The how to get through the process of repairing a fiberglass boat is normally to find someone else who has done it that will take the time to tell you what to do. The hope is that you find someone willing to listen to what you have going on with your situation and knows how to explain each step. Unless you know what you should do next there are so many chances you will get stuck. This book proves absolutely thorough on the subject. You can go into a group discussion on the topic after reading this book feeling confident that you know what's what about the use of these composite materials as applied to marine small craft.
5,Fiberglass Boat Repair Manual: This is the authoritative guide.,"If you have either a new boat or a classic one -- odds are you'll drop a tool and damage the gelcoat or something worse.This book will take the panic out of the event, as the author gives an explanation you'd expect to get from your uncle.. You get matter-of-fact instruction about repairs ranging from simple damage to profound problems such as core rot.I very recommend this book."
3,Fiberglass repair,"Good book. Tells about all the various gel coats and fiberglass meshes, some of which i don't need to know but. Gives ample instruction on what to use and touches on how to use fiberglass. This is a technical book on the materials needed,not the greatest in how to use. It was a good buy although. I give it 3 1/2 stars in the information catalog."
3,dated,"This is a very old book as far as fiberglass boats go.Must later prcedures,and products not included. There is some usefull info in the book"
3,"Good overview, but...","The main complaint I have with this book is that some of the photography veers towards the abstract or obscure. Frankly in an architecture book I'm not interested in the photographer's or author's artistic pretensions. Let the architect's work speak for itself - something that many authors on architecture seem reluctant to do these days. Having experienced some of the work featured in this book, there were some photographs that left me wondering if I'd been in the same building as these guys. It was great to see floorplans but some drawings or draft plans illustrating Pawson's design process would have been very welcome."
5,Oster Size #3 Blade,"Received this item a lot quicker than expected. Was very happy about that. Have had this blade before and it is excellent if you don't want a real close cut. Leave hair about 1/2"" to 5/8"" long. Had the same blade at least 10 years before I broke a couple teeth on it. Used blade about every 6 to 8 weeks. Would recommend."
3,not what I expected,"I didn't do enough research before purchasing this blade. My thought that ""skip tooth"" was going to mean a wider cutting gap so it would more easily cut through thicker matted hair. That is not actually the case. The skip just means that every other tooth is simply shorter. With that said, I feel this blade made it more difficult for me to cut my pups hair.I actually had better success with the standard #10 that came with my clippers. And if all you really want is a 1/2"" length, it would be cheaper for you to use your existing blade and eye ball it, or just buy a set of inexpensive comb attachments."
3,"About ""women"" more than mothers and daughters","I have seen this twice. It is an enjoyable story about women, who happen to have children. I wouldn't say it is specifically about mothers and daughters....as there are themes of addiction, cheating, and adolescence going on too.A good chick flick for sure."
3,Okay,"I purchased this bag online because of Slumberjack's reputation for backpacker-friendly bags (and also the price). I get very cold at night and need a low temp bag even on pretty warm nights. I bought this for backpacking but this bag is so incredibly bulky that it will not fit into my backpack. I can't even tie it onto the outside. It seems warm, though. If you're planning on backpacking with this backpack, I would recommend something that stuffs MUCH smaller. I also own a Slumberjack Super Guide 30F bag and while I would never dream of sleeping in 30F degree weather with it (maybe 50F), it packs to an extremely small size. Anyway, while this is probably a nice bag for car camping, it is useless as a backpacking bag. It is just as bulky and heavy as any other regualr bag that you could pick up at Wal-mart."
5,sleeping bag,"Love the fact you can buy two (one right, one left zipper) and zipper them together; although it is hard to move around when zippered together, but definitely warmer. I get extremely cold so I still had to wear tons of layers while in the bag when temps were only about 30's. The bag also slips around on a tent floor b/c of the two materials (tent and bag) being similar; so putting something down between is a good idea... otherwise the bag may total flip over after changing positions a couple times in the night."
2,misleading,"it wasn't very clear that this is a ""short"" length sleeping bag. My 11 year old son barely fits in it. I am disappointed by this and am not sure how much more I will continue shopping online."
4,Peaceful Pleasure,"Body and Soul By Al Cohn and Zoot Sims is lush and peaceful: it's a really beautiful song. If you like soft, peaceful jazz, you'll like this album. Also, definitely try Jazz For A Rainy Afternoon."
4,It's a must for your collection,"Great music just to listen to. Whether you're cooking, puttering around the house or commuting to work. I'm always looking for a sound that is relaxing and doesn't interfere (if I don't want it to) and this is one of them. Great for dinner as well, although I'm not sure that you could classify it as dinner music. I had never actually heard the whole CD, so I was pleasantly surprised with all of it. I highly recommend it."
3,Cue Maintenance Confusion,"Bought this kit to try and repair some old pool cues left to me along with a pool table. The kit looks great but unless you already know something about repairing pool sticks, the kit won't help. It includes no instructions of any type and doesn't identify what everything is in the kit. I'm still looking for instructions on the Internet..."
1,This product is NOT for African-American hair.,"I purchased this expensive product with the belief that it would keep African-American hair streighter during and after blow-drying. Wrong.The product caused my hair to become brittle, and breaking. I will not use it again, and I am not sure how to send it back. In this economy, I lost more money that I needed to."
4,just review,A novel which carries the readers to the most worm corners of hidden history in mesopotamia tring to resurrect it`s greatness and purity to find solutions to the critical present day problems in our world.
3,Fun but not too practical,"Handmade houseboats is a fun book, but if you really want to live on a boat and you don't have an extremely shletered bit of water that is shallow enough so that your boat can't sink, I would suggest looking elsewhere for actual plans. This guy talks about living on boats in all sorts of waters, but he seems to be thinking about living in a swamp.On the other hand, he does have some pretty solid advice about the history of houseboats, and the domestic needs of houseboat dwellers. I particularly liked his advice on electrical systems.This is a great armchair book."
2,Historic Information,"The author seems to be a true original and obviously has a wealth of experience with houseboats.Trouble is, most of the content of the book is over 40 years old. Since the book was originally copyrighted in 1953 materials and techniques have advanced by light years.This book might be helpful if you're building your own boat on a really tight budget and and you think you can benefit from early 50's technology, or, you like reading about older boatbuilding techniques."
5,no loose ends,"Caroline Graham's mysteries featuring Inspector Barnaby begin rather like a plate of spagetti. Stuff happening everywhere-bits of information seemingly unrelated to anything, but by the end all strands have been beautifully woven into a tight, neat package - with no loose bits sticking out anywhere. Her characters are both unique and entertaining and Inspector Barnaby is a real charmer."
2,Death In Disguise,"Although written by an author who obviously has a keen sense of humor, the plot very rapidly disintegrates into a sharp-tongued social critique; the diaglogue becomes increasingly difficult to follow and the sense of delightful sarcasm falls flat. Doubt if I ever will purchase another book written by Caroline Graham."
1,Waste of Money,"The book was written 1997, do not get confused with the publishing date of 2003. The printed daily line charts are from 1997 without hardly any description. The same almost applies to the numerous useless pages filled with tables of historical spread trades that (maybe) could have been done between 1981 and 1996. This book neither contains stategies nor addresses risk at all. Furthermore the book is full of sentences of the following kind: ""Computer generated Numbers. Most traders have a library of proven computer numbers. They may be applied with success in spread trading. The only caveat however, is that they usually are not self-contained systems and should be used along with the several other devices I have spoken about.""My advice: Walk away from this trade!"
2,Title is misleading....,"The title is very misleading due to the fact that this book contains no trading strategies. It does, however, do a good job of talking about the psychology of trading (one of the most important aspects). The interviews are good but contain no real practical knowledge. In my opinion, save the money and go for another, perhaps more advanced book if you're concerned with trading strategies. I will not even recommend this book to the beginner for it requires a broad knowledge of how the trading floor works. This book mentions little about value (the MOST important thing about legging and trading spreads). As far as spread trading goes, this isn't the one. Dan Vassallo (New York Cotton Exchange)."
1,"Not much there, really","Why are the first 3 chapters of this book dedicated to trading physcology? Also, there are chapters of charts, which really seem like page filler. This book was pretty useless to me."
1,Waste of Money,"I am not sure who gave this book a 5 star rating, but after reading the book it must have been the authors family. It is a waste of time and money and dont recommend it for even a novice."
2,Book is mistitled....,"Some valuable if readily available advice on psychology of trading, but the inerviews are basc and reveal nothing new, and the pages and pages of reprints from Moore Reasearch years-old spread data is a joke - while there are a couple of small nuggets here, there is nothing at all of any value for a trader who already knows what a spread trade is."
1,zzzzzzzzz,"zzzzzzz..i fell asleep listening to this, its boring. the voice is boring and theres nothing is really oustanding here."
5,An example of calorie restriction,"This is the earliest written book on the benefits of calorie restiction I have found. The author's observations and benefits of his personal lifestyle correlate with recent scientific fidnings which include enhanced resistance to disease, increased stress resistance, increased lifespan, and increased function into old age. However, the reader should be advised by a physician and I recommend reading a study in Spain by Valejo (PubMed) as well as literature by Masaro (serarch Amazon or PubMed) and DK Ingram (PubMed) on the effects of dietary/calorie restriction. - Bruce Jones, Scientific Researcher and Medical Student (2005)"
1,Low amp. output !,"This home charger did not work with my env9900. The amp output is too low. It should be at least .9 amp, this one reads .5 amp.But you get what you pay for. Its all right for the lighter phones. The seller should subtract certain models that don't work."
1,WRONG item,"They sent me the wrong charger for my LG chocolate phone. Very disappointed since I depended on the history of good reviews. It'd cost me even more money to ship it back for an exchange or refund, so I opted against it so basically it's a loss. I wonder if that's how they make their money sometimes."
3,question,does this work for the first choclate in black please help me. I really need a charger please awnser asap asap pleaseeeee
1,"An awful, misguided, and harmful book","This book is out dated and out of print. Good thing too considering that it follows the early eighties themes of everyone is codependent, and past life regression can help you remember things such as being assaulted by Russian soldiers in the last century and once you remember that, you will suddenly stop repressing feeling of your own abuse. Yeah right. If you find this book, destroy it!"
5,Remember,"AWESOME! You really get to know the characters and root for them, cry with them, and pray with them. It doesn't hurt that I live near Bloomington."
5,Amazing writer!,"Karen Kingsbury has done it once again! This book keeps you involved page after page. I am not normally a pleasure reader, but I cannot put her books down once I get started. I am laughing out loud or have tears running down my cheeks when reading her books. Karen has a way of taking a story down a road you just don't quite expect. She illustrates real life and not what we 'want' to. She makes me really think about my own life and how I affect those around me. I think reading her books has made me a better wife, mother, and friend."
5,A must to read !!!,This family goes through so much but they are always thankful for all things. You find yourself praying for them and you really see how strong their faith really is !! ANOTHER GREAT BOOK !!!
5,Super!,"Karen adds such realism to the story! You become part of the Baxter clan. Since, I actual read the other series first, I look for when different parts of the story line are added."
5,Amazing!!!!,I am the worlds slowest reader....I read the first 2 books in 2 1/2 weeks!!! I can't say enough great things sbout this author and these books!! The moral fiber running through this family is amazing and I think everyone should read them!!Be Blessed!!!
4,Great book,"I loved this book, I first picked up redemption at a local christian store unaware of Karen Kingsbury and while I enjoyed it the second book is still my favourite in the Redemption series. This particular book establishes a number stories that do continue as Ashley is a central character to the Baxter series. I must admit that the 9/11 theme does get annoying as she rehashes constantly. There is no doubt that the world changed that day but do we need to have it discussed in just about every chapter. I loved how Ashley came alive during Remember and relationships were re-established and her discovery of her she was through her position at the aged care facility. I recommend this book as the best of Karen's books that I've read."
5,good read,part of the redemption series and if you have not read it you have missed out. a series of five books and karen kingsbury is an amazing author...
1,Niles Amp,This replacement for a Niles TVA-30 has half the power and twice the heat. The sound amplification barely does the job in comparison to the TVA-30 I'm very disappointed with it.
1,unsatisfied,The battery died the same day and it says that it has multiple power levels but it only has one.
3,same problem as above,"the audio for house on haunted hill on my dvd is messed up, too. the movies are great, but the audio problem is very distracting."
3,"good, but sound is bad on one movie... here's what I did","I made a copy of that movie only (using CloneDVD) and watched one version on one player, while listening to the sound of the copy on another player (with headphones). The delay is 5 seconds. I didn't copy it to resell it, as the copy has bad sound, too, (in case some people wonder about it, though everybody does it...) but just to match the sound of one with the picture of the other. It can be done on video, too, if you prefer (or can't copy the DVD or don't have 2 DVD players)I know that many of you cannot do that, but if you have a way to copy that movie and 2 dvd players, try it. It took me a while to match the sound and the picture, but when I did, it was perfect! : )"
4,Nanotech=Immortality,"McDonald takes this idea and runs with it. Very dense with ideas. Humans have gained the ability to resurrect the dead, but can't still can't abide the big D. The Dead are alienated by family and friends and are cast into a de jure system of indentured servitude. For other SF books heavy on nanotech read The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson, The Bohr Maker and Deception Well by Linda Nagata, and Aristoi by Walter Jon Williams. For easily accessible non-fiction read Great Mambo Chicken & the Transhuman Condition and Nano, both by Ed Regis"
2,It's Okay,"The book was all right, a good bathroom read to pass time, but it could have been better. There was a lot going on, but not enough explanation, the story had potential to be much more."
1,Really hard to get into,I have to say this is not a great book. The Sci-fCincinnatii book club read this book this month and most of us were unable to complete it. It didn't have any defenders in the group. He doesn't provide a clear description of the world. There are many different plots and characters that make it very hard to tell what is going on. A lot of the text just doesn't make any sense. The writing has a very poetic style. Lots of alliteration even some haikus. The downside of that is that it makes it very hard to read.
2,Couldn't finish it,"This book could not catch my interest, which I consider surprising as the subject should be compelling. I will try again in the future."
1,Did I read the same book?,Of all of Ian McDonald's novels -- which I love -- this is the only one I simply couldn't bear. Molasses from beginning to wherever it was I gave up.
2,"This IS supposed to be a horror movie, right...?","Wow, maybe this is a different Grudge 3 than everyone else here thought so highly of.This has got to be one of the most BORING movies I've ever seen. And sadly, this fact is even more punctuated by the fact that its supposed to be a horror movie.At one point in the movie, I was pretty sure I'd been watching for at least an hour. Unfortunately only about 27 minutes had passed.Yes, this is a painfully boring story. Far more ""dialog"" than anything else.Don't get me wrong, I really liked the first Grudge. I was so-so about the second one. But this one is just tiresome. I can only hope they don't decide to make a Grudge 4.Save your time for something more interesting. Like... watching paint dry."
2,Only worth a rental.,"Sad how Matthew Knight got top billing and is hardly in it at all. This film was a big letdown! Took too long to get started and when it did, totally predictable. Characters other than Gil McKinney (really hot guy) and Emi Ikehata (the best actor in the film) were a bore. I wish they would not continue with this franchise, but will.Do yourself a favor, just watch the Japanese versions of them. America is not good at all with remakes or continuation of films."
3,It's OK,"Not as scary as the first two, it's mediocre. It tries, at least, unlike some horror movie sequels (like hell raiser 3 and on, or some of the Return of the Living Dead sequels). I just think its not that original anymore. The first Grudge was so unique looking the creatures and their movements were jarring and surreal. The white pasty face and twitching just doesn't do it for me anymore."
2,Disappointing Sequel,"I felt this movie overused the ""ghost/spirit"" shots and showed the ""ghost/spirit"" too much. A movie like this should be able to show very little of the actual ghost/spirit for better effect. Definitely a movie made to cash in on the popularity of the original."
2,You will not see any awards,"Original story, very poor acting, would have been better with more compelling performances. Probably the 3rd sequel, I guess, should have spent a little more money on the actors."
4,Suspense!,"This movie delivered suspense and horror, I actually prefer the third Grudge of the other two, it was more realistic in it's plot and made me want to continue watching the movie. I enjoyed the characters and felt their fright of the unknown. This was a great horror film. However it does stir away from the other two plots of movie and can be confusing as to how and why. The setting is more current and not in China and locates more in a apartment complex of the boy who witnessed the murder of his family and who is having some problems sleeping. A great horror flick."
1,Unbelievable and Worse,"I knew going in that when you watch the third installment of a popular franchse that it's already been squeezed and dried up of any creative juices.This one proved my fears. Somehow I just can't get freaked out by watching a Japanese boy and woman painted with white body make-up and lots of mascara around their eyes. In this terribly low-budget slice of cheese, these two figures are the only demonic monsters. I hit the reject button after the main male figure becomes possessed by an evil spirit and proceeds to stab a woman who doesn'try to escape--she just cowers and watches him come toward her with the knife. And watching this happen is the heroine and child who also just stand and cower and weep. No one ever tries to escape the evil spirits. They merely bulge their eyes and freeze. This cheapie is so low-rent I can't see it even playing on the SyFy Channel-notorious for showing the cheesiest made for TV schlock fests on planet earth."
4,The title says it all!,"Fast-paced and great for kids. Short clips which follow one another, and should keep the attention of any train-lovin' kid. I know my grandson was spellbound the entire time. Just a ton of video shots of model trains and a driving soundtrack...what more could you ask for?"
1,A misleading title providing false hope,"I suffer from Macular Degeneration and bought the book, hoping to find, as the title suggests, a way to reverse the disease. There was no proven cure in the book. Plus, the book has only one chapter on MD, not the whole book as might be construed from the title. Millions of Americans suffer from MD for which there is no definite cure. The title is a good sales booster. People like me who have been told by numerous physicians that there is no cure, will buy the book. If you are a patient of MD, eat a lot of bilberry, antioxidants and lutein( found in leafy greens like spinach) and most of all, pray. God made us and He only can cure; we can only try, it is He that can make it happen."
3,Out of Date,This book is out of date medically. Since it was published in 1998 there have been many advances in the treatment of Age Related Macular Degeneration. While nutritional support remains the only current treatment for the dry form of the disorder there are several approaches to treatment for the wet form which results in much quicker loss of vision. I have received eye injections of a chemotherapy drug every 6 weeks for 18 months for the wet form with excellent results. The drug stops the growth of new blood vessels under the retina which is what causes much of the damage. Current medical treatment options give significantly more reason to be hopeful that the wet form of the disorder can be successfully managed. New approaches are in the research and development phases. The nutritional information presented by Dr.Rose is relevant to everyone wishing to be as healthy as possible.
3,Not Real Impressed,"I was doing research on Macular Degeneration as my father has just been diagnosed with it. This is one of 6 books that I purchased on it. Had I been in a bookstore looking through it I probably would not have included it in my purchase. However, if you are in to Natural healing, I guess it would be a worthwhile purchase."
5,Best shoulder rest.,"I have done research about viola and violin shoulder rest. And this comes the best one that we have. Just bought recently the viola shoulder rest and immediately my daughter feels natural and much better with long playing time. This shoulder rest can be adjusted to completely fit to the contour of the individual shoulder with strong grasp on the upper part of the shoulder, which helps alot to maintain natural posture during play. Strongly recommended, even though a little higher price compared to other branch."
5,My all time favorite Pirate romance!,"I never thought any book would usurp ""Gentle Rogue"" by Johanna Lindsey as my all time favorite pirate romance, but ""His Wicked Kiss"" has done it. Foley has a talent for writing heros and Black Jack Knight can make any woman's heart swoon. I also love this heroine. She counters him as a perfect mate in a very primal way. She is fearless, strong and loyal, and you can forgive her for her being a bit star struck by the aristicrats of England, although it takes Jack a bit to find his way of doing so. One of my favorite scenes is when she is caught as a stowaway on his ship, cornered by Jack, he demands her weapon, so she hurls her machete to strike the wood right near his head. His sardonic reply is, ""Why Miss Faraday, you stabbed my ship!"" I love it!! It is part adventure, but the romance is the real star here. Make room for it on your keeper shelf! You will read it over and over."
3,"Great beginning, but fell flat in the end....","Gaelen Foley is an amazing writer, and this book started off wonderfully! But towards the middle it just became repetitive, and slow... You have to read it just because it's Gaelen Foley and part of the Knight Family Series, but plan on it taking you a while!"
3,3 1/2 stars...It was OK,"For me I couldn't get into the first half of the book. I guess I had way too high expectations for the last of the Knight siblings. I guess I wanted Jack's story to be a little more dangerous. The heroin was so child like and naive in the beginning and then in the last half Jack was exhibiting childish behavior. A little annoying. The story was just OK for me. I wanted something MORE! Just like with Alec's story, something MORE please! But I'm still keeping hope for the Knight cousins' books! *crossing fingers*"
2,Had potential...,"I agree with a lot of the other reviews that this book started off great but it just fizzled. The ""misunderstandings"" between Jack and Eden after they go to london seemed so trivial that it didn't make sense for them to fight about it. Eden's lack of understanding about Jack's problems and the way she shut him out was very annoying. Her character developed from a sweet, quirky girl that lived in the jungle to a superficial, cold shrew!I really liked the other Knight books in this series, but this one just didn't do it for me. I liked ""The Duke"" the best, ""Lord of Ice"" is pretty intriguing, and ""Lady of Desire"" had me laughing aloud."
4,3.5 stars,"I don't know what happened to these characters. They both started out likable and then as soon as they hit England something bad happened. Eden was such a selfish, shallow, unforgiving woman that I began to dislike her. Jack was quite insecure and let her walk all over him. He started off a very strong, yet understanding hero and then turned spineless. Could have been better."
2,only okay...get it from the library....if you're desperate,I've read A LOT of romances -- the good ones in one evening. I read this one in 5 days. YAWNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN. Predictable story line; boring sex scenes; unconvincing love story. Disappointing.
3,These Games Stink!!,"Though the title may give the illusion of being 1000 exciting fun games for a bargin price it is not! The problem is the fact that the games are shareware, or demos of second rate games that usually make it only on to mega complilations like this so if you want a lot of good games, download some from the internet!"
5,A must for ballet lover,"Please disregard the ""one star "" review. It seems that was totally politically motivated. I've seen Les Ballets Trokadero live many times and they are always very enjoyable. The video is no exception. They are witty and dance with very good tecniques. A must for all ballet lovers!"
1,"Dull, contrived garbage","This is not the real Trockadero. Tricked into getting rid of the two founders, the general director eventually named Tory Dobrin artistic director. This power crazed master manipulator then proceeded to ruin all that Trockadero was. The personalities, the jokes everything fun was taken away to create the worped vision of a non-talented, completely inexperienced former drag queen. Save your money, go see Ballet Grandiva! Unless you want to see men trying to be ""real"" women or ballerinas. If they haden't been around so long, they would be long gone by now. I suppose they are still paying off their frivilous lawsuite fees against other companies. I believe they lost half a million $ or more. Good work Gene McDougle."
4,good for fans or newbies,"If you already like Calexico, you'll enjoy this EP. It's all good, solid Calexico sound. In particular, the song ""Convict Pool"" is majestic. I was listening to it this morning, amazed they could make so much sound from just a nylon-string guitar and a drum kit. John Convertino is one of the coolest, most interesting drummers in rock today! I also really like ""Corona"", a Minutemen cover. The other tracks, both covers and originals, are pretty standard Calexico fare. The El Kabong video is a nice bonus, but not something you'll listen to over and over like the cd.If you're new to Calexico, this is a good place to start, but i think the album ""Feast of Wire"" is significantly better."
5,"Charming, the way only Calexico can do it","Like much of Calexico work, this album has a way of growing on you. The first time you play it, you may think, ""Oh, this isn't half-bad. I'll just finish out listening to it this one time..."" Then a dozen spins later you realize that you just can't stop listening. Every time around, you'll find a new inflection of the guitar, a new inspiring line. Gracefully, it will crawl into your heart and make a cozy home in there.This album's production is not as refined as their better known albums, such as Black Light and Feast of Wire, but the rougher studio sound only makes this more charming and endearing. It adds that feeling that perhaps you are not listening to a CD, but are rather fortunate to catch Calexico in a small bar, and Joe Burns is playing his guitar just a few feet away from you. And, really, Calexico is a band that should be enjoyed live.Yep, I'm in love with this."
4,Very Good and Helpful Book but,"it needs to be updated. My copy of this book is helpful but I find that there are websites that no longer work and some of the information is outdated as well. Much has happened in the online world since it was written so I came to Amazon.com to see if there was a newer updated version that I could buy. Alas, there seems not to be one."
1,Total waste of money,I bought this book for $2 + shipping and even that price is too much for what this book is worth.Save your money.
2,Wayyy too simple a book!!!,This book is too easy. All of its topics are so obvious. I felt like I was reading things I already knew!!! I think everyone could benefit of any other complicated book.
4,"Nights of Terror, Days of Excitement","This is a collection of Steve Frazee's short stories. They run the gamut of exciting, to creepy, to oddly humorous, to poignant. Each of the tales is well written, with intriguing characters shaped out of classic archetypes. I suppose my favorite piece is the eponymous ""Nights of Terror"" in which Something is slaughtering folks in the dead of night. A rousing adventure story, which manages to be eerie and fun. Highly enjoyable."
1,Cornball rehash of old newsreels,These videos are a real disappointment. HISTORY CHANNEL insults the intelligence of the average man by putting them out as serious history. The photography is especially poor and obviously not much thought was put into the project.
3,"colorless ""watercolors""","While the stories are wonderful as always, I bought this volume based onthe comment ""that the illustrations had a lovely watercolor like effect"". I guess I just don't see shades of gray as watercolor.I do appreciate the masters of black and white illustration, but children really do not. This is the last book I buy that is not better identified as having black and white, color or both illustrations. What is inside the book should be made aware to the buyer. Otherwise the savings to be had and the fun of the online hunt become moot, when opening the volume in hand at a bookstore will answer all your questions. I LOVE those sellers who are open and honest enough to describe their books in detail down to the number of illustrations, including how many are in black and white or color. I will buy from them even if their price is higher. Showing a cover or illustrative example is also a nice selling point."
1,20 TALES BY DANISH MASTER STORYTELLER,"Over the years I have enjoyed many HCA fairy tales, particularlythose which are not too tragic and appear as beautifully-illustrated picture books. But I must admit to being disappointed by this Harper anthology which is not all inclusive). The tales vary in length from rather long to absurdly short. Despite the author's occasional subtle humor he intrudes too much of himself into many tales, as if readers were really interested in hearing about the actual storyteller. One wonders if he were trying to curry favor with royal patronage at times. Some tales are brutal or grisly; others seem legitimate pleas for social reform. His favorite themes for general moralizing depict the dangers of excessive: greed, violence, and vanity. Was HCS trying to instruct or entertain his young readers?"
1,"Works, But That's About It","I bought this because I wanted a headset at a low price so I could use my phone ""hands free"" but I ended up only using it once or twice because of the reasons listed below.Pro'sWorks, decent sound quality. Cheap Price.Con'sNot comfortable, cheaply built, would not buy again.Read my reviews - buy with confidence"
2,I didn't like this product,The container is not easy to spray and after brushing your hair it leaves white scams.Not very charming for your look.
1,Waste Of Time,Made my skull itchy and my hair dry. It does nothing to protect against humidity.I wasted 6 bucks on this at Walgreens. Do not waste you money on this.
1,it was the worst film i had ever seen,"the only reason why i had seen the movie was because my cousin kevin mead was in the film.everytime i see kevin i let him know what a bad movie that was, and the acting was the pits.and then we sit and laugh about how dumb it was. at least we get a good laugh out of it."
5,Very good book,"A revised edition of a classic book on hiking San Bernardino mountains. This new edition of the book includes key GPS way points and multiple tables of the various hikes to make finding a hike that matches your criteria as easy as it could be.Furthermore, the descriptions of each hike are sufficient to permit the reader to determine if the hike would be of interest.The book concentrates on San Bernardino but also covers the Santa Rosa hikes more extensively than I have seen anywhere else."
3,Adequate if you don't expect too much,"This book did provide a ""portfolio"" of photos of fences and gates as advertised, however, it repeats many of the photos in various sections of the book. If you are grasping for ideas and need a reasonable number of photos for inspiration, this book may be adequate. If you are looking for a wealth of photos, it may not be the book for you."
1,Fence and Gate Ideas,"ISBN 0865739927 - If this book was a magazine, it would be earning itself a 4 star ranking. As a book, it's almost a joke. For 10 bucks, it's a bad joke.With very little text and repeating photos, it's Fence and Gate Ideas for the Homeowner with a Short-Attention Span. The photos are lovely and present some nice ideas. Unfortunately, that's the total value of the book - some pretty pictures. The text is not particularly informative, but it does provide some basics.Of course, the greatest problem with this sort of book (even if it had been a fantastic book) is that things become outdated. A magazine on the topic, something printed last month, is far more likely to yield useful, current info. Let the kids cut the photos out of this one so that it's not a total waste.- AnnaLovesBooks"
5,"A great historical snapshot, and a great read for any student of counterinsurgency.","Galula is able to present his experiences in a manner which is both analytical and intellectual, while being enjoyable to read. The book sheds light on the specifics of the French pacification effort during their conflict in Algeria. Anyone studying counterinsurgency in general should read this book, as his approach cuts to the core of idea."
5,A GREAT CD!,"IF YOU LIKE KIX BROOKS, THEN YOU WILL LIKE THIS! ITS HONKY TONK'N MUSIC, BUT SWEET! THE BREAK UP OF THE TWO WAS TRAGIC, BUT LIFE ROLLS ON."
1,Kix Brooks,This CD is meant for die hard Kix Brooks fans only. Thank goodness Ronnie Dunn came along.
2,Could Have Been Better,"The routine is good. The Production is Absolutely Horrible. I could have done a better job. His comments are not audible. He talks to himself.

4,Spiritual insight which can change your life!!!,"""Understanding God's Love"" provides the framework for a much deeper and profound understanding and recognition of God's love for all mankind. Mr. Greib has done an excellent job dissecting the often proclaimed ""wrath of god"" views of society and he presents, with significant biblical research, the true ""Unconditional Love"" that our Lord has for all. Of particular interest is Mr. Greib's detailed writings on natural disasters and the existence of evil. This book is a pleasure to read and has impacted my life with a greater understanding of God's love!"
4,Excellent presentation of our Lord and His love!!,"This book hits the mark!! Ron Greib has put together a beautiful book which explains the many misrepresentations and misunderstandings of God. He obviously is well read and provides excellent biblical references as well as providing a clear picture of God's unconditional love. A perfect book to make your everyday life much fuller, It has definitly has touched mine!"
5,"Inspiring, Impressive, and Comphrensive Biblical Study",This work is bound to become a Christian classic. Tremendious biblical insights are throughly presented that I have found nowhere else. At last someone has put it all together.
4,An interesting book,"""To be truly human means to act out, in every moment of our life, our faith in God's total and unending love for us"". I have gathered many valuable thoughts to ponder from this informative book. If you are looking for God's love, this book may help you, with its insights, including the explanations on the story of the prodigal son."
5,Powerful Bible Insights Regarding God's Love,This is new and groundbreaking. This is a spiritual masterpeice!
1,Bad psychedelic garage music,"The previous reviewer failed to notice that ""Buck Dharma"" is the title of the album. The artist is Wooden Wand & the Vanishing Voice. No BOC Guitarist here. While there is some originality and a little bit of talent here, it is obscured by lo-fi recording quality. It sounds like it was recorded direct to cassette through a pair of headphones in someone's bedroom. Don't bother with this one."
5,good,"The book ""Tumors of the central nervous system (Atlas of tumor pathology)"" is one that i wanto to have and to read. thank you for an exact and rapid delivery. I love it!"
2,"Good idea, just not for my dog","When I heard ""everlasting"", I was excited to see if my 75 pound Boxer/Lab mix would finally meet his match. I would estimate to say that my dog had the treat removed from the ball in under 10 minutes of constant chewing/slobbering. About 30 minutes after that, the treat was gone!!However, I did find a more adquete use for this ""everlasting"" treat machine. The blue ball that the treat sticks in is just great for my dog to chew on. There are are slots on each side, shaped like an X. I found putting other treats (i.e. piece of a milk bone) into the center of the ball provided much more enjoyment for my dog. He has to roll it around, chew on it, slobber on it and use his paws to get the treat.Still, it's not everlasting, but I suppose every breed could have a different response to the treats. If not for the extra use of the blue ball, I would have rated 1 star, but I'm still getting some life out of it."
3,Did not last,"I bought 2 of these for my dogs. My German Shepard got the treat out of the ball under 15 minutes. Eaten completely in 30 minutes. It's taking my Golden Retreiver a little longer. Her plan is to try to destroy the ball in order to get the treat out. I don't have hopes that it will last. I was planning on tossing one in the crate when I went out but I don't think that would be safe for my dogs. The treat part is so big that if they tried to swallow it after they removed it from the ball, it would get stuck in their throats. $40 later I feel like I've wasted my money."
4,Good But Not Great,"We use the Everlasting Treat Ball on an ongoing basis with our Shiba Inu mix. She's a delightful, smart, energetic mutt that bores easily. The ball is a good, sturdy product and one of the toys we leave for her when she has to be crated. She really enjoys it -- will bat it around and then hold it with both paws and gnaw away contentedly. The only down-side is that it just doesn't take her as long as we had hoped it would to finish the treat. That being said, some distraction-time is definitely better than none!!!"
5,Every dog will enjoy this toy\treat,"I have 3 of these treat toys and my pup loves them! If you have a smaller dog even the bigger size is great for them , more of a challenge."
3,Not bad for powerful chewers,"As with the large one, the big treats are very hard to get into the ball. I have had to use a screwdriver to get them in and sometimes it just doesn't seem worth it. At first I though this was a wonderful idea, until I tried to get the large treat in. Really haven't used them in a month or so because it takes so long to get them set up."
2,more work than you want,the price is right but you lose so many bristles while using it that you spend more time cleaning up black plastic bristles. i should have read the reviews posted. i would have spent more for a better quality brush.
3,Works well,"Inexpensive billiard brush. Leaves a bristles behind pretty often, but it does the trick. Inexpensive, arrived pretty quickly. So-so on recommending this brush though."
4,Bristles come off on the table,"Well it picks up the cat hair, dust & everything else that the outside air blows on it. BUT the bristles of the brush do tend to come off, not extremely bad. For $5.00 I can't complain!"
1,Defective - zero stars,The brush lost its bristles with each sweep.. luckily amzn makes it easy to return defective products.
1,Didn't do the job,"I bought this product as my pool table got dusty after someone left the cover off of it for a couple weeks.The good.1. Arrived ontime and looked like it should work2. Pick up some stuffThe bad1. The bristles came over all over the pool table2. Didn't get everything...took a long time to clean a little area.Overall.Save your money, I ended up pulling out my small vacuum and just cleaning it that way."
2,Not for preschool children,"The scenes in the art work are not very appropriate for small children. One double page spread shows the graves and grass above ground and the dead bodies and bones below. This could really frighten a child if they have ever lost a loved one or gone to a funeral. Just a warning to parents who may be concerned about having to answer their child's questions. If you are wanting to help your child learn the alphabet, there are other, much better books."
4,Nice crate,"This crate is a good value for the money. One of the latches is a little hard to work, but other than that it's a good, sturdy crate. Shipping was SUPER fast!"
3,Ok kennel,"The item was shipped and had a bent door making it hard to open and close, it would be nice if the tray had something to keep it in when on the kennel otherwise it can just slide out when the animal moves it."
2,Disappointed,Product received in a very timely manner and was easy to assemble. Happy with the plastic pan in the bottom vs metal - however after using for less than 2 months now am finding the finish on the door latches is gone and they are rusting as well as other connecting joints are showing signs of rust. Wondering now if the finish on this item is SAFE for my dog! Also when my 6 month old labrador retriever moves around in the crate some of the connections holding it together come undone. Needed a folding type crate for transporting & will be looking for something new.
3,Large Midwest dog crate,Delivery was very quick!! I was surprised and impressed that it came in 3 days even though I ordered regular shipping.I was disappointed that the kennel wiring was bent on one side and the side door was not aligned right so it is difficult and tricky to close the side door. I originally ordered a smaller midwest crate and I received it in great condition but my dog outgrew it so I ordered this bigger one. The size is great but it does look like it may have been returned by someone and then sent to me. In this I was disappointed but I had already thrown the box away since it was torn anyway so I did not bother with the hassel of returning the crate. Had the box been in good condition I would have returned the crate for one in new condition.I do like the Midwest crates and was very happy with the smaller one I had purchased previously but I am not so happy with the condition this bigger one was in when I received it.
5,Nice size,I got this for my Basset/dauchsund mix and its big enough for ever. it fits nicely in the room and seems it will last for a while
3,Best Price but defective,"It's a best price of this model on the internet. However, there's a defect on one of door locking pins making it so difficult to lock the door. It's a miss alignment by a few mm. I don't return it as it will cost me a lot for return shipping. I'll buy from the store where I can see the unit next time."
3,Could be better...,"Not real bad. Bottom lock on both doors are not lined up that well, so they are tougher to latch. There is no place made in it to attach the two handles. It would be nice to have a place on each end they fit and don't get in the way. Finally, I had to add some zip ties to keep it together well enough to keep out 7.5 week old 16lb puppy from breaking out of it, so that alone looses a whole star."
5,Dog crate,The crate was exactly as it was specified online. It was less expensive than any comparable item anywhere else online. I am completely satisfied with this purchase!
3,MidWest cutting back,"The strength of this crate is less than that of crates purchased from them four or five years ago. After just a week, my little 40lb puppy is bending the product out of shape. I've always been incredibly satisfied with their product, but will now be looking much more carefully for more durable crating in the future. This product will work, but I shouldn't have to take pliers to bend things back together every few days."
5,Awesome!,This item has been great! I love the fact it opens from two sides. It is holding up great!!
5,Large dog crate for two Whippets,"We unfolded and set up the crate very easily and quickly. The instructions were clear and simple--the construction quality good. It is sturdy for our dogs, yet light enough that we can move it with minimum effort. All details of the crate precisely matched the internet description. The crate fully met our expectations.Also, as an added bonus, the dogs love it and its roominess. During the day, we keep an ""open-door"" policy, and they rest in it at their leisure.Thank you for good service!"
3,"okay, as long as your dog isnt too bright","I got this for our husky mix, to house train her. It worked fine until I came back one day to find she had broken out of it. The crate is collapsible and the method of securing the walls when erected is a little weak. All our dog had to do to get out was to pull the wall towards her and the thing popped out.That said, I fixed this with a couple of zip lock straps on each wall."
3,Folding Dog Crate that folds a little too much,"The crate is ok, but on two occasions our young lab has been able to break out by somehow folding the end of the crate inward and getting out. Not the worst thing that has ever happened, but not something I would expect."
3,My travelling pooch!,"I have two other Midwest kennels, so when I decided to look for another to put in the back of the truck, I wanted a Midwest. They come in black now which is great. Ease of setting up (no piecing together, just unfold) is great. However, the gauge of the material is not as sturdy as the older ones. It is sturdy, just not as sturdy. I would recommend this product."
4,great crate,Have nothing but good things to say... We love it and our new lab puppy loves it. Would tell anyone to get it.
4,Dog Crate,"This dog crate is excellent. We have 3 pitbull grand dogs and this crate is so large, all three can fit in there. The separation piece is nice as well if we ever want to keep them apart when crated. Easy assembly and having the handles to carry it with are a great plus as well."
4,Very Versatile!,"I selected this crate after a lot of research. I keep it in my living room for my min-pin & miniature schnauzer so I needed a crate with a side door. Even though I keep my two dogs in it, I don't use the divider panel that it came with because my dogs like to snuggle together. The size is perfect. A lot of other crates were too narrow. I also wanted one with the traditional front door as well in case I want to move it to a different location. My dogs love the crate! This crate was very easy to set up & is very well made, not flimsy at all. I also really like the black enamel finish. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the crate has these hooks on the bottom below the side door that stick out which is kind of a pain when I vacuum. It would have been much better if the company would have designed these to snap in place out of the way when the crate is assembled."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CRATE!,"I would give it -5 starts if I could. This ""value"" crate lasted ONE day, my dog was able to pull the wire on from the sides .... I am oh so grateful that he didn't got hurt , when I came home from work I found a 2 inch wire from the crate sticking out inside the crate ! HOW CHEAP IS THIS CRATE!? Couldn't returnedt because it was all damaged. I don't have a Tasmania devil as a dog just a regular 100 lb dog, this 40' crate is a joke. It was a waste of money."
3,Weak for 30lb puppy,"Our puppy was allowed to get aquainted with the new crate before spending any time alone inside. After spending only an hour or two at a time to get adjusted to the idea of being alone she managed to bend the wires on the walls, not the gates. The gates are strong and thick, very well made. Our little puppy managed to locate the weak points and pulled the wires inward from the top and bottom of the walls. Not only do I not want to endanger my puppy further but also it is of no use to anyone else."
5,GREAT CRATE AND SO EASY TO SET UP!!!,I had been searching for an X-Large dog create for our Lab who is 7 months old and 80 pounds already and couldn't find one big enough for him at a reasonable price that would fit in the area we had already have. Well I have to tell you this crate does the job! It is a great size for Gunner and he can now stretch his legs out when he is in there and I dont have to feel bad if he has to stay in while I am at work due to weather. I absolutely LOVE the two doors because it gives you options on where you want to put it and for your dog to get in and out. I would defenitely recommend this item to a friend!
4,PERFECT,"Great price,beats the pet stores. You'll love the idea of 2 doors. Easy to fold up and transport or put away. The divider is a necessity--wonderful to have. It grows with your dog."
5,great crate and price!,"I looked for a few months before ordering from here and was hesitant to buy a crate online b/c the shipping was outrageous. But I not only got the best price for the size of crate I needed, but also got free shipping and we couldn't be happier. Our dog is very comfortable in his new home and it is easy to collapse and clean."
5,Long lasting,"This crate has held up very well! I am still using it and its like new! Very sturdy product, Thanks"
3,Not so metal,"Very happy with the cage aspect of this item, however, I searched and searched to make sure I purchased one that was all metal. Unfortunately, the pull out tray on this one is not metal and therefore my dog ate it the first day. Had that part been metal as believed, this would e a perfect item. Still works well and happy with purchase, just no pull out tray for easy clean up anymore."
3,good price but not impressed with the quality,First the pro's: the price was really good and the cage shipped quickly. It was easy to assemble and get set up.The con's: the sides of the cage do not fit together well. I'm not sure if it got bent in shipping or was just not manufactured to a high quality standard. I have had to use a couple of zip-ties to hold the pieces in place. It's not quite bad enough to send it back (because I needed the cage right away) but I don't think I would order another one of these. I wish that I had spent a little more to get a better quality product.
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought the 30"" x 21"" x 24"" size Midwest Life Stages Double-Door Folding Metal Dog Crate. Unfortunately, the door on the 30"" side was bent, and the door on the 21"" side did not close properly. This is the first time I've bought a crate less than $70...now I know why. It was a great price and I thought it would be an okay crate, but the quality isn't there. This is going back. You get what you pay for!"
4,Woody's New Home,"When we adopted an adolescent terrier to live in a condo, we knew he would need a crate. We read reviews before choosing this one and decided to select it because of its height versus footprint ratio. We (and Woody) are completely satisfied with it, our only negative comment being the rattle of the door closure when we put it in our car but we're working on a solution to that."
4,Ships in item box not amazon box,"This item was meant to be a surprise (not a gift, but still, a surprise), but since it, unlike anything else I've ever bought from Amazon, shipped in the box for the product... there ended up being no surprise... I think there should be some notification when items are going to ship in identifying packaging.Other than that though, great crate..."
5,Great Crate!,"This crate has been really great for me and my GSP. I just started showing my pups so I break this down and set it up a lot (almost every weekend, both days). The plastic handles for it broke with my abuse but I didn't really want to use them anyway. I really like this crate and want to order another soon. This fits just snug and perfect in the trunk of my 1995 Lexus SC400."
4,Midwest Life-Stages 30-by-21-by-24-Inch Double-Door Folding Metal Dog Crate,This dog kennel was not very useful in crate training my puppy because she is crazy. But my first Jack Russell did well in one like this. This one is made well and easy to fold and store away. It still looks brand new.
5,Excellent,"Fast delivery. Fast, easy set-up. Sturdy. Comes with a divider. Top notch. Exactly what I wanted. Couldn't be happier with this product."
4,"Great product, poor shipping method","The product itself it great and exactly what we wanted. Unfortunately, during the shipping process one of the corners was pretty dented and damaged to the point where it sits a bit funny on the ground. Since we have carpet it's not an issue but had this been a smaller/lighter item we would have definitely returned in through Amazon. I think many people have experienced this issue so Amazon really needs to figure out a new way to ship these products without issue."
5,Excellent product for a great price!,"This dog crate is easy to assemble and the double doors make it very versatile. You can put it up against a wall or in a corner and use the end door or the side door. The plastic pan slides out easily for cleaning. We are using the divider for our puppy and it is very easy to adjust the amount of space she has to lay down in. Our puppy is a border collie/red heeler mix, and this 36"" crate will be the perfect size for her when she is full grown."
5,Great Crate and Great Price,"I bought this crate for my greyhound, and am very pleased! It came in two days, and only took me about 5 minutes to set up. It is very sturdy and much easier to put together than the crates with all separate pieces. Well-worht the money!"
4,Dog Kennel,"This was a gift for a kennel which was destroyed by my dog when I borrowed it. The destroyed crate cost much more and wasn't nearly as durable. I, and the recipient, are pleased with the product and would recommend it."
2,BEFORE YOU BUY...,"This crate was cheaper than most other crates but after I opened it, I saw why. Let me preface that I have put these crates together before and know how to make minor adjustments if needed. The doors latches were extremely hard to open and close. Some of the exposed joints were a bit rough and had signs of wear right out of the box. Maybe it's a fluke and I got a bad item, but for me, I'll go elsewhere."
5,Fast and Easy Transaction!,"Fast and Easy Transaction! Delivery was very fast. Product is extremely easy to put together! Does exactally what you need it to, and does it well! A little heavy is the biggest dowfall."
4,Great crate at a great price,"This product is exactly what we needed for our 9 month old lab. He's between 75-80 pounds now and still has plenty of room to grow. Having two doors has been great and it was easy set up. Haven't traveled with it yet, but expecting that will be easy, too."
4,Good kennel,This kennel works great for my dogs...however the top latch often gets stuck and it takes a lot of pulling to get it open.
4,Great size for a frenchie,"I bought the medium for my french bulldog and it fits him perfect. The price is great. I only use one door, and never used the ""life stages,"" but as a normal, everyday kennel, it does it's job!"
2,Houdini Escapes,"I bought this product to limit access to the house when I was away for a few hours for my 8 month old boxer... Rockyfeller has been sleeping in this crate for 2 weeks without the door locked so he would be comfortable enough when I decided to lock him in.... so the first night I locked the door was when I went grocery shopping and when i came home I walked into quite a mess.... he was able to break down the front of cage where the door is positioned.... I ended up wrapping building wire around the edges because the ""clamps/hinges"" around the frame did not hold in place....I should've purchased a Hard Plastice Kennel instead...."
5,Bigger then i imagined,"So i just bought this cage for my pitbull. Shes full grown and is crate trained. WE were borrowing a crate and had to give it back. So i found this one. Paid 55 dollars for it and that includes shipping. This thing is huge. I got the one that is 36"". Now any other company that says the cage is that size is nuts. This thing is tall and roomy. Compared the one we were borrowing anyway. The only thing i will say is the pan for the bottom seems a little cheap but who am i to complain. My dogs happy and confortable. She can stand up and not hit her head. Lets put it this way, a grown adult could get inside and sit fine. So, if your dog is about or under 3 ft tall sitting up, then get this cage. plenty of room. or if you have 2 small yappers then this is good too!"
5,Midwest life stages double-door folding metal crate,I am very happy with the crate I purchased. It is made very well. I also like the divider for growth. Well worth the money and fast shipping. Thanks
5,*The best dog crate*,I purchased this dog crate for my growing german shepherd. I particularly like the divider while we are still crate training. Having the option to use more than one door is perfect! Not to mention the pricing on this unit.We are very pleased.
5,Great but size could be a concern for some,This is a very sturdy/ well built dog house coming with a small slide like structure allowing you to limit the inner crate size. I am getting it for a small Labrador retriever puppy. And the only problem that could arise for some is the capacity/ space it takes up. I ordered the third biggest size and was expecting something smaller. But amazon people surprised me once again!!
5,Dog create,This is a great dog create. Very well made and seems to hold together well. I would buy another one of this brand.
5,A very nice crate,"This crate is very well made. We bought one and then, due to a death in the family, had to immediately take a trip with our dog and this crate. It was folded and unfolded numerous times and was a breeze to deal with. About the only things I don't like about it are:1. The hinged clips that hold it closed when it's folded up kind of dangle in front of the crate while it's set up. Even when we push them in out of the way, the dog ends up causing them to fall back out when she jostles the crate getting in and out.2. The handles used for carrying the crate when folded are kind of cumbersome to cope with when not in use. Easy to lose.Otherwise, we love this crate! We especially love the double door feature. Having a door on the front AND side proved very valuable on our trip when our space was limited. And it really came in handy when we adopted a second dog and needed to put the crates side by side in a narrow area.This is a very versatile crate."
5,Great Dog Crate Value,I was expecting a decent dog crate but have been very pleasantly surprised at its sturdiness and ease of use. It is the perfect size for my year-and-a-half Lhasa Apso. We leave the door open for him and he uses it as a refuse on his own! I expect to purchase another for an additional dog in the next two months.
5,Satisfied.,Just what I expected and have had no problems with it. Easy to assemble and pan cleans easily.
4,Good quality,The dog crate is good quality. The metal used is thick enough so it doesn't flex too much when my dog pushes against it. The assembly was a breeze and I like the 2 door feature. It also came with a divider panel so you don't have to buy a smaller crate and then move up to a larger one.
3,Dog Kennel,This Product Was Good For My Pitbull She Has Space To Lay Down. So I Told My Sister To Get It For Her Dog So She Did. The Only Problem Was That The Hinges Pop Out And She Escaped.
1,DO NOT purchase for strong dogs!!!,"I have a 30lb pit bull who was able to break out of the crate door with minimal effort. I secured the door with bungee hooks, and the top with extra D hooks. She ripped the plastic crate liner to bits. Its a flimsy piece of plastic that will easily crack if flexed. This crate may be perfect for docile dogs or old dogs but a strong breed like a pit bull needs something more sturdy. That said, if anyone knows where I can get a metal crate pan, please reply to this post."
1,Killer crate,My chihuahua strangled himself inside this crate!!!!!! He was able to get his head between top and side and was unable to free himself. I came home and found him hanging inside this crate!!!!!!! Wish I could give it a negative 0 star!!!
3,Cage floor delivered broken...,"The product was delivered with a crack down the side of the plastic floor... However, since the floor still fit/worked properly, we decided not to send it back--too much of a hassle and we needed it immediately."
2,Poor design and constructiont,"The design is poor, very difficult to fold and unfold. Construction is shoddy with ill fitting parts.The cheap plastic handles easily break.However, the wire crate is what it is--if you must buy it don't buy it with the thought in mind to frequently break it down and set it up again."
5,Couldn't do without it!,"We ordered this crate for our 7-month old mixed breed puppy when he outgrew a smaller crate that had been given to us. We were surprised to find one at this price, and pleased with what we got for the money. The crate was simple to assemble and even bigger than we thought it would be. We can leave the food and water dish in one end with plenty of room for Rocky-puppy to sit and stand comfortably, or curl up on his blanket for a good nap. He goes into the crate willingly when we have to leave him, and we feel confident that he is safe and content while we are out of the house. All in all, we are very pleased with this crate, and wonder how we ever managed without it!"
3,dog kennel,Kennel seems sturdy only problem i had when it arrived was that the kennel top was bent. Took some tools and fixed it now it works great. So would have given five stars if not for it being bent
2,Left a lot to be desired,"We ordered this crate after reading several great reviews and looking at it in Petco. It seemed like a good quality crate, however, when it arrived, there was rust spots on the crate, the locks won't work because the lock bar and the hole don't line up and the crate was already bent and didn't align well. It was pretty disappointing and I would not recommend that anyone by this crate or products from this company. It was wobbly and not very sturdy. Not something that I would feel safe leaving my puppies in."
3,Safety issue and arrived broken,"I did read in some review that this kennel arrives broken and that the dogs teeth can get caught in this kennel. Both this things happened to me the kennel was not badly damaged ( the plastic plate was cracked and some of the metal bars were bend). The main concern is my dog's teeth getting caught in the kennel lucily this happened when I was home my dog was screaming very loud and lucky he didn't suffer any injuries, but what if I wasn't home that day?"
2,"Good size, tray easily broken","I bought the largest size with the divider for my Doberman puppy. The crate pops up easily and the divider made it the right size, but after one week the plastic tray already has a hole in it. There is no way this tray can support an 80 pound dog if an 11 week old, 20 pound puppy can break it! Now I have to try and find a sturdier replacement tray which will probably cost as much as the crate itself. I would have given this a high rating if the tray wasn't so cheap."
4,useful,"I like how the crate has the divider that I can adjust myself. It can be a little clumsy especially if I'm carrying it up and down stairs. When I roll it across the floor (there are little wheels on the bottom), it doesn't scratch so that's a plus. For me, I find it a bit too heavy to carry, but that's about my only negative."
4,Good value,I found the crate to be well built and a good value for the price that I paid. The divider allows me to make the crate just big enough for her as she grows to discourage her from soiling her bed. The tray is a little flimsy and would be better if it was more sturdy but it hasn't been a problem. I bought the biggest model and since I have a lot of room and a big dog it was ideal but I would recommend measuring the space you plan to put it before ordering it.
5,Just plain great,Shopped online and in stores. This was without a doubt the best buy for quality and price. Having PRIME made it a steal!
3,"Satisfied with crate, but.....","We love the crate, the size is perfect, and the double doors are great. However the tray arrived with a crack it it. I notified the manufacturer immediately and they promised to send me a new tray but so far it hasn't arrived. I am still waiting for it."
2,Don't purchase this crate if you have a destructive dog!!,"I purchased this crate in a larger size for one of my dogs and have been very pleased with it. So, I purchased it for my other dog who has a little separation anxiety and is destructive when he is alone. He lasted 4 days in it. He bent the wires and pulled a few off totally. He can get his head through the hole and now I am afraid to put him in it. Basically, it is useless to me now."
5,As described,Great crate. I have spent much more on same product at local pet store. Would def recommend. No complaints here.
5,Well-built and absurdly easy to set up,"Wife and I just bought this to house our brand new Corgi pup. Arrived flat in the mail, so I was prepared for some assembly, however, the whole thing just pops up in mere seconds - barely even had to look at the manual. Divider works great as well. We also bought a mat - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D7LCT0/ref=oh_details_o00_s01_i00 - to go with it and I was at first afraid the divider would have to squish it down, the bottom is actually a removable pan and there was enough room for the thick pad at the bottom. There are also a couple of detachable handles."
2,it's very pretty! and convenient!,"pros: it's very pretty! and convenient! sliding latches are easy for people to use and the dog did not manage to unlatch them. rounded corners are nice. we spent extra for the crate wheels.cons: after 3 weeks, 40 lb 10 month old dalmation mix puppy has chewed her way out. she broke the welds near the latches, but did not escape. she got her jaw trapped in the wires trying to break out. she finally started working on the side wall, which is thinner wire. she broke four wires and eight welds loose and made a 12"" hole. and that was that.caution - bottom of the crate REQUIRES that you use a pan. the wire spacing is extremely wide, far too wide. the bottom of our old crate was spaced closely enough that a towel or blanket would cushion the floor and no pan was required. I was disappointed with that, but willing to try the crate. unfortunately it didn't work out.great for well-mannered dogs."
4,"Good, but a little loud","This crate is a good size. It is large enough that your kids can climb in with a puppy if you don't stop them from doing it. It is also small enough to fit through doorways so you can move it from room to room. Although, it is a bit heavy. With 2 people it is easy to move, but not easy for me to move by myself. The two doors make it great for getting items in and out. It comes with a divider that you can put in for making it smaller which is really helpful so you don't need to buy more than one size of crate when training them to go potty outside. Only drawback is it is too loud to keep in a bedroom if you ever want to sleep. If the dog moves around you can hear the cage settle. And the doors are not silent when opening. But, really, this is me being picky. Once we moved the crate right outside of the bedrooms, everyone slept fine."
4,Excellent Pet Crate,I have now purchased two of these for some pets. Easy to assemble and mobile once you put wheels under them.
5,Easy Set Up,I found this very easy to set up. Within minutes the dog was exploring it along with a biscuit that I threw in it for good measure. I like the fact that it has two doors and carrying handles. The crate itself is very sturdy.Excellent product.
4,great product,"Great product, fast shipping(came a couple days after I ordered it with the standard shipping)I'm glad I didn't pay like $50 more for faster shipping. i thought it was a good price compared to PetSmart, but Lowe's has a kennel similar to this under $50. I never knew Lowe's carried items like this until I saw one today."
5,Great Crate,"got this for my puppy to grow into. box arrived with the crate folded up, it was easy to take out, handle, and put together by 1 adult. I have put one of these together in the past, so I was familiar with it. basically you just have to pull the walls tight to under the clips. once set up, my puppy would go in and out just fine and seems to like this much better than my old kennel cage that had solid walls. I purchased a ""Brinkmann Pet Weather Resistant Kennel Pad, 20-Inch-by-33-Inch"" pad to go with it, that I'm still waiting for. This crate is light enough to move around easily."
1,Arrived damaged,"This item was not damaged in shipping, it was packaged that way. The FedX guy was still in the driveway and I had him take a look - the pan for the bottom has a gash//crack in it and that makes it useless and frankly dangerous for a puppy.The gauge of the wires is superior to most, which is why I ordered it. However, due to it arriving damaged I had to beat feet for another one here in town and I'm not happy about that, not as sturdy.Sort of defeated the purpose of ordering to save some money and time. Yes it irritated me. Now I have to haul this thing in to return it."
2,Late. Hammered,Shipped a few days late. Box was absolutely destroyed and a couple bars were bent bad enough it wouldn't fold right until I bent them back. Tray was also cracked with a 3 inch piece missing.
4,Good dog crate,"Good price, good quality, double doors are nice, easy to set-up, snap on carry handles are convenient, the crate itself is not too heavy and not too light."
5,Just the right size for my dog.,"I like having the choice of which door opening to use, it aids in the placement of the crate in the right position."
4,Good Quality Crate,"My dog has been using this crate for about 2 weeks now. The instructions were easy to read and the crate was easy to assemble. It only took about 5 minutes before it was ready to go. It is well built, and seems very sturdy.The only reason why I'm giving this a 4 instead of a 5, is because the bottom latch on the front door is not very easy to operate, I have to lift up on the door to get it to latch properly. The other 3 latches all operate with ease. That being said, that is only a minor issue, I'm very happy with this product.I saved about $20 by purchasing it from Amazon versus in the local chain pet store. Very happy with this product."
4,Excellent value in dog crates,"This is the second Midwest crate I have purchased (dog is growing). I have been very pleased with both. Other crates for more money may be built of heavier materials, and if so, be a better choice for folks who haul their dogs around to dog shows, etc., but for containment in the house, and other light duty applications, you can't beat them for the money, especially with free shipping through Amazon. I cannot relate to the low ratings given by some reviewers as to dogs tearing up the crates. These folks are not crate training their animals properly, or else they have some mighty crazy dogs. Midwest crates are priced at less than half of any crates I have seen in local pet stores."
3,good value,this was a good value for the price. the wire is a little thin and not as sturdy as i would've liked but i love the double doors.
5,"Great for a Boxer, destroyer of worlds. lol","We have a 41 lb Boxer, and she has been recently getting into everything. Finally, my boyfriend and I broke down and decided to crate train her. She is a master escape artist, tearing her travel home apart in just a few hours, so we knew we needed something sturdy. This cage is perfect for her. The only thing I recommend is getting some soft padding for your dog to lay on. We keep her in there the entire time we are at work, a full 8 hours. Now we are happy to see our little girl when we come home. She loves to just go lay down in there too. I would recommend this product to a friend."
3,Doesn't hold together well,"Loved the price I got for this crate/kennel. Loved the fact that it had two doors. However, my dog can break out of it very easily. All she did was pull the wall with the gate back with her paw and it popped the entire wall back and out she climbed. She's only a 35 pound boxer/whippet mix. Not a big dog. My husband finally had to get the heavy duty plastic tie wraps and completely secure the entire top. Hopefully we will not need to fold it up."
5,Great Crate at a Great Price!,"We love this crate! It was very easy to assemble and it looks great. We needed to replace our dog's old crate because it was flimsy and he kept escaping from it. He damaged the latch on the old crate and we were using a combination of twisty ties and a combination lock to keep him in it. His new crate is very well constructed and (so far ) escape-proof. Our dog weighs less than 20 lbs so, we should have gotten one a little smaller but I think he kinda likes having a little extra room. My neighbor has one similar to mine but she paid almost twice as much for hers. I've recommended this crate to my friends who have dogs and my advice to anyone elso who needs a sturdy crate at a great price--buy this one through Amazon."
5,Great price for a fantastic product,The crate was easily assembled and seems extremely sturdy. The devider is a nice touch
4,good dog crate,"If you put cardboard under the tray, use zip ties to stablize the cage( for extra safety),locks stick a little but it is manageable, it is a good product. Not a perfect product but it worked well for our needs. Easy to assemble. Fair price. Love the double doors and divider."
3,Cannot put it together,"OK so this got to me very quickly but I have spent 55 minutes trying to put it together and have now given up. Other reviews said just unfold it and it's good to go and easy to set up but that is not the case at all. Yes you can unfold part of it and the front door opens but there are two pieces I cannot move from the base that make up the other door and the divider. I push pull and try everything following the instruction manual but cannot get them to move at all. Wish I could get some help with this! Good price, good size etc and I am sure it will work well eventually but I just cannot assemble it!"
2,"Poor Quality, BUYERS BEWARE","This crate came defective, the wiring on the rear of the cage was NOT welded which is very dangerous! Then the front door latch did not line up correctly to latch. Very disappointing. Don't be fooled by the great reviews, it's obvious this product is not of good quality or construction. I am returning this item, a big hassle to repack! and I've been waiting for a week now for UPS to show up to get it. I ended up going to the local pet store and spending more $$$, but I now have a crate of MUCH better quality and one that's much safter for my dog! You know that old saying, you get what you pay for. It's sooooo true!"
1,"worthless product, worthless seller","This product arrived defective. It is supposed to be a foldable wire crate. Well it is foldable even when set up. it is missing permanent parts that render the front of the crate worthless. The entire panel falls into the crate because it is missing 2 permanent pieces that hold it together.Beyond the disappointment and waste of time, the seller has been totally unresponsive.Next step is formal request to amazon to mitigate the problem.BEWARE OF THIS SELLER. DO NOT TRUST ANYTHING THEY SHIP!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"received 2 of them, both damaged","this is actually a good cage, folds nicely (a little tricky until you get used to it) but the tray it comes with was broken on both units...and amazon cant replace a single piece, so the send it back, receive another the same game commenced!I have a 6 month old boxer, he still fits in it at 50lbs and will probably continue to fit in there when he is fully grown.for the price, its a bargain! Dont expect an amazing product at under $35"
3,Watch your fingers as you assemble....,"Crate was exactly as I expected however I am not happy about the fact that I cut myself as I was putting it together. Some of the places where the metal has been cut to make this cage are extremely sharp. I called MidWest Life Stages, hoping that maybe they had caps for these ends where the metal is really sharp and they basically said I could just file down the places where there are problems. I don't think that I should have to clean up their shoddy workmanship in order to feel comfortable using this for my dog."
3,Door latches are mislocated,Pen is fine but the door latches are a material thickness offset so they do not engage the retention eyelet easily. I had to use a hammer to move it to the right position.
5,Midwest Double door cage,Very nice cage. Our pup likes the extra room it gives him. We like the double doors and the ease of cleaning.
5,I am sure it would have been great....,"I am sure that the dog crate that I bought from midwest would have been a great dog crate and would have worked wonderfully. the thing of it is that I never recieved the product.. of no fault of Midwest. They sent it FedEx, and FedEx lost it. Then said that it was delivered correctly even though I never got the dog crate. I would like to give a 5 star rating to Midwest on a great product and a quick turn around time from order to shipping, but a -10 star to FedEx for no delivery, bad customer service, and the fact that I am out 70 some odd dollars because they didn't have anyone sign for it. they said that because I ordered the crate on-line that this was my signature and they didn't need one on the other end saying that it was truely delivered. If at all possible I would like to urge whom ever is reading this to not use FedEx."
3,dog crate,The product is well made and easy to use. This is our first experience with a crate and I am pleased that my dog considers it a home. We also have confidence that the dog is comfortable and safe as well as there will be no damges when we return home. We ordered an oversize crate and are glad that the dog has ample room to stand and move about which is an added plus. The crate is easy to fold and move so the larger size is no problem.
5,Folding Metal Dog Crate,This crate has been a life-saver for me. When puppygets under my 75 year old feet I have an alternateplace for her. I have been very pleased with theconstruction and utility of it.
4,Good crate,"The crate I bought is of good quality. If you have a overly active or aggressive dog. I would recommend a little better quality crate. However, even with a hyper dog that is at least 40lbs. This product holds it own. It comes with 2 diffrent doors and folds flat for easy storage. I would recommend this product to anyone."
5,a perfect fit,"We have two dogs, but only previously had one cage. It wasn't an issue until our male dog started chewing up our door frame. So we wanted to get a second cage but needed them to be roughly the same size. Luckily, Amazon sells the exact match to the cage we already had.Before we got the second one, we used the front door option to the cage. Once we got the second, however, we needed to flip the cages to their side so they would fit in our basement. The nice thing with this cage is that you can do that because of the convenient side door option.Added bonus, the whole thing collapses and stores flat if you need to take it with you on a trip. The tray liner is easy to remove as well. There really is nothing I can say that is negative about this product."
5,Great crate for the price,"I do dog transports for a local rescue, and ordered 2 of these crates for my van. They fit side by side in the van and work great on the transports."
4,Puppy perfect!,"We purchased this crate for our Flatcoat puppy. I was attracted to this crate for the double doors and the divider panel. I also liked the fact that it folded open easily. The removal tray is fantastic and great for cleaning.Our last crate had awful corner pins that never went in correctly and once together the crate was flimsy. The Midwest Crate has been perfect for our growing, rambunctious puppy. It's very sturdy and handles his very active jumping against the doors. The only downside is the divider panel is a bit tricky to get in and out but once in, is as sturdy and the outer sides.We're getting a second Flatcoat puppy and I'm ordering another crate for him!"
5,Couldn't Be Better,This is the first time we ever tried to cage train one of our dogs and we chose the Midwest Life Stages crate to do just that. It is very easy to assemble and the extra wall to make the inside smaller for your puppy is a wonderful idea that really works. The odd thing that we didn't expect is that our Rocky loves to go into it to rest without us forcing him to.It has front and side doors for easy access and is fairly lightweight. This cage is definitely a good buy considering that the price of cages in the store versus Amazon is much higher in many cases.Not much else to say about this crate other than it is a must buy and it well worth the money.
3,Description Misleading--not compatible with table enclosure,"I bought this crate because in its description (specifically, the features table), it indicated this crate was compatible with the Midwest tabletop. Now that I'm ready to buy the table to go over the crate, I have discovered that 36"" Midwest table is only compatible with the 36"" iCrate, not the 36"" Lifestages crate. (The 42"" Lifestages crate does go with the 42"" table.) I've had the crate for a couple of months--too late for a return.If I decide to pay the $150 for the table to cover the crate, it will be an inch too short, leaving the wood legs dangling above the floor.Very frustrating to have been led astray by the product description. I surmise by the reviews for the table, I am not the only one who was under the mistaken assumption this crate would work with the table produced by the same manufacturer.Otherwise, I have no complaints about this crate."
3,works well enough,"it works well for my hound dog, Ryoko, all except the trey on the bottom. She got underneath it(because of her previous owners, who abused her, shes not crate trained yet and went nuts)and i have not used it since, but i will use it on trips. it works well to contain her on a trip, i cannot send her to a kennel or board her, shes my baby i even bought a sidecar for her."
5,great crate,This crate is perfect for our yorkie. She loves it and it is very easy to set up and move.
4,Great crate,"I've used these crates for a long time, and have always had a good experience with them. For those who are new to owning dogs, make sure you get a comfy bed for the pet to lay on otherwise this crate bottom will get uncomfortable very quickly. This particular type of crate is very good for traveling, and will last you a long time if you take care of it! These with the bottoms that slide out are also easier to clean than the full-enclosed styles. My dog definitely finds this crate more ""homey"" if I cover 3 sides with some sort of blanket. They like their little cave-home!"
1,From an Exhibitor... dont buy these.,"These are the worst crates I have ever owned. I bought 6 of these crates for home and travel (I have shown and owned dogs for 15+years). These crates are flimsy, the tabs ment to hold them together slip- two of these have collapsed with my dogs inside of them. I do love the size of these crates (more of a square than rectangle)but now have just zip tied them together to remain stationary. The clips that hold them together when they are folded bend and warp and get caught on everything. I will never stray again from precision."
5,Well built.,I ordered this for my 4 month GSP that will likely reach 60 lbs. The crate is well made and ready to assemble without any tools. Simply unfold the hinged sides and clip the front and rear panels to the top. Note that the divider is for allowing the pet more space as they get older. The side door is useless when the divider is in place so you will not be able to keep two pets separated in this crate and have easy access to both.
2,"Midwest Life Stages, average crate","Well, this is my second crate (a replacement) and I'm not pleased with the quality (AT ALL). The first crate was bent due to shippng and the new crate door hindges are not tight. The puppy scrathes at the door and the latch comes slidding across making it possible for him to get out when he is home alone. Also the crate has these latches that stick out next to the tray and are very annoying, things always get stuck on them, i.e. shoe laces, cords, tripping hazard!. They don't fold up and stay there. These are the latches to hold the crate closed when you are traveling or to fold the crate up and hide it away somewhere. The price was nice. But sometimes, you get what you pay for. I would not buy this product again. Nor would I recommend a friend to buy it either. I only kept it because it is a hassle to take this thing back to the post office to return it."
5,great deal and sturdy product!,"the midwest crate is both sturdy and well made. it is extremely easy to assemble..but i actually had a problem with it. one of the hooks just got jammed a bit. they had a helpline to help with assembling it and once they lady explained to me which one to unhook, it took just 2 minutes. (sometimes during shipping one of the hooks can jam). the helpline picked up quickly and was helpful.for the size of the crate, i think this is the best deal. my dog has grown too big for his old crate. he loves this new one. i keep a towel in it and a water bowl and that ll suit him just fine."
5,Best Deal,Found this to be very good quality made and also easy to open and close for storage. Mikey (my 6 month oldWestie) loves it for the security it gives him and the room to stretch out. I have a smaller one for traveling also (bought it at a retail store) which is not as stable. Pat
5,Good crate,"Lightweight, durable, easy to set up. My dog is a dobie mix weighing 58 lbs standing 24"" tall at the shoulders. He has plenty of room to move around and be comfortable at the same time. He is crated at night and does not mind sleeping in this crate. Highly recommended."
4,better than what i was expecting,"great crate, waaay better quality than i was expecting. feels very sturdy and seems it will last a long time and the divider is a great plus. only downfall was the packaging was horrible, the box was torn and looked weathered. besides that i would give the actually product 5 stars. definitely would buy from this company again (:"
5,Midwest Life Stages,This Kennel is HUGE!!! We purchased a 48x30x33 for an Akita puppy and to use when he is grown(110-120 pounds). I did not visualize just how large this would be- our 9yr (big guy for his age) 2 yr old son and puppy got in together -said it looked like a playhouse! I really like the divider it has been perfect to house train. The puppy loves it and goes to it to sleep. The kennel is sturdy and easy to assemble -our teenage sons put it together in three minutes. I highly suggest you purchase the casters (3x Midwest Universal Crate casters) so you can move it-we got six(two in a pack) as suggested by other customers with this size kennel- if you don't you will not be able to clean easily around it because it is so large to move. Give it 5 Stars- Great Value!
4,"The crate is good, the bottom tray is not so good","We used this to keep 2 puppies full-time in from the age of 3 weeks up to 5-6 months and part-time now, when they are 8 months old.I have no major issues with the cage. It was relatively easy to unfold, the wires are strong and the 2 doors are most convenient. They allowed us to set it up in a such a way that one door was open against a regular dog house while the other door was the exit. This way, our 2 puppies had a 2-room apartment with the crate as the dining room/living room while the dog house was the bedroom. It worked well.The only issue I have is the bottom tray. While it's convenient and allows for easy cleaning, the plastic is quite thin and, eventually it cracked. We are still using the crate and the dogs return to it to sleep at night - with the door open - but... the tray IS cracked and I expect it to completely fall apart within a month or 2. When that happens the crate will have no floor and we'll have to think of a solution."
4,Decent Quality,"It arrived and looked just like it does in the picture. I was able to set it up quite rapidly. I have a boxer and it is just the right size where she can turn around, etc. I bought this to allow my dog to sleep in the house during cold winter nights. However, I decided pretty rapidly it was easier to train her to just sleep in a spot in my bedroom without a Crate. I'm still happy I have it though, because I might use it for something else."
4,Not for all dogs in this weight class,I just adopted a 45 pound redtick coonhound and he cannot comfortably stand up in this size crate. He still has 15 more pounds to gain so I have to get the next size up. I'm forced to use it until the 42 inch crate comes in. Beware of the dog weight suggestions provided on the product page.
5,Was nervous but now pleased,"I was nervous about purchasing this crate for our new puppy (a Lab) because it was SO much cheaper than the others I've seen, I thought for sure it was going to be cheap and horrible. It's not. It's not the sturdiest thing I've ever seen in my life, but it's solid enough, all the parts work well, and it has served us and our dog well. Happy with this purchase. Also, FYI, we bought a microfiber bath mat from Costco (but you could get it anywhere of course) for 12.99 and it has the EXACT dimensions as this crate -- perfect insert! Soft, washable. Go Costco."
4,Midwest Dog Crate,"This is a good crate, I have bought 3 now and all still do the job. I think they are clean and simple to set up. They are easy to fold up and take along for travel with your pet. I like the 2 door design, it makes it easy to use in many locations and still have access to a door."
4,Great crate.. hard to find the right bed,"My dog is a chewer, so finding a durable bed is key for him (otherwise, one night in, and he's already ripped out the stuffing). Unfortunately finding a bed to fit this crate that is also chew-resistant has been a bit of a nightmare. There just doesn't seem to be any company that makes one (I've looked at the PVC lifted beds, found one, ordered it, and they suddenly quit making it in that size...). So, he's currently got a bed that fits half of the crate. If we could find the original source for his bed, we could get another, alas, the bed doesn't have a tag. The search continues.Otherwise, this is a great, durable, inexpensive crate."
4,Great Crate!,"This double-door crate is great for two puppies. The divider panel is good to decrease the roaming space while they're smaller. This helps with crate potty training. When they're good with the potty training and a little bigger, we can take down the divider and give them more room to get comfy. The crate is very sturdy and of good quality. It's a better quality crate than the one I bought 5-6 years ago at Pet-smart. It's perfect for a dog the size of a golden retriever, husky, or shepherd. We're using it for two Shih Tzu. The only thing I would change about the crate is the position of the doors. I wish the one on the long side was down at the other end instead of on the same end as the short side door. If it were, you could use the divider to separate two dogs when needed and have two doors to work with. Other than that one aspect (that isn't a big deal), this is a excellent crate!"
5,Nice and big,This is perfect for out bull dog. He stays in it when we leve the house for short periods of time. He does not seem to mind it. Great deal
3,you get what you pay for...,"not the best crate in the world...but you should expect to pay more for a better crate. it does the job, but the metal is not the strongest in the world. plus the insert is not the easiest to place. does the job? yes. would recommend? no. spend more money. buy stronger crate."
1,Cheap Made,"Very disappointed with this purchase, so I returned it. Cheap made and arrived defective. Not sure if all Midwest crates are like this. But, I ordered one from Crate Appeal and it's GREAT! Do not buy this crate!"
5,Works great for my Australian Shepherd puppy,"She's not up to about 22 pounds and growing and this is a great size with plenty of room to expand by moving the divider. I read some comments on dogs breaking some of the wires or otherwise creating a danger for themselves but this seems strong enough and the latches work fine that I don't worry about her breaking out. Perhaps a very violent dog could find a way to break a wire and create a danger but my dog jumped around a bit in it when we first put her in and it held up fine. I later bought a 2nd one for our bedroom with the first one being in our living room where she stays while we're at work. Seems like a fine crate at a very good price.The 2nd one had a cracked plastic pan that lines the bottom and I called Midwest directly and they sent me a replacement one that arrived within 3 days so I was impressed with their customer service (Angie was the rep, very nice)."
4,Nice dog crate,"We got this for our new puppy that is supposed to become a full sized 50-60lb dog. Currently we have the divider set in it so she only uses about a 1/3 of the crate currently. While using the divider you unfortunately can't slide the bottom tray out of the crate to clean it. The crate itself is pretty durable as since our dog is still a puppy, she tends to try and chew on things and I've caught her trying to chew on the bars some and they've held up just fine. Another sign it is very durable is its weight. It's heavy, which is good but not good for when you want to move it around. The crate folds in on itself easily enough which makes tear down and and setup pretty easy, its just the carrying part is a little difficult with the weight of it. Overall I'm very happy with the crate and my puppy should grow into it quite nicely."
1,This shouldn't be rated as highly as it is,"If this crate were cheaper, then the customer rating would be appropriate, but it's not much cheaper than others of the same size. It doesn't fold up very well, the door is bent (and I can't seem to get it straight) so i have to force the locks, and the hinge that's supposed to hold the pan in place drops down sometimes. After it fell one time, my dog was able to move the pan over a few inches, then scratch to bits a 6"" by 2' area of my hardwood floor.It works well enough, but it is not worth $92. go spend a few more dollars and get one that won't have issues."
5,Pomeranian,"It works really well for my Pom she is very confortable with the size. It was SOO easy to put together and get all set up within 5min It was up and ready for her to hop in. Even though she isn't very crazy about it, she does really well in it when it's time to get in it. I HIGHLY reccomend if you have a Pom or another pup that has as much energy that you get this or one just like it. I purchaced the Small size 22""L x 13""W x 16""H I LOVE It!"
5,Very pleased!,"I purchased the 36 Inches by 24 Inches by 27 Inches for a Pitbull puppy (3 months old), and I have to say I am very pleased with the ease of assembly.The divider bar was pretty hard to secure, but at least the dog can't unhook it.I researched the size that's appropriate for my dog when it is full-grown and this is the size I chose.I hope I don't have to buy another if she gets too tall, but I will gladly buy THIS kind again!The two doors is great, especially if you have to place it in an awkward area.My puppy is doing GREAT with learning the ""place"" command, place being her kennel.I ordered a mat to put in it.I highly recommend this!"
3,Good product - very poor packaging for something so heavy!,"I purchased this crate for my newly adopted greyhound. I thought the price was very good, and looked forward to receiving it and setting it up prior to his arrival. When the shipment arrived, the box was literally battered to death. The heavy duty copper staples were pulled out of the corners in some instances and, as I am sure you can surmise, some of the bars on the crate were now bent and took quite a bit of work to get them where they would lock into place as needed. The door locks still will not line up unless I push down on the top each time I put him in there. This manufacturer needs to seriously re-evaluate how they package such a heavy item for shipping. At the minimum, a much heavier grade cardboard and how about some corner supports to keep those from giving way during shipment? I literally could tear the cardboard apart with my hands. Not sturdy at all!"
3,It does the job,"This crate is average for the price.This is not the manufacturer's problem but when the crate arrived, the pan was dented and the collapsible sides were jammed under one another so hard that I had great difficulty setting up the sides of the crate.I believe, if the crate was a bit 'sturdier' this would not have been a problem. Essentially, you get what you pay for."
5,excellent,Great kennel. Good materials. Paint is heavy duty. Door latch is real easy. Little tuff getting the panel into place for interior reduction. Nice buy. Freight was supposed to be free. Guess I didn't choose the option at checkout.still a good buy compared to stores in town. Delivery was fast with no damage.
5,No problems here,This crate was wonderful for my Welsh Corgi puppy in house breaking him and now for him as an adult when we are away. It folds easily and fits nicely into out truck for travel. I feel safe leaving him in his crate when I am away.
3,Not as well built/sturdy as crates made by Precision,"I was hesitant to order this crate due to some of the negative reviews, but after seeing it at friend's house and thinking it to be sturdy, I did. It arrived today and when compared to the two Precision crates I already own, I can see where this crate would not hold up to a dog who is determined to get out. If you are just looking for a two-door crate for a dog who is already crate trained, as was my case, this crate will work fine. If you are the owner of a rambunctious pup, or a dog who suffers from separation anxiety, spend the extra $ and go with a crate by Precision. Even the plastic tray from Precision is of better quality and easier to clean."
3,It's just okay,Only good for small dogs and dogs don't mine being caged. If you have medium sized to large dog that doesn't like to be caged or has abandonment issues it will not hold that dog. The door latches can be opened by the dog inside if clawed at enough and walls can be pushed out easily.
2,Not good for large dogs,"I bought the 48""L x 30""W x 33""H for our bullmastiff/lab mix. She doesn't particularly care to be crated but it's needed to keep her out of trouble while we are out running errands. First time we left her in it she was able to bring the walls down and escape. We put it back together and started using cable ties on all the corners. Solved the escaping problem for about 2 weeks but then she bent the bars around the door up so much she's able to jiggle the door until it opens. I come home to a free dog with a slipper in her mouth. For a determined dog with any strength this is worthless and flimsy! I suppose it would be just fine for a smaller breed or a puppy."
5,Great kennel!,The kennel was just as I expected it to be. I have two little dogs and I have often thought it might be more fun for them to be together. It's working out great!
4,Great crate for the money!,"My little 10 pound xolo loves her new kennel. Lots of room for blankets for her to cuddle with, and roomy enough to move around a bit when she's in there for more than an hour."
5,Very portable,"This crate is very easy to colapse. It stores flat and requires no tools or corner pins. Great for all the time, or like us- at a vacation home!"
4,Overall effectiveness,"Overall I was pretty satisfied with this product, I have a pit bull and she weighs 53 pounds and she still has plenty of room to keep growing into it. The only negative is she chewed up the crate pan so I suggest finding a crate with a steel crate pan if you can find one!"
3,Broken,"when recieved the pan had a big crack due to the way the crate folds flat, a metal piece broke the plastic during transit"
2,Not durable at all,"I wouldn't recommend this cage for any dogs with reasonable strength. So far my black lab has broken out twice. The first time she managed to make the front part unlatch and fall in so to fix that I ziptied it all along the sides and top. Today I came home to find that she literally broke the main latch off the door, it snapped at the welds. So now I'm in the process of adhering that back on but overall I'm severely disappointed with this cage. She's been able to bend several of the bars in different locations so it's obviously not made out of the best materials but for the price I expected better."
3,Could have done without,"The other Bratz cds are better. This one lacks tune on some songs and sound alike. DVD is better. Songs such as ""Workin' Overtime"" weren't even in the movie, they were in other Bratz movies.Best songs would be ""Getting it Right"" and ""Ready to Roll"""
5,Simply Incredible Band,"I saw these guys come through my hometown a few years back... they were still strongly underground and DIY. I got the chance to talk to them a little bit and help carry equipment, as well as making a donation to a fund that the show promotors set up in order to help Sparechange pay for their broken down van. Their van broke down on their trip from their homestate of Ohio to Pennsylvania, and they ran back and got another car and hauled as much stuff over as they could. The show rocked incredibly as usual (I've seen them several times), and their music never ceases to amaze me. This band is GUARANTEED TO ROCK YOU.\-john"
3,Didn't see a difference,I didn't notice any difference in myself. I recently started taking B6 and B12 vitamins and find that they are working very well and are giving me what I was hoping for out of the Theanine Serene.
1,Didn't feel anything,"Felt nothing. Save your money. I live in the Bay Area. If you wanna try this, come pick up mine for free."
1,one star is too generous,"i took 2 and waited. later i took 2 more... next i took 2 more..etc. this ""supplement"" has had no effect whatsoever on me. i suspect it is just another of many,many placebos"
5,Durable and HULKness,The curtain feels strong and the colors are bright. The pic shows that the main color of the curtain seems to be purple but its more dark blue.
3,pleasant comic musical,"In this Bing Crosby plays an egotistic songwriter who hasn't written a musical for years. Charles Coburn is his producer. Bing's main problem is that he's lazy and would rather be golfing than writing so Charles hires a strict student (Nancy Olson) as his secretary. Other than the supporting role in Sunset Boulevard, this was of the few chances Nancy got to shine on the screen. She plays the stern girl effectively. Robert Stack is good as an annoying energetic jock who is interested in Nancy...only she's in love with Bing. Bing sings two versions of the song Love is Peculiar, one with Peggy Lee, another with Groucho Mark. It's interesting to see how the same song can be so different.A good 2.5 movie, rounded up to 3."
1,Definately Worthy in The TOP 5 HALL OF SHAME for Playstation One!,"This game is utterly ""Sucky"". Its no wonder this game arrived factory sealed and unopened when I bought it. I thought this game would be fun and a kick as game, but it turned out to suck beyond the imaginable! OMG! I cannot believe how bad this game is. Do not buy this game folks. Definately not worth it, It blows, and stinks.The movements of the celebrities are so lame and so not correct. If they had used the Smack down engine or even the street fighter engine, the game would have rocked, or even the Mortal Kombat engine.I hope the PS-2 version is better because this game is on my very bottom list. Getting rid of this game immediately. Sucks so bad..Thanks for reading."
3,Nice...not great,"I have been a fan of Rosana nevertheless i am more a Pop-Rock Listener, specially because of her deep lirycs.""La casa del sol"", ""Agítese antes de usar"" and ""Sé Feliz...es gratis"" are my favorites.""Soñare"" is a very motivational-romatic song with a good rhythm.She enters in the ""bachata"" world with ""Con el sol en la maleta""Rosana slowed down too much the music of this CD, it was nice..but not great."
3,Very useful for the music library!,"This is a very useful book to have, if you are involved in any way, with choral music. It's full of standard choral music, often used in traditional church services."
4,"Goofy concept, solid album","Bought this disk through BMG years ago after they did the big sell on it. The album is billed as the ""Greatest Hits from '69 to '99"" despite the fact that it was released in 1994. The liner notes are also an exercise in satire as well. I really had to smile about the band's sense of humor before I ever put the disk in the player, so, by the time I listened to it I was optimistic.I wasn't disappointed by the music at all.The band clearly had a mix of styles but they found ways to blend them in a way that makes them work. All in all, I'd call the album Hard Rock, but not the hard rock of the mid-90s. My personal favorite tracks are Takeover Baby, Armed Love, and The Liquor Talkin', but you have to enjoy ""Simply Barry"" (allegedly taken from lead singer Barry Hensseler's solo album ""The Sexual Intellectual"")."
5,Very nice!,"We we looking for something ""beachy"" that wasn't the obvious nautical or shell theme, and these are perfect. The color is much darker than in the picture, more of a deep teal than aqua, but the dishes are very beautiful and seem sturdy.Shipping was very quick, packaged well and there were no broken or chipped dishes in our shipment."
2,Traveling to Hawaii? Get another book.,"Generically written at best, Frommer's continues to fall short of its competitors in regards to Hawaii. This is the last time I'll purchase a Frommer's guide to any of the islands in Hawaii. The content is descriptive and thorough but the lack of illustrations and photographs makes the book rather dull and boring. Other books excell when Frommer's does not; as another reviewer hints at, don't waste your time with Frommer's unless you want a novel."
2,Dissapointed,I should have followed other reviewers advice. I expected more from this brand name of book. If I had only read this book I'd have never wanted to explore many of these places. Luckily I also had a copy of Revealed and Maui Mile by Mile.
5,took too long,"for price savings, i should have gone to the book store. i didn't save that much and i waited a while (which in my limited experience w/amazon orders is unusual) for the book to be delivered. the book, like most from frommers, receives the 5 stars."
3,Soft Ambience in Jeane Micheal Jarre's Style,"William Orbit's music is quite melodic in contrast with other popular electronic artists who mostly focus on beat and rhythm. This is a clear indication that melody is still and fashion and will probably always be in fashion. However, Orbit's music, especially in ""Strange Cargo"" is too soft and tender to be truly moving- the energy of beat is lacking, albeit, the pacifying and relaxing effect is present.True fans of electronic music must remember Jean Michael Jarre with his ground-braking synthesizer tracks and spectacular shows. William Orbit follows in his tracks and many of his sounds and overall ambient feel resemble some of the earlier Jean Michael Jarre tracks. If you are looking for more energetic, mood boosting music, you should also check out Van Dyk, Oakenfold, and maybe UltraMax Music. William Orbit have mastered the new age, and this is unquestionable. But the true dance music leads another way."
5,Electronica mastery from one of its pioneers,"If you only buy five ""electronica"" albums, Strange Cargo III should be among them. While some might criticize Orbit for being too unfocused, he really finds an ideal synergy between dancish beats so good they're practically hooks in themselves (Track 1, Water from a Vine Leaf, is a perfect example), and some of the more aethereal material one might expect to hear from The Orb. Highly listenable and strongly likely to cause one to want to order further Orbit albums (Strange Cargo-Hinterland being the logical next choice)."
3,It has its moments...,"...but it doesn't really work for me. I bought this album after hearing ""Best Friend, Paranoia"" on Peter Gabriel's _Plus from Us_ album (a compilation of musicians that contributed to his Us album).""Best Friend, Paranoia"" and ""Water from a Vine Leaf"" are admittedly great tracks, but the rest of it is mostly electronic filler. The disc sounds great (good production values), but the tracks aren't as memorable as they could be. Alas."
4,I Love This CD!,"I previously had this cd, and then I lost it somehow. I have a hard time locating it in the stores, so thank God for Amazon. This is one cd I cannot live without. I love the exotic beat!"
2,Beware recording too early ..............................,"She sings OK, but OK is not good enough these days. It actually sounds like she recorded too early when her voice wasn't strong enough.There's a rich tone and good control, just needing ten more years of singing. It would not surprise me if she's a great singer now but viewed as uncommercial because of this."
3,How service counts in the airline business.,"A nice collection of stories about how service counts in the airline business. American is the only legacy carrier not to go into bankruptacy and for people who wonder why, it is not leadership but the people providing customers with great care. Only when you care for your customer do you build a clientele who will buy your product. Other airlines failed to do this, but American has always done this.The book is a series of stories related by employees of how they follow that strategy. At the end, there is a story of the CEO (Casey I think) and how the base put him on the wrong plane. Casey ended up in Chicago rather than Washington. The stories are simple, service and care for your customer and they will reward you with repeat business."
4,Quality of Life,"You run into this neighborhood character on the street and ask, ""How's it going,"" and he always has a story. Hip, slick and entertaining, he's a big part of the neighborhood's personality. It's no wonder Dr. Duke Tumatoe is a beloved radio personality in the Wheat Belt. The band ... wowsa ... they prove they can play blues, jazz, swing and rock with the best, they prove it in brief, perfect passages and then get back to the story, which is that neighborhood character's story of the moment. Really cool stuff."
5,You've got the Problem - Dr Duke Tumatoe & The Power Trio,"When I first heard Dr. Duke's music, I was curious as to where this guy came from. I checked around and found out this guy has opened for Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy, John Fogerty, The Doobie Brothers, etc. This is a very entertaining cd. Another great cut on the cd is My Baby is a Nudist. Duke's got his mojo workin' on this cd!"
1,little value,"the psychology of trading is an extremely important subject. the author however attempts to explain certain occurences of trading range breakouts using fictional characters and situations, resulting in a book that is slow and repetitive, and has little practical value for the active investor. the author could have quite easily summarised his thoughts in a short magazine article, rather than a 250 page...."
1,No crowd psychology,"Really bad book. Title misinforms. No psychology whatsoever. Loose on details and evidence. Long winded. Unorganized. Should have stopped on page 1 first and second sentences: ""This book is not intended to be ... a scholarly, academically accurate thesis. Instead..., it is intended to describe my personal understanding of the importance of psychology in the stock market.""Abysmal writing combined with confusing make-believe characters and dialogue. Go buy Kindleberger's ""Manias, Panics and Crashes"", or Boucher's ""The Hedge Fund Edge"" for real insights into crowd psychology and behavior on your financial net worth."
3,delivery,"all the items i ordered were ok,but what was terrible (but it is not amazon responsability)is that my package was left outside ,in the middle of the street,under a heavy rain even if i was not home.But i was lucky twice ,because my neighbour found my items outside and also it was very well packaged so there was no damage...you should contact your italian delivery company.sincerlygianluca barocchi"
3,you get what you pay for.,"The lamp was well packaged for shipment and arrived in good order. It assembled quickly and easily. But. The connection for the bulb itself is not well executed. The design looks to be well-thought out, but the electrical path to the bulb is not tight. If my dog walks near the lamp, or just a gravity attack while the bulb is horizontal, the light goes out.A bit of gentle jiggling gets the bulb back in contact, but it is annoying.This has happened from the first time I turned on the lamp.The light, when it is on, is great."
5,Learning What is Really Important in Life,A beautifully written book set in the early 1900's around the mining business. It tells the story of a young man deciding on the priorities of his life. It shows all of us the true meaning of life. It's based on fact about the mining strike of that time and is a must for historical buffs!
2,A Little too sparkly...,"I'm not too big of a fan of this eye shadow. The colors look great over the computer, but once I got it it was aother story. It has a lot of glitter in it, so when I put it on, it went everywhere. And the glitter is big, it's not just a little shimmer, it eventualy got under my eyes and I basically looked like I was 13 and I'm 24! It doesn't go on very smooth either (due to the glitter). I wouldn't recommend this product at all. It does come in a very attractive eye shadow case though...lol."
1,Crushed,"The first time I received the wrong product completely & had to return it while I waited for the eyeshadow that I ordered. Once received, the eyeshadow was completely crushed, meaning the powder wasn't solid, it was crushed powder and fell out everywhere when opened."
4,Lucky Charms,I've been looking for the perfect green eyeshadow and came across Too Faced Lucky charms. I love both the colors. However I dropped mine and the shadows crumbled. Not enough to be ruined but just enough to make me say ugh.....
2,Don't waste your money on this one,"Since Amazon has no description of this DVD, I did some research and found it on another website. This DVD contains the unrestored (i.e., lesser quality) versions of three movies with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce - Dressed to Kill, Sherlock Homes and the Secret Weapon, and The Woman in Green. MPI recently released the fully restored (by UCLA) versions of these movies on DVD. The difference in quality is like night and day. These are good movies (I'd rate them 4 stars), so do yourself a favor and get the restored versions instead of buying this DVD. The restored versions more expensive, but well worth it. I've rated this DVD 2 stars only because it's not overpriced - you'll get your money's worth, but that isn't saying much in this case."
2,Mirror images flutter from car's vibration,You get what you pay for with this mirror. It works- but when you are driving there is a fluttering from the car's vibration and it is very noticeable. The mounting of the whole system is stable- its just that the quality is cheap and the mirror flutters. If that doesn't bother you- then go for it.
5,A must have in any personal Library!!!!,From the first sentence I was drawn into this book. I read it 6 years ago and purchased my own autographed copy and read it again. The story line is climatic and keeps you sucked in. I promise you will finish this book within 24-48 hours. Enjoy!!!
2,Nothing Outstanding,"There isn't anything outstandingly wrong with ""Child of God"", it just wasn't outstanding.In the beginning of the novel, the author throws so many characters into the storyline that by the time you get to the meat of the story, the reader's got the characters all confused. By the middle/end of the book, I wasn't emotionally invested in any of the characters; which is a shame because the author uses every dramatic tactic in attempt to pull the reader in.The story isn't told in chronological order. The multi-generational storytelling and over-dramatics makes this a draining read.This story is a lazy mix of ""Flowers in the Attic"" and ""Scarface"".I wouldn't prevent anyone from reading this book, I just wouldn't recommend it. What the writer's trying to do has been done already. In fact, it was perfected in J. California Cooper's ""The Wake of the Wind""."
4,Wow,"I recall my high school days of reading Hamlet when I read this book. It was carefully and concisely pened. The action was gripping but not too fast paced. Files makes the reader feel as if they are actually a member of the family or even a close family friend. This book is filled with tragedy, love unfufilled, and heartache. Tears ran down my face when I finally closed the back cover. Great job Lolita Files."
5,What a READ!!,"This book was by far one of my favorite reads of 2002. I truly enjoyed reading this book. Ms. Files takes the reader into a world of sexuality, voodoo, incest, childhood drama, mother/father relationships, drugs, and prostitution. This author does an excellent job of telling a story that you will never forget. Although some of the subject matters were hard to read about, I could not put the book down. I will now be a fan of Ms. Files. The Sister 2 Sister Book Club had a wild and fun discussion regarding ""Child of God"". I highly recommend this book to avid book readers."
2,overkill,"Take rape, incest, homosexuality, gossip, and general nastiness and force it all into one book with one set of tortured characters then you'd have Child of God. It was just too much misery and too much plot. This has to be the most depressing thing I've read all year."
1,AWFUL,"I have enjoyed other books by Lolita Files but this was the exception. I started the book trying to like at least one of the characters but honestly, what was wrong with these people? The only good male character in the book was killed off and all I can say about the women is that they all should have known better!! Between the innocence and violence, this book was garbage!!!"
5,These people have issues!,"I read this book in 2 days. What a gripping story! This book is a page turner from Page 1. Child of God takes you through the trials and turmoils of one family over several generations. It will have you feeling every emotion, every heartache, every disappointment felt by the characters. It will have you cheering for the underdogs - Ophelia, Grace, Walter and Coolie - and wanting to kill the bad guys - Lay and Sukie. The story is written in a way that you can actually imagine yourself being there and seeing the events as they unfold. Highly recommended."
4,Lolita Flies commands your attention!,"In this descriptive page turner, Lolita Flies captures the internal strife of incestuous secrets mixed with deadly outcomes. Page after vivid page, I found myself in awe of her ability to create depictive scenes given the horrific subject matter. Highlights include a poignant relationship between Ophelia and her love interest. Despite the turmoil in the book, if you can stomach the subject matter, this is a must read! Hats off to you Lolita Flies."
3,Very dark,When reading this book - I could feel the gloomy setting. I found this book to be a pageturner - but still kind of depressing.
3,Strange,"This is definitely the strangest book I've ever read, but in a good way. In this story, readers meet two couples who have babies through incest, a potential voodoo woman, three drug dealers, a heroin addict, and a few normal people scattered throughout. This novel explores how serious love can be and questions the limitations."
4,Great Book!,Read the book in 2 days. Incredible plot and characters. You will not be disappointed if you are looking for a read that you can discuss with your bookclub.
5,Highly recommended!,"This is a very well-written book about a family that was all but destroyed because of secrecy, jealously, fear, lies and pride.Ms. Files very elegantly weaves this ""forbidden"" tale of three generations, through Tennessee, Louisiana, and Michigan. It's in East Lansing, Michigan where courage is found and transitions of mindset allow truth to be revealed and this family to be free.The book is a very easy read, which I think is reflective of the story that is being told...the message if very plain: We must live in truth, or we are going to live captive to our own minds."
5,A real page turner!,Although I've read this book years ago I still find it one of the most memorable books out of the many that I have read. Great Book!
5,Good God,"This is an excellent book. To say this family is dysfunctional is an understatement. I have never read a book with such details of problems. I could hardly keep up with all the dysfunction. Go out and get this book, you will be up all night."
5,WOW!!!!,"Awesome! I've read other books by Ms. Files and I believe this is by far her best work. The way she was able to take us back and forth between time and events was amazing. After I got into the reading, I began to wonder how she would tie it all together, but she did a beautiful job. I would suggest this book to those who are open minded and not quick to judge. I really believe this is a wonderful tale of redemption and breaking the painful cycles of history."
5,Spellbound,"This book will have you in a trance. You will walk around trying to cook, clean, whatever and read the book at the same time. I passed the book along to my sister who doesn't read much, but she loved it. It is a modern day tale on an old Shakespeare novel. Don't think twice, you won't be disappointed."
4,Dramatic!,"I enjoyed this book because it was not like anything I have read or like anyone I know. Lolita Files has done a wonderful job of creating a novel that you will not want to put down. I found it sad at times because of what is happening to the characters but that is how she pulls you into the story.The book is explicit at times and even though you would personally detest the actions of the characters, it is a page turner that you will enjoy."
3,What? Why? Oh no!!!,"This style of writing is not Lolita. I didn't particularly care for this story line and I thought that she could have taken this in another direction. But, then again the actual story line was well put together. I just didn't care for it, I like her first 2 books better. Lolita is an excellent author and I figured that she doesn't want to get stuck writing one way. I just didn't care for the story line."
5,Kudos Are in Order,"Kudos to Lolita for her daring! Daring to do something different and challenging with her work, not willing to settle for the comfort of something familiar. ""Child of God,"" is a complex, compelling and often dark story, but always leaving the reader with the feeling of hope. Taking a classic such as Hamlet, and superimposing it on modern times was no easy feat. Lolita rises to the task. I hope that she continues to stretch herself, her skills as a writer and our imaginations as readers!Continued success to you Lo!"
3,No Children of God,"Where does this title come from? It has nothing to do with the story. I thought this book was going to be about Christians. But to my disappointment, it was about the devil's children. The book should have been titled, ""CHILDREN OF THE DEVIL."" Not recommended."
3,Unbelievable,This book just had too much going on. The family members were just awful. I just could not realistically see all these things happening. Brothers and sisters having babies together and thinking that they are in love with each other. This was just unreal. My bookclub read it for this month and we not pleased. I dont know if there were too many characters or was there just to much incest but I did not enjoy this book.
2,Nothing like her other books....,"I've read three of Lolita Files' other books and this one is NOTHING like them.... I didn't care for the subject matter at all. In this novel, Files' attempts to make a romance novel about incist. The story lines jumps from one horrible scene to the next... In all fairness, the book is written very well,but again the topic is disgusting."
5,Lolita Proves that Change Is Good,Let me start off by saying that this book was fantastic! CHILD of GOD is so different from Lolita's other books and I loved it! Talk about issues-the Boten family has plenty of issues and readers will be enthralled with their story. A true page turner.
3,TWEETY READ,"this book was very very goooooooood i mean this book had you wan't more very goooood read MS, Lolita Files DID A VERY GOOD JOB. CANT WAIT FOR NEXT BOOK."
5,Don't let this one pass you by,"This is Lolita Files best book yet. At the beginning I got a little confused with who was married to who and who were the mother and father of the children, but once I got that straight the book was excellent.I read this book in one day. This book contained everything, drugs, incest, betrayal, murder you name it and it was in there.This is one of the best books I have read in 2002!!...Buy it you won't be sorry."
4,not bad indeed,"I just finshed reading this book after purchasing it less than 48 hours ago. I just couldn't put it down.This book was in deed like a talk show involving one family in a twist of weird happenings and secrets that many would indeed keep to themselves. This is the first book i have ever read by Lolita files and i have to say once again ""not bad indeed."""
4,GOD'S SINFUL CHILDREN,"Incest, drama, you name it,the book covers it. Someone should have challenged that mean old Sukie long time ago. Lolita did an excellent job in telling this story. The continuous incest was just horrid. However, the way the story flowed, I could not put this book down. I was inquistive and needed to know. Maybe if the parents had informed their children that siblings shared a different kind of love, and not to experiment love or lust with each other, maybe this would have made a difference. I hollered ""Oh Lord"" so much through this book ""He"" probably told me to shut up. Grace, Ophelia, Lay, Big Daddy and Sukie held so many secrets. Innocent Grace as a child that only knew a brothers love and my my my, that's when all all the mixing of the blood began. The ending to me was not a new beginning, but I think it started all over again. My Lord!!!!!!"
5,superb,"THIS BOOK WAS SIMPLY AMAZING..I READ SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWS AND DECIDED TO GET THIS BOOK..I WAS SO, SO PLEASED THAT I DID, THIS BOOK IS ALL THAT AND THEN SOME. THE CHARACTERS WERE GREAT, THE STORY LINE WAS TERRIFIC..IT ACTUALLY SEEMED LIKE THE ONES WHO DESERVED IT, GOT WHAT THEY HAD COMING. THEN THERE WERE THE INNOCENTS WHO GOT IT ALSO, WHO DID NOT DESERVE IT..I READ THIS BOOK IN A DAY, IT IS A CONSTANT PAGE TURNER, ONE YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT DOWN.. IF YOU ARE THINKING OF GETTING THIS BOOK, PLEASE DO!!!THEN YOU WILL WANT TO PASS IT ON TO A FRIEND.LOLITA FILES, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU HAVE COOKING NEXT, THIS AUTHOR IS NOW ADDED TO MY LIST OF AUTHORS WHO I CAN BUY THE BOOK, WITHOUT EVEN READING WHAT THE STORY IS ABOUT. THAT IS JUST HOW GOOD THIS BOOK WAS."
5,Excellent Read!!!!!,"When I first started Child Of God I said to myself ""I don't like this book"" Why, did I say that...This book was excellent.Child Of God opens up Downtown TN.just like everywhere else in Child Of GOd everybody knows everybody's business. Most of the gossiping is about the Boten clan.In this Epic Family Saga, Files unveils the hidden lives of three generations of the Boten family. The family's past being rising to the surface when a mysterious fire takes the life of Of Ophelia's Infant son. the tragedy sets the family in motion all the members are are on a quest for self-discovery that will lead them to find out secrets of the family. Child Of God is just one of these books that you have to read from start to finish it is excellent. I would definitely recommend this book to others.I will be waiting for the next book. Blessings goes out to Ms.Files."
1,GRIEVIOUS,"After reading this extremely dark, & dismal tale I was numb and disturbed, and seeking a way to process what I'd just ingested. While some drama is a good thing, CHILD OF GOD was extreme in its bleak, eerie, chaotic hopelessness. Reading it was a violation of mind and soul. I'm still stunned...and not pleasantly so."
2,grim,"This book is about as much fun as an evening at the morgue. Ophelia, the heroine is the product of incest and has a baby by her own brother, the vicious Laertes. This book is a nasty gumbo of tabboo sex, voodoo and one tragedy after another. In order to pull this off you need to be a great writer. Lolita Files isn't. Her writing is businesslike and smooth but it never really rises above the okay level. Sorry."
5,"Once you start, you will not be able to stop till it ends","This is simply a must read, it is fascinating and will hold you captive from the begining till the very end.Being a Shakespare fan made it even more enjoyable for meI strongly recommend this book to all book lovers, believe me, you will not be let down."
4,very good,G00D WITH JELLY OR JUST BUTTER. GOOD CHANGE OF PACE FROM TOAST. MUCH HEALTHIER TOO. I REALLY ENJOY IT...I WILL BUY AGAIN IN THE FUTURE!!
3,The apology of Methodological Individualism,"This book examine various social change's theories. He's autor said that any formulation of a ""social law"" is a ""nomologic prejudice"": in other hands, Social Sciences don't must researching laws of changement, but must ""understanding the reasons of individual actors"". Very intresting!"
5,Awesome...,"Finally a product that does what it says. It's the first product I've found that does not make my hair crunchy. You put in on on damp hair, you dry it, curls are intact and absolutely no friz. Love it."
5,Good Product,"I use this to make my hair look more alive and I use this before I put on my hair gel because this works great with it, dont think its what its meant for but It works for me."
1,Not for my hair,I have fine hair that tangles easily and is shoulder lenth this just makes it feel like there is a lot of goo on it. It makes it tangle even easier. No good for me.
3,Nothing special...,"I purchased this item hoping to find something that would really help make the curls pop...it worked OK. The smell is pleasant and it doesn't leave the hair feeling sticky afterwards like a lot of other leave in products do. However, I didn't find anything too particularly special about this product at all and don't even get me started on the fact it's now $15.00 a bottle. For a small bottle at that! SO NOT WORTH IT! When I purchased it, it was $8.99, which is kind of ridiculous since I see a product very similar to it by Tresemme at Wal-Mart for like $3.99. I cannot believe they've almost tripled the price of this product in less than a month. I would save my money and go to Wal-Mart!"
5,Brilliant! You Gotta Get This One!!!!!,"Liquid Tales is a definitive compilation of five ofPatick Smith's films, including his latest animatedshort, Puppet. The power behind his films comes fromthe emotional charge of his unique characters. Withthe fluidity of his animations, Liquid Tales is anexcellent place to experience his classic style ofhand drawn characters that come to life, morph, andstretch in a way that only Patrick Smith could bringto us. This is a great accomplishment and if you valuebeautiful, funny and at times, dark animation, thisDVD comes highly recommended."
1,A blatant example of cultural racism.,"This book by Berenger contains the two most blatant examples of cultural racism currently in print that I have yet found. See the arrogant dismissal of Berenger of the Hungarian origins and the unbelievable dismissal of Jews in Hapsburg history most obviously in the area of the Rothchild's. I have no idea what positive value this book may have, but as an artifact of racism, it is quite impressive.Michael Wahrman"
4,Totally 80's Man,"Ok, just to make it clear, some people (ahem, some reviewers) clearly don't understand the point of the Living In Oblivion series. So far, in my listening experience, this CD has been the best one yet. With tracks of Single Hit bands and those rare songs that are just downright 80's, L.I.O. delivers a dose of the unique sounds of the eighties, and gives a splash of some of the era's greatest hits. This is what its all about.Awesome Tracks:Device - Hanging On a Heart AttackTalk Talk - It's My LifeEBN-OZN - AEIOU Sometimes YSo- Are You SureABC- Poison ArrowRock On 80's Woo Hoo!"
2,"If you valued the 80's, don't buy this compilation","You'd think that an 80's anthology of music would understand that it caters to an audience which is nostalgic toward that decade.I give this two stars only because you can't take away from the 80's music, but I figure that the inane commentary on the CD booklet should be calculated in this rating too. It was highly unnecessary and insulting to 80's fans to include disparaging remarks about the decade and banal political commentary by obvious leftist sympathizers."
4,Great History Lesson on the Modeling Business,"This book was less gossipy than I thought it would be. The first 2/3rds are great. The book serves as a wonderful primer for anyone going into the modeling industry or just interested in its origins.The book starts out with the first official models, which were generally socialites. You get to read about how modeling agencies first formed and who the first models and clients were. The book follows along as agencies and models fall out and new ones come along. Close to the chapters around the 1980s/1990s you learn more about the all out ""model wars"" and the switching of models between agencies. Mixed in with all this history are bio chapters highlighting the stories of specific models along the years.The book is very interesting and makes me miss seeing the models on the cover of magazines! The book is slightly dated now but the history provided is still accurate and informative."
2,Mostly about models from pre 70's era,"I thought this book would focus heavily on models of the 80's and 90's, but it's actually more like a history of modeling. Much of the book seemed to center on modeling/models from the 50's. These figures weren't familiar to me and I wasn't interested, so the book felt like a waste. I was kinda of shocked because the author was so ubiquitous as a go-to authority on modeling during the 90's. When TV tabloid shows needed to interview someone about models, they'd go to him."
5,Model is the most comprehensive book on modeling ever publis,"I didn't expect to learn anything from Michael Gross' book, but Ihaveto admit, it is the most comprehensive book on the modelingindustry ever published. It's so good at separating the myths fromfact that it was hard to read."
2,I wish the cassette worked....,"half way through this brand new cassette, the tape started sounding weird then awfuleven my cat made faces and her ears pinched awkwardlybut what I heard was quite interesting......when I tried to listen to the other tape #2, it did the same thingDarn!!!!"
5,Cool!,"I bought this for my neighbor when he got a new Mustang. He refuses to hang it in his car, but I think they look really cool. Nice gift for anyone who just got one of the new muscle cars.What's nice is these are a little smaller than normal, so they won't block the entire windshield."
3,Don't buy this unless you are like me.,"This title gives the impression you are getting more than you are. There is no volume 2 either so if you want the rest of season 1 after you buy this you will have to buy the entire first season release anyway. I bought this release because I had recently checked out the complete season 1 at the library and watched it so I wasn't desperate to buy the complete season release. I am a total maniac for the pilot episodes of old TV shows, and I was able to pick up this release with the pilot for practically nothing. It is a quality product as far as production goes, but a person would be better served to spend a little more and get the excellent Ironside complete first season."
2,Dirty trick by distributor!!,"Although I love this series, I was very angry after buying this volume 1 of season 1 to find out that there wasn't going to be a volume 2 of season 1. They created a complete set of season 1 instead. I will not be getting split seasons anymore unless the 2nd volume is already for sale. Otherwise, this was a great TV show and will buy more but complete seasons."
5,Good Detective Shows,I am thoroughly enjoying watching these. I saw some of them back when they were on TV but not all of them. Good clean detective shows.
4,Raymond Burr,"I give this a 4 star because my wife loves Raymond Burr, me not so much. The vehicle that Ironsides transports himself to scenes if laughable by todays standsrd.Also this series was right after the Civil Right Act and its just too heavy on making up to Black People and it just doesnt accomplish it.Buy it used from a market seller its just not worth full price."
5,Hawaiian Games for Today,"The book arrived in the condition described. The illustrations are clear and the information useful. I will use this book as a classroom resource. Overall, the purchase was a very positive experience. The seller contacted me, and clearly offers excellent customer service. I would definitely purchase from this seller again."
5,great,"I must add also that WGC's newest CD ""Mojave"" is just as good, with a couple of songs that are absolutely fantastic. I think it's an import-only thing, but well worth tracking down. Even though I'm not in Mass. any more, it makes me think of snowy days... the band (or whatever kind of unit it is) must go through many guitar strings with their vicious strumming. Powerful, powerful stuff."
5,i seen this as a young kid.,kinda like around a world travel movie. they go all over in the balloon. if you like old or just a little older movies with chases watch this. the reason why it is called 5 weeks in a balloon is most of the movie there in the balloon.
3,Five Weeks In A Balloon,The premise of the movie is to explore deepest darkest Africa and come back alive. In reality the Balloon would probably scare the crap out of the natives. I bought because of Red Buttons and Barbara eden. Ms. Eden later would be a Jinn. Red Buttons is Red Buttons.
2,"Could, and should have been much better.","This movie is best watched in a letterboxed version, as it wasfilmed in Cinemascope. -That is, if you should bother at all. Withfantasy movies it's either hit or miss, and this comedy is a miss. Most of it, anyway. Because amongst all the embarrassing and unfunny moments; like a laughing sultan, two hysterical and screaming women, a shamelessly wasted and mis-cast Henry Daniell, the obligatory cute monkey, Peter Lorre and Fabian, it actually has a weird charm of its own which makes it wachable. -But these thrown-together characters come from nowhere, and seem to have no past, so you don't care for them at all. Less slapstick and more suspense would've been most welcome, too. It just goes to show it takes more than good will to make a decent movie of a Jules Verne story. -Barbara Eden's always lovely, though; widescreen or not."
4,just what I expected,"I can buy these pins cheaper online than locally. They are high quality, as all Grex items are, and they usually come quickly."
3,Caution:,"With an eye for negative influence on children, I submit the following criticisms: ""Yurtle the Turtle"" has a secondary lesson in anarchy. ""Gertrude McFuzz"" revels in the thought of her object of envy (another bird) dead. ""The Brag"" focuses on an argument throughout. I want my children to learn respect for authority, regard for the life of their neighbor, and amicable resolution of differences, hence the mediocre rating. Please consider these and preview for yourself and your children. The positives: interesting oration, and the usual wonderfully Dr. Suess rhyme and illustration. ""Yurtle the Turtle"" allows some empathy for the downtrodden."
5,Visualizing the Life of Christ,"A.C. Wieand's ""A New Harmony of the Gospels"" is a gold mine of insights into the life of Christ. Using the Revised Standard Version (1946) the text is arranged in columns so that passages from all four gospels are easily compared.Professor Wieand's notes make this text a valuable addition to the Bible student/teacher's library. Marginal notes include references to original Greek extractions, historical happenings, and logical inferences. The text is woven into an extensive outline helpful for picturing the chronology of Jesus' life. Maps also help the reader visualize the setting.Wieand has a heart for teaching the Bible student. He understands what the scholar and teacher are desiring to understand. He even makes suggestions for how to make your sermons and lessons more appealing to the listener.I'm so fortunate to have uncovered this treasure by an outstanding Bible scholar of the 20th Century."
4,Deathmask,"I enjoyed this movie due to Farley Granger's performance, not the dead young boy supernatural thriller point of view. The picture also sports a good crime/drama aspect to it because of the basic 12-year hunt for the identity of a dead boy, unsolved murder and supernatural retribution. I agree that it was more of a mystery than a ghost story. Good plots, with intelligence, worth watching.Death Mask (1984) was based on a true criminal case that happened in Philadelphia in 1957, ""The Boy in The Box Case""."
1,DON'T BOTHER,Hi...was so psyched for this but its a dud.Needs to be stronger...this is so weak it couldn't move a balloon!(sorry)
2,You do plan to have Chain Masters on your Chain Master Tour?,"You gotta love a book called ""Master of Chains"" which deprives you of anything even remotely resembling a Master of Chains until the last 50 pages of text. Oh wait... no you don't. Lebow destroys the nice tapestries he managed to weave with decent dramatic prose by tripping through the worst action writing I've ever seen.As with most of the D&D; novels: the editor assigned to this book is completely incompetent and has no business working in professional publishing."
4,Ups and Downs,"This book has some very interesting plot points, but as stated before some of the action sequences dont add up. The zombie giant(greater than a ton) VS. man w/ chains. Not very realistic. Although it lacked some realistic action, I thought that it hooked the reader and held firm. I finished this book in 3+1/2 days. The ending is left open for a sequel, this is a plus.(also a chance for jess lebow to redeam himself)I give this book a four because again it has some very awesome twists.(new readers will love) But even for a fantasy novel it lacked physic realism.That and the way they pick up weapons and BAM! Kick a$$! Possible, but not realistic.Good read if you are new to the series. But I would not reccomend it for the die-hards. Peace out God....."
2,Meh,"I liked the idea of just a plain adventure. No world changing events. But there were just to many things that didn't make sense, and horrible ending. There were times I did really enjoy this book, but the problems really ruined it."
4,Never mind the critics,"Just read the book yourself. It seems the negatives only come from those that didn't truly read the book, they missed critical info ""two guys become master swordsmen overnight""... the two men in question were revolutionaries BEFORE this sudden ""change"".Good action, great story line, looking forward to the sequel!"
2,Not what I expected,"I dunno, maybe it's just me, but the thing doesn't seem to snug the balls up like it should. Had I known before ordering, I'd have just kept forming the diamond in my triangular rack."
5,sturdy frame,"Pitched a fit and beat it with a pool cue one evening. It's still in one piece! Well made, priced right, smooth joints and finish. Good value for the money. Keeps my buddies from having to count. When the rack is full your ready to play."
1,Confunsing 2,"I do not recommend this book at all! Don't buy this book! The first reviewer says it all. I, too, was left confused and irritated. Th character of Olivia was stupid. She was an airhead with no confidence who wouldn't listen or follow directions. You don't want her to be a wet noodle but you would like her to have some sense.This book was better than Key West, the heroine in that story really made me crazy."
2,"Sorry, Stella; not up to par",I have always really enjoyed Stella Cameron's books and so when this one came out in hardback I paid the price thinking I'd have a keeper. Not so! It goes in the trade/yard sale pile.I found the plot incoherent and the characters unrealistic. I just kept slogging through it waiting for the story to get my attention: didn't happen.
2,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT ! ! !,"I picked up this book because of the author's previous work and ended up greatly disappointed. From the first chapter I could tell the story was underdeveloped, the characters were unrealistic and the dialogue didn't make any sense. I kept reading hopping that it would pick-up but no such luck. At the end I felt . . . . . . . cheated."
4,Good read,"I really enjoyed this book. My only disappointment was, that I read the only 2 Stella Cameron book's I've read out of sequence."
2,"bad guys good, good guys bad","The bad guys in this book -- Kitty, Ryan, Fats, Rupert, Winston -- were interesting and even funny. But the good guys -- Olivia, Aiden -- were stilted, boring, and overly talky. Even the sex scenes, by both good and bad guys, were unrealistic, boring and not even erotic. And these good guys TALK SO MUCH! There's supposed to be action in a thriller. Oh, and the few action scenes there were, were also unrealistic. Just how many tries does one have to knock the gun out of someone's hand?I love a good thrillers and mysteries, but this was not one of them."
1,Stella has lost her groove,"I have read all of Stella Cameron's books and seen a downward spiral in the last few. However, she's really done it this time: chapters dealing with ""bad guys"" were unintelligible and those dealing with Aiden and Olivia were boring. Try harder, Stella!"
4,Glass Houses,"The hero in this book, Aiden Flynn, made his first appearance (along with his killer collectible cars) in ""Key West"". This book is a fast-paced and believable tale of Aiden's rescue of the heroine, chases across country by the villans, a reappearance of the hero and heroine of ""Key West"". Both Aiden and Olivia are enjoyable characters. The book is not as good as some of Ms. Cameron's earlier contemporaries, but is well worth reading. I buy very few romances in hardback -- Stella Cameron, Jayne Krentz and Linda Howard being the exception. This book is worth every penny!"
2,Not Interesting Enough,"This is my first Stella Cameron novel and it may be my last. I gave the book's first 100 pages the benefit of the doubt but then I started skipping pages, then chapters and finally decided that I didn't care what happened to the characters and skimmed to the end. The storyline of a Brittish photographer who flees to a NYPD detective for help after meeting online wasn't convincing and didn't flow. I found myself asking ""why would they do that?"" a lot. I couldn't get into the characters and found the dialogue boring."
1,not that great!,"This book does not have any new pictures of Jim Morisson. It is more like a scrap book of morisson pictures, concert posters etc.. Overall there are other better books to buy before getting this one. One I would recommend would be Jim Morrison:My Eyes Have Seen You by Jerry Prochnicky & Joe Russo. Ofcourse there are others too."
5,Images of Jim Morrison,"I am a serious fan of The Doors and, when I saw the cover photo of Jim Morrison, I knew I had to get this book---which was the first place I had ever seen it. I was not disappointed and highly recommend Images of JM for anyone who is passionate about the music and history of The Doors."
3,The Book of Books,I have not read book yet - just skimmed thru. Believe the content is what I expected. My problem is that this was listed as new book. I paid extra because I thought it was new. The book is used. It is in good condition and should have been listed as such. There were notes written in book and passages were underlined. Should not have been listed as new.
4,Nancy Drew takes on politics,"First, the other 11 reviews here are about a Sweet Valley Twins book with the same name. This book is about Nancy and Ned supporting opposing candidates for mayor of River Heights. There's many twists and turns and lots of people acting guilty. Enjoy it. It's not the best Nancy Drew book out there, but it was still good."
2,its not a bad book,Amy Sutton wants to be in the Booster cheering squad but the other girls are determined that she will fail
5,Awesome book!!,"This book is really cool. The unicorns think amy is to clumsy to be a cheerleader, not to mention to unpopular, Liz is worried that the Unicorns will hurt Amy's feelings, but Amy has her heart set on becoming a cheerleader"
2,It's a booooooooring book,"I really can't believe how Carolyn wrote a book like this. Actually,I had no intention of reviewing this book. I just decided to write a few lines about it so that I could prevent you people from reading this totally booooring book AND 'coz I would be the 1st person to review this book. I certainly don't recommend this book to any of you people out there."
3,Fractasia... odd visual journey,"I happened to find a copy of this somewhere and thought I'd review it. It's interesting for those who are into digitalized visuals. Some of the fractals are superimposed with real scenes and look rather like they were created in terragan or bryce. It's very 90's in feel and the classical music goes well with each design viewed. :) It also comes with rainbow prizm glasses that spread the picture out a bit and make it seem 3D at times but they are not necessary for viewing the movie. If you can recall the old sand / water shakeable slates that made images or you like lava lamps, this video is for you. :)"
5,Worked wonders for silent acid reflux baby,"Our son developed acid reflux when he was 2 months old. We put him on Zantac. No improvement. Mylicon drops. No improvement. Tried other formulas - we've now gone through Good Start, Enfamil AR, Similac RS, Allimentum and finally now Nutramigen which was given to me by a mother of 4 who heard about my son's acid reflux problem and immediately sent over her last two cans to me. At first he didn't like the taste, so we mixed 1/2 Similac RS with Nutramigen. He started eating and no screaming or arching his back. He reverted back to the happy, eating baby he used to be. It's been almost 4 days now and hopefully this will last. He went from eating 22 ozs a day to 34oz a day!"
1,Don't waste your money,"We bought this product because we had a colicky infant and thought it might help...it actually made things worse. We thought colick was bad, but it was nothing compared to what happened after this formula. If you have a colicky baby, stay away from this stuff and switch to soy."
1,Isn't This Just a Remake Of 2002's The Return?,"I mean, this one has the same tracks in the same order except for the absence of ""Isn't That Peculiar"" on this album which appears on the earlier album. The playing times are even exactly the same except for ""Need Love"" which is about half a minute longer here. I'd say the other album is a better deal than this album, even with a slightly shorter ""Need Love"". If you absolutely have to have the long version, just download that track from this album and go buy the other album."
3,A Project of Love...,"I had the pleasure of working with Joe and Rosetta Mines on a number of musical projects over a number of years in my early life, and I have yet to meet two more committed, loving, creative people of God. They put their heart and soul into the Voices of Rhema and the Sacramento Fellowship Choir projects. They had their own style and their own vision, and they were faithful for all the years that I've known them. This particular project came about after much toil, prayer and labor, and the Mines put their all into it. I remember each song as if it were yesterday, and I am particularly grateful for the opportunity to become a paid song writer through this project. The people we worked with were wonderful, and the tours, rehearsals, recording sessions and fellowship time are never to be forgotten. Thank you, Joe and Rosetta, for those blessed years and wonderful memories! Truly you were my musical parents in the gospel."
3,child hood memories,"This cartoon had me remembering what I was doing when first aired. I was remembering where I was living, my school and friends from then. To be young again is priceless."
3,Deus Ex Machina: The Complete Series,"I know that Batfink is really more of a satire than a true action adventure series for children but there are times when the episodes get really repetitive. Every episode the same catchphrases are repeated and Batfink's superpowers come out at just the right second. One has to wonder how he gets captured. Does he forget he can use his super powers or does he just like getting captured.If you are into nostalgia and you saw the show as a kid or, like me, saw it on Boomerang then by all means check it out. It's just too corny and predictable for the rest of the population."
2,didnt enjoy this much,"I expected something else when I bought this cartoon, and was disappointed. it didnt impress me to tell you the truth, not even my kids liked it."
4,credits not given,"the hottest track on the album is Quitame La Tanga. it is featured by Magnum but he doesnt get any credit on it. not even ""Quitate La Tanga"" Featuring Magnum. why is that?"
2,"Great look, NO durability",I love the look of these socks -- they're a little heavier and very comfortable. They're also close to disposable. One pair sported a hole after two wearings... the quality of this model just isn't good. Too bad.
3,They do an alright job,"My feet sweat and I thought these would be good and keep them dry, but they don't do such a great job. I will continue to wear them, but I think I will have to buy the foot drying powder and place that in the sock each time I wear them. This next part is an update that I wrote on April 9, 2009: the socks only lasted six months due to holes forming around my big toe. I am not a fan of Adidas socks for sure, since they only lasted six months. I wore these socks once a day every two weeks and they disappointed."
1,"Very comfortable, but wear out too quickly","I really liked how comfortable these socks were and the way they looked, but every pair of them have developed holes amazingly quickly."
1,"AWEFUL QUALITY - HOLES, HOLES and HOLES","pros: soft, cool, very comfortablecons: terrible quality. after 10 washes, more than half of them got holes."
1,Holey socks!!,Socks look good but dont hold up. After wearing one time the socks get holes on the front. No one carries these socks in san antonio and have not found anyone that has an answer. It has happened to every pair I have worn. Any help would be appreciated.
2,Shrek,Its ok i guess in some parts but it definenately not a game i like. Its short simple and not that entertaining. I beat it in a week. I know some people who like it but personaly i think it is a waste of money.
1,POOR,The game did not want to start. I had to take it in and out about 10 times before it would play.
4,pizzelle power,"My pizzelle iron was an x-mas gift... I've wanted one for 2 yrs. It's everything I expected. It's teflon coated makes clean up easy. No temp. settings- just one temp, hot. There's a knack to cooking them. You need to be ready to sit by the p. iron and move through the batter assembly line style. Well worth it and they taste far better then pre-packaged!"
5,Great for sprouting,These seeds were exactly what I needed - glad to find organic certified ones. Still working on getting the spouting right though :/
3,dolls a little small for the price,i was just a little surprized at the size of the dolls for the price i paid.they are really cute but need to be price adjusted for the size.
4,Who should read this...,I found this book funny with moderate interest. Only read this book if you are looking for some extremely light reading!
2,Compared to the first book this one is terrible,I know hundreds of people love the series and everything but I don't! I loved the first book in this series but this one just seems to have lost the majic that is in the first novel. The plot was good and there were some funny scenes in it but it was just dully written.
5,Incredible series!,"All the Enchanted Forest Chronicles are so much fun! Definitely at my top of Harry Potter fan recommendations. They're just such an amusing read; I even teach with them. Don't forget to read ""The Frying Pan of Doom."""
5,great for any age,"This is my favorite book out of the Enchanted Forest quartet. Mendanbar and Cimorene are great characters and the plot is just so, so original and funny! Patricia C. Wrede picks on all of the fairy tale and legend elements in her books and turns them into something relatively sensible. For instance, in this book, Mendanbar and Cimorene address Herman the dwarf, who used to be Rumplestiltskin. If you like fantasy at all, read this, because it is a wonderful read"
1,Picture does not match tracklist (dud),"The green cover here is for cd 1 but the tracklist is for cd 2 with the orange cover.CD 1 has the tracklist1. deeper underground (radio edit)2. deeper underground (metro mix)3. deeper undergound (instrumental)dud single, radio edit, metro mix is average with a pop/industrial sound (if there is such a genre) and the instrumental. BLEH"
4,Wonderful booster seat,"We recieved this booster seat as a gift when our daughter was around 6 months old. We were using a high chair at the time but swtiched to the booster seat that took up less space & allowed our daughter to be at the table with us. We love this booster seat. Our daughter is now 3 1/2 years old & still using it. (without the tray of course) We have a second child now & I have been looking at booster seats. I don't see our daughter outgrowing this seat anytime soon, I will have to purchase a second one for our son. Pretty cool that we've been using the first one for 3 years!"
4,Good alternative to big high chair,"We use this seat instead of a full-size high chair. I like that the chair is wood and it blends in well with our regular furniture. For home use, it is great. For the extra $10-$15, it is much more aesthetically pleasing than the plastic booster seats on the market and less expensive than the low end full-size highchairs. My only complaint is that it is next to impossible to remove the tray with one hand while holding baby. I have solved that problem by leaving the tray off the chair between feedings. I have not had any trouble cleaning the chair pad or tray as long as I wipe them down immediately after feeding."
4,Heat Wave,"Klinenberg's investigation of the conditions and outcome of the 1995 tragedy deals with issues of human interdependence and examines the importance of local and regional communities in preventing future catastrophes of this kind. Heat Wave takes a natural phenomenon and penetrates to issues of economic and social depravity, the echelon of neighborhood that one resides and the solitude that extends from those circumstances."
5,A detailed exploration from an unconventional perspective,"Heat Wave was one of the required readings for my class on medical sociology, and it is almost single-handedly responsible for sparking my interest in public health. Klinenberg takes an in-depth look at the patterns of decay underlying what seemed to be isolated and exceptional deaths, and in doing so, at the role of community and society in health.He manages to combine methodological discussion, neighborhood history, statistics, personal accounts, and sociology into a narrative of a local disaster that goes beyond the news stories and the simple assumptions that can be made about a string of hot days. It's a thought-provoking read, especially for anyone interested in public health or on the front lines of healthcare."
4,love these boys,I love both of these actors so this was very eye catching. I felt like I didnt want to look away for anything.
5,Exactly what I ordered!,The DVD was brand new!... sealed and everything. GREAT BUY. It did however take a while to finally get to me. I waited almost 2 weeks for delivery but it still was an EXCELENT BUY! GREAT STEAL =)
2,Voted Most Unrealistic Movie Ever!!!,"-Cops consistently outshooting Marines in firefights= Unrealistic-Marine firing at SWAT officer crouched behind wodoen pallet, round does not even splinter thin wood= Ridiculous-Marines running out into the open when chased instead of stopping and -ambushing-Marines putting down weapons around prisoners/hostage= never-Marines being outrun by cops= highly unlikely-Marines calling each other ""soldier""= does not happen-Marines calling Sergeant ""Sarge""= would get their teeth knocked out-Marine Corporal mouthing off to a Sergeant= See result directly above-Marines with silly hairstyles, facial hair, doing drugs= unlikelyAs a former Marine and cop, IMHO this movie has a good plot, but realism equal only to Disney's Fantasia."
1,the kill point,i bought the movie only to find only 2 disc. the first disc was 1 hour and 45 minutes and the 2nd disc was 45 minutes. the discription said 3 disc and over 300 minutes. i could not find a way to see the rest of the movie.
2,Politics and good thrillers don't mix,"I did not know much about this film when I rented it, but I am a fan of thrillers and shows like The Wire.It started off with excitement and potential, with the possibility of interesting character interactions. But when John Leguizamo's character goes in front of the TV camera, strips down (to show how vulnerable and read to die he is), then launches into a standard ""why did we go into that war?"" speech, I thought, the writers here must have thought this was a very clever way to get a little political message to Spike TV watchers. I turned it off. I'm not opposed to the idea of a group of cranky vets becoming incompetent robbers, but if you're gonna do it, don't preach to us like we've never heard of Moveon.org. We have, we have."
4,A nice initial guide to sleep medicine,"For those people who have basic medical knowledge, this book is a nice initial guide to sleep medicine. From my point of view [ MD specializing in neurology, Taiwan ], reading the book is a easy and happy experience."
4,Very nice,"The RNP is a must for small studios. I've mostly used it for vocals and acoustic instruments. Not only does it have a very pure sound, if allows for relatively low noise at high gain for the price. The only reason this did not get a 5 star rating, is the somewhat annoying pot. Every click is 6dB, which can be aggravating. Other than that, buy this preamp, you won't be disappointed."
4,good medium grade preamp,"Not a bad step up preamp for recording...its not the best, but a good medium grade pre... i use it with my fmr rnc and got some good results, it adds some color to your sound and stacks well on tracks... its a go to preamp for acoustic guitar and the DI's are decent and its pretty good with bass if the attack time is adjusted slow enough and release time slow enough...if you like real quality, buy Great River, Avalon, John Hardy and others, these are built like tanks, the fmr isnt...and that wallwart....get it if on a budget for decent recordings....my 1.5 cents worth....get it somewhere else for free shipping!!!!"
5,An exciting book for young readers just learning about God!,"""God Made"" is an awesome picture book....not only for young readers, but also to be used in reading to babies. The pictures are bright and colorful, and each page is full of life. Different races are represented throughout the entire book, with a rhyming story about everything in God's creation. Both the storyline and the illustrations are bright and creative, and will definitely capture the hearts and both children and adults!"
2,"Well, that was dull","The Nissan story certainly should be compelling and Ghosn himself is a rockstar business celebrity. How come the book was so dull and after reading it I still didn't know what Ghosn had actually done to turn around Nissan?Two things recommend this book: Ghosn's recollections of starting out at Michelin...his portrait of that privately owned corporation was much more interesting than his Nissan story; and as a companion to the Reckoning, David Halberstam's history of Detroit that focused on Ford's eclipse by none other than Nissan. To find out that Nissan was already rotting from within by the time Halberstam was finishing his great book, makes this poor one at least an interesting appendix."
3,This book is not about Nissan's new products.,"This is more of a story of how a guy from Lebanon, raised in Brazil and educated in France became a CEO. I was expecting more about how Nissan came up with the fantastic designs for the G35, the new Z and other cars. Ghosn does mention that he pulled the design team out from the control of the engineers, but that's it.This is a must read for folks thinking of running a multinational company."
1,Shallow and outdated,"I'm amazed that this book is still in print. Other than the fact that RUBYFRUIT JUNGLE was a topically-groundbreaking book, the novel deserves little literary attention. I read this book really wanting and expecting to like it, but the storyline is simplistic and the writing is amateurish at best. Skip this one and try DESERT OF THE HEART by Jane Rule."
1,Profane. Overrated.,"This book is heralded as a masterpiece of lesbian fiction. On the back, the author is compared to Mark Twain and people proclaim that it made them laugh and cry.Well, I doubt Mark Twain published anything that comments on the human condition by resorting to sentences like 'f*** this s***'. It's not even dialogue either.I didn't think the heroine was very likable at all, and had a penchant for scatalogical retribution. Everyone's creepy and sex-obsessed. She has her goals but you never see her reach them, so that's annoying.That said.. if you go into it expecting some smut, then it'll be passable. I read the whole thing in about a day, because it's not like it's Jane Austen or anything. There's a lot of man-bashing in it, and some really pathetic male lover types. Most of the chicks are screwed up too, though, so if you want dysfunction and disrobing, this is your book."
1,such a sick book,"sick is a light word to describe this book. Some things I don't wanna know. The details are NOT necessary. Definitely not a book for a light stomach. It's not just lesbians...she seems to go both ways for awhile, then gets bored with men, explores with older women, obsesses over a woman her own age who ends up getting married, and in the end, it's an altogether depressing book. Whether this is the outcome of all homosexuals, or a dramatic complaint of one woman who kept on and never gave up, i don't know. However, pick Joan of Arc or Hellen Keller if you want a real story of perseverance."
2,Not Impressed,"I'm sure this book was earth-shaking and socially significant when it was published, but.... I thought it was boring, with a very unlikable protagonist.Molly Bolt is supposed to be smart and sassy, but she comes across as cruel and condescending. The entire book is about her sexual (mis)adventures, not her accomplishments or personal growth."
3,A little bit disappointed,I have to say I was expecting something a little better from all the reviews. I gave the book 3 stars for its humor and originality but other than that I thought it was lame. I wouldn't call it a page turner by any stretch of the imagination but give it read if you want to laugh..... And it's only 250 pages.
4,'Lesbian fiction' or just good fiction about a lesbian?,"I am struck by how many of the reviewers felt they had to categorize this book as 'lesbian fiction.' OK, it is written by a lesbian and its central character is a lesbian and most of the book deals with issues related to sexual orientation. But all books have to be about something, and whether one is a lesbian or not, this book deals with the same human issues that confront everyone in growing up and makeing a place in the world. The very things that some of the reveiwers criticise - the humor and lightness of touch on some serious issues - is exactly what makes this book accessable to the reading public at large and really saves it from being simply 'lesbian fiction'. It is a truely entertaining and (for those who need it) informative book. Lesbians may, indeed, have a predisposition to like it because the themes are more immediate and personal, but all readers can relate."
5,Very down to earth and hilarious!,I loved this book! I read this book when my sexual self was beginning to open up. I love how the main character views herself. She sees nothing wrong with who she is and the way she is. She is growing up and just happens to be a lesbian and it's NO BIG DEAL to her. She doesn't morph into a caricature of her lesbian self. I loved how she considered herself NORMAL and didn't try to create a separate lesbian world to live in.
5,A Story About Human Strength and Courage,"This book is absolutely hilarious and witty! I love the main character, Molly Brown. Even though it's classified as a gay and lesbian book it doesn't focus on that, which is what I most admire about this book. It focuses more, to me, on Molly's ability and strength to do what she has to do, regardless of her financial situation and what other people think. This book is a story about having the strength, will, and courage; to do what you wish and be who you want to be, all of which Molly has little bproblem obtaining and keeping."
5,Not Just for Lesbians,"I am not a lesbian; I loved this book. It's a story of survival and struggle, the heroine just happens to be a lesbian too. The prose is simple. No doubt there were times when I would have liked Ms. Brown to delve a little more deeply about the concepts and values she is trying to explore. On the other hands prose like this leaves the reader free to think what she/he wants to without being limited by the author. This book is a classic. A lot better than much of the pseudo stuff that passes for literature these days. After all big words and boring passages do not literature or granduer make. Thank you Ms. Brown for writing Rubyfruit Jungle."
4,A like but not love,"I enjoyed this book. It is rare that I will pick up a book and read in all in less than a week, but I did it with this book. It's a fiction book that basically just tells stories about the events in a young girls life. It is not the same thing over and over again the whole book through and I liked that."
4,Definitely worth reading!,"This book was very inspiring. I had to hide it from my parents of course, which made it all the more interesting. Unfortunately, I agree that the characters are underdeveloped and the writing style is simple, but as I have never been to Southern United States perhaps that is how they talk."
1,Does anybody still consider this character a 'heroine'?,"This book is historically significant, but as modern literature we need to put this one to bed. The central character has no empathy, capacity to love or even hold a meaningful relationship with anybody, yet women keep throwing themselves at her left and right? I couldn't care less about what happens to her, and even if she does make her dreams and desires come true, there will be no one there to celebrate with her if she does. An empty, hollow book with a 'heroine' I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy."
4,This is not bubble gum.,"This book was written as if for children as all her books are. That is not to say that I do not enjoy them. I find that they hit true to home on most occasions. This book in particular I hold close to my heart for this was the book I was introduced to when I had some issues and was unsure of myself. However the book can be scary to some people as it delves into the extreme of some areas that the average person would never encounter. I think if the person reading the book is strong at heart and will, than she should enjoy it. If the reader is uncertain or worried than I feel she should approch the novel with caution as it can seem a little over the top."
3,It was alright.,"I read this novel for a women's studies course and even though I admired Molly's strength, she is the only character that you grow to have any feelings for! The language is also quite simple; you would think that the book was written for a child! However, this being my first lesbian novel book as I was coming out to myself, I recommend it to others."
3,Not Life Defining ... For a Reader,"This is a solid book, but not one that I would characterized as life-defining for me as a reader. Although I respect Brown and his coming of age, I think this is a good book while not a great one."
4,The unsinkable Molly Bolt... What an inspiration,I began reading this landmark book not knowing what to expect. Who I discovered was Molly Bolt who followed no rules and simply lived her life. She had the courage or audacity to say what would only run through my brain. I wonder where we would all be if we could simply do the same. Perhaps not the in your face shocker it was when first published this book has not lost any of it's charm. Not only do I admire the adoption story line (as I am adopted also) but also the transitions of coming out. Even though now lesbian characters are seen on almost every tv series... mis-nomers and prejudice still haunt us. I believe Rita Mae Brown wrote a timeless classic with Rubyfruit Jungle and gave lesbian literature its own hero.
3,Outdoor Toy Box,It serves its purpose. Not very attractive. Wheels aren't going to hold up very well.
1,Not a great FM transmitter design,"This unit failed on start-up. The unit design is not very good for a moving, bouncing, car. The plug does not fit very tightly in the socket. (Even with the included washer). The arm is long but the iPod Video is heavy, so it wobbles and cannot maintain consistant contact with the plug. Everything is too loose. I called the Radian tech support number. I was put on hold for over 1/2 hour and never got help. I tried 2 times.The results were the same. The package says 24/7 support. Finally, I emailed them for a RMA number (which they say to do on their web site)and after 2 weeks I never heard back from them."
5,Outstanding guide to finding birds,"Claudia Wilds has done a wonderful job of presenting lots places, including little nooks and crannies to find birds in the greater D.C. area. Directions to locations are detailed and generally accurate, with lots of helpful information.Well written, and easy to understand. A wonderful guide for exploring the world of birds."
4,"Decent statistics book, crap solutions.","This latest edition does a decent job of explaining the world of statistics. They also provide step by step instructions for TI-83 and TI-92 calculator use as well. What makes this book good is the use of ""real world"" data not some made up study to generate statistical problems. However, the solutions are very poor. Many answers in the back of the book are incorrect and the solutions manual is of little help. The Professor finaly generated her own solutions manual and handed it out to the students. My favorite part in the book is the history lessons (one pagers) about famous people in statistics. Ever wonder how Statistics and Beer are related? Turn to chapter eleven and find out."
3,Average,"This is much different than any other math book I've seen. The homework exercises are all throughout the chapters and it can be difficult to find them. Also, the information is not organized nicely with headings, so it is a difficult book to study with as it is hard to find what you are looking for. I had to buy this book for a college course, but as a stats book to own because you want to, it is probably not the best."
5,Great values at Amazon,I think Amazon is terrific when it comes to school booksThe value just can't be beat Thank you Amazon
4,Good text for AP Stats students,"I teach high school AP Statistics and use this textbook. I think the text does a great job of covering all the topics needed for the Exam and provides a good mix of thought-provoking problems and good explanations of procedures if you take the time to carefully read.As one reviewer pointed out, the problems are interspersed througout a section, not all grouped at the end of a section. This makes it awkward when trying to find a particular problem number. Also, as mentioned, the headings could have been done better to help outline the sections and chapters more easily."
2,ehhh,This book is alright. We just started using it in our statistics class. It is a very boring book and is not very well organized. I hate how the problems are not all in one section.
5,My favorite CD for the last 2 years and so unexpected!,"I loved this CD - Saw Jez Lowe live 2 yrs ago and liked his lyrics, delivery, humor. Bought the Live at the Davy Lamp CD and discovered the Bad Pennies. Just a fantastic combination. They are more than a back up bank-- and add a great deal of warmth and vibrancy.This 2 CD set became my favorite instantly. Lovely clear, crisp voices. The songs are often 20th century topics with traditional roots to the instrumentation. Many earworms...They are often running thru my head. A nice combination ballads and uptempo to the cuts on these CDs.Brought them into work and they were a hit with my co-workers. If you are a traditional folkie I'm sure you will enjoy this disc. And my non-traditional folk music friends have enjoyed it also. It's still my favorite. Only problem has been bursting out singing along full volume when the earphones are plugged in."
5,Is live best?,"Many people sure think so. As much as I love Kitty Margolis's studio recordings, there's a special magic and looseness in her live recording that really gives me a thrill. Kitty's at her exuberant best, singing beautifully and showing that she's an incredible live performer. I haven't seen or heard anyone recently who is such a real jazz performer, so steeped in the art and so free of posing and ""attitude."" Kitty just sings jazz here, and you can feel that she loves to sing it in every note she produces. An incredible talent."
1,Don't like Cheaters,"After reading seeing how everybody rated this book so high, I couldn't wait to read this book. Unfortunately, the rating was misleading because I didn't like this book at all. One of the main reason was because in the middle of the book, the hero cheats on the heroin after that I just couldn't forgive the hero for that therefore couldn't enjoy the book. I don't want to read about a cheating spouse and the hero's reason was so stupid too. What piss me off was that he excepted her to forgive him easily but yet in the end when the hero thinks heroin cheated on him towards the end of the book, he banishes her from their home; furthermore her hits the heroin for betraying/cheating him, which made me hated him even more. I also felt the ending was too rushed. I mean the conflict with that one guy (can't recall his name) was finished too fast and easily. The only reason I give this book even a one star was because I like Martin's style of writing and I think she is very talented."
5,Bold Angel is NO disappointment!,"If you're a fan of medieval romances, you'll love this book.. of course, it's no ""Knight in Shining Armor"", but the characters, dialouge, plot.. there'll all top of the line. Kat Martin shines in this book and brings her characters to life. This book paints 11th century England like NO other I have ever read, and in that aspect, I strongly recommend it."
5,Smart Easel is Really Smart !!!!!,I recently purchased the Smart Easel for our 6 year old son who loves to paint it is great !! I can easily put washable paint in the paint tray (no need for paint cups ) I just wipe out any remaining paint with an old clean rag and wipe it down clean. Excellent product was VERY easy to put together. I put it together in no time. I do recommend putting a splat mat under it if your child paints. Great product 5 stars !!!! would get another one for a friend!!!!
3,"""Portable"" NOT",It was considerably harder to take this item down than expected!!It's a great product but it's not something that I just whip out whenever my 4 year old wishes to play with it.It's either up...clogging my living room....or it's very stored in a closet until her DAD assembles it for her.
3,Okay but...,"Well my daughter is a drawing nut. So I knew she would love this and so far she does. The drawbacks are the drawing board is pretty flexable. I was excited for the dry erase board since my daughter loves those things well I pull it out of the box and it's in 2 peices. You clip the board together and there is a line, bump right down the middle. So when you draw you go over a bump. It doesn't line up without having a lip on it. If I would have seen this in the pictures and video I would not have purchased this easel. To be honest I'm quite disappointed luckily she doesn't seem to annoyed with it yet!"
2,Can't find the paper refills!!!!!,"My daughters received this for Christmas and have finished off the roll of paper. Now I cannot find the refills...they are 14 inches. It is a neat easel with lots of pockets for storage of crayons, markers and paints. Folds up really nice too. There is another downfall though, the board is 2 pieces, and they do not meet evenly when put together, so this creates an uneven drawing surface."
3,"Nice easel, but replacement paper hard to find","This is a nice easel, but it requires 15"" paper roll. I have not had any luck yet finding a 15"" roll that will fit the easel."
3,Great... BUT!,"Great easel, love the set up and perfect fun for my 5 year old. I didn't order extra paper thinking I could do that later. Now I have been spending time trying to find a replacement roll of paper. Kind of seems odd that you are prompted to order 18"" rolls as replacements below the easel picture and it seems easy and all.. BUT they do NOT fit! 14"" rolls are required. 18"" and 15"" does not fit.A bit frustrating."
4,Great lightweight portable easel,"We have had this easel for several years and it is quite durable, it's light weight and easy to store if you don't want to leave it up all the time. The ""shelf"" underneath hold most of my daughters supplies. I found that the clips to hold the paper weren't aways functional depending on the size of the paper you were using. I think making the board magnetic with magnets to hold any size paper might be a little easier."
5,Melissa and Doug Paper for Easel and Easel Review.,"The Easel is great. The sides that hold the markers come off super easy, so I am always putting them back up. I would prefer that they did this other than breaking off. My biggest concern is that this site has an option to buy Melissa and Doug Paper as a bundle. Their paper does not fit on this easel. The easel hold up to 17"" the Melissa and Doug roll is 18"". I ordered and was disappointed when it didn't fit."
4,Great Christmas Gift,My nine year old daughter really enjoys this art easel and feels like a real artist when she is using it. It is sturdy and durable and has a lot of storage for finished art. The dry erase board and roll of paper are super fun for her.
5,great art easel,"My daughter received this for Christmas last year and we have really enjoyed it. I love that you can fold it up put it back in the carrying case and pack it away. It is very easy to unfold and put back together. Only had one problem with it, there are black pieces on the top that lock the drawing board on, they have come unscrewed a few times and fallen off. I am still able to put the drawing board on and keep it in place we just have to be careful with it so they don't fall off."
3,Price is cheaper at Toys r Us,This easel is on sale at Toys r Us for 29.99 and at Target for 39.99. I would never pay the advertised price that is posted here. But I bought a better quality easel anyway.
3,Not Durable,"We bought this easel as a Christmas gift for my daughters and nieces. With 4 girls using the easel all under the age of 7, it only lasted barely a month. The price is good, and it might be good for one child, but we are now shopping for a more sturdy easel. ""Buy cheap, buy twice"" definitely applies to this product."
2,Shame on rose art,"Aside from the 14"" easle roll, (who does that?). the easle board is two peices that i had to wedge cardboard in between to get them to stay together so there is no bump in the middle of everything my son draws. The markers are weak in color its like some one wet down an old marker and is trying to get some use out of it. the easle falls over everytime you look at it. DONT try to let your kids use this outside. Lastly the tray is too small as is the side pockets to even hold a 24 pk of crayons. My question to the owner of rose art, would you buy this for your child? I didnt think so and i should have bought the mellisa and doug easle"
1,"Good idea, but poorly designed","A folding easel is a great idea, but this easel is NOT easy to fold and the likelihood it will ever fit back in the bag is very small. The worst part is the dry erase board is in 2 pieces and so my kids get frustrated when drawing because of a crack in the middle which is frustrating for dry erase creativity as well as drawing on the paper roll. It is also lacking a chalkboard which kids love. We received this as a gift and will be donating it to a local thrift store. Look for one that is easier to fold and doesn't have a crack in the middle of the drawing surface."
2,paper relacement,"Our grandkids love this easel but paper is hard to find. My husband solved the problem by running the 18"" paper through his bandsaw to make it fit the easel (which comes with 14"" paper but can use up to 17"""
5,Truely amazed!,"I wanted to find an easel for my 9 year old niece that was inexpensive and durable but not too 'kiddy'. I was truely stunned at how awesome this product was. Perfect for any young artist! I didn't expect the level of construction and qaulity that I recieved. Great gift, a pain to put together the first time but easy enough that my niece can break it down(with a little help) and put it in the convenient caring case ever since. my niece and I were very happy with it and I gotta figure out how to top it next xmas....haha."
2,DON'T BUY THIS!,"We received this as a gift for our son. After struggling with the worthless directions (all pictures that show no detail and are very poor quality) we immediately knew it was total junk. The dry erase board comes in 2 pieces, so there will be a line down every picture drawn. The backing is also extremely flimsy, as is the whole thing. My 2 1/2 year old son knocked it over within 5 minutes. I wish I had read the reviews before we took it out of the box. We had it boxed back up immediately and are taking it back today. Really, EVERY Rose Art product is just not good quality. Their markers, crayons, etc are no good. We also found out that you cannot find replacement paper on this product."
4,still brand new...,"i just purchased this item for my 10yr old daughter's christmas gift and assembled it last night. assembly was relatively painless and quick. my only observation (without use) is that it will not be as easily transported as the description suggests. many parts (ok, 4) must be dismantled in order to close the easel for storage and transport. i thought from the video that it would sort of close like a stroller, but it doesn't. i think my daughter will enjoy it though. happy holidays."
1,do not stuck with this junk!,"I bought this one more than a year ago. It is ok. But the manufacture is not following the standard - normally, the paper lenght will be 18 inch but they are 17 inch. If you buy this one, you will never be able to find paper supply. My son really loves drawing, I have tried to find paper rolls in multiple places - I could not find it anywhere even the manufacture's web site.. totally stuck.Junk !"
3,Just O.K.,"First off let me say the easel is enjoyed by my two sons, however as other buyers have mentioned there is a seam down the middle which seems an odd placement for a drawing surface. My biggest complaint is the easel paper refill, and had this not been a gift I personally would never have purchased an easel that you can only get the paper refill from ordering directly from the company. It is 14"" as opposed to the standard 18"". I refused to pay for overpriced paper so I stuck with the 18"" refill from the store and now lay the roll in the canvas bottom and pull it up the backside and over the board from there. It actually works very well. Overall having 2 kids I would prefer an easel that's 2 sided so both kids could use it at the same time."
4,A great start!,"I bought this for my youngest for Christmas and she LOVES it!! My daughter loves to paint and draw so I thought it would be perfect for her artistic needs. She has already painted several pictures and has spent most of her winter break at this easel. It was a little confusing to put together since the directions are only pictures of how it should look. But as long as it stands up to her needs, I won't regret the purchase. I would buy it again if I needed to!!"
5,Frontline Combat,"It was everything I expected, and than some. I do not have to record these movies anymore when they are run on TV. Some time I would miss the schedule. Not any more."
3,A disappointment,"I was tempted to purchase this product, in the hopes that they would be films of my taste. They weren't!I found them too 'gung-ho'! by far. Facts were virtually non-existent, save in name of the event. For a movie to be called 'D Day 6th of June', and for it to be hugely a protracted episode of a 'soap-opera' - albeit a quality 'soap opera'- is not far from misrepresentation.The other movies are more truthful in their titles, but their factual worth is low indeed. As pure dramas and as entertainment, their worth is in the minds of the individual viewers. I don't go for all the guts and glory, in movies - UNLESS it is factual history."
1,Halls of Montezuma,"I cannot review this DVD as 10 minutes into the DVD it just stopped. It didn't skip, it just stopped. Because of this, I might not trust purchaing any more DVD's from Amazon. A very disappointed customer. Richard Leland"
5,A new band with great studio recorder production.,"This band is one of the new bands, from independents labels, that make sound with the purpose to keep the progressive rock alive but put in the future sound style. The cover by Roger Dean is one of the sign of the old progressive style influence. This is a new album but the band is formed by old musicians from others old bands. The sound is based on progressive vintage keyboards and great clear guitar solos, the recorded quality is excellent and the singer is great."
5,Excellent prog!,This is enjoyable music. It always comes down to personal tastes but I don't get what is so horrible about this CD. Yes the sound may be a little too repetitive for some but who says there has to be endless variation for progressive music to be good? Most of us tend to like certain groups because they have a certain unique sound or can be grouped with other bands with a similar sound. I think there is a lot of imagination and cleverness shown here. Listen to A Winter's Tale. It's second only to Monty Python's 'Dead Parrot Sketch' in the clever use of the word fjord! Don't be afraid to invest in this CD.
2,Formulaic prog at best,"Sorry, but this recording just did not do it for me. With all the great new prog bands (spocks beard, flower kings, glass hammer, to name a few) creating great new sounds, this recording to me sounded uninspired, lacking the tight heartfelt musicianship that so defines prog. As alluded to in the liner notes, it sounds like a prog record made for the sake of making a prog record.The death knell for me was the dennis deyoung sound-alike on lead vocals, uggghhhhh... Your money would be better spent elsewhere."
2,Not the best option for bar preparation.,"I bought this book the year before I took the bar, hoping to get a leg up on bar review. Honestly, it was not money well spent. The questions in this book may have been current in the 1970's, but the format is nothing at all like the actual bar exam. The typewritten print gives it a cheap feel, and the ""practice tests"" consist of 15 questions. If you aren't springing for a Barbri course (and I highly recommend taking one) at least buy the PMBR books off of eBay. Don't waste your money on this."
3,Disappointing in comfort and performance,"I purchased these headphones after having great satisfaction with Sennheiser HD433 phones, and have been rather disappointed, especially given their price. The EH2200's lack strong bass notes that I have enjoyed in other high-quality headphones. They are light-weight and relatively adjustable as the earphones swivel, but get very hot and sweaty after just a few minutes. The EH2200s also seem made for someone with a smaller head than mine, which is really a pretty normal adult male noggin. I would not buy them again."
5,Broke within 2 months,"NOT SURE WHY THE RATING SAYS FIVE STARS... I GAVE IT ONE STARBought these suckers for use with my DVD/Home-Theater system as the family tends to get mad when I watch Terminator type flicks at 2:am. Before they broke worked the sound was just average... missed the high tones and low tones. Turn up the volume, but not so much that you wouldn't actually listen that way, and distortion occurred.Two moths after using them, and for no apparent reason, one ear piece stopped functioning. I disassembled the piece and noted that the thin wire connecting the actual speaker to the unit was broken. I soldered in another wire, and the speaker worked, as good as before, but note that was not that great to begin with. I expected more for the price.Look elsewhere or risk wasting your dough."
2,"Good sound, poor construction","These were the first ""quality"" headphones I ever purchased and I loved them for a couple months - they're light, comfortable, and the sound is a huge step up if you've been using $20 headphones.HOWEVER, the ""10-foot detachable, Kevlar-reinforced OFC cable"" was the worst idea they could have implemented in the design of these headphones. I used them at work, sitting at my desk, not moving around very much; however, after a few months the jack lost its tight fit and began to slip out. When this happens, the sound cuts out of one of the speakers. I replaced the cable with one from Radio Shack, but that one eventually came loose as well.It's a shame - these headphones sound good, but that detachable cable is a major design flaw."
5,What's everyone fussing about?,"I just got these today. Honestly, I read lots of reviews on these before I ordered them, and well, for every person who loved the 2200's, there was someone who hated them.Simply put, everyone's ears are different, everyone's expectations are different, so everyone's opinions are going to be different. Personally, I think the Senn's are great, they are comfy, and the sound is wonderful. For the average person, these are a great choice."
4,Nice present,"I've had these headphones for a few years now and they have not let me down.I take good care of these headphones so I have not had any issues with breakage. They are lightweight and comfortable to wear. Like any over the ear headphone they can make your ear a little warm after a while.I do like that they have a removable cable, as I find cables typically break before headphones.I use these for recording and listening to music."
3,Expected more,"There are two major problems and one minor problem with these headphones that keep me from recommending them.First, the quality of the sound is only mediocre. They are ""bright,"" meaning they accentuate the higher frequencies instead of presenting a neutral sound. In addition, the bass is less ""punchy"" than it should be, as another reviewer put it. (I compared them to my Yamaha YST-MS50 speakers.)Second, the design is flimsy. I owned a pair of Sony headphones that were slightly cheaper than these, yet more solidly constructed. There is a particular weakness at the point where the earcups connect to the headband.Finally, these are more comfortable than most headphones, but if you have a large head, they will squeeze inward to produce a slight ache around your ears.Only if the design was more solid and the sound was neutral could I recommend these headphones."
5,Bargain priced headphone with quality sound,"My friend had a Sennheiser headphones, and I remember it being pretty awesome; but it cost him over [$$$]. This one is half the price, and nearly as good as his. Being a college student, I need a effective headphone to block out the background noise, thanks to an annoying roommate- and it delivers. He'd be talking nonstop without me ever realizing it. The sound quality is not the best, compared to high ends like Bose, nor 100% noise cancelling- whenever the speakers are blaring, or people are getting drunk, the background noise penetrates, but not to the degree where you cannot listen to the music. You can hear the noise, but headphones kills it at least half of it. If the cord was not too long, I would give it 6 stars- go buy it."
5,A Classic!,"I'd never heard of Flash Cadillac before ""American Graffiti"". But on the strength of their performance in the movie I ordered this album through an import record shop (I still have it, although it's a bit worn these days!)The classic harmonies and neat guitars and (backing sax) on such tracks as ""Time Will Tell"" ""You Sat Right There"" ""I Wish Youd Dance"" & ""Good Times, Rock & Roll"" are almost instantly ingrained from the first listen.With the addition of bonus tracks ""Did You Boogie(With your Baby)"" and ""See My Baby Jive"". A classic album of Rock & Roll as performed in the '70's. My only question, why has it taken so long to get this onto CD?If you like it why not have a listen to the Australian band from the same era, Ol'55."
3,Not impressed with the shield,"I bought this as an extra set so I wouldn't have to constantly wash mine, especially at work. I was unaware that the shield and middle part came attached. I did not like how small the shield was and wasn't given the option of selecting a larger size. It is also harder to clean with it all attached, at least I feel like I can't clean it as well."
4,Works but not exactly what I expected,Ordered this for the wife. The current set we have has the shields separate from the part that connects the shield to the tube. In this set they're all one piece. If you have one of the breast pump bras these are a pain to put in. Otherwise medela stuff is good stuff.
4,Nice set but no good if you aren't a size 24mm.,"This set is great if you are looking for an extra set of bottles. I ordered this because I was tired of cleaning everything every single night. I thought the breastshields would be just like the ones that came with the pump; in three pieces. I was wrong, it only comes in two pieces. So if you are not a size 24mm then you CANNOT swap out the shields for the right size. I had already ordered this and the right size shields for myself. I could not tell from the listing or the picture on the box that it was not one you could swap out so I opened it. Now I can't return it. I had to order personal fit connectors in addition to everything else. I am just a little annoyed that it wasn't clearly stated and that the kit only exists in the one size. I realize the listing said to check for other listings to get other sizes but there are none that I can find. Don't make the same assumption I did."
1,Disorganized turd fest of a package deal,So this is a bunch of parts that don't all fit any one particular model...and the MicroSteam bags are not even recommended for use by the people that make them?!?Some parts don't fit the Harmony and some don't fit the FreeStyle...so that doesn't leave much.A confusing list of what can and can not be used in the bags...and Medela themselves don't even recommend using the bags...ridiculous.Totally pissed I was stupid enough to buy 10 of these junk collections.
4,big fan of Medela,Product is great for breast milk storage and medela pump in style pump. The bottles wiek great for freezing and storing. Overall good product.
1,Missing 2 essential pieces---,"My kit was missing the valves and the breast shields, which was the main reason for getting this kit. I find this completely annoying and an inconvenience."
3,Doesn't include nipples or tubing,"There is nothing wring with this set, but just be aware that it doesnt contain the tubing nor does it contain the parts you need to actually feed your baby from these bottles, not the nipples and not the rings to hold them in place. this may be obvious, but if you are an overtired new mom trying to figure things out, you just might not notice these things missing and find yourself stuck.Also note that the breast shields included are small size--not for everyone."
1,Not for well endowed individuals/connector in one piece,"The breast shields in this kit will not fit on anyone well endowed. In addition - the connectors are connected to the breast shields thus making it impossible to utilize them with other size breast shields. If the breast shields do not work for you essentially you are paying for milk holders, 2 membranes, and one sanitizer package. Very bad value."
5,Contains almost everything you need,"This kit contains almost everything you might need to replace with a breast pump, other than the tubing or pump itself. We are very satisfied with this product and am glad we found it online for cheaper than any store."
5,loved it!,"these worked great. The bags are kind of a pain in the butt to use. you can only put so many bottles/items and you can only use it 20 times , I believe. Everything was just as described. thank you!"
2,Not what I wanted,"It is really helpful to have extra bottles and pumping parts, but I didnt realize that the pump flanges are not the same two piece ones that come with a pump in style. Although they are supposed to be the same size (24mm) I feel that the fit is very different, and I found them quite uncomfortable to pump with. I do have them stashed in my drawer at work in case I needed a fresh set in a pinch, but if I had realized these were one piece and not two piece units I would not have bought them."
3,OK but isn't compatible with Medela Swing breastpump,Buyers should be aware that the breastshields are not compatible with the Medela Swing breastpump. I ordered both the same day and didn't expect they wouldn't match.Otherwise the kit seems to be ok.
3,"Good for some moms, but definitely not for everyone",This kit is fine for moms that know for sure they can use the medium size Medela breastshield and it will be a good fit. If not you should order the parts separately. A poor fitting shield will lead to soreness and poor milk output -- certainly not worth the minimal dollar savings. Also the tubes do have to be purchased as a separate item -- I cannot see Medela making a kit including the tubes. This kit can be used with a number of different Medela pumps that use different tubes. [...] has a lot of information about this. So this product is great providing these are really the Medela parts you need!
4,quite usefull,"This is a very usefull product. I pump into bottles, put dr Brown nipples on them and feed directly to the baby. I have the big steralizer at home, so I use one bag for travelling the other I keep at work, in case I decide to steralize equipment there."
1,Save your Money,"this is worthless, you get it cause you suffer a lossand think it will help, it doesnot I loss my Husbandso I know why I bought it. Save your Money"
5,JRiley,"I don't pretend to know much about Navajo culture, but have spent time on this and other reservations and been fascinated by the Navajo people and their history. Hillerman's books are wonderful reads, both because they are so well-written and because they do such a wonderful job giving a sense of the reservation and capturing the spirit of the current Navajo culture."
5,Navajo mystery,Tony Hillerman researches Navajo culture to make his mysteries realistic. Outstanding character development and believable stortlines.A fast moving mystery that I couldn't put down.o
4,Involving,A great mystery but you should start at the beginning of these books. These one quickly wraps you into the story but there are missing parts that could be explained in the earlier ones.
2,The ending came way too soon.,"I was very disappointed in Tony Hillerman with this book. It was good up until maybe chapter 30. It seemed as if he was in a rush to finish the book, leaving a very undetailed and boring ending. I do not recommend wasting your time reading this book."
5,One of the greatest bargains in pro audio,"SuperNice Mode beautifully minimizes artifacts, and like all FMR products, this works extremely nicely. Don't let the hobby-kit exterior or the low price fool you...this compressor easily outclasses compressors that cost several times as much. I'm also a huge fan of the FMR RNLA (I own one of these limiting amplifiers as well) and FMR RNP Really Nice Mic Preamps (I own two of these). I cannot possibly say enough nice things about how good these products sound or what a bargain they are. Highly recommended.And yes, they all have wall-warts. Deal with it."
3,"Good comedy, Bad sound.","I always love the comedy of these videos, but I gotta say that I was dissappointed about the sound quality. The background music was overpowering. When the characters are talking, some background music pops in at times but it over powers the dialogue. Sometimes you can't appreciate the comedy because you can't hear it. I don't know about the other volumes but I wouldn't recommend this one."
3,But there are no subtitles!,"The characters in these programs are very humorous and lovable....I watch them on TV for enjoyment, but also to improve my spanish. I wanted to get one that was subtitled, and that I could start and stop at will when I need something repeated. Though this one advertises that it is subtitled, it is not. Very disappointing."
4,Hellz yeah,I love it. The tray captures all the ash and bo spills whatsoever.I must warn you that if you have long incense sticks It wil seem a bit small. for that and that reason only I give it a four.
1,Deceptive,"This was not what I expected it to be. I thought this would be a good jewelry box for my necklaces but it was not laid out that way at all. The depth is such that there could/should be a tray in addition. Also, my box arrived with the lining from the top of the box hanging half-way off. Needless to say, the jewelry box was returned immediately, no replacement thank you."
4,"For the price, it's ok","This piece is not great, but it's pretty good. The lining inside comes loose so I'll try super-glueing it."
4,JUST O.K.,"RECIEVED IT ON TIME AND IT WAS JUST WHAT THEY SAID IT WAS.SHIPPING PRICE MADE IT A LITTLE OVERPRICED,BUT ITEM WAS O.K."
3,A little disappointing,Some silver was chipped off the top edge of the lid when it arrived. It does not appear to be the best quality. But it is very pretty and I like the interior compartments.
3,OK but no page numbers,"First, I own the large hardcopy of this book and if you can find one it is worth every penny. I purchased this small version to use for my work to avoid wear and tear on the full size copy. If you are looking for a book to thumb through to look at a variety of posters this should do but for the serious, get the large hard version."
3,CHECK SIZE,I saw this book in a book store and couldn't wait to use my amazon voucher on it. However I didn't read all the specs nor the reviews and was very disappointed when my 4x4 book turned up. 1/4 of the original size. Oh well good for bookshelf space I guess.
1,Good things don't always come in small packages,"Maybe I didn't read the fine print, but I most certainly am now. This is a mini book of what I think is a full sized one."
1,Another disappointed customer,"Buyer Beware! Before I purchased this book, I read some of the reviews that referred to the ""paperback"" version as a mini size, only 4""x 5"". Other reviews warned DON'T buy the ""paperback"" version of the book, as the images are a great deal smaller, and not near as magnificent as the ""hardcover edition"" or, the ""paperback reprint"" is tiny in size and almost useless... Search used-book sources for the original ""hardcover"". Others pointed out (this is a review of the original ""hardcover"" version, the ""paperback"" might be different)So, I thought I was ordering the hardcover FULL size. In fact, I did receive a hardcover version, and guess what? To my surprise, it is still only 4""x 5"". So, I then went back into all the reviews and I was amazed to discover that 15 out of 23 customers made the same mistake. They feel they were mislead by the publisher. They are dissatisfied with their purchase. This publisher needs to be more clear about what they are selling."
1,A fool and his money are soon parted,"I saw the full size edition of this and wanted to buy a copy to share with students in a Graphic Arts class that I teach. When the book arrived I was surprised to see that the thing was tiny- 4""x4"".The typography on the posters is particularly interesting because no technology existed at the time to manipulate poster type to take the crazy shapes and sizes seen in these wonderfully illustrated posters. The bulk of these posters were largely drawn by hand as pen and ink illustrations. We'll need to look at these posters under a magnifying glass.I'll be sure to check the physical specs for any book that I buy in the future."
5,THE ART OF ROCK : POSTERS FROM PRESLEY TO PUNK,"being something of a '60's poster collector, this book is a classic of it's kind. I've seen none other as good. Excellent reproduction plates and very inclusive."
1,be warned,"This is not the book you want to buy unless you are very small,or have a liking for using a magnifying glassit is not the original, it is a very small copy that is only about 2 inches by 3""To be returned"
3,"The book was small...about 3"" by 3""","While the book was very informative and had great pictures in, which is why I purchased it the first place I was very disappointed to see exactly how small the actual book was. I will be more careful in the future to make sure the book is normal size or close to normal size. Like I said the book was informative but diminutive in stature which is why I only gave it 3 out of 5 starts."
2,Item description should be clearer,"This little book is pretty cute, but did not know that I was getting the ""mini"" version. So, if you only paid $10 for this book - you are probably not getting the big $50 version of this book. Other than that, it is pretty cute. Not extremely useful, though."
1,Terrible phone,Nothing works. Power off itself and can't boot it back. Battery lasts a couple of hours. There is nothing I like from this phone and I regret the initial purchase decision.
1,Bad Battery life ruins decent phone,"This phone kept on just shutting itself down at random times. I was told by the Sprint rep, they have had many power problems with this phone. I'm on my 3rd battery. You have to plug it up every night to charge or it will absolutely not have any juice the nexy day. I'm strongly disappointed with this phone!!"
1,"3 different Q phones, all dysfunctional","I today was dumb enough to pick up my 3rd Q phone in three weeks. My initial phone died on the charger the night I bought it. It went into some boot mode and never returned. It even puzzled the Motorola customer service to where they gave up. I picked up another phone thinking maybe I had a dud, and it worked great for two whole weeks, until the same thing happened again. I recognized it right away and took it to the store, versus wasting time with Motorola and the same helpless end result. So today I decided to give this phone one last hope and traded in another one. As I was pulling out of the parking lot of the store, it died and will only turn on if I remove the battery and replace it for each use. This phone is a disgrace to Motorola and the phone industry. How can someone market a product so unreliable and problem full. It is a pathetic excuse to compete in the industry and anyone affiliated with producing this phone should be disgraced."
2,Not a good choice,"This may have been a good phone but the battery life is insanely short. I can't even get a full day of use with this phone-having to make sure I plug in by 3pm. The email is cumbersome and now will not send.After 8 months of use I am in the market for a new phone, I would not recommend this phone to anyone!"
2,Batary,"Ithe phone is great for its features but the batary life really SUCKS can barly get throught one work day with one charge, and thats if i really dont use that much."
2,Not what I wanted for my first Smart Phone,"I have had the Q for about 6 months. The day I brought it home I could not get it to charge, I took it back and they said it was user error. The third time I took it in they finally replaced the battery and gave me a new charger. The battery display still reads one bar when fully charged.The activ link to my laptop has been harder than getting a child to eat veggies. I tryied with the bluetooth... no luck, then the USB... no luck, took it to a friend who knows what he is doing and same thing. Still not able to get it to link.Modem Capabilities do not work either. I have downloaded all the software needed and still trying to steal a neighbors connection.I bought this phone thinking this will be great... all the options I wanted and none of them work. Yes it is great for numbers, calendar, checking e-mail on the go. But I wanted it for so much more."
2,The Battery is terrible,"The phone is pretty good - good call quality, but the battery does not stay charged for even one business day and I don't talk on it that much. If I forget to charge it overnight it is so dead that it won't even boot up if it's plugged in until it is plugged in for a while. I am very disappointed in the battery life. The guys at the Sprint store told me it is just the way it is. I don't think I even get one hour of talk time and I hardly ever use the Internet."
5,I LOVE MY Q!!!,"I got this phone online USED and it is STILL the best phone I have ever owned! The files are easy to back up, it can hold MP3s without needing them converted to some other file type. I had actually gotten a new phone when I resigned with Sprint but chose to go BACK to the Q because I loved it that much. The keys are more distinct and I have dropped it many many times - just now (its 3 years old) did I get a little crack in the screen! (even so, it hasn't changed the display any!) To sum it all up :I LOVE THIS FRICKIN PHONE!!!"
1,The worst phone I've ever owned....,"NOTE: I am not a Sprint customer but did own a Motorola Q. I couldn't find an entry for the Q under Verizon so I'm doing it here. It was that bad. This is not a commentary on Sprint's service.This is easily the worst piece of hardware I've ever used. My problems:1- closing programs- completely awkward an unintuitive. If I send a text and exit out, using the red hang up button, it takes me to the desktop but if I want to close the program I need to open another program (the task manager) and kill the program from there. It's fine for texting but when I browse the web and then text then open my contacts list, it keeps all that running in the background draining my battery.2- Erased programs- The phone locked up and I had to pull the battery out. The result? ALL of my programs and contacts were erased. Basically anything that didn't come with the phone. This happened TWICE.SAve your money and go Blackberry"
1,very poor sale,"when i recieved my phone it did not come with an instruction manual, and the battery was dead. there was no sims card for this phone and i had to go out and spend $70 dollars on a new card and battery. you can bet that i will not buy phones from this site ever again."
4,great phone,Moto Q is a good phone great features. I never had a problem with it cutting off but yes the battery life is the worse. Motorola fix that problem it may have the best phone on hand.
1,A list of problems for you,"Summary: aggravation awaits youDetails:No notes program""gwes.exe"" crashes repeatedlysometimes you can't hang uppressing the picture button often leads to no responsethe ringer can't be readily mutedthe battery runs out very quickly - a half hour phone conversation can do the phone inwhen you are writing an email, be prepared for calendar entries to repeated kick you out of what you are doing - I got kicked out 4 times while writing a single message, requiring 3 keystrokes to get back ininterrupts me every morning with a stupid ""Charge Complete"" message - thanks, but I knew that!the UI is clunky, compared to the blackberryvery unintuitive to configure, with regard to screen brightness, ring volume, etc.the call button sometimes doesn't work, requiring a power off/on reset of the device"
1,Avoid this Album,"This is a small collection of re-recordings of Charlie Rich numbers. They sound very little like the originals, and although Charlie's voice is still recognizable, the weak background music cannot compare to the original tracks. Not worth your money. D-"
4,"Was nominated for an Academy Award - Best Writing, Story and Screenplay","Here is a much lesser known 50's sci-fi with a little different twist. An atomic researchers son is kidnapped and held for a ransom of the the Father's atomic secrets.This is a tightly knit atomic sci-fi thriller with great production values and above average acting, even from the kid. The Atomic City actually has a movie feel to it unlike a lot of other 50's sci-fi of this time which which came off more like an episode of a TV show.The Atomic City was also actually nominated for an Academy Award for Best Screenplay - how many other 50's sci-fi can tout an Academy Award Nomination?Great pacing, tight direction and some superb location filming in the 'real' Atomic City of Los Alamos, New Mexico make this one worth hunting down. The collectors print in circulation is an above average transfer and makes for a great double feature with the Atomic Man!!Recommended"
5,Terrific fun,A wonderful old fashioned scary face paced science fiction film. Paramount takes such good care of their prints and this video shows it!
3,"careful with that review, Charles","The wielder of Dark moods and the foremost survivor of chanson, Aznavour is the last name to invite comparison with empowering lady's man enigma of Sinatra. This album toys with duet format with the host of ladies of varying age. Mood is same - dark, and the duos nothing more than share the platform, displaying no other sentiment or closeness. He is accurate in penning songs he can manage and covering the genres that he honors (exclude any shake, twist or folk ballad). One song is sung with S.Lama - but it could just as well've'been the present-day east-headed Jane Birkin... Refering booklet detail constitutes half the pleasure of listening. And I've been here respectful of the maestro's status."
4,Rumford review,"Thought that this cookbook was the same one that my grandmother had, however, it is not quite the same. The one recipe that I was looking for was not in the book (1,2,3,4 cake). Will have to continue searching..."
2,"twisted towers, no follow-up from customer service.","Still no word from the customer service rep that said he would submitt a claim for the twisted dvd towers that I received last month. So I got an e-mail asking me to rate this product again? okay, I'm still not happy. Hope this helps."
4,Real Pup Real Sweet,"We are huge Chihuahua fans so we checked this movie out. While the human acting was not the best, the pup was delightful. I loved this doggy better than Beverly Hills Chihuahua as there was no CGI just a cutie chihuahua acting up a storm! Plus the story was compelling, we laughed and cried. Though my 8 year old got upset at some scenes, I would say this is a great family movie for sevenish an above. Yeah Chihuahuas!"
2,"Disney, it is not","This is one of those films that is slapped together around the time a film that's a hit has been released. Done for a budget of $200k, it shows.While it's a different story that could've been sort of ok if done better, they try to ride the coat-tails of the more successful and much better Hollywood production of Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Even the previews on the DVD are for Cars Life 2 or some such garbage, clearly trying to again create a fake Disney Cars 2.The best way to describe it is a Lifetime Movie with a dog and no commercials. The dog was great, BTW. So I gave it one extra star for that."
5,Great movie for Chihuahua lovers and families,"We really enjoyed this movie. We are Chihuahua lovers so we were really excited for the release of this movie. Peanut, who plays Bella in the movie, was great! We loved watching her interact with her cast mates in the movie. It seemed like she is very well-trained! She actually was a better actress in the whole movie :-)The storyline kept our interest throughout the movie. We even cried at parts of it!I think that this is a great movie for families wit children and for other Chihuahuas like myself."
1,terrible in every way,"Bad script, acting, filming. The worst movie I have seen in a long time could not watch the whole thing."
1,One of the worst,"Maybe a good intention behind it, but certainly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Inconsistent camera shooting, poor acting, and so on."
2,We didn't even finish the movie,I rented this movie for my child. My child was bored within the first 5 minutes of it and frankly I was too.
1,Definitely NOT family-friendly!!! :(,"I normally don't negatively review movies, but I definitely felt the need to write one for this movie. I watched this movie with a 3 year old and a 6 year old, who LOVED Chihuahuas. Thankfully, the 6 year old fell asleep (It was late when we started watching it). This movie had my 3 year old terrified and to be honest, it freaked me out, too! We had to turn it off. There was witchcraft in it and the lady that put the ""spell"" on the woman made the scariest faces with her eyes. I was horrified that my 3 year old saw what she did. :( We are going to throw this away. If i could have rated it no stars, I would have. Please don't watch this with your kids."
1,NOT FUN,Just wanted to try a movie on my Kindle Fire to see if it is worth purchasing. Not sure if I'd do it again. Could not preview the film first or at least I didn't know how so it turned out to be a movie I didn't want to see at all for free or to purchase. I never finished viewing before my time was up. So I'm not sure I'll do this again!
1,"Poorly put together movie, not appropriate for children","I expected a funny story about a cute dog. However, while the protagonist is in a coma, it becomes obvious that her fiance is cheating on her. He even puts his arms around his new girlfriend while at Sondra's bedside.Very poorly done, not a good choice for anyone, especially kids."
3,Good FREE movie!,"I watched this for free with Amazon Prime. I never would have rented it or paid for it! I had HIGH doubts but I was bored on a Saturday afternoon and pressed play. I figured I'd watch the first few minutes and if I didn't like it, I'd turn it off. Well that was easier said then done! I watched the whole thing, cried a few times and felt pretty darn satisfied with my movie choice. Yes, its very low budget, yes the actors are TERRIBLE, (the dog is really well trained and so cute though!) yes its sooo predictable, but its a happy film that you can't feel bad about watching! Kids would be bored. If you like chihuahua's and some feel good moments, then watch it!"
1,stupid,not worth the time and trouble to watch. don't waste your time and trouble and bother. rent some other movie.
5,chihuahua the movie,i got my dvd of the chihuahua movie i love the movie i am going to buy some more dvds and i look foreword to buy some more dvds thonks again
1,So Bad,"Saw cute dog on cover, thought this movie might be good for my kids. Sadly, neither they nor I could sit through the first ten minutes...the movie continued to play in the background while I cleaned the house & the kids moved on to their toys. Every once in a while, I would try to pay attention to the movie just in disbelief & try to figure out what in the world it was about but couldn't get past the weirdness of the acting, etc. It was just wrong on so many levels."
1,Chihuahua: A Dog of a Movie,"After the first few scenes, I started thinking that this is a soft-core porn in disguise -- conspicuously pretty young ladies with no acting skills, studly male doctors with no acting skills, and an absolutely ridiculous plot line. This movie was so bad that it was unintentionally funny. The dog was cute and the best actor in the film, but oddly did not make the cover of the DVD. That's a different dog.Spoiler alert: The clothes do not come off, so the kids are safe."
2,Eh...,"I will say that this was a positive, family friendly movie with a good message and happy ending. However it was not very interesting, at times predictable, and suffered from some over-acting. The plot was a little far-fetched (no pun intended) but, as I said before, ended well."
1,Horrible acting!,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. At one point, I thought my eyeballs would start to bleed. The best acting was from the ""actors"" that didn't move or speak, with the exception of the dog doctor guy - he was the best (only?) actor in the movie. It didn't hold my kids' attention very well, either."
1,worst movie ever - please dont waste your money!,"I didn't want to give this movie any stars, one is the minimum.""Chihuahua, The Movie"" is horrible and depressing - I do not know how this movie was ever made - who actually thought it was a good idea, I'd be ashamed that I paid money to produce it - I am ashamed that it's in my house. Save your money for something else. Worst movie EVER!!!"
3,For Chihuahua lovers,"This is an independentlly- produced film and it shows. The human acting is pretty bad and the scenes were painfully fake.However, the Chihuahua in the film was well-trained and did a great job. This is not a movie for someone expecting ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua."" Die-hard Chi fans only."
2,Not the worst film I've ever seen,"While it's not the absolute worst film I've ever seen, it's the second worst. The acting is ridiculously horrible, the story line is scary at times and ridiculous the rest of the time. My six year old watched it fairly attentively, but I think it was just because she was tired. Save your money, buy Beverley Hills Chihuahua instead. Way better film, as in there is no comparison."
1,WOW! COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE!,"WE RENTED THIS MOVIE FROM REDBOX, THINKING IT WAS ONE OF THE REAL CHIHUAHUA MOVIES LIKE THE BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA MOVIES. IT WAS AWFUL! IT WAS A VERY LOW BUDGET MOVIE AND THE ACTORS WERE VERY BAD. THE COVER OF THE MOVIE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIE. THE STORY LINE IS SO LAME AND THERE ARE VERY RANDOM DRAWN OUT SCENES THAT NEEDED TO BE TAKEN OUT. I CANNOT BELIEVE WE EVEN WATCHED THE WHOLE MOVIE! I GUESS WE WERE HOPING IT WOULD GET BETTER IN THE END? I DON'T KNOW.YA, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE."
1,Bad from the Start,"Could any movie be as bad as this one? The acting was amateurish and the no one could sympathize with the characters. Even the dogs, who usually steal the show, did not provide much entertainment. I guess I was looking for a Bruiser from Legally Blonde kind of movie. Don't waste your money."
1,"One star, should be ZERO!","This movie is definitely awful and not a kids or family movie. My 10-year old daughter was completely freaked out by the first 10 minutes and I was freaked out at how bad the production values and acting were! It's basically got witchcraft, ""scary ladies with googly eyes,"" lots of sick kids (by the look of the preview screens - we shut it down after the first 10 minutes). Don't get this film if you have children. If you want to watch cute little dogs, buy or rent Beverly Hills Chihuahua."
3,Fun for kids and dog lovers,"This is a simple minded movie, fun for kids and dog lovers. We hear what the dog thinks and she helps people who are sick."
4,Good Feel Good Movie!,"This Movie is a Heart Pleases, Gives you a feeling of warmth and animal / human emotional interaction.Is a good movie to watch as a Family, then discuss the values it provides in how to help others through tuff times."
1,Didn't watch,this is another movie my husband picked and we started to watch it and had to leave the house. May try watching again.
2,Low Budget,I was not impressed. Story line had meaning as Animals aiding in healing folks in the hospital does work. But the rest was not developed enough.
5,A nutritionist gets a dog brain.,This movie is amazing. Dog brains. What more could you want. Mysticism and a chihuahua plus dog brains. This is the greatest stories ever told.
3,Okay movie,I bought all the chihuahua movies to watch on Christmas Day. This was the one we (my chihuahua and I ) liked least
2,"Family movie, soft porn actors?","Like other reviewers i also started thinking that this is a soft-core porn in disguise. However my twins loved it. I cringed throughout -,and the chiuauas voice is very sultry and just overall soft porn sounded. Honestly, I held the remote in anticipation of a porn scene but thankfully it didn't happen. Overall, it's just a very very low cost production."
5,Great Children's Read,"I have read this book to my children and my first grandchild. Looking for a good clean copy for another grandchild. If you have this Little Golden book on your bookshelf, enjoy it! It seems to be tough to find."
5,Military Duffle Bag,"I ordered this bag for my son who is 14 for a birthday gift, He loves it its plenty big and has straps to be able to carry it like a back pack, We've only had it for 2 months so far its holding up nicely. I hope that it holds up well.For now my son really likes the bag."
5,Well Built,"Built to last, well constructed. Not fancy or tactical looking, but then again, it doesn't need to be since it actually does the job and appears to be made to do that for a long, long time."
4,awesome bag,"The bag is awesome, lots of space right amount of pockets and is sturdy. I would recommend this bag to anyone looking to travel that needs a bag they can count on not to tear."
4,"Not bad at all, mah man.","The bag arrived in a timely fashion. As it is a tactical bag, it is somewhat smaller than the duffels that are used for laundry. But this is exactly what I was looking for, you see. It's still large enough to carry the essentials, but small enough for quick movement over rough terrain. My one nitpick is that it's horizontally standing, not vertical, but that's just me. (my own damn fault for not thoroughly checking that anyway.) All in all, good, decent bag that will last long depending on how well you take care of your things.This is The Guy wishing you happy shopping!"
3,Crime Doesn't Pay! And War is Hell,This Platinum budget disc entry features three largely forgettable 1950's morality tales and one foreign film classic.Quicksand (1950)Mickey Rooney stars as a likable mug who falls victim to circumstance and shaky morals under the influence of--what else?--a low woman.T-Bird Gang (1959)A murder victim's son helps police nab the titular gang.High School Caesar (1956)A drag race goes horribly awry and a virtually parentless high school bully learns he also has no friends.Two Women (1960)A heartbreaking tale of a mother and daughter's struggle to survive World War II in Italy. What this Sophia Loren favorite (albeit the dubbed version) is doing on this disc I'll never know.Worth a buck for sure!
2,"Very sexy, but...","...the sewing at one joined point was inferior and the garment broke after little use. And yes, it was worn by a recipient who fit into it very nicely and quite normally."
2,"Cheap construction, Interference","Ive had these for about 2 years: they pick up a lot of interference, are hard to tune, and the battery life is terrible. If this is typical of Sennheiser, I wouldn't buy anything from them again.On the plus side, when they work, they have reasonably good sound. The earpieces are comfortable for about an hour. They are light, too."
2,Cuts off with phone use,"I bought these headphones for my dad and he says that everytime the neighbour picks up the phone, his connection to the base unit is broken. He's able to listen in to their conversations because of the signaling overlap. To fix the problem, he has to get up and hit the channel change button to re-establish the connection. This happens quite frequently and he's very very annoyed. I'll be returning them ASAP."
2,mediocre for the price,"they sound good if you sit perfectly still, but that defeats the purpose of having wireless headphones. i get minor distortion anytime i sit near a device that produces RF interference- like a computer for example. its probably worth it to drop a bit more money and get a nicer pair, like the sonys or sennheiser's top model"
1,A sad attempt at writing a term paper for psych class,"If you're looking for a good bio about Sir Richard F. Burton...this isn't it. The man was an enigma of his time: explorer, linguist, anthropologist and above all, a man of courage. Yet, Brodie describes his adventures with little description, placing little emphasis on his acomplishments. By the same token too many pages are spent describing his later years in life when he spent his last years as a translater. And the entire book boils down to the author's opinion that Burton was confused about his sexual identity because he chose not to write about his sexual realtions with his wife. If that's proof, then any male who never put down a word about his relations with his wife must also be prone to deviant behavior (according to Brodie anyway). The book is a waste of time and the only reason I read it cover to cover was in the hopes it would get better. It didn't."
4,Good overview of Sir R. Burton's adventurous life,"If this man had never existed, Hollyweird could do a movie of some of his exploits and it would be considered over the top. He was fully a man both of his era and beyond it. His time in Africa alone was amazing, despite the fact that he and his fellow travelers did not find the source of the Nile river. That said, this is one of the better overall biographies of Sir Burton. The author has a good feel for the overall tone and prejuidices of the era and how Sir Burton did not fit in in polite English society. How much did I like this book, well I had read it years ago and decided I had to have a copy to keep. If true history with all its faults and wonders is something you enjoy, you need to read this book. For all that, I didn't even mention that he was an extraordinarily talented linquist as well as an author."
4,Indiana Jones in the flesh...,"Richard Burton was an enigmatic, sour, oftentimes neurotic voyeur with the intention of beating his contemporaries and traveling the globe learning and exposing the cultures he came across. Ms. Brodie also has a tie with writing other biographies of sensational men (Joseph Smith, Jr of Mormon fame) and this book is an educated insight into Richard Burton's travels, motives, and surroundings. The maps included along with photographs, illustrations, and excerpts of Burton's own words help move the narrative along. It can be 'old English' tedious, but is well worth the delve into a man that went against the grain in every way."
1,Fell apart,"My cats both love mouse toys especially those cheap catnip rattling ones you see at the grocery store. That being said, they showed little interest in these until the rest of their mice disappeared under the furniture. Then they played with these for maybe a day and I woke up to stuffing all over the house and the tails apparently were swallowed because they turned up in the litter box. These are not safe for kitties that play rough! I was very disappointed."
5,Keith Hudson--Pick A Dub,"This is one of the finest dub recordings from the height of the Jamaican dub era. Classic mid-1970's style dubs, very consistent, if a bit lo-fi. If you like dub, this recording is a must. If you don't know if you like dub, you'll find out by listening to this. If you don't like this, you don't like dub. One of my favorites to listen to on my weekly Amtrak commute. I have yet to tire of that heavy bass. Augustus Pablo's melodica solo opener of the first cut caught me right away. Keith Hudson wrote and produced the material, and sang on some of it, though of course the vocals are reduced to tiny snippets as is the standard for dub. Features the heavy rhythm section from Bob Marley's Wailers at the time--Aston Barrett on bass and Carlton Barrett on drums. One of the first dub albums to appear in Jamaica, and a big seller at the time."
4,Inspiring,This book is inspiring in that it makes you look hard at your materialistic wealth and the connundrum of possession. Could I actually do what the Autor does and pitch a tent next to the border guards and spend the night? Could I handle the lack of relative comfort I have been so used to?it made me re-evaluate my current living conditions. Chuck it all and see the world!
4,Easier than anticipated,"The book was great, and the CD easy to use. So far, I tried one sampler and my piece was great - points were sharp. However, I believe making a large queen size quilt would have it's downside because of the need for copying all the designs on paper."
5,Easy Patterns,Book was in good condition. Arrived quickly and what I needed. I have used it many times already & look forward to making many more things from it.
3,Not really what's promised,"I expected to find lots of tips and tidbits to simplify my understanding of everyday events. All written in a light and interesting way, but found the book a bit boring after a few chapters.To be honest, it is interesting, but it doesn't quite make it to what I expected"
5,excellent!,"i bought a 16mb version and a 64mb and both work flawlessly in my jamcam 3.0 and in my mp3 player! And with the money you'll save buying these vs the scandisk model, you can but an xtra card and have that much more memory! great product!"
3,Avoid Viking,"Viking as a brand was at one time my choice for flash memory, but Sandisk products have performed better over time. 64MB Flash is a joke and this was purchased a very long time ago."
1,Defective,"I bought this memory card for my MP3 player and it could not be formatted or read by it. I had to return it to the company, pay the shipping costs, and wait for them to send me another one. Supposedly these things are reliable for 5 years, I couldn't get it working for even 1 second."
3,Cute but Cheap,"These were more than I usually pay for casual flats, and I am sorry. They are VERY comfortable, and extremely cute, but they began to wear at the toes almost immediately. The material flaked and rubbed, leaving ugly gray tips on the shoes...."
5,Riviting&Minimal,"I agree with everything the previous reviewer said..except that he only gave the album 4 stars. Definately some of Tubby's most driving and minimal works. If your're ready to sit back and let the subtlety of Tubby's masterful work on the controls pull your heart and your head to the beat then buy this album! Listen to track #2 and if you don't feel how the keys just pull you along...then don't buy this album, cuz you aint feelin it...no offence to you. This album is one of my all time favorites."
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed in the little Golden Books I ordered for my granddaughter for Christmas this year. The pages and the book covers were not cut properly and the covers were a bit small, both lengthwise and widthwise. I don't think I would purchase these books again on line. It's worth the extra couple of dollars to go to a book store where you can put your hands on the books and get one that looks like it was made properly, especially when it's a gift. The quality was just not what I expected or hoped for."
5,Great book!,"I really think this a wonderful classic kids book. I highly recomend this book as a must have for all kids, good story and wonderful pictures it really helps teach little kids diffferent kinds of animals. This book was used to teach both my granddaughters wich animal is which. They learned to regonize different animals form the pictures."
5,Perfect size hoop ring,This hoop ring was in perfect condition and it's just the right size for my patio's fire pit. Thanks.
1,"Don't buy this unless it ""speaks"" to you!",Just from browsing the excerpts i can tell this book isn't for me. Anything that reads like a Trigonometry Text is better left to a person better than I.
4,an in-depth look at fauvism but reproductions lackluster,"This large and expensive 350 page book provides an in-depth look at Fauvism, however I would expect a book of this size and calibre to be complemented by equally impressive reproductions. Many of the reproductions are too small for my liking, some pages with 2 or even 3 smallish reproductions, and far too many in black and white. This book is more geared towards the art history lover as opposed to painters and those of us who take great delight in simply looking at art."
3,So-so not in great shape like they said.,"Obviously a retired library book, it was quit worn on the binding and beaten up. The pages are all in good shape but definitely was classified in better shape than it was."
2,E-mail viking,"For a list of compatible cell phones, e-mail the company and they will send you a list of compatible products. E-mail adress is listed with the info on their items.I am awaiting the arrival of my cell phone modem - will post my thoughts about its performance when I get it. They have been slow in shipping the device, usually don't have this problem with Viking"
4,Modem ok for travel/short term use,"... It was easy to set up. It is very slow, basically good for checking e-mail or sites with low graphic content. It can also hook up to a regular land based phone line. While hooked up to a regular phone line, it operates at a normal speed for a 56k modem - good for those who don't already have a modem included with their lap top. ..."
1,Not spill proof,"Contrary to the description, this product is not spill-resistant. There is no valve or other mechanism to prevent water from pouring out.You should buy the Lil Topper Sipper Cap instead, which has a silicone valve that makes it spill proof."
1,Do not bother!,"Horrible. The tops don't fit many bottles, and they are NOT leak proof. My kids drink and drop their water bottles, then come back to find them empty. Not worth what I paid for 'em."
1,terrible,These tops hardly fit anything! They were in the trash less than a week after recieving them. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
1,Different Formula ALERT!,"They have changed the formula for this product dramatically. If you compare the ingredients between the old formula and the new, there is only overlap of THREE ingredients! Buyer Beware!"
1,FIND A LOCAL DISTRIBUTOR,Please guys... I don't recommend you buying the products online from someone you do not know. Please find a Distributor near you... their are millions of them everywhere; like myself. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask. I'm a certified Herbalife Distributor.
3,"Fun, but a bit too tame for my taste","The sticker on the shrinkwrap to this cd read: ""For fans of Rick Wakeman and Keith Emerson"". While there certainly are some similarities, it's definitely not in that class ! There are some really nice synth textures that reminded me of old Tangerine Dream or even some of those more obscure Wakeman solo albums from the 70's. The overall sound texture however seemed a little on the thin side. Also, I wasn't too impressed with the compositions in general, and the playing - while competent - is certainly not a high-wire act. I have to confess that the really cool cover influenced me in purchasing this cd, but the music just didn't seem to match."
5,Perfect Nonsense!,Laura Joffe Numeroff has a flair for the ridiculous. This charming tale gives the reader a serious case of the giggles from beginning to end. The illustrations are priceless as well. You will read this one again and again!
4,This book was very well written,"""The Cat Who..."" series is about a journalist named Qwilleran & His two cats Yum-Yum & Koko. In this series, Qwilleran (beter known as Qwill) is a journalist who has inherated a fortune from his good friends, takes his cats everywhere. In this particular book, he decides to spend his summer in the wilderness in a cabin he has also inherated. Of course, his faithful companions, the Samaise pair come along too. There is one problem in this small town; the carpenters keep disappearing or dying. Is this a curse or a mass serial killer? You'll find out when Koko uncovers the mystery. I thought this book was entertaining even if it was slow at times. I would recommend this book to expecially cat lovers & murder mystery goers."
3,"Country Landcape Offers Mystery, Mirth","""The Cat Who Went Underground"" by Lilian Jackson Braun hosts a conglomeration of puzzle pieces, the seemingly tranquil backwoods scene, which eventually reveal murder when fitted together. The eccentricities of Mooseville' s fine residents are detailed in familial anecdotes, liberally seasoned with a hint of humor, generously heaped with countrified sentiment. More mirth than mystery, the usual object of 'whodunit' is replaced by the all-important concept of motive. While the murderer's identity is immediately made apparent, conditional circumstances complicate the catly conundrum. Wit, deductive reasoning, and general observation are the detective's timeless tools, be it Holmes and Watson in London, or Qwill and Koko in Mooseville. A thoroughly enjoyable read, sure to please devoted ""Cat Who"" enthusiasts charmed by setting, standard citizen's small town secrets, and the solace of solving a serial murder mystery."
1,What a disappointment!,"When Lilian Jackson Braun wrote The Cat Who Could Read Backwards years and years ago, I was immediately captivated, and the next couple of books reinforced that first love.She disappeared for a long time, but finally reemerged -- and, oh, what a disappointment.Sadly, each new Cat book is worse than the last, and it's getting to the point it's not worth the bother.Goodbye, Koko and Yum-Yum, it was great while it lasted!"
3,The Cat Who Went Underground,"Another interesting mystery with Qwilleran, the middle-aged writer for the Daily Fluxion and his Siamese cats Koko and Yum-Yum. This time Qwilleran decides to take the summer off and stay at his log cabin by the lake with his cats. Pickax is too hot and his girlfriend Polly Duncan is away for the summer... During his time there, Qwilleran engages some renovation work on the cabin. Before he becomes too involved in the renovation, Qwilleran discovers that his handy man is missing. Soon, he notices that a number of handy men in the surrounding area are also missing. Koko saves the day by digging up and solving the mystery..."
2,Did I Miss Something?,"I was anxious to read this book because I had read so many good reviews in the papers, magazines and of course Amazon. Well, I guess I didn't get it. I must have missed some deeper meaning or something. I gave it two stars instead of one only because I did finish it, so it wasn't the worst book I ever read....but with my apologies to the author, I again have to say, I didn't get it. So...maybe it is me and not the book, maybe there is way more to this book and the characters that I just didn't get....anyway, I try not to write reviews on books that I can't give at least a four too, but I was just so confused at the end of the book, wondering, what did I miss? Again my apologies to the author!"
2,Not Very Good,"I saw Vendela Vida speak along with ZZ Packer and Andrew Sean Greer, and I bought all three of these young authors' works. The others were wonderful, and this one was just not good at all. The plot was bumpy and the narrative was just plain dull. I think she was going for minimalism. But through enormous life changes, the narrator is nonplussed to the point of being infuriating. I finished the book feeling I'd wasted my time. I see that Vida's other works have been better reviewed on this site, so I might give one of them a shot. But not for a while."
1,Embarrassing,"I think that good reviews must be written based on things such as how quickly a book can be read. Maybe good is measured by how many pointless observations a narrator can make, or how shallow a character can be. It's embarrassing that such a boring, flimsy story can receive such positive reviews, but maybe the fact is simply that it's good to have friends in high places."
2,Not Really a Novel,"This book reads not as a novel but as a set of assignments written in college (I won't say in a MFA program because they are not that good). After graduation, the author evidently got the idea that ""Hey, if I add a few transition sentences, the New York Mugging piece, the Home with Family piece, and the Philippines piece could be woven together into something long enough to pass off as a book.""Alas, the weaving is not very good and none of the threads are pulled together at the end. The book just expires of its own tediousness. I am heartened to see that the passing off may have worked with her publisher but not with most of my fellow Amazon reviewers.If you want to read a great book that weaves together seemingly disparate stories and then wraps them together into a powerful ending, try McEwan's Atonement."
2,clever prose,"On the whole, depressing. Some great writing and clever lines interspersed in an ""okay"" story. I never came to care for any of the characters. And you'll certainly see why she and Mr. Dave Eggers get along - they write in the same style."
2,Disappointing.,"It is really hard to read while rolling your eyes. Vida's writing in this novel is uneven, which makes reading about the vapid grad students rather unpleasant. The best thing about this book is that it isn't very long. You can read it in a couple hours if you must."
3,Overrated,"The reviews make this sound much more absorbing. It was fine, but not stunning.While the story of Vida's character Ellis being held up by a Riverside Park assailant is not an earth-shattering one (there are clearly much worse things that can happen), I have read countless books that take a single, mundane incident and weave a fantastic tale of results, ripples, and unintended consequences. ""Atonement"" by Ian McEwan is one example. But this novel is not on that level. I wish it had been better."
2,4 Puzzle Game only,The 4 puzzles that are offered are challenging. But there is no way to upgrade the game to the 30 puzzle addition. This 4 puzzle game was originally a free giveaway from Comp USA but is no longer supported by them for upgrading.Jewels of the Oracle
4,Good Gaelic Resource for Children and new Gaelic Learners,"I reviewed this book in my Gaelic Study group and thought it was excellent. Very basic and easy to grasp. I just got home and couldnt get on line fast enough to put in my order! The illustrations are clear and the pronunciation guide was excellent. Even though it's a children's book and my children will certainly benefit, I plan to use it myself since I have just joined the study group and need to grasp basic names and words."
4,Pretty interesting book,This book is a good one to learn how big companies apply marketing overseas.
2,A collection of TV show episodes,"Reading over the package, you would think you are getting a new movie. Instead, you are really getting three episodes of the TV show stuck together and called a movie. The only difference between this ""movie"" and the other videos of the Saddle Club is that this one eliminates the opening and closing song every time a new episode begins. The stories don't link together as the back of the movie box suggests, instead one story will just end and another line will begin. It's fun to watch Stevie, Carole and Lisa's outfits though- they dress all in either blue, pink, purple or green. John Brightstar comes out to Pine Hollow (which never happened in the book) and isn't even from the west- it's all an act. You'll also recognize the story he tells about Belle as the story that was told when Kate wanted the stallion and ended up with Moonglow. And one more thing- no where did it ever say that Skye's real name was Bruce. My advice- stick to the books!"
2,DO NOT BUY IN BRITAIN,"Not compatible with our dvd machines. My daughter very upset , i know i should of checked before i bought it ."
1,Horrible,"Worst horse movie ever. Its cheesey and totally not at all like the books. Also, Saddle club gave me a totally bad view of horses. Horses dont neigh that much, and a domestic horse never really rears. What about bolting or bucking? Wont even mention the first time at a barn. Overall, i hated the movie."
3,loved this as a kid,"glad the movies still are out so my girls can watch them..like i did as a younger girl. the movie was here fast or on time, nicely packaged. played well. thank you"
2,Wishful thinking,"Many years ago, I was a member of MCC and personally met Troy Perry. At that time (1972-73) I admired him, although I was a bit put off when I tried to discuss the Bible with a MCC deaconess, only to hear her say (quote) Gee, I don't think the Bible mentions homosexuality. (unquote) It is this sort of ignorance and wishful thinking that attracts people to MCC. It is ironic but not surprising that Perry's own tastes have been unwittingly denounced by the MCC members."
2,Even allowing for Christian charity...,"Even allowing for Christian charity this is a poor effort. It has no literary flair at all but instead reads like it was dictated and typed up with little if no editing.I don't get The Reverend Perry's take on Christianity at all - and I dearly wanted to. As a former member of the Born-Again Brigade and gay myself, I had hoped for some insight. Alas, he just comes across as someone with a lack of self awareness and his grasp of theology strikes me as naive at best. I wish I could be more generous but I can't.If you're looking for a book with insight and integrity on this theme then I'd suggest Mel White's ""Stranger At The Gate"". Otherwise your dollars would be better donated to charity than to buying this waffle."
5,We know alot more about heaven than we think,"The author does a super job of pulling together information from places like the Bible, thoughts of many great thinkers, and the words of Jesus, and building logical answers to questions many of us have about heaven. The author shows we know alot more about it than we think.The author also does a good job of bringing the information together in a logical manner and inspiring new thought about our relationship with God.I really enjoyed the book, (in case you couldn't tell...)"
1,Very disappointed,"I wish I had read the negative reviews more closely before buying this book. I was looking for a biblically-based book on Heaven. Unfortunately, I let the author's scholarly verbage persuade me to think his ideas would be based on more than his opinions. He even goes so far as to say that ""happy ghosts"" are from heaven... *because* who would venture to claim that C.S. Lewis' visitation (of his dead wife) was demonic?! This is the same weak reasoning he uses throughout the book. I find more biblical facts in Francine Rivers' historical fiction. There is nothing wrong with stating opinions but the author passes his off as facts."
1,Disappointed,"Would strongly suggest ""A Travel Guide to Heaven"" by Anthony Destefano. Much better, easier to read for the average reader."
1,The Gospel According to Kreeft,"The author tries to accommodate a wide audience in his attempt to describe heaven and its requirements for admission. Rather than relate the beliefs of various religions, the author selects the sources that support his New Age view. While the Bible serves as one of his sources, he doesn't give it any special authority. In considering some of the teachings on Heaven by Jesus Christ, the author sides with the views of non-Biblical writers in order to justify his position on a particular point. For readers interested in a scripture-based approach to Heaven, Billy Graham's ""Death and the Life After"" is a much better alternative."
1,based on opinion,This book was very disappointing. It was all based on opinion. The author makes things up about how ghosts come from unsettled souls in purgatory. There is no such thing as purgatory. Purgatory was a place made up by the early church to collect money.
3,Petmat Litter Pan,"Product is as advertised, nothing special, but doesn't need to be considering its purpose."
5,Petmate Jumbo Litter Pan,Just exactly what I was looking for and very fairly priced. I ordered 12 for my cat rescue. I could not find them locally.I will definately order more as needed.
2,Shipping too high!,"Not sure if this is kosher, but the dealer might be interested.This pan looks to be exactly what I want, so I just put 3 in my cart. But when I saw that shipping was nearly as much as the total for the pans, I canceled. $15 for shipping? Although the pans would require a pretty large box, they're light weight and can be stacked one inside another. No way the postage would cost anything like the shipping charge, so it's mostly ""handling."" Expensive handling if you ask me."
3,??,I'm looking for the largest pan I can find... does the manufacturer want me to guess the dimensions here? Come on now...
4,A good astral book by a good author,"The author gave suggest not to smoke and drink coffee before our first astral trael. Then, there was mind travel exercise before start an astral tavel. In this book, you'll find 11 techniques : First astral travel, meditation method, swing mehod, the french method, the whirlwind method, the visualization technique, will power method, chakra method, affirmation method, the christos method and hypnotism method. So, you can find which technique work best for you. Of course you can teach to another person, so both of you can go travel together. Just like anothers Webster's book, it's easy to follow"
3,Too much History,This book mentions too many historical events to support its viewpoints. A lot of pages are filled with facts that support the possibility of astral travel instead of getting straight to the point. I give this book 3 stars because it does work and is filled with a lot of historical rubbish that is totally unnesesary.
5,its a good book !!!!!!,it has several exercises to make astral voyagers easythe author uses very simple language to make the book understablein conclusion is very good book to start.
2,okay book,"it was alright, but i prefered flying without a broom by dj conway more, though i enjoyed the numerology section of the book."
1,Fooled by a different cover!,"I was very disappointed in this book simply because of the fact that ithad a DIFFERENT cover then the book that I already own! Yes, I realizeI should pay attention to the books that I buy on-line, yet I never thoughtthat this book would be the same as one that I already have.I was startled when I received this book! ....and disgusted."
3,A tale of a girl growing in a small town in India,"This is a tale of a young girl in a Bengali family who is looking for love . Unfortunately she falls in love with a married Uncle & the results are traumatic. The language is superb, The plot interesting. Read the book to find out more."
4,A run for your money,"This CD player is something worth all of the money you will pay for it, so I would definitely buy this. The only reason why I give it 4 stars and not 5 stars is because it does not have an AM/FM tuner. I once owned this CD player before I gave it to my friend when I got a new one with a tuner and it is well worth every cent down to the penny.P.S. Any one who'd give this product 1 or 2 stars is definitely under-rating it"
1,BAD SOUND!,"I had this cd player for less than a year and the headphones went bad way before i wrote this. then, the cd player if you play cds on it with a lot of drumming in it. i thought it ws just the othe headphones i was using bt it wasnt it was the cd player. this cd player is [worthless]!!! i suggest getting a philips cd player those are the best ones"
2,Yuck - don't waste your money,"A friend recomended this DVD to me, so I bought the DVD. Don't be fooled - this movie sucks. I admit that I liked the title song (Behind Blue Eyes), originally done by the Who, as well as the video of the song. But the movie itself was a poor imitation of The Sixth Sense and, especially, Stir of Echoes. The plot is somewhat preposterous, even for a horror film.Halle Berry looks good in the film, and she didn't do a bad job acting. In fact, all the actors and actresses Gothika tried their best to do a good job and are fairly credible. But the script is lame and the premise is foolish. Overall, the movie is pretty tired. This movie adds nothing to the genre."
4,Gothika Behind The Scenes,Lets cut to the chase this is an awesome well made movie. I for one loved it. It was intresting fun thrilling entertaning and a little spooky. Its about a girl named rachel parsons and she keeps taking over peoples bodys and making them kill people but the only reason she does that is beacause that person killed her. So she takes over Miranda (Halle Berry) and makes her kill her husband because her husband killed rachel and then she gos to a phsyco home with her patient Cloe only to discover rachel takes over cloe and tries to make her kill the other guy that killed her.It was ratet R but should have been PG-13Acting---- *****Filming--- ****script---- ***storyline---*****movie----*****Overall---****I hope you take my advice and see it because i liked the movie and i hope you will like it too.

4,gothika,this is a fun movie and I loved Halle Berry in her role. There are some scary parts and I liked the story. See the movie and get the Special edition. I made the mistake of buying the single disc and not the 2 disc. I love Gothika!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Great Movie,This is an exciting movie. I enjoy watching it. How crazy it is to be married to a man thinking he is a great person. But he has a secret life. A horrable secret life. Makes me question my husband life with out me around....lol.
3,Great Whodunit That Falls Apart Towards The End,"I won't go into the plot of this film, so I'll just talk about the good points and the bad. Great suspense thriller, which has a good buildup. The atmosphere is great as well, I guess done in a gothic style, hence the name of the film.Sadly, the film falls apart at the end. There's no clarification on why Halle Barry's character did what she did. And how could all that stuff be going on at the end without anyone hearing? And of course, someone (I won't say who), shows up right after, which goes nowhere. And the ultimate ending - 'I see dead people'. What was this? An attempt to plant the seed for a sequel? It was really dumb.So, while the film delivers on chills and suspense, it ultimately falls flat at the end, suffering from the problem of cliches and a lame wrap up."
2,Berry does as well as anybody else could in this muddle,"GOTHIKA follows standard horror-thriller conventions (especially the red herrings and cheap scares) and it's technically well-made. But . . . the anticlimactic third act finishes with a ridiculous finale with muddled disclosures and plot holes galore. GOTHIKA wants to be a supernatural ghost story, a woman-in-prison movie, a wrongfully accused movie, a murder mystery, and unintentionally, a comedy! Not awful, but not that good either."
2,ENOUGH ALREADY,"Okay, no more movies with stupid dead kids that communicate to the living. No more stupid thrillers that have these bad endings (i.e. Identity). No more remaking classic rock songs (the who's ""Behind Blue Eyes"") for the soundtrack by no talent hacks by pseudo bands like 'limp bizkit'. The movie looked alright, had the normally unwatchable bad actress Penelope Cruz, prepostorous story and Halle Berry. SKIP IT."
1,turning the matrix into a cliche` vanity filled horror,"dark castles has had a bad past for putting out horror movies with over made computer graphic creatures, shakey plots, and good-looking woman with cues to scream, and show skin, disbelieving in the actuall acting talents they're suppose to give. Instead they go to the cgi graphics. dressing the movie up. In the opening credits I saw joel silver...mixing the producer of the matrix movies, and dark castles which helped put out movies like house an haunted hill, the haunted, and 13 ghosts -- it's the oil and water mix at it's worst. The elements are very watered down and over done!! if you like computer generated horror movies that make up more than 40% of the movie you might like it, but if you're a classic horror lover you might not like it."
4,Not as scarey as I thought,"I was in the mood for a good, suspenseful, scarey movie. So I rented 'Gothika,' since I heard that it was very, very scarey.NOTE: If you're looking for a thrill ride/ultimate scare, pass this one up.Halle Berry does an excellent job portraying Dr. Miranda Grey, who works in a mental institution. She has trouble believing the outlandish tales that the inmates tell her, until she becomes one herself.'Gothika' employs the use of paranormal, with ghosts and possessions taking the majority of the explanations, and the film.However, there are some rather suspenseful, and awe-inspiring parts of the film, like Berry's multiple attempts at escape, and also parts in which the ghost visits her cell. Toward the end, the film becomes somewhat predictable, but nevertheless, suspenseful. And it does all make sense in the end!Overall, I believe that 'Gothika' is worth four stars."
2,Staggeringly drab script that does not connect-the-dots,"This script certainly could use an ambulance! This movie reminded me of ""Abandoned"" with its meandering script. The whole gist of the script relied on a chance encounter with a dead girl's ghost in the middle of a country road and an ensuing possession of Halle Berry's body. How much further off the beaten track can you get? That sequence of events had NO RELATIONSHIP to what had happened in the film thus far. It was like ""black fly in your chardonnay"", to borrow from Alanis Morrisette. So obtuse and obtrusive, it made the rest of the film dismal to watch. Plus the ending had offensive twists and turns that were unbelievable and disconnected. I think the best description of this script and direction is Head Cheese.The only reason it gets even TWO STARS is for Berry's performance. She took a shoddy script and made it work the best she could."
3,Just like everything else . . . .,"Gothika was a fairly good movie . . . however,I don't believe that any new territory was charted. The spookiness of the movie was much like ""Sixth Sense"" while other parts reminded me of 8MM, What Lies Beneath, and CSI episodes. Berry plays her character well, but Cruz steals the show. She is compellingly creepy, and I wish that the plot could have involved her more. Overall, this is a decent movie to rent, but too un-original to actually purchase."
4,A surprisingly good and scary movie,"Halle berry stars in this good horror movie in which Halle Berry plays a doctor (psychiatrist) at a mental institution but her life still seems to be fine. She has a nice husband and life is great until she wrecks her car to avoid hitting a naked lady in the street. When she wakes up, she's in the mental institution for murdering her husband which she doesn't remember doing. But, believe me, there's more to it and obviously something else is happening behind this. I won't say anything else because I don't want to give away what else happens or the highly unpredictable ending that no one will guess. Halle Berry gorgeous and she also can act as she does actually a very nice job. Horror movies like this are hard to find lately. Watch it and be surprised at how good it is and what a surprising ending you'll be in for."
2,"Good acting, flawed storyline","Most movies ask for a certain level of suspension of disbelief, but this one carries this to a ridiculous extreme. For example, if a ghost can carve a clue into your arm, why can't it just write you a note to tell you what it wants? Also, I'm quite certain that a medical examination after a rape is a good way for a well trained expert to determine whether or not a woman has been raped or at the very least has had sexual intercourse. Another problem in the movie is with the fact that in a suicide investigation, the forensic examination of the body would determine whether or not injuries were received before or after death. These and other obvious flaws in the storyline and the less than mediocre plot are just some of many reasons this movie is lacking and should be skipped."
3,Not too shabby,"The film was actually not too shabby. The sets and cinematography get a full five stars. Effects are also nicely done, not overly complex, but well suited to their place in the film.Plot and acting are also not bad at all.. the film actually has some surprises in store, and its all brought off rather effectively.The music is perfectaly adequate to the film, though it isn't particularly imaginative. The one big misstep is tacking on that farmer's lament of a song at the end - how exactly does that fit in with anything? Time to grow up people...In conclusion a film well worth watching, especially if you are a fan of the genre. Probably won't hold up well to repeated viewing, since once the shock value is gone, what else is left?The title seemed a bit of an odd choice as well - there must have been quite a few disappointed goths out there! Oh well."
2,Not exactly a horror movie...,"This movie in my opinion falls more under the suspense genre rather than horror. The movie isn't really all that scary, the scenes where something ""scary"" happens are very predictable. Halle Berry was mediocre as was the rest of her supporting cast.All in all, the first half of the movie is enjoyable but the climax/ ending will leave you speechless (not in a good way). It leaves you thinking ""wow, it turned from a ok movie to an outrageously dumb freak show."""
2,"A bleak, evaporating movie","The first half of this movie builds with an interesting story concept and some beautiful and inventive cinematography. Then it simply runs away into a film so full of plot holes and forgotten story threads that it sort of dissolves into nothing.By the end of the film, all the characters have lost any depth that was hinted at in the promising beginning. Robert Downey gets one decent scene, and then is left to wander through the rest of the picture, delivering a line here or there and generally looking either bewildered or dutifully concerned. Halle Berry, who has proven that she can act well in a supporting role, can't really seem to deliver the weight needed to carry a picture.All in all, a good start that quickly digressed into a weak mishmash of ideas and concepts. All the viewer is left with in the end is the rainy, bleak atmosphere of the picture - slick and pointless. --Mykal Banta"
3,You can do worse during an evening at home.,"Stylish direction and very good acting (especially by Halle Berry and Robert Downey, Jr.) are somewhat done in by an often obvious script. If plot points and clues were presented with anywhere near the subtlety seen in the directing or acting, this movie really could have been something. Instead, the film ends up being fairly entertaining yet predictable. I don't know if this is the fault of the script writers or the director, the latter of whom probably had the power to better hide the clues or alter the dialogue and exposition during shooting to avoid letting the various cats out of the bag too soon. Still, this isn't a horrid film, and I don't hesitate to recommend it as a rental or an inexpensive purchase. Picture and sound on the DVD are generally excellent, and there are a few interesting extra features. Overall, this isn't a bad little film to discover on DVD."
3,"Good ""Goth""","Halle Berry stars in an average thriller that might have faired better as an episode from ""Tales From The Darkside"", than a stand alone film.Berry stars as a psychatrist who becomes a patient in her own institution after she is accused of killing her husband, an act she can't recall. Things change to the bizarre when she actually starts to have nightmares of the event, and paranormal occurences start to take its toll on her mind. The questions is: Did she lose her mind & really kill her husband or is it something different entirely?The film does have some impressive twists and turns. But, once the pieces come together, you can figure out what's going on and the last quarter of the film is a by the numbers conclusion with and above average ending that might lead to a sequel. A good movie, but, not as scary as it is intended to be. The DVD has very little special features (a trailer, a below average music video, and film commentary). Rental only."
3,A Monkey Could Have Written This Script,"I was so excited to see this movie when it first came out. But to my surprise, I was getting hyped up over nothing. I don't completely believe that I wasted a full hour and a half of my life because I learned how a horrible script couldn't even be saved by the best actors.I must say, Gothika had it moments, but as everyone else has said, it's like stir of echos. At times in this film, the script didn't really make sence - there were many holes. A coincidence is pretty far fetched in a film, but to have 20 coincidences happen one after the other makes a movie simply boring and unbelievable.If they make a Gothika 2, I will most definately not bother even renting it."
4,"Derivative, but Very Well Done","If you've seen either ""The Changeling"" or ""Stir of Echoes"", then you know the plot of this thiller. But that shouldn't deter you from seeing it. It is an extremely well done horror/thriller concerning Halle Berry as a psychologist who is accused of killing her husband (Charles Dutton, believe it or not). She doesn't remember the murder. Is she crazy, a cold blooded killer, or is someone framing her???Berry is superb in this difficult role, as is the rest of the cast. Very dark, moody direction and some excellent effects make this Dark Castle production their best. Dark Castle specializes in William Castle remakes and horror. Their next is a remake of ""House of Wax"". Silver and Zemekis hold the golden age of horror near and dear, so we'll be seeing more tribute films as the years go by."
3,So-So script saved by good production,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW***Halle was very good in this film. When she was first informed of her husband's death, her reaction was stunningly good acting. She did well considering this plot was full of unexplained holes. For example, if the ghost wanted her help, why did it keep attacking her? Even if she was possessed when she killed her husband, she STILL killed him, even if her husband was a killer himself, how did she get out of that one?Mediocre script was saved by good photography and a wonderfully gothic institutional jail. The building looked old and gothic yet futuristic at the same time. The stop-go fast forward /motion movements of the ghost is really a lame effect and getting tiresome.. the film is saved by Halle's acting and cool settings..."
4,A Haunting She Will Come,"This film is way cool! I really would have liked a sequel to it but I guess it wasn't in the cards. Miranda is a doctor, as her husband, who works in a hospital for the criminally insane. Everything in her life is wonderful... Until she is committed for murdering her husband and now must unravel the ghosts reasons for her crime! Now the film has loop holes, sure. That's why I did not give it a five. But for the most it is a wonderful film and great way to lose yourself for a time."
3,It's ok.,"The movie part was good, but the sound quality could have been better. I had to wear headphones in my ears so I could hear the movie, and I had the volume turned up as well."
4,"Good movie, but do NOT buy this version!","I realize that this isn't really a review of the movie per se, but I just had to warn potential buyers to wait until October 12 when a 2-disc Special Edition will be released. Do NOT buy this single disc edition! It has crappy bonus features, whereas the upcoming 2-disc version will surely have tons of great bonus material that will put this version to shame. I almost made the mistake of ordering this version. And to add the icing on the cake, the 2-disc edition will cost *LESS* than this edition.And oh yeah, the movie itself is very cool. Dark, atmospheric and well acted, especially by Halle Berry (she's always great anyhow)."
2,"So, so","This was a different type of role from Berry's other films. Maybe she's attempting everything to keep from being typecasted. Well, I liked the movie for what it was worth...passing time on a rainy day. This movie held my interest but I guess the bad guy too soon and I was right. Just remember when something is too obvious, it's not real or it's not the bad buy. Rent this, please don't buy it."
3,reminds me of another movie,"Yep this is a bit like Fallen from five years ago. Fallen tried to do something and failed. Gothika tried the same thing and it worked. Halle Barry is the only person possessed throughout the whole movie and it has a psychological effect on her, and, throughout the course of the movie, the viewer is able to see the progression of her as a psychologist moving into the role of a being a mental patient. With Fallen, the possession of the soul moved too quickly and there were too many people that were possessed."
3,Some good effects,"Similar to a Stephen King effort, this rather overrated film concerns a prison psychiatrist who has been accused falsely of murdering her husband. It is partly a ghost story as well but over all the dramatic tension is not played out as well as some other films, and I think there are many better films out there. But as a horror story it's fairly good, since it effectively combines a ghost story with a story of another murder. The best scenes show Halle Berry as the psychiatrist thrashing herself about her cell after she has been thrown in an asylum along with her former patient; she knows she is innocent of the crime of which she has been accused, so this is not the act of a madwoman.The scenes showing her trying to escape the asylum go on and on and grow tedious after a while."
3,Gothika--pretty good until the train wreck,"Gothika was a decent movie until the end--an absolute train wreck. What happened?? What were they thinking?Otherwise, the movie had chills and thrills and kept me on the edge of my seat. I don't know if Castle would have been proud, but overall, it wasn't too shabby. It was much better than last springs disappointing ""Identity."" The only REALLY annoying thing in the movie (other than the ending) was Halle Berry's screaming. She really got on my nerves with that constant shrilling scream. And another thing, why put a bunch of scary music around everything that occurs in a movie? This seems to be a new annoying Hollywood habit. If someone is just going to the bathroom, we don't need the DA NUH DA NUH DA NUH--for goodness sakes, don't be sooo cheap!Go see Gothika. It's worth the price of admission."
1,Horrible,The story has a great concept i'll admit but the acting and such are just bad. why amazon recommended this to me i don't know.
5,Killing two birds with one DVD...,"I bought this DVD for Queen of the Damned (awesome vampire movie!), but Gothika was an added bonus. What could go wrong when you settle in with some popcorn watching the great Robert Downey Jr.? He makes any average movie so much better. Did I mention the price of this set? Who needs BlueRay anyway? Thanks Amazon!"
5,I love this movie in so many ways,"Gothika is not scary at all it's mostly base on events that pushes it self to the anwser. The movie is very dark and blue and takes place in a mental hospital ,Halle berry plays a doctor that helps mental patents like penelope cruz who does great in this movie by away.When Halle goes home she see's a girl on the road When she tries to help her she all of a sudden wakes up in the mental hospital as a patent the rest of the movie is really good and a big must see."
3,"Great Cinematography, trite uncreative dialog","Great Cinematography, trite uncreative dialog......I was not blown away by the ending.....I figured it out.Very ""the Ring""-ish"
2,Terrible!,This is a terrible horror movie in which characters must behave like idiots in order for the plot to work. How could Berry waste her new Oscar winner status in this crap?
2,MELODRAMATICA,"Somewhere in this gloomy picture they're may be a decent women's prison exploitation flick. But as a horror film, the movie seems unable to settle into a niche of the gender before abandoning it and exploring another. At once, film noir, simple detective, horrific, ""Gothika"" changes hands like a deck of flip cards out of chronological order, finally settling on a bizarre plea of social conscience. Before then the movie is often just flip. When a local newspaper's banner front page headline reads, ""Local Girl Commits Suicide"", the fine line between black and white isn't grey, but completely colorless."
2,A CONFUSED MESS THAT'S ALL OVER YET NOWHERE,"A seemingly ordinary psychiatrist finds herself locked up in her own mental institution for a murder she can't remember, and with a ghost that won't leave her alone. The background music creeps and skulks and spasms, as the camera undulates, but the content is scattershot and laughably melodramatic. Add to that a doozy screenplay that skips between the natural and supernatural with such wild abandon that you never quite know where you are. If the director had been less interested in getting Berry out of her baggy hospital costumes, perhaps we could have savored a thriller with some coherence."
2,Don't believe the hype.,"hype is fine, i like a good bit of excitiment about going to see a movie, but gothika started with your typical cello/heartbeat/asmatic wheezing, and never really recovers from that terrible cliched start.a good movie, by present horror-flick standards, but not the deeply chilling or intelligent flim i was led to believe.also, i have a grudge against 'mad people' sterotypes, of which this flim abuses excessively.the style borrows from nakata (director of the origdional ring and dark water), but without his subtle atmospheric flare.rent if you have to, but don't buy."
5,Surprisingly very good--and scary!,"Don't watch this movie at night, and when you are alone! I did and I almost turned it off. Almost, but it was so good, entertaining, & suspenseful I kept it on. Halle Berry is also surprisingly very good in this. Her acting isn't fakey or like she knows a camera is on her. I very much reccomend this movie if you are looking for a suspenseful spook."
4,a sci fi who donit,not critically acclaimed but i found this movie entertaining none the less. i like movies to take chances and this one does mixing a who donit suspense thriller with a sci fi twist. the blu ray video transfer is excellent and the audio will not disappoint.
1,Very disappointing movie!,"Okay, the young guy at the movie rental store said I would like this movie, that ""everyone likes this movie"". Well, maybe because I'm over 35 (unlike his friends), I DIDN'T like this movie, but neither did my teenage son who watched it with me! It's hard for me to put into words what all went wrong with it -(some of the other reviewers did a great job with that though). I'll just quickly say that I saw parts of The Ring, The Sixth Sense, Exorcist, and other movies thrown in and mixed all around in an attempt to make another ""scary movie"". Unfortunately, ripping off ideas from other movies didn't work for this one. In my opinion, this movie is not quite as bad as 28 Days Later, but close!"
2,I guess I'm going to be in the minority...but...,"I have to be honest. I didn't care for this one. Maybe I was expecting much more than what was delivered, but I kept looking for a deeper plot. Halle's performance was exceptional, but that wasn't enough to save the movie for me."
4,not alone,"i liked this movie a lot! its really different and errie!Grey works in a psyactric ward. One night she encounters a ghoast and when she wakes up, she is in the ward and is told she killed her husband but has no memory of it. The ghost she met still haunts her while she stays in the ward. Grey has to find out what was happenign to her and why she killed her husband and clear her name.great little twists and a very good story...i dont understand why critics didnt like this one...yea its horror but its not gory horror...is classy...and VERY good."
2,"A long, drawn out, AWFUL movie ...","This movie was so cliche modern horror flicks that it was pathetic ... the special effects were pretty poor. It had a great cast with really lousy dialogue. After the first ten minutes, it's pretty much a waste of time and brain! Don't bother renting this, let alone purchasing it."
4,pretty good,Gothika was a very good movie.The end seemed rather..blah. lol..no way to describe it. Halle Berry was good for the role.
2,Has been done before .... and done better,"GOTHIKA is a rip off of the excellent STIR OF ECHOES. A ghost seeks help from a person to ensure justice is done. Gothika moves along quickly which is a good thing, but the performances are wooden and just dull. Hal Berry winning an Oscar for Monster's Ball some years ago did not help her secure better roles, did it? Gothika is a clumsy and overall poor film. Give it a miss..."
2,So bad..yet I couldn't look away,"I thought this movie was terrible. Very stupid and unbelievable. Halle Berry was actually terrific though, and if it weren't for her, I probably would have turned it off after the first 10 minutes or so. Robert Downey Jr., who is usually first class, is flat and uninteresting and the general plot is incredibly ridiculous.What starts off as a promising story quickly turns into a circus, with Halle Berry becoming a patient in the very own facility in which she had practiced psychiatry just the day before (like that would ever happen). One day she is treating patients, the next, she is one of them. I'd tell you more but it's really not worth the time it would take to write it out. However, if you love camp and you can sit through the movie long enough, you have to watch the scene where the mild mannered buttoned up sherrif suddenly turns into a raving shirtless tattooed psychopath. Funny stuff."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"I have been a fan of all Dark Castle Productions past films. I couldn't wait to see this one and I wish I had. The film had a poor script. The acting from most EVERYONE involved surly was not top notch, although Mr. Downey DID pull his own weight. I left when the film was over, and wish I would have seen ELF instead. I want my money back."
2,Not waht it was made out to be.,"This movie was a huge letdown after all the hype about it. It's predictable and the story line isn't all that great. Also it wasn't really scary. After struggling to stay awake, I fell asleep watching it."
1,Horrible,"I picked up this DVD to prepare myself for a horrifying night..just after 10 minutes watching it,i wanted to smash the DVD!What kinda movie is this?Horror?Nope,there was no horror in it!!,Action??Nope..a thriller??Nope..nothing..Chucky in child's play was better than Halle Berry..For DIE-HARD Halle Berry fans only,Pick it up if you think that you have the spare cash to spend.."
2,"Been there, done that. Halle Berry was terrible!","Okay, this movie had all the ingredients to be a really good thriller but maqn did they screw it up. First off, Halle Berry's acting was horrendous. Everyone else (Robert Downey Jr., Penelope Cruz and Charles S. Dutton were believable. For some reason I had the feeling that Halle Berry felt that she was too good for horror. That she was beyond this. When you can't feel for the main character you already have a movie in trouble. Then when you take the plotline from Stir of Echoes and twist it around a little bit you come up with this terrible movie called Gothika. If you want to see a good movie with a similar plot watch Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. You'll be happy that you didn't waste your money and time on Gothika."
5,Very Good Story.,"Very good movie and it has a realy good story, If you want to sit alone in the dark and watch a horror movie, This one recommnded for you."
3,Ho hum,It all comes down to one thing. Black men wanting to have sex with white women any way they can. I really liked the special effects in this movie though. The best one was of Robert Downy Jr. driving a car. I mean like c'mon we're supposed to believe the sirector could keep him off cocaine long enough for him to actually get behind the wheel? It was the most effective Blue-screen effect I have ever witnessed.
1,Some friends of mine.,Some friends of mine have a 2 year old daughter.She's going through a phase in which she wipes her pooh on the walls.Looks like she's making movies too.
1,not worth your time or money,"I saw this movie 'cause I love horror, and I love Halle. But this movie just sucked."
1,stupidest movie I've seen in a long time.,I HATED THIS MOVIE. It is one of those ones that you keep watching because you think it may get better and it never does... stupid plot - too many holes and stupid ending.
2,"this women is a good acter, but has nothing on alica key's","alica key's needs to start being in movies,like i said this movie did not even move me or made me BUDGE!"
4,Great movie!!,"This movie is so well done. I loved this movie. You know when Hallie Berry is in a movie, you know that it has to be good. Remember, she is an Oscar-Winner, so she CAN act and is taken seriously as an actress. This movie is more Thiller, than hororr, but still, very good! A tad on the predictable, but a very good occult movie. I gave this movie four stars, because of it's predictablity. But, I have always been able to guess what was coming next with movies though, so maybe it won't be as predictable for you, as it was for me(which byt he way, was not much) I could barely guess what was coing next. This movie is fast pase, and never slows down for air. I could predict, I know I said that before, but just as a reminder. Hallie Berrie Fan? Then this movie, you'll love.Although, not sually her genre, she does a terrific job!!"
4,Rent it--very nice thriller that won't disappoint,"Gothika produced by ""Dark Castle"" was really quite good. Plot with twists and turns and an ending that was remarkably not what I expected. I like those type of thrillers. This movie actually frightened me, not in a ""punch in your face way,"" but a mild, creepy, gets into your head kind of way.Plus, it actually features a for once good performance from Halle Berry (without make-up--YES)Fantastic cinematography, good use of light to scare you, and a range of actors that are all quirky and have their own agendas.Dutton, Downey Jr. Cruz, Bernard Hill-all great."
3,Could have been better,"This movie had the potential to be much better. I wish they had included more scenes of the husband and what he was about. All that really stands out to me is all the screaming and running Halle did. She's a great actress and was great in this movie but I wish she would choose to make movies with a little more substance. This wasn't her worst. Cat Woman holds that honor, but this was certainly not her best."
3,It tried to be more than it was...,"What a spooky setting. Unfortunately, that's the scariest part of this movie, where and how it takes place. It could've been so good (if it weren't for the many unanswered questions and plot holes). But it seemed to be lacking something. It throws you into a nightmare before you really have a chance to care about any of the characters. It does happen along the way towards the end though. And somehow manages to be somewhat powerful. Near the end you kind of have a feeling what might happen (even if you can't quite predict exactly how). This movies tries too hard to be scary at the wrong moments. But in the end, turns out to be a decent story. The idea (for me about watching movies) is to escape reality for a while, and this sure took me away (to a place I wouldn't want to be for too long). This stayed with me a while after seeing it. ""You can't trust someone who thinks you're crazy."" Great line. This was a cryptic but entertaining ride, one that's worth seeing."
4,"""Logic is overrated.""","This is a supernatural mystery that comes across like a mixture of ""The Gift"" and ""The Sixth Sense."" Halle Berry finally proves she can carry a film as a lead actor with her frantic performance of a woman who no one, not even the audience, is sure if she is insane or not. I was hoping throughout that she was sane and that her innocence would be made clear, thus I was trying to finger the real killer during the whole movie. The plot kept me guessing about a lot of things: her state of mind, who she could trust(if anyone), who could the killer be? I was actually interested all the way through. My advice is not to try and figure things out, for the plot will unfold. Trust me. The ending even presents the possibility for sequels. Overall, this was enjoyable, if not completely realistic or logical. But as Halle Berry states in the film, ""Logic is overrated."" So get yourself a bag of popcorn and enjoy."
4,Worth the money,"As has been previously said,1. Au Contraire: Good song2. Memo to Human Resources: Good song3. Ant: Previously released on the Istanbul (Not Constantinople) single, but reworked, more jazzy instrumentation, outrageous solo at the end, with Hail To The Chief added in the President line, and some different lyrics. Can be heard mostly on Gigantic.4. Caroline, No: Good song5. Am I Awake?: Good songOverall value: 4 new songs and one reworking make this worth the price of admission."
5,Works great and worth the cost!,I decided on this type over the test and send out because I heard that radon can come and go (so testing once and getting a low rating doesn't mean anything). My neighbors best friend had 10 times the legal limit in his home and recently passed away from cancer so we decided to go ahead and get this. It gave an accurate reading within a few hours and is constantly monitored which makes me feel very safe in my home. Highly recommend!
5,Great product,"I am a realtor & deal with radon frequently. We recently built a new home & did a hardware store test kit & the results came back 5.1 pCi/L. I thought I would try passive methods to mitigate: seal cracks in floor, basement tub drain covered with plexi-glass & sealed & seal sump crock.Instead of spending another $40 I thought I would try the electonic monitor. What I have found is that short term levels fluxuate quite a bit. it has ranged from under three to just under 6. The important thing is that the long term level is at about 3.5 after about 2 weeks of testing. The long term results are much more meaningful than a 2 day test. I have found that during/after rains, the level seems to elevate.I may have a mitigation system installed at some point down the road to further reduce the levels & will have the electonic units results verified with another test.I would reccommend this prooduct for any home owner who wants peace of mind about the radon levels in their home."
4,"great customer service, great product","very happy with the results i am getting which seem to be completely aligned with what home tests did for us over the years except that we can do it often, around the house and it brings extra comfortgreat customer service as well from the company that manufactures this product, it turns out that the first unit we received had a problem with the display screen, I called them and outside of a quick trip to the post office, I got a completely new unit shipped at no charge within a few days"
3,It broke in less than a month,PROS: It gives you a digital reading of the Radon Gas andCONS: The unit broke down in less than a month
4,Provides a good data point,"This unit provided a good starting point for me to see if there were high levels of radon present in my home. I let the unit run for about a week and got back a reading of 22.8 pCi/L. This was obviously a concern, since the EPA recommends mitigation for levels of 4 pCi/L or higher. I contacted a professional to do a radon test to verify I had a problem. His units showed an average reading of 15.5. Even though the readings differed, this unit still provided me with the initial indication of a problem. I'm grateful that this unit was able to alert me to the problem, so I could take the actions needed to correct it."
2,Beware of the hidden costs,"I've had this detector for over 3 years now and it's true what they say about it needing calibration every year. This means sending the unit back to the manufacturer for service. If you don't, it tends to sneak up with progressively higher readings. Unfortunately, I found this out after I bought it. So here's the thing you will need to consider: you are paying $130 for 1 year of ballpark accuracy readings. After that it will cost you another $75 (+2 way S&H fee to Michigan) per year just to maintain the same reading accuracy. Seems like a high price to pay when you can have a professional come in yearly and give you a more accurate reading for about the same price. Granted, readings can change daily to weekly but in my three years of measuring, I've found that the detection range was pretty consistent (within 2-2.5 pCi/L seasonal differential). Now I have this $130 device that needs another $100 or so to make it semi-useful again."
4,This Product Bought Us Peace of Mind,"We placed the detector in our basement, and we've had it on since mid-August. When we were in the middle of buying our house last spring, a radon test showed a level of 30 pCi/L. Then the sellers installed a radon mitigation system before we moved in in late July. At this point, the monitor is reading 1.2 for short-term and long-term. The monitor is very easy to use.I suppose one weakness of this product is its level of accuracy in a situation such as ours--i.e., where we have a radon mitigation system installed so that our levels are now below 2 pCi/L. In other words, because the accuracy of the reading of this product is ""+/- 20% or 1 pCi/L, whichever is greater,"" we probably aren't receiving an exact reading. I'm encouraged to know that our radon reading is well below 4 pCi/L, but I would feel even better to know that it's below 1 pCi/L.In any case, this product gives me and my family peace of mind, and we consider it a worthwhile investment."
4,Nice and smooth handling.,"Nice and smooth handling, even transport to Norway. Remember its 110v, not EU 220v. I recommend this for insurance reasons, nice to now."
5,Radon Monitor,"The product was packed well and shipping was quick. Product is performing as described and is a much better investment than those ""one shot"" detectors that must be sent back to a lab for evaluation."
4,Faster and Better,"I bought an earlier meter about 10 years ago. The old meter died about a month ago. The new Safety Siren Pro Series HS7151 3 Radon Gas Detector gives more precise readings. I can't vouch for it being more or less accurate. The older version gave readings between 0 and 99 by increments of 1. The new gives readings between 0 and 999 to tenths of a picocurie per liter and mine now reads between 0.90 and 1.2, (Probably a normal variation depending on various factors) It does the job! I installed my own radon reduction system ten years ago. Our house at that time had readings going up to between 24 and 33 so I was pleased to reduce it to between a 1 and a 2. Whether or not you have a radon reduction system and you want to stay on top of your radon exposure you will appreciate this meter!"
4,Useful Tool,For my purposes this instrument is useful if not terribly accurate. I am using it to alert me to gross changes over a period caused by ventilation alterations. Tying up a sniffer or using a carbon test for every alteration is not practical for this step.
2,Not Accurate,Not accurate. The pro series measured the radon level in my basement at 10.9. The radon professional's machine read the same room at 5.1. The state lab.measurement of the same room was 4.5. So I returned this machine.
5,"Get it, don't screw with the $5-10 tests.",Why screw around with radon if you know you have a problem? You can use this sensor and move it around your basement/house letting it cycle for 2-5 days in each spot to narrow down the source. Find your problems and monitor them in real-time... Anyone who needed or needs a mitigation system should own one of these. Saving $$ now isn't worth it in the long run... If only the price of this unit could fix cancer... :( Might as well do all you can to avoid it!
5,Confirmed By Test,We purchased this unit and got high readings so we contacted a radon test company. They ran their test and the numbers came in right on the button with our Safety Siren Pro Series 3. Mitigation was done and a follow up test was performed by the testing company. (Testing and mitigation were done by two separate companies to avoid any conflicts) Now our always-on Safety Siren Detector provides a consistent way to visually check the current readings and also will provide an audible warning if the levels ever get too high again. Our mitigation system has only a visual method of checking operation and it's nice to have the audible backup of the Safety Siren.
5,Glad I bought the siren,Easy to use tool to measure radon level. It takes a few days to gather information but since then it I can follow the levels in my basement. Levels vary fro 1.4-1.8 so I know it's reading. This was within the range when I had the basement tested professionally some years ago. The device is small and doesn't show up too much. Keep in mind on the down side the meAsurement is up to 40 percent off as is noted in the owners manual. I hope they can narrow that range some day
4,Good radon detector for personal use,"I just bought a new home that came we a radon mitigation system. To keep track of radon levels in my home I preferred to buy this product over disposable kits. I am not an expert but this product seems to be more accurate and I plan to use it for many years so cost wise I will make out over the long run.After reading the manual I set it up in my home and it has been working fine. Technology used in this product, display/buttons, seem a bit dated but it is doing the job very well for me."
5,Worth it,Worked great and have not had any problems with it. I compared readings with a test that was sent to a lab and they were pretty much the same. I would recommend this product
5,Works,Product seems to work great plugged it in and started reading after required wait time. Bettert than the one time testers
5,great,I forgot I even bought this but it was for my mom so she could test her mobile home (she is in a park and just wanted to check). anyway i called her and she said it gave her peace of mind
1,Highly inaccurate,"The electronic tester showed a level of 9.4 to 10.3, and based on this I contracted mitigation with a contractor that guaranteed to reduce the level below 2.0. After mitigation the electronic tester showed levels of 3.1 to 3.8. The contractor supplied charcoal testers that showed the level to be 0.5. I purchased another charcoal tester that showed the level as 0.7. I then returned the electronic tester, then tested with an additional charcoal tester and the mitigation system off, which showed the pre-mitigation level as 4.9. Based on the pre-mitigation level of 4.9, I would still have contracted mitigation, but the electronic tester proved unreliable."
1,NOT EPA approved for real estate transactions,NOT EPA approved for real estate transactions. They tell you it was EPA evaluated.....So? I can evaluate anything...LOL. Even charcoal canisters (11 bucks) are approved for real estate transactions...........very misleading in my opinion
4,Seems to work,"I haven't tested it really, but the number goes a little higher by the sump pump. That seems like a good indication that it works."
3,An alright game,"Its a pretty fun game ,but it takes about 15 bullets to kill one bear. I say only buy it if you have patience."
5,Great Series,"The Capstick hunting videos are absolutely top shelf.I recommend the complete set.Cheers!Dr. Stephen W. Templar, Author: rexGunRexgun"
2,Plug and plea....,"I bought this product in order to get still pictures from my Sony digital camcorder onto my iMac because the Sony version was hard to get. I also have a Windows 2000 machine on which it worked okay (requires drivers loaded from CD-Rom). On the iMac though it is definitely not plug and play, it often fails to be recognized and the Mac extensions conflict with other USB devices such as my Iomega Zip drive. When working, it presents itself as a desktop folder on the Mac or a drive on a PC. On the Mac it sometimes does not appear or does not display new files. 2nd level Tech Support said I must trash the folder before removing the stick, and must powerdown the machine before unplugging the USB cable, but instructions don't mention this anywhere. Even then I still get fatal Mac errors if my Zip drive is plugged in on restart. All in all, a frustrating product to use, although I've no idea if the Sony version is any better."
3,Hope the Movie is better.,"I ordered and read this book due to the fact that the actors in ""My Dinner with Andre"" were going to make a similar movie wherein they discussed this book. I thought ""My Dinner with Andre"" was great and wanted to be prepared when this promised movie was finally made. I can't say I recommend the book to any great extent whatsoever. I'm sure it has been forgotten for a long long time and will continue to be so unless the movie is a blockbuster. Let's hope so."
1,Horrible,"This is the crappiest product I have ever purchased on Amazon. The mask came deformed and flattened and looks nothing like the picture. When on, the crown is misshapen and the face looks as if were used as a punching bag by Mike Tyson and Mike Tyson's right-handed twin. It bears no resemblance to The King at all and was totally unusable. Had to scrap the whole idea in favor of a Waldo costume! What a waste!EDIT: I actually bought this in August of 2008 so I apologize to the other two people who bought it after me. If I had been timely in my review, perhaps I could have saved you the frustration and financial loss. I am truly sorry."
2,Costume,"The mask smells like a old foot locker,I turn it inside out and kept it out side the house for five and it still smells"
5,Burger King Costume Rocks,The Burger King costume I ordered came on time and was really good quality would recomend buying any kind of costume through amazon.
5,interesting details,good book for student wanting (or needing) to know more about Thomas Jefferson. Interesting details & easily read.
1,"Depressing, boring ""art film""","Don't be misled by the title, cover art, or log line: ""Dare You Pay The Fare?"" HELLCAB is not a horror film.HELLCAB is a boring art film. It's about the depressing day in the life of a Chicago cabby. Each passenger gets one or two minutes of screen time, including ""star"" Gillian Anderson, who struggles with an Italian blue-collar accent.Film is a series of vingettes; nothing is ever resolved. We see the passenger, their situation set up, then go on to the next passenger."
4,"Wonderful, albeit completely mismarketed","...Also known as ""Chicago Cab,"" and based on the play of that name, Hellcab is one of those flicks that follows around a cab driver (Paul Dillon, a fantastic actor who looks like Flea, sounds like Flea two octaves lower, is as well-cast as Flea in the highly-underrated _Dudes_... well, you get the idea) as he picks up fares and wanders in and out of the lives of the passengers. Tight, funny, high-pitched. Small parts from Gillian Anderson, John Cusack (also one of the film's producers), and best actress 2000 nominee Julianne Moore in the kind of scene that makes us realize why she could be nominated for best actress. I mean, she's GOOD. My video store has this under horror, no matter how much I try to get them to change it. It ain't. Comedy/drama, and excellent comedy/drama at that."
4,a cool dvd,"I like john cusack and his movies, so yeah i think all the movies he makes are cool rock on man keep it up just wish i did not have to wait for them to come onto dvd all the time and only online since no store carries them"
4,American Sanity,This reminded me of a nonautistic version of American Splendor without being a mawkish predatory exploitive Hollywood take on working class American life like those South Boston accented movies.
2,Basic book for beginners,"This book was fairly basic. Not much information beyond what I have read in good Web developer-based magazines. Also, Galon is a fan of the exclamation point; you can find one is just about every other sentence. Plus, an editorial note for those distracted by typos and bad grammer: This book has quite a few of both. Overall, not a good buy. Look elsewhere."
1,"Miserably out-of-date, bad advice","This book is last updated in 2000.... yes, 2000. That is eternity on the web. It barely mentions Google and refers to many sites that are no longer in existance. Until the authors stop milking this version and write a new one, there are many better choices!"
2,Vasty Outdated,"When I picked it up I was instantly concerned that it was last updated in July of 2000. But as I started reading I found myself pretty surprised at the relevance of the information. That was until I reached the portion of the book the deals with search engine optimization. The first 72 pages of this book largely discuss the marketing aspects and needs of a website and most (not all) of the information provided here is relevant and useful. Beyond that, however, the information is old, outdated and rife with bad advice.The author continually claims that he does not believe in using spammy techniques, but then goes on to discuss the merits of using hidden text, invisible links, doorway pages, all things considered spam.I would not recommend buying this book. Most of the information is available (and refuted) online already, but if you do get a copy of it, skip pages 73-155 and 163-193. It'll be a nice quick read and you'll skip over the outdated nonsense."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,"I had nothing but problems with this product. The drivers do not install easily, I had to re-install them a couple of times. I even downloaded the newest drivers from their website. I tried to contact tech support that is supposed to be 24/7 according to the user's guide because I was having problems reading a 8 mb memory stick. They are only open during ""regular business hours"". I send them an e-mail and part of the reply was that the memory stick presently only reads up to a 64 mb memory stick. I tried to read a 32 mb memory stick and it destroyed the pictures. Luckily I could re-format the stick on my camera so it did not destroy the memory stick-just the pictures. So beware if you do want to purchase this product, that although it does not state this anywhere in the user guide or on their website, it will only read up to a 64 mb memory stick. And like I said, I could only get it to read an 8 mb stick, my 32 mb stick it wiped out. I can not recommend this memory reader..."
1,Beware,This thing DESTROYS memory sticks. I have 2 64MB cards ruined by this P.O.S. Out of nowhere I got a message that I had removed the device unsafely and it fries the memory stick. Beware
1,Viking RMSREAD/U USB Memory Stick Reader,"I spent 2 hours with Viking support trying to get this device to work. I have a new lap top with a USB mouse connected no problems (Plug & play had no problems). I was told by support that the CD that came with the reader was defective. The software from the web did not help. I am sending it back today, with a very strong letter to Viking.I have one work for plug & play devices that don't work - JUNKThe rating should be O Stars"
3,Not for Win98,Works well on Windows 2000. No documentation of substance. Not recomended for the novice user.
2,Too Large,"These glasses are humongous. Usually most glasses fit and look well on my face, but these are the largest things I ever put on. I ended up giving them to a friend, and they look good on him. They also felt a bit stiff. I wonder how long they would have lasted. You get what you pay for, even though I've gotten better glasses for less cash."
2,Too tight!,"These were well packaged and easy to return if you want to give them a try. My hat size is small and these were much too tight. They are well made though. Also, the ""case"" is a thin fabric bag, not really a case."
2,does not come close,"When I lost my original wayfarers I went for the cheaper alternative. They looked like the real thing and for the price I bought 2. As usual you get what you pay for which in this case is much less. Biggest problem is that they are so dark it's hard to see out except in heavy sunlight. The lenses are inferior, and frame not as sturdy.Glad I found the original pair again!"
3,2 broken,what i expected. a cheap but nice looking pair of sunglasses. they are the smaller ones. the only problem is when i opened the box two of the five glasses were already broken! made me mad but you get what you pay for.
3,Not as advertised,"Decent glasses for the price, but a couple gripes:The picture shown doesnt match up to what you get. I bought an old pair before and they were just like the pictures - excellent. But I recently bought another pair (paint was chipping off) and they're not even the same glasses.Dark black lenses are instead a lighter ""brownish"" lens - see thru. It's bigger/wider, as well as heavier than the old one, and there are silver ""studs"" (like the ones in front) on the side. I was hoping to get another pair of good glasses, but its not the same product."
3,Hotter than blazing,"3 1/2A tightly rapped, often inspiring success that continued to support this unit's stand-out in the field."
3,gutted,"Howdy America,I felt this album really lacked the style I've become used to. I think they are riding the glory of their previous acheivements, in truth I'd rate this 2 star or 1 but out of respect for what they did in the past I couldn't. The first track is good, great beat and the sort of thing I've come to expect from this lot. Sadly after that I could be listening to anyone, it's the combination of fast sharp lyrics AND funky instrumentation that makes up their style for me.poor show"
5,The gift to rip,"""I could have quit so quick, I don't know what I did to deserve a rap like this."" Next to Blazing Arrow this is one of the best alternative hip-hop albums around. Given that Blackalicious has done nothing less that release superior album after the last, they deserve your time to investigate this crew. Truely unique and if you like Dan the Automator's Deltron, then you should go looking for Blazing Arrow. However The Craft is more modern than the futuristic styles found in Deltron and Blazing Arrow. Still this is voted by so many mags as one of the best alternative hip-hop albums around and it shows. Just listen to the first and last track. Those kinds of tunes demand space on your iPod."
5,Give it a second listen,"Yes, the beats are unorthodox, but The Craft will really grow on you if you start listening to what Gab is saying. The lyrics on this album are fresh, insightful, captivating, funny, tragic, etc. Pop it in a discman and listen the whole thing through. You've got to actively listen to this, not just have it on in the background while you play drinking games with freshmen. This is the mirror-like wisdom.Also peep Kev Brown, Ohmega Watts, and AZ."
2,C'mon....,"I dont understand how all the previous reviewers can rep this album so much. This is a real digression from the sounds of Arrow and Gabs 4th Dimension. They should have released an EP with tracks 9 10 11 and 14 and put the rest in the bin.I dont think the Blackalicious of old would have accepted some of the tripe they dish up at the start of this album. I've invested quite a few bucks on Quannum sounds over the years, and this has been my most disappointing purchase.That said, when its good, its really, really good. Vintage, timeless... Automatique rocks my socks.If you're familiar with Blackalicious, buy it anyway. They deserve your loyalty on the basis of services to hip hop. If this is your first album, check the back catalogue."
4,Way better than if some guy (in jeans) had made it.,"This effort by the group is different from the rest in that it incorporates an almost 80's synth pop backdrop to the fast paced harmonic stylings of the rap group. Songs range from catchy and witty, to offbeat and uncharismatic. At first listen, the album appears to be all over the place and sloppy. But repeated listenings have made me understand the way the album was put together. as the album progresses song by song, it comes together more and more. It's quite an ingenious effort by the group. I say two thumbs up...and stright up some guy (in jeans) because his review would require me to pen a review of his review which would result in a review of a review of a review which would mean i would have to...oh you get the picture."
4,makyo will make you fly,"This cd is very beautiful. Its tribal/ambient/dub/trance at its finest. ""Chandan"", ""Shanti Shanti"", and ""Shingara"" are some very hypnotic, beautiful tracks."
3,Grows On You,"Hated it at first. Seemed like just more dance music. Almost no words. But over time, it grows on you. Even so, I think I'll stick to speed metal."
5,great book,"If you are just starting with greek, attempting to teach greek, or want to know if greek is for you this is the book. He taught through the book at a local church and my (then) 7 year old was able to grasp the major concepts. Very understandable format and he presents a very balanced view of translations and versions."
5,A Great Dark Comedy And Ms. Weisz Is So HOT!!!,"This movie is about two women who are caught in bad relationships until certain events occure to free them of their domestic shackles. These two ladies might be abused by their men but are in no way ""Profesional Victims' as so many women in Hollywood movies are portrayed.Ms. Weisz is beautiful as always and has a very sexy English accent and a great flair for comedy which is why I give this movie 5 stars."
3,Good movie,"This was a good movie; I enjoyed watching it, and I'm glad I got it, though it's still not one of my favorites. Interesting story line.Excellent on-line purchase experience."
1,Doesn't work,The cost is great but mine didn't work at all. DroidXOne thing about low price if you get a lemon they know you won't return it because of the economics.
2,Not for senior citizens.,I found the ear plugs fall out easy and were not comfortable. Got another type with one ear piece with soft plug and it much better.
3,"Nothing spectacular, but good enough for the money","These headphones worked fine for me, no problems hearing or being heard. They look decent enough too, however, they are not particularly well made, as one of the earphones started coming apart after a couple of months of use. For the price, though, you can conceivably get 3 or 4 and just change them every few months."
1,Not as shown or advertised,"This item is advertised and pictured as an OAK ball rack. It is not OAK. It is some unknown wood stained a dark black/brown color. I would return it but it was not worth the cost of sending it back.. I bought this to go on an Oak table and match the Mike Massey Oak 9 ball rack, (which actually is as shown-a light colored oak rack). This was truly a disappointment and a rip off."
2,Cheaply Made Rack,"This is a pretty standard rack, but it arrived dented and chipped with no invoice slip. It's not worth my time or money to send it back. You'd be better off going to a sporting goods store and buying this item."
3,Size Difference?,Got this item along with the Mike Massey Billiards Basic Billiard Balls and the balls did not fit the triangle as they were supposed to. There is a pretty large gap between the back of the triangle and the balls so setting them tight is a task.
5,This work is Winston Rodney's masterpiece!,This cd is a true work of art. It contains enchanting beats in true Spear fashion. These songs will allow you to recall a captivating stage presence and true reggae ambasador. I always include tracks from this cd on tapes for friends!
5,Intense,"This album shows Burning Spear at his peak. The music is very intense and dark, where the expressive vocal style matches the repetive grooves perfectly. Listening to e.g. ""Institution"" or ""Jah No Dead"" there can be no doubt that BS is serious regarding the lyrical messages."
4,Enhanced Version of Logitech PlayGear Pocket,"This is actually the enhanced versoin of Logitech PlayGear Pocket. Not sure if SONY ask Logitech to design this enhanced model. If you know about PimpMyPSP by Logitech which you can customize your cover, this SONY PSP Travel Case has the exact dimension for those customize stickers. I have both logitech and this sony case. I can tell you that nothing is perfect. SONY provides the best protection while sacraficing the weight and thickness. Logitech is a more prototype version which provides lighter weight. With only 12.93 on 3/23/2007, I'll choose SONY over Logitech's due to the extra storage space for UMDs and Memory Sticks, rubber feet for standing PSP up straight, and also the screen visor without physical contact with the PSP screen."
3,Works for 2000 only,this product works for the Psp 2000. The only way i found this out was when i actually bought the product.
3,could be better,"I've had my case for about a year now. I use it all the time and this is the main things I noticed about it. The case does its job by adding another layer of protection and some storage. The case is has a rubbery lining. The holders for the UMD's work fine. I do wish the compartment for the PSP ""grabbed"" and held the PSP as well. The hinged screen cover protects the screen but rarely latches. Since the PSP isn't held firmly in place it can rattle in the case and so, over the last year, the left edge of the hinged screen cover has developed a rub mark on the face of my PSP. Just to the right of the ""P"" of PSP. One last thing; you have to open the case to charge the PSP. It's not a big deal but they provide a cutout in the case to allow for this; it seems it should work then."
4,Almost what I needed,"I knew that when I bought my PSP I needed it to have some sort of protection. I noticed this fine little piece of hardware when searching for some case. There were a few deciding factors in picking this up over the other case out there:It is an official SonyIt carries to UMDs with the caseand the other reviews said it is very sturdy.All of these positives were true but there was one glaring weakness when receiving this case, it is just too big for a slim PSP. The case allows for the slim to rattle a little bit inside the case. So with a little modding, some laying around foam and krazy glue, it works great, now I just need to paint it."
4,it works ok,"it's a bit bulky.. but, i do like the screen protector, and extra storage(although,i havent used them yet)this isent for new psp tho. doesnt have a hole for new audio jack placement.i drilled a hole thru mine, but you have to be careful about it.hope this helps"
5,Good Shipment,"Shipment came as promised within a reasonable amount of time and was brand new as advertised. Straightforward, good service."
5,A Little Extra Insurance for Your PSP,"Well, you have to have this case if you are planning on keeping your valuable PSP working after a accident or fall! Its cheap and affordable, so why not put a little insurance on your entertainment. It prevents bumps, scratches and, even at times, the safety of the whole thing. The case is a stylish fit and I heartedly recommend it for anyone who owns a PSP."
3,"It protects your psp, but...","Sure, the polycarbonate casing and foam-ish interior will probably protect your psp when you drop it and the room for the umds and memory sticks are nice, but it also adds about an inch to the psp, making it both heavy and hardly portable. As for the screen protector, I can't really say whether it's a plus or minus since I also have a pelican screen protector already on the screen, but it does serve the purpose of holding the psp in tightly - maybe a bit too much. It's a pain in the but to have to unclip the case every time I want to switch games or movies, so I just keep the screen protector flipped back when I'm using my psp and snap it back in place when I put it away.To sum it up, I would personally go with the logitech case based on what I've heard about it, but if it isn't available this case is a pretty good case to go with if you don't mind the excess bulk.3.5/5.0"
5,Well worth the money,"You've read the other reviews. Snug, form-fitting rubber. A screen to protect the PSP screen. You can play games with the PSP in the case. All true. The big minus? The headphone jack is covered up, so you can't just listen to phones with the PSP in the case. That's a minor problem.Does it protect the PSP? Most definitely. I've had too horrible dropping incidents. The PSP was in the case both times. Both times the case came open and the PSP came out. Both times the PSP was unharmed. It would have been better if the case didn't open, but the way I see it, the case took the brunt of the impact, it opened and the PSP kinda slid out. (That's fairly accurate as to how both incidents played out.) The PSP travel case saved the PSP. I have not had a single problem due to the drops.Get this is you want to protect your system. In fact, I think it's as essential as a charger and Memory Sticks."
3,Too difficult to open...,"Let me first say that I am not a swearing man. Swearing, in my opinion, is one of the lowest forms of expression. However, trying to open this case, with the screen visor locked in, got me swearing like a sailor on a scurvy pirate ship. I finally managed to unlock the case by prying it open with a phillips head screw driver (not making this up).My suggestion to everyone who purchased one of these: In order to open the case more easily, remove the screen visor (it snaps out easily out of it's hinge). After that, purchase an adhesive screen protector instead.I STRONGLY recommend investing in a HORI PSP Screen Protector, from Amazon. You may also wish to file down the case hole next to the headphone jack, as it it quite difficult to insert a headphone cable inside the case.I regret not purchasing the Logitech case, instead. However, I modified this case a bit, making it more than suitable."
3,""" Not that good """,the travel case does provide good protection to the psp. the polycarbonate screen guard is great. it keeps the psp screen from getting scrathes but the protecter it self gets scrathced easily. it also provides 2 umd storage and 2 memory cards can be placed. the bad thing is the case adds weight to the psp. that makes it uncombtrable. its also hard to grip. i got a blister on my hand my accidently scrathing my self on the corner of this case. the matireal isnt soft. so all in all it really is up to you to deside if yuo want it or not.
3,review for PSP,"When you want to put in a different game, or different memory stick, you have to flip the screen protector open which is hard to do without scrathing the screen. Also, when you play a game with the case on, there are sharp points where you hold it. But, it is still very protective. Also, it can hold 2 games and 2 memory sticks. And finally, when you watch movies, you can fold the cover back and it will stand up."
3,Loose Fit,"Really good at protecting psp, but doesn't hold it in well at all. It easily falls out. This shouldn't be much of a problem with adults, but don't get it if your psp is used by young kids (who tend to grab it from one another & then the psp falls to the ground). It's a good thing the psp is a sturdy ""computer"". I do like the fact that you can plug everything in with the lid closed. Oh, if you buy this & have kids playing the psp, take it out of this case first, then no problem."
3,Doesn't fit PSP2000 well,"Sony needs to release a new version of this case. It does allow you to protect your PSP2000 but its a little lose in the case, and you can't connect ear phones while its in the case. They moved the ear phone jack on the PSP2000 and its doesn't line up with any of the access holes.Its still a good case for its protection value, but don't exepect the holes to line up with all the ports on the PSP2000."
2,PSP Travel Case,The Case isn't that great. The Plastic face plate won't stay closed on game. There are sharp edges that interfere with players hands/fingers when trying to play. This is a decent case for just holding game. Not for Playing it and keeping it safe at the same time.
1,A really horrrible case,Waste of money. Hard to get in and out of the case. So much so that my 11 year old doesn't even use it because they don't want to have to try to get it out. You cannot use the PSP in it easily either. Try something else.q
2,Don't buy if you have a PSP Slim.,"I recommend not purchasing this item as a bundle with the new PSP Slim. Amazon should of pointed this out, that the New PSP Slim does not fit snuggly in the case. I have drop this case twice and the PSP will fall out.I guess they(Amazon) expect people to buy it, then write a review about it. Instead of making Better quality insurance of the product, telling the consumer it ""DOES NOT WORK WELL WITH THE NEW PSP SLIM""."
1,It may look good...,"This case may look good, and sound good, but it is inherently flawed. Other reviews have stated that the screen cover is difficult to take off--they were not exaggerating. I'm just glad I tried it out before I put my PSP inside the case, because I would have damaged my PSP removing it. The only way I could release the screen involved jamming a screw driver into the latch. The case will not close properly if the screen cover is removed. Also, I found that, once I got the case to close properly, I could not open it up again without using excessive force. You would think that, since the case is made by Sony for the Sony PSP, it would be ideal...but this case is far, far more trouble than it is worth. Get a different case."
3,"Works, but...","Product is easy to use, just mix the 2 part epoxy. My problem with the product is that the repairs (patched or filled areas) are visible when top coated with Rustoleum garage paint. By visible I mean that the repairs are more glossy and easily seen. If that is not a concern, then the product fills / repairs as advertised."
2,Don't use on vertical surfaces,"The product says that it can be used on vertical surfaces, but it can't. When I tried to use it to fix a crack in my foundation, it wasn't viscous enough, so it just ran down the crack and puddled on the ground. I tried my best to keep troweling it up, but it wasn't successful. I came back a couple hours later after it seemed like it had started to set just to find it had run a lot more."
2,rustoleum epoxy concrete repair update,"Used product to repair large cracks in driveway. I tried several other fixes, including concrete and various compunds that claimed to repair cracks, but all failed to work. The epoxy seems to be a permanent fix. Only drawback so far is that the color does not match the old concrete. Perhaps it will in time. The box claims it is the color of concrete.After a Colorado winter and a hot summer the cracks have reappeared. The epoxy patch did not bond with the concrete so I now have cracks on each side of the epoxy. Obviously, I am disappointed and no longer recommend this product."
4,Floral with a relaxing lingering scent,"I bought this perfume because Spring time is just around the corner and I needed something on the lighter side. I have not used this perfume in years but decided to give it a chance since it was so reasonable on Amazon. At first it has a strong floral aroma but after a few minutes it has a nice calming scent that lingers. Overall a clean, floral, slightly sweet scent."
4,great,I usually hate avon and its products but I love this perfume. It is such a wonderful fresh scent. The smell is for a 'day use' but you can wear evenings too.
5,Awesome product,"I got this from my mom, for brithday one year, and people always ask me what I am wearing. Its smells awesome. I purchased the whole set through avon."
5,Great Scent,This was a gift for my sister. She LOVES it and has bought it for herself and for others.
2,Ok but not my style,"It smells ok, but there's just something about it I don't like. When I wear it I find myself thinking something smells weird, and realize it's me."
3,Beethoven 4.1,"Este disco, un DVD de audio DDD, es una excelente ejecución de la conocidaHanover Band, que lo que menos tiene es ser una banda, es una gran orquesta con su característico sonido ""brillante"". Trae dos posibilidades para escuchar (debe ser en un DVD players), una forma es en PCM (dos canales de sonido) y la otra es DTS(cuatro canales)que sería un 4.1 ya que se escuchan los dos parlantes frontales y los dos traseros más el sub-bajos. La obertura Leonora 2 es ejecutada con una calidad de sonido excelente al igual que la ejecución misma. La dos sinfonías también se escuchan en forma brillante. Es un agrado escuchar esta CD-DVD de audio."
4,Dogs and their toys,Not sure why but my dog Bones loves this think (but only the blue one for some weird reason). Since he's always chewing on something he might as well chew on this I guess.
4,Not for the lay person,"I must say it is an honor to be the first person to review this book. I read of all of Mr. Hillman's books that are not out of print. Being a lay person I found this one very hard to read. I did not have this problem with Mr. Hillman's other works including ""The Myth of Analysis.""The number of theories examined in this book is staggering to say the least. It is very hard to find a book as comprehensive about this subject as this book. Even encyclopedia Britannica refers to it.Anybody interested in the subject of emotion should read this book."
