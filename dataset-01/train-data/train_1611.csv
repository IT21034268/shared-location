2,Air Genius Lost in Talkie Walkie,"Air created a genius work in Moon Safari, and this quality was evident in their other early albums. This genius took ethereal synth and gave it an earthy timeless quality. Their earlier music became a soundtrack for our lives. One could listen to Moon Safari endlessly, and I was compelled to do so on many occassion.Air unfortunately abandoned this genius with Talkie Walkie. This new album instead sounds like a hazy version of modern British rock. The lyrics (why are they trying to sing themselves) are rigid, repetitive, and mind numbing. One tires of hearing the album play before it is over.I hope that Air will use its talents in the future for better purposes."
2,Quickly fades...,"After the let down of the last album, 10k HZ Legend, I wasn't too sure what to expect. As others have stated, Moon Safari was just amazing, but ever since, they haven't been able to recreate the irresistible hooks of Moon Safari and Premiers Symptomes.Surfing on a Rocket is about the only song that I find myself listening to on this CD. Definitely catchy unlike the rest of the CD, but it is a bit repetitive. The other songs I find I'll turn down the volume or skip. Unfortunately, Talkie Walkie will never be a CD I play repeatedly for myself or for friends. Better than 10K HZ Legend yet still not living up to what this duo is capable of.Check out the Premiers Symptoms (limited edition early singles collection) CD or the Virgin Suicides soundtrack, before adding this to your collection."
4,Two new classics on a very good album,"The ""Run"" and ""Alone in Kyoto"" are new AIR classics ... damn good!I was so lucky to fall in love with the ""Alone in Kyoto"" before I saw the ""Lost in Translation"" movie and found out it was in that movie - which just made that so much a better experience.The rest of the album is great, but these two stands out in league of ""La Femme d'Argent"" and ""Sexy Boy"" and ""Kelly Watch the Stars."""
4,New and Different,"Air take some different approaches to music and vocal progressions. This is an interesting album where I found myself figuring out the song in the first 30 seconds, enjoying it throughout, and guessing what was to come next. Great closing from Lost in Translation. This is one of the more original albums I've heard in a long time. Air has the balls to blow up a balloon."
4,Very good!,"I do like it a lot. But i'm not going to buy it. Since it's copy protected, i can't listen to it on my MP3 player. That's too awfull."
3,"Good album, but could be better","This album is a good, but not great. All the songs are pleasant and a few are exceptional, but overall it just sounds like an extension of their debut Moon Safari, only not as good. Not much new ground being broken for the duo here, although I guess it's understandable based on the poor reaction to their last two more experimental efforts. Still a good purchase, but if you already own Moon Safari, nothing here will really catch you off-guard."
5,It was GREAT,"This book is only a little over 100 pages long. I'm used to the 1000 page books from Microsoft and others. Some of the chapters were only 2-3 pages long! But...Jeff can pack more pearls of wisdom into 2-3 pages than others can pack into 1000.If you liked ""Who Moved My Cheese"", you will like this guide to unconventional thinking too.I also had the opportunity to hear Jeff speak at a Business Marketing Assn lunch meeting in Pittsburgh recently. He is as good on his feet as with a pen (oops - computer word processor).Great work Jeff."
5,"don't listen to the haters ""Louder Now"" is where it's at","Seriously, can't people write reviews that imply that they have some intelligence. No, you don't have to like the album. You can hate the album. Everyone is entitled to think whatever they want, but dissing TBS just because you hate this genre of music or having something against them being on a major label is so lame. It's about the music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... and yes, Louder Now does hold up to TBS's prior albums. It's definitely a rock record, and really displays the versatility of the band from the guitar, bass, and drum solos to Adam and Fred's awesome vocal's. Give it a listen. You'll be so glad you did."
2,ugh,"so ive been listening to tbs since tell all your friends (which was a great album) and was looking forward to hearing louder now. but i have to say that it definately was a let down. this doesnt sound at all like stuff that tbs would do-the only song that sounds like them is their single makedamnsure. everything else is stuff that you would expect from bands like yellowcard or story of the year (not to diss those bands, but theyre pretty much the epitome of pop-rock). overall i didnt like this cd, ill stick with where you want to be and tell all your friends. i wished id just have downloaded some of their songs instead, cause i would rather have spent the 15 bucks on something else."
2,not like the tbs i remember,"okay so heres the deal, tell all your friends... amazing absolutely wonderful. where you want to be grew on me after the first few spins. louder now was a huge disapointment, i wasn't expecting the world with this album and i did buy this out of principle but i feel taking back sunday lost what i feel was magical about thier sound. nothing on the album meshes well. and there is only one catchy song. all in all i feel this album is for fans only or newcommers to the sound i almost guarentee if you hold this to the same criteria as the other two tbs albums you are setting yourself up for disapointment"
5,solid... very solid,"I was very afraid that this album would bomb with it being their first major label release, and bands usually try to make the sound more mainstream (less original) so that it can appeal to a larger audience. but that is clearly not what TBS went for. it's true that Tell All Your Friends is basically a cult classic to thousands of people, but this CD is just the natural evolution, so just listen to it with an open mind. i myself love fast-paced songs the most (which is why Saosin is my favorite band), so i personally find that Spin and Error: Operator are the best tracks on Louder Now. this is not to say that any of the other ones are anything less than amazing (except Miami... the chorus needs much improvement in my opinion). don't compare this album to Tell All Your Friends and it'll be fine, i promise."
1,another talentless emo band..... not that there are emo bands with talent !,"High pitched squealing vocals, unoriginal lyrics, same old boring drumbeats, same old guitar chords, and no creativity..... However, a great way to make money out of all you fa**ots who buy this s*it. Any ""Alice In Chains"" album could wipe the floor with this sorry mess of a bandJesus Christ it's pitiful !!"
2,"After the first two CD's, this one disappointed me",Pick out the songs you like on it and buy them on iTunes. Buying the cd for more than $2 would be a waste of money.
1,What can I say...,"First, let it be known that TBS has been one of my favorite bands for years (since before you even heard of them I'm sure). That being said, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM. If you want to hear TBS buy one of the older albums, or wait for the next one (I still have faith in the guys). This much touted producer did a terrible thing to the band's sound, and has taken away much of the intensity that is TBS. He is not the only one to blame; come on Adam - where are those awesome lyrics you used to write? The album sounds thin, the music week, and the lyrics forced - rather than true and felt. This is the opposite of Taking Back Sunday. I'm sure it's a fluke and I'll patiently wait for the next one, now if I could only get my $15 back...."
4,A BIT dissapointing.,"Been a TBS fan since before TAYF (I had their demos). TAYF and WYWTB had some sort of ""magic"" to them, they were ""special"" albums, there was just something about them that made you listen to them over and over again. Their last album just doesn't cut it. In my opinion MakeDamnSure is the best song on this album and is the only song that deserves a ""Made by Taking Back Sunday"" title. The other songs are just plain regular songs. Would have given it 3.5 stars if possible. The album is not a bad one, I'd rather have it than miss it, but TBS could have made a better album any day."
3,"TBS isn't ""louder now""","this cd has me on the fence because one half of me loves tbs and anything they put out but the other part isn't agreeing. i figured i would completely fall in love as i did with ""where you want to be."" i agree with Jeffrey. i remember when i first heard about tbs and i was like ""where do they get their song titles from?"" because nothing was hardly mentioned in the actual song and now they come straight from them. tbs is still one of my all time favs but i wsa disappointed after purchasing the album."
2,Bring back the old TBS.,Very disappointing. Not one song has the enthusiasm or intensity that previous albums share.
2,Sigh...,"Sigh...I miss John Nolan so much. The group just isn't the same without him. I guess ""Tell All Your Friends"" will be forever my favorite TBS CD."
2,not as good as I expected,"I LOVE TBS, the last two albums were great. I have to admit that unfortunately I am pretty disappointed in this CD. I really only like two, maybe three of the songs. I thought it would grow on me, but even after a couple of listens I'm still not a fan. If you're going to buy a TBS album, you should stick with the first two."
2,TOO FIDGETY,"Where have songs like ""Eleven"" gone? Where is that lyrical ingenuity? Where are those lyrics that made ""Ghost man on third"" (the best EMO song ever written, in my opinion) ? I'm disappointed with this band. Like a fellow reviewer said, the sound is just plain terrible. There is no coherence, atleast not to an ex-fan of this band right here. I'm even more surprised to see that a lot of people have given this cd FIVE stars.When ""my blue heaven"" starts, I felt I'd hear something real. ""Divine Intervention"" doesn't deserve to be skipped. I don't know if I should blame TBS or their inspiration or the particular genre they intend to belong to. ""I'll Let You Live"" , like most tracks on LOUDER NOW, gives me a short attention span.My downloaded copy included a tune called Brooklyn - which is a great song ,really. Try getting it. Excellent vocals, guitar tuning and flow.Overall conclusion on the eleven tracks mentioned herein is "" Louder Now is for the tonedeaf. Get the new Incubus cd NOW."""
1,Nope.,"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.Trying too hard, but at the same time not trying hard enough.Void of emotion.Annoying, repetitive lyrics.The Taking Back Sunday sound has disappeared into a radio-friendly, phony record known as ""Louder Now"".Some of the melodies are even as terrible as Puddle of Mudd. Ewww.I suggest buying one of their earlier releases. At least they sounded like they had a soul in those ones.P.S.Tell All Your Friends is one of the best albums EVER MADE.Buy that."
5,The real talent left...,"but this band still rocks. Yes, one of their original singers left and formed the incredible Straylight Run. And gauging the difference between that album and the second TBS album revealed where the emotional aspects of their music went. Yes, the sequel was a little more Santa Clause 2 than The Godfather 2, but the third proves to be this band's Army of Darkness. Different than its predecessors, Louder Now is full of catchy tunes, giving you what you used to love in a new format. You may notice the keyboards and the slightly more indie feel. Yes, it's a forced attempt to garner more album sales, but at least you can sing along."
4,My girlfriend loved it!,I got this for my gf's bday and she loved the cd. It was pre owned but still in great condition as was described. Thank you!
5,Louder,"Insane CD, my favorite tracks would be liar, twenty twenty surgery, miami, and devine intervention. as for the dvd those guys are funny as hell, Nice too. But dont let the off stage antics fool you these guys are amazing music makers and i cant wait to hear more from them in the future"
5,<3 taking back sunday. just amazing.,"""Louder Now"" has to be one of the greatest achievements for Taking Back Sunday. The music stylings of this band has come a long way since ""Tell All Your Friends"" and ""Where You Want to Be."" It has more of a rock feel to it (hence the title: Louder Now). Opening this cd with ""Whats it Feel Like to be a Ghost?"" really sets the tone for the entire album. And of course with the hits like ""Makedamnsure"" and ""Liar(It Takes One to Know One)"" how could you go wrong? And if you need a short break from the loud rock sound, theres the quieter ""Divine Intervention"" and ""I'll Let You Live."" If you liked Taking Back Sunday's other albums, then your sure to love this one. If your a first timer, you'll still love this album. Taking Back Sunday really hit the nail on the head with this one. So don't miss out! This album is just great rock music at its best!"
2,WOW... i can't believe this happened,"i've been a HUGE fan of TBS since the begining, since when they were out of long island, and even after they switched members i was still ok because it happens. but this album is NOT the band i loved. they shed the victory record label for warner brothers?? what?? the music is over all good, they are still very talented, and i can almost garuntee if you haven't been with them since ""tell all your friends"" then you'll like this, but for the longer fans... i wouldn't even bother, they're just a shell of the glory they used to be..."
2,You gotta be kidding me,Taking Back Sunday has had two years to write this new album and it sounds like the wrote it in 2 weeks. This sounds nothing like the TBS I know. Every song sounds the same. The music is incredibly bland and the vocals have no passion like the first 2 albums did. Where is the back up singing?? This album is such a major dissapointment that i am in pain. The band is either really depressed or they've just lost it.
4,i wanna makedamnsure you get this album!!!,"taking back sunday has always been one of my favorite bands. i love all of their music, and ""Louder Now"" is no exception. personally i think they out did them selves on this album. makedamnsure is a great song, although the video is a little... odd. what it feels like to be a ghost, again great. liar (it takes one to know one) is awesome. get this cd if you dont already have it."
4,Better Now,"I never joined the TBS bandwagon. I thought they had a couple good singles, but never a good album. Louder Now changes that. It's a much more complete album than their other two full lengths and it still oozes emotion . The album starts out flawless. ""What it feels like to be a ghost"", ""Liar"", ""MakeDamnSure"", and ""Up Against"" are all great songs. The rest of the cd seems like more of let down, since it starts off so great. I'm just not feeling ""Twenty-Twenty Surgury"" or ""Miami"" at all. The rest of the cd is alright, nothing mind blowing, but tracks like ""Spin"" keep the cd going strong rather than withering out. Give it a listen, even if you aren't the biggest TBS fan. It's a solid album. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could, but since I'm in a good mood, I'll round it up."
4,Very Good Album,"In all honesty, this, LOUDER NOW, was the very first TAKING BACK SUNDAY that I've purchased. Let me also state that I was very impressed with it. The production is awesome, the vocals are very good and represent the ""emo"" idea very well. The album isn't say incredibly innovative, but it is what it is and that is a very fine album. My favorite song is ""Makedamnsure"" which is just an exceptional first single and it is no wonder it is doing well on the Billboard Hot 100. I also like ""What It Feel Like To Be A Ghost"", ""Liar"", ""Up Against"", ""Twenty Twenty Surgery"", and ""My Blue Heaven"" among others. Taking Back Sunday is an easy standout amongst the saturated emo/punk market. They actually have something to contribute musically and that is what makes them a very consistent band. With that said, I give this album 4 stars."
2,Wait...I'm confused,"From all the hype I've been hearing, with this album TBS were trying to go for a louder, harder album. Well, they've miserably failed. I don't know what that band is smoking, but have they forgotten how amazingly hard Tell All Your Friends was? It was a great album with tons of emotion, wailing guitars, smart vocals, and some truly amazing songs. I mean, you do have to listen to MakeDamnSure, but that's about it. In fact, go download MakeDamnSure and go buy Tell All Your Friends. Now."
3,a step backwards,"this cd is not a step in the right direction if you ask me. This is what happens when a band jumps to a mjor label, their music gets over produced and becomes boring. That's what happened here. They have departed from their raw and exciting sound that made their last two albums so much better. Tell All Your Friends is one of my fav albums of all time. Also, the used to have really creative song titles that made you think, now on this album the song titles are just the words from the chorus. And lyrically this is their worst album. If you are a fan of old TBS stuff you will be dissappointed by this album. It is more mainstream sounding than their earlier stuff. All that being said, it's not a bad album but I expect more from one of my favorite bands."
3,kinda disappointed,"I'm a big fan of taking back sunday, but this album wasn't as good as previous ones. I just couldn't get into it."
3,Taking Back Sunday - Louder Now,"I have all 3 albums and i just like the first 2 better, this one just doesnt seem the same as the other 2 it doesnt have as much emoition"
2,Very weak top third effort,"I had very high hopes for Taking Back Sunday's third album, Louder Now, following the incredible Tell All Your Friends, and the very good Where You Want to Be, however they failed to live up to any expectations. I expected them to deepen their sound much like their peers have done in recent albums. (Midtown's Forget What You Know and Brand New's Deja Entendu) However it seems like their moment on MTV with their last album has ruined them. The opening riff sounds like something left off Pearl Jam's Yield album and the album plummets from there. It sounds strangely top 40 and is predictable at every turn. The best song by far is Error:Operator, which doesnt speak well for the rest of the tracks, though this version is improved over the one released with the Fantastic Four movie. I wouldnt spend 5 bucks on this album to buy it used, and i regret dropping 10 on it new."
2,Disappointing,Been outta the country for a while and didnt even know a new album was coming out. Before i got the album i already searched for tour dates. Then i got the album. Not completely horrible... just not up to par.. no tour tickets purchased. Is this really the same guys?
3,Lyrics are lacking,"I'll keep it short and concise...this album is a disappointment. I consider TBS to one of my favorite bands so it pains me to say that there are only 3 or 4 songs that i actually like on the album. I think the worst part is that these 3 or 4 songs, the best on Louder Now, would never make it on to Tell All Your Friends or Where You Want to Be.When i listened to this album, the effort seemed rushed and uninspired. The lyrics are boring and lack creativity. What i'm really hoping is that as i continue to listen to this album a second, third, and fourth time, that it'll get better."
3,This isn't TBS...,"I was really pysched for this CD. IT's been two years since ""Where you Want To Be"" was released, and even though it didn't even come CLOSE to topping ""Tell All Your Friends"", it was still a good effort. This CD..just..they could have done so much better. The reason TAYF was so good was because of how raw it sounded. This CD sounds like another generic (as much as i hate to use this label, it sounds so stupid these days) emo band. TBS was such a good band, this CD had so much potential, they went to WB records and could have done something amazing. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because there are some saving songs on this CD. Personally, I thought ""Liar"" was really good, ""Makedamnsure"" and ""Error Operator""(which wasn't even written for the CD) were all good ones too. If you're a new comer to Taking Back Sunday, pick up their first CD before getting this. If you've been listening to them since then like I have, and were expecting something phenomanal of this CD...dont."
3,not good/ not bad,"TBS is an excallent band, i have been listening to them for a long long time. If you have the previous cds than id recomend it, itz not a bad cd but dont expect as good as tell all you friends or where you want to be. To any new fan who saw a music video on mtv of makedamnsure or heard about it from a friend i dont recomend this cd. Tell all you friends is so far the best TBS album and i belive it always will be."
2,Decent..........worth buying if you're a TBS fan,"So far it's ok.......but ""tell all your friends"" and ""where you want to be"" are MUCH MUCH better. #9 Miami is probably the only ""catchy"" song on the album...... but overall, disappointing."
2,sooooooooooooo disappointing,"recommended if you like: armor for sleep, panic at the disco, the academy is.I used to LOVE taking back sunday for their intensity and their desperate screams and their gritty but passionate sound. This is so ... every other band. every song on this album sounds like another band could have written it. Even the lyrics sound like they were written by someone else. I don't know, these guys have lost their edge. I was somewhat disappointed after John Nolan left the band and Where You Want To Be was released, because it was kind of lame how Adam Lazarra was imitating john nolan or something, but it was still that Taking Back Sunday sound. Now it's just generic pop-punk-emo, the only thing thye have going for them is sweet harmonies and the familiar voice. This is the transition album. I'm not really into it at all, but for those who have never liked taking back sunday before, this new album is really catchy."
1,Who sings this?!!,"Just to let everyone know that if your expecting this to sound like the ""Usher"" that we all know and love, you better think again!! I cannot beleive that this is the same guy that I own every CD of. What a disappointment! Its either from when he just turned 10 years old or its not authentic. Either way I don't think I will be listening to it again in this lifetime. So be warned and I only wish that I would have been. Usher rocks and this does not!!!!"
5,So far so good,"I have only used the flash a few time, but so far it has done me well. I feel like i got more flash then what i need, and ham vary happy so far."
4,Sony HVL-F36AM,"I got this flash in May 2008 with my Alpha 200 before a trip to Alaska cruise. I got it for about one hundred bucks, I think a very good deal for a genuine Sony product. The ttl autoexposure is perfect, but a little bit underpower to take indoor pictures. I used it to take my cousin wedding reception at a local chines e restaurant and I have to adjust my raw images to +1stop. I am not happy with the wireless capability of this flash, because the flash need to be in the front of camera in order to be triggered by incamera pre-flash. I meant it is not triggered by radio frequency so it works same way as a cheap photosensor with ttl autoexposure. Overall it's okay for 100bucks flash."
4,It's HUGE!,despite being huge...it meters quite accurately ..powerful flash...Sony ..you should try to have this same features in a smaller package.
1,terrible company,"Do not order from this company. Product was opened all over the inside of the box and the box was fine, meaning they packaged it damaged. They were suppose to overnight me a new one. Never sent anything. Finally got a refund, and they sent me the confirmation, but given the owner admitted to me that the company was on the verge of failing because of water damage to the warehouse, I'm skeptical if I'll even get that. Avoid this company like the plague."
2,Overpriced,"Fox Farm makes excellent products that retail for far less than what is offered here. Shop elsewhere, don't encourage price gouging. These ferts are worth about $18-$20 individually at most walk-in stores so $80 plus shipping is a blatant rip off. Support your local nursery.You will need these ferts at the start of flowering, so don't get ripped off when you buy them."
4,Engineered regimen of nutes,"Fox Farms have engineered a line of nutrients, when combined with their potting soil in a pot with good drainage pretty much have covered an optimal growing medium that requires good energy waves to provide the best home a plant could as for. Their nutrient system is fairly expensive. Fox Farms also sells; ""Big Boom"", ""Grow Big"" & ""Tiger Bloom"" for the main courses. Fox Farms also markets ""Sludge Hammer"" a flush. Lastly Fox Farms also markets ""Microbe Brew"" & Kangaroots. I also use 'black strap molasses' & get very good results if I'm growing healthy young plants and/or seeds. Expensive... but Fox Farms engineered system work very well just using Fox Farms ""Feeding Schedule"". It was actually possible to minimally alter your plants response to the photo-cycle."
3,Enough to last you until you decide to go organic!,"The item shipped as described. Seems to work well when you follow the feeding schedule, but at 1 tsp per every other watering, this 3 pack will last you over a year! Great if you are into chemical ferts but you will quickly ditch this stuff if you ever decide to go organic, as it will do a good job of killing the beneficial microbes in your soil."
3,good stuff bad packing,received my package very fast but unfortunitly it was in a gigantic box and only a couple air bags to hold it in place and they busted the lid off my beastie bloomz and it was all dumped out in the box luckly it was taped good enough that 3/4 of it was still in the box the mail lady was pissed handed me the box with green hands
2,Pretty Is As Pretty Does...,"What really attracted me to this item, besides the brand name, was the gorgeous design. I had read some bad reviews of it, but thought it might have been due to ignorance on the users part, and decided to try it out for myself.Turns out, the reviews were right. This remote must be programmed blindly, meaning there is no feedback to tell you when you are done or if you made a mistake. No blinking lights, no LED.After spending an hour trying to get it to control two of my components (VCR and CD player), I gave up and returned it.I purchased an RCA 6 device remote from my local department store and it works all of the components (some were already programmed) and has feedback (blinking lights) during programming.Don't waste your time with this item. Yeah, it's a nice design, but too bad it's not a good product."
2,Sleeves too short; neck too big...,"Not sure why no one can make a mock that actually fits well--sleeves were too short and neck was too big....would be nice if they had orderable sizes like dress shirts but then that takes away the mass production....fabric was nice, but fit wasn't..."
4,A Woodstocker Wanna Be,"When I saw this movie, I just knew I had to get this soundtrack. Music is from two genres of the time: the clean- housewifey-music, and the hippie-Woodstock music, to reflect Pearl's and Walker's backgrounds, respectively. I have to say, though, that whoever thought to keep Richie Havens' ""Freedom"" off the soundtrack made a poor decision. I made another copy of the cd and added the song myself by downloading it from the web. I now feel it is complete and I have it on continuous play on my surround sound, staring at my lava lamp and wishing for the first time in my life that I were older so that I could have been a part of this great era of music."
4,Classic music capturing an era,"Not only was this an incredible movie, the soundtrack captures the essence of the movie. There is such transition in the songs which was the same transition of the times...all leading to Woodstock and an awakening. These songs, not your normal mainstream, just time warped me back to a time I almost forgot. The mix is incredible (White Bird, Today, Follow...). The only complaint (why a 4 star and not a 5 star) is the fact that some of the songs aren't the original artists (Town Without Pity, Sally Go Round The Roses, and so on... but worthy efforts)"
2,13. Who Knows Where The Time Goes - Judy Collins,"I was just a teenager in the 60's, and I grew up in the same kind of household as the movie. But,, I had a little problem with the selection of songs used for the soundtrack. Track 13. Who Knows Where The Time Goes by Judy Collins, was originally written and sung by Sandy Denny. No wonder why Sandy Denny is hardly known in the United States. I also think Sandy Denny's version should have been included in the movie and soundtrack. Also, Richie Havens Freedom was left out of the soundtrack. The rest of the music I thought was really good."
2,Omissions,"As already noted, there are several very good songs omitted from the soundtrack. The 1st one that comes to my mind is ""Uncle John's Band"" by the Grateful Dead. This compilation is a poor effort by the producers, who obviously either didn't live through the late 60's or they were too messed up to notice."
4,Great soundtrack,"Excellent covers of Sally Go 'Round the Roses, Crystal Blue Persuasion and Crimson & Clover. Unfortunately the full 6:11 version of White Bird was cut to 3:10. That means, that the long beautiful violin solo for which the song is noted, is largely missing."
2,Sorry,"Sorry, but one of the best songs in the film is left off the CD: ""Israelites,"" by Desmond Dekker. I almost bought the CD by accident, thinking that this reggae classic would be included. It's played during a very tender moment in the film--perfect choice of music. Too bad it's not on the CD."
2,walk on the moon cd,"The music is great, just the quality of the CD is mediocre, some songs are scratch and the sound is poor.I kept it because I didn't want to spend any more money sending it back."
3,Just a Note to Clarify...,"Since I can't edit my review, I just wanted to clarify a poorly-worded section that willzep noticed: it was not my intention to accuse Jack Kirby of being ""embarrassed"" by the ""kids' stuff"" of working in the comic book field - Kirby's attitude was exactly the opposite. However, that was the way the industry treated all comic book creators, Kirby included. What limited Kirby's choices and forced him to play along was the fact that there were only two comic book companies he could reasonably expect to work for - DC and Marvel - and in the end, it wasn't really a choice at all. (BTW, guess I can edit my reviews! But that would be wrong...)"
2,Good subject. Poor writing,"I picked up a copy of this book at a used book store. I am a big Kirby fan and enjoy reading ""behind the scenes"" stories of the golden and silver age comic industry.While I enjoyed reading more about Jack Kirby I did find the book disjointed. The author would be writing about some event and suddenly stop and start writing about something else. And then come back. Very strange. Ronin Ro's jumping from subject to subject made the Lost time travel storyline seem simplistic in comparison.I recommend the book if you find it at the library or can pick it up cheap - after all it is about Kirby and Lee. Just don't expect great writing."
3,Interesting but not definitive,"I suggest you do what I did and borrow this book from the library (or wait for the paperback!). Many of the other reviewers have touched upon elements of what makes this book good and bad. Ro does a good job of evaluating Kirby's enormous contribution to the artform and to Marvel Comics in particular. But the story of comics and Kirby's place in it, is in my opinion, inherently interesting - it shouldn't be that difficult to write a 'good book' on the subject. But, as other reviewers have pointed out, the clarity and organization of his writing leave a lot to be desired. I also feel that the writing is a little 'flat': often times, it feels as if he's simply regurgitating information gathered from personal interviews. some of it appears to be marginally relevant at the best of times. And how reliable can a person's memory be after 40-50 years?If anybody thinks this is definitive they should read 'Men Of Tomorrow' by Gerard Jones."
2,Needs photos and an editor,"It's a breezy book that suffers from some glaring editing problems. Ronin describes Kirby's Army service with some nice stories, but the author also mentions that Kirby returned to the USA in 1943 - even though Kirby landed at Normandy 10 days after D-Day, which places the King in Europe in June 1944. Ronin's description of the National/Fawcett lawsuit implies that settlement was reached in the mid-40s, but Fawcett actually settled in 1953.Ronin does a good job of describing Kirby's work habits, when well as Kirby's later years as the King's memory started to go.But the book really, really needs photos and illustrations. They're essential parts of Kirby's story, and there's nothing inside the book. There are two drawings on the cover. The author spends a good chunk of the book discussing Jack and Roz Kirby's marriage - but there isn't a single photograph of them in the book. It's a shame."
5,Tales to Astonish - Astoundin!,A great insight into the life of Jack Kirby and sheds light on the creation of those fabulous Marvel Superheoes!
1,What Jack Kirby Did on his Summer Vacation,"This book is written like this. This is how Ronin Ro writes. ""This guy reads like an eighth-grade book report,"" I quipped to my wife. She laughed. The whole damn book. Written exactly like this. Don't buy it."
3,Not for infrared sauna,"Bought 4 of these to use in infrared sauna I'm building. Arrived quickly and in good shape. However, these are 130 volt bulbs, and not hot enough for sauna."
1,Viewsonic doesn't live up,"I directly compared my new Viewsonic P75F+B with my old NEC FE700+ and suprisingly found out my old NEC produced the sharper picture for text. The aperature grill design of the Viewsonic could not out-do the NEC.I bought a budget Viewsonic model 5 years ago and was not satisfied. P75F+B is my 2nd Viewsonic monitor. I wanted to give a high end Viewsonic a try. On screen controls are good, but the Viewsonic P75F+B produces just an OK image, certainly not what I expected from their Pro series monitor. You can be sure that I will not buy a Viewsonic in the future, unless it sells for less than one dollar."
3,Not the best but OK,"I think that this was rather boring, but it realy leads up to Jedi under siege, which is among my three favroites. I love this series, and think that this is a great book despite that. If you have already read jedi under siege (as I had when I read this book) you will find boring, but if you just finished Lightsabers it is very suspenceful as you wait to see what will happen to the Shadow Acadmey and Luke's Praxeum, or jedi acadmey as it was called in the Jedi Acadmey trilogey."
4,This book was only just above average.,"Now, only a few months after the explosive book Lightsabers took place the second imperium is planning an attack on the Wookiee world of Kashyyyk. Lobacca and his friends will be arriving on the planet to help Lowie's sister through her rite of passage.This book was written by two of the best and brightest Star Wars writers yet. Although a good story line was involved, I have seen better from Anderson and Moesta. If you haven't read the YOUNG JEDI KNIGHTS series before, then I suggest that you read them before reading this book. The first time I read it I was totally lost because I had never read any of the other series."
2,Lacks depth of Jedi's true ability,The force is afield of infinite potential.Experiencial understanding is the only way tocomprehend its true nature.
5,Outstanding switch.,"The Netgear switch is just what I needed, and came at a very reasonable price. I had it connected it up and working in a matter of minutes. I highly recommend it to anyone who is in the market for a gigabit switch."
1,Disconnects All Systems and Dies,"I am unbelievably frustrated by this product. I had this connected to a firewall to connect two computers into a subnet. Every 5 to 15 minutes the switch simply disconnects everything attached to it. At the switch all lights except power are turned off. The only way to recover the network is to power the switch off and on, and then the problem repeats again in 5 to 15 minutes.I tried removing each computer from the switch to see if that changed the result and it did not. I then tried to swap a brand-new-in-box GS108 in as a substitute and I get the identical result. So the defect is in the unit's firmware or in its design, but such a gross defect from a major network company is totally unacceptable.Do not entrust this switch to any mission critical task. I had to come into the office at 1am on Sunday night to debug this and find a reliable temporary substitute."
1,Dead after 1 year,I bought this 1 year ago and slowly one port after another started going dead after about 6 months of use. Now all the ports are dead and the switch seems to be in a continuous reboot mode. This is my first Netgear switch and I am not sure I would buy another.
1,Two of them died after 1 year,"Worked great for about one year. Then the flashing green lights of death that others have documented started. Just thought I'd add my vote to avoid this product. UPDATE TO REVIEW: I originally bought these in March of 2007, the first one died in September 08, the second one died December of 2008. The second failure wasn't as obvious and sat off in an office. The failure mode brought our entire network to a crawl until we found the culprit and unplugged it. I noticed on Netgear's web site that Prosafe products purchased after MAY of 2007, have a lifetime warranty. Leads me to believe they must know they built and sold most of the JUNK prior to May and don't want to correct their problem for those of us who bought back then. That tells me all I need to know about Netgear. It's on to DLink."
1,"Flaky, bad news","This switch made my network life miserable for a long time with intermittent problems that were not cured by power cycling, changing all cables, changing computers, etc. I didn't realize this switch was my problem for a long time, and now I'm looking for a replacement. It sure won't be another one of these."
5,Great extension for our Router,I purchases this in order to have more Ethernet ports to wire my house system. It was easy to install and we have not seen a decrease in bandwidth as a result. Overall a good buy.
1,Failure,The switch failed after only a few months of operation. I was using this switch to route video from IP cams in the house. Find a better product. This is the 2nd identical switch to fail. Not an isolated incident.
4,So far so good,"Switch has been online for a couple weeks and has not given me a problem. I rated 4 stars because the ethernet plugs are on one side and the power is on another. I knew this was the case before purchasing, so I should probably give it 5 stars, but you could buy another switch for a similar price point and get everything on one side."
2,Great until it broke in 5 months,"Bought this switch for the jumbo frames and supposed enterprise-level durability. I found that the switch worked well for 5 months, but one day I found all the lights blinking and it no longer worked. I gather this isn't a rare occurrence for the product. It did seem to get pretty hot while it was still working. Possibly it needs more air vents."
3,sturdy but unreliable,"I like the looks of Netgear consumer switches because of their metal blue casing, the presence of Kensington lock slot (for gigabit models), ability to mount them easily on the wall and their general sturdiness. However, Netgear seems to have quality problems. This 8-port switch died after 1 year or so (as happened to many other people) and was replaced with new one after sent to back (here in Europe 2 year warranty is common). However, I still believe Netgear will get its act together in the coming years. My first Netgear was 5-port hub and have bought 2 Netgear switches in addition. I will probably buy another Netgear switch (different model) in the future if it's needed but should it fail it will be the last one from Netgear."
2,dies quickly,"Works very well while alive, but I've seen 3 of these die already; average lifespan seems to be a shade under 2 years."
1,disconnects PC's,I have this in my wiring closet connecting multiple routers in my house. The whole house goes down every few days to every few hours. Won't buy another Netgear product.
2,Died after 4 years,"No problem setting it up, performance was fine, the case is durable. However, it just up and died after 4 years of use. Maybe that's par for the course, but it's the most expensive switch on my network, so I'm not impressed. I'm replacing it with a D-Link 8-port gigabit, I already have one of those and it's still going strong."
1,Netgear Failures,"Over the years I've purchased many Netgear, but in the last three it seems I have port failures on new equipment frequently. My 9 month old GS108 died a horrid death one day, I kept it on a mondo surge suppressor and have pretty high quality power anyways. At any rate, I've had other netgear failures, originally consumer quality so I started purchasing the Pro line thinking it would be better. Not so much.My advice, avoid the brand - they have quality issues.By the way, talked to tech support and the person told me that the problem was using a surge suppressor. He wanted me to plug it directly into the wall.Honestly, I think they would have replaced the device free of charge, my problem is that their products keep dying. Better to pay for a product that will last 5-10 years then get another defective product albeit free. I've switched to d-link, I've had good longevity at a work site with their products."
3,"Failed after 2.5 years, but worked well.","It is interesting that there are MANY reports of Netgear GS108 failure after 2+ years of usage.Now I have to join the club!Mine was working well 2.5 years, but now it reboots every 2-5 minutes. I expected a switch to last way longer. Going to replace immediately."
1,"2 failed units, not reliable","Echoing other reviews here, I've had the GS108 switch for a few years, and have had an ""all lights blink on and off"" failure on my replacement of the first one that had the same issue. I'm going to see how much it costs to have it replaced with a refurb, but I'll probably end up buying a TrendNet. Not really into shipping stuff around repeatedly or dealing with support. When it was working, it was perfectly fine, if a bit warm. And this is ""only"" about two failures over four or five years. You might get lucky! (Buy something else)"
5,Excellent Unit,"Small, compact, gigabit switch featuring a solid metal case, passive cooling (no fans), 2 LEDs per port (for connection speed, activity), a switch-mode power supply, and jumbo frames.I love it for those reasons."
4,So far so good!,I've used the FS line of switches before I've got the GS108 and they've been extremely reliable. My FS108 has been running solid for about 8 years now and I'm expecting this GS108 switch to do about the same. Moving up from 100Mb connections to GigE is fantastic. Now the network is able to keep up with the hard drive read speeds rather than severely bottlenecking the traffic.
3,Capacitor Fix for Faulty Netgear GS108,"Anyone who has one of these Netgear switches that died after a year or two should Google ""Netgear GS108 capacitor"". If you are handy with a soldering iron, you can quickly fix the problem yourself for just a few dollars by replacing two blown capacitors.(This is not intended as an excuse for Netgear shipping such shoddy product, nor is it intended to encourage more people to buy the GS108. I merely wanted to help inform people who already own this product that they can revive dead units.)"
1,"The tech details for this item are wrong, no web interface snmp etc.","I ordered this switch based on the technical details listed, but in fact this switch is 'unmanaged' no snmp, no web interface, no qos, no port channel, no port mirroring etc, if you want that switch like me, get the GS108T (thats the technical details they used for this product)For a unmanaged switch it seemed fine, just not what the technical details listed.."
3,Worked for 2 years and just died,"This was a great little switch, very sturdy, solid. Lights are nice Gigabit vs 100M vs 10M. However, I'm now concerned about its longevity. I've had it on constantly for 2+ years (bought it from Amazon.com in Nov 2007.) However, in the last 4-6 weeks the switch started to fail. First the performance of my computers on the switch degraded, now the whole switch has just stopped working. The 10Mb light is flashing steadily and my computer complains about the cable being unplugged! Ugh. Registered the product with [...] and I'm waiting for the response from Netgear support. I read in a forum that it may be the power supply? Will update this review as I experience Netgear support."
2,BAH!,"Well, it's a great unit but after 2 years of use the capacitors in it blew out and now it's a doorstop. I guess the question is how long should a gigabit switch last? Far as I'm concerned, with the rate of technological advances in the world, something like this ought to last until it's 'old school'. So I'm an unhappy camper. Overall I've always bought Netgear products when there was a choice because I've felt they were well built units. I've got several 'old school' routers/hubs/switches from Netgear that are still working so perhaps this is just a cheap-arsed unit...dunno. I'm off to find a non-Netgear unit to replace the GS108. sigh."
2,Premature Death,"After almost two years the switch started making a high pitched noise. About a week later it died completely. All the link lights flash at the same time and no traffic is passed.My network is now down until I either use the free RMA process and ship my switch off to them, wait for them to receive it, and then wait for them to ship it ground or pay $20 or $50 (depending on type of shipping) and get another switch sent to me first. Awesome."
5,Easy to use network upgrade,"If you transfer large files to/from another computer or NAS this is an appropriate upgrade. I need to transfer upwards of 20GB regularly and was tired of waiting for it to complete using the good-old standard 10/100 ethernet gear.When configured properly, this cut my transfer times by an order of magnitude as one would expect. I just had to make sure the NAS was setup to handle jumbo frames. If you don't to this, it is likely you will not notice a performance improvement.The switch was ready right out of the box. No configuration was necessary unless you really want to use the management features."
1,"Be aware of th bogus ""Lifetime Warranty""","I was attracted by the ""lifetime warranty"" and bought it from Amazon.The product broke after 1.5 years. It stopped working and all lights were flashing. When I called the support line, was told that I have to purchase the 3yr service contract in order to let their technicians to look at the products. The contract would cost about $30, but no guarantee that they would accept the problem and order an RMA or replacement for the ""lifetime warranty"". If you add the possible shipping cost that they are going to charge.... It's like buying a new unit!NetGear has to do a better job when claiming ""lifetime warranty""Very unhappy about this business practice.... Be aware of the ""Lifetime Warranty"" from NetGear."
3,"Great switch, lousy power supply","I've been using this switch without any problems since I bought it just over two years ago. Then a couple days ago, I noticed that a couple devices connected to it had no connectivity. Later in the day, none of them did. Eventually figured out it was a dead power supply. ""No problem!"" I thought, since the GS108 has a lifetime warranty! But, after contacting Netgear, I found that the warranty is only on the switch. The power supply only has a two year warranty. Boo. Of course they said they'd be happy to sell me a new power supply. No thanks, Netgear. I'll take my dollars elsewhere. So, in the end, I recommend the switch, but it's wise to have a spare power supply on hand if you can't afford the downtime while you hunt for a replacement."
4,has worked well for me,"This product works well for me. I have three wired computers connected to it as well as my Netgear WG102 wireless access point. Upstream from the router is my Netgear FR114P wired-only router and from that my Motorola SB5100 cable modem. I've had this setup for 6 months now and no lockups or wierd reboots from any of the equipment. After dealing with flakey networking problems for almost 3 years from various equipment, I now swear by Netgear ""blue box"" equipment. (And I've had issues with Netgear consumer ""white plastic"" equipment, among other brands of consumer equipment.)Giving it 4 stars as other gigabit switches now have more cache than this model."
1,Disappointing - Netgear aint what it used to be... :-(,"I used to swear by Netgear during my years of corporate IT servitude, but it seems that they've really abandoned any quality goals when it comes to their consumer grade equipment. This is the third (and last) piece of almost brand new Netgear equipment that is sitting in my parts closet unused.Every couple of hours it will disconnect all the users/devices attached to it. This disconnect would last anywhere from 15 seconds to a minute or more. Definitely puts a kink in large file transfers, video streaming and online gaming.I got a D-Link gigabit switch to replace it and couldn't be happier.D-Link DGS-2208 8-Port 10/100/1000 Desktop SwitchI must admit I prefer the build and look of the Netgear (it's solid and the rear facing LEDs are great) as opposed to the D-Link's plasticky lightness, but it's all about performance, not looks now, isn't it?"
1,I don't recommend this product because it fails within a year,"I purchased this product about a year ago. Today it failed with the well documented ""Blinking Lights of Death"". (I only wished I had read the reviews on a different site before buying). I called Netgear and it took me about an hour to get them to honor the warranty. (They tried to tell me it was under a 90 day warranty, when the box clearly states 5 years). I will get a new (rebuilt i'm sure) one in the mail in a couple of weeks. Meanwhile I'm buying a new HP switch. I will use the Netgear as a backup."
5,Best unmanaged switch you can get.,"I'm upgrading from an older 10/100 Netgear 8-port switch, so as comparisons go, I'm perfectly happy. I'm very happy about being able to increase the Jumbo Frame size so that those Gigabit speeds go even faster. I also like that actual switch form factor size is smaller than my older model.The next 'upgrade' would be to get a managed switch to do VLANs and such, but for a SOHO product this does great."
2,Was great but disconnects still,"The switch was great for a year, then it died completely, so I sent it in under warranty and it was repaired, then the disconnect issue started. We ended up having to come in at all hours to reset this switch. It would just disconnect and our lan suffered and many people were pissed off. Moving to something more reliable."
2,Power Supply Is Garbage,"I have always used Netgear products in my system setups because of the quality. This is no longer the case. The unit itself appears to be built as well as ever but the power supply is sub-standard. The old power supplies contained a transformer and were those big, bulky, heavy things that we are used to seeing. The new ones are these cheap little things with no transformer. I plugged my unit in twice and the second time, the power supply fried. Doesn't matter how good the unit is if you can't power it."
2,Not very reliable,"I had two of these fail within a year or two. I was too lazy to pursue any sort of warranty repair/replacement. I wouldn't buy this product again. Instead, I now useHP ProCurve Switch 1400-8G 8-Port 10/100/1000 Gigabit Network Switchwhich has been flawless."
4,"Works great, could use some cable management","I've had this router for a while now and it's fast (gigabit-capable devices connect and transfer at the speeds you'd expect), reliable, and runs much cooler than some older switches I've used in the past. The only thing stopping me from giving it five stars is the cable management, or lack thereof. A switch of this size is most likely going to end up on or under a desk rather than mounted in a rack, and having the cables and status lights all on the same side is a drawback. Assuming you position it so you can see the status LEDs, you end up with a rats' nest of cables that come off the front. For a desktop-style switch, either 1) having the ports on the back side and the LEDs on the front, or 2) providing some method for managing the cables, would be preferred."
2,Subpar,"Great construction, its nice and heavy, but I hardly get over 100 megabits, and no where near the speeds I get when I just wire my machines directly together. I'm not completely certain if mine is bad, or they're just poor in general, but with my experience, I would not recommend this."
1,DO WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT,"This is a bad product. It is not compatible with my multiple devices like DELL laptop etc. that make it virtually useless.Its support phone line is a garbage, horrible support from their oversee team(must be cheap) bad attitude, poor technical knowledge, far from professional way."
5,Netgear GS108 ProSafe 8-Port Gigabit Ethernet Desktop Switch,"At first switch didn't want to recognize all devices hooked up to it but after about 30 minutes of trial and error it just started working. Its a good switch especially for gaming on PS3's. The only thing I wish it had built in was wireless, then I would be able to get rid of my router which is only 10/100. This switch is 10/100/1000 for faster Internet speeds."
1,"Cheap power adaptor, expensive to replace","Although the switch itself has a ""lifetime"" warranty, the power adapter is only warrantied for two years. Our failed after about 2.5 years, and Netgear charges $27.00 for a replacement with is close to 50% of the cost of the switch."
5,A workhorse,This NetGear switch has been working without a single restart for over a year in my house. Worked on day one and continues to work. Easy to step up too. I fully recommend it.
5,Great little Gig Switch,I'd bought one of these for over $100 only 8 months back when I built a machine that had a Gig port on it. I got this 2nd unit for less than $50! It works well - power it up and connect - nothing else to do. Highly Recommended.
2,"Original failed, so did replacement","I've owned and installed many Netgear products and this is the first one that has given me significant grief. The originally purchased device failed within 5 months and the RMA was backordered for a couple weeks. The replacement worked well for a over a year, but then failed as well. What good is a 5-year guarantee if I must repeatedly spend time explaining to Netgear that it has really failed and then pay for shipping on RMA's? I would pass up the ""bargain"" price because it may cost more than expected in time and shipping."
2,Great product while it works,Bought 2 of these and they both worked for a day. 2nd day one started getting flakey. Works for about 3 minutes after power cycling. I'm not a happy camper. These felt much heftier than my previous DLink 10/100 switches. Not much good if they don't work. I'm going to return one under warranty and hopefully the new one works. I need 3 more but I won't buy any more Netgear products until I get more satisfaction. Buy with caution!
5,Very nice Gigabit Ethernet Switch,"This is the 3rd Netgear ethernet switch I purchased (the other 2 are only 4 ports). It's built well (has a metal casing, no plastic here), compact and is a simple plug-and-play design. A highly recommend product if you have a need for one of these. I have one of the ports hardwired to our main router, then from this switch attached are: HTPC, Bluray player, Apple TV, ROKU (2 of them, one for HT and other for living room on other side of wall), and the AVR. It does not have any issues, even when doing multiple streaming of HD videos (you do need a fast internet in the first place)."
2,GS-108 isn't compatible with some devices,"I've never had so much trouble with a network switch -- they're supposed to be almost invisible and not create any problems, Right? Wrong...The GS-108 is incompatible with my Sonos music system (as documented on the Sonos Web site, which I didn't even think to check before buying the switch), and I'm not sure if it's the Sonos incompatibility or other issues, but ever since putting in the GS-108 I'm having all sorts of problems on my network -- duplicate IP's getting assigned, inability for some computers to see the Internet, my Netgear NAS becoming invisible to some systems, etc.I have all Cat-6 cabling and was really looking forward to moving to Gigabit, and when it works, it's great, but I'm in the process of moving to another switch because the GS108 is causing too many problems."
4,Router,This items works well and you can tell if you are making a connection when looking at the router. Seems to be well built and works well.
5,An amazing story,A truly heartwarming and inspiring book about Father Joe Maiers life with the poorest in the slums of Bangkok. The strength of the people he has met truly gives a further understanding about life.This is an amazing read and I truly recommend it!
4,positive reaction,"Received in a timely manner. Read in a couple days. Very eye opening, and made me want to help this ministry."
1,Not made in the U.S.A,"I purchased this scale for soap making and it will serve that purpose just fine and it looks sturdy enough. I felt I had researched my scale product options very well until the scale arrived and was disappointed it was made in Taiwan R.O.C.,when I believed I was supporting a company located in Missouri."
2,Out dated,"It works. I can print from any computer on my network. It does not scan, it does not see the 2nd tray with legal size paper, and it is slow.I am planning an upgrade to a modern networked printer in the near future."
1,JUNK,Head came off the first time I used the hoe. No screw to hold the head on the F/G handle. I now use the F/G handle as a walking staff.
4,Logics shampoo,"I received the product in a timely fashion. It was more expensive than I found later on another site, but it was what I had wanted."
2,Had hopes for this one...,"Unlike the Creme de Corps Honey Body Polish and lotion, this one did not work. It takes a lot of the product to lather up and seeing how Kiehl's can be pricey, I don't want to use too much at a time. I felt like I was not putting anything on my skin. Once used, it does not make my skin softer and I noticed no difference in my skin compared to a drugstore brand. To be fair though, it did not dry my skin out. I will not repurchase this once I'm done with it."
1,"There is no such company in Encino, CA","After I bought some of this and tried it, I don't think there is any or much human pheromone in it, synthetic or otherwise.There are reputable products out there but, I'm returning this one and moving on. Incidentally, I looked for a ""Monarch Laboratories"" in Encino,CA and there is none. There is a Company of that name in LA, but they have no connection, other than they get a lot of complaints from people looking for the imaginary one. That the label doesn't attach well to the bottle is probably a bad sign.I'm glad i didn't pay anywhere near the ""retail"" price for this or I would really be pissed."
1,Beware,"Their shipping chart claims the shipping for items less than $50 is $6.94, but once you get to the end of check-out they actually charge you $11.89."
2,Adorama T- Mount for canon EOS,"I ordered this t-mount thru Amazon. Looking at the picture it said Japan. Ok. When the order arrived it had Taiwan stamped on it!!! No. on the box was #93419 Canon EOS. No red dot, just a small hole drilled in it.So I was able to figure out how to install it, with out the red mark. I tighten it down but was able to turn it conterclockwise and it unscrewed. The locking pin on the camera will not lock in place. The locking pin works just fine with all my Lens. So the hole on the T-Mount from TAIWAN is not installed correct. I thought this kind of thing was my we stoped buying from TAIWAN. VERY UNHAPPY. Now I have to pay to ship it back. And wait until it comes back. Still want know if it will be right one."
1,Like a Box of Chocolates...,... you never know what you're gonna get. I order one and it was great (Bower Brand) and promptly ordered another and it was a different brand and literally fell apart in my hands trying to install it. 2nd one was a total piece of junk. Neither were made in Japan like the picture indicated. Buy somewhere were you know what brand you're getting.
5,I was cheated,"I ordered this t-mount thru Amazon of ADORAMA's ware. Looking at the picture it said: for Canon (AF)Japan. BUt,When the order arrived it had KIPON T-EOS stamped on it! No. on the box was #93419."
2,Not worth it,"I was a big fan of Dan and John and have all of their records as well as both solo records by Dan. I've never warmed up to this record, it seems very phoned in to me, especially coming after ""Stones"""
3,"Good, but not perfect","I must say, I was a little disappointed by this product. (I have now replaced it with a different branded splitter.)There can be a lot of interference emanating from the sockets, and you have to have the earphone plugs about halfway out of the socket in order to hear anything.I bought the splitter to watch movies/listen to music on the train with my girlfriend, but any little bit of movement and the connection totally messes itself up.3 stars because it works - but certainly not 4 or 5 due to the amount of effort required for the aforementioned to happen."
1,"fit loosely, poor quality","poor fitting on the female, splitter ends, not recommended. This thing looks good but that's it, very loose fitting. Radio shack splitter doesn't look as good but works well."
2,Didn't work on iPad 2,On sloped edge of the iPad 2 it would not seat fully resulting in channel crosstalk and distortion. Works great on a flat insert like the iPhone 4. If you are buying to share headphones/earbuds on the iPad 2 I'd hunt for something else.
5,Easy and works great!!,I got this so my girlfriend and I could both listen to a movie on my iPad on a plane. The sound was great in both headphones!
5,MONSTER CABLE,WORKE VERY WEII IT WILL GIVE MY WIFE A CHANSE TO LISTEN TO AUDIOBOOKS AT THE SAME TIME. THE MONSTER CABLE AYICP.ANDY
1,Can't divide sound evenly,I travel often and needed a skitter to watch a movie on my Mac with a friend. My headphones blew out my ears whiles hers - she could only hear low volume.
2,"Sound does go through, but...","It does split the sound, but volume drops (which is fine and expected) and bass is gone, mids are recessed (sounds like music is coming from the other end of the tunnel). Can't hear anything. Don't buy unless you don't care about sound quality at all."
1,Did not fit Kindle Fire HD 8.9 snug,Bought these from Radio Shack the other day to use with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and the male did not fit the kindle snug. It would slip out easily. The sound worked in both headphones but had to return since the splitter was just gonna fall out by the very faintest of wind that blew. Had to write this review to warn others looking to use with the same device.
1,Disappointing ...,"Worst splitter I have ever seen . Does not split the sound, just gives different weird scratchy sounds to headphones. My other splitter which is $1 is much more better than that. May be the one that sent to me is broken, but I threw it to the trash ."
3,Review,"It wasn't as good as I hope it was, there was a problem as one hole had a better quality and the other one wasn't that good."
4,Excellent quality product,"if you want quality at a respectible price in cables and accessories, there is only one name to remember... MONSTER CABLE."
2,Got mine at the dollar store,"They sell these at almost every dollar store, sure the sound quality might not be quite as good, but you're going to have signal loss whatever you hook it up to. These things sell for $1.50 CAN at dollar stores and are worth every penny of THAT price"
2,Dissatisfied,"I was very excited to get this splitter, but when it came and I tried it out on my Ipod touch,My apple headphones didn't properly work, it was a fuzzyish noise and was distorted. My other Sony ones worked fine, although you have to pull then out just a little to sound ok. Don't buy these. It's ironic too because it says that they were made for iPod. Stupid people at monster"
1,Did not do the job on ipad,"I basically bought this product to listen to music music and watch movies on the ipad with my wife when travelling, but it does not work at all.For movies, only part of the audio was clear (the music track and some effects). The voices and most of effects are just muted or heavily distorted.I guess this might not be compatible with modern jacks (three stripes jacks)Of course, I would not recommend this whatsoever.BIG disappointment."
3,Possibly defective.,"My wife and I used this product for traveling during the holidays. I used headphones that I purchased elsewhere and my wife used her Apple headphones. Her headphones only worked completely when we have them slightly pulled out of the female end. We did swap our headphones to see if the problem was with the one side, and that wasn't the issue. Perhaps the one I got was defective somehow?"
1,AWFUL,"Why is it that none of these splitters work?!? I have tried several and they never work when they are fully inserted, this is no different. Dont waste your money on this one. The only reason I gave it one star is because I couldnt leave 0."
3,"Kinda Cheap, but cute.","I bought this, and not long after it fell apart. It's very cute though.. just needs to be better made. It's only glued together very cheaply..."
3,Good moniter but doesnt last,I had the moniter for about three months and was impressed by it. It has excellent dot pitch and brightness. Very good for video games and any other purpose. But right around this time three lines of pixels burnt out. You can only notice them if you screen is solid or semi solid color. It is enough to annoy me at times. I would have to say i was really dispointed by the short longivity of the moniter.
4,Good book - not bashing,"This is an insider's look into the Muslim world. I don't think he bashes the Muslim faith, but it does provide an understanding of their teaching, faith, rules, goals, and beliefs.It was nice to read something that was not second hand knowledge.It is a very quick read."
4,Just set it up,"Delivered today. Took about 5 minutes to put it together, but the base doesn't seem to snap into place as it appears it should, the tabs on the base just set into the slots on the bottom of the monitor. Stable enough, though I might look into the possibility that I need a different base.Great picture. I've seem a couple of reviews on other sites that knock the image....I don't get their complaints. I work with computers all day, and this is easily one of the best images out there for a comparable price.Exactly what I paid for. Reasonable size....great image. I almost went overboard and bought a HUGE CRT.....am glad I came to my senses......now we can afford to put together another new system."
1,Vertical distortion ruins this monitor,"This is the first and last Viewsonic monitor that I will purchase. This monitor was replacing a 19"" Sony that worked fantastic (before being destroyed in my house fire). The Viewsonic P95f+ suffers from major and unadjustable vertical distortion making it worthless for any real graphic work. Even for general text the distortion is annoying. I've tried three graphics cards with the same result. I'm returning this one as defective to the place I purchased it and buying another Sony."
3,would like to choose the color,"Bird cozy seems fine, however, I ended up receiving the one color I hoped I wouldn't ... yellow! I wish they would let you choose the color!"
5,He makes compositing fun!,"I bought this dvd because I wanted to experiment with digital compositing in Shake and After Effects, ""although this particular dvd does not instruct you using After effects you can still benefit from Gary's teaching in any node-based compositing application thankfully that means Fusion, Shake, After Effects, nuke, etc.I recommend this dvd to anyone getting involved in compositing in film or video, very informative."
4,Thought-provoking anthology,"This is a well-edited anthology of essays by a wide variety of Jewish women who for one reason or other chose to cover her hair, according to traditional Jewish practice. (This applies to married women only.) For many, it was a difficult decision; one contributor took on wigs while undergoing cancer treatment, but chose to keep up the practice even after she recovered from her illness. The stories are surprisingly compelling, much more than philosophical musings, and even include one essay by a woman who covered her hair for years but then stopped. As one contributor wrote, ""Covering my hair helps me remember that I am not only about what everyone else can see."" -- Judy Gruen, www.judygruen.com"
2,Finally finished it!!,"I give this title one star for the window into another culture, time and place that it opens and one star for the romance - sure it's all been done before but I'm a [fan]for unattainable priests falling in love with women stuck in doomed marriages!It was a bit annoying that Mei Kwei was so perfect and precious and more beautiful than any woman who has ever roamed the earth, and that all of that is her curse. But that's the way these books work, I suppose!It wasn't a very readable book, I found myself pushing to get it finished so that I could move on to something a bit more devourable.Overall, not a bad read - the descriptions of the characters' surroundings and the characters' emotions are well-crafted, but apart from that, a bit of a drag."
1,Considerable amount of effort put into description.....but..,"Considerable amount of effort put into description.....but...effort not appreciated. Too tedious to read. Simple plot, illogical handling of emotions of charaters"
4,Meet Makimachi Misao,"After leaving a grief striken Kaoru, Kenshin feeling awfuly terrible. As he sits and thinks how everybody must be angry at him for leaving so suddenly, he hears a scream. He observes how a band of men are easily tricked to handing over their money to a 16 year old....sort of. It turns out that she to is headed in the same direction as Kenshin. To Kyoto. It turns out that she's looking for the Oniwaban group, not knowing that all with Aoshi were killed save himself. Kenshin reluctantly gains a traveling partner all the way to Kyoto. These episodes are humor filled unlike the previous episodes, until the last episode on the DVD. Which goes directly into the nity grity. For Rurouni Kenshin fans, this would be a great addition to your collection"
2,What happened???,"After all the drama and great animation from the previous DVD, ""Shadow of the Wolf"", this one was by far... boring. Yes, we meet a new character, Misao, and we finally see Shishio, but the drawings were just plain terrible compared to SOTW and the story was very boring. I was disappointed because I am a huge fan of Rurouni Kenshin. At least the animators should've taken their time instead of rushing their artwork. I'm still hopeful that the next ones will be better."
2,Certainly not what I expected.,"Pitifully low resolution for the vast majority of the designs, and the high(er) res images were poorly scanned copies.This is not what I've come to expect from Dover.Did not include many well-known kamon."
2,Clipart without a cause,"Nice collection of clipart, but no associated names, sort of like a collection of Scottish Tartans with no clan names"
3,this book is okay...,Book arrived fast. The book was helpful but I wish the quality of the images were a little better.
1,"Poor Connie, Get A Voice","Oh my, this cd package is awful. It consists of re-records so awful as to sound like parodies. Miss Francis' performances are as stiff as a board and she sings as though under hypnosis. Truthfully, we all have better things to do than listen to Connie croak out old ditties like Stupid Cupid. Get the original Greatest Hits instead."
4,New studio recordings of Miss Francis' greatest songs.,"Don't be fooled by this one.... this cd is original in the fact that these recordings are from a recent visit to the studio. The Francis voice and charm is still there, and as strong and poignant as ever. Be sure to pay close attention to her versions of ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?,"" ""Hurt,"" ""Torn Between Two Lovers,"" ""Cry,"" and ""Misty Blue."" Miss Francis' versatility shines in this cd as you'll hear her perform ballads, country, and a little country/rock (""Ol' Time Rock & Roll""), too. This cd is meant for any Connie Francis collection."
1,LOOK ELSEWHERE,"PRODUCT NOT AS ADVERTISED. THE AT&T STYLE PLUG IS CHEAP AND NOT PROPERLY MADE TO MATE WITH A STANDARD AT&T PLUG, SO THE PRODUCT IS TOTALLY USELESS. LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR THESE SORT OF PRODUCTS. I AM STILL BATTLING AMAZON AND THE PROVIDER OF THIS PRODUCT FOR A REFUND. LAST TIME I BUY ANYTHING FROM AMAZON.COM."
1,what a let down,"It looked so nice in the picture and being wood, made it seem even nicer. It has never worked right. The clamp/grabber part can't hold onto anything so my son cannot collect any object, no matter how light, with the crane and lift it around. Also, the crane came in 3 sections which were very easy to assemble, but never stays together either. After reassembling it over an over again, I finally duct taped it so it would stay together. So this crane doesn't pick up anything, nor does it stay together."
1,Disappointing,"All my son wanted for Christmas was a crane. Unfortunately ""Santa"" picked this one. It comes in three parts and they will not stay together. We've even tried wood glue on it with no success. I expected more from a toy that cost so much. I am writing this review 7 months after Christmas, but it fell apart within the first month. I wish I had written to the company that makes it right away."
2,"Looks cool, but very unsturdy & unstable","We received this as a gift for our four-year-old for Christmas. It looks great and my son loved the idea of it. Within the first hour of having it set up, it was bumped by a rubber ball and the pegs that hold it together pulled out of the wood. We can push the toy back together, but it is very unstable. We are extremely disapointed in the quality of this product -- especially for the price paid."
3,Fun but not sturdy,This is a fun crane although it often tips over and wobbles even though it is on a flat surface. Also it is a bit expensive for what you get with it.
2,"Good quality, but doesn't seem very interesting","We bought this for our sons for christmas when we discovered he loved to use the cranes at the park. We thought this would be a great choice because he could use it to move about his cars, etc.Turned out not to be what we expected. Though it appears this product is made with great quality, it doesn't hold onto things very well. We don't have any of the other Plan Toys sets so we found it to be a little dissapointing.I think if you're looking for a good toy to teach someone to use their fine-motor skills, and you sit with the child and work with it, this crane would be a great tool. However, in our situation, our son is not lacking in these skills and it didn't hold his attention for very long."
2,It would be fun if it was more sturdy,"The crane was costly, but it never worked. It has never stayed together, so it can't be played with. The Plan City garage and road set were great, so I thought this would be a quality product, but it is not."
4,Great Toy for Crane-Loving Kid,"My son received this crane for Christmas and it has been a big hit. The assembly was easy, and it has been a popular play thing since he opened the package. Unlike other reviewers, we have not had any problems with the crane tipping over or falling apart. The assembly was easy and the screws hold everything in place securely. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the elevator bucket on the outside of the crane doesn't have a ""stop"" position. Otherwise, this is a great toy for the parent who likes simple, creative things for their kids."
2,disappointing,Broke quickly - not repairable with wood glue. Beautiful looking and nice concept but definitely not durable.
3,"Fun, if the pieces stay together","We are in love with the plan city toys, and this one seems durable at first, but the pieces now pop apart constantly. You have to assemble it when it comes (just 3 pieces) and that is how it comes apart, into those same pieces. Up until now I just popped them back together, no problem, but now some of the little black screws are broken, so it happens constantly. I think the pieces can be glued and it will be fine, but not the quality I have come to expect. We have NEVER had any problem with the crane mechanism itself, and that part is really fun."
2,A notch above Ed Wood...,"but not in a good way. These films were outdated the day they were made, let alone today. Yes, they have an unintentional laughable side, but definitely not in the ""so bad it's good"" category. The acting gives new meaning to ""wooden,"" and the plots are so thin you can read through them. The bad song in the diner in ""Strangler"" was a high point, as well as the manic (among other things) brother."
4,Delightfully Moody,I first saw this on a local PBS station and loved it. The way it is filmed enhances the storyline and creates an almost dreamlike experience. Note that Rita Hayworth and Glen Ford are NOT in this film; I don't know why Amazon insists on listing them as primary actors to the exclusion of all those who are primary.
4,"Solid performance, poorly filmed","This is a 55 minute concert of a flamenco performance in Los Angeles. The music, from a dozen musicians, is first class, and the dancing is solid and sometimes flashy. The show is designed, in some way, to reflect the old movie ""Gilda,"" starring Rita Hayworth. The flamenco film is worth the money, especially because of the music. But someone decided to make it ""arty,"" and throughout the 55 minutes there are fades into ""old movie"" format and some slow motion shots, both of which are likely to rob you of your eyesight. Does not the director know that anyone can buy a DVD of Gilda on which the movie looks brand new? In any case, the filming seriously detracts from what was a fine performance."
2,"A Simple Misprint, Surely",The sample image of the poster clearly shows that the symbols for crescendo and decrescendo are reversed. Could create a bit of confusion in your class!
2,Frog Pin,"Got this for my sister who collects frogs. The pin part broke the first time she tried to pin it on her jacket. I felt bad, she uses it as a little shotski in her display case. Not made well. But cute."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"Do not purchase this product! I just received mine and right out of the box it does not work. It not only won't rewind the tapes, but it also eats the tape.Save your money. I spoke to JVC, manufacturer of my camcorder and they told me that the rewinding mechanism in the camcorders last a long time. No need to purchase an external rewinding device. There's a reason that the major camcorder companies don't make these items. They're not necessary!"
2,Tape Jam,"This product sometimes jams the tape. Like after you insert the tape in the rewinder, the lid won't open back up, and the tape is stuck somehow. I had to take apart the product in order to retrieve my tape."
4,Well done on a budget!,"I have watched this one several times now. In this particular genre it is easy to just do yet another blood spattered gorefest. The Director did phenomenally well on a short budget. The special effects were as close to believable as you will ever see in a film like this. There are a few places where continuity is a tad thin (look for the electrical box on the side of a building) but overall this film is worth watching several times, and is worthy of addition to your collection."
3,TALKING ZOMBIES,"The movie works the Esau/Jacob theme as twins struggle against each other. One wears a furry coat like Esau. They struggle in the womb to be the first born. The brothers create an army of hungry ""zombies"" to fight and kill each other. The setting is supposed to be Western North Carolina 1872, but that must have been added as the the dialouge would have you believe they are out west.A new preacher comes to town, who has strong sexual urges (males, females, horses). The sheriff had killed the old one, Harry Barry. The sheriff also keeps his step-son in jail. The twins create zombies by giving the people an elixir that makes them the living dead. Some zombies can run, others do a foot drag. Some can talk and reason, other are silent. If you note, there is a rebel flag behind the bar. There is also an America flag. Looks like it is the 50 star variety.No nudity unless you count a fake rubber breast covered with blood."
3,Western zombies and guts galore!,"The latest from Long Time Horror Distributor Brain Damage films, Fistful of brains puts a long anticipated twist on the Zombie Genre, That's right Fistful is the first full-legnth zombie western & winner of two film festivals, The film is a fun ride, great special f/x good and gory with cool sets and great atmosphere, fistful of brains takes us on a gut wrenching journey about the elixir of life making its way for sale in a small town for 25 cents a bottle problem is the people who live forever are dead, check this one out you wont regret it ."
3,Not as sour as they used to be.,"These gumballs, back in the day when they were marketed as ""Tear Jerkers,"" were really sour. They lived up to their name, in spades. After looking all over the Internet for them, I got the message that they were now called ""Cry Baby"" instead, so I very happily plunked my money down, looking forward to the eye-wincing sourness that made the old ""Tear Jerkers"" so magnificent. But these seem sweet rather than sour; the sourness lasts only for a moment or two and it is not the wonderful bone-shaking, salivary-gland-aching, grapefruit-in-the-eye-squinting sourness that I remembered. So, yeah, they're good. They're just not great. I miss ""Tear Jerkers"". :`("
3,Toned-down version of a classic,"I am a lover of bold flavors, especially spicy and sour. I was psyched to find a few Tear Jerkers gumballs, individually wrapped, in mixed bags of candy we were handing out to kids in a parade this weekend. I tried all three ""flavors"" that I found in the bag (red, green, and blue), and found all of them to be disappointing when held up against my memories of being able to barely tolerate them when I was in high school.They are sour, but not ""lock your jaw up"" sour like they used to be. I remember them almost rivaling the sour power of Warheads... and while I still find Warheads to be ridiculous for the first few seconds, these gumballs just don't compare to the ones I remember. Good, not great.The only caveat I would add is that it was not ""Cry Baby"" gumballs, but ""Tear Jerkers Sour Bubble Gum"" printed on the wrappers. They're both manufactured by Tootsie Roll Industries, so they're pretty likely to be the same thing, but I haven't done a side-by-side comparison."
3,Great Monitor Until end of Warranty,"This is a great monitor, great picture, great text, however the only complaint I have is that it started having trouble right after the warranty ran out."
5,WIFE GIFT AND SHE LOVED IT.,GREAT GIFT AS MY WIFE LOVES MADELINE HUNTER BOOKS. SHIPPING WAS FAST AND WELL APPRECIATED. THANK YOU. 1 2 3
4,Daniel St. John - An Unforgettable Hero,"Daniel St. John was nearly perfect, but he was a difficult man to get to know at first. But he revealed much about himself all those times he gazed out the window. Diane was a fine character but it was a bit disturbing that at age twenty she was dressed like a young teen, no matter the reason. I don't feel that we got to know her very well, though. She didn't seem like she had much going for her, and she was definitely ignorant about real life. In fact, the only time she showed competence was while she was fishing. (...)"
5,This book deserves 10 stars,"I must say this book is the best in the series. Love the development and mystery surrounding the hero/ heroine. Some of the lines carry such great meanings about love. Beautifully written, I can't get enough. I wish she would write more like this!!"
4,The Seducer,"I was captivated by the characters in all of Madeline Hunter's books; The Seducer, The Saint, The Charmer and The Sinner. All are a must read. In the Seducer, Daniel St. John has been Diane Albret's guardian for 10 years. He placed her in a school in France and visited her once a year. She has named him The Devil Man. He finally removes her from the school when he realizes that she is 20 years old. As the story unfolds a mystery evolves, along with a growing love for each other. Romance, mystery and seduction. A very good story. Please, read all of the books."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to Madeline Hunter's new series, but I was disappointed with this first installment. Neither the hero nor heroine of this novel were likeable and the revenge back story didn't keep my interest. Diane's character is supposed to be young and sheltered, but I found her to be way too stupid and passive to be believable. Her complete dependence on Daniel also made their romance distasteful. Even though I was disappointed with the Seducer I found the excerpts of her next two books to be amusing so I will probably still buy her next novel given that I liked Hunter's earlier books."
1,predictable,"I found the book a bit boring and very predictable. Having read another of the author's books I expected it to be more entertaining. Unfortunately, like most romance novels, this book is just a quick write up to cash in on the author's previous good work!"
5,The winner,"I've had this book on my TBR shelf for years. I was put off by some disappointments in other books by Ms Hunter and some very negative reviews here.I am glad my cuoriosity got the better of me. I liked this book a lot. I thought Diane was darling and Daniel was the perfect hero. The historical detail kept my interest.The book was mistitled. This was a story of love, betrayal, vengence and redemption. It really worked for me and has restored my faith in Madeline Hunter. Well Done."
3,"Heroine was a bit weak, but improves at the end","I totally didn't like the first half of the novel - I don't object to the guardian/ward setup but in this case he was authoritarian, uncommunicative, unfeeling, didn't seem to care about her wishes and was using her as a pawn in his game of revenge. She sort of went along with it, although she was trying to find her family but it seemed a bit half hearted. Kind of reminded me of reading Barbara Cartland in high school (but...thank...god...there...were...no...pauses...). It did improve after a while, she shows more independence and runs away; he realizes his feelings for her. I thought Hunter's 'The Saint' was much better."
2,disappointing :(,"I was looking forward to reading this book, first in a series. Sadly, I gave up on it about 100 pages in. I felt there was so MUCH mundane writing and hardly any dialog between not only the two main characters but between any characters at all. It just feels completely unemotional and without any sort of feeling-there is NOTHING exciting about this book. The heroine is naive, and not in a good way. I hope the others in this series are better. 1.5 stars."
4,Coons,"I loved the book Coons; it had everything in it. It has adventure, love, and suspense. The book incorporates all these things with ease. I liked the true adventures that were in the book, I saw things from my own childhood in the book. It was very enjoyable."
1,"Nothing ""Professional"" about it.","I've just received my third defective monitor from Viewsonic. The first monitor suffered from uncorrectable vertical distoration, bent vertical grid wires, and uneven brightness. The second monitored started failing after four months of use. The new monitor has uneven brightness where half the monitor is darker than the other half. Viewsonic has lost me as a customer. The shipping cost to return them is starting to add up."
2,Gone in 6 months,"Bought the monitor in January, good brightness, color and clarity. Faded to black in June - returned for repair...."
2,Great color but blurry image,I purchased two of these to use as dual monitors. I thought the first one was defective as text on the left side of the screen was blurry. I called Viewsonic and they said it was defective. I tried the second monitor with the same result. Not defective; this is the way it is! I wouldn't recommend this monitor because of this. I've had better luck with NEC.
5,"Must-have, especially for students","This book is a great overview of the intricacies of living in a new place. Helping this ""foreigner"" (from NY) use public transit, buy groceries, navigate the city, and even purchase liquor, this book was a huge help for a new computer science grad student at the University of Pittsburgh, but the audience is realistically far wider. Yes, it has the biases expected of a book written by computer science grad students (at carnegie mellon, to be exact), but that doesn't mean its advice isn't relevant to any new student, or really any new Pittsburgher.Recommended to me by my advisor, this book has become a ""must-have"" in my opinion, for coming to spend any amount of time in Pittsburgh."
1,Missing Product,"Abebooks advertised a set of 4 board books (see title above of item listed), yet I was only mailed one of four books. I've attempted to contact Abebooks via e-mail and only get automated responses that I cannot reply to! I will never do business with this company again, and warn anyone who is considering a purchase of used books from them!"
2,Disappointing,This book in Kindle format is disappointing. Each exercise is followed by 2-3 totally blank pages. There are no written directions to accompany the pictures! I am reading on an iPhone. Is there a way to fix this? Very disappointing.
5,A must have for every home,"This book is amazing in my opinion. I think that the information in this book could help many to avoid long term pain and injury if applied. The information is basic and the exercises easy to perform. The directions for each excercise thought out and easy to understand with pictures that add to the understanding. I would recommend this version over the trade paperback, it is worth the additional cost."
3,Pain relief.,"I found that this book did not have anything new it it. The other books that I have, had most of the itms in this book. It may be an okay item for someone who has none.It was received quickly. Well packaged and in good shape."
2,ridiculous that it has NO INDEX,"Will say again - no index gives me the impression that book was put together rapidly without much thought as functionality - Yes it has a good table of contents that divides things up by parts of the body - knees, feet, hips, etc. but as someone else said in these reviews, he didn't expect to find plantar fasciitis in the ankle section. Thanks for his review since that is one of the main reasons I purchased the book - now I don't have to read a lot of information not pertinent to get to what I'm most interested in (I just have to read the reviews on Amazon, LOL).Note to the author - some people are very very busy. Without an index, you just set it up so that only people who don't have day jobs or people who are absolutely desperate will get to the information they need. I would have rather had a sloppy index than none at all. There is software that will create an index for you causing you to need to do a review only of the list it provides."
1,Don't Buy,"People who are looking for back pain relief have already been to a doctor, or searched the internet for exercises for relief. So, why buy a book that repeats this??!!"
4,Too high! Dimensions are misleading!,"The dimensions say 16x15x15. After assembly, it seemed a bit high to me so I measured it. It is 21.5"" high from the top of the stool to the floor. This was measured at the LOWEST setting.Yes, I checked, and rechecked all the wingnuts and joints to make sure I assembled it correctly. Took it apart, reassembled it.I don't know why they made this stool so high. I am 5'10"" and at the lowest setting, it is right on the verge of being too high for me.Aside from height issues, it is a very high-quality stool and very comfortable."
2,Not for the chubby user!,"If you are a large person, buy something else. My 85 pound step son likes this. I bought it as a piano stool and would have returned it if he hadn't asked for it.I see everyone else seems to like it so, it must be me. I found that no matter how locked down it was, it wiggled beneath me."
3,Only Ok,"From the reviews I had read of this product I was expecting something a little more substantial. What you get is somehow less than the sum of its parts.The Good:Base is very sturdyLooks pleasant enough and the height adjusts to a comfortable level.The Bad:The seat keeps coming off for me, it seems the screw part that is supposed to hold it in place keeps loosening.The seat itself feels like it is not very secure.The height adjustment is not pneumatic, not a big deal breaker if you only use it for drums and keep it at the same height, but if you intend on using it for anything else you have to manually adjust every time."
3,kinda ok... but,"i bought this eat along with the rest of my swingstar kit...for $400... i like it in the fact that it gets the jon done, but it squeaks, hard to move, and the tightener doesn't work...i almost broke my leg at a gig when i trid lifting it and it fell...i good for RB and GH, but its crap for anything else"
4,"Not for long sessions, but serves its purpose","I got this for playing pro drums on Rock Band 3. The throne looks nice and is adjustable. The only issues I have with it is that the top tightening screw comes loose, so I have to frequently tighten it back down. Perhaps some lock-tight will work great. Other than that it is comfortable and adjusts to fit just about any height but need to take a break every few hours to rest my back and bottom."
4,Great for the Price,"Not the heaviest or sturdiest throne, but it's well built for the price and does jsut fine. I'm a big dude (6'5"", built like a linebacker) and it holds me well enough. I'm not going to jump on the thing, but it works. And again, it's a very affordable throne. Cushioning is fine. I tend to get sick of sitting in it after about an hour, but no complaints."
5,Sturdy and Comfortable!,"I purchased this drum throne for my sweetheart so it will be more comfortable for him to play the drums on Rock Band. He said it works great, and it is very comfortable and sturdy. He loved the height adjustment and said it was a very high quality product."
4,RockBand Throne,"I got this as a Golden Box item to replace my cheap throne for Rock Band. This is definitely sturdy. I don't have the loose, rocking problem with the seat of my old throne. The rubber feet keep it in place. The padding on the seat could be thicker, but not a problem unless you have 1+hr long drumming sessions (like me). Also, the seat doesn't swivel very much. Which might be good or bad (depending on your style of drumming). All in all worth the extra $$."
5,A triumphant return to Greece for Nana Mouskouri,"This video captures the magic and splendour of Nana Mouskouri's first concert in Greece for over 20 years. She sings a wide range of material in a variety of languages. From old favorites through to new material at the time, Nana gives a faultless performance. The electricity felt in the crowd is felt by the viewer, a fantastic concert video, highly recommended to all."
3,Cute Romance,"Natalie Dorsett is a long-term tenant in a Louisville boarding home and, when Jack Miller moves in, he shakes up her life. Jack is a sexy, but suspicious character who may (or may not) be connected to the Mob, and Natalie and her busybody landlady spend their days and nights conjecturing about Jack's life. I won't ruin the surprise, but suffice to say that Natalie and Jack find a way to romance one another despite his career choice. The book was fun, and funny, and made me laugh out loud quite a lot. The only drawback was that Natalie was a lot more interested in Jack than he was in her; the story started to get too much desperate-girl-chasing-guy for my tastes but was cute to read anyway."
5,Dishes you will repeatedly make!,This recipe book is full of so many dinner foods your family will ask for for years!
3,450 recipes - only 200 if you don't cook with alcohol,"None of the other reviews have mentioned that at least half of the recipes use wine or beer as one of the ingredients. If you like cooking with alcohol, it's a great cookbook. If you don't cook with alcohol, there are still over 200 very yummy recipes for you to try."
4,Thank goodness........,".......there is finally another low-carb cookbook on the market! After cruising the bookstores and finding very little but low-fat (read: high-carb) cookbooks, it's great to finally have another resource. My very critical husband has loved every recipe I've made from this book. The Cheesy Baked Salmon (or haddock, or whatever) is awesome! My only criticism is the lack of accurate carb counts. Those who are just starting the diet need to know just how many carbs are in a serving, not just ""Low = 10 grams or less"" or ""Very Low = 5 grams or less."" Of course, anyone with the time and a copy of Corinne Netzer's ""Complete Book of Food Counts"" could figure it out, but it would be nice to have the information for each recipe already there."
4,Fun & Silly Anime,"This anime is very strange and silly. :) If you like that kind of thing, it is perfect. Everything is very... exaggerated. I wish there were more episodes to develop the plot. There are only two episodes available."
3,Elf Princess Rane,I realy like this anime it follow the same fomular as excel saga and that is having 100 or more things happening at once and super deformed boddies only thing I dislike about this show was there's only 2 ep's maybe the people who made it will one day make more fingers cross
2,Not all its cracked up to be,I found this story very boring and its characters annoying. Everyone screams and runs around like rabid chickens. I suggest if you want to see it rent it or buy it when it is on sale for a dollar. Not worth twenty bucks I assure you.
5,"My first, and still favorite, anime","When I bought this video, I was really excited. It was the first anime video I was going to own, and I was pumped. When I got home, I was not dissapointed! It was hilariously funny, especially the character who babbles words that are a combination of Japanese movie directors, American cartoons, and french. A hilarious must see for all anime owners! But be warned, IT IS BIZZARE!"
5,funny,Elf princess rane is an exellent comedy which will have you choking on laughter. Take Go Takarada for instance- a reckless adventurer who constantly falls from high places Leen- The foul mouthed rival elf bent on killing Rane that b**** Mari- A sweet innocent.... never mind. Go's sisters- all identical but all so different The insanity of this anime will make you forget the storyline and watch the antics of the numerous odd charcters. The art may look like any other high grade fantasy anime but it's unique. and wonderfull
2,Don't buy this if you use XP or newer.,"I bought this for my IBM ThinkPad T40 with Windows XP, and it barely works. Whenever it detects the hardware it makes my computer get the BSOD and restart, it sometimes doesn't do this, but that almost never happens, the only good things I can say about this is that the Signal strength is good and its pretty fast."
5,Groovy and fun,"Both my 2-year-old and 5-year-old have loved this toy for at least the last year. It probably helps that I'll get up and dance when they play certain songs, which adds to their entertainment! I'm just so happy that it doesn't come with lots of tiny parts, and that it's easy for them to carry around, and that it teaches things like the days of the week in such a catchy way."
5,I can finally cook!,"My 17-month-old son is so well entertained by this toy that I can finally cook again! It has 15 songs, so at there is some variety. I like that it teaches letters and numbers, so he is learning something (not just mindless entertainment). The sound quality is just fine, and the volume is good. No complaints!"
5,Lots of Fun for All,"I purchased this toy for my 15 month old. It was a big hit for all my children especially my 3 year old and 15 month old. They love to listen to the songs and watch the letters pop up on the screen. It plays several children songs like ABC, Old MacDonald, Take Me Out to the Ballgame...They are all singing along with it. I recommend this toy to all families with small children who love music."
5,my daughter's favorite,My 14 month old daughter LOVES this toy. she quickly learned to press the buttons and plays it all the time. it's my new favorite gift. leapfrog makes the best stuff. her other faves are the leapfrog table and some older leapfrog stuff they discontinued like the cube. highly recommend this toy!!
5,My Son's All Time Favorite Toy!!,"My son first received this toy as a Christmas present when he was 1 year old. He's 4 and he still loves playing with it from time to time! It's always been his favorite toy! We bought this one as a replacement for the original one he received that was lost. It's educational, fun, durable, and colorful. You can't go wrong with this purchase! The product arrived promptly as described by the seller. Overall it was a great experience!"
5,My 2 year old loves this!,"I purchased this for my 2 yr old daughters birthday. She loves it, plays with it all the time. She sings the songs and dances. This product is very durable also - it has been dropped on the hard floor many times. I would definitely recommend this for any 2 yr old!"
5,Great Christmas Gift for my Two Year Old,"Once we figured out how to get the tag out to get the demo off it was great, the tag had broken off and we had no idea it was in there. If your product does not sing the whole song you need to remove the tag on the back. Customer Service was no help at all, but once we got it working, it is great! My daughter loves it!"
5,The best gift for a first birthday!,"We have given this gift several times for first birthday parties. We received it as a present for one of our sons ... and it is still a hit almost two years later. This is a toy that will keep kids occupied in the kitchen or anywhere else! The sounds, the lights, the songs, the buttons ... it is a toddler's dream!"
4,Grandmom's opinion,I purchased this for my grandson for Christmas when he was 14 months old. He still pushes the buttons occasionally. It may become of interest again when he begins to learn letter recognition.
4,my 2 year old loves it,"Once I was able to get her to understand to not take it off of the fridge, which didn't take long, this has been a fun toy. Even though she likes magnets that are smaller that she can put on and take off of the fridge, I, as a parent, love this toy because I am not having to pick it up of the floor constantly like some of the other magnetic alphabets."
5,He Loves It!!,"I bought this for my 18 month old great-nephew for Christmas, and he loves it!! He likes to carry it around with him, and he also likes putting it on the fridge. It keeps him occupied when my niece is trying to cook dinner or clean up in the kitchen. The songs are cute and he likes the flashing lights. I think it's a great little toy!"
4,My little guy loves it!,"My son is 12 months old and just loves this radio! He carries it around with him and then when he is done playing, he puts it back on the fridge. He cannot turn the knob to ""change"" the stations, but he can press the play button to hear different songs."
2,Repeats Letters in the Alphabet Song,"I bought this product for my son and am truly disappointed in its performance. I have exchanged it twice now and am still having the same problem. The first one repeated the letter ""J"" in the Alphabet Song and skipped the letter ""K"". So, I exchanged it and the second one did the same thing only it was with 2 other letters. I then called LF and after returning the second one directly to them (I had to pay for shipping), they sent me a new one that is doing the same thing again. This one is also with the letter ""J"". I don't want my son to play with it as he will only end up learning the alphabet the wrong way. LF has not been helpful at all and I just intend to get my money back. I have other LF fridge products that work great but this fridge DJ does not."
1,$43.48!????? Why the price hike Amazon!?,Nothing wrong with the toy...great toy but PRICE???I did have this toy in my son's Xmas wish list for family to use as reference....it has gone from less than $20 to $43.48????? Does it actually come with a real life DJ now?? I would LOVE to know why Amazon has become the MORE expensive place to buy things as this is only one of many price hikes I've seen lately? I will be buying this from the actual LeapFrog site - it is less than $15 there.
4,"A great toy, my kids love it.","This is the second time we have bought this toy. Our elder daughter loved it and picked up pretty much all the songs before she turned 2. It broke during a trip we took, but we had already used it for over a year. We bought the second one when our younger daughter turned 1 and she loves this toy too. Our elder daughter still plays with this toy. The only complaint I have is that the toy does not look like the picture. We probably got the older model. Nonetheless, we love this toy and I would highly recommend it."
4,Lets kids enjoy music,"This was bought for an 18-month-old who loves to dance every time he hears music. He really loves it. His older brother, 3 1/2 yrs, thinks it's lots of fun too. Their mom likes that it stays on the refrigerator rather than the floor and the boys have something to distract them while waiting for meals."
4,fun toy,"My 14 month daughter really likes playing with this, and on Christmas morning it was one of her favorites. I like the volume controll. This item is too heavy for the magnets on it and really does not stay up on a metal (fridge) surface other than that it has been a hit."
2,Took over 2 years to find second demo pull tab. T,"My husband swore up and down that there was no demo for this toy, that it was just a dumb toy! It has been driving me nuts since my almost 4 year old got it for his 2nd birthday. I looked online, and saw that there is a plastic oval clear thing in the back. The demo mode was frustrating because my son missed half the alphabet and half his numbers, and the songs just changed constantly. I wonder if it had any effect on his brain really. I know it drove me nuts!"
2,Quite boring,"My 19-mth old son received this as a gift for Xmas. At first sight, he loved it. He could hardly wait for me to get it out of the box. But after 10 mins of play, he tossed it to the side & hasn't touched it since! I've tried to play with it in front of him to get his attention, but it didn't work. I'm really disappointed, b/c he loves the other products (Fridge Animals & Fridge Alphabet) & was excited about it from the reviews.If you want to get this toy for your child, I'd definately check it out at the store or play with someone else's first."
5,Happy Grandkids,This was recommended to me by a mom with 3 toddlers. I bought it for my grandkids to enjoy when they visit...they love it.
2,"Does Not Play Full Songs, I've Tried Everything!...","Thank goodness this was a gift because I'd be very annoyed at having paid for this. Before I started this review, I checked to see if other people had my problem, a few did, and some said you need to pull the tab in the back or change the batteries. I've done those things, it STILL will not play an entire song. Every song fades away after about 5 seconds. It's a shame cause my son (1 old) loves this thing. We've had it about 6 months, but he's just recently started carrying it all over the place. The major downside is he has to continuously press the button to get the songs to play since they fade away so quickly. I've checked the back thinking maybe there was a switch that said 'Demo-mode', or maybe a tab that I missed...nope. Maybe I just got a lemon, which is a bummer since he seems to like it, but I just can not give this toy a good rating based on my experience with it."
3,It's okay,"Enjoy the songs, they aren't annoying. The color dots *help hold attention, but this toy isn't fun for very long. I think the longest my son has played with it at once is 7 minutes."
1,Did I get a dud?,"I just purchased this toy for my grandson. As I was trying it out I have found that it only goes up to 5 on the numbers, and ""f"" on the abc song. The music songs only play for about 5 seconds and then fades out. Is this the way this is supposed to work or did I get a dud? Please help so I know whether to send it back or not."
2,Not Typical Leapfrog Quality,"I saw the reviews and intended to buy two of them as gifts, incl. one for my near 2yo son. He loved playing with it at the store. But I was surprised that it looked like a cheap toy, not what I'd expect from Leapfrog (the online pic is much more slick looking). With that added to the poor quality sound, I just didn't think it would make a good gift and I couldn't justify the purchase for my son. Too bad because it's a great idea."
4,Educational - yes ... Expensive - yes,"I bought this for my 3 y/o son & he enjoys playing with it on the fridge, along with all the other Leap Frog refrigerator learning games... Only real downfall is the price..."
4,songs are longer after removed from packaging,"I bought this toy for my 18 month old son for Christmas. While the toy was still in the box my husband was disappointed because it only played seconds of songs. After we got the toy out of the packaging we realized that it did play the whole song. So much so that I sometimes wonder when it will stop playing! My son enjoys this toys and plays with it while I am in the kitchen. He really enjoys all of the songs and dances to them. I like it because it can stay on the fridge out of the way, it gives him something to do while I'm cooking and he is learning sounds, letters and numbers. My main point for this review is don't judge the length of the songs until you get it out of the packaging. They are much longer then the couple of seconds you here while in the packaging."
3,Another Electronic Toy,Gave this to my two grand daughters who are 16 and 18 months. Both treated it as just another electronic toy. Carried it around a bit and then went to toys that require imagination. There are just too many toys that do things for a child and make noise.
4,"cute, fun, versatile","this toy is great for kids who like to follow mom into the kitchen...it can go on the fridge to keep him/her entertained, or detach easily so he/she can carry it around. it is a bit smaller than it looks in the picture, but the size is fine for little ones to carry around."
5,"Beautiful, delicate, looks very very expensive",We bought this for our daughter for her 8th birthday. She asked for a real pearl necklace. The chain is delicate and the pearl is gorgeous. Looks very expensive.
2,Lock does not hold,"I found the mount loose on the camera end. . It holds ok but the lock does not. Has the potential of falling off of the camera. attempted to adjust the lens and the mount rotated in the camera. Tried other lenses, they held fine."
1,I DIDN'T TAKE TIPS,"This could be seen as the African-American version of ""The Girlfriend Experience"". A call girl relates stories of her kinky clients to her psychoanalyst and tries to juggle her career with her home life with a husband who yells at her for missing PTA meetings.The dialouge, script, acting, directing, and editing are below a college 101 project. Characters are thrown at you. At one point our call girl said she didn't accept tips and only accepted what she charged. Apparently the writer knows nothing about the escort service where everything is a tip. I was reluctant to write a review out of embarrassment of having to admit I watched this film.F-bombs, sex, no nudity."
2,Horrible,"Horrible movie. Bad Acting, low budget, story sucks!! Stay away!! Don t waste your money!!!!"
2,Yuck,This is a disgrace to the film industry. Because I know I can never get back the time I wasted watching this I can only warn anyone who is contemplating viewing this to watch paint dry instead...it would be much more entertaining that this so called movie.
2,Was just ok,This movie was nothing special. I am a fan of many of the actors and that is why I brought it. The script left something to be desired.
2,Very Low Budget,"I wanted to turn this movie off within the first ten minutes, and I should have. The movie is stupid. 30 minutes into it, you put the bad acting behind you only to realize that the editing of the movie is poor. At one point, I even heard the floor creaking as the actress walked and performed her lines. I'm sure that wasn't supposed to make the final cut. The ending was just completely ridiculous and a waste. Like a previous post says, you start seeing the credit and immediately wonder why.Don't buy this movie, and only rent it with a free coupon (like I did) if you can't find anything else in the store.I can't believe Tamala Jones, Bokeem Woodbine, and Lynn Whitfield would associate themselves with this crappy straight to video movie.Lynn Whitfield has fallen hard from A Thin Line Between Love and Hate. And I pray that Tamala Jones hasn't type cast herself as a cheap hoe. She definitely won't be winning any awards for this role."
1,ughh,"Hated it"" If your confused you'll love this film.Sane people don't bother you'll probably barf. I only gave it one star because I couldn't give it 0 stars. Tamala Jones and Lynn Whitfield must be going broke to stoop to such low levels. Am I thee only one that thought Lynn and Tamala would end up in bed together?"
2,Troubles,"This remote out of the box controlled my Sony DVD player. It did not however, control my Sony receiver. Nor could I program it to do so (yes, tried the Sony codes, and tries learning the code). I also couldn't get it to control my Scientific Atlanta cable box. I also couldn't get it to control my RCA VCR. I could get it to turn on/off my Phillips TV but it wouldn't do anything else (channels, volume, etc). There's no LED on this remote to let you know when you're doing anything which is also annoying. I guess you get what you pay for, but it would be nice if it at least worked."
2,won't control my SONY receiver,"I lost the remote to my receiver, thinking this was a Sony remote, it has to work right? WRONG! Works great with everything else though. Thought maybe the problem was my receiver, but apparently someone else had the same problem with their Sony receiver as well."
1,Bad Programming,It worked fine with the Sony TV and DVD. It could not be programmed to work with the Toshiba VCR or the RCA DirectTV satelite receiver. The entire point was to find a remote that would get them all to work. I already have the Sony TV remote that could handle the DVD and TV.Very Disappointing!Their support number just had an automated system which did not address this problem. Most of the options said you need to change batteries or turn on the device.Not helpful at all.
1,Annoying remote,"It worked for my Pioneer Receiver and my Panasonic 5 disk DVD changer (but I couldn't change disks).It did NOT work for my Sylvania TV or my JVC VCR at all.Also, the buttons on the remote are very mushy and there is no indication that you are actually pressing any buttons (like a light or a click noise). All in all: not a good remote.I will say this for it, it is more ergonomically friendly than most of the remotes that came with my systems.So back to the store it goes."
4,great clip-on visor,"This is a great visor for everyday use! I've been looking for a ""clip on"" style for a while now and they usually they come in outrageous sizes but this one is just perfect. I find that clip on's are a bit more comfortable to wear and it won't ruin your hairstyle if you choose to wear it down. The straw design is also nice since it gives it a more youthful and modern feel. The product review is accurate in which the visor did not budge at all even while I was running- so yes- you CAN exercise in it. I give it a thumbs up =)"
5,nice alternative,I pray the rosary every day and lead it in church on Saturdays. I'm always on the lookout for meditations geared to a specific intention. We often forget about the souls in purgatory and this is a nice way to remember them.
2,Surprised by high rating for this book,"I was surprised by the number of people giving 5 stars to this book. Then I noticed that most of them dated 2004.I am a builder and stood with this book for 15 minutes in a book store and that was enough. It seems to be a rehash of information from various sources, even free Federal resources, but lacked a comprehensive approach; mixing ""green"" any way the authors wanted.This is a problem with the industry where 'green"" is mixed with energy efficient is mixed with minimalism etc.The book never was good for a construction practitioner and now it's ideas are way way out of date even for a home owner."
4,Great way to think about green remodelling,"This book really shaped how I went about renovating my house. Although I wasn't able to incorporate as much as I had hope, due to budget constraints, this book opened my eyes to considerations I didn't know existed. It's easy to look at solar or wind power, bamboo flooring and recycled tiles to go green; this book goes through a house piecemeal to explain concerns on every level for a much more thorough discussion of renovating green. Extremely helpful."
3,Good book but could be condensed,"I read the book from start to finish but found myself skipping over many passages of repeated information. Although the information provided was useful, the same exact info. is rehashed many times in the same chapter and throughout the book. The book format may have something to do with that with it's many recaps and review.Good basic introduction to the green industry with much information."
5,Kept the old monster running!,"The weather here in Idaho has been quite cold recently and thought I should prepare earlier this year and bought the Kat's 160W 72"" battery thermal wrap.WIth the wrap being 72"" long, I am able to wrap the battery of the Land Cruiser as well as somewhat drape the wrap across the engine bay to keep everything warm.When the temps dropped down to single digits, the early morning start ups have been super fast and without issue. Also the snow and ice on the hood stay melted and cleared off.This has become a huge life saver by reducing the strain on the starter and battery as well as reducing the amount of time needed to get up to operating temperature.Great price and it WORKS!Pros:Measures 8"" x 72"" which allows me to partially wrap the battery as well as drape the engine bay to keep everything warm.Very well constructed!Made in the USA.Oil and acid resistant vinyl cover.Cons:None."
1,Doesn't work,"I live in Anchorage AK, I bought this and installed it, no brainier, wrap the battery and plug it in. After a brutally cold night -15. I opened my hood to find the wrap and battery stone cold. Tested the plug and brand new extension cord both tested perfect."
2,Incomplete and Inaccurate,"I just got back from a week travelling around Holland. I had used this book to plan much of the trip and thought it was a great help before hand. Using it during the trip was a mistake. The maps are small, hard to read, and labelled poorly. The hours listed, descriptions and prices are out of date."
5,Great Training Ideas,"I received this DVD as a gift and was not disappointed. Since the art I study does not incorporate a great deal of kicking, this DVD gave me many new ideas on how to work on improving my basic kicking skills. Using this DVD, in addition to the Complete Kicking DVD and Top 100 Scoring Techniques DVDs by Sang H. Kim really act as a great tutorial for kicking. I can't say enough about how great Sang H. Kim's products are and how nice his company is to work with."
3,"Ehh, It's Pretty Good...","This album has alot going for it, I just can't help but think with a little more polish it could've been a great album. Musically Landshark is great, upbeat & groovy electro house. Most tracks would fit nicely into a ""Bad Boy Bill"" mix set if that means anything. You should all know this is a pretty big departure from OM's usual groovy/loungey stuff. The main problems I have are A) the vocals are poorly written & pretty corney all together & B) the track lengths are way too short. Now the vocals I can get around, they're tolerable on most tracks except on ""Shake Me"" & ""Tie Me Up"", *blech*. As far as track length, the tracks are only at most 4 1/2 minutes long, & with an intro & 2 interludes, you really only get 9 real tracks. You're only getting maybe 40 minutes(maybe less) worth of music. The price is adjusted accordingly, but I still felt a little cheated. All and all, this CDs actually not that bad, I just don't know how many repeat listens it's gonna get."
1,Pur Faucet Mount,"All I have to say to the people who gave it 5 stars just wait , you will have a waterfall too. Back to the Britta."
1,"Filter is great, but not worth spraying your sink over...","My wife and I bought this Pur Filter and installed it yesterday. One thing we immediately noticed was that when we attached it to our faucet, the water stream was no longer a smooth stream into the sink like it used to be... now it was a full-on spray. It's a real inconvenience to try to run water over a spoon or into a glass for washing when you need pressure and your stream is spraying all over your hands and sink. I haven't read any other reviews where anyone else has had this problem, so we're going to take this model back and exchange it for an upgraded model. Maybe we can chalk this one up to bad luck, but I would definitely not buy this one again."
1,5 minutes to fill a glass!,"In a word, this product ""sucks."" I have experienced the slow flow problems so many others have experienced. It literally takes 5 minutes (!) to fill a pint glass full of water. It comes out at a drip. This started happeneing after just 10 days or so of use. I am going to toss it and buy a different system. What a crock."
1,Slow Filter,I timed how long it takes to fill a coffee mug with water:Filter off - Tap 1/2 on - 4 secondsFilter on - Tap full on - 50 seconds.This is not very usable or practical.
3,"Adequate, But Pricey to Maintain","I like fresh coffee with clear water, the kind filtered from all pollutants and purifying agents. Until last month, I used a Brita pitcher to extract these unwelcome flavors. With the opportunity to try the ""PUR FM-9400B 3-Stage Horizontal Faucet Mount Chrome,"" I hoped the convenience of using water directly from my faucet would change my mornings. It did. The water tastes as if it were from my Brita, and it was as easy and quick as expected.Then it ran out. The green light indicating my filter was working turned to blink red. Red meant stop. It lasted two months, as long as the Brita, but the replacement filters cost twice the price.The clean water was what I wanted, and all I need. The extra aspect of using it connected to my faucet is outweighed by the savings connected to using a simpler and as satisfying other product. To my Brita I will return.--Brockeim"
4,Not for well water,"After realizing that I could not use this on my own well supplied water, I installed it on my BFF's city supplied faucet. Nicer than the super cheap ones, but still looks slightly cheezy. The water tastes GREAT! No more chlorine taste. It was easy to install, and not overly bulky."
3,Filters your water inexpensively,The first thing you have to do is attach this to your faucet. It comes with an assortment of plastic couplings that attach to your faucet. It will not fit on faucets without threaded aerators. The coupling that works with our faucet needed to have a thinner washer (out to hardware store for that). The filter last about 3 months with average use.
1,What a pain!,"I purchased this product in January. The mounting nut broke clean apart from the unit this past month. When I contacted the manufacturer, they sent me a coupon in the mail, which took about a week to arrive. I took the coupon to Costco where I had purchased the original unit, but they don't accept manufacturer coupons. I took the coupon to Wal-Mart, but by that time, either the sun or the heat caused the ""void"" marks on the coupon to come out and Wal-Mart wouldn't take it either. I called the manufacturer again, but they're closed on the weekends. I'm not sure whether or not they'll send another coupon. I just wish they would send me a new unit instead. It doesn't seem very polite to me to send your already annoyed customer out to the store to a buy a new unit when you could just send it to them, instead of the coupon. Although, if they made quality items to begin with perhaps none of this would be happening."
3,They leak!!,"I have gone through six of them (housing, not cartridges) in the past three years. The filtered water is good and I can tolerate the slow speed. But we are disappointed by its quality. Every six months we buy a new filter and six-pack cartridges). Unfortunately before we buy our own house we still have to use these faucet mount filters."
3,has it disadvantages,"the water tends to dribble back towards back of purr system. there's no way to change the angle of the purr how it's mounted on my faucet. the water comes out of the system slow, so be prepared to wait alittle longer than normal for your glass to fill"
3,Pur Water Filtration System,Filters do not last as long as stated by the manufacturer. Tend to leak around faucet nozzel.
3,good product with few issues,"Its a good product, but there are some basic issues- Water leaks from the connection- Pressure reduces after some days of use- Extremely difficult to replace filterI have been using this product for a while. It broke off, when I was trying to change the filter."
1,Causes faucet to leak!,Back pressure causes faucet to leak. Bought mine at Costco and now Costco stopped selling the filters because of the leak issue. Try this instead: Culligan FM-15A Level 3 Faucet Filter
2,Threaded facucet attachment is the weak link,"This filter worked well for about 6 weeks, until the threaded faucet attachment wore down. The attachment was too short; the off-center weight of the heavy filter was hanging from the faucet by only about a couple of threads of the plastic attachment. Eventually, movement of the filter wore the threads just ever-so-slightly, and it wouldn't stay on for more than a minute. Back to the PUR refrigerator container. For the money per use, I think an under-the-counter filter with a dedicated filtered-water faucet is a better buy."
2,"Poor quality, flawed design","We've had 4 of these things and all have failed in about a year and a half.The water quality is good I suppose though I guess it would take a lab analysis to be sure.The connection where it mounts to the faucet is weak and it dribbles even when installed with plumber's teflon tape.The device is slippery and in order to get a grip on it to unscrew the cartridge housing, I have to use a rubber glove.I guess it's better than bottled water but it's a pretty shoddy piece of crap.I recommend they charge twice as much, make it out of metal rather than cheap imitation metallic plastic, and put a knurled surface on the housing so it's more human friendly."
1,PUR disappointment,"I have just thrown away the second PUR FM9500 faucet mount unit I have purchased in a little over two years. They worked fine for 9 and 14 months respectively, then the cheap plastic materials failed on each of them. The side of the body gradually split on the first one, then the plastic threads peeled off the unit end cap on the second one.Calling the PUR customer service line was a waste of time; they offered no replacement parts, only a coupon for ten dollars credit if I went back to COSTCO for another $40 dose of replacement PUR. To quote John Wayne, ""...that'll be the day..."" This is a low quality product which works well for a short while, then literally falls apart. I will look for someone who wants my stash of the remaining overpriced PUR replacement cartridges. There will be no more PUR products in my house."
3,"Works OK for a ""add to faucet"" water filter","These things never work well. Water faucets were not designed to have things, excpet maybe for a simple aerator, added on. This is especially large thigns that are going to be twisted and bumped. Even more so of any (most... all) of the load bearing parts are plastic. Just because it has threads doesn't mean anything that fits will work. Leaking can be minimized by using teflon tape when you're installing it. However, it is not going to last forever and you can expect likes sooner rather than later.Mine lasted about six months. During that time the water tasted better than water straight from the tap and about as good as the filtered water from the fridge."
2,NOT as pictured!,"Item was purchased from Computer Brain of Lincolnwood, IL.My wife and I had been searching for one of the older type PUR filters. So, when we saw a picture of a horizontal, screw-on model we ordered it.The item arrived, (here in Texas), just 2 days after ordering. Low and behold, what we received was the ""crappy"", new, Click-on model that we did NOT want!I will NOT purchase from Computer Brain, OR Ron's Home & Hardware, (the company that shipped the item), again!"
1,Substandard Quality,Went through several of these before I learned my lesson. The casing after 3 to 4 months crack and water begins squirting all over the place. Though the filtrated water was good I just can't afford to continually replace units every 3 months.
1,Bad product,"As many other reviewers state - the thing leaks upon installation.If you want a faucet filter, get one under the cabinet or a whole house.Another option is the Brita, which is what we did after this leaked.I even got the stainless one, which is just the cover - it's all plastic inside and basically junk."
3,Unsatisfactory customer service,"I have used faucet mounted water filtration for years. Apparently the product is no longer handled by Procter and Gamble but is now with Kaz. Customer service was much better before when warranty replacement was accomplished by redeeming a coupon that P & G mailed to replace a defective product. Kaz now requires one to mail the unit at consumer's expense and leaves the consumer without filtration until the replacement arrives which can take 6 weeks. I have agreed to go for this warranty replacement option but meanwhile, they have just given me the opportunity to give the Culligan alternative a try. They may have just lost a customer who has used PUR for more than 10 years."
3,It Leaks,"The adapter has a constant drip. I even tried some plumber's tape and it still leaks. I cannot see why it would tell you to just put it on ""finger tight."" This is the reason I replaced it---the older version of the same unit did the same thing (maybe I'll replace the faucet, threads may be stripped???). At least the old one was made of metal - it felt beefier. This one is all plastic and seems cheaply made. I guess we'll see what happens."
3,Had some leaking problems,"The water quality of the Pur Chrome Fm-9400b is great. I has problems with the connection to the faucet leaking, fortunately I have a neighbor who has the same filter, but uses a differently connection adaptor so I was able to use one of his connectors. I think I would buy a different model if I had it to do over again."
1,Terrible Taste,"Bought this Pur FM 9400B from Amazon as I purchase most of my on line products from them. I installed the filter as instructed, ran it for 5 minutes and the filtered water had a metallic taste to it. I ran it again several times for at least 15 minutes and no change in the taste. I use filtered water for the family as well as our Dog, cat and 2 birds. I am afraid to drink the water. I e-mailed Pur and waiting for a response. I had another filter system which is rather cumbersome so thought the Pur would be better. Definately smaller but if they cant tell me whats wrong I will send it back and try something else. I will try to follow up if and when I hear from them."
5,Great Faucet Filter System,"I purchased this in lieu of a pitcher system. It is easy to install and the LED indicator for the filter is fantastic. No guessing when the filter needs to be replaced. I have not used other faucet filtering systems, but this one is easy to install and makes NYC water taste better. I have been using this filter for 8 months now without any problems."
2,Filter Fraud?,"I bought a Model FM-9400. After three months or so the light turned red. No problem: time to install a new filter. But just for grins, I reinstalled the old filter and the light miraculously (or not so miraculously) turned green. Seems the light has little to do with the health of the filter and more to do with PUR trying to make it's quarterly sales number for replacement filters. Very disappointing."
2,"More ""Made in China"" crap.",I'm about to throw away my 3rd Pur faucet mount filter. Flimsiest materials I've ever seen.PUR - I'd much rather pay twice as much for a filter housing if I didn't have to replace it every 18 months!!
2,"PUR-FM9100: Mediocre product, needs improvement.","Length:: 1:32 MinsPros:Chrome designQuick installation.Attaches easily to many kitchen faucets (unscrew the existing adapter and screw the Faucet Mount).Horizontal design saves space.Water taste very good.Easy to use filtered to unfiltered water switch.Filter removes microbes, mercury, lead and asbestos as well as sediments.Cons:Kind of awkward to unscrew and screw the front cap when changing a new filter cartridge.Built quality isn't good as you can see in the video. A better rubber grommet will prevent water leaking from the front cap.It may leak from the faucet mount."
1,Leaking Makes it a Waste,"Great in theory; however, as other reviewers have noted, the filter's propensity to leak makes it a total waste.I've had to replace the unit multiple times (both white and chrome) and no matter what I do (including using Teflon tape around the connectors) the units always find a place to leak severely."
5,"Great product, great buy!",I have been wanting a faucet filter for months. I finally browsed on Amazon and found this product. It works great and it didn't cost a lot. I recommend this product to anyone who is in need of an affordable faucet filter.
3,"Filters well, easy to install and use, not durable","This was a replacement for an earlier instance of the same filter that we previously owned. Works great, but it started falling apart after a little over a year."
5,Great... Much better than brita,"I had a brita faucet filter before this pur one, and it kept leaking and falling off from the slightest touch. This pur filter is on very secure never have to really worry about it falling off or leaking. I am happy with this product."
3,Bad leaks after a year,"We have the same problem as most, but after a year of good use. We did have to adjust it a few times, but just recently it started leaking out of the area connecting to the faucet just like the video review on here. How frustrating.I wonder why PUR doesn't try to correct this? We may get another, just because we really enjoy the quality of the water, and the fact that we can get it out of the tap for pots, pans and jugs as opposed to only using a glass that fits in the refrigerator door filter."
1,Believe it--this thing really leaks,"Nothing different to add, just need to make it plain that when you read all the other reviews that say this particular model leaks, it's not a minor, petty complaint...the thing shoots water every which way after a few months."
1,not so good,"The filter leeks constantly when the faucet is on. Brita is better than Pur. Next time I'll go with Brita, at least it starts leeking after three month."
1,GARBAGE,Filter worked perfectly for a week then water pressure started to decrease drastically. thought it may have been the way it was attached to faucet. or perhaps the filter. changed filter and still water trickled out so slowly that filling a glass of water became a serious test of one's patience. i decided to call pur. apparently this has happened so frequently with this product that they have a line set up just for this problem. according to the message i live in a city (NYC) that has hard water and water that is difficult to filter and so on...and that's all the help i got- a recording. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
1,useless,"The filter works for around two weeks and after wasting my money over time, I went back to Brita temporarily and then on the market for a more serious product. Don't buy this product."
2,Usable for about 2 weeks.,"The product worked well for about 2 weeks in New York. After that, the filter become clogged and required change."
4,what a difference!,"My drinking water smelled like rotten eggs and tasted like dirt, mildew and lead. After attaching this unit, my water is clean in appearance and taste fresh! It leaks a little after switching to drinking water, but not a big deal."
3,Slow,This looks nice and you can get a good deal on refills but the water does come out fairly slow. I also have carpal tunnel so hard for me to change the filter. I have to wait for someone to do it for me.
1,New model is AWFUL,"I had the previous model for 3 years and loved it. When it finally broke it was an easy decision to buy a new one. The problem is PUR has changed the way the filter attaches to the faucet tip. It used to securely screw in, now with the new model, it supposed to ""click"" in utilizing two plastic snaps. If you don't mind having your filter system fly off the end of faucet and smash to the bottom of your sink every few times you turn it on, then you should have no problems! The new design for how it fits to the faucet is flawed. And I have a very common Home Depot purchased Moen faucet. So it's not my faucet that's the issue. It's the PUR. After returning it (which Amazon made so easy), I changed brands. Bought the Britta version. Not only does it stay on the faucet (go figure), but also has 3 settings (filtered water, regular non-filtered flow, and spray flow) and fills a cup a lot faster than the PUR ever did. I am now a Britta convert."
1,Leaks and cracks,"We have used Pur filters for years now, not by choice but because we are always able to get a new one by calling in to the company because the unit either cracks or falls of the faucet before the warranty is up. The company is VERY good about sending a coupon for replacement with any Pur faucet mounted unit. The filter is junk, the free filters in the future kind of make up for that. If you don't want the hassle, go with another filter!"
3,Good but plastic housing,"It works as advertised, i.e. with no major problems/ inconvenience but the housing is made of plastic, we dont know - and the manufacturer does not specify - if the plastic is BPA- free. it will introduces chemicals into the water over time.They could offer a stainless steel version as well."
1,Pathetic!,"I purchased this filter after reading more positive than negative reviews on several websites. The faucet mount chrome water filter looks fine, installs easily, but it is sooooooo poorly designed that the company should be embarrassed. What some other reviewers call a slower output from the filtered water side is more like a trickle. First three weeks was bearable, slow but steady. Now, it just trickles out and takes about 2 minutes to fill an 8 ounce glass. That is, if the water actually comes out in one dribbly stream. I've taken it apart, put it back together and it will work fine for a day or two, then it's back to it's trickle. I can just guess that a design flaw creates a vaccum in the filter and stops the water flow after some use. Whoever designed this POS should be embarrassed!"
1,"If this isn't an improved version, don't buy this filter system!","I have been foolish enough to buy two of these units over the last couple of years. Both stopped producing a decent flow of water within a month or so of installing a fresh filter. The flow goes from good to impossibly poor in that time with just very modest use. After about six months, a gradual leaking of the connection turned into a major leak when the filter was in filter mode. I love the three stage filter system, but don't get this model. Get the older and less costly vertical mount model. It works much better. How a seemingly good company could turn out such a flawed new model is beyond me!"
2,Cheaply made product,"The hardware that attaches this filter to the sink is made of plastic, not metal. It barely lasted two months before it broke. Now the plastic hardware won't even hold the weight of the filter, so there is no way to attach the filter to the sink. The filter looks nice and does a good job of filtering the water, but all of that is pretty useless if you can't attach it to the sink because the cheap plastic hardware broke. This was a waste of money. We have since bought a different faucet-mounted water filter made by GE. It was less expensive, looks every bit as good as the PUR filter, and it's hardware is all metal."
1,This hardware sucks,"Just tried to install this piece of crap. The adapter leaks like a sieve, and the filter adapter keeps falling off the faucett. I won't make this mistake again."
2,So frustrating,"Ugh. Even tho' I use the PUR filter it is so frustrating. My main issue now is that the adapter that they supply is made of plastic. OK..plastic vs. metal. Is it going to strip? Of course it will over time. Too bad the time interval was only a few weeks with normal use. As mentioned in other reviews, shoddy design and failure to use good materials is the theme. The adapters should have been made out of metal. Now, the unit shoots off when you turn the faucet on.Although the snap-on design is cool, there is a lot of play in the attachment. I think the prior design was better but, similar to others, the adjustable screw on bolt would crack. Good luck hunting for a better unit. I know I AM looking for one."
1,should have known better,"I bought a used sink filter,which was advertised as like new. When I received it the filter light sh ohowed that it needed replacement. Amazon did give me credit but it still cost me $13.00 dollars to return the item."
1,Shiny garbage,"This is typical ""Made in China"" low quality wholesale shiny, easily breaking garbage. We had it for 2-3 months before mount to water tap broke. I wonder who does quality check in this country to bring something that does not comply basics of enineering. Soft, thin plastic thread to metal water tap when running water under tap pressure? Now go figure in country where every plumber has to have proper credentials yet some scammers accept garbage products from Far East of that quality."
3,More convenient than a pitcher!,"This horizontal Pur faucet mount water filter is nice. The chrome is pretty cheap looking - it's basically just shiny plastic.Pros:Very easy to installNo leaking at faucet headIndicator light for filterCons:Bulky and gets in the wayAfter turning off the water, it continues to leak through the filter for a few secondsOverall, I like this faucet head filter. We have a Zero Water pitcher in the fridge, and I tend to use this faucet filter moreso than the pitcher. It's just easier than lugging out a full pitcher of water, and there is also no waiting to fill the filter with water - you always have readily available filtered water. Overall, I'm satisfied with this filter, although, I don't see it lasting very long because of the cheap materials used."
1,Slows down to a drip after 2 weeks - unusable in my apartment,"On initial use, the water certainly tasted far better than straight from the mains and the unit performed well... for about one week.The attachment to the faucet was better quality than Brita's version, being metal rather than plastic.Like the horizontal version, the main problem, however, is that the water flow slowed down considerably after about 2 weeks and was unusable, giving only a very slow trickle, so slow that it dripped back up the faucet!It says in the instructions that water with a high amount of particles can affect the flow rate, but this is crazy! I had to return this product back to the store. I live in Manhattan, NY if that's any use to any other potential buyers.I've now tried both Pur horizontal and vertical mounts, which both trickle, then Brita's version, which didn't trickle but just sprayed everywhere. My final test is a Clear2O water pitcher... fingers crossed."
3,Very Satisfied With Product,"The water tastes MUCH better, and I feel better about drinking it.It's true that the water comes out a little slowly, but I'm used to that in a faucet filter, and I just keep a glass jug filled up, and multi-task in the kitchen while it fills.What I don't like is that all pur filters add fluoride to your water and the reports on that are mixed.The other thing is that Brita filters have two spray settings besides the filtered setting, and I miss the other setting for washing dishes.Ultimately, the reason I got this filter was so I could buy replacement filters at Costco and save money long term."
2,Filter life WAY too short,"The filter was easy to install, and worked great at first. However, after 2-3 weeks (using 1-2 gallons per day), the flow of water was down to a trickle. To fill an 8-oz water glass takes about 2 minutes. Filling the coffee maker reservoir takes forever... The claimed lifespan of a filter cartridge is 2-3 months (100 gal), but for me it is closer to 2-3 weeks (25 gal or so). This makes it a much more expensive proposition than advertised. I would not buy this again."
1,this product it's a waste of money,"this product it's a waste of money,don't buy it because it leaks a few days after you're using it"
1,Gonna try another brand,"Between my boyfriend's house and my own, we've tried about 5 of the Pur water filters including this one. They all spring leaks within 4 months. I keep trading them in thinking that I just bought a faulty one, but I'm DONE GETTIN' SPRAYED!! Learn from our mistake(s) and try another brand."
1,PUR Garbage,All three units of this model we've owned leak after a couple of months. we bought a model made by 3M today and don't regret not using the last two filters we already have for this PUR unit.
2,"Good water, Bad design","I purchased this Pur faucet mount filter system to free up space my Britta pitcher was using in my fridge. As soon as I got it out of the box, I was disappointed by its cheap plastic feel. Mounting it to the faucet was a breeze, as it includes different adapters and washers to ensure fit to a variety of faucet threads. However, once mounted, I was surprised to find how bulky it was. Washing dishes in the sink, I was constantly knocking them into the filter, or spilling soapy water all over the counter as I tried to angle them around the bulky filter assembly. Ultimately, I hit the filter with a large pot and cracked the plastic, causing it to spray water everywhere. I would give this product one star, except for the fact that the filtered water tasted very good."
2,ALL of Pur fauct mount water filter systems,YEAP we too have been going through these things like wild fire. We can run about 4 filters (we have REAL hard water with lots of lime) and that is it then the leak. Someone should turn them in since this isnt very eco friendly since you are losing alot of water while trying to just get a small amount of filtered water. I would say once they start leaking more unfiltered water leaks out then what filter water you get to use. And another thing I noticed they are saying they filter 99% but we still get tons of lime deposits on things like the drinking glasses with the purified water. Also it still limes up my coffee maker it doesnt do it as fast but there is still lime getting through which makes me wonder what else gets through since micro organisms are smaller then the lime. I dont use these to get better tasting water I use them for health reasons I dont want all those extra chemicals in my water.
2,not an expert,"I am not a home improvement person or water filter expert. However, the design of this faucet makes filling pans and pitchers with water, very difficult. My guess is that the shape of the filter does not work well with the shape of our sink; this is something people should think about before purchasing a certain model. We purchased this faucet as a replacement for the exact faucet given to us as a gift via Amazon, less than a year ago. The previous faucet began leaking in various places after about 9 months. We thought getting a new faucet would correct the problem. The new faucet, however, began leaking after one month. It is probably something we are doing wrong, but I am not an expert. This is just a description of our experience with this very attractive, but not quite functional (for us) faucet."
2,Faucet Mounts HORRIBLY DESIGNED!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am extremely picky about my water, I will only drink Sams Choice bottled. And if I have to Evian, anyway, the water that comes out of these filters is pretty good, good enough for coffee and cooking....BUT...and that's a BIG BUT........The faucet mounts are horribly designed, they break, they leak, I bought one, I had it for a couple months and it now leaks, bad enough that I cannot use it. So, now I am stuck with a few filters, of which are extremely expensive.....So, I ask PUR WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO DESIGN A WORKABLE FAUCET MOUNT?????????"
1,"Short life filter cartridges, leaking faucet mount","We have had this faucet-mount filter for about 10 months. It does seem to purify the water and make it taste better, but the filter cartridges are expensive and only lasted a maximum of two weeks for us (only used for drinking water, ice cubes, cooking water; filter cartridge used until water output was a mere trickle). About 4 months ago, the filter started leaking water out other areas, with non-filtered water ""contaminating"" the filtered water as they run together. In the past month, the filter has started spewing water out all sides--even after repeated attempts to reinstall and to use repair tape, etc. The spewing water is coming from the filter contraption itself--not from any connection to the faucet. There is no way to repair it. I hate to throw it away as we have unused filter cartridges remaining, but it is ridiculous to have water spraying all over the kitchen every time we turn on the faucet!"
4,Better Thann a Pitcher!,I was kind of sad to see that it is made of plastic. I have had it for 2.5 months now and just had to replace the filter. It is much easier that any type of water pitcher which are only one stage filters after all. It is easy to use and tells you when it needs replacing. Much easier than refilling pitchers with water.Its three stage filter does the job. We have no chlorine smell in the water. I understand that it reduces medical waste in drinking water. With bottled water you don't know for sure how clean it is.So let the government filter plants do their job and we will do ours.We can now be sure that our drinking water is clean.
1,Bad Design - DO NOT BUY,This worked for about four months before it started leaking. I was hoping the leak could be fixed just by swapping out a washer but unfortunately that is not the case. The leak is at the poorly designed swivel joint and there is no way to fix it. Do not buy this shoddy product.
1,serious quality problems,"I have been using PUR water filters in my home since last 4 years. First I have to replace the unit every year. Early this year I decided to write the company about the quality issue so they were kind enough to send me a new horizontal faucet mount unit. Ofcourse how could they break the trend. It started leaking in two months. So, I am done with PUR water filters, not going to make it to my home anymore."
5,I love it,"Instead of having to fight to get the front off to get at the filter, you can take this model off in order to do it. All you have to do is press in the two tabs on the outside and it pops right off or on."
1,Save your receipt/invoice,"I've had three Pur water filters in the last two years. I finally learned with my last purchase to keep a receipt because I have yet to have one last for the full year for which they are warrantied.They all begin to leak and, as many others have said in reviewing this product, the nylon adaptor which connects this unit to the sink does not hold up and the filter began shooting off my faucet whenever I turned the water on. Amusing for a couple times but with very diminishing returns.The FM-9400B lasted only 4 months.They're great filters for a few months but they simlply don't last and now I'm stuck with two filters from my latest pack of 6 (and they aren't inexpensive)."
1,works good for a year,This product works well for about a year and then the parts start to not fit together so well and it tend s to leak. this is the second one I have owned and I won't buy Pur products again. On the latest one the chrome finish delaminated and the entire body came unglued. It is all plastic crap.
2,"Worked fine, until it cracked",After 1 year of very mild use hairline cracks appeared. Now it shoots water out of the cracks. Most annoying because I just purchased a 6 pack of refill filters.
1,I've had three of these. All broke prematurely.,"What sort of company sells their filter housing with two filters and the housing breaks before you can use both filters? Pur! I've had three. Each was progressively shoddier in construction and broke sooner than the last. If they sold for $5, I'd say go for it. As it is, I just wish I knew what to do with the rest of my filters...I won't buy another of these."
1,Pure Junk,I bought the chrome water filter. Within 2 months this thing sprayed water all over the place. Just below the black screw-in cap was the leak. A real waste of money. Don't buy it. I went back and bought a Brita and that one didn't fit the faucet threads. Hopefully someone else makes one.
4,One data point,"I own a pH meter and a TDS meter.Straight tap water - 8.7 pH / 221 ppmpur tap filter - 8.9 pH / 205 ppmbrita pitcher filter - 6.6 pH / 145 ppmpur and brita taste just about the same, which is better than tap."
5,Taste the Clean!,"Before buying this, make sure the faucet that you plan on attaching it to a) has enough room to fit the product and b) is one of the many normal faucets that this PUR filter is able to connect to (basically all faucets with some exceptions like: college dorm rooms where the faucets are fixed on etc.)Now to the actual filter: this filter is great, the water at my house is quite hard and I can taste the difference when I use this PUR filter more so than when I used the Britta filter pitcher that I previously purchased. The filters are easy to find or easy to order (online at amazon!) and last quite a while. A light on the fixture tells you when you need to change it!"
2,Pretty sketchy,"Should have believed the reviews I read about this filter here on Amazon. Only had it a month or so and it has slowed to a trickle. If I want a glass of water it takes 30 seconds to get it and sometimes, if I have used it a lot recently, the flow slows to the point the water runs back along the filter and won't even drop straight down into the glass. Very disappointed. The water is great, if you're willing to wait for it. The product is not great. Save your money and buy a Brita pitcher. Note: I have not had the leakage problems other reviewers have mentioned."
1,Frustrating!,"Bought this filter and was so excited. Easy install, only took a few minutes. Stayed on faucet about 10 minutes, then clunk, into the sink the whole thing including the plastic adapter. Tried again, fits great without the washer, but of course it leaks. With the washer does not allow good enough connection. Thinking maybe I just got a defective one, I took it back and exchanged it. Nope, second one exactly the same (husband installed that one). Don't waste your money on this one. I am trying Culligan next."
2,How to make it work,"HOW TO FIX: I had to many filters to let them go to waste so, I brought the one piece' white plastic version and wrapped some Clear Silicone Rubber Sealant around the nozzle leak area and it has worked fine. The only problem is that you can't take the filter off of the faucet when you have to change the filter, but it's better than letting the extra filter go to waste."
1,A total Failure,Product LEAKS from the initial installation - the fittings supplied were to SHORT to allow for a tight seal...The unit is in it's box in the garage awaiting a replacement fitting that I am hoping to attain at Home Depot - Where I should have purchased the unit - this would have insured an EASY return....If you have any desire for a water filter - RUN don't walk away from this Plastic want-a-be....
1,poor design,"Today I bought the PUR horizontal faucet mounted filter. Six attempts to intall the filter failed due to the poor design. The filter is too heavy for the shallow depth/ height of the threads. No matter what I tried, it kept falling off the faucet. I tried taking the washer out in the hopes that a few extra turns would help it fasten. Naturally, this led to leaking. I tried various methods of tightening and nothing worked. On the last attempt and after running water through it for 5 minutes, I stuck my glass under it, and it fell off again. I bought it at Target and will be returning it tomorrow. Interestingly, I installed two similar Pur filters 18 years ago in my college apartment. I had the same problems then as I had today (would not remain fastened). I am shocked that after almost two decades, Pur persists with the same poor design. Time to switch to another brand."
1,I have used Pur for years,"but these newer horizontal mount filters leak. I switched to this model so that it would provide a little more clearance than the old style filter but they leak from the faucet fitting and along the edges of the part below the faucet. When the first one started leaking I contacted Pur but they more or less blew me off. Unfortunately, they were on sale when I went looking for a replacement so I bought a second one. Now this one is leaking badly, as well. I am very disappointed.One of the reasons I switched from bottled water to filtering my own was to reduce waste but having to buy a new filter assembly every year or so defeats the purpose. It also is very expensive to keep having to start over."
1,Fine until it starts to spray,"After four or five months of good reliability, the unit started to spray water from the manufactured seal around the mouth of the faucet. Then it started to spray it from more and more directions, until it had become this incredible explosion of water sprays from every direction. While this could conceivably be amusing, rest assured that it has become so inconvenient that I have started avoiding my kitchen sink.Forget this bad-news product."
2,Water runs slower and drips,"I've been using pur for about a month, now. Water flow was slow, but ok. But as time passes water flow gets slower and it starts to drip.May be my tap water is dirtier than others (I live in Flushing, NY) that lots of dirty particles are blocking water flow. But still, my tap water is not worst and I expected my filter to last at least two months. But it looks like I have to replace its filter soon, even though indicator says green.Small modification of unit design is needed in order to prevent dripping at very slow water flow."
1,Terrible quality,"Don't buy this product. Have gone thru two, on both the black plastic nut that attaches the unit to the faucet has cracked, better to return it to the seller as this is the only way they get feedback so they can stop selling this rubbish."
1,"forget it, save your money","I have gone through TWO of these units. Both eventually began to leak from underside. Same flaw in both units. It looks good, and was ok when it worked.Item is a little on heavy side - be sure your tap can take the weight.I do not recommend you buy this anyways. The cheaper plastic version worked much better."
2,"hard to get the filtered water , , ,","Kind of hard to install tightly enough, and the filtered water dribbles out toward the back of the attachment, making it difficult to collect. I still use it, but have to prop up a cup at the very back of my kitchen sink."
1,Ew,"Found little particles in my water.. and ONLY when i ran through filter. PRetty Gross.Instructions say to flucsh for five minutes, because this was normal.I flushed for 25!Returned within a week"
2,The unit keeps falling off,"Haven't had this faucet for a year and already the threads are stripped off the cheap 'plastic' part that connects to the faucet. I gave it 2 stars because it does what it's supposed to do, however that doesn't really matter when it won't even stay connected to the sink. Don't bother purchasing this item."
4,Easy Install & filter indicator light!,"I purchased this item because of PUR's detailed description of the filter performance compared to competitors'. I wish the number of microns of the filter was disclosed in the product description or at least on the manufacturer's website.Install was fast and easy. it took less than ten minutes to read & understand the directions, pop on the dispenser and push in the new filter. A big improvement over older PUR models."
2,Filter lasts under a month,Have been using this for 1.5 months and have run through both the filters that come with faucet mount.Water does taste good. But the stream of it slows down in 2 weeks and then completely shuts down. This is such a disappointment. Changing filters every three weeks is a very expensive proposition. This is out.
1,Horrible product and customer support,"We just purchased this faucet filter just a couple of days ago. The water came out in a steady stream the first day, but now it does not pour directly down put along the filter... Tried to access they support on the PUR site... but it's absolutely awful and disrespectful towards it's customers. I would not recommend this.."
1,Piece of junk,"The Pur Faucet filter is a piece of junk. I've owned it for two months and it only worked decently for about four days. It comes with two filters. I used the first filter for two days before the water began coming out so slowly it was unbelievable, I'm talking a good minute or more to fill a normal glass. When I changed the filter it worked well again for two days before doing the same thing. Not only does it take forever to fill a glass, the water comes out so slowly that it trickles down the outer filter casing and drips and drabs all over the place, rather than running into the glass. I don't know what the deal is, other than the possibility the filter is getting clogged. I've never been so disappointed in a purchase. $40 thrown down the drain (pardon the pun). I'm done with Pur."
2,Just outlives the warrenty,"I've just tossed out the second one of these I've bought, not on Amazon but from local retailers, more's the pity since I paid a lot more than this one costs. The first one lasted around six months, the second one just past the three month warranty. It's not like it gets a lot of use at my house. I'm the only one using it. With the last one, I only changed the filter once. It looks like I'm going to have to go back to my old counter top Brita system, at least until I can afford to get one of the under-the sink systems."
3,Housing Cracked on 2 Units in 3 Years,"The housing cracked in approximately the same location on the second filter in three years. A 2-3 inch crack appeared between the front of the housing and took a 90 degree angle toward the area that attaches to the faucet. Water spilled out, slowly at first, and then worsened. I replaced the filter with another Pur unit only because I had 8 filters in inventory. I'll look for other manufacturer's products when I deplete my inventory of filters."
3,"Works, if you get one that doesn't leak","I purchased two of these, one from Amazon and one from a local retailer.Installation of both was quick and easy. Water pressure is less than it used to be after installing the filter, but since I don't wash dishes by hand that doesn't bother me too much.My biggest complaint is that the one I got from Amazon leaked. It leaked out the cap that holds the filter in, it leaked out the switch that you use to switch between filtered and unfiltered water. For some reason it also constantly dripped water out of the filtered side.The one I purchased at a local hardware store works fine. No leaks (I did use some teflon tape with this one, just to be safe), water tastes great.I haven't had the filter long enough to comment on filter life.I ended up returning the leaky filter.If you get a working filter, it's a 4 star product. But since it seems to be a crap shoot as to whether you'll get a good one or not, I give this product a 3 star rating."
1,Fluoride is not good for you!,"[...]Click on the link above. These major companies like brita and pur claim that they retain a ""healthy level of fluoride"" and don't completely filter it out because it helps ""strengthen teeth"". However, fluoride is highly toxic in large doses. Why is it safe to have dentists put this stuff in your mouth, but yet they are required to carefully dispose of it as ""toxic waste"". You are being lied to. Fluoride in toothpaste is terrible for you, as it is in drinking water. Research it for yourself!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"We feel that we've given this company a few years to get this right, but I am done with this product. Over the past couple of years, we have had to contact the company at least five (my wife says six or seven) to get a new unit because the one in place leaks all over the place after a couple months of use. Once again the latest unit has started leaking profusely. I might be able to tolerate a few drips here and there, but half the water that is supposed to either come out of the faucet or come out of the filter never makes it where it's supposed to. This product has been nothing but a lesson in frustration, and I will look for another water filtration company to do business with."
1,do not buy,"i have owned many pur faucet mounted filters for more than a decade, they have been superior products till this purchase. this one is JUNK it leaked the second day after it was installed and fell off the following week, i would have returned it but the packaging got thrown out. PUR FM-9400B 3-Stage Horizontal Faucet Mount Chrome what a waste of money"
1,Horrible,Absolutely horrible product provider. The mesh below the spigot where the water comes out was bent and full of dirt upon arrival. I also received a chrome filter but I had ordered a white one.
1,Significant decline in quality,"Length:: 0:30 MinsWe have owned a pur water filter for 5 years now. This is our third and last one. We have owned this for two days and it no longer functions. The problem is that they made the system easier to install the system, but they cut some serious corners. The main thing is that they include a faucet adapter that is made of plastic. This of course is not strong enough to hold and breaks off (as you can see in the video), at which point it is now stripped and gets worse and worse till it no longer works. So now we have six useless pur filters if anyone wants one."
1,Great water filter...for a month or so,"Last year I replaced my old PUR horizontal filter. This one had worked faithfully for many years. It had finally cracked and was leaking so I purchased a new one, which had since been redesigned. In the past year I have had to replace it 3 times as it will not stay attached to the faucet. It randomly falls off into the sink, and eventually I have to hold it tight to the faucet to use the filter. Now when I try to get water it just sprays me and my kitchen and no water comes out of the filter. The worst thing about it is that the old design was great, and the water is fantastic. I am giving up on it as I have run out of patience."
1,Stress cracks and leaks,"The product will operate as intended for several months, but eventually water will leak as stress cracks begin to form in the cheap plastic from which the apparatus is constructed. The leak will progressively grow until water is no longer directed to the filter, but rather sprays out from the faucet mount point in all possible directions. Given the short lifetime of the product (maybe a year), consumers are advised to investigate more durably constructed alternatives."
5,Excellent,Had our previous one forever but this one has a quick diconnect which comes in very handy when we need it out of the way! Saves on bottled water!
2,Works Great...until it doesn't,"So it's great; filters water perfectly, progressive design and blah blah blah. One big problem. I've had mine for 4 months. That's it. 4 months. The piece that connects the actual faucet to the tap has stripped (not sure how, I never took it off once I installed it), so every time I turn on the water, the whole damn thing pops right off the tap and I get a shower. Buyer beware!"
2,Water tasted great but LEAKS!,"The ""improved"" version with the snap on faucet mount makes it very easy to install. It literally only took 3 minutes and includes unscrewing the faucet aerator, inserting the filter, and snapping on the mount.I've used mine for 3 months and my parents have had theirs for 2 months. Both of our models have leakage issues. Despite tightening the mount multiple times, a lot of water is still wasted near the indicator light where the faucet and filter are screwed together.This is not a long term investment, and it's hard to justify the cost when leakage becomes an issue after just 1 month. The water tastes great, but I'll stick with my Brita filter for now."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I give it 1 star because the water tastes good, however after 3 1/2 months use, the plastic adapter securing the filter to the faucet stripped out and will no longer support the weight of the filter. The plastic that the adapter is made from is too soft and the threads begin to distort from the weight of the filter and the water pressure when the water is running. Don't waste your money on this filter. Very disappointed."
1,Filtration seems good but hardware is not.,"I am on my third PUR filter. The first two were the vertical, plastic-cased products. They both sprang leaks in the plastic casing. For a third try, I went to the new horizontal model. It worked fine for several months but then the little indicator light, which is supposed to tell me when it's time to replace the filter, stopped working. There doesn't seem to be any way of fixing it. A call to the 1-800 number was considerably less than helpful. ""We're saorry you're having this problem. Call us back if it continues."" Now I have to mark the calendar when I replace the filter and cross my fingers that I'm timing it right. The actual filtration is good; the water tastes great. But with all these 1-star reviews you'd think they'd try a little harder to improve the hardware. It shouldn't be that difficult. I would not recommend this product."
2,"Great water, but TERRIBLE build quality.","I have had 3 Pur faucet mounts over the last 2 years. The build quality is absolutely terrible. They always get loose and leak until you are so frustrated over it that you just buy a new one. The water quality is great, but that's it. I would not care if the unit was 10 bucks, but it's not.I don't understand how they can put out such a terrible unit and get away with it. They look fancy, but that's about it."
2,Not pleased with this product.,"I've had two other PUR filters over the years and had very little problems, but this one? The ez hook up attachment for the faucet was pure junk for me. As soon as I hooked it up and turned on the faucet...the water pressure blew the filter right off the faucet."
1,junk,"the ""systems"" should be forever FREE with filter puchases, and replacements sent out no questions askedI thought my Brita was bad cuz filters were smaller, but the PUR hardware is ""pure junk"""
1,Falls apart within 3 months. Very poorly built.,UPDATE/EDIT: reduced to one star; I wish I could give zero. We have had 4 mounts fail in 2 years. PUR used to make quality products but now only make crap. Worse: they know about the issue and are not dealing with it. Call their support line and they have an automated system for replacing cheap parts. Why don't they just sell good parts to begin with? Because they just don't care. STAY AWAY!!!!!Do yourself a favor and by a high end reverse osmosis filter. The water is even cleaner and they are built to last.
1,Filters Average Only a Couple Weeks,"I bought this as a replacement for an aging Brita filter of similar design. After two months, I am considering switching back. The biggest problem we've had so far is that the filters (PUR RF-9999-3 3 Stage Faucet Mount Filter, 3-Pack) only last a couple of weeks before water flow begins to slow to a trickle. On previous models I've owned, the filters would never reach their specified 3-month lifespan, but they would at least get close. These filters are rated up to about 100 gallons. Though we drink a lot of water, we certainly have not consumed 400 gallons in the past two months!Not only do the filters have a short life, but the frequent replacing of them has taken a toll on the assembly itself. After only one month, pieces (cosmetic not functional) started falling off of body.The filter looks good, and is easy to install and use, but the frequent replacing of the filters becomes very expensive, very quickly."
5,A must have,Was surprised how well this works. We live in a place with great water I was shocked ANYTHING could improve the taste. A must have.
3,"Not what I expected, but does the job","I ordered this thinking it was a different model(my fault), and admittedly it has a cheeper look and feel than the product I had wanted. That said, it functions very well. We have grown accustomed to the bulk, and it really doesn't get in the way anymore.In the month we have had this, it has already paid for itself, as we were buying a bulk pack of water bottles every week. The local water has a very foul smell and taste to it(almost sewage like), but this does a mighty fine job of eliminating that."
2,Water Quality better than Hardware Quality,"Length:: 0:44 MinsVideo of the PUR 3-stage Faucet Mount Filter. Good water, bad hardware. We've owned 4 Faucet Mount filters. All of them leaked uncontrollably after 4-5 weeks. The filter outlasts the faucet mount in most cases."
1,No stars.....horrible product,"I have owned PUR faucets for over two years now and the story with all of them is the same: the collar that connects to the faucet broke on each of the 4 mounts I owned including this same model. At first I figured it may simply be a defective model but now I am convinced PUR makes substandard products. I love the filtered water that come out of it, I just hate the fact that they break so easily. Here's my tip to PUR: PAY YOUR MECHANICAL ENGINEERS BETTER. Now I am left with a few expensive 3 stage filters and I have no choice but to buy another one of these crappy things. Fool me once shame on PUR, fool me 5 times...I must be an idiot."
2,I Think Procter & Gamble Hates Me,"So, I just picked up my shiny, new Pur FM-9400 water filter. I bought this using my P&G; customer coupon that they sent to me to replace me previous 9400 model that lasted only a few months. In the past week I've also purchased a replacement for that water filter, but just returned it because of another leak. The one I installed today is my 4th unit.I love how easy these things are to install. You just unwrap it, connect it, twist it on and.........it is leaking again. Second time in literally two weeks. It is leaking from underneath the plastic ring and as a result it makes it completely unusable. Seriously, I cannot believe that two brand new units are broken out of the box. I haven't seen build quality like this since the Xbox 360."
2,"leaks, cracks, then leaks somemore",This my third Pur faucet mount filter to crack and leak. My first 2 had been the plastic versions so I thought you get what you pay for. I got hold of the steel one thinking that there would be no leaking. Well the outside is steel but the essential insides cracked an leaked. Never will buy one of these again.
1,POS,"I saw this product at Sam's and bought it without any research. Immediately after installing, I noticed how slowly it dripped. Then, a few weeks later, the stream was smaller and wouldn't even come down straight from the hole. Then, a few more weeks later, the connection to the fauset started to leak. Then, a few more weeks and it cracked open. Before you buy this product, read all the negative reviews. I wished i did."
3,Fine for a while,"I had a good experience with the pure filter for about 6 months. Then the leaking started, maybe due to bumping the unit, which is large and somewhat in the way. Anyway, the leaks at the faucet connection and elsewhere will cause me not to purchase another."
1,"Within months, it was spraying water everywhere","When I first purchsed this filter, I was quite happy. It was more convenient than the pitcher filters I had used before. The pleasure did not last.Within a few months, the filter started leaking. It worsened in time and now sprays water everywhere when I go to use sink--whether I am using the filter or not.I'm currently researching replacements, but I will not be buying Pur again."
2,Needs slight redesign,"The filter process seems to work well but the unit drips onto the countertop behind. This seems to be caused by the angle of the unit on the faucet. Instead of being truly horizontal, it is tilted slightly to the rear. When switched from the filter mode to the off mode, a continuous drip runs down the unit onto the counter; a definite nuisance!"
1,WRONG MATERIAL: PLASTIC construction renders product useless,"I've had 2 of these (other one was Brita) and both leaked profusely. Plastic with made-to-look-like-metal finish makes concept a no-go: leaky at best, flimsy, not durable, difficult/impossible to repair when plastic parts break or wear away (which happens quickly--days-weeks--with busy kitchen use. If these were constructed from steel/metal, then you'd probably have a good product. Sure that'd be more expensive, but I'd rather pay more for a product that works well and lasts. But this product definitely isn't it: DON'T BUY. You're better off with a simple filtered water pitcher..."
3,Primary Problem is the Plastic Mounting Adapter,"I love the PUR 3-Stage Horizontal Faucet Mount Chrome FM-9400B water filter. It an effective filtration system for a sink counter top. Now the problem...the piece of crap faucter mounting adapter. Fails after several months causing the filter to fly off the faucet. Just wait until someone gets hurt, loses an eye, then P&G; will pay big time.A simple reliable brass fitting would solve this problem. Do we need a Consumer Safety Product recall to get P&G; PUR to do the right thing. Don't hide the defect...fix it and run a public campaign to show you're responsible and care about your consummersIt is a good product concept with a great filtration system. However some ediot decided to minimize cost by using unreliable materials. P&G; wake up! Move quickly and show the public that you care and are responsible. Be like J&J;, they had a packaging and safety problem...they quickly acted and actually increased their reputation."
1,Two of two developed leaks in a short amount of time,"I've purchased two of these. The first one developed a leak within a few weeks of installation. I figured it was a fluke, plus I had a multi pack of filters, so I bought another one. The second one lasted a bit longer, but it now leaks terribly, too. It's a shame its such a shoddy design, as we were quite pleased with the quality of the water."
3,"seems works okay, but LED broke","My main complaint is that I had this product for less than a year a half and the LED stopped working. Considering the life of LEDs, this sucks. I'm now resorting to replacing the filter based on a 3 month schedule instead of the sensor. As for the quality of the water, I've used this filter system in two different cities and didn't experience any improvement in taste. I can't say anything the filtration capability since I haven't performed any scientific tests on it."
4,Great Purchase,"I bought this after moving into a new home. I had previously just used the filtration system attached to our refrigerator but I didn't like the way the water tasted so I tried this one. The water tastes great and the filters last a decent amount of time. You can also swivel the mount so that it doesn't get in your way when you are at the sink. The only thing I don't like is that when you are using the filter, the water comes out very slowly."
4,Hard Core Switch!!,"i've been on bottled, delivered water for years & decided to go another step greener and monetarily leaner. the pur 3 was my choice! it IS slow but i only have to practice patience every other day as i dispense 2 gals at a time into the water urn i own. it's been a month, it's already paid for itself..GO GREEN!!!"
2,Broke off in 6 months,I thought this was good and we used it a lot. Gently used but it kept falling off the faucet and was hard to get back on. Now I can't get it to reattach at all.Probably not the best quality for lasting.
2,It cracks to easily,"I have purchased two of the PUR filters and both of them developed cracks. The cracks occurred in the part that is directly underneath the faucet, not where the water comes out of the filter. I am reasonably certain it happens because the filter gets bumped quite often when washing dishes. I think it is a bad design since a piece that is susceptible to being bumped by dishes should be made of something sturdier than plastic. I will not buy another one."
2,Will try another brand next time,"The first one lasted about 6 or 7 months, then it started leaking around the display window. Not a drip but a nice stream if it would have been a water gun. Went to big box store and bought another one. Don't know why, no way does it last as long as it says it will."
1,"After 5 months of use, I am replacing it","First few months you use it is great. But as you keep on changing the filter, the faucet mount cap just becomes harder and harder to close and it starts leaking. I have no problems with its water filtration but I just don't like the faucet mount itself."
2,Don't Bother,"This produce leaked from the valve to operate it from the first moment we installed it. We had to send it back for a refund. This is bad quality, Don't Bother"
4,Works just fine,"This filter system is relatively compact, and seems to provide much better tasting water than that out of the unfiltered tap. However, if you are in the rare situation as I am where your dishwasher connects to the faucet for operation, you'll find removing the PUR setup a required inconvenience; the non-filtered setting on the PUR system exits the water out of an opening that is not compatible with ""quick attach"" peripherals like my portable dishwasher.If you need an easy to setup and operate, inexpensive water filtration system for your sink, this is an excellent product."
2,"Average music, poor videos",The music videos on this VHS are very poor. They are mainly black and white and are very hazy. They are also not very exciting.Her songs are OK though.
3,Just not fun.,"I gave this three stars because Rachel Brice's performance is always fun to watch. The instructional part was just boring. probaly a good arm work out, but I just don't think I will go back to this one over and over for practice. I'm not a tribal dancer, but There are so many other videos out there that get you a good work out and are fun. (Aziza, Michelle Joyce, Jenna even Veena and Neena for beginners. I guess it you are really into tribal you may like this more than I did. Also I don't recomend it for beginners."
3,Too good but too short !,"Very good exercices, and it really helps to focus on you back when moving arms and not on your shoulders.As previously mentionned above, I agree on the lack of combos to work on. And also a rough guide on how do you practice to create your own postures.Rachel is gorgeous as usual, and I liked the small interview with Miles Copeland at the end."
5,Good not only for dancers,"I am new to belly dancing, but not new to dance. This DVD makes a lot of sense; starting with build up the strength,great exercise stretching the muscles.Rachel Brice doesn't promise quick results, but mentions the necessity of consistent practice.And I see the exercises are great for me: they relax muscles when I am tired after computer work, or after driving on those horribly congested Southern Californian freeways. I would recommend this DVD not only to people who want to learn belly dancing, but also those who would like to add creativity to their daily stretches.I found the interview not too interesting, but the added bonus for me was Rachel Brice's performance, and what a dancing goddess is she!"
5,Challenging and Inspiring,"Rachel Brice is just awesome. I'm so glad she came out with this DVD (her yoga/drills DVD was a bit basic for me). The strengthening section really burns, and I love the combos at the end. This DVD has really inspired me to work harder on my arms, which are often an afterthought. Another must have for any bellydancer!!"
4,"Good, strong ""trainer""","Although I'm not into Tribal Fusion, I have the utmost respect for Ms. Brice. I saw her dance in Texas, and her control is astonishing. I like all 3 of the DVDs I got in her set, and find them, as I said above, a good, strong ""trainer."" Could be her yoga influence helps a lot. I'm a badly-injured person who needs more yoga in my life, but am having fun doing my own rehab with bellydance."
2,Good for begginers not for the rest,"I was very unsure about getting this dvd, since the first one was really REALLY basic, too basic and small for my taste.Against my better judgment and because of the long and pompous title, I decided to purchase. The title was all I got left with... and some exercises I already knew from books on posture and movement.I give this dvd 2 stars, only because it might be helpful to the ultimate beginner.Because I am a huge fan of Rachel Brice as an artist and performer (as well as teacher - her workshops are amazing and strongly recommend them) I truly hope that her next publication is a book or a manual. She has much to share and is obviously better at writing."
4,not for a total beginner,"im a beginner at this dance form. i bought this dvd to help me out with my arms and posture. while rachel does explain some of her technique, it is aimed at more of an intermediate dancer. i can follow along but im saving it for when i have a few more classes under my belt."
3,"Too little, but what's there is good","Salutations dahlin'I am giving this program a 3 because there is only one short combo, no instruction on hands, and doesn't deliver enough arm variations... on the bright side, the stretches are unique & useful, and what is there, is put together VERY well. I love how she broke things down into components.All in all, the program was, for me, easily absorbed. The combo she shared was nice, but not spectacular, and it was the only one! I enjoyed the content that was there, but I am disappointed. I expect more arms variations on an arms dvd."
3,Monitors for the kids,"I really liked the picture quality and after one year I only have one complaint. The screens are starting to flicker, I do not know if this is an Alpine problem or a connection problem."
1,More episodes PLEASE!,Not that I hate the show but the original Naruto series gave us loyal fans an average of 25 episodes per boxset. Viz (or whoever produces the boxsets) are only giving us 11 to 13 episodes of Shippuden per boxset and for a higher price! What a ripoff! Why are they doing this? And considering how long this show is running (and will continue to run for some time) you'd think they'd put more episodes in a boxset. Until they start adding at least another 10 episodes per boxset I will no longer waste my money on Shippuden but continue watching online.......FOR FREE!
1,need more episodes per box set,"I would honestly love to purchase this box set, but I can't. Viz media needs to incorporate more episodes per box set for a price of 30$. Anime listed for 30$ typically has 25-30 episodes instead of a mere 12-14 episodes per box set. I watch it online for free , but I rather pay for the box sets to support the industry. If viz wants more people to buy their box sets then they need to either do thwo things 1. add mor episodes to the box sets. or 2. make it blu ray. either solution would be reasonable because the price they are asking for isn't worth the quality we are getting"
5,great movies but they take to long to come out,these movies are great i love narruto movies but why do they take so long tobring them out i mean i have to wait 2 or more months to buy the next box set i dont like that they should go back to bringing them out every month like before
2,cheaper,if you have internet you can watch it for free on hulu it has over 250+ episodes on it and its free much rather watch what i want when i want for free
5,Holiday Music,"This is truly a bargain and the music is great, I purchased many of them. Everyone I gave them to really liked the music."
2,Lady Moses,"Yo, MDD is hottt to Life fo J-E-S-U-S. I had the opportunity to minister on the same stage with this anointed man of GOD and i was touched and impressed at the same time. His lyrics are hardhitting, real, and Most of All ANOINTED! He is going to take the GOSPEL Scene to another level of course with wifee(Celeste Williams by his side:)I threw that in for free, MDD (LOL). On another note, the cd is Hottt and i can't stop playing it over and over cause it's real. Much love to you MDD, from Virtuous Sistazz worldwide. Much luv to ya and your success."
3,Great ideas - a little outdated.,"This book is chalked full of information - but some of it is a little outdated - though not all of it. There is a lot of great ideas, information, etc., - you just might need to apply a 90's spin, etc., to some of it. I was hoping to find some really great party games -- don't buy it for this necessarily. Overall, no regrets about buying the book."
2,Sized for Tall Males only,"This vest is sized for big and tall males. The size small hits me about mid thigh. I am a female photog about 5'5"". I had my 5'11"" son try it on and he too felt it was too long and encumbered his movement even when not loaded with equipment. He wears a medium shirt size. My other son who is 6'2"" thought that it was perfect. He wears a large shirt size and coat size is a 42. We were all trying the vest on with indoor clothing underneath. Wearing over a down filled parka, perhaps would be different. Both of the giant photo vendors were out of size small and this should have been a warning to me that the medium and large guys are having to size down to get one that fits. This was purchased from Norman Camera, and fulfilled through Amazon. There weren't that many reviews, so I hope this helps future buyers with the sizing for this brand. I will be returning this vest and trying some other harness system to try and get my gear attached to me."
1,TOO TINY,"The actual item is 1/8 of picture, you need a magnifying glass to read it, if they had included a return slip I would have returned it!"
2,Sizing issue,"The two stars are only for sizing. If you have a long torso, these suits are quite small. I ordered a size larger than ususal and still was too small. If you are long torso, choose another Speedo option."
3,Make sure you like cats,"The book is a little too slim to be sold alone, and I would have preferred additional stories along with this. I thought that the cat story would be incidental to a story that mainly focused on a young, pioneer, gay author getting started, but this was my mistake. It certainly is cat cat cat. Mostly interesting, but I really wanted more."
3,Incomplete reference!,"GRAPE GRIPE: The book presents products from Malta (with a nine year tradition in champagnes), but does not mention any of the Romanian ones (with a 157 years tradition).TRIVIA: Romanians had the first wine prohibition when the king had the vineyards burnt down to sober his army up as the Romans were approaching (first century A.D.). They have a local grape variety that has been cultivated continuously for the last two millenia. Romania wass the fourth country to produce champagne (chronologically) and is currently ranked ninth by the vineyards area.CONCLUSION: While this book is an excellent lecture, calling it an encyclopedia is a bit misleading. I wonder what other information is missing..."
3,Frustrating,"This one has the potential to be a really good series but unfortunately is way too short. With only a running time of 60 minutes they try and throw together the story as quickly as possible. You barely have time to get to know the characters before the main baddie and the protaganist fight their final duel. I say this is a frustrating anime because you can see where they might have taken this in a interesting direction. The characters are interesting and the women have a tendency to squabble of the main character in the same classic Dual!/Tenchi fashion. Of course, there is no time for any of this to be developed. I was just left saying-- is that it? The artwork is good, the characters are loveable and though the story line wasn't anything new I enjoyed it. It is simply too short. I would say rent it--it is worth seeing-- but you will probably end up frustrated like me."
3,Boring Samurai Fling,"I have to give Samurai Hunt For The Sword credit for trying to be a good show. The story basically is that good guy fights bad guy, good guy loses to bad guy with corny evil sword, good guy gets equally corny good sword and they fight in the end. Two things got me really mad about this title: 1. The character development and story felt rushed and put down the quality of the show. 2. The show should have been made longer into a TV series or OVA , it was too short. Still the show had unique character designs and the tint of romance brings up the rating a notch. This show had potiental but a hasty story and poor character development stopped me from giving it 4 stars. Get it if you LOVE samurai type stories. If not you'll find Samurai Hunt For the Sword a snoozefest and a waste of money."
4,not your typical Samurai Anime or is it?,This anime seems to have very little to do with the time period it is set in and more with a magical approach of the genre. The main character is a member of dojo that believes in not killing people at all similar to Kenshin's approach but does not delve into any of the matters of dealing with not killing when you are hounde by people bent on your death with an EVIL sword
4,Simple but outstanding,"Happy with this purchase. Was pleasantly suprised by the quality and sturdiness of it.The design is minimalist, simple but classy.I haven't bought a Timex in decades as they're old school.But this watch is solid and crafted well, just like I remembered them.The cool thing is that I can wear it casual or dressed up. Nicer than another watch I paid double the price for.A great addition to my collection...something about this watchmaker. The watches are like workhorses."
5,Big Bold Basic & Beautyful,"Big Bold Basic Beautyful , Very eazy to read ,Reliabl,Durable Great style ,you can't go wrong.This is my 2nd TIMEX from Amazon.With such a vast choice of styles to choose from I've narrowed this one amongst my favorites."
1,doesn't work,the clock is consistently slow. over an hour it only ticks 45 min or so...cheap and i guess you get what you pay for.
1,Ran 15 Seconds,"Just got the watch, open package. Set time and it ran for 15 seconds and then quit. The night light does not even work. So much for Timex that keeps on ticking. Forget 10 year battery life, I expected it to as least a year or two not 15 seconds."
4,not a big watch guy,I am not a big watch person. But this watch is pretty stylish from a professional perspective. The large face is larger than normal but not crazy like some of these newer watches. Out of the box it seems fine nothing to complain about especially for <$30.
2,HUGE watch,"This watch is so large that my husband feels like he is wearing an alarm clock around his wrist so if you want one that is really huge then you will like it, he doesn't. The old much smaller watch was equally easy to read but not nearly so huge."
4,Bigger than life,I agree this is a good watchThe 10 year battery and the indiglo is impressiveThe size is far too big for an oriental
2,band material sucks,I boaght this item two month ago. But the band material is not so good. Two weeks later after the buying the color start loosing brightness. I do not resommend this item!
3,Its...okay...,"It's okay, the face is large (this can be a pro or con depending on your taste) the face numbers and markings look a little plastic like...It looks a little less nice in person. The white thread which I thought would look cool just looks kinda bad - but that is based on my taste..some may like it."
3,Adequate coozie,"To tell you the truth, I have to use two of these to equal the same insulation as one of the $4 kind I get at the market. However, I do use two, and it is about even. They are well made, just not thick enough."
1,Bad News ( Beware),"I order a CD VERSE BY Patricia Barber and they send me the wrong CD, I send it back but I have not heard from them or got the correct CD."
2,Poetry Slam Gone Wrong,"Let me begin by saying that I like Patricia Barber, and I wrote a very positive review of ""Cafe Blue"". But Duke Ellington said ""it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing"", and this recording doesn't swing. As the title suggests, this one is all about the lyrics, and in my humble opinion she's trying too hard. The end result is overly intellectual and sterile."
1,Don't !,"Don't buy it ! No rhythm, no swing, mumbled , hard to follow lyrics. A major disappointment."
4,An Adventurous Excursion,"Many people will dismiss this effort as pretentious and wordy. Too diffucult, not a swinger, etc., etc. To do so is to miss the point by a mile. Great artists take risks, and they should be applauded for their efforts. ""Verse"" requires the listener to free himself of pre-conceived ideas. To open up and to let the words and music sink in. With each playing, it will become more and more obvious, that Patricia Barber has dug deep inside her self, and come up with a totally unique idea coupled with interpretations that only she could have pulled off.Listen to Mahler's 6th, or 9th, for the first time. Tell me it was an ""easy"" experience! Keep listening again and again, and you will hear the essence of genius. THAT is what ""verse"" is like.I do not want to single any one track out. Form your own opinions as to which ones affect you the most. Keep your mind and your ears open, and you will be transported into the psyche of a true original: Patricia Barber."
5,Amazing,"The iSkin Evo3 is simply amazing. I use it in my car and its great because it doesnt slide around on my dash. The scrolling wheel without the skin on was too touchy, and with the skin on it makes scrolling perfect. Almost everybody in my family has one of these, they told me I had to get one. The only bad part is the clip...but seriously, who even uses it anyways?"
2,Not Great,"I purchased this product hoping to protect my ipod. and was disappointed with it's performance. The top portion of the skin does not pull over the top of the ipod far enough, so the top of the screen guard does not secure well. I am constantly having to pull the skin over and try to resecure the screen cover. Some other problems that I encountered is the lack of access to the hold button. There is a covering over it that prevents seeing and moving the hold button, I finally cut away this part of the skin. The last problem I had was trying to use a fm modulator that docks in the bottom of the ipod. The skin prevents a tight docking connection and the modulator kept coming out. I good idea, but poor results"
3,Detailed Minutiae of Soldier Life in Army of No VA,"I found the book an easy read. It was informative to find out the day to day life of an average soldier in the Confederacy during the last part of the Civil War. In many ways though I wish the author would have been more specific with details, but I had to remember of the time (1882) in which he wrote. He was really a product of the time, the flowery language shows and I accept this. Still some of the descriptions seemed intentionally vague, as if he was scared at offending some one, or worse yet stirring up old emotions. I would however, recommend it to a person studying the day to day life of a soldier in the Army of Northern Virginia."
3,"""Good""","Worth the time and the money (affordable price) to read about some of the everyday life of a regular Confederate soldier. It's a fairly quick read, and quite interesting."
4,wiseless comments,"Well, just try to not be so lame ^_^ Hakaider (aka hakaida) is the evil guy from the early '70s kikaider (kikaida) live shows...so find a coment about terminator,mad max even alien (1979 If I remember it well) is a bit absurd :) Also note that power rangers are a poor (american)version of other oldie japanese ""tokusatsu"" heroes.Japanese old character concepts are very imaginative.This is a '90s point of view of an old badass turned into anti-hero. It's big, It's bad, and it's gonna blow away anyone who cross it's path.Also the movie is spiced with some goth,ciberpunk and religion concepts,making goodie-scouts look as not too good boys (same to evil ones in this film)Film plays with black and white concepts.Amusing future action movie that is not a matrixspawn being :)"
4,As essential as your compiler,"For a couple of years now I have lugged the two hefty volumes of The Java Class Libraries plus the 1.2 supplement to every job site. At each site, these three books immediately became the most-borrowed books from my shelf. What is especially appealing is the ordering the material in alphabetical order by class name, like a encyclopedia. The examples are copious, interesting and solve nontrivial problems. There's also terrific background material on the theory behind each class. I highly recommend purchasing all three books (the original Volumes 1 & 2 plus the JDK 1.2 supplement). You'll need them all."
2,Fast shipping but poor packaging,"Shipping was fast, but my textbook was sent in a paper-like package. The book was in poor condition when I received it, which I was not expecting and was very unsatisfied with. Because i trust the seller, I believe that the serious spine damage and heavily dented in corners was due to shipping. However, all the pages appear to be in fantastic condition and none of the pages seem to be missing.I will have to get the spine repaired, but I would probably buy from this seller again."
4,"it's the bible, what else can you say","But like the bible, it's not something beginners can pickup and understand right away. If you are brand new to Java, make sure you get a good book aimed at novices as well."
5,Mongo is,"one of the most interesting books I've read in a while. I find myself recommending it to many, particularly those interested in 1) unusual people and 2)environmental issues.Chapter by chapter, the author describes a street-person who, during nights before trash pickup, collects items which others have thrown away and makes a profit from them. There is the individual who, through his collections, has become an expert on first edition books; the woman who takes computers off the sidewalk and rebuilds them, learning so much that computer companies consult her when they're stumped; the man who has made a business collecting beer and soda cans from the ball parks.Need I say more?"
5,uncovering treasure,I loved this book. As a life-long dumpster diver I know thethrill of finding something really great that's been thrown out.Ted Botha does a wonderful job of conveying the excitement as well as the downside of collecting. He portrays real people on the hunt and their resourcefulness is truly amazing.
4,Very nice!,I was all in all very satisfied. The product was in perfect condition when arrived and accurate in description. Shipping was fairly timely. Very good!
5,Excellent Kit,"I would recommend this kit to anyone who is taking organic chemistry. I found it very useful in learning organic chemistry mechanisms and structures. The high price is reflected in the high quality of the product!In other reviews there were a couple of complaints about the kit not being realistic. However, the bond stiffness and design are surprisingly realistic (molecules aren't all that flimsy). The kit is perfect for create virtually any small organic molecule. It is excellent for seeing the difference between a chair and boat conformation, provided that it is put together appropriately. (My organic book and the directions were useful in arriving at the right conformation when I had problems.) The kit may just take a little bit of time to get used to, but it definitely is worth the work and time to see molecules in 3-D!"
3,Good Start,"This works well for the beginning organic chemistry student ... but as soon as you get into more complicated molecules and have to start looking at hexane conformations (chairs, boats, etc) the short bond lengths start getting hard to deal with. The Molecular Visions Darling Model set is both cheaper and easier to work with."
5,Nice modeling set,"Get 2 though, larger molecules (over 14 carbons) cannot be made with this set alone, so if your getting into some more advanced organic chemistry you might wanna pick up 2."
2,Darling models are better,I found these models difficult and I decided to switch to Darling models when we started learning about chair and boat conformations of cyclohexane. The cyclohexane I made with the Prentice Hall kit fell apart each time I did a ring flip but the Darling models worked perfectly. I don't believe Darling models are available on Amazon but they are available online.
4,Student's little helper.,"Well constructed parts help beginners visualize organic molecules, with more emphasis on steric and geometric relations and less on bonding. Expensive toy includes enough atoms for most first year Organic Chemistry, but you'll need two sets for steroids and more complex natural products."
3,It would be good for about 30 dollars less.,"I didn't get this off of Amazon, but as a gift. I thought, ""Hey, this is pretty cool,"" and I used it when I was sick of OChem just for fun. But 50 dollars? I had no idea. The pieces are really not very high quality, I've broken quite a few bonds, and I can say that this is not worth 50 dollars--in fact, I would bet that the entire manufacturing process for this costs less than 5 dollars. It's just plastic. Come on, Prentice Hall."
3,Meh.,"My kit (used) was missing several pieces. It's also fairly ridiculous how expensive this is, which is basically a slightly less practical, more specific, Lego kit."
3,good buy,This product was a good buy but it could have had a few extra pieces to make longer chains of molecules. It also had too few carbon molecules beads which is the back bone of many molecules.
4,Very helpful model set,"The set is extreamly useful. The only problem I have with it is the ""bonds"" fit a little too snuggly and are often difficult to pull out. Very good very well made model set with a useful instruction booklet to go along with it."
4,Decent molecule set for the price,"There's plenty of atoms (both in number and variety) and plenty of bonds. This kits allows you to rotate atoms about the bonds (great for exploring the different conformations of compounds (anti, gauche, ellisped stuff) and converting between chair conformations of cyclohexane. My only complaint is that the bonds are sort of hard to insert into (and remove from) atoms. You really have to push/pull hard - sort of time consuming to build molecules. Sturdy kit, though. Good value and fun to play with."
5,Molecular Model Set,"Really useful for trying to figure out resonance structures. For everybody who's a kinesthetic learner this is a extremely helpful study tool, and it's kinda neat to build molecules just to see what they look like."
4,"Great for homework, maybe not tests","The kit is kind of hard to take apart and was clumsy in a test, but the different colors really help and are kind of fun to work with for homework or killing time in class."
4,basic model set,"This is your basic chem. model set. LOL The only problem I encountered was that it is hard to disassemble the models sometimes...they just get stuck. I wish the top was a little more secure. Other than that, there's not much to say! Would recommend if you're having trouble visualizing the atoms in space."
4,Missing pieces; minus 1 star,I was missing pieces inside my model! A Br and a couple of H. Im letting it slide though because of the price. I Was able to get the model for a great deal! I just wished the seller would of said / stated something about that. Other than that shipping was on time. So just minus 1 star
2,Difficult to separate,This model is very difficult to get the pieces separated. I do not recommend it. I did give it two stars thought because the mutli-colored pieces match the textbook typical colors for the elements nicely.
3,Pretty Sure It Wasn't New,"Just like any model kit, it has its issues.. The pieces can be difficult to get apart but there's this nifty cream-colored tool that makes things so much more simple.I paid full price for what I thought was going to be a new model kit. On the contrary, I was sent a used kit and received no response when I contacted the seller.I really like the model kit, though. This is definitely the way to go!"
4,"Good Product, Horrible Price",Works great and is useful but very expensive for what you get. Hopefully the disposalable pen market won't go with these prices or they'd be about $10.00 each :) lol
2,Not a Good Tool for Everyone,"First, I would like to say that I don't think that I have ever learned anything from a model and I have no idea why I thought that this would change that issue. I do have a hard earned A in Organic Chemistry but it is definitely not because these models helped me to understand anything. We cannot use models during the tests so I don't think that relying solely on the models is a good idea anyway. If you are not generally a visual learner, DO NOT BUY MODELS!!!I also do not think that these things are worth the price. They are made of cheap plastic and are often a poor interpretation of the actual models they are supposed to represent. I plan to make a rather large molecule to put on my desk. These were essentially a really expensive decoration for me. My advice, buy the cheaper ones unless you really get a kick out of spending money for plastic."
5,Organic Chem Students--READ this!,"If you're a first year organic chemistry student, buy this molecule set!!I waited till the middle of the semester to buy it because I was contemplating whether or not I wanted to dish out $50, on top of the hundreds I had already spent on textbooks.**But this molecule kit will save your life when you start learning about Chiral Molecules, S/R Configurations, Chair Conformations, etc. **If you're not that great at visualizing things like most people, you should DEFINITELY buy this.$50 in exchange of an A (or a B) on a test. You do the math.Personally I think it's too expensive for a molecule kit, but being able to build the molecules and twist/turn them will teach you more than drawings on the book. It's worth every penny.Don't think twice about buying this. It's worth it!"
3,Very Simplistic Applications,"This kit will only be useful for a limited range of structures. The most frustrating thing was trying to manipulate a C6 ring. Boat? Fugghedaboudit. And as for structures with bond angles that stray from ideal, good luck. However, if you are taking a course that does not go into too much depth with organic, this kit could be a nice (albeit expensive) accessory."
3,"Great for Understanding Stereochemistry, But Hard to Use","It's great for understanding stereochemistry, but the the pieces are hard to put together and pull apart. However, this molecular model kit is very durable."
3,Organic chem set,"This is a kind of awkward model set. It does what its supposed to but the length of the plastic bonds is hard to differentiate to tell between the different types of bonds. Also, I did not find it that helpful to studying like I thought it would be. I would say save your money and buy study guides with gobs and gobs of practice problems."
3,helpful,"If you are taking an organic chemistry class and need visual aid, this set was it. It has enough pieces and easy to connect and take off from one another."
3,The product is fine but I never had to really use it for Orgo. 1,"I bought this for my organic chemistry 1 class and bought before the class began, thinking that I would learn Orgo. better through this. Actually, I never used it and got an A+ in the course. I studied through textbook readings, and memory drills, and problems alone. Good product but useless for me (to me at least).I guess this is for people who have a hard time visualizing abstract objects like molecular compounds."
3,Pretty much as described,"This item is pretty much as described, a bunch of plastic balls and links to connect them together. It's quite expensive for what it takes to make it, although the quality is good. Computer software could probably be at least as insightful as a study aid."
3,Uneven Bond Parody,"The jokes in this 007 send-up are hit or miss, mostly miss, with a few instances of inspired comedy. It's also unnecessarily bloody for a light-hearted parody. Stephen Chow, however, is an engaging screen presence displaying the impeccable comic timing that is more evident in the films he directed, ""Shaolin Soccer"" and ""Kung Fu Hustle"". Not a waste of time but you may find yourself longing for a ""Get Smart"" marathon."
5,Fabulous Introduction & Parody!,"This is the best introduction to Stephen Chow for non Asian viewers. The special effects are easily up to par w/ all the other James Bond movies..if not better. Plus, you have the ever funny and subversive wit of Mr Chow. This was the very first one I saw of his..and still in my top 5. Maybe it was because all these HK movie books said not to watch him. Well..,they were wrong..even us foreign devils can understand this one very easily. He is the most gifted actor,writer, & goofball there is. 5 Stars for this still stands. Buy this..you'll be glad you took a chance."
2,"Heavy on spy, lean on funny","If you're reading this review to figure out a good Stephen Chow movie, stop: find ""God of Cookery"", rent/buy then go back and compare views of it with this movie.Maybe if you speak Cantonese, you might enjoy this movie more, but ""From Beijing with Love"" is nowhere in the same league as ""God of Cookery"" or even ""King of Comedy"".I was dumbfounded at how sparse the jokes are in this film (again, maybe it's a language thing). The physical gags and non-sequiturs are very funny -- of course, Stephen Chow is hilarious to watch -- but his comedy really does not work in this movie where you have bond villains, cyborgs, and talking toilets (I mean: c'mon, that's only funny for like, a few seconds).""God of Cookery"" I've seen 2-3 times -- it leaves me out of breath I laugh so hard; ""Beijing"" had me looking at my watch sighing in boredom. It's not a terrible movie -- there are a few laughs, but it really feels like the comedy was pared down with Chow's ""butcher knife""."
4,Funny early Stephen Chow movie,"""From Beijing with Love"" is an early Stephen Chow movie that is rough around the edges, chock full of problems, but full of the manic comedic joie de vivre that infuses Chow's later ""Kung Fu Hustle,"" ""Shaolin Soccer,"" and others. This film appears to have been made on a shoestring, with subtitles that may be from a fourth grade class in Shandong. But despite the lack of budget and polish, there are some very funny laugh-out-loud bits in here. This movie is not Chow's best, but it shows you how he got to his best, and it's worth at least a rent."
3,"Not Chow at his best, but it has curiosity value","From Beijing With Love is a minor Stephen Chow spoof of the Bond films that has a few good jokes but never hits the heights. Among the pluses: a neat sendup of the obligatory Bond checking into a hotel sequence, a Q figure who specialises in useless inventions such as a solar powered torch that only works when it's light, and the use of a pornographic video as an anaesthetic while removing a bullet. There's also the novelty of its hero working for the Communist Chinese secret service, but this still feels somewhat strained even at 84 minutes. More two-and-a-half out of five than three-out-of-five."
3,A funny movie!,"Let's face it, it's a James Bond parody a la Naked Gun! It's not necessarily my cup of tea, but I spent a great time watching it. This is the kind of movie that is not too complicated and that is fun to watch with friends.The main character is a butcher who is in reality a secret agent who is sent on a deadly mission after having been forgotten by his own employer for years (yes...years!!!). He is teamed-up with a beautiful secret agent who actually works in secret for the enemy (who is in fact his employer!). Like Leslie Nielsen in Naked Gun, he's not the brightest guy in the world and maybe the most naive. But he has an edge: his throwing knife... Wait 'till you see the first time he use it to understand...You can expect lots of funny situations and reboundings in this movie, but don't expect an intelligent comedy that will be remembered in ten years from now."
1,Way Off From The Previous,"Where her previous book on starting a label had some really strong points, this book is almost the worst music business guide I've ever purchased. I would really not recommend this to anyone."
2,Lousy jacket...save your money...,"I bought one of these jackets on a lark. After all, it's a Rockport brand jacket (not that they're known for jackets, but the name stands for a certain level of quality), and the price is oh-so-right.But the jacket is oh-so-wrong. The leather itself is buttery soft and nice enough. But the cut is really bad. The jacket is wide and very short. I'm not sure what male body type that flatters, but I know it's not mine. The jacket is also extremely thin/light. When I got the box in the mail, I wondered what it could be, because the box was too light to possibly be a leather jacket. Guess again...I have purchased a LOT of stuff from Amazon over the years, and this is the first item I'm returning because, frankly, it stinks..."
3,SLOW!!!!!,"I am generally happy with the camera and quality of the pictures, but the start up time and the shutter lag are some of the slowest I've seen. My family has 6 p/s cameras from all different manufacters and this Optio is the worst.I just don't understand why the companies promote ""face recognition system"", ""anti shake"",and high megamixel when what we really want is a camera that will take a shot when you press the button!"
5,fab cam,This is a great camera. Light weight. Takes amazing pictures. Speedy delivery. GREAT price. I recommend this camera to anyone. A++++++
4,Less Breakable,My husband is the cook and he is also very hard on kitchen products. I had a vegetable chopper from Pampered Chef made of plastic; it broke with usage and he missed using it. This one is mostly steel and I have high hopes that it will last. He's very happy with it.
3,Hard to clean,"This little chopper works fine. I have chopped onions and green peppers, garlic and the like and had god successful. The only issue I have with it is that it is hard to clean.So far, the best approach I have found has been to use an old toothbrush. If the handle came off easily so the blade could be accessed, it would be much better.Now, all that said, it didn't have any instructions, so perhaps I'm missing something."
2,Lasted For a Few Months,"My wife and I bought this chopper after our Oxo chopper from Bed, Bath, and Beyond wore out after 18 months of use. I hoped that the stainless steel construction would make this a more long-term chopper, but unfortunately this was not the case. After about 7 or 8 months, the spring within the chopper gave out, and we were on the hunt for a new one. Beyond reliability limitations, this model is also more difficult to clean after use as the chopping blade is not removable for easy dishwasher cleaning.My wife and I have since moved onto the Chef'n VeggiChop and have really enjoyed it for the past 5 months. It has a much larger capacity, an easy to clean design, and seems like it will last longer than our previous choppers."
5,Chopper,This was a christmas gift and it worked out great. I will also reap the benefit of this kitchen tool and I am happy with the quality of the chopper. It is a great utinsil to have in the kitchen.
2,Very limited uses.,"It chops garlic (skin on), jalapeno, and other hot chilli peppers brilliantly without leaving the harsh scent on your hands. Unfortunately, the blades are too flimsy and too dull to cut anything else. When I attempted to chop an onion, the blades merely bruised the onion, or left pieces of onion lodged between the blades. This even occurred after cutting the onion into smaller pieces, as recommended by other users. The compartment space is small, and the cap on the bottom of the compartment prevents the blades from working properly. In order to use this product effectively, you must remove the cap, and use a cutting board (thereby releasing the scent of whatever you are chopping, and rendering the cap feature useless). Unless using this solely for the purposes of chopping garlic, scallions, jalapeno, and the like, I would not recommend this product."
3,This item was not what I was hoping for.,This item was not what I was hoping for. It is about the same as all the other hand choppers I have used. It turns tomatoes into mush. I ended up buying an electric one and I am happy with it.
1,Not worth it,"I bought the chopper for vegetable chopping, and it was extremely difficult to use and the blade would constantly come out of the cylander and was dangerous. It broke after a few attempts at cutting a vegetable, not worth the money, spend more on a professional chopper."
2,Falls apart too easily and hard to clean,"The pieces do not have anyway to lock themselves together. This creates problems every time in the chopping process since the bowl separates from the chopper. When the food is finally chopped and you want to transfer it to the recipe, the base promptly falls off and spills the finely chopped ingredients over your work surface. It offended me and I chastised it severely. It is not among the living now and will sin no more."
4,seems to be as good as pampered chef,"We had the pampered chef chopper before and this seems just as good , seems well built , not sure why other reviews or description mention chopping nuts only- we use for onions etc etc"
1,Parts missing ... twice!,"Although the description and packaging clearly state that a screw for the tripod mount AND and a belt clip are included, they were not ... not on the first one, not on the replacement. The elastic safety wrist strap portion also has no means to create a wrist loop as pictured on the packaging, and if it were somehow looped back on itself, it would be rather small for my medium-smallish wrist, nevermind a hefty man's wrist. I have to suspect that there's a part to that missing as well.I use other Zing products and like them, but the quality control for packaging this one is abysmal. Too bad I'll never find out whether the product itself is any good."
3,This is the one I will use despite problems,"I had the same problem with not getting all the parts with this product. How lame! I purchased a few camera straps since I figured I'd probably be picky about comfort. Neoprine is definitely comfortable. Instead of returning it I decided to work on it.I went to the camera store and purchased a retaining screw. I put that through the hole on the strap, there's no reinforcement on the wide strap, but it's sturdy stuff. Then I worked on the wrist strap. It was insanely difficult to get the thick end through the tiny buckle, but I finally was able to, and it is functional, fortunately my wrist is skinny enough so it isn't too tight. I attached the neck strap to the ring on the strap.The strap isn't the ideal shape for my hand, but it's the best for me that I've found so far."
5,Great strap with many GREAT features,"This Zing strap is ideal for the following reasons:1) It's foam, not hot sweaty leather... Comfortable and cool...2) It has a REMOVABLE wrist strap, and believe me if you are king kong, it might not fit but it is elastic and full expandable... Removable is nice when you are in a crowd and do not want to lose your camera to a fleet footed theif...3) It has an eyelet to attach a neck strap, WONDERFUL!!! No more taking off the hand grip and attaching the neck strap, now you can have BOTH whenever you want!4) Adjustable for most cameras.Now for the mildly not so good:1) Attaches with a loose wing nut so no using your tripod as it shares the same socket... NBD to unscrew, just don't lose it like I did LOL... (On my 2nd Zing)2) There is some lame metal hanger to attach your camera to hang on your belt/somewhere else, just picture your dslr hanging from your belt LOL) oh no no no, threw it out pronto.All minor knocks on an overall EXCELLENT product, just buy it!"
4,Cute Gift!,"I bought this to give my aunt, who collects Portmeirion, as an ""add-on"" gift for Christmas. Very cute!"
3,It's too smaller than I expected.,It looks pretty and sturdy but I don't know for what to use it. It's too small to do something.
2,That's it?,"There is simply not much to this book. When you pick it up, right away you realize that it's very thin (by that I mean there are not a lot of pages.) That's not even considering the fact that there are a lot of photos and the last chapter isn't even about leopard geckos...so the amount of leopard gecko information you are getting is minimal. I suppose it's better than nothing if you don't know anything about leopard geckos and you also don't have an internet connection. If you have an internet connection, save your money and get more detailed information for free on any one of several free forums/care sheets available on the web."
3,Quite basic,"I'm buying a leopard gecko in a few months :), so I've been looking for info on the net.After reading some articles, I purchased this book.It has some nice pictures and basically everything you need to know, but it's too basic.I expected to find more about feeding, genetics...insted I just find a little information about what to feed and some gecko morphs pictures. It shows the existing morphs but doesn't say what gecko morphs you need to breed in order produce a determinated morph.Good to start, though. Now I'm buying the Herpetoculture of Leopard gecko, hope I find more info there."
4,Gecko's are cool!!!,we were given an adult female gecko and this book was very helpful in the cluing us in on how to properly care for these wonderful lizards. With all the detailed pictures and neat facts it is a must have if one wants to learn more and care for leopard gecko's
3,Some good info but you may need a dictionary,"Here is a story.A family with a second grader is thinking of getting a gecko. This book has good reviews. The second grader can't wait until the book arrives, and then when she gets it, she can't read it because of all the unnecessary big words and awful writing. So, the parents read and translate it for her.So that's why I give the book three stars. There's good information in there, but it's so unnecessarily DENSE with big words vs. simple ones (are the authors trying to seem smart? Do herpetologists have an inferiority complex?) There's also a lot about breeding and developing your own ""morphs"" of geckos that we aren't even going to touch, so much of the book was irrelevant to us.On the plus side, the basic information about feed, care, and creating a good environment for the gecko is all there. And the photos are great."
1,Outdated,"It's really outdated. Since it was written, there have been many more studies done on reptile husbandry. It says calcium sand is THE substrate to use and it's one of the worst ones. BEFORE you get the animal I suggest joining reptile forums, as most reptile breeders/books are also outdated on care. Leopard geckos make wonderful pets, if cared for properly can live a long time also."
4,I love this card,"the install depends of your hardware and s.o. i have win2k and motherboard intel so it was easy.you can use this card in many ways :i use for games and sounds very well.i download midi secuences and play midis using the soundfonts , i record it at wav format then i burn it at cd-audio and sounds very well .i play some times dvd-audio discs the output is analog no digital, (all dvd-audio players are analog output)ok, four stars because:Strengths: DVD-Audio, Dolby digital EX, many inputs and outputs, EAX, Remote control, support soundfonts last version. 2 games and music software, THX Certification.Weaknesses: no SACD, no DTS-ES or DTS , problems with some motherboards"
4,"A bit short, but works great!","This is an excellent compromise compared to the longer, bulkier retrievers. The spring-loaded grabber works very well, and the shorter length (about 6 feet) was normally adequate in all but a few cases. A good product that'll pay for itself in a very short time."
1,What No Karaoke Tracks?,"This item was released with guide vocal tracks and instrumental tracks for singers to use at home, just like regular karaoke tracks. The download seems to contain only the guide vocal tracks. Stefano Secco is an adequate tenor, but if I want MP3's of Tosti's songs, I prefer Caruso, Gigli, Schipa, Bjoerling, Corelli, Del Monaco and Pavarotti."
3,My Comment on the CD,"I bought this CD (or actually CDs), for I wanted to listen to Tosti's songs.I also have StefanoSecco's Tosti's album with piano accompaniment.Stefano Secco's performance with the archestration is not better than thar with piano acconpaniment.Worse while, orchestration minus one is something like a white elephant."
2,"Thick blade, awkward grip","Santoku knives are characterized by having a very thin blade. That's what makes them so good at cutting vegetables - you don't have to force a thick blade down into a hard carrot or parsnip. Unfortunately, the Anolon doesn't live up to the Santoku standard.This knife has a very wide blade, meaning a lot more chopping effort. It also holds its edge poorly (and was even dull when we first got it). Both my wife and I also find the grip very awkward. The size also limits its usefulness - for example, it's too small to chop onions.This usually just sits in our drawer as we use a higher-quality chef's knife. It's cheaper than other knives, but still not worth it. I'd rather pay more to get a quality knife, such as Cook's Illustrated's top recommendation, theMAC Santoku."
3,Average - Try one in your hands first.,"I have this knife only because I had a gift certificate. I wanted a Santoku knife, so I thought what the hay. Had I known how heavy it was, I would've picked another one. It's my fault for buying a knife w/o actually having it in my hands first.My complaint is just the weight, it's heavy. I also never quite like the rubber grip. But, this is relative to one's preference, I guess. I also have to sharpen this knife quite often.Just for a reference (why I think this knife feels heavy to me), I'm used to my wife's Global GS-5.Learn from me, don't buy a knife online before having it in your hands first.**Let me add, sharpening this knife is a little tricky, because there's a lump at the heel of the knife. It prevents me from making one smooth sweep when sharpening, using a rod."
4,GARMIN 010-00321-00 GPS 18 Deluxe USB Sensor for Laptops,the GPS works great with my Eee pc. The software (maps) could be alot better but that is the only fault i have with this product.
5,great,"The gps system works great. It is easy to navigate and find destinations. I use it mainly for long trips, but I dont use it as much as I could because sometimes I just keep driving around instead of pulling out my computer when I am in unfamilliar place. It is better than the handheld devices but a little less convenient."
4,Garmin GPS Sensor,It was easy to load on laptop computer and works fine. It will even pick up several sattelites inside my house. It picks up a lot more outside and is a lot more accurate when picking up more sattelites.
4,first time user,"The product work great. I checked it on routes I have used for years and learned new and shorter ones. The shortest route is not always the fastest. I can think of some enhancements that would make it better, but overall it's a great product."
4,Needs some updating,"I really like the city select and Nroute. How it helps a traveler who doesn't know where he is going in a stange place. I took it to LAX and toured LA with no trouble at all and I had never been to that city before. I do think it needs work in out lying areas. My son lives at the Edwards AFB and the program has trouble finding the shortest and fastest routes. I think because it always tries to get you to a major high no matter how far out of the way it takes you. I realize the program writers don't always know how the secondary roads are going to be. Taking that into account , my glad I have it and will use it often."
4,Great product! I wish I could give it 4.5 stars.,"Great product! Easy to install (no issues from my DVD ROM). Plesant voice commands (does not name the roads, however). Great mapping software! Automatically adjusts the contrast variant on the time of day. Super fast aquisition of satelites...even from the middle of my living room (cant figure that one out!) Tracks my position perfectly on the maps (unlike the Delorme LT20). Its the best one for this price range."
2,Only works with included software,"The GPS receiver works fine with the included nRoute software, but since the device supports only Garmin's proprietary communication protocol (it does NOT support NMEA, the standard protocol for GPS devices), the GPS 18 will not work with other mapping software such as Microsoft Streets and Trips or DeLorme Street Atlas. I find either of these two programs to be much easier to use than the included software, and am very dissapointed that this GPS receiver is not standards compliant, even though recievers made by Garmin in the past have been."
2,Need a lot of improvement,"I bought this for preparing trips going to multiple stops. The software is definately NOT for the task of figuring out the best route to connect all stops. A piece of cake for Honda GPS and even for Microsoft Trips.The search is too dummy also, e.g. It tells me the nearest ""Walmart"" is 72 miles away. Later I figured that the actual ""Wal-Mart"", searched by ""Wal"" instead, is only 4 miles away."
3,Its a cool gadget but not worth its price...,"well for something that requires your laptop, it makes the whole trip bulky, however its a cool gadget if it were cheaper..."
1,Just because you do everything right it does not mean success,"As a past satisfied customer, I decided to look for a ""bargin"" re: my desire to purchase a Garmin GPS 18,I selected a seller that seemed to be a highly regarded provider. I should add at this time I check with our son, who has been involved with computers and software for 27 years, for his thoughts on what I was doing. My unit did not work and after one hour and half hours with Garmin, we were instructed to return the product under the warranty. Upon return, we tried again to install the unit, this occured after spending a half an hour with tech support. It seems we are not able to connect to the approbrite driver. I will again call Garmin this Monday. I'm waiting to help reduce my frustration level.Our son says, ""We did everything right"""
3,"Great hardware, weak software","GPS itself works great, picks up weak signals and stays locked on. The software is weak. It is extremly clunky to find addresses, as others have described. There is a cumbersome guessing game you have to go through to find locations. The interface is buggy enough that there are times I cannot use it on a particular trip, because I cannot trick the software into finding the location. Overall, a decent value, but just be prepared for the interface."
3,GPS-18 & nRoute City Navigatior,"Don't attempt to operate this system on your own while in motion!Everybody accepts the disclaimer at the opening of the application, but you simply can't be looking at the screen while the vehicle is in motion if you are driving!!!Other than that, it will get you where you want to go if your right seat passenger doesn't mind operating the laptop, on their lap while driving...If you have some way to mount a laptop in an easily visible position for the driver, different story. I don't have the option of mounting the unit & don't know anybody else that does, so it's usefulness really quite limited."
4,"Sound product, great price, data needs update","Great purchase overall! I looked for a GPS unit for an affordable price and have a laptop PC available in my car at all times. Also, I use this device mainly within one city and found it to be tremendously helpful, especially when taking the price into consideration. The chosen routes are quick, direct and the accuracy remarkable. Due to the laptop availability in my car, I preferred its larger screen to the (more expensive) smaller handheld devices. The only drawback I have seen so far is the somewhat outdated street data in newer sections of the city/county. New developments that were built two years ago, still only show undeveloped area and no streets. If they would keep this data more up to date it would receive a definite 5-star-rating from me."
3,Great product but...,"My husband and I have been fans of Spiru-Tein for years, it's expensive but worth it. My husband wanted to try the Sport Turbo Chocolate (might very well be the name) but after I received it I saw that the serving size is 2 scoops -so half as many servings per container.A look at the ingredients seems to indicate a near doubling -so I have to wonder if you could turbo charge your Spiru-Tein by simply using 2 scoops, except the amino acid profile is the same -so if you only used 1 scoop, you'd get half the amino acid profile per serving.So, bottom line, (compared to regular Spiru-Tein): 2 scoops per serving, 18 servings per 2.3 lbs, same amino acid profile, 2.6x the calories, 9 grams fat, twice the carbs, 4 extra grams protein. + 1gm trans fat and 80 calories from fat."
5,WOW!,"I can't say that I am a Judy Garland fan. I really don't like any of her movies except ""Wizard of Oz"" and most of her songs don't appeal to me. But after seeing this I can't deny that she was one brilliant performer. With all the troubles she was facing she managed to put on an outstanding show. She is one of the best show hosts I have ever seen. I know if her show was on today I'd pick her over Jay Leno in a second. The moments with Barbra Streisand are classic. I wish they could have been on more shows together or even done a movie together. I'm a huge Barbra fan and it's trilling to see such a young vision of her performing next to a legend."
1,Beautiful Junque,"The outward appearance of this is very nice indeed. Upon turning it over, you find that the terminals are very close together at the ""bottom"" of the bowl formed by the bezel. As you try to get a screwdriver in at the proper angle, if you apply any torque to the terminal screws, the switch and light assembly shears off the ring connecting them to the button. The only way to avoid this is to very carefully connect fine (22 gage) wire to the terminals and then splice it to the wire coming out of the wall from the doorbell transformer. Heath and Zenith as separate companies used to stand for quality. This button-made in China, of course-is no credit to the current company, and it is disgusting that two honorable names are being used to peddle poorly designed, yet costly, junk like this."
4,Interesting reading,"This is written in an easy to understand way. A lot of sense was made, however I did skip through some , it seemed a tad repetitive in places.I am a mother of a 22 yo daughter, and found reading this helped me get into my daughters head a bit more and understand her illness more"
3,great little product,This little guy has saved my bacon more than once. It is as quick as USB 2 gets and takes up so little space. It is quiet as well.
1,"Despite the good cause, do not buy this for small children .","This book is a retelling of the classic story by a few dozen celebrities writing and performing (on the CD that comes with it)the parts of the various characters in the book. I was not at all happy to find that a book that is certainly meant for small children contains much that I found inappropriate for my 4 year old and even my 8 year old. This collaboration turns out to be an opportunity for some well meaning, but clueless, celebrities to entertain and impress each other. Many of the characters are needlessly mean spirited and vulgar. Between the 'potty' humor of Robin Williams to the use of the term 'schmuck' by Fran Drescher there is plenty to make me put this book/CD in the trash. There were several classy and thoughtful contibutions including those from Angela Lansbury and Nathan Lane, but this was not enough to make up for the other shortcomings.If you like the cause send in the $30 and tell them to keep the book and the CD."
1,"A disappointing remake of a wonderful, old classic story.","While reading this book to my six year old grandaughter I struggled to finish the story because of the inappropriate, wise-guy, smart-alecky language. I returned the book after the first reading and purchased the wonderful original which we both loved reading."
5,In-Focus Home Projector,"I have owned this projector for 18 months and it is great. The remote is what makes this a great deal. It will adjust the screen projection to wide or full screen depending on the DVD type. I paid $1288.00 for my projector and screen, so this is a bargain."
3,quality questionable,"Unfortunately, the ONLY women's digital dress watch available with both the date and a light. Great appearance and features, however I am now on my third one. It seems the indiglo light feature gives out in less than a year. Although Kohls has been good about taking them back, I'd like to see them improve the quality."
5,Good deal. Great looking,My son wore this in his wedding and it looked great. Color was just write and fit was good. Best deal I could find. Would definitely buy again.
2,The Things with Wings,"I am an adult reader of chidlren literature. I thought the book was a sleeper. Green powder, a widower father who is never around in such a small town if you sneeze your neighbor says God Bless you. Come on this book was so boring. After the first hunderd pages I wonder when something was going to happen that was interesting and not so ridiculous. In it the story just the whole adventrue seemed stupid."
5,A Great Read!,"I think this book is good, I read it in the 5th grade. My teacher had it because she ordered it from a bbok club. I think that this book is a good book to read while you wait for something because time flies when you are reading it! E-mail me at: KristinEnglish@catsrule.garfield.com"
5,Draws you in. Geat book. Couldn't put it down. A+,I was very impressed with this book. It is packed with great insights and was not as dry as other books on the subject. The comparisons are interesting and the writing is fantastic. If you want one small volume for a great overview of totalitarianism this is the one. I could not put it down. A+
5,Very bright,"These lights are very very bright. I use them on my motorcycle for visibility. They last about as long as a set of tires- which isn't long considering the price, but when they go out I always replace them because I have found nothing better.I guess I should say they do some good as a driving light- but the pattern isn't as deep as you would think."
4,PIAA 15352 bulb,This is a great product for those looking for the replacement bulb for their PIAA driving lights. I would like to know the color spectrum of the bulb before I purchased. This bulb was too blue of a color to match my other driving light. Amazon has a great return policy and cooperated fully on my return.
3,Fun for the Younger End of the Age Group,"My son got this for his 2nd Christmas; he was 22 months old. He had fun with it for about 2 months, but by then he'd grown taller and was too tall to really enjoy this toy. He's tall for his age, yes, but I don't see how a 3 year old can use this toy unless s/he is very small for their age. I'd say this toy is better for the younger end of the age range, closer to 12-18 months old. (My son was wearing size ""24 months"" clothes, and was too tall for it.)"
3,Hasnt been used much,"Bought this for a 15 month old who's now 21 mos. Hasnt used it much. Probably bounces on it 10-20 times and gets off. I have to turn off the music because if you leave it on it goes off any time there is a vibration in the room (which is a lot in my household of boys!). It's one of those toys that looks fantastic, so of course I bought it, but its used less than I would have expected. Maybe your child will like it more, but mine doesnt care that much."
3,Not as fun as it looks,"I really thought that my 16 month old would love this toy. That wasn't and still isn't the case. He will get on it for a few seconds, jump a few times and then he is done. I think my almost 3 year old has played with it more. There isn't much to it, but what kid doesn't like to bounce? I am hoping that he will play with it more in the future, but now I know why there were so many used ones for sale on eBay!"
4,Great toy!,I bought this for my 8 month old grandaughter who giggles like crazy when she is on it. My 2 1/2 year old grandson also loves it and it's nice that he can play with it as well. It has music and a spinner and great noise. My only regret is that it doesn't have stirrups!
4,great toy but to small for a 3 yr old,My son has had this toy since he was 6 months he loves it but now that hes a year old he bounces it so hard that the base comes off the floor I'm worried its going to break great toy I bought it a yard sale for $5 !I just think its for more for 1 or 2 year olds.
4,My daughter loves this toy,"My daughter absolutely loves this toy. I like that it is made so that it will not try to ""spin"" while she is trying to get off of it. She loves the lights, the neighing and galloping sounds it makes, and the contrasting colors. She loves spinning in circles and bouncing around while riding this toy. She does not have any problems in staying on or getting off of this toy. She also loves the fact that it's a zebra wearing tennis shoes. She points it out all of the time!"
3,Not all that interesting to baby,"Seems safe and of fair quality. Cute. Doesn't take up too much room for a ride-on toy. Got it when son was 18 mos; he's 2 yrs now. He was excited when assembling because he pretended to screw in screws. Not too into it beyond that. Goes on it once ever 3 wks or so, 5 mins. Bounces up and down. When seated (i.e., seat pushed down), baby can turn it around (or you can), but really it mostly let's him bouce it up and down. It's a little jerky, not springy like something made with springs. I think he would've liked something w/ springs because that's more of a RIDE, not like this zebra where he's more launching himself one time at a time."
1,Boring/waste of money,"I am a BIG toy buyer. Over the years, this is the ONE toy that sticks out in my mind as the BIGGEST WASTE of money! It was about 50 dollars when I bought it. I was so excited at the time.I really thought my daughter would love it. I could not have been more wrong. I got it home, put it together, placed her on top of it, showed her what it did. She looked at me and just got off. Over the course of a year she would walk over to it, sit on it, turn it, and then get off. She was so bored with it. After a year and a half, and her reaching the age limit, I just gave it to a neighbor that had a little boy that was about a year and half. I was happy for it to be out of my house, and no longer taking up the space. I am not sure if their little boy enjoyed it either. I hope he did, so that 50 dollars was not a complete waste. I would never buy this product again. And I have definitely NON RECOMMENDED this to several friends."
1,A Serious Disappointment for Kids,"This looks like it would be a blast for kids but it isn't. First of all, the age requirement is a joke. It says 12-36 months but there is no way a 3-year-old could ride this thing. It is really small.Another problem is that it doesn't bounce much at all and is very difficult to spin. Bouncing on this thing would give me a headache. I don't know about little kids, but mine didn't like it at all. This was such a waste of money and space in my house."
3,price is way to high,just want to tell you all i recently purchased this item at walmart for $34.00 and at toys r us its 44.00 so if your gonna purchase this item do not buy it from here its too much money and u can get it cheaper some where else.
3,save ur money,I just came from toysrus where this toy is literally $4.50! So save yourself 75 bux n buy it there... :)
5,15 Month Old Loves It,Its verey durable- she's the third to use it after two boys! And she'll sit and jump while watching tv with her great-grandpa. We love it.
4,Bonce and bounce and bounce,"The baby loves it! She just bounces on it all the time. I had to remove the batteries though, because it was driving me crazy... She still plays with it!"
3,a big pain,my children love bouncing on the toy and the great thing is both my one year old and my 2 year old can both use it. The only thing was it was missing parts so I had to call fisher price and send back the zebra body and they sent me a new unopen toy so due to this I would say don't get it online.
3,Fun Toy For Awhile Drives Neighbor Crazy,"We had this toy for about six months that was about it. My two year old son liked it at first but would only get on it every so often. When he did get on it we sure thought our upstairs neighbor in the condo would jump out the window. She was stomping on the floor as my son rode this. She was stupid enough to install a wooden floor without soundproof above us knowing I had young kids. My son is rough with his toys, and really made lots of noise on it jumping fast. This could be why you see lots of them on ebay other than that I can say the toy is durable because my son gave it a beating. It is also easy to install compared to the other riding horses you see out there, and small enough for young kids."
5,Long term Favorite Buy!!!,"We bought this for our son when he turned one. He really loved to make it bounce up and down. After a while he learned to make it spin. Now, at 2 1/2 years old, he still really loves it! He bounces and spins at the same time. It has been a great way to burn off that energy when the weather is bad. As far as educational, balance and cause/effect are major milestones at this age- and it certainly goes far towards the muscular and coordination skills. It reminds me of the spring horses I enjoyed as a kid, except that this is much lower to the ground and safer. We use it on the carpet, but we have never had any accidents. It is much more accessible to a younger child than the spring horses are. I really have to say that it is an all time favorite toy, and the cost is really reasonable. If you live in an apartment, it may seem big- and not worth the room it will take, but if you have a little one with lots of energy in a small apartment, this is probably a very helpful purchase."
3,so and so,"My friend gave this to our son as a gift when he was 20 months old. I believe he might be too old/tall for this toy, although from time to time it gains his interest. He sometines bounces with the lights flashing and music on the loudest setting, moving it around the hardwood floors (luckily no scratches), other times he stands up on the toy, which makes me nervous. He did fall once, with no injuries.I particularly believe that the toy is too loud & flashy, but on the other side, it seems durable and stable."
4,A great toy for an independent child!!,"Bryce got this toy for his first birthday last month. He was still a little bit short for it at first. If we sat him on it we had to bounce him as well because he couldn't really figure it out. He could always get off OK by himself. Sometimes the Zebra would spin while he was getting off and he'd fall, but he'd still be hanging on to the handles. It's very close to the ground, so even if he fell off from the seat, I think his ego would be more bruised than his body!!Now that he can get on and off by himself, he really enjoys it! He used to love his Jumperoo as a baby, but it's too restrictive now for this little independent guy. The Bounce & Spin Zebra is perfect for jumping and spinning, both of which he's come to master!"
2,My 18 mo. old was to big/rough for this.,"This Zebra is adorable and a great gift for little ones, but not oversized, rough'n'tumble tots like my son. We bought this for him for Christmas when he was 18 months old and it seemed like he was to big for it. He's a tall tot and he plays rough for such a little guy, and when he got on this thing it took a beating. When he bounced on it the thing bottomed out everytime, I thought for sure he was gonna brake it. It did however hold up to the abuse. He lost interest in it very fast, I think party because he's to big and it didn't bounce the way it should. We decided to give it to his cousin, she's the same age but much more petite and gentle so it worked out better for her."
4,What a great toy!,"My 18 month son loves this toy! He has no problems getting on and off or staying on the zebra. The zebra is also very easy to spin. I only gave it four stars because it took him several weeks to learn how to make it bounce, but even before he could make it bounce, he still loved being on it. I was surprised to see so many negative reviews for this toy. I think it is a very original toy that does exactly what it claims. Maybe some parents are buying it for children that are too young, and a child that is not within the recommended age group may not be able to enjoy the toy because of their height."
5,Still a hit after a year!,I got this for my son for his first Birthday and after almost a year he jumps on it everyday. It seems the older he gets the more he enjoys it. While it only holds his attention for a few mins he does jump on it several times a day. We packed up a lot of his toys in order to make room for the new stuff he will be getting for Christmas but kept his zebra out. I didn't expect him to enjoy it as much as he has. Its one of the few toys he got last year he still seems to enjoy and didn't out grow.
3,zebra bouncer,We bought this toy when our son turned 1. He is very tall for his age and could not reach the floor with his feet when he was on it. I would say this toy is better for an 18 month old and older. Now that he can use it he plays with it sometimes but not nearly as much as I had hoped. He certainly likes other toys better. I would say this is not a terrible toy but not the best either.
3,nice toy but not as I thought it would be!!,I bought this toy for my 15 month old and 2 year old. My 15 month old can't reach the base and keeps sliding off so I have to hold him. My 2 year old can only spin because he doesn't have enough muscle strength to bounce himself. It doesn't play music or make noise when it bounces either. I think the toy was a great idea but could use a few adjustments. I do like it which is why I gave it a 3 and not a lower score.
3,bouncy toy,My grandson was too big for the product when purchased. The package info was incorrect for his size and age. He was already too big for it and even on the highest setting he wasnt able to bounce. had to send back. was adorable though.
4,So much fun!,"My daughter has a huge smile when she jumps on this toy. It has a great volume control and is made very well. She doesn't play with it often which is disappointing. So I hope she will want to play on it as she gets a little older. Overall, a very fun toy but, pretty pricey"
5,Fun Buy,"My 18 month niece loves this toy! She enjoys it, and I enjoy watching her enjoy it. Great buy!"
5,great toy,"This toy is lots of fun, allows children to spin and bounce to their hearts content. This toy needs close supervision with children under 2 year of age.Toy is well-made,durable and very colorful.It was easy to assemble."
3,Could be Better,"Our 20 month old daughter just received this as a Christmas gift. I will say it is VERY sturdy, BUT to say it's good for children 12-36 months is pushing it. At 20 months my daughter looks border line big for it and she is only entertained for a minute or two while she is on it. I think if the toy had a spring to allow children to rock it from front to back (as you see on some playground horses/zebras) it may be a little more exciting for the little ones. Bottom line, I thought our daughter would love this (she loves bouncing on balls while we hold her hands)and she could take it or leave it."
5,21 month old LOVES!,"I'd been wanting to buy this toy for my son for a very long time. I found one today at a yard sale for $10 and he LOVES it! He bounces, laughs and has so much fun! So glad I was finally able to get one! He loved his jumparoo that he had when he was little and now he enjoys this just as much! He will be on it and then get off, look at it and has to get right back on again. The music, horse and galloping sounds it makes to so cute too!"
5,Great,"My daughter loves this thing, she got it for christmas and she has used it every day since. It is great, she laughs so much and the music isn't too annoying like some of her other toys."
3,Great toy!,"My son loves playing the music on this toy. The colors are great, & he loves zebras. He doesn't really use it for long time periods yet, but he just turned a year & his feet don't both touch the ground on either side of the toy yet. I'm hoping he'll use it more as he grows. It's very cute!"
5,Too Much Fun,I bought this for my Grand daughter EmmaClaire's 1rst birthday. She absolutely loves it. She can climb on and off it without any problem and plays with it off and on all day. Now her favorite thing is to take a magazine on it with her and she sits and bounces while reading a magazine. So advanced!!! I would highly recommend it.
4,Yee Haw,"This was purchased as a 1st birthday present. I love the fact that even though my one year old is short, he can get on and off by himself. I wish the toy rocked nd forth a little, but the bouncing up and down is SUPER fun when mom and dad help. The music is adjustable in volume which I love, and the lights and sounds keep him busy for moments. It's not a long term attention grabber and this point, but he does really enjoy the independance of getting up and down on his own."
5,My 17 Month Old Loves It,"My daughter is not the type to really sit down and play. She is way to active. But with this toy she goes on herself and will have a good 'ole time for 10-15 mins than of course goes to something else. But this is really the only toy that keeps her interested. It's a well made toy. She hasn't fallen off (which was one of my concerns when she received it as a gift) and loves the sounds, lights everything."
5,FP Go Baby Go Zebra,"I got this for our 15-month old daughter for Christmas. Once I got it put together, she got on and bounced for a few minutes. She gets on and off but she loves playing with it. She laughs hysterically while she bounces. She had no problems learning to spin it either. The volume on it is good too. It has 2 levels so it's not loud.Fisher-Price Go Baby Go! Bounce & Spin ZebraI would definitely recommend this to others. Too bad it wasn't out yet when our son was her age."
5,It's a hit!,"We bought the zebra bounce and spin for our 1 yr old. Although she is small for her age and cannot actually climb on it herself, my husband and I put her on and bounce and spin her around. She loves it. She does not want to get off. Our 3 yr old loves it too and she loves the spin effect. We had originally wanted to get a rocking horse but because of the price and shipping it was way too expensive so we bought the zebra instead. We are so glad we did! We got a great price and super saver shipping. I recommend this toy for your active little ones!"
5,Best Toy Ever,"My grandkids adored this toy ! It was difficult to peel them off it ! It did take a little while for the 'shorter' children to get the full effect (feet-on-the-ground spinning motion), but when they did -- look out !"
3,"Nice toy, but not all that","When I first saw this Zebra, I just had to have it for my daughter. I gave it to her for her 1st birthday. She started really interacting with it around 14-15 months. It does not seem to be her favorite toy, but she does like to make it light up and make noise. She likes her stationary rocking horse better. Looking back I am not sure I would buy it again."
2,Meh,"We gave this to our 18-month old boy for Christmas. The irritating music made him cry. Even with the sound off, he is rather ambivalent about this toy. I have put it in the garage, and will try to bring it out in a few months and see what he thinks when it is ""new"" to him again."
2,Just ok,"I gave this to my 17 month old for Xmas because he's been really into ride on toys. This has been received just ok. He gets on it and jumps for 1-3 minutes but that's it. It just not that exciting I guess. It bounces up and down fairly slightly (not a huge amount of bounce), and swivels when it's being sat on. When it is moving in some direction or another, it makes sounds and lights up. But isn't that engaging it seems."
5,Bounce & Spin Zebra,"This made quite a hit with my grandchildren. It was very sturdy and the children enjoyed it very much. As a matter of fact, they want me to buy a couple more so they can pretend they are racing each other."
4,Cuter than it looks,We bought this for our daughter at 15 months old. It was smaller than I expected and the music is kinda wierd. But it was very easy to assemble and to our surprise she hasn't fallen off it or hurt herself with it at all. She does push it around on our hardwood floors so I would recommend it for a carpeted surface but it is definetly cute. She doesn't use it as much as I had hoped but we will have another baby soon and eventually he will use it.
5,Gabriel's having fun,My grandon loves this toy he just turned 1 and loves to get on it. He bounces up and down and spins around. He is just starting to stand and this is just a wonderful item. The music on the handle bars makes him smile. Well worth the money. Would definitely buy this again for another grandchild.
4,Lots of fun,"I purchased this for my 11 month neice and she loved it. Once she figured out that if she jumped up and down that it also turned, she wouldn't stop laughing. And it was so easy to assemble."
3,Decent product but a bit expensive,"Was very easy to install. The only cons for this item I can think of are that it is a bit expensive and that to open the basket, the front side needs to be bent outwards and only then can the bottom hook go through."
4,HZ-930 Honeywell Tower heater,"This heater is great. Continually pumps out great heat, without timing out, overheating, and shutting off. I had been using a smaller space heater, that emitted blasts of heat, and would shut off every 4 minutes, whilst using tons of Energy. This unit uses the least amount of electricity, evidenced by my bill as well as the ability to run other appliances at the same time without flicker. I have left it on all night, with little or no concern of expense or danger. No complaints! Totally satisfied!"
2,Better heaters out there.,"Wow. this just came in the mail today and i've got to say I'm disappointed. First, it has no timer, no remote, just two settings: 1 and 2. das it. On. Off. Totally should have paid another ten bucks and gotten one that has some kind of settings or SOMETHING going on. Plus my hair dryer heats up the room faster in five minutes than this thing does in an hour. No bueno."
1,No Delivery,"As far as how good this product is I cannot say, for, after ordering one and waiting over two weeks for it to be shipped out I get a message in my e-mail indicating that my order has been canceled. This is following an e-mail I received a few days earlier saying:""We sincerely apologize for the delay of your order. All our orders are usually shipped within 24 hours, however there has been a delay from the manufacturer on the following product: Honeywell Carbon Tower HeaterWe will ship out your order as soon as we receive shipment. The shipping department will provide you with tracking information via email.Thank you for your patience and understanding and for providing us with the opportunity to be of service to you.""So based on the failure of the order being completed I am going to have to give an unsatisfactory grade on this product."
1,Good Riddance,"I had great expectations based on the good reviews, but when I received it, the lower heat setting gave off less heat than a 100 watt light bulb, could not warm up a small room. The high setting was better, but it stopped working after only one day, Did anyone mention it was made in China? I think I would have paid more attention to the bad reviews if I had known that.It took me a half day off work to deal with customer service (Today's Concept -- polite enough, but only open during most people's working hours) battle with FedeX, then finally take it to UPS and pay $16 to return a defective product. This was not a good experience."
1,"Terrible Quality, Terrible Product","I ordered one of these for my studio, it has 4 and 5 star reviews on Amazon so I thought I had chosen a winner.It is very light weight (plastic top and base) doesn't put out much heat and stopped working completely after only 3 days.I cannot recommend this product on any level.At the time I purchased it it was around $49.00, the price has gone up to $99.00, not worth it at $40.00 really not worth it at $99.00.Don't waste your money on this product."
3,Not as much heat as I expected,"PRO's: quiet, uses less energy than many space heaters (375 w on low, 900 w on high, vs 1500 w for many heaters), as a radiant heater it provides heat quickly and it doesn't waste energy heating up the whole room when all I really care about it being warmer myself.CON's: just dones't provide quite enough heat. I really have to be within 2 or 3 ft of the heater to feel significant warmth, even on the high setting. Since the manufacturer warns you not to have stuff within 3 feet of the front of the heater, you basically must be within the non-reommended zone to get warm."
5,Best heater on the market (If you can find one),"My dad bought this heater in 2007 to heat his small living room, Quiet and effective this heater was by far the best on the market at the time. low power consumption and great heat you cant go wrong if you can find one( not sold anymore). I now have this heater and it works as good as it did 4 years ago. If I could give it 10 stars I would. Cat loves it and so do I.10 stars for an outstanding product."
5,This heater is awesome!,We also have the smaller version (HZ910)of this heater & wanted an additional heater for a very large sunroom during the winter. Both are Honeywell heaters & provide a wonderful sunlike warm heat. They are also SILENT! Before getting this heater I had had to return at least 8 different heaters to various stores because all they did was make noise.We all love this heater! I can't say enough about how good the warmth makes you feel... like you're laying in the sun...not a heater just blowing hot air on you! The seller I got it from was awesome too!
2,"5 Star Performance, 2 Star Reliability","Had previously ordered one of these heaters in early 2007. Worked well at warming our kitchen and not eating up the kilowatts. Turned it back on in Nov. 2007 and it worked fine until Feb. 2008 when it just stopped working. Ordered two more in Feb. 2008 (1 for home & 1 for office). They arrived the next day. The one we kept at home is still going strong. The one that we took into the office stopped working two weeks ago. E-mailed Amazon who forwarded my message to the marketplace vendor. Did hear from them within two days, but have had the flu and haven't gotten back to them to see what sort of exchange can be worked out. These heaters work wonderfully, when they are working. They don't eat up the electric like most of the other plug-ins on the market, and the heat is much more comfortable. If they can get the longevity issue under control, then it's 5 stars from me. Will follow-up when I see how the replacement issue is taken care of."
5,most silent heater,I am very pleased with this towerheater.It is very silent and doesn't use so much energie--------and of course it heats well.
3,A very enjoyable book concerning the Italian front '43-'44,"The author was a British officer in the Med during WW2 and tells the tale of Italy during late 1943 through 1944, primarily focusing on Rome, Anzio and Cassino. The author tells the story of the battle for Italy by telling the story of a variety of individuals and weaving them in amongst official records. The story is played out from an Irish priest in the countryside, an FJ NCO at Anzio, a German DRK nurse in Rome, etc.. this might not entice some people, but IMO, gives some interesting insight - I really enjoyed the book, but not for the official history but for the real history."
2,"It does give you Math problems, but that's all","I did order the book for preparation in taking the Praxis Mathematic Content Knowledge Exam (0061). The book is all math problems and the answers were well understood. My main concern was that it is a good book to review Math problems, but not math concepts. The Praxis exam is very focus on understanding math concepts. The book does not do well in that category. It is a good foundation, but not the Rosetta Stone I was looking for."
4,I THINK this is a good product,I am still not quite sure of the dosing... the directions on the package differ from what I heard on Dr. Oz... so am experimenting. But I believe it does deepen the quality of my sleep.
3,Glycine,"Neither here nor there. Would need to do a long term, double blind, controlled study over decades to see if it works."
2,"Long on pages, but short on substance","If you have never seen or used a computer before, this book MIGHT help you...but I doubt it. While there are pages and topics galore, there is very little substance. In most cases, the author does little more than tell you how to access an item from the menu (ie: from the drop-down box select xxx -or- select the widget you want to include in the frammit and select ""save"" from the ""file"" menu. After reading this text, you will have an understanding of how to start programs, make your windows and menu bars multi-colored, and how to save documents...but little else. The only redeeming factor to this book is that it is available for $1.69 used - I pity the folks who paid full price."
5,revolutionary,"Kelly Bliss has written a book that finally addresses American values: self worth, self care, and a can do attitude. She uses her personal experience as a large person in the United States, one that I could relate to. I feel ready to take care of myself now."
1,Waste Of Money...Plus It's Overpriced!,"I was trying to find a decent dustless hand sander for drywall, since I do quite a bit of repair work for others and it can make quite a mess. This isn't it! The design is really poor. Ideally a tool like this should have a ""perforated"" plate with channels that allow the vacuum suction to do its thing with a drywall sanding screen. Instead, the plate is solid and Shop-Vac provides sandpaper sheets with the tool (and no screens), so the vacuum action is apparently supposed to work around the edges. Dust was still flying everywhere, since the sander wasn't effective. This ""dustless"" sander is getting returned for a refund."
1,Not worth a nickel,Tried it and I'm taking it back to the store. Tons of dust falls to the ground and it feels very awkward in the hand with it's rigid unpadded handle. It's just a very poor design with the solid backing on it. There seem to be much better designs on the market according to Amazon reviews so I'm going to try a highly rated one. Thy this one instead: http://www.amazon.com/MARSHALLTOWN-Premier-VS792-Vacuum-Sander/dp/B000VXBYPQ/ref=cm_cr-mr-title
1,really poor -- get the hyde,drops a lot of dustonly sucks from the sidestakes non standard size sheetswill returnbought the Hyde instead
3,Good idea but...,"I bought this to help ease dust when sanding. With the attached cord it does not manuever as freely as a regular sanding pad and the feel was a little awkward. I wound up instead trying to hold with my non-sanding hand the shop vac's regular hose near where I was sanding, but that also had mediocre results. It seems the best bet is to have a window fan to exhaust the dust outside the room, or get a good canister face mask and use with goggles."
3,Great Special Effects,"The special effects alone make this low budget movie worth seeing. Residents of central Illinois will get a kick out seeing the movie shot at ""home"" and based on a local legend. The plot is predictible but still fun to watch."
3,Good,"This movie is well done for a low budget movie based on Spoon River Anthology. Yeah sure, it could have been done with a set in Hollywood or where ever, but then it wouldn't have been as well done because of accuracy. Using Central Il, and the people from there makes it a close to home movie. I only give it 4 stars because it's low budget, however i think the movie it's self was excelent."
1,The suckiest movie ever made!,"This movie isn't even worth the one star I gave it. There was absolutely no plot and the acting was so bad I couldn't even watch the whole movie. All in all, don't waste your money."
1,Swill in the 1st degree,"During this film, I mostly laughed! But this was not supposed to be a comedy. I am not sure how a half cocked plot like this even gets the funding to be put on film. Keeping in mind that Ghost's is not a big budget movie, but a bargain bin cast in the back woods of Central Illinois... I still have a hard time giving it a break.Bad Acting, Poor Plot, plus some racial and social stereotyping that have to be seen to be believed. All contribute to making this film barely watchable. There were a few special effects that surprised me with good quality.If your favorite movies are in the Genre of ""Mystery Science Theatre"" fare... Then this is your movie. Otherwise, go rent Blaire Witch again, and see how far decent acting, and a good plot can take a low budget movie."
4,Good Ab Workout,"I really enjoy the Killer Abs workout. It is easy to follow and I like the circuits. For me, this ab workout was more enjoyable than Jillian's 6 Week 6 Pack workout."
2,Just Okay,I personally think the 6 week Six Pack by Jillian Michaels is better. I feel I get more of a core workout with it.
5,Jillian Michaels Killer Abs,"I think that if you are serious about working out and really want to get ripped then Jillian Michaels work outs are definately for you. Having said that, you will probably need to put in at least 3 hours a week to get the results you want. My boyfriend said recently, 'thank Jillian Michaels for giving my girlfried a fabulous body' - haha. :) and i am 53 years old so don't ever think you are too old for these workouts! Mind you i have always kept fit but Jillian's work outs always seem to take you that bit further. Killer abs baby!!!"
3,Killer Abs DVD,"This DVD is excellent when it works in my player! Sometime it does not come on and I have to keep putting it in and out. I did adjust my player for this type of DVD. I have had problems with other Jillian Michaels DVDs, maybe it is just my play who knows, but other dvds work fine. Other than playing problems when I can get this dvd to work it is an excellent excercise work out. Shipping and everything else was fine."
2,I feel scammed,"I am not in figure competition shape, nor fitness model shape, but I found most of these moves to be too easy. I know she says in other DVDs I have by her to ""use weights if its to easy!"" But I did, heavy ones too, and before I could feel a burn, the move was over! Soooo aggravating!!!! I have to literally pause the DVD and keep going for another minute and a half or so. Maybe I have a strong core, maybe I'm used to longer more intense exercise DVDs like Insanity or P90X, idk. But, as highly respected as she is in the fitness world, I expect to suffer and beg for mercy in the middle of the routine. I give it two stars because there were maybe 2-3 moves per level that made me burn, but thats not enough in my honest opinion."
5,Great Workout!,"Jillian delivers in a fresh and motivating routine! I was a little unsure when ordering this DVD. I use Jillian DVDs for 95% of my workouts, however, 6 week 6 pack (which is another Jillian Ab-focused DVD)was a let down for me in variety and effectiveness. Not the case for Killer Abs!!! The workouts are a great combination of fat burning cardio with focus on getting a lean and ripped midsection. This DVD does not disappoint!!"
2,It's just ok,"There are 3 workouts on this DVD. Level 1 is tough but do-able. Level 2 is also quite a challenge, but with some practice (or those people who are already in great shape) the workout is also do-able. However, level 3 is just crazy! Even the people I know who are in great shape would have a lot of trouble doing some of these exercises. Jillian moves very fast through them as well. I tired to go at my own pace but it was near impossible for me to do and now my back is killing me! I have Jillian's 6 Week 6 pack DVD and it is wonderful. If you want an ab DVD from her, go with that one, and skip this one."
1,Jillian's Killer Abs a Major Disappointment,"I, too, was excited (based on the previews) to receive this DVD. I work out with weights and aerobics 6 days a week and run 5 days a week, so I am no stranger to working out (Karen Voight, The Firm, Gin Miller). I also have done (and loved) many of Jillian's other workouts. This one sucks. Sorry to say. Poor (if even any) cuing, routines that are flashy but stupid, and ineffective. Possibly dangerous,too, as lots of her moves could cause injury. What the hell were you thinking, Jillian? I want my money back on this one."
5,Great gift.,"Got it for wifey actually. She's been following Jillian's workout on Youtube. She's been enjoying the workout on DVD, cuz now Jillian is on massive LED TV screen compared to the Laptop screen."
2,Killer Abs-a killer,"I love Jillian and have many of her dvds but I hated this one-level 1 &2 were blah-some moves too dull,others too uncoordinated-I plan to sell it"
4,STYLE,"IT GIVES YOU DIFFERENT ABS WORKOUT THAT YOU NORMALLY DONT HAVE SO JILLIAN MAKES IT FUN AND I HAVE BASICALLY ALL OF HER TAPES WHICH I JUST STARTED OVER A YEAR AGO EXERCISING, I AM 52 YRS OLD AND SHE MAKES ME WANT TO WORKOUT..."
4,A fun story for kids and adults to enjoy!,This story is cute and funny. A great book with humor that both kids and adults can enjoy!
3,Pictures are wonderful,"but the story is kind of cheesy. The point is well and good, but the ending is a little weak. You might want to look at a copy in your local library before purchasing and see if it is worth the pictures."
1,The worst movie EVER made!,"Looks like it was filmed with an old home video camera. The story is hard to follow, not that you will care after the first 5 minutes. The girls are hideous to look at, and not in a cool goth type of way.This movie literally looks like it was made by 6th graders or something. I can't believe a movie this cruddy actually got such a wide distribution. What a piece of garbage.There is not one redeeming aspect for this movie. Avoid at all costs!"
2,Cheap but poor support,"I bought this card because of the strong reviews and low price. Beware! The software support is abysmal; I cannot add new networks in the client manager, and when I tried to go online to get more up-to-date software, the downloaded 'updates' were non-functional. This is compounded by the fact that none of the 'read me' or online 'documentation' files actually have any instructions in them - they all just list the many updates made to the non-functioning software (""Chinese character support updated"")"
2,Interesting.,"I get the impression from this book is that the only the author has written before was his signature. While the story was very interesting it was quite poorly written.Read High St@kes, No Prisoners by Charles Ferguson instead."

4,Homecoming,I was thrilled to find and order the Haygood Hardy recording of The Homecoming. I have loved this music and looked for it for 30 years.My only complaint is that the recording time for the Homecoming on the CD is a little short. Would love to have a more lengthy version of the title song. Superb.
1,Not what I was looking for,I you liked Haggood Hardys's score to ANNE OF GREEN GABLES and would like something similar from him then get ALL MY BEST from him. Also nice from him are his piano tunes ALONE. Then this THE HOMECOMING CD here is not what you are looking for!
4,book is SPECIFIC to the praxis...,"This book seems to be advertised as good review for the CSET as well. WRONGO! Admittedly, it does have a few fun practice questions. Really though, its a very specific guide for the PRAXIS (the format of the test, the format for the constructed responses etc). The book contains little or no PE information. So dont rely on it for learning or review. This book will only help you gain familiarity and comfort with the format, and perhaps some understanding of expectations.Enjoy"
2,Not helpful at all.,"I found this book to not be helpful at all. The materials that I studied in this book were not on the test. I would not recommend buying this study guide, but if you do, please do not rely solely on this book helping you to pass the test. You will definitely need to buy other books and study guides."
4,"A little vague, but usable","I found the guide to be a little more vague than other study guides that I've purchased. The other guides included summarized chapters with the information. I was expecting more of the same from the ETS guide. It is basically an outline with example questions. To find it useful, you will need to purchase additional text or have a background in the subject. In that case, it would be very helful and I would increase the rating."
2,physical education and health study guide,This book is not helpful at all. The materials only cover 5% from what was in the test. I would not recommend buying this study guide.
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!,LIKE many other reviewers I found this book to be lacking in information specific to the HEALTH PRAXIS TEST. UNLIKE other PRAXIS study guides ( like the elementary one) it DOES NOT contain specific information. IT merely contains an outline of the info you need to know ESPECIALLY for the health section. I had to get most of my info from the internet and I am hoping that will be adequate. SINCE I HAVE BEEN OUT OF THE HEALTH EDUCATION FIELD FOR over 20 years I was looking for something that would help me review...THIS book was NOT IT!!!!!!! I hope I pass the test!!!!!
2,Boring,I really thought this book was very boring. It is very depressing as she talks about all the health problems/trials she has faced. Alot of the decor. tips are something only my grandmother would enjoy!
1,LIVING IN THE FIFTIES!,SAVE YOUR SELF DOSH AND THE PAIN OF READING THESE BOOKS THAT ARE FROM THE ERA OF LEAVE IT TO BEAVER AND BRADY BUNCH!SWEET BUT VERY UNREAL FOR TODAYS WORLD.S.WHITING
2,Culturally Outdated Collection of Lectures,"After reading the first 1/3 of this book, I nearly chucked it across the floor. President Kimballs makes some inflammatory, outdated points stating that not only women should stay at home with the children, but that when women work, it takes jobs away from able men. Another opinion he puts forward is that women should not study business or science in College, but should study ""useful"" subjects such as home ec or child development. Granted, the last 1/3 of the book is effectively power and I enjoyed the parts where he talked about faith. Beware though for the outdated sections of this book."
2,"1.5 stars, but I've seen worse.","The Plot: ""The frozen bodies at a cryogenic lab are revived after lightening strikes and turned into weird-looking zombies. "" Yeah so pretty much you could tell it was gonna be REALLY STUPID. Not as bad as 13th Child, Ghost Rig, Dark Universe, or Jack-O but the difference between this film and those, it that this one is cheezy so you can laugh at it. It's basically about this cryogenic lab that has many frozen customers already inside little capsules. One night during a power-outage and while it's raining two security guards decide to bring the capsules out in the open. As expected, they get struck by lightening and then become the undead, which end up looking more like green space aliens than anything else, and believe me they'll have you on the floor laughing. Rent if you want a good cheezy movie to laugh at."
1,The stay put pan,"I have never seen Pillsbury Crescent Rolls stick to anything before in all my days of cooking. The Airbake pans changed this. Not only were they burnt in 5 minutes less time than the directions, which we have used for years, showed but they were also each stuck firmly to the pans. Good thing however because when we opened the oven, the smoke detector went off so we had to run with the pan outside. Didn't lose our burnt crescent rolls however as they were stuck in place on the pan. What a great innovative product."
1,unsatisfyed with size of product and added shipping charges,"lack of product (size) discription,lent me to believe that it was the 14x16 size sheet pan and also the pizza pan is only 13 inch.and not a 16 inch. Also one big thing was shipping charge,I was told that one item would be here by the 24th and the other after so the shipping charge was cheeper because I had choosen the standard shipping rate so it was cheeper and not $24.91 other wise I would have NEVER HAVE ORDER IT !!!! So now I have to ship it back because of the over charge on shipping. Thanks..."
2,Not good for Specialty Cookies,"It is true that your cookies won't burn, but what I don't like is that all the cookies I make on this sheet flatten out into thin little cookies. On my old cookie sheets they hold their form and any fillings in the middle do not leak out like they do when I use this cookie sheet. Also when I go to remove the cookies from the sheet they just smush up like they aren't cooked enough. Overall I will only use this for baking pizzas and cookies that should be flat."
4,Best Ever Cookie Sheets,"I have used these cookie sheet,s for many years, They are the best cookie sheet,s i ever had. It is almost impossable to burn any thing on these, Plus nothing stick,s to them. Hope you continue to sell them, they are getting very hard to find any where else . Thank You"
1,Worst cookie sheets on the market,"AirBake cookie sheets are horrible. Yes, your cookies will be a perfect golden color, but they will stick to the cookie sheet. After making the standard chocolate chip cookies (made with lots of butter), I was distraught to find that they would not come off the AirBake cookie sheet. It was like they were glued to the surface! I could turn the cookie sheet upside down, shake it, and the cookies were still stuck. Now, I am left with dark circles that won't wash off, even after soaking the cookie sheet overnight. I will never again buy this brand, and the AirBake cookie sheet I currently own is going in the garbage."
1,Worst cookie sheets on the market,"Baking cookies on an AirBake cookie sheet may not end with burnt cookies, but it will end with all the cookies glued to it. The first time I used this product, the cookies (chocolate chip, made with lots of butter) stuck so bad that I could turn the cookie sheet upside down and shake it, and the cookies still would not come off. Cleaning was yet another issue- my AirBake cookie sheet still had cookie residue left behind even after hours of soaking. I've finally given up, and decided to throw it out. I now use Wilton cookie sheets- they are heavy duty, non-stick, and the best brand of bakeware on the market."
2,Takes too long and food sticks,"The past few batches of cookies I've made on these pans just didn't turn out well at all. There's definitely no problem with burning, but they just don't cook the cookies right - they'll be nice and brown all over, but when I take them out, they just flatten into a very ugly cookie, like the insides aren't cooked well or something. And my cookies stick, even when the recipe says to use an ungreased pan. I'm going to look into a different kind of pan."
5,cookie baker,"air bake are the best for cookies,always a great product, keep wife from scrubing off the non stick surface. very good product, would buy again"
5,I love it!,I love this! I just got it so I haven't used it extensivley yet. On my pizaa--It heated through and my pizza (crust) was great and crisp and not too doughy! But the rest was hot too. I can just tell it's gonna work great!It is a nice size! I would definitely order again!
1,terrible pans,I was only able to get 1 use out of these pans. I used a metal spatula to remove the cookies and ended up with metal shavings from the pans all over the cookies. The pans also warped in the oven so the center of the pan is about 2inches higher than the edges. The pans are useless now.
5,Never Go Back To Stainless,"After using these AirBake sheets, my cookie baking dreams were realized. No greasing the pan, no burning the cookies, no residual stains left on the sheet -- in other words, all the problems I had while using stainless steel cookie sheets (aka jelly-roll pans). They wipe clean with a damp paper towel when cooled. With the stainless, surface areas began to come off where something had become stuck to the pan. Bits of shiny metalic ""stuff"" would adhere to my cookies at times. Perhaps thats why parchment paper and silicone baking sheets have become so in vogue lately. With the AirBake, cookies literally slide off with the slightest push onto the cooking rack. I started out with one, but now have three AirBake pans in my pantry and sent the stainless ones to a rummage sale."
4,pretty cool for a direct to video thing.,with tons and tons of direct to video junk coming out every month i thought this was kind of cool. the cg that they can pull off these days with little budgets is amazing. i thought this movie was pretty entertaining for the most part. you gotta love the robots that just kill everything. if you want a goofy-action-robots-killing-people movie this one is for you. give it a shot. you can do lots worse.
2,"Can't shake that ""made for sci-fi"" channel feeling.","The story line itself is not entirely bad. A bit worn, but workable for a sci-fi flick. Tired old ""set 'em up, pick 'em off"" plot. And some awful acting. Awful to the point of funny. One girl, on the plane at the beginning, gripped by the machine's claw, frees herself, and then, with the machine not even touching her, she runs, jumps and throws herself on the floor in a heap. I keep thinking this must have been the setup act for a CGI scene that they forgot to do. It's hilarious.But the movie spends what seems about half it's entire length reiterating the same scene. Guys standing in front of the machine shooting at it with AR-15's. I mean, it doesn't work, and they continue to spend their entire time trying to shoot it with guns they know won't do the job.After the twentieth gun battle with two guys standing on front of the machine shooting at it, and the machine standing there unfazed, I'm yawning."
3,Open Skull And Extract Brain...,"Want to see Michael Dorn without his head-ridges? How about Robert Picardo in non-holographic form? Well, they're both right here in SHOCKWAVE! Dorn plays an army general and Picardo is a scientist in this Jim Wynorski cheeze-log. Luckily, Jim's a big fan of killer robots (and who isn't??), so SHOCKWAVE has two unstoppable, clanking metal marauders running amok. We also get a 5-man SEAL team, a trio of homicidal robbers, a chopper pilot, and a science babe to serve as robo-fodder. As added attractions, there's Bill Mumy (Lost In Space, Babylon 5),and Tim Thomerson (Trancers, Near Dark) in fairly useless cameos! Plus, George Tekei (Don't call him Sulu!) as an airline pilot. SHOCKWAVE is a watchable saturday afternoon time-annihilator... P.S.- My favorite part is when one of the robots hurls the head robber guy into a 6-ton boulder, and it wobbles! Priceless!..."
4,Better Sci-Fi Channel Better.,"An entertaining film with many cool tweaks and loads of defaults. The ci-Fi Channle has finaly released a ""decent"" film with just about average CGI and acting. better than any of thier other films. Fun war of the Worlds meets Terminator flick. The story is a downed plane crasheds on an island carrying two super smart war machines bent on leaving the island and causing major damage in a populated area. A team of Navy Seals are sent to stop the machines and return them to the project headquarters for reprograming. at the same time a group of bank robbers have crashed on the island to and are stranded with a half-working helicopter that the machines would very much like to repair and fly off the island with ther help of a branwashed scientist(Robert Picardo) to pilot it. In order to save countless lives the Navy Seals must find a way to stop the machines at all costs."
2,Pretty bad,"If you want to have some fun watch a movie called Curse of the Komodo which is Komodo 2 .It's about 3 casino robbers who crash their helicopter on an island full of giant komodo dragons.This movie was obviously made by the same company as they have 2 of the same actors in it and lifted the entire sub-plot and dialogue,sometimes word for word, from Curse of the Komodo.They just replaced Komodos with robots.I've never seen a non-remake scavenge a film like this.Komodo was much better with better acting.Anyways it's worth watching for the fun of it.Very low budget."
2,Good for a laugh,"One of the truely bad movies that you can have a few drinks and laugh at. Even better, get a few friends arround, a few more drinks and turn the volume down, each pick a charicter and supply the dialogue. Hours of fun!"
2,So bad it's good as camp,"After seeing the cast and all the Star Trek actors involved, I was shocked to see acting this bad. So bad it borders on hilarious. All this while a silver slinky robot with long legs searches out to destroy. This is one that could evolve to be a cult favourite, it's just that bad. Thought Robert Picardo was a good actor? Wait until you see this one!The best realised scenes are those of the secret military robots. If I was voting for hilarity I would give this a 5. There is a part of this where a plane crashes, and something breaks out on the plane, and insanity enuses. Keep in mind this is before Snakes on a Plane came out. Don't take this film seriously, but have fun with it."
1,Not a good case if you dock to speakers.,"I bought this attractive case from the TechNGnet (whom I can't rate low enough for their return and shipping policies) and immediately had a problem getting my 5G 80gb Ipod into it. It is a clumsy process to get your Ipod into and out of this case. I use inmotion speakers, so I need to remove my Ipod from its case to dock it. This case made this process more complicated than it needed to be.If you plan on never removing your Ipod from its case, this iSkin might be fine for you. If you're like me, ease of entry and exit overrule this product's good looks."
2,Content is great - printing and binding is not,"First off, the content of this book is top-notch. Calculus of Variations comes across as slightly magical when you first encounter it, but this book lucidly explains in thorough detail how and why you can extend calculus to functions of functions.That said, the binding of this book is really terrible. The cover--which is glued on--fell off after I opened the book 4 times! That is unacceptable, even for a book as inexpensive as this. The printing quality also isn't great, and some glyphs are difficult to discern, but it's not a huge deal compared to the cover falling off. Usually Dover books are better than that."
3,missing items,"In the product description it says that the item includes volume 3 and 4. But in my order I just received one volume, I dont think that its fair that as advertised, I expected both volumes and we are still missing volume 4"
5,Sailor Moon S Heart Collection II,"My fav. episode in this one was Retire from the Sailor Soldier!?Minako's Concerns. You learn a lot about Mina because you never really know she loves volleyball. But I loved Rei's episode. Everything you want to know about Rei and Chad is here. Sailor Mars and Venus are stars in this DVD. One of the most exciting things is that at the very end, you see Eugeal, but only her face shadow. It's really mysterious, and later you find out she's the most violent witch. I really do love this movie, and if I had a choice, I would give this 10 stars. This is probably my favorite movie!! If you notice this, Venus' Love Me Chain is the most used attack in the S Season. GET THIS 1!!"
4,Sailor Moon S Heart Collection ll Review,"Don't settle for less! Actually, this review is short and sweet. This second DVD has the same basic synopses as the first. The interactive menus provide layouts of Sailor Jupiter (which seems inappropriate for the disc). Maybe since there aren't any episodes about Lita in this collection, Pioneer figured they'd make it up to the fans by putting her info and pictures in. Oh well, that's my theory, because it seems to be this way for the entire series, except discs 1 and 3.ANYWAY...The sailor senshi/scouts seem to be keeping up with the Heart Snatchers and are finally gaining on them. Watch Serena's exiting 2-part birthday spectacular! It's a showdown full of laughter and drama.Collect the next Heart Collection now, and view these six uncut episodes! What else can I say? It's Sailor Moon; you'll love 'em!"
4,"Good, but not great.","Lemme tell you this, I love the Sailor Moon series. However, compaired to the OTHER discs in the series, this is the worst. The best, is either the 1st disc, or the 3rd. By all means, if you collect the DVD's... GET IT! But, if you only watch it now and then, I'd advise you NOT to get it. Oh well, I have the new Simpsons DVD I preordered and the new Heart Collection (Vols. 9-10) coming soon, which I cannot wait for."
4,Very good - if you put on the *japanese* track,"If you watch this DVD in japanese with english subtitles, it is excellent, and I would certainly give it 5 stars. The acting is well done and the story begins to unfold more in this volume. However, I only gave it 4 stars because of the english track. The acting and voices are terrible with one or two exceptions, but that isn't the main problem - the problem is that the english track is *NOT* uncut - scenes that were taken out are back in, however all the dialog changes such as Michiru and Haruka being cousins, the conversations that were completely changed around, the names, and all the stupid valley girl slang and such have not been changed to the correct dialog. Unless you are watching this with the japanese voices and english subtitles, you are still watching a heavily edited and far inferior Sailormoon. However, if you watch this with the japanese track, it's a really great buy and an enjoyable watch, especially if you're a Sailormoon fan."
5,Nice,"This is my second scoop, the other one was a bit small but both work great. If your looking for a scoop look no farther."
4,I liked it!,"I read this book first and now I'm trying to find the story of Luke. Flint was a hardened man. His life's work is to find the men who killed his mother and sister-in-law. He had no time for anything else, until he met Garnet. She is redheaded spitfire who could hold her own with wary, stubborn Flint. There are some funny scenes between them such as when Garnet shaves his beard to save his life, and he has the nerve to complain! The scene where she hits him over the head with a skillet cracked me up, even though I did feel a little sorry for Flint. I'm looking forward to reading the other novels in the series and now I'm an Ana Leigh fan. The author also includes some thoughts regarding pregnancy and drinking at the end of the book which I think was a special touch."
3,A disappointment.,"I enjoyed the ""luke"" story so went on to this one but was disappointed. Although some of the dialogue was cute, the story was sadly lacking. It didn't hold my interest and I would up skipping sections to get through it. Didn't think much of the heroine who was a little ""hot pants""."
3,Not the same as in TV,"I already have a disapointment with this new 2007 Voltron's DVD series. They removed all deaths, kicks in the nuts(by the princess), bloodsheds and then repeat scenes of people running to fill up the space. In the special features they show you the scenes (not the whole chapter) with a big CENOSRED square...so you never get to see the scenes as we did when kids.Another deal is the dialog. Many female voices are men pretending to be women, why not replace those lines with real ladies? Want to make it better?..thats the way to improve things the right way..my though.Anything else, not bad at all(special features). By the way, DO NOT spect the same chapter order, just in case."
5,A Must Own Dvd,"I am very glad that they are bringing the voltron dvds out faster and quicker but the only thing is the pricesome places sell the dvds for $20 now,but hey if you loved voltron as a kid you must own the whole collectionI dont like Power Rangers because in my mind they stole the ideas from voltron,well thats my opinion on thatwell i wish they would show a picture of it also that would hype of the exciment of having this dvd"
3,Not As Good As The Others....,"I love Voltron. Don't let the review title fool you. When I was a kid growing up in the 80s, Voltron was one of my favourite shows along with Real Ghostbusters, Filmation's Ghostbusters, Silverhawks, and Thundercats. The episodes in this final set were made when the show was so popular and everyone wanted more episodes. The studio had run out of episodes of the Japanese shows that they made Voltron from so they went to the people that had made the shows originally and hired them to make original Voltron episodes. Being made a bit after the other shows, these episodes aren't exactly as cool as the ones in the first four sets, but they're still Voltron. DEFINATELY better than the new show of Voltron that just came out. Don't even bother with the new series if you're a fan of the original."
2,Disappointed!,"Ordered this set as a Christmas gift--came quickly and packaged to prevent damage. But once opened and checked, the first disc was all scratched on the playing side. Sent back to Amazon with no problem but the replacement set had the same exact problem! Am awaiting this set now from another vendor and hoping there are no scratches on any of the discs."
2,Fun but its missing something,"The concept and gameplay is great in my opinion, but they took too many short cuts on the sound and graphics. Multiplayer is annoying if you use a router or have a firewall because it disconnects a lot. Nice game but it could have been ALOT better."
5,Great book for young girls,"It's odd that of all of Amelia Bloomer's accomplishments, from being a suffragette to an editor of a women's newspaper, her greatest attribution is the bloomer. But the tone of the book is very appropriate: being a proper lady is silly. And sometimes, you have to be a rebel to cause change."
1,You have to use TAPE!,"You have to use tape. Living in AZ, a sticky substance sitting in direct sunlight with extreme heat; enough said. Intregrity is lost!"
4,Presents the art of prestressed concrete bridges,"Presents the theory and gives guidelines for detailing of prestressed concrete bridges to achieve functionality, constructability, durability and aesthetics. The author writes from his experience with the design and construction of prestressed concrete bridges in Europe. Prestressed Concrete bridges are becoming increasingly popular in the United States and in fact, CALTRANS standard bridge type is a post tensioned box girder bridge.An engineer involved with the design and construction of bridges must refer to this book before embarking on his design or construction effort for some remarkable ideas."
1,Poor quality,"The case, which folds open to form the ""mountain"" is flimsy, and the tracks connect poorly with the mountain. The ""interactive roadway play area"" is virtually impossible to stay together for more than a minute (assuming one can actually get the tracks to connect with one another).Within minutes the boys grew frustrated with the set coming apart, so now play only with the bulldozer as a stand-a-lone toy.If you are considering buying this.... don't!"
2,"Too dated, too silly.","I guess in the 1920's a story like this would be exciting for young girls, but it doesnt hold up very well 80+ years later. The way the story is told requires that you completely suspend any inclinations toward disbelief -- it's just too contrived and too silly for modern readers."
4,A myster with a twist,This is the first book by Patricia Wentworth I have read. I enjoyed the mystery and was completly surprised by the twist in the end. I probably will purchased more of Wentworth's book if they are avaiable on Kindle Deal of the Day.
1,May I have my $1.99 back?,"I cannot believe that there is more than one Miss Silver Mystery. Who would want to read more of this type of drivel that another one would have been written? Thank goodness it was only $1.99 on Kindle. Totally unbelievable premise. I will say the first chapter captured your attention - but so downhill from there. I love historical mysteries and was so excited I might have found a new series to enjoy, but alas no such luck here."
5,Excellent book! Truly one of a kind....,"This is an extremely well written and highly informed text. Above all else, it is an *interesting* (even exciting!) read. As an instructor of philosophy and literature, I am quite familiar with the challenge of helping students see connections between characters, themes, ideas and the connections these have to their lives. 'Live the Myth!' deals with this challenge and does so in a clear, organized, and thorough way. It is a breath of fresh air. I highly recommend this text to my students and to anyone interested in the humanities. One need not be a classicist in order to find 'Live the Myth!' relevant and helpful. It is just as interesting and helpful to the lay person as it is to a seasoned classicist."
2,find another version if you can,"I bought this CD because of the recommendations already listed. What a mistake. Yes, the CD is longer than other versions. But that is because it is SLOWER than the others. The 1st movement: painfully too slow, the drums are too loud and distracting during the quiet parts, and the horn solos sounds different [in a bad way] from every other version I've heard of this symphony. There is also pronounced hiss and audience noise. These other reviewers raving about this CD don't know what they are talking about. I only bought this b/c I lost my 1994 remastered version by the Leningrad PO. My advice, either buy a remastered version of an old recording, or buy a new studio version."
5,An Engineering Triumph,"This recording of the Symphony no.11 by Dimitri Shostakovich isperfomed by Mstislav Rostropovich and the London SymphonyOrchestra. The performance is simply one of the best on CD.The engineering of the recording which is live and taken fromperformances done last year in London is a marvel to say theleast, the work has many soft and loud passages and they arecaptured brilliantly. The LSO shows itself to be an orchestrathat can handle any piece of muisc put before it. They andMaestro Rostropovich give what has to be one of the finestperfomances of this work to date. I should also mention that forthe money this is a High Definition recording. It will put youraudio system to the test. The music will if given a chance willspeak volumes and tell an important and dark story of Russianhistory. The events of the Year 1905."
3,Mini Lowepro Roller,"this bag is made well, excellent quality, however it really is mini.the larger version was better for my needs, but I would still recommend this product for someone with camera equiptment that is not too bulky."
5,Love K&N Products,Awesome in my hemi Ram 1500. I love the sound of the air intake and the performance improvement is noticable when I stick my foot in the gas.
5,Great Product,I have installed a half dozen of these in the past few years. Installation is so easy a person that can check their oil can do this. The biggest reason I keep using this item is the increased fuel efficiency. I have used this for 2 Hemi's and get a mile per gallon more.
5,K&N Air Filter,I purchased a K&N Air filter and not only was the price great...but delivery was even faster than expected
3,Kids love it; no value required,"This is essentially stills from the tv show, mounted with text and flaps. The flaps are big and easy for small hands to manipulate. The story is as simple as the show -- each tubby makes a mess, and the noo-noo (a vacuum cleaner with eyes) tidies up. There are only six or so page spreads. At the end, there is a center page pop up of the tubbies, affixed very poorly with a tiny bit of glue. Still, I think all children love these characters and the flaps will stay put."
5,The Greatest Kung Fu Film ever made,"Is that enough in the title? The choreography of this film, along with a tight screenplay, moving characters, plot twists, comedy, did I mention choreography? This is simply the best martial arts film ever made. Sammo should get more credit, because he's come out with AWESOME films and has yet to make his mark on mainstream America (Martial Law doesn't count, ""TV chews up genius"" <James Coburn>)Maybe with Soul Caliber, which he is directing, will put him over the top (if they do it right, meaning, let him handle ALL of the action sequences, from planning to camera work) Enough, I can't say enough about this film. I've had it since 1983, and I still watch it. The only film I've seen more is Enter the Dragon, and that's only because it was out longer. The Victim is by far the best martial arts film ever made, bar none."
4,A Hung Kam-Bo fight is a beautiful thing,"A Hung Kam-Bo choreographed fight is a beautiful thing. This early example, in which he directs and co-stars as well, is definitely a cut above the average martial arts film of the era; a bit more attention to story and character than usual plus, again, those astonishing martial dances."
5,"""IM SORRY BUT I AM ALSO A VICTIM!!""",ONE OF THE BEST KUNG FU FLICCS IVE EVER SEEN!! IF YOUR A COLLECTOR THEN OF COURSE U NEED TO HAVE THIS. IT HAS A PRETTY DAMN GOOD STORY TO GO ALONG WITH THE EXCELLENT KUNG FU. DVD QUALITY IS EXCELLENT...
4,"""The victim"" of the title is not the one we expected","A very good Sammo's film, clearly one of the best he directed and choregraphed in the late 70's (with ""Warriors two""). Great martial performance by the effortless charismatic Leung Kar-yan (who's supposed not to be a true martial artist !). Many of the themes were developped in Sammo's later films such as ""Pedicab driver"" (the story of Leung Kar-yan's wife has similarities with the charater of Fennie Yuen).""The victim"" of the title is not the one we expected."
3,not too bad,This book is small enough to fit in the pocket of my scrubs but it's a little heavy and is obvious.
3,C+| but acceptable,"I can use the dictionary, but there was one drawback: The printing is of a very light shade. A little hard to see. Not bad enough to reject or send back, but I would have liked darker print. No further problems."
3,Spelling Dictionary,I am somewhat disappointed in this book since I use it a lot and it doesn't have a lot of words that I was use to in a very old speller I had. Also the pages are glued in and are very easey to pull out. Would not buy this book again.
5,Spell: B A R G A I N,"The spelling dictionary is perfect for our needs. My husband is an unconfident speller. He has been asking me to be his spell-checker for years (long before computers) - but now, he can do it himself! It is easy to use and conveniently small.Correctly spelled words are listed alphabetically, with occasional brief definitions to distinguish synonyms, and other easily confused words. You have to have a basic idea of how the word is spelled to use this."
3,Nothing special,I have been taking for almost two months and have not really noticed a lot of affects. My energy seems to be better and I have seen an uptick in my libido.
2,I like only one movie out of the the three,I didn't recognize most of the charactersmay be some of the movie were not of my agesI should pick some more recent
5,Excellent book for parents and educators.,This book does an excellent job of describing family situations; and living with someone who has down syndrome. It is realistic regarding the likes and dislikes of Rachel; the struggles; as well as the happy times the family goes through together. Although the reading level is on the 4-8 year old level; adults will also enjoy reading this book aloud to others or to themselves. As a special education teacher; I have read this book to all of my classes and they enjoyed it. My own children were enthralled by the book. I would recommend reading this book . It will be one that you will read over and over again.
1,take God out of it,"I found the reference to God unnecessary. Many people don't believe in God or don't want to get into the ethics of God making disabilities happen, with their children who read the book. It should have been left out. The scientific aspect was good but there are many other books that do a better job. Steer clear of this one-it was more of a parent trying to make come to terms with his own issues than a resource for a child."
5,Light but heavy,This is not a flimsy light weight sweatshirt. Rather it has a nice weight to it but will keep you warmer than a normal fleece. Nice quality!
4,One of Woody's Best,"This CD is one of Woody Herman's best. It features great arrangements and great performances including a very good vocal by Woody on ""This Can't Be Love."" I saw the Herman Herd a bunch of times and this CD captures the excitement and quality of the band."
3,"So, you like BG I & II...?","Then maybe you shouldn't consider playing this game. Though I suppose that would depend upon what elements you liked about them. To be fair, I haven't finished Icewind Dale I or II. Of course, there's a reason.You have a six member party. You don't get to pick those party members up through interactions or interesting story lines. You have to create them yourself. If you think fighting is the most fun, engaging, and important part of an RPG, maybe it won't matter to you. Sidequests? Nonexistent. Towns are not a central feature. Like an even less fun Dungeon Siege, maybe."
5,"Wonderful description, plot play, and character development","Jury is wonderful in his ability to find the smallest things in a person that tells what they are about. Writing this type of character is ingenious. The descriptions are rich and fulilling, yet are not pompous. The plot moves so well and is so hidden that I can not 'figure it out"" before the characters and that is refreshing and thought prevoking."
3,Great idea... for someone else.,"This strap is good quality- strong & well made with nice finished edges and quick release buckles, comfortable neoprene of adequate width... just not for me. I prefer my camera snug up high, closer to my head than this strap allows. Even adjusted all the way up, it left my camera sitting in my lap which just isnt comfortable for me -- might be perfect for someone taller or who wants camera hanging further down."
5,THIS MOVIE HITS YOU IN THE HEART,I BELIEVE THIS IS AN OBSCURE MOVIE BUT I HAPPENED TO SEEIT ON THE OLDIES MOVIE CHANNEL. I LOVE IT. IT'S ALLABOUT THE USUAL JUNKIES BUT WITH A TWIST. I JUSTLOVE HOLIDAY-THAT'S THE NAME OF THE PRINCIPLECHARACTER. HE HAS A BIG HEART EVEN THOUGHT HE'SPART OF THE BAD NEIGHBORHOOD. I GIVE IT 5 STARS.
5,Go Ving,"When I got this movie I had just lost my best friend. I was in a deep funk, watching this movie gave me the good cleansing cry that I needed to move on. Ving as Holiday Heart is so moving. Very few men can play a drag queen and make it realistic. Ving pulls it off with style and grace and total believeability. Not since Rupaul has a drag queen had so much class and style. Alfre Woodard as the drug addicted mother was a moving performance that she should get an Academy Award for. I thought the daughter was a bit obvious though. Her acting was not the best. But she's new and hopefully as time goes on she'll improve. Buy this movie you will not be disappointed."
4,An excellent movie.,"Ving Rhames in full makeup and costume at first seemed totally unbelievable, but his handling of the character is a testament to Ving's acting skills. While in drag at their female impersonator nightclub, all disbelief was suspended as they sang their way through their girl-group Supremes repretoire. Worth watching again just to catch their act!"
3,Worth watching. Ving Rhames must have really needed the money though...,"I can't say this movie would win any awards, but it was worth watching. I had much higher expectations based on the rating here and a friend's recommendation. First I have to say that Ving Rhames must have REALLY needed the money. As an actor, this movie was below his talent. I used to think that Wesley Snipes made a hard to believe drag queen, but poor Ving Rhames makes a train wreck of a drag queen. Anyway, the story was a good idea, just poorly carried out. I don't even know where to start... I like Alfre Woodard but not in this. The little girl is a good little actress and is enjoyable in her character. The homophobic, drug dealer, club owner turning into a caring father figure and friend to Holiday is never going to happen... I don't know, the movie was pretty bad, but slightly cute... It's just so out there in the believability factor... don't expect to be too entertained..."
5,A very strong stand,I bought this to use with my Fender Starcaster TT-1. It's very stable and well constructed. You can adjust the height and the angle of the basket. For this kind of use it's perfect to me.
4,nice solid snare stand,"Can't complain. Big improvement over basic flimsy stand I was using before. Stage tested; doesn't move, locks in position well."
3,Thin,"This is a thin, student grade stand. It was perfect for what I needed it for, but would not work well with a road kit as it is far too thin and light."
3,Not too gourmet,"While I had great hopes for this book - I was disappointed when it arrived. The recipes are generally quick and easy but hardly gourmet. Most are very common and appear in many other cookbooks and publications. As a cookbook collector and avid cook, I look for unusual recipes or the use of unusual ingredients/combinations. None in here. While this might be good for beginning cooks - not enough to interest me."
4,The Better of the two volumes,"This is the better of the two collections of Fatty and Buster.Although most of thee films are two-relers with one reel worth of good material, much of this is good for a laugh (if a bit brutal).You'll howl at the bit in ""The Rough House"" where Fatty nonchalantly trieds to put out a fire (that he straterd while smoking in bed)with a smal cup of water. I Love it! ""Back Stage"" (a possible relation to the 1923 Our Gang comedy of the same name, as some gags and the overall subject matter are similar) is great with the wild dancing of Jack Coogan (Jackie's dad) and a howl-larius scene where Buster and Al St. John wildly fight the stage bully. ""Coney Island"", despite the story that goes off into wild directions, is priceless for its footage of sections of the amusement park that no longer exist.A great representation of silent comedy overall. The Fat man cometh."
4,good product,"Needed some screening, bought this and it was a good product. A screen is a screen, it was a good price, and good service from seller"
3,Large variation in time/resources required,"While the majority of the problems presented in this book were quite usable in a five minute time block, several others were either much too easy, or required much more time than five minutes. It is important to read each problem carefully and determine how much time you wish to provide for the students. Some can be solved in less than a minute, while others could require more than one class period [I skipped those!] Also, several ask the students to use the Internet; not a feasible option for the purpose of this book. In the end, since I didn't use a problem every day of the year, I was able to find a usable problem for each day. Also, I did find a few errors in the key, so check each answer before assigning the problem to your students."
3,Does the job,"I thought I had bought the similar version with the remote. This one is not the one with the remote...I can't figure out how the temperature works, but this kicks out a lot of heat. Overall, okay I purchased the product but the shipping was a whopping $10. Hard to find, so I paid it.Anyway, heater works well, oscillates, and does the job for cold feet in the winter."
1,Absolutely horrible toaster,"This toaster is so bad that I actually searched out a place to review it. It is unbelievably bad, it can't consistently toast TOAST! You toast the same type of bread 3 times on the same setting and you will get three completely different results; one piece will be burnt, one will be completely untoasted, and it's anyone's guess what will happen to the third. I JUST got done making some toast and this thing pushed me over the edge and I felt compelled to warn other innocent folks from buying this P.O.S."
2,Cool Looking with a Short Lifespan,I bought this because it looked cool. It toasted reasonably well and I liked the frozen option. With two adults and light use it didn't even last a year. I'm disappointed and won't buy another one.
2,Uneven Toast,"I bought this because the last toaster only toasted on one side. This one does slightly better, but overall it produces uneven toast. I am looking for another one now."
1,Dangerous Product,"Too bad they do not have negative stars , this would rate it. I had this toaster replaced under warranty it still cost me the shipping to get it repaired. The ""repaired"" toaster failed again same problem. The circuit board inside toaster burns up and the heating elements stay on indefinitely. A huge fire hazard."
1,Terrible - unpredictable settings,"Inconsistent and unpredictable toasting on ANY of the settings. It's a gamble every time we try to toast (room temp or frozen) bread, bagels, waffles, or our coveted Poptarts. Sadly, we've burned enough food to feed a small nation. You pretty much have to monitor the entire toasting process. We strive for a medium golden ""toast"" result; not too light or dark. The middle setting barely produces a very light toast so we toast it a second time on the lowest setting and if we don't watch it and pop it up every 10 seconds to check, the toast is burned! We've experimented with the entire range of settings. The only consistency we get is BURNED food! Don't waste your money!"
1,A waste of electricity,"I don't ask much from a toaster. Mostly, I want to be able to put bread in it, and then have this bread emerge at some point in the not too distant future as toast.This machine doesn't do that. At any setting below the maximum, what it produces is more akin to stale bread than to what I'd call toast.Turn it up to the highest setting, and one side of the bread comes out reasonably, if unevenly, toasted, in a way that reminds me of the tan on my wife's feet after a summer of wearing sandals with straps in unexpected places.The other side is quite charred.Not really what I was going for."
3,my second item,"it's our second one of the same kind. the first one lasted for over a year. one day, i heard a pop and saw a spark in the ""slot"" area. that was the end of it.i bought the same one - a few weeks ago since i like the look and size of it in our kitchen counter. so, if i have a bigger item to heat up or toast i just use the oven. otherwise, it does it's job. for people who want their toasts even; this toaster is not the one you are looking for. i guess, the maker/manufacturer can rethink the lifetime and the even/consistent toasting."
1,Zero Stars,"I though I had just gotten a lemon until I read all the reviews. This toaster was a xmas gift to replace our ""ugly toaster"" that worked fine. The taoster worked for, I mean attempted to work when I pulled it out of the box. It was very unconsistant and would burn toast on the light setting and not cook on the max setting. The final straw was when the various buttons quit working a mere 1 week after getting it. I took it outside and smashed it to pieces I was so mad. I tried 0 stars because that is what this product deserved, but amazon would not let me."
2,Looks great on the counter but.....,I bought this toaster because of it's looks. I wanted something I could leave out that would look ok. I had it for about 5 months before it broke. The toast will no longer pop up. You have to unplug it to get the toast up. I would not buy this toaster again no matter how great it looks on my counter.
1,Horrible toaster. BUYER BEWARE!,"This product looks good, but toasts horribly. It does not toast consistantly. One batch of toast may be fine, the next batch may be too dark or not toasted at all. The best toaster I ever had was a Cusinart. It cost more, but to me it is worth it."
4,Pretty Fancy Not sure what all the buttons do,"Purchased the brushed stainless version [..]. It definitely looks nice on the counter. Other colors available were white and red. I am not sure what the warm or bagel buttons do but I haven't spent a lot of time pushing these buttons. You might find the blue led button, which is always on a bit annoying. It does toast unevenly. The inside elements brown more than the outside elements. I don't mind the uneven toasting that much. Crumb catcher works seems good at keeping crumbs off the counter.Update 6/1/09 Toaster still working, still happy. Top Blue button burned out about a year ago."
1,Will Make a Good Helmet,Loved the looks. It just quit working. Husband took it apart to find a burned up circuit board. He's going to make a helmet out of it for Halloween.
1,Up in Smoke,"After my college-age daughter took my still well-performing 23-year-old toaster to school, I fell for this new Oster toaster's good looks. I got the gleaming copper version at Target. It worked fine for 9 months & then scorched our toast & our curtains when it refused to ""pop up"" a slice of toast. The ""Cancel"" button would not work either & we had to yank the cord from the electrical outlet to stop it from further burning the toast. Acrid smelling smoke filled the kitchen. Oily soot covered much of the walls & kitchen cupboards. We're lucky it didn't burn the house down! Do NOT buy!"
5,A great play no matter how old it is,"Being a huge fan of the Alien and Predator franchises, I jumped at teh chance to play this game.. I must say, they dont make em like they used to. You can play as either an Alien, livng trough all the life cycles of Giger's monster that is a perfect killing machine. Or you can play as a Predator, the samuri-esque ingalactic hunter whose alien weaponry and high tech healing and vision modses make it neof the most lethal creatures in the game. And finally you can play as a Colonial Marine, made famous in James Cameron's classic Aliens. With the role comes a wide variety of high tech weapons, including the M$A Pulse Rifle and the Smart Gun LMG. All in all this also a scary game, with enviroments and sounds that will make you jump right outta you game chair. Its hard to find and probably expensive but its worth it, as this game freaking rocks. If your a fan or the franchises and comic books buy this and enjoy it."
2,Biz Talk -1,"I personally am not so enamored with Biz Talk-1. Sure, there is some useful slang inside, but the conversations presented are so chock-full of slang that they are not realistic. They also use some slang that is not commonly heard."
3,Style Over Substance,"After reading the other reviews of this book, I found it to be a disappointment. The book does a good job of teaching about how to design a DVD. Unfortunately, it does a poor job of teaching the Adobe Encore software. It does cover the design process using Encore but has very little about how to use the program itself. It is a matter of style over substance.As a manual for designing typography, this book would compete with anything that teaches Pagemaker. You will learn all about the history and use of fonts. As a manual for the overall design process for DVDs, it does a good job conceptually. I just wish it would have actually taught the program.In all fairness, this book does get around to Encore, halfway through but the coverage is fairly superficial.Its been a disappointment and I find myself needing to search for another tutorial."
5,"Design, Desgin, Design!","This book is about Designing. I LOVE IT.So many DVD books deal with the dry and techincal aspect of creating a DVD, which, don't get me wrong, is important.But a DVD is sooooo much more than how the bits and bytes get distributed on the disc.A lot of my customers don't realize that when they ask me to create a DVD for them they are really asking for me to do do the equivilent of creating a small website. In fact done right, the design for the two could be interchangeable.It's really nice to see sections on typography and color in this book.Kudos!"
5,Very nice!,"I bought these cuff links to wear to a meeting--they are splendid. The blue stone catches the light and becomes a bright, brilliant color! These cuff links look great with a cassock (anteri, zostiko, raso, etc)."
3,All about language disorders caused by stroke,"The author, a speech therapist, discusses in great detail the ""big three"" communication disorders caused by stroke: aphasia, apraxia and dysarthria as well as the ramifications of these disabilities for the patient. Technical terms are explained in detail so that the non-medical person can understand them. The psychological aspects of language loss are discussed in terms of the patient's anxiety, depression and acceptance of unwanted change. Speech rehabilitation is covered and the book has typical questions and answers a reader might ask following the last chapter. Resources such as web sites, support groups, etc. are also included. The book may be overly detailed for some readers. I was disappointed that the author dealt primarily with the stroke patient's survival without addressing how the family could survive the often devastating effects of language disability or loss."
4,Just a blast to from the past.,I read this when I was 14 years old and remember a scrapbook I kept. It was curiousity that drove me to buy this book again.
1,not so brite,"I bought the PK20 and it was delivered on Tuesday. The image quality was so bad I had to turn off all the lights in the room and shut the blinds and the image was still a bit washed out. 25 Lumins. Yep. ""> The PK20 is a pocket projector has a brightness of 25 ANSI lumens only."". This was a quote from a Mutsubishi tech. I'm sure it has some use, I just can't think of any.Oh ya, it's being returned as I type this."
1,Mitsubishi PK20 Pocket Projector,"Just far too few lumens for room use. May be helpful for desktop use, but then you have to carry a portable desktop screen. I returned it."
5,"A great, and inredibly portable machine",I bought this projector a while back and have had NO problems with it; the picture quality is amazing for such a small device. The best thing about this projector is how compact it is; perfect for someone on the go and incredibly easy to use. I would highly recommend this projector to anyone in the market.
3,Very handy but handicapped...,"This portable projector has proven itself extremely handy for small group presentations in small confined spaces. I have used it with the PC for Powerpoint presentations, with the DVD player and even tried it out with home theater equipment. It isn't quoted as one of the most luminous projectors, obviously. Perhaps the trade-off is with its portability. If that's what you want, this is it! If you need light, because you do your presentations in semi-dark environments, you will need a stronger projector.Looking back, I should have bought something less portable but with more power for the same price, since I do a lot of classroom work."
4,Wonderful projector,This is a cool little projector.. I have it since 2 weeks now..It has all the features of a huge bulky projectors.. the best part is it's size.. it does not look like a projector it is so small. It has the latest technology the LED bulbs.. no need to change the bulb often as conventional projectors. the downside is that it cannot be used in a bright lit room. However when the projector is placed at 10 degrees .. the image looks stretched on top and squeezed at bottom..I am not able to make it a proper rectangle. Over all I am happy with this product.
4,Great resource for the home bartender,"This is an excellent guide to the art of mixology and setting up a home bar. It shares the same features as ""Ultimate A-to-Z Bar Guide"" such as the alphabetical format which I find very useful and convenient as quick reference at the bar; and the appended listing of drinks following certain typologies - a great help finding the right drink appropriate to the occasion or what one has in stock. The presentation and layout however is more appealing and inspires neophytes like me to explore more the diverse world of wine and spirits. It is an alternative but will not replace the ""Ultimate A-to-Z Bar Guide."""
4,YUMMMMM!,The pan works great and the mix is delish! Love those dutch babies! I've ordered the mix twice from Amazon so far. Reason for 4 stars is because of shipping on the mix.
4,Dutch Baby,"The pan worked great for my Dutch Baby pancakes. I did use a plastic utensil to remove it from the pan and it still got scratched my first time out. Be careful, the pan coating isn't extremely tough."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased two of these pans about a year ago. Used them about half a dozen times, and both have started flaking off their non-stick coating. I have only washed them by hand, never used a metal utensil on them, and have stored them separately with protective padding in between. Norpro will only replace and will not give a refund. Won't buy this brand again."
4,An Informative Travel Video,"Taking on all of Scandinavia in one video is a bit presumptious, but this one manages with a combination of ""must see"" and ""seldom seen"" scenes. It is a welcome relief from the usual ""look at me in Scandinavia"" approach. Very useful train travel information is sprinkled throughout, and especially in the introduction and epilogue"
3,Smaller than expected,I purchased this thinking it was about the size of a real smurf ( an apple high) but it's more like something that would fit on a keychain. It's hard plastic and durable and maybe I should have checked the size a little better.
4,Diver Smurf,What's not to like? We can take Mr Smurf diving and he poses for pictures underwater with us! Such detail on a 2 inch toy!
2,A bit complicated,"I bought this loom to have a craft project to work on with my granddaughters. It's more complicated than any of us suspected. We haven't really enjoyed it as I thought we would. SO, it sits, unused, for the most part. I mean, it is there if we should want to try it but it takes too long to just get into in one weekend."
1,There are better ways to learn Native American Beading.,"I really get frustrated by products that say ""Native American"" and they are not even made in the U.S. There are better ways to learn many of the techniques used by real Native Americans."
3,same gusto material as 14 greatest hits,this is the same material that gusto put out in 1978.this is not the grass roots but ex-singer rob grill singing with studio musicians.if they had brought in the grass roots touring band it would have been better. it helps to work with people you know.buy the originals.
1,DID NOT FIT!,I finally was able to install my new oil cap and to my dismay it did not fit. If sure would be nice if you got things right!
3,Good Debut,"I liked this book, though I'm not quite sure why -- I found the story to be very confusing in places, and a number of things didn't make any sense. But the characters seemed likable and well-developed (particularly Oh), so it was an enjoyable read."
3,Pleasant read,"Since I enjoy antiques, I enjoyed the occasional tips in this and other Fiffer books. Rather like an American Lovejoy, but not as bloody. This is a pleasant read, well structured."
5,"Waiting for the next book of ""stuff""","I absolutely could not put this book down! Also just finished reading Ms.Fiffer's other book, ""Dead Guy's Stuff"" and wish I had yet another to look forward to! I lived in Chicago most of my life, an hour's drive from Kankakee; my aunt and uncle also owned a tavern 15 minutes' drive from Kankakee & were into antiques as well...spent much of my childhood visiting them in Momence,IL and these novels helped me relive a great childhood. Have always been interested in ""picking"" & would highly recommend Ms.Fiffer's novels to everyone who loves the ""hunt""!These books are well-written ... you will totally forget all YOUR problems as you will become involved with all the characters!Terrific!"
2,a little concerning,"I found some of the attitudes and advice in this book a little concerning. However, that's a personal opinion on how horses should be handled.The advice on trimming and shoeing was not as clearly written or well illustrated as some of the other books - try David Krolick's book for an excellent starter."
2,The Complete Horseshoeing Guide second edition by Robt. Wiseman,"The book is a complete waste of time and money. Very basic information for people who never seen a horse before this book.As an example: How to hold up a horses front foot properly???? Come on, if you own a horse you should have a clue on how to hold your horses foot.If I had known that this was a book for beginners, I would have NEVER purchased it.The information in this book is very vague and out dated.Save your money and time, purchase a book that is worth while with useful, knowledgeable information."
4,Classic Clark,"This book presents Christian philosopher Gordon H. Clark's response to logical positivism. He asserts that the language philosophers refute themselves in their effort to refute religion. To prove this assertion, Clark takes on Russell, Ayer, Wittgenstein, Carnap, and a host of other similar thinkers. Language and Theology is an excellent example of Clark's skill at making plain the shortcomings of other philosophies while boldly displaying the reasonableness of biblical Christianity."
5,A must,"I don't care if people called me an ""otaku"", or a man who doesn't have the understanding of what a girl is, i don't care, this is a must, one of the very best models, and from the best gundam movie ever, this and the sazabi are a must, and this is the one you want, because you have something quite challenging to build, and fun in the process, and not too simple that a retard can do it, and besides why would you want the PG model, it's hugely expensive, too difficult, and it's not meant for human beings, but with this, the HG model who's aimed to a wider and more human audience, you can enjoy having and being part of this Gundam Era."
3,a good book about baseball for all ages,My story is written by Terry Egan the story is called HEROES OF THE GAME I realy liked this book because it is a collection of different stories in which keeps you interest so you do not get bored. This book is about a lot of different stories and how baseball players became famous it also tells how they are today. This would be a good book if you are not the best or fast reader.
4,Minimal tech-electro-clash-house-stuff,"Sometimes thing are hard to label, Swayzak is hard to label, it's not techno, it's certainly not house, it's not ambient, it's not electro it's whatever. It is however very minimal clear cut tech, with a hint of electro (80's) and even goth (track #3)I have to be honest, I never was a big Swayzak fan but this album it just excellent, every track is a mini electro diamond. It's excellent stuff you want to play after you got home from a night out but still have an hour of energy left.Go get it, this probably will be a classic"
5,Very Good Svc,I rec'd verrrrrrry good service. The merchantdise was excellent and the delivery of the product (Charmed - The Final Season)was more pleasing than I could have hoped for.
5,GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!,LOVE THE FINAL INSTALLMENT IN THIS SERIES I'LL BE SURE TO ADD THEM TO MY FAVORITE TV SERIES SHOWS
4,Bye bye Charmed :(,"At first, I thought the show had gone down hill when I first watched this season. Then I bought the DVD since I wanted to finish my collection of Charmed, and being faithful to the show, rewatched the episodes. I think the second time viewing was better. I think it was worth buying the DVD once you get used to the additional characters and fast paced rush to the finale. It puts a nice little bow on top of a box filled with nostalgia.You'll be sad it ended, but you won't ever forget the uniqueness of 8 years worth of being CHARMED! :)(additional features is a plus but wished there was more interviews with the cast and maybe a gag reel or two???)"
4,Less Charmed,In this season they introduced new characters which get more screen time then the charmed trio. Over all its not a bad season its got plenty off action with the return of the triad and a brief appearance by the source. The last episode was excellent it covered the whole charmed line. If your a fan of charmed this is a must season to get.
4,"I love Charmed, but...","why did the angel of destiny have to take Leo? I think the big battle at the end was lame. You can't make fans, who have watched Charmed for over 7 years, believe two young, dumb, blonds can be that big of a threat. I thought I read somewhere that they took him out for budget reasons? Despite the ""big threat"" I enjoyed watching the show, and I've been avoiding the re-runs on TV so when it comes out on DVD I won't be tired of it. I really looking forward the the last show again. I LOVED seeing everyone together again!"
2,"I really liked the Charmed ones, but I could have done without Billie and Christy","I came late to watching Charmed. Don't know how I missed it, except that I don't watch much tv. However I enjoyed every episode of the first 7 seasons--I did think that Cole got a raw deal-but I truly stopped watching it some during the 8th season because Billie and Christy, especially Christy were very tiresome. As so many other reviews expressed, how could two blond bimbos out-magic the charmed ones? I have ordered the 8th season tho, so, just as one reviewer aptly put it, I will have a complete set!"
5,wish they'd do a reunion episode,Wouldn't it be nice to see the witches with thier respective children andinstructing them in the craft ? But these will have to do .... true fans miss the message offamily first and loyalty above all.
5,I love Charmed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Charmed is so great, and I am sad to see the show go, but they go out with a bang!"
5,cool,In my opinion for the last part of the show they should have invited prudance so that she can also fight with cristy&billy that means instead of power of three it would be power of four and the name of the final part as well.. That mean 4 sisters would gonna fight it would be awesome if they invited them.. but it still good i love you charmed for ever and ever!
1,not received,I purchased Charmed 8th season and have not received the dvds. Please advice as to when item is going to arrive.
3,Charmed,I was shocked to find that Charmed was being cancelled! I had just started getting into it around season 5 and I had to buy the other 4 seasons so I could watch them and I absolutely fell in love with the show! Having a spin off with Christ and Wyatt would be superb but I will forever missed the Charmed Sisters...
1,charmed ended with season 7,"I can't believe any die-hard charmed fan would want to see the 8th season again. first of all, for seven years the charmed ones are the most powerful witches. also, the finale of the seventh season was fully conclusive. then suddenly its a couple of blond college girls (sisters, even, which i think really undermines the power of three plot) who totally kick their butts for most of the season, regardless of final outcome. also, the finale, was, in comparison to other charmed finales, lame. i found the characters of billie and christie so very irritating the entire season. although i did like coop, and henry, i will happily go without those story lines to avoid the rest of the season. the show ended well with the seventh season. the eighth was obviously tagged on, and is just not worth it."
4,What Now,"I really enjoyed the final series but it seems to me (how about you?) that the last two parter left it open for, do I dare say it, a movie? It really would be interesting to see all the interactions of the kids in the future. A lot of loose ends there. However, I don't want to see movie after movie. Just one good one would do. It is sad that Pru's picture was not on the wall in the end. That was the only part I found sad."
4,charmed forever,Loved it! I bought it to watch the last season and series finale. I sat and watched the whole collection in 2 days!
4,charmed season 8,"I was order charmed season 8, you send my stuff and came with right date. Thank you very much for your help and your service."
1,should have left well enough alone,"Frankly they left it nicely closed at the end of season 7 and could've come back to it in a couple of years when the boy's were old enough to be taught. A whole new dinamic for them to explore.Instead they threw together and it really looked it a series full of recycled stories, plot holes and a few celebraties. It ignores so many of the rules and cations writen carefully into other seasons until it made an absolute hash of what was a great seris instead dragging it slowly through alot of stupid Sh-t until it was too painful to watch.My cat could've done better. The sisters still being by their oringals is the only reason for the one star. It's more like minus 5."
3,Charmed Final Season Has A Disclaimer,"It is with great sadness, that the ""Final Season"" aka ""Charmed the Complete Eighth Season"" has a disclaimer in very small lettering on the back of the box. Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions. Music has been changed for this home entertainment version. Sorry guys, this is a confirmation. However, the final season does have special features.What else can I do, except purchase it to complete the series. I guess we cannot help the license issues (money makes the world go around!) that govern it. Happy viewing to the end of a great show!"
4,Final Season...not too bad,"I love Charmed, but the addition of Kaley Cuoco and the chick who played her sister irritated me to no end. Like many die-hard fans I pretty much hated their two characters.(if you saw the show's message board not too many cared for Kaley C at all) Not to knock the actress herself though...she was great on 8 Simple Rules. I also really missed Darrel and the regulars we all got used to seeing. Getting rid of Leo for a time was irritating too. However, the season ending was really cool. I liked getting to see a bit into the future. So buy it, the show isn't complete without the final season. Get it while it's hot! PS. I really hope they have extra's on this one!"
3,billie = bad casting,"I'll give it three stars for Piper, Paige & Phoebe but bringing on the new 'sister' Billie totally ruined this show for me at the end. I don't know if it was a political move to have this actress starring on this show but it was a horrible mistake. The producer didn't want to continue the show I know, but he didn't have to butcher the finale!Thanks"
3,Simple reference - outdated even when revised,"This might have been a good book back in the middle 60's when we didn't have the internet and other references, but it is saddly outdated now, even in its revised format. I only have to point to the fact that the book has no pictures, even when it is trying to describe the different birds. You are left to your imagination. Might be a good book for a child you are trying to teach, but for a seasoned veteran you know that there are much better references out there. I could have marked it lower, but gave it 3 stars just because I like to read old books and it is a reference book that I didn't have on my shelf."
4,"Good product, easy to use","Have been using it for several months after I lost my c drive. The install cd doubles as a boot disk which has the utilities to allow you to restore from the drives. You can also click on the somewhat compressed backups and extract a single file. No problem seeing my USB backup that has 173 gigs. Automated scheduler works with no problem. You can set the times and how many copies you want to keep. Works while you sleep. Pretty easy.If you are like I was, and think it will be no big deal to go back and rebuild your c drive from scratch - think again. It's a major pain and 2-3 weeks later you will still be finding stuff you haven't reinstalled yet. For a few bucks you can avoid it."
1,Problem with Framework,This program must us Microsoft's Framework Program it will ask to load it if you don't have it. You then can load the Drive Image 7 program. In my case I found that at that point I needed 256 MB of Ram free for the progam to work. I have that on my Comp. But Because some of it is used in my video card I had to put in a 512 MB RAM card. When the card was put in at the comp. shop system crash. When In boot mode He found that Frame work was the problem. once it was removed the comp. worked. When I got home I found that any time I used Help I would get an error Message about framework and the same thing would happen if I tried to down load a Program. I had to goto the Microsoft Windows Update Page to load v1.1.4322 framework just to stop the message from coming up I can remove the old frame work but if I then try to remove the new framework same error messages. Space it takes up is 37.9 MB and I don't use the program.
1,Poor product and even worst support!,"I purchased Drive Image 7.0 to backup a 160G 3 partition hard drive on Windows 2000 pro. It only sees one partition, if you run a utility program from Power Quest it thinks the end cylinder is larger than the disk, but if you look at the data, it is the end cylinder from Power Quest that doesn't seem to support extended partitions larger than 137 GB. The main issue is that the Drive Image program doesn't report any errors, it just sees one partition. When I called for support, they were extremely un helpful, after downloading the latest version of the SW it still doesn't work. The problem is still not solved!"
1,Terrible support even for telephone activation,"PowerQuest used to provide excellent support last 5 years when I used their product. Symantec is giving us almost no support. The web site won't even give you instructions for activating the Drive Image 7 or Partition Magic 8 by phone correctly. What they gave you won't work for DI7 or PM8. Telephone number they ask you to call for activation is always busy and tell you to call back later. We paid for the long distance charge too. After 15 or 30 days,(depends on which document you read) you are locked out of the software you paid for if you cannot get through to Symantec.. Other very serious problems are revealed by other customers. Read their comments before you want to pay for the software. Also if you own more than one computers, you must purchase another license.I'll just go back to my DI5 and PM7 for now."
1,Drive Image 7 - Not the right stuff,Try Drive Image 7 and didn't work. Upgraded to 7.03 the same error message.Description: An error occurred creating a backup of drive C:\. The Virtual Volume Imaging driver (pqv2i.sys) is not present on the system.Error Description: An error occurred creating a backup of drive C:\. The Virtual Volume Imaging driver (pqv2i.sys) is not present on the system.Error EC8F000C: Cannot find the Virtual Volume Image driver. Error 00000002: The system cannot find the file specified.Details: Unspecified error: Cannot find the Virtual Volume Image driver. Error 00000002: The system cannot find the file specified.Details: Unspecified errorSince I opened the software - can not return it and I'm stuck with something that doesn't work. :-(
1,Better have a backup!,"Drive Image 7 has a defect in one of its modules that caused my computer to crash on installation during the reboot. I was able to salvage it by using the ""System Restore"" CD from my vendor and a recent emergency disk. This with Windows 2000 Professional.PowerQuest told me that they were very aware of the problem but don't know when - or if - this will be fixed!"
5,You'll be sorry if you don't have it.,"Like most computer users, I expected that sooner or later something would go wrong. So I made it a practice to back up my entire computer (3 of them) from time to time. Something got on one of them. Try as I might, I couldn't find it and it was occupying a huge amount of space (almost 20 gb). Long story short, I considered reformatting the hard drive and reloading a ton of programs. First, I thought I'd try to reinstall the backup image of the drive. It worked like a charm. My concern that the old ""hidden"" program or whatever, wouldn't be overwritten. It was and it was restored perfectly to the last backup point. Don't be without it. You will need a device to backup to such as an external hard drive. Otherwise, a charm."
1,Does not support Win XP,"There seems to be no way to upgrade a hard drive using Windows XP with Drive Image 7. Numerous attempts, even with attempting to reinstall XP ended in failure. I finally used Acronis True Image 6 and accomplished the upgrade on the first attemp."
5,Terrific piece of writing,"Hyland does a masterful job of inhabiting the mind of this novel's 11 year old protagonist. Her prose, though unadorned, is highly evocative. To read this novel is to remember what it felt like not to understand the ways of parents and grown-ups and the world outside one's door. Well deserving of it's Booker nomination."
2,Mediocre,"The novel doesn't really deliver the sort of emotional impact you want and expect.The story is premised on some key characteristics of the main character (his size, unusual ability to tell when people are lying) which not only don't resonate emotionally with the reader, but also don't seem terribly believable. The writing is muted and almost flat, so what could and should be vital plot developments end up being more or less statements of fact. The result is that the struggles experienced by a boy growing up in unfortunate circumstances don't really come across as genuine or important. They just seem contrived and boring."
3,Disturbing Tense & Pointlessly Depressing,"Repetitively mundane & pointless with a few sparks of sheer genius but not enough to make it worthwhile.As you diligently plod through it, there is this incredible feeling of unease....like you are intruding on their lives ...the routine is stifling ...as are the repetitive circular & aimless conversations that are often left hanging.To sum it up - reading this book is akin to having a rotten tooth pulled...something you have to do but know you won't enjoy!One jam sandwich away from being a waste of time & I am actually relieved to put it away!"
4,A character driven book that sucks you in...,"It's true that the book is singularly focused on the main character, John Egan, an eleven year old boy of unusual height and even more unusual ideas about how he'll make it big one day. But the author also paints a vivid picture of what it's like to be poor and without hope in Ireland. I was quickly sucked into reading the book...not necessarily because of the plot, as not much really ""happens""...but more because you wonder how far down John will spiral before getting a grip. I recommend this book as a great character development read that's written simply but pwerfully."
2,not enough information,"I saw this book in the bookstore and I was shocked at how little was said about each book. Each book description was less than a page- of course that was just what I saw from looking at the book in the bookstore- there may have been longer reviews that I didn't see. Plus, I didn't see anything else like, why to read certain books- which authors write similiar books, or what book to read if your in a certain mood and so on.But if you just want to read desciptions of books to read, then this book's for you."
1,Not good category & Too simple,"If I would have skimmed the book content, I would not buy it, since the category per se is not well organized, completed, and desirable, and further these suggesting books are far more simple, superficial, coarse, and non-classical. It directly comes to my mind that maybe the list is only from the author's reading record that provide the proof of his industrious time and mind consumption."
2,Engravings poorly reproduced,"This book (the original one, I mean) is an extraordinary achievement, the copper engravings are of the highest quality, and the images are very beautiful. It is a pity that Scranton University didn't produce a better reproduction of the original engravings (the cover is better... ). The preface could also be more informative, telling the story of the original production and its aim (to be spread worldwide, and inspire painters and wood engravers), and also a bit of Nadal's life and studies at Alcala and Paris universities, and career in the Jesuits, his friendship with Loyola and Francis Xavier, his influence on teaching and founding of schools.Any how I'm happy with the book, I'll put it next to an original 1593 copy I own, unfornunately lacking the engraved frontispice."
4,Portable's other alias,"Alan Abrahams, aka Portable, takes Portable's signature tribal African rhythms and amps them up to thumping 4 on the floor techno rhythms. A must if you're a fan of techno/trance. Once you get into this, then check out his Portable CDs Cycling and Version for some chill downtempo grooves."
5,Exactly What I Needed For Class,"The book came in, it was what I needed, and in perfect condition. I skimmed through it, and am actually excited to read it for my Clinical Ethics course."
4,Ethical Dimensions indeed,"Hello fellow book readers,this is a very good introduction book for the topic of ethics in health care. So far, i have taken a class on the same topic and not found a better book for those who are looking at health care as a career.the book deals with morals vs. ethics and the difference in the defintions of the two words. It then gives you ethical theories that have been used to evaluate what decision to make in health care from kantian to rawls to ontological to virtue ethics.It is a good book for those interested in health care at a general level and looking to see what one will have to encounter in terms of ethical dilemmas and problems. It is also a good book for just general discussion of ethics.One thing, it lacks, is no focus on divine command theory and other theories related to religion. It is thus not absolutely complete especially for those who care what God has to say like a lot of people.AR"
4,easy to read!,It really makes you think for yourself given different ethical situations which I think is great! But for beginning learners I think it should also include some helpful outcomes in some of the ethical dilemas..But overall good learning tool!
1,Cheap,I bought this for the purposes of using during crossfit and they ripped apart after a month of use. Pay more for the higher quality stuff.
3,A rose by any other name..........,"Morgan Fairchild was somewhat more modestly exposed than I expected. She's a beautiful woman any way you look at her, however."
2,Body Chemistry 3 Point Of Seduction VHS,"Good Skin-a-Max late night film,Horrible plot and acting. lots of gratuitous nudity that Mr.Skin would be proud. worth watching On Late Night tv. I can't stand Soap Operas or anything similar. low rating for the horrible ""serious"" acting. 4-5 for the sleazy stuff."
3,not too elastic,I wish the belt had more elasticity - also the sequints are delicate - fall off easily - but for one or two wears it is fine
4,Hey Viv ! 50's Fun Fashions: Sequin Cinch Belt,"This item isn't quite as wide as what the picture makes it look when worn, but over all it is a great belt for costumes."
4,Great drumming,"It's easy to understand why Ginger inspired so many drummers after you hear him play. I think all rock and roll, jazz and blues drummers should buy this album."
4,Positive Review from a Friend,"I bought this book for a friend who was studying introductory Punjabi. No bookstores in the area had a dictionary, so I bought this for her. Several months into her course, I asked my friend what she thought of the dictionary. She said it was ""very useful,"" and I saw her carry it to class and back.Since the review was so positive, I don't mind passing it along here, even though I didn't use the item myself."
1,not worth it,"this book is not worth it, especially 15 freakin bucks, which is worth one of those 800 pages books...or with 15 bucks i could have gotten me a copy of 10 real sats!the words are too basic, and the book doesnt really help u understand vocabulary... i already knew most of the words"
1,hm...it is a waste of time,"hi! i am currently a high school junior in New York. After goint throught this book, it made me think ""damn, i just wasted my time"". This book may seem interesting and fun but for a student who will take the SAT in a matter of months, it is an absolute waste of time. The vocabulary is far too basic, and the activities are not efficent. I strongly encourage people not to buy this book!"
2,Not a full-sized bag,"It's definitely a thicker and well-made bag, but after I bought it and tried to fit a full-sized student cello inside... we could barely get it zipped up. It is slightly too tight and too short for the instrument. If I was going to be transporting my cello from place to place, I'd get a different bag and return this one. However, it's not worth the hassle for something I won't use as often."
4,Nice case for the price,"We bought this case for a used 3/4 size cello we got for our 4th grade daughter who is just starting. The case that came with it was hard to carry. This one is good, it has plenty of handles and two backpack style straps so she can carry the instrument (which is almost as big as she is) at school. There's a pocket for music, another for rosin etc, and a bow pocket. The description says it has 15mm padding, which led me to believe that it was more padded than it actually is - it's basically the nylon outer and a thin inner liner providing a tiny bit of padding. But it fits well and works well, so we're happy, just don't expect a ton of protection."
2,Poor Quality,"People cannnot hear me without static or I, them with only a short distance from phone. does pair and work well with 2 phones at the same time"
2,Didn't work for me.,"I bought the headset for my Verizon Razr V3m phone. I really like the look of the Bluetrek G2 and had been researching various brands for over a year. I read the other reviews here and confirmed someone else was using it successfully with their Razr. When I got it home and charged it the appropriate length of time, I tried to pair it. And it worked the first time, but when I tried to re-establish a connection, I just got a continuous beeping sound from the headset.I contacted the company about the problem and got a response. But, by that time, I was fed up with it not working correctly and sent it back to Amazon. Their solution wasn't anything I hadn't tried already, anyway. So, be sure this will absolutely work with your phone before you buy!"
2,Not recommened,"Everyone I talked to complained about an echo, I didn't hear but it was different people at different places"
4,Not just for diabetes- works for weight loss too!,"Although this book is aimed at people with diabetes, a friend who is following a low carbohydrate diet to lose weight recommended it to me. It's full of fast family recipes and the amount of carbohydrate in each serving is highlighted. Many of the recipes have 0 carbohydrate. I am using ""The Carbohydrate Counting Cookbook"" to help me lose weight- and it's working!"
1,I was so disapointed with this book!,"I was expecting a cookbook that dealt with the low-sugar, low-carbohydrate issue and found one that does not. The use of juice, white flour and pre-packaged stuffing mix floored me. I only found a handful of recipes that would be useful to the low-carb dieter or diabetic because the ingredients used are not low-glycemic. If you're a low-carb dieter looking for a cookbook, this isn't it."
5,works as expected,"So far I have no problems with this ink. No clogs, good color reproduction. Carts fine perfect. For a budget and printing for home personal use, I'd probably recommend these."
4,Great Book,I wasn't sure how I would like it when I started reading it - but it was awesome how it all came together and once into the book - cannot put it down! GREAT reading! Highly recommended!
2,Why I won't touch this one,"Drivin' Wheel is the best song on Night Shift. It was easily my favorite track. It was originally longer than the 4:29 version you see most places. I haven't looked it up on my LP but I think the original version is 5:11. I think the 4:29 version was the 45rpm record that played in jukeboxes. I want the original. I am not disappointed that some kid, who probably didn't know the difference, included it on a Remastered release of all things. I am disappointed in the Foghat representative who must have signed off on it."
4,Sociology is the key,This is a great book for beginning students. I am just starting out in this field and this is my first class in the filed. When I first saw this book I was attracted to the cover and the design. It is a beautiful book and very colorful. This pages are also well presented with color and graphic design. The cover ripped the frist time I opened the book so be carefull with this. Although I'm not a teacher I believe that this book is a good source for education. This book can be used as an everyday clssroom book or as a distance learning text as I'm using it. The publishers have a web site that is full of teacher guides and questions for the students to help them with test and quizes. I believe that this text will become pertanent for educating at the college level.
1,What a WASTE of money!!!,"This might be a good book for those who are related to the field of sociology, or are more involved on it. I am a nursing student and I had to take this introductory course. The book was SO confusing, in some parts not so clear, I really hated it. I had to buy it because it was the book required for my course, but I think there would be many other books out there better than this, and easier to understand. The worst part is that it is SO expensive. What a waste of money!"
5,"Lightest, full-featured laptop available","This is the perfect laptop for the traveler who does basic computing. This is not a heavy gamers machine, nor is it a desktop replacement. But for normal stuff it is more than adequate. It is so light you hardly know it is on your lap. Its weight and size make it easy to carry anywhere. It has a regular sized screen which means the pages fill the whole screen and the fonts are bigger (compared to a widescreen). If you are looking for a laptop like this, you will not be disappointed."
3,dean bass,"ok i got the dean edge 1 bass, trans amberburst. first the edge's on the body are not rounded or contoured like the picture is showing it should be, and the picture of the bass i used to order (not the picture showing now) showed the bass having the amber around the edges and having an inner fade to a goldish-orange thus the trans amberBURST, and the one i recieved doesn't it only has the trans amber and no rounded edge's."
1,It's came brocked.,Did not get any refound. Just lost $40blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
1,CHINESE TORTURE CHAMBER STORY,TERRIBLE!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.THE MOVIE IS HARD TO FOLLOW.
2,"Tiny, nondescript plastic toy in sticky, nasty goo.","The problem is, the goo that this tiny toy comes in is nasty. It is like glue. I would hate this to get all over my house. I had to take the toy out and wash it. All my child wanted was the little sea creature toy, NOT to nasty goo. And of course, the 1 inch long ting was taken by another kid at school within a week. So, there ya have it!"
2,Not Toho's best!!,"This movie outright sucks. There is no plot in the movie and if there was a plot, I missed it. The acting was terrible and the special effects was done by a third-string team that Toho somehow continued to employ. Not Toho's best produced movie. The monster Manda looks like it was put together by 3 year old kids with no imagination. Overall not a great movie and would not recommend for anyone to get."
4,Good Stuff cheap!!,"Shades of the 60's ... hey ... this is good stuff!! There's just so much about Japanese Sci-Fi that's just plain fun to watch. You gotta use your imagination ... and don't let the fact that you sometimes can see the wire holding that submarine aloft. There's thrills, chills, and adventure ... and the good guys win at the end. Remember ... there were no computers for special effects when this was made."
2,A waste of money,"I wish I had never bought this DVD,I enjoy classic Japanese sci fi,but this one I never saw,thats why I bought it,and I am disappointed with it."
3,Just a comment,"It doesn't say so in the jacket or even most reviews, but it would probably help book shoppers to know that this book is a gym-only book, for those with access to a variety of high-tech machines. There are few--and I mean FEW--exercises that use free weights and no free-weight alternatives. I'm not saying it's a bad book; it's just not for people looking for a home workout or one that uses a minimum of equipment."
5,A Refreshing Change,"I really enjoyed this book. It is a great step by step guide to workouts with optimal results. I have been working out for over twenty years. I have seen many training routines, all with variations of the same exercises. Usually these routines require maximum effort with minimal results. Hot Point Fitness is truly a refreshing change. This book shows you how to get maximum results from your workouts to bring you to that next level of fitness. I am looking forward to continuing with these new techniques. It has made going to the gym fun again!"
5,Great Partner for Lifting Weights,"A friend had this book and let me use it, I just loved all the workouts and wanted my own copy. Its great for someone who is just learning how to lift weights because it gives you a daily workout plan and shows you how to do the exercise if your not sure how. The shipping wait was kind of long and I keep waiting everyday for my package, they estimated 21 days and it took all 21 days,"
2,Beginner's Book,"Not at all what I expected, I thought it would provide new workouts which, as the book hyped, would trigger new growth in the targeted muscles do to 100% muscle activity being used. Yet, all I saw were two exercises he came up with in the book. I could have written this book, anyone who has ever lifted for 2 years could have written this book. All it is is a beginners book telling you the need to be physically fit, and then literally going through different CLASSIC exercises for each muscle group. If you are a beginner who has not read anything yourself or ever really lifted then this book is for you (although I must add there are probably a lot better beginner books out there). But, you if you want to lift weights and get in better shape, there are no secrets, literally, it takes dedication, patience, and hard work and correct eating. This book was good on getting you diet ready however, so, there's a plus there."
4,Great program,"This is a great book if you don't want to pay for a personal trainer..like me...you just have to stick with it and the results will come...just be patient. I like how it has a day by day schedule.The graphics are great.I would recommend it. It would have received 5 stars if there was some type of video with it or something that you can download to have some type of motivation, but overall it is good."
1,Stay Away!!!,"I was given this book by one of my clients to review (I am a personal trainer and exercise physiologist). After reading it, I was appalled. It is exactly what is wrong with the fitness industry. The author, apparently a personal trainer, perpetrates numerous myths about fitness that have no scientific basis. His knowledge about exercise is very limited and his knowledge of nutrition is even worse. Anyone can call themselves a ""fitness expert."" Unfortunately, this doesn't mean it's true. Don't be lured in by fitness hucksters. As with everything, buyer beware!Jack Schur, CFT"
3,This was ok.,Everybody got a opinion on how to stay fit. Everybody trained the stars of hollywood. Its all the same. Stick to a diet and workout plan you will be good. I should write a book but it would one sentences: Eat less do more.
3,Not Worth the Money,"I am disappointed in this purchase. The book is VERY short and not very interesting in terms of a ""story"". There are only 5 scents: pineapple, cake, cola, ""fruit scented bath bubbles"", and mint. The smells are accurate and strong (for now). My 2 year old does not like the cola smell AT ALL. My opinion is that a book rated for ""ages 1 and up"" should not even have cola in it! I agree with another reviewer in that there were many other opportunities where other scents could have been added. That would have made the price of the book more worth it."
1,Not Compatible with PowerShot S100,"I bought this battery for my recently purchased Canon PowerShot S100 (12.1 Megapixel model). The Lemnar battery (DLC1LH) is significantly longer than the battery that came with my camera (Canon NB-5L) and thus will not fit in the camera. The packaging indicates that the Lemnar will fit for the PowerShot S100, but it does NOT. This Lemnar replaces Canon's NB-1L and NB-1LH batteries only. Not sure why there's conflicting information on the packaging. This battery may have been a replacement to an older Canon camera with the same model number."
3,Good Batts,These batts are for a relatively older camera. The first set I bought were from a different web site and were no good. Wouldn't hold a charge. These appear to hold a charge. Worth a shot based on pricing.
5,Do they sound like the Pixies?,"No. So why are people so hell-bent that they sound like TV on the Radio? Yes, one can compare them to a number of bands, but when is that not the case? The difference is, Celebration has created an entity out their music. It's a living thing and when experienced live, almost soul-crushing in its ability to draw you in. The album is especially good when heard on headphones. Highly highly recommended."
1,the death of 4AD,"tuneless amorphousness from these total poseurs who, despite the fact that they can't be ""pegged"" as ripping off any particular band or genre, have no sound or style of their own save for an overarching kinda pretentiousness and abrasiveness. 4AD of yore--pixies, cocteaus, throwing muses, pale saints, et alia--oh my god where have ye gone? i listened twice and didn't find a melody worth a canadian penny. no no no!"
4,Underated,"The Evereadys were probably one of the most underated gospelquartet in the 80's. These group of men are truly spiritfilled. Their lack of notoriety, I believe cost thema recording career. However, I am glad to know that they are still singing the gospel."
2,Dated mystery,"A dated mystery set in Washington DC during World War II among the upper class. I was interested in the story, but the whole feel was so out of date. I don't think I'll read any more by the author.Oh, and this is my vote for the ugliest cover of the year."
3,Beneath Fortier...,"This is by no means a BAD compilation/mix... BUT... ""Audio Tour"" is quite a medicore follow-up to Fortier's BEDROCK masterpiece.The tracks flow well enough but one can painfully discern where one track ends and another begins. With production credits lacking dates I am left to assume this is a Fade records ""best of."" And it's obvious... (i.e.Luigi: ""Creation"",circa 2001...) Purchase this disc if you're starved for something new - as I was. If not, hold on for Anthony Pappa's ""Balance 006"" due in late May. The track-listing looks quite promising with new tracks from Tilt and Graham (Quivver) and Sutton (Evolution). Can't wait!!!And Chris, if you're reading, put a bit more effort into your next CD mix/release. We all know you're MORE than capable."
2,Pretty lame,"Most of the book copies directly from the FS X screens (missions, tutorials, etc) and is filled with bad looking screenshots. There is some interesting info about the planes (history, current uses) but most of it can be found elsewhere for free. The quick reference card is useful, but there are several available for download on the net. There are several typos, but I'm not a grammar nazi. I should have looked at it more carefully before I bought it.It appears that Prima is releasing another ""Prima Official Game Guide in mid-January). I'm not sure if it's the same book as this or not."
1,Modern Table Lamp,I can't honestly review this product being that I never received it!!! What I can review is the seller. Overall I was satisfied with them but not thrilled. I bought this product and many others...some came and others didn't. Some items came damaged and others came in good condition. I think it is just like everything...you get what you pay for. I was upset that I paid for the product and I had to call the seller to get a refund. The seller should have notified me if they couldn't fulfill my order.
5,Sat 2 Writing,"I did not start reviewing for this test until two weeks before the test date. So I turned to this book, and I learned many good strategies for essay writing and about sentence structure. Going into this, I thought I probably wouldn't do too well; I struggled on the writing section of the PSAT. But I did pretty well on the practice test in the Real SAT 2 book and then I got a 750 on the actual test. So I suppose that something must have gone right."
2,Wouldn't recommend Barrons...,"The best thing about this book was the section it devoted to the essay portion of the test. It gave great examples of good essays and bad essays, what to avoid and what to exercise when writing your essay. BUT, the review for the other two sections was shotty. It gave decent overviews of grammar, but it doesn't give any practice questions... AT ALL. Only exercises that make you write and are extremely boring. I got a 700 on this test, which is a decent score, but I barely looked at this book because I thought it was just so boring, and I doubt I would have done much better if I did."
2,sat 2 writing,"Barron's SAT II book is alright. This book contains five sample tests, which are not entirely like the actual SAT 2 writing tests. Foremost, the sections in which one must improve paragraphs are not very good. Yet the improving sentences sections are good overall, while the identifying sentence errors sections are alright. Additionally, I found that the questions were somewhat more difficult that the actual exam's qeustions are. I feel that I benefited more from the 1 Writing Test in ""Real SAT 2: Subject Tests"" by the College Board than from all of the tests in this book. In conclusion, I would probably not have purchased this book if another had been available. This book's section on writing sample essays is better than the multiple choice sections."
2,Disappointing,"Unlike other Barron's test preparation books, this book turns out to be a big disappointment. The practice tests do not resemble actual tests. They give you a lot grammatical rules that are so confusing. Having read the grammatical rules, i was more confused than anyone else taking the test. It turns out that ""the more you practice, the more you err"". This book does not give you enough examples. Practice test are flawed with numerous errors. Regrettedly, there are no good preparations for SAT II Writing. The only thing you can do is to get accustomed with English language."
2,Needs improved editing,"Barron's SAT II Writing covers the basic topics on the SAT II. Its essay writing sugesstions are beneficial and useful; however, the five practice tests in the back of the book are flawed. The practice tests contain typos that greatly confuse the reader. In a few cases the book stated the answer as one thing and then had a different answer for the same question in anonther location. After taking the writing test four times (twice on the PSAT and twice on the real SAT II), I feel that many of the practice questions that Barron's offers are not similar to ones found on the test. However, if one really needs help with the SAT II Writing then Barron's will provide limited help; just don't always believe the book is correct. Personally, I prefered Kaplan's guide to the SAT II Writing."
5,Very helpful and readable book,"This Barron's book helped me a great deal to prepare for the SATII in Writing. The book give good instructions in essay writing and has many good examples of essays to study. The author's style is easy to follow and enjoyable to read, since it is both informational and humorous."
1,NOT A CLASSIC ALBUMS RELEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Mr.K said it all I just want to chime in and let all interested know this dvd is not part of the Classic Albums(Eagle Rock) series.The ""famouspresons"" reviewing this L.P. are members of Mostly Autum a great group of musicians who must stop these awful horid reviews of grat bands and records (they have a collection of dvds called Critical Review all of which are a waste of time and money)So before you buy check the production company.Eagle Rock is the one you want."
2,It could have been much better,"Obviously the film-material around this album is very hard to get.It was, and still is, a standout album of the Pink Floyd but for me it seems like this DVD is a throw-away about the real thing.Nothing new is said for those familiar with the Floyd-story.There is absolutely nothing shown from that era and the main story is told by some people I never even heard of! (Sorry, if you're famous).The songs from the album are played in the background but some of them are picked from the live-shows of the Gilmour-era.Someone who really likes the album but don't know so much about Pink Floyd, will be satisfied with all the things these guys are telling as a fact, or as they feel about it!"
1,Wish it werent here in my home,"I purchased this thinking it was a Pink Floyd concert. WRONG!This is a pile of British blather about Floyd, and it's history. Evidently there was a rash of this which makes buying a real concert video such a chore."
1,Milestones,These things are usually a waste of time. I have been listening to Pink Floyd since the 60's and was bored with this.
2,not so much,"Although it said it was about Wish You Were Here, I didn't believe that was all there was. That's all there was!"
2,Mediocre,"i like that it covers the whole car seat and more but it is thin - should've provided more padded protection as I have leather seats and can easily get ruined, and cannot go over a headrest, it keeps slipping off."
5,Excellent and very basic - Small depending on how you look at it,"As said, this is an excellent watch, which was featured in the movie ""Equilibrium"" in 2002. Basically is 2 analog watches together for those who want to keep 2 times readily available (East coast and west coast for example). The size of the watch's display is comparable to a woman's one. What makes it a ""man"" watch is the bracelet and that it is a bit curious. If your eyesight is fading, it may be hard to see the time. They are really small once compared to any other watch. Other than that, it is a collection's item and a novelty watch.JJ"
4,Useful new features,"Looks and works about the same as PI 7, but with a few execellent useability enhancements.1) I love the new ""Level"" command for correcting over- and under-exposed photos. Just pick a pixel that supposed to be pure white and/or one that's pure black, and PI adjusts the picture accordingly. Useful for white balance correction, too.2) The editable Lasso tool is great! You can create really precise selections by creating and moving control points within the Lasso'ed selection.3) The Crop tool is better. It now shades cropped areas (so that you can see the crop in the context of the whole picture) before you finalize the operation.BTW, check out Stephanie's PhotoImpact Tutorials at http://www.....com/ for ideas on how to use all of the new features."
3,First Place Red Discuss,An interesting informative book on track and field. I read it to become more informed about a field I knew nothing aboutl..
3,Aborrecer ouvindo falar de live and dangerous.,"E' muito interessante, mas eu nao gosto muito, demasiado falar sobre la mesma canao, acho que nao è preciso!Nao faz mal!E' melhor ver o concerto: live and dangerous!"
1,THIS IS NOT A CONCERT!!!,"This is an unauthorized documentary, just like the last few done recently with critics giving their opinions about Thin Lizzy. The quality of the live footage is terrible and thrown together with the worst audio imaginable. If you are a Thin Lizzy fan you probably already have this footage on video.Why in 2006 is their not more ""official"" Thin Lizzy concerts and footage availiabe(we know it exsists) with all the enhancements that could be done with older footage? These bottom feeders that produce this ""junk"" hoping fans throw them a few dollars(like I did) should be ashamed of themselves. Avoid at all costs!! If you do buy this dvd, like I did ""you will be sorry."" I wish I knew what I would be expecting before unwrapping, so at least I could return and get my money back."
1,We have to keep waiting for the concert,"What is it with this Classic Rock label and their misrepresentation of concerts and unreleased footage. The ""Inside Thin Lizzy"" was a joke and this tries to carry on in the same way but this joke is not funny. They ask way too much $$$ to listen to mostly unknowns opinions of Thin Lizzy. Anyone want to hear my opinion??? I own all the recordings and have seen them live 3 times in the 70's. That qualifies me as much as anyone on this piece of....Anyway, this is not the concert we have all been waiting for so keep saving your money and say your prayers, one day it will actually see the light. I just hope that I am not too old to enjoy it. BEWARE of this product!"
2,"Buy the other ""Live & Dangerous"" DVD","This is largely as described by the reviewer DJKK and is not a live performance DVD. It's way more an analysis of the record with bits of interviews and chord tutoring thrown in. OK if your looking for this type of critical analysis from a purely informational standpoint but by no means a concert DVD! ! ! ! The review included here by SKY is NOT FOR THIS PRODUCT... it is a review of the other ""Live & Dangerous"" DVD. I love the fact that Amazon lets us (the end consumers/fans) review the releases but I really wish someone would quality check the reviews submitted. SKY's review does not belong on this product."
5,Great Amp,I have owned several amplifiers in the past and this one by far out performs the others. I have it connected to two jl w3's and it suprisingly puts out far more power than the subwoofers can handle.
4,I Would Say,I would say that it has bright and lovely pictures that you would love! Buy this book for your children!
5,Best Book on the Song of Songs,"I have read ten or so books on the Song of Songs, and none can compare to this one!! If you want you're heart to be touched by the fire of God, and radically challenged, this book is for you. Wurmbrand himself was tortured for many years, and the experiences of martyrs he knew, as well as others are woven into this book masterfully to explain the beauty and depth of God's heart as expressed in the Song of Solomon. This book is on my top three list of books, with ""The Singing God"" by Sam Storms, and ""The Pleasures of Loving God"" by Mike Bickle. If you enjoy this book, also be sure to read ""Song of Songs: Journey of the Bride"" written by Dr. Brian Simmons. Dr. Simmons' book journey into the Song of Songs was inspired by a personal meeting with Richard Wurmbrand as well as ""The Sweetest Song""."
4,Jori Hulkkonen - Different,"Jori Hulkkonen's fourth full-length, Different, stays mostly true to its title. Though there's still plenty of graceful tech-house (""You're My Excuse for Being Me,"" ""Strangefaith,"" ""Man from Solaris""), it also starts off on the downtempo notes of ""We Are Rising Sun."" ""Four Seasons, Four Loves"" is oddly romantic, and though the vocals on ""All I See Are Shadows"" and ""Blue and White"" aren't the strongest, they'll do in a pinch. But Hulkkonen is at his best with tech-house such as ""Abstract Living"" or the deep sweetness of ""Latin Taiga"" (though the latter goes on for longer than it should). Perhaps Jori should leave the vocals to better singers, because it mars an otherwise strong album."
3,"Great lights, dependable",This is an older model Piaa lights but thanks to Amazon for still having supplier to support this old but perfectmodel
5,Quick N Easy and it works,"Follow the directions and you will have no problems quick easy, I just put the plug in so I've only gone about 20 miles but held air over night and is still holding air. I would recommend to buy one for every bike or tubeless tire vehicle."
5,The best,"This thing is great, I use it on my motorcycle, 1 ton pickup, the wife's minivan, and camper trailer. Packs small works great!"
1,Buffys Mom is right!,I also own this sprayer and ditto to the comments by Buffys mom. I have only put about five gallons through mine and the sprayer handle broke. Called their 24hour hot line to order parts but recording told me to leave a message or call back during business hours. Look for another brand for your sprayer.
1,No driver support,No driver support for Windows 7 or 64 bit operating systems. The Lorex web site doesn't even mention Windows 7. Camera is useless without drivers.
2,Nice concept but lots of problems,"I bought one of these from Best Buy. Tried to set it up but got a hardware failure when I plugged it in the USB port. Tried it on two other computers and got the same error. Called tech support. They said I needed to update my usb drivers for my computer. Maybe I'd believe that if it happened on one computer but not 3!I took it back and got another one. This time the driver installed ok but their viewer application wouldn't find the camera. Took it to another computer and installed and reinstalled the software several times. Could not get their viewer software to work. However, XP's native driver saw it ok and would let me view the video.Camera quality as written by others is not all that good but it does have night vision.As I said, it is a nice idea. I really wanted a camera with both day and night video capability but this camera is nearly impossible to install and then I could never get their viewing software to work."
1,Camaro White Book,"Very limited information on all camaro's. No real in depth information, just options.I found more information from a Consumer Guide for classic cars published in 1981. The book is not worth the money."
4,Serves it's purpose,"I got this to place my meinl gen X 10"" hats on and it does it's job. Doesn't have any bells or whistles but it will hold a pair of hats.If you are looking for cheap and reliable, give it a shot."
2,Poor Spring Tension,"Pedal tension/spring force was quite weak. With a pair of Zildjian 13"" hi-hat cymbals, there was too much weight and the action was unresponsive. Some nice quality generally, but unacceptable overall. No ability to adjust tension or force. No documentation. Web info is very limited in terms of help.It's going back."
1,DON'T BUY!,After reading the reviews I thought this stand would be decent enough to use.... I WAS WRONG! I have 14inch Sabian XS20 Hi Hat cymbals on it... It's to heavy for it... The stand its self is way to thin... ALSO! Its not high enough!!!!! DON'T BUY!!!!! I'm sad that PDP would even make such a thing...
5,Great for art study,"This puzzle is a great supplement to a classroom study of famous artists. Consider coupling the puzzle with the book Degas and the Little Dancer by Laurence Anholt. When coupled with the book that explains how Degas started doing sculpture after his eyesight started failing, you can link it to a study of the five senses. All these Puzzles Plus famous artist puzzles are well sized for young children and durable enough to stand up to use in the classroom. They work well as floor puzzles as well."
4,This little number can swing,"After great reviews in the Seattle Times and plugs on our local jazz station KPLU, I went to see Judy. Don't miss her if you get a chance. Her album is a lovely collection and she really swings on Oscar Brown's ""Humdrum Blues"". Her good taste shines through in the Beatle's ""In My Life"" and Dylan's ""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right"". Judy, how about rounding out a trio of greats by doing the Stones' ""Wild Horses""?"
5,Judy Wexler's album is a Gem,"Having heard some of the tracks online, I purchased Judy Wexler's ""Easy on the Heart"" and it has been quite a rewarding purchase.The album is a delight and gets better with each listen. I was going to say what my favorite track is, but I have a new favorite each time I listen.While Judy's style and sound are uniquely hers, there are echoes of past jazz greats in this voice (I'm occasionally reminded of Nina Simone, Carmen McCrae and others), but in the end, it is a satisfying sound that is simply Judy Wexler. There's a freshness in her approach and her musicianship while, at the same time, this is a voice of experience. Judy seems to bring a wry sense of having lived a full life to each nuanced sound and it brings a beautiful depth to her interpretation of each song. The musicians on this album are top rate - as are the arrangements and the production.I highly recommend Judy Wexler's ""Easy on the Heart"" and can't wait to get home and listen to it again!"
5,Great CD by a wonderful singer,"Beautiful choice of songs, excellent band and Judy is a wonderful singer!"
1,not an 8X10,"I ordered this picture for use in an 8X10 frame. Dont make the same mistake. The image is 7 3/16 "" wide and doesn't work in an 8x10 frame. The paper is also quite flimsy reminescent of the slick flyers in the Sunday paper."
2,Bring a Six-Pack When You See This Schlock Fest,"Lovers of Bad Cinema can't go wrong with this high-camp double feature from the folks at Something Weird Video - complete with drive-in ads, juvenile-delinquency shorts and schlock trailers. Everyone knows that Ed Wood wrote the screenplay for ""The Violent Years,"" even though his name was omitted from the opening credits. Nevertheless, this 1956 saga of Girls Gone Bad has enough non-acting and Woodian dialogue to satisfy his most ardent fans. Cut from the same low-budget cloth, ""Girl Gang"" is even more wretched and decidedly less fun. Don't forget to bring a six-pack when you watch this smorgasbord of exploitative celluloid."
2,Not nearly bad enough,"I expect less from Ed Wood jr. The movie details the exploits of a gang of bad girls gone really, comically wrong. Robbing gasoline seems a bit unnecessary in the days of 25 cent premium, but we get the point. And how could the cops mistake bandanna masked women for male juvenile delinquents? I don't recall men wearing that much make-up in the 1950's but this movie does come to us from the creator of ""Glen or Glennda"". Better is the ""ravaging"" scene set on lover's lane. However, the movie ends up with some lengthy gratuitous moralizing that we just don't need. Where's the rubber octapus? Oh, wait. Maybe that's the scene we didn't see out on Lover's Lane."
1,Drive-in trailers ruined with onscreen letters!,"I sent this back after finding out the drive-in trailers have the letters ""SWV"" superimposed onscreen! I bought this just for these trailers, the movies are unvandalized but I won't buy any more titles from Something Weird because of this."
5,MRI basic Physics....,"A must have book for the MRI technologist that is new or is seasoned. Written so you understand it, a must have for the registry."
2,HARD TO CLEAN!,I purchased this feeder due to the 2 positive reviews. I just opened the package and to my great disappointment I see the bottom does not come apart for cleaning! Those of us who love and feed hummingbirds know that we have to be meticulously clean with their feeders. I am not sure if I will even use this one as I see no way to reach into all the nooks and crannies.I was into walmart the other day and purchased several perky pet feeders for$3.88. They have turned out to be my absolute favorite. Every part of that little feeder comes apart for thorough cleaning. At that price you could purchase new ones every season!
1,Bad hummingbird feeder,This hummingbird feeder leaks - it drains out overnight after it's filled. Bad product!
1,Junk,"Both top and bottom leaked within a couple weeks. I see a lot of people liked it so it is probably hit and miss on what I received. But, I am not inclined to try to argue about 8 dollar refund on it.I would buy a glass bottle feeder in future."
3,How do you make a dead baby float?,"1 cup root bear,1 scoop dead baby (what more can I say about this book!)"
2,"OK reference, but contains some glaring errors","This is a basic reference work but not the exhaustive all-encompassing ""encyclopedia"" that the title infers. You get the basics, the major players and oranizations, with a sampling of White Power written material in the appendix, but not much else. No photographs of any of the major leaders in the movement. No pictures of symbols, uniforms or flags which are quite important to white nationalists.Yes, a good basic reference, but a very ""ho-hum"" ""encyclopedia""."
1,No input,"I had this card installed in my Dell when I ordered it and I will say it does sound great BUT there is one proplem with it that I need and that is the input will not work. I called Creative Labs, Dell and got no where. Now maybe not many people need to use the input jack but it is a must for me. My old computer had a simple card but it did work. So if you want just great sound, this card is good but if you need to record albums, etc. then forget it, this card won't do it, or at least mine won't."
1,Reformat,"Junk, absolute junk. Don't even try to complain to Creative. Talk about a bunch of losers. If you have a soundblaster already installed, you might as well reformat to get the new one to work. I am a computer engineer for crying out loud. The soundblaster uninstall does not work, and you can spend forever trying to track down all the files that need to be deleted so that your new card will install correctly, but you will never find them all."
4,fabulous sound but watch out...,"this is probably one of the best sound cards you'll come across. great sound and great features.but watch out. for certain motherboard-sound card combinations (like intel, for instance), this card suffers from a ""sqeal of death"". every now and then a high pitched sqeal is emitted from the card and the computer freezes requiring a reboot. this occurs frequently and is very irritating. the problem is said to be with the software drivers so make sure this problem is fixed before buying this card."
4,This sucka rocks!,"I love this card. I owned the first Audigy card and it was mindblowing as well, but I received this card for Christmas because of the fact that I'm a fan of EAX gaming and an audiophile. The reasons I deducted a star is because of the driver situation and the mediasource issue. The drivers can be a real hassle to install if you have XP imho. What I would suggest is downloading the latest XP drivers from their site and be prepared to use them if things don't work well for you. The mediasource issue involves not being able to open the application from the pull down menu. Once updating it, it works fine. Since installing the updated drivers everything sounds and works great! The included installation guide should help the newer computer owners."
5,"BIG, STURDY FUN!","I see everybody has already written how great this book is, but I had to add my praises! We've had this book for about 4 years now and it has held up so well. The size is so much fun! My kids like to put it on the floor and gather around it and look at it together. I think it really encourages sharing and cooperative play. They like to play ""I Spy"" with it as well. Super book, very worth the money."
3,A little dissapointed,"When my daughter recieved this book from my mother as a gift I thought back to when I got the same book when I was growing up. I enjoyed it then but I was a little dissapointed when the binding fell apart. Now 20 years later, I see not much about the this problem has changed. The book is very enjoyable. We must have looked at each of those pages hundreds of times. She was entertained with the simple animals doing every day activities such as bears getting dressed and elephants getting ready for bed. This was one of our most favorite bed time books until it fell apart."
5,Richard Scarry sets the standard!,"Richard Scarry and Bill Peet were my favorite authors as a child, and it was so great to see this book again after 20+ years. I remember the characters and illustrations so well, and it's still just as delightful as I remember it as a child. Wonderful book...one of Richard Scarry's best!"
4,Other Books,"A book for kids that are learning to read. It is basically narrated by a bunch of cute fuzzy bears doing a tour of a town and all the common objects and situations that you might encounter in such a setting, enabling words to go with pictures so that children can go through them and learn to identify the objects as an aid to reading. A well done book."
4,Best Work Book Ever,My kids love this book. We either spend time reading it or we spend time just talking about the pictures. I think it is a good book for all ages.
5,Fun for Kids,"Richard Scarry books are the best. Fun, well illistrated, easy to read.Always worth the money."
4,Not quite the same as the first edition,"If you grew up with this book you might notice a few changes, so be warned. All references to Native Americans have been removed, as well as soldiers and other subtle things to make the book much more politically correct. I'm not sure if the changes were made by the illustrator himself before his death, or at least were authorised by him ... if not, it would be a travesty.However, it's still a wonderful book which all kids should have in their fledgling libraries."
4,My son and I found the book fun and educational,"My son and I love the characters of Richard Scarry We found the variety of nursery rhymes, storys,and letter associations great. Plus, if your child loves animals this is the book to read with them."
5,Class addition to every young library,"This is one of Richard Scarry's most memorable books. I loved this book as a child, and my son loves it now. He consistently grabs this book off his shelf--he loves for us to read together as much as he likes to look at it alone. There are so many words and pages, that it holds his attention for awhile.This isn't a board book, so the paper pages can easily be torn. But it is a good way to teach your child how to care for books, and this is one he will likely treasure forever."
4,Wow was it big!!,I love Richard Scarry's books. I thought this one was the one that had the most words ever but indeed it was the biggest book ever. Definitely a lay on the floor and read book for toddlers. I'm looking forward to doing that!!!
5,I had this book when I was a kid,"I bought it for my daughter's third birthday present. She is enjoying the illustrations as much as I did, this book will be around for awhile."
3,I was a little disappointed...,"I had the book when I was little (we called it Big Book). When I bought it for my son recently, I had the feeling that I remembered pages that weren't there: birds, flowers, buildings. I hunted up my old copy and sure enough, there were quite a few pages missing in the newer book. But nowhere in Joey's book does it say it's a revised edition! What's in the book is great, but I can't get rid of the feeling that we got gypped!Another problem with the book is that it's not bound very well. All our Richard Scarry books seem to fall apart at the spine in very short order. It's true we read them constantly, but we read other books as often, and they don't fall apart as quickly."
4,A wonderful book for introducing everyday things to children,The book lived up to my expectations in terms of content: lots of lovely illustrations and ideas. My two year old daughter adores the book. I have to agree with the review I read as regards binding. We have only had the book for about 4 weeks and the pages have come away from the spine - this is simply not good enough.
5,Should be required reading in every young child's home !,"This delightful ""thematic dictionary"" is definitely required reading for parents and children. It provides pictures and words to most every situation a young child encounters. From ""the new day,"" to the zoo, to school, to things we do, this invaluable and fun learning tool is a must for young children and their parents."
5,Giant and Fun,This book is huge. My 2 1/2 yr old neice loves it. It is big enough to not get lost and to keep her attention for a long time. There is so much on a page to look at.
5,The Best for Toddlers.,"This was my children's favorite book when they were toddler/preschoolers. I am now buying it for all my grandchildren. Pages for everyone. Trucks, farm, zoo, colors, seasons, babies all labeled individually with their name. When they are at the stage where they are repeating the name for everything this is what they liked to look through. Each child had their favorite page that we had to stop and study."
4,A favorite children's classic,"This and other Richard Scarry books were my favorites as children, and my children will read them someday, too. I especially love Lowly Worm."
1,This book is too big!,"Nowhere in the write-up for this book does it say that the book is 2 feet tall! I thought that it would be big in contents, but instead it is just ridiculously oversized. I wouldn't have minded it if I had know beforehand, but I had it shipped to my house for my granddaughter who was visiting. The book does not fit into luggage, so now I am stuck with the book! The contents are cute and fun, but Amazon must give the reader a better description."
1,Condition of the book,The book was advartised to be in excellent condition however the binding in the book is torn almost halfway thruogh
4,Interesting look at NYC's evolution,"Josh Pais paints a vivid picture of his East Village neighborhood over the span of several decades. He chronicles not only the lives of some of the colorful charaters that make the block truly a community but also looks at his own experience as a child growing up in the ""ghetto"" and his feelings at the prospect of raising his own son in a place the police tried to quarantine from the rest of the city."
2,"Disappointing, but hey, what do you expect?","Josh Pais is a moderately talented filmmaker, and 7th Street shows some of the benefit of his experience in the industry. It's an interesting documentary, as far as it goes, but unfortunately that isn't very far.Pais lived on 7th Street for a number of years, but not during the *critical period* of 1975-1990. So, he missed out on much of the critical action. He presents gentrification as a given, as background, as back story. But, he gives few insights into why gentrification took place and why it took hold. And that's not surprising.The important ""actors"" in the gentrification drama wouldn't talk to him becauseessentially he was an outsider. Manny Schwartzenberg, the central figure in the film, played Pais like a puppet, telling him exactly what he wanted to hear ...but nothing, absolutely nothing of any importance.In summary, as a film 7th Street is interesting. As social criticism it's a failure."
2,"Sure, it's really 'real'...","Even though this documentary has lots of interesting characters and the narration is good,I didn't really remember it afterwards.Pais direction is meager to his own trials and struggles.I'm sure that if I was from his neighborhood I would feel something, but the glance this documentary provides isn't fufilling."
5,the gift of truth,"I have never been in a ""surprise child"" situation, but once I opened this book I couldn't put it down. Leslie Fields writes so compellingly and beautifully about the realities of pregnancy and birth, anyone involved in parenthood in any way will feel pierced to the heart by this book. Fields tells the true stories of many women here who have overcome the overwhelming challenges of unplanned pregnancy by clinging to hope and finding courage they didn't know they had. Hope and courage is required of all parents, but these brave women are especially inspiring. Most important, Fields gives us in this book the gift of truth. Without diminishing the wonder and joy of motherhood, she is willing to speak frankly about what any pregnancy costs in a woman's life. Women faced with the grief and pain of unplanned pregnancy will be greatly relieved to find that someone understands and is willing to speak of anger, pain, loss--yet still point the way to hope."
5,Katrina De Man,"I like Leslie Leyland Fields on any topic. I was touched and fascinated at the first page and read it through in that setting. This book is honest, poignant, raw, helpful, and rich. Though I have never had a suprise child, I've been pregnant and have heard about the unexpected from friends who run the spectrum of excited to unsure and upset. I related to this book on both those levels and feel like I've been reminded to embrace my children and not just endure them, that the growth of a child within offers the possibility and delight of my own personal growth by giving life to and loving another. This books lets you know how the author and others worked through the surprise to the joy and it helps you believe that you will, too, whatever your circumstances (even rape). This book is a good read for anyone and an excellent resource for those helping others through the unplanned pregnancy!"
4,Useful!,"I purchased this for a friend who has (@the time) a 10 month old and discovered at 17 weeks pregnant she was having a boy. Trying to help her work through her feelings of disappointment bc she wanted a girl, and help her remember God's hand in it. Also wanted to help her through this stessful journeyShe liked the book and said it was helpful"
1,New Economy Utopia meets Bardolotry,"This is one of the shoddiest books on Shakespeare I have ever read. Its basic approach is to assert some facile generalities about how free market economies help everybody and then find them in Shakespeare by means of very selective quotation. In effect, the book attempts to use the prestige of The Bard's Universal Spirit to prove or lend legitimacy to free market ideas. Its readings of Shakespeare are uninteresting. It waves away 200 years of more careful scholarship as mistaken without taking the time to provide anything like a sustained alternative reading. Worst of all, in discussing markets and economies (and nature) it consistently ignores the fact that there are sometimes losers who may not think the game has been so grand."
5,Complex and Accessible,"Mitchell's book opens up psychoanalysis to various perspectives, seeking to integrate a variety of theories without sacrificing their specificity and unique contributions.Mitchell cares deeply about pain -- so deeply, in fact, that he eschews jargon where he can, to speak to directly to laymen and experts alike. Particularly helpful here are his explorations of Hans Loewald, whose humane and idiosyncratic vision offers great comfort to those whose deepening investigation of psychonalaysis doesn't always seem to offer more enlightenment, only more confusion. Mitchell, with an eye to that confusion, finds clarity and hope."
4,A damn fine rock'n'roll act,"I actually had the luck to see a revelers show in Columbus, Ohio, and it was a dynomite show. Combining beatlesque pop with more modern rock sensibilities, the revelers produce an infectuous mix of upbeat music that everyone can ge into. This is definately qaulity stuff, check it out."
3,Cheesy,"I am an expert in the field ""Street and In Home"" safety, and was looking for an update to the older ""Are You Safe"" program (which was the modern version of ""Lady Beware"" in 1991).Unfortunately, ""Street Smart"" was not what I was hoping for. Although it contains good audio / visual, and the video ""looks"" more modern, the narration and acting is stiff and cheesy.There is some value in a few of the self defense suggestions, but I don't feel that most of the techniques are reliable, especially for the lay person."
4,Just as good as the last one,"I was completely won over by Evan and Jaron's last CD on Columbia (you can see my review of it here) and this CD just builds on that success. The six originals are catchy, melodic, and full of great harmonies. The three bonus tracks (from CDs they made in the 1990s) serve as a comparison to show just how much their songwriting and performing have grown. Bottom line: if you liked the last CD, you'll love this one."
3,Half effort.....,"I will make this very brief....because honestly there is not much to say. If you liked their last studio release, this cd will please you.....the tunes are pleasant.....melodies and vocals are good......the problem is.....there are only 9 songs!!! There should be more since they do not record that often......"
5,This CD Rocks!,"I love this whole cd. My absolute favorite is the Another Mistake. Its a great up tempo song you can really dance too. Same for What She Likes. On the slow side they have Through the Blue.Six new tracks and three tracks from prior cds. A Great bargain for a great album.If you liked, Crazy for This Girl or From My Head to My Heart, you'll love this one too."
5,"Long wait, but well worth it!","I have been a huge evan and jaron fan ever since I heard Crazy for this Girl the first time on the radio. I am hooked to their harmonies, melodies, and brillant songwriting. They truly are 2 talented, young gentlemen who deserve all the success they aspire to receive. Although, there are only 6 new tracks (and might I add they are excellent), but they also allow you to take a glimpse into their past with 3 bonus tracks off previous releases. I think this album showcases where these musicians are at this period in their life. I would recommend this one to your friends, family, co-workers and even complete strangers! An excellent investment and well worth every penny."
4,Great coffee table book,"Fast shipment on the item. Good condition, as described,very much enjoyed reading the book. The pictures are good quality. Very good price as well"
4,Not a guide as much as a cute little book,"This is a good book if you dream of going to Provence or if you've been and you're looking for something to remind you of the trip. However, if you're looking for a guide book that'll actually get you through Provence, this one lacks the depth you'll need... you'd be better off getting one of the bigger Let's Go or Fodor's guides."
3,scale?,"what scale is it? that kinda matters, ya know... the 3 stars are just there because it wouldn't let me post w/o a rating"
2,"It's okay, but not for males","Well I did enjoy reading this book. But there's one thing I didn't really care for in this book, it kept referring to the person that reads the book as a she instead of (he/she), because there are guys who actually read these books (I being one of them). The naming thing is kinda cute, but the book is very short and half of the book is made up of the names on what to name your cat. This book is nothing special I suggest you look for another book to buy."
2,not so much a book,"as a conference program. I thought there might be information on types of moustaches, with illustrations, plus a bit of history. It's just some information on a meeting of a moustache club, with bios of some of the members, and some details of who won prizes. There isn't even a complete set of pictures of the contest winners."
5,Perfect pot for two!!,"I have used my pot many times while camping over the summer and fall this year, and I absolutely LOVE it! It is easy to clean, perfect sized for two people, and who can complain with the price!? I have used it to make soup directly in the hot coals and still it held up well and cleaned up just fine. The handle is also just right for the pot to be hung from a tripod. If you love camping and a great deal on cookware, go ahead and buy this billy pot!"
2,not that funny,"I found this collection of one page comics only slightly humorous. A lot of the ""canine pranks"" seem to be repeated throughout the book. Basically I was disappointed."
1,Correct track listing,"Interesting for what it is. The correct track listing should be:1. First Song (Last Milestone)2. Jazz intercut3. Second Song (Re-Birth Day)4. Jazz intercut5. Third Song (Memories Lost And Found)6. Jazz intercut7. Fourth Song (I Can't Hurt Myself)8. Mendor9. Breaker10. PulsarBonus Tracks11. Both sides of the Vince Mariani single: Pulsar/Boots12. Re-Birth Day (single version)13. Memories Lost And Found (single version)Overall pretty raw stuff, but it was a demo that resulted in no interested labels."
2,Mariani / Eric Johnson,"(I believe) This album is an early collaberation between Grammy-winning guitar virtuoso Eric Johnson and Vince Mariani. Johnson's guitar tone is not as refined at this early stage of his career--opting for a more ""fuzzed-out"" tone reminiscent of Hendrix. The songs are fairly lengthy and feature extending (if relatively uninteresting ) improvisations.This was recorded as a demo as an attempt to generate major record-label interest.If you are an Eric Johnson-ophile, this album is necessary to round out your collection although, do I dare say it, this is not his finest work."
1,Noisiest pad ever,These are by far the worst pads Ive owned for noise They squeal so loud at times you can hear it with the windows up Im a GM technician by trade and have worked on cars for over 20 years and have to say these are garbage. Im gonna contact the company and try to get my money back before the ruin another set of rotors.
3,The Music is Fine it's . . .,"While I was happy with the purchase of this CD (Music wise),This is the second CD from an artist (their first album), where everysong is cut off short of fading out naturally. Its a very annoyingtrait, and while this isn't nearly as bad as the 1st Pablo CruiseI purchased (and had to return - it was so bad), I will be veryhesitant to buying a old 1st CD of an artist, I don't have already."
2,A must for hard-core Doobie fans that love the originals.,"This CD is classic old style Doobies. It is not well known, but folks who are re-discovering the Doobies or discovering a little ""Doobage"" for the first time will do well to have this classic CD, the Doobie Brothers' first album in your collection. It has been said that to bring them to this place, they paid their ""Doobie doos."" Famous as they are for popularizing certain geographic locations, such as ""China Grove"" (a small community outside of San Antonio TX), ""Ukiah,"" a remote town north of San Francisco, or ""South City"" (""South City Midnight Lady"") denoting a seedy section of San Francisco, (classic cuts from ""The Captain and Me""), this first release of the Doobies contains cuts on Chicago and Utah. Especially desirable is the tune ""Travelin' Man,"" which so aptly unites their classic acoustic style with a wanderlust theme that is just so right. A must have for any Doobie officianado."
3,Doobie Debut,"The Doobie Brothers got their start playing biker bars in Northern California. Their self-titled debut has a loose, hit the open road feeling. The band was just a quartet at the time and they hadn't yet developed that classic Doobie sound. The album's best cuts are ""Nobody"", ""Slippery St. Paul"", ""Travelin' Man"" and ""Beehive State"". A solid debut, but hardly their best."
5,The little known debut among the best!,"I was absolutely amazed and blown away by this little known debut that I only recently was able to find. Little is said, perhaps because it didn't yield a radio hit. But it stands up to some of their later releases that DID enjoy radio exposure. Amazing how their sound has come full circle from this album to the Michael McDonald era and back again. Perhaps a key to much of their original sound and today's return is Tom Johnston. Most definitely worth a listen. It's a keeper!"
4,Impressive Debut,"Long before Michael McDonald emasculated them, the Doobie Brothers were one heck of a rock band. The sound is so loose and laid back you might as well be sitting on Tom Johnston's front porch sipping moonshine. Every now and then you can hear, in its infancy, what would soon become the Doobies' trademark sound. While there's no particular standout track, the entire album is solid from start to finish. Highly recommended."
3,Strong debut,"If you are a hardcore Doobie Brothers fan this is an important part of their history and their development. ""Nobody"" is the template for the smooth, soulful rock that became their standard. Casual fans would be better served picking up stronger efforts in an enormous and catchy catalogue, or getting a few things you like in MP3."
4,Mixed Messages,"When I purchased this book for my husband, it was supposedly ""The Best Book"" of its kind. My husband, who flew a Huey in Vietman, enjoyed it but preferred several others of the same genre we purchased from various sellers at Amazon. However, he would recommend it."
2,"Nothing new, save your money","Nothing new presented in the book, small bibliography, and when I came upon this ""Army Group South and Luftflotte 4 consisted of 3 million men, 600,000 vehicles, 750,000 horses, 3580 tanks, 7184 guns and 1830 aircraft."" (pg. 144) I didn't know if it was for the Germans or Soviets, it would be overkill for either side in terms of 'men' alone. Instead of this book consider buying Glantz's ""Barbarossa"" or Kershaw's ""War without Garlands"", MUCH better than this book in ALL categories."
2,Disappointing after earlier book,"After reading ""Excuse me Your Life is Waiting"" I ordered the Playbook with high expectations. While I found the first book to be life transforming, I thought the Playbook was a step backwards. Too many exercises, too much wallowing in the past. Where is the excitement and the good feelings of the first book? I have been trying for about a year to get through this book, but I don't think I ever will. It just doesn't have the spark of the first book. I probably would have given this book higher marks before reading the first book, but now it pales in comparison. If you like to work hard before you get the reward this book might be what you need, but read it before ""Excuse Me, Your life is Waiting""."
3,Better than most...,"...books of this nature but a bit on the repetitive side. All in all a worthwhile read, Grabhorn distills a lot of wisdom from various traditions and schools of metaphysical thought and philosophy and makes them very accessible and appropriate for a very wide variety of folk."
5,Theraputic,"this book is a wonderful tool for discovering your behavior patterns which have held you in a constant state of creating by default, What you find out will amaze you, and make you say "" duh!!! "" why didn't I notice that before????"
2,The God of Pan?,"Wow. Interesting mix of different dieties in the Excuse me Your Life is Waiting Series....some of the exercises with ""spirit guides"" and invoking different dieties was quite interesting and confusing. It got a little wierd invoking the ""God of Pan"" and all other manner of ""Gods"" in some of the exercises...-you just have to sift through the freaky meditations and use what fits with you. The author seems to be very confused on who God is--that was the only part that bothered me. The actual meat of the book as far as utilizing the law of attraction definately and how we blame a lot of what's OUTSIDE instead of what's INSIDE US for our results in life--THAT was the part I could use!"
5,Best ever!,"Loved the book and the play book gave me even better ideas and kept me on track. After a year, I am using Lynn's ideas daily, ok hourly, have left a job from hell for me and a whole new world is before me. It's not unusual to start my day closing my eyes, letting the book flop open and smile as just what I need to read is right there. Can you say ""open valve""?"
5,Great Book!,"This is a great 'playbook' to really experience all of the ideas in Lynn Grabhorn's 'Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting' book. Lynn was a student of Esther & Jerry Hicks and she expands on the Abraham teachings with practical exercises. These exercises have the potential to liberate us from the negative programmed thinking and emotions. Everything is energy. Our emotions translate into energy that attracts and repels depending on whether we are flowing positive or negative energy. Lynn presents the work in a fun and light way. This work is life changing and I highly recommend this book."
2,Still waiting...,"I'm very anxious for my next step towards spiritual evolution, and am tired of my self-defeating habits and conditioning standing in the way. However, it's taking me so long to get throught the 271 pages of this book that I feel like my life is on hold. The clearly focused explanations, discussion material, meditations, and exercises may be essential building blocks to a new way of being, but somewhere out there my life is waiting!"
3,Too condensed,"Breezed through the book in 3 hours. To some extent it captures the main points. However, one would have a more wholesome experience by reading each of the individual books."
3,Stories on renowned CEOs,A good book with summaries of the achievements of the few best CEOs in the corporate world.
3,Know before you buy!,I purchased this product because the information provided said the images on the CD were photoshop compatable. That's only partly true. Not being a professional graphics arts person I didn't realize Photoshop won't read vector files. You have to put them through Illustrator or Freehand before you can use them directly in photoshop.We are professional photographers and provide scrapbooks as one of our products. The clip art vectors were for that and now I'm going to have to convert them before I can use them. An extra step that is costly in time.Nova needs to alter their language on their information for the novice user (like myself) that vector graphics require conversion in some software applications. At least I would have checked my program first.
2,"ART PROGRAM, CLIP ART JUNK",CRAP! MOSTLY CHEASY COLOR QUICK STAMPED TYPE OF POOR ILLISTRATIONS THERE ARE SOME LAME PHOTOS BUT THIS IS NOT WORTH THE PLASTIC ITS PRINTED ON HARD TO USE AND NOT WORTH MORE THAN $[...] GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!
1,Old and outdated collection,"This collection sucks, most of the clips are are in .tif or .wmf format making them difficult to use in modern graphic imaging software like Photoshop. The photography is out of focus and often of the ""what the heck is that supposed to be?"" category (those are in .jpg format). I DON'T recommend this collection for anyone who is looking for a good collection of clip art to be used in professional settings. In fact, I don't even recommend this product to anyone period."
2,comic book illustrations,"drawn by a 5-year old. I'm sorry, most of the vector and raster illustrations contained here are of very poor quality in my opinion. And, like some of the other reviews, I was not impressed w/ the photographs. Looks like someones bad vacation photos in spots, I counted 8 out of focus exposures of what looks like a hawk or something at great distance. Who got paid for that junk? I will keep it, but only because of the classic illustrations on a couple of the discs, and the fact I got a rebate."
3,Mediocre,Hard to sort through the clip art.Not user friendly.Artwork is disappointing and some are grainy.You get what you pay for.
1,"Repetitive, repetitive, did I say repetitive?","Repetitive, dull and exceedingly predictable!!Unless you enjoy reading about an absolutely perfect, mind-numbingly beautiful, princess who is also the tiniest person anyone has ever seen (but of course she is also perfectly proportioned and sexy all at the same time)and hearing over and over and over again about how perfect yet boring her life is in her gilded cage; don't bother with this book!"
1,So Redundant,"I was very disappointed by this book and I'm no stranger to Danielle Steel. I read most of her older books way back when and even though most of the stories are a bit predictable, they are at least entertaining. This one was a complete let down. I don't know how many times Ms. Steel had to say that Christianna hated being a princess and her father controlled her, and... it goes on. I had to skim a good deal of the book to even finish it. It was a waste of time."
3,good story... stupid ending,"I started reading this book and it was pretty good. I agree that it seems like a child wrote it, especially during ""and they made love"" part. The ending left me mad. I thought it was stupid to just end it as ""he smiled and she smiled and they lived happily ever after"".. I was very disappointed in this book.. and it had a lot of stupid parts that I just skimmed throught.. the whole story wasn't bad, it was just kinda stupid in some parts and like I said, the ending."
1,Not great,This book was a let down. It's the first book I have ever read by Danielle Steel and I hope to never read another one. It was so boring that I felt like I was wading through every page.
1,Looooooong winded drivel,"I love reading, and I actually like Mrs Steels' books very much. So when I saw this book in the local supermarket, I happily grabbed it.What a disappointment! I should have read the reviews first and saved the money... what a horrible piece of drivel. As other readers said, it's repetitive, boring, and long winded. The Royal Highness is altogether too perfect, if I ever met such a person in real life I'd scream! After the umtieth description of her boredom and what was requiered of her, I wanted to yell ""Yes I KNOW, get on with it!""And when she finally did get on with it, things didn't get better....... my advice is don't waste your money on this book, borrow it from the library instead."
1,I'm Glad It's Not Just Me,"H.R.H.I've been trying to read this book but it is SO repetitive and redundant that I'm having a hard time getting into it. It's a chore to read! I'm a quarter of the way through it and for the most part, I don't know more than I did from the first several pages.I came here to see what other readers have said and found that many others feel the same way. I'm truly concerned for those that ""loved"" it. I don't see how anyone could unless they skip pages and don't really read every one.I don't think I'll finish it. It's too boring!"
1,"Horrible, predictable and boring","I have read every Danielle Steel book. The last few have been only ok, but this one is terrible. The characters are totally one dimensional and do not represent people as much as fairy tale characters - the good princess, the good doctor, the tyrannical royal father, the dead mother, the playboy, the party girl...blah blah blah. This story is not worth reading. I should stop reading these books, but I keep hoping for a good one. I loved Family Album, The Wedding, Once in a Lifetime, Heartbreaker, Missed Blessings....but the quality took a sharp turn for the worse in the last few years. I understand from the author's dedications that she has a lot of children, but how much money do they need? Obviously with the volume of books she is putting out, quality is going to suffer."
1,OMG - soooooo bad,"Don't waste your money! Seriously, it's so bad. So boring. It got worse and worse. The two dramatic turns could be seen a mile away. At least when I started I had the hope it would get better...once it ended I was left feeling like a shmuck for buying it, let alone reading it. NOT what I expect from Ms Steel. I'm shocked they allowed her to publish it. Did anyone else notice the grammar errors? The repeating of things, word for word? I can't remember the last time I've read a book I hated so much. Maybe never. I normally don't keep reading, but I was so mad to have splurged on it....I ignored the inner screams of despair. DON'T SUFFER THE SAME FATE! I gave one star only because Amazon won't allow ZERO."
2,BORING!!!,Did Danielle really write this? It seems like it was written by an adolescent girl. I thought it might get better but it never did. I'm glad this was a library book.
1,Not worth the time or money,I usually like Danielle Steele but the characters in this book are boring and one-dimensional. I loved the cover and the plot had so much potential but Ms. Steele just didn't deliver.
3,Not her best...,I have read several of Steel's books and this is really not her best. The story is predictable and kind of boring. I really dont recommend it.
1,Couldn't finish it,"I only got through about the first fifty pages or so. After Ms. Steele tells us for the umteenth time that the heroine is a ""goodie two shoes"" and her brother is the trouble maker--we get it already. Move on to the plot. Not fast-paced enough for me. I didn't bother to finish. It seemed like there was too much ""page-filling"" going on here."
4,Turned out to be pretty good!,"I was kind of annoyed in the beginning because she made Christianna seem extremely perfect, she was good at EVERYTHING. Come on even royals aren't perfect. I kept reading though in hopes that it would get better and thankfully it did! I loved the romance and couldn't put it down the second half. I agree though that some parts were rather repetitive."
4,Can it be??,"An enjoyable Danielle Steel book after so many disappointments? I'm SO excited! I really loved this book, and while I could not relate to the story of a princess, I could relate to the feelings of deep love and loss that she experienced in the book. You also get to appreciate that maybe being royal isn't all it's cracked up to be.I really found this to be a page-turner. I was curious to see how it would all end. As far as repetition, I don't think this book was repetitive at all - maybe a few spots, but nowhere near what I'm used to with her books of late.I just got her perfume for my birthday (very nice!). My husband said he rolled his eyes while picking it out when the sales lady said ""She writes books too."" He just said ""Yes, I know.""Great book! Anxiously looking forward to the next Danielle Steel book!Welcome back, Danielle - we missed you!"
2,hrh,"I was very disappointed with the ending of this new Danielle Steel. It seemed like a very long read, with a very quick ending. I have read every one of her books, and have never been so disappointed with a story until now. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,Disappointed,"I thought maybe Danielle Steele was getting back to the basics of her original books after her last couple books, but unfortunately that was not the case. This book was a disappointment. It was not believable and just plain boring. It took me three weeks to finish it because I kept setting it down to read something else that was better. I'd go back to it thinking maybe it would get better...it didn't. Skip this particular book."
4,Easy Reading,"This was my first Danielle Steele novel. I couldn't put it down. I enjoyed the story line of the royals. If the royals interest you, you definitely want to read this book. The ending was predictable, but how it comes about is a surprise. I am new Danielle Steele fan!"
2,"Interesting plot, very predictable!","This was the first Danielle Steel novel I've read, I was less than impressed. Entire plot was repetitive and cheesy and characters were all rather flat. Cricky had some interesting development but seems like a perfect barbie princess."
3,Do Steele's readers have Alzheimers?,"I agree with Mommabookworm. There is so much repetition in this book, I wonder if Steele thinks she's writing for Alzheimers sufferers who can't remember what they read two pages ago. Otherwise, it's an entertaining story. I just wonder what the real royals of Lichtenstein would think about it?"
1,H.R.H,Do not borrow or buy this book. It is actually one of the worst book of this genre I have ever read....actually I did not read it all. I was bored out of my wits way before reaching half of the book.
3,"Good, but cookie cutter","I listened to this book on tape. The reader was excellent to listen too. The beginning was slow to get into to, but midway thru the 2nd CD - my interest was captured. I wish I could have heard more of their story after the book was over. The characters are stereotypical - princess is perfect, father is controlling, prince is terrible, and boyfriend is perfect too. It's less a story of how she fell in love but more on how the love conflicts with her duty."
2,"Not very exciting, predictable and boring too.","Not the best DS book, in fact in would be in my bottom 5. You knew exactly what had to happen in order to have the fairy tale ending all DS books have. Choose another DS book."
2,"Redundant, Boring. My Worst of 2007","Who WROTE this? Surely it isn't the same woman who wrote Message From Nam. And if it was, why were the copy editors asleep on it? There were several paragraphs that were maddeningly redundant. Repetitious. And to add insult to injury, the author (or drunk editor?) decided it would be cool to redescribe the same things pages later, just as redundantly as before. There were several sentences that were so poorly written that any high school english teacher would have cringed. Me? I just tripped over them. The characters were BORING. The scenery? Nondescript. The plot had far more potential than it was given. Was this one of Danielle's very first books recovered and remarketed? Cut out the redundant fluff and you have a Harlequin dime store book. I am VERY disappointed that I bought this at full price."
1,Just the worst,"I've lost count of how many Steel books I've read, but this one was the worst. It was like I've heard and read all this on the news. Poor bored Christiana ... just has to do her part for mankind. The author just goes on and on ... okay we get the picture. Danielle Steel is a great author, but it reminded me of a recent news story that she just quickly threw a book (and the 'cause') together while the story was hot. Come on Danielle, you can do better than this."
3,Nightingales,"This CD has some old quartet music. Some of it pretty good, but most before my time. I think Nightingale fans and quartet lovers will enjoy this CD."
4,Expectations meet :O),I have search for this album and now am able to enjoy it. Thank you for your speedy response to my request.
3,A pre-war gentle mystery story with a satisfying ending.,"The residents of Craddock House, now turned into apartments, are nearly all related to each other, but do not all like one another. The murder victim was least liked and there are several suspects, but the hero and heroine are cleared by the discovery of the most unlikely murderer."
4,"Not ALL Killer, But Killer","The rootical dubs here are so hard that this is a four star album despite the presence of a few electro bullcrap riddims. There are even some of those cool spoken intros like on Black Ash, Scientist vs. Jammy, etc."
5,A great value,"I purchased this knife so I could have something to easily transport from my kitchen to other family member's kitchens, since it comes with a knife sheath. For the cost of the knife, it is a great value. It has a full tang and is balanced well. It's a very nice, moderately-priced knife, as are the others in the same collection."
5,Every kid should have this book,I was given this book when I was a kid(um teen years ago) I still have the original but after years of use and love it was falling apart and I did not want it to get totally destroyed so I bought a replacement for my son. This book is such a fun book for a kid. It has so many ideas and information in it. It will keep them busy for hours.
5,I'm so glad this book is still around!!,"Like other reviewers, I received this book as a child and pored over every page (and did most of the projects) a hundred times! I'm now in my mid-thirties and will be introducing my kids to this classic. Every page was clearly and simply illustrated, the instructions were easy to follow, and it was just a whole lot of fun. Most of all, it stoked a curiosity and a thirst for this kind of hands-on learning. This is truly an essential title, even (or maybe especially) for people who do not have children of their own - you can be a super-cool aunt/uncle/grandparent/neighbor if you whip this one out and get a fun project started. And don't let the suggested age range fool you - I remember completely loving this book long past eight years old."
4,"Got mine at a garage sale, now buying from Amazon for others!","While a bit dated and The statistic listed are a bit skewed since the surveys on alternative livestyles were done in San Franciso, I love the wealth of information in this book. While it is likely wonderful for beginners, I found that even after 12 years of a healthy relationship with my wife, this book has added depth to the knowledge we have aquired through practical application.This book is like an almanac, listing statistics and definitions for just about everything. It describes physiological reactions to intercourse, broken out by male and female (did you know we sweat in different places when we peak?) and even offers alternative positions for those with bad backs, pregnant bellies, or weak legs."
4,LA Times Review,"Traveling with diabetes can be a challenge. To help, Los Angeles attorney Marilyn L. Garcia, who has insulin-dependent diabetes has written ""Diabetic Travel Tales and Tips.""It's not the typical don't-forget-your-insulin-supplies guide. Instead, Garcia and other diabetics write about traveling despite having the disease. ""I tried to make it fun and practical,"" Garcia says. ""As a diabetic, I'd gotten into a lot of scrapes that were amusing and I survived.""The book also contains practical information, such as adjusting insulin doses to changes in time zones, dealing with airport security, scheduling meals and buying medicine at foreign destinations.Reviewed by Kathleen Doheny of the LA Times on 7/31/05 page L3"
1,Not nearly as good,"We got a set of Dansk Torun in 1999; it was a beautiful and functional set We wanted to get some additional sets, so we got this.These are amazingly inferior. Some of it is just quality: the spoons are shallower and have sharp edges. That's just cheaper forging. To add insult to inury, they also have a new shape which I don't like as well. The knife is similar to the original, but not as elegant.If I'd known Dansk was going to do this I don't think I would have bought from them 10 years ago. I certainly can't recommend this set now."
1,"Now Made In China, and Inferior","I had the EXACT same experience as the previous reviewers. I purchased this beautiful, and not cheap, flatware in the late 1980's. I loved it. After years of ""kids"", many pieces had ""walked away"" so I ordered some replacements. The difference in quality was truly stunning. This was the first time I really began to understand that the flight to Chinese manufacturing (read: cheaper manufacturing costs), was also a flight to inferior products. The spoons were not rounded on the edges; they were flat and sharp. The luster was not there, the weight was lighter, and overall the flatware had a ""cheap"" look to it when compared to the original. Honestly, you should get what you pay for. I replaced it all with Ricci and have not been disappointed. Caveat Emptor - buyer beware."
3,"good, but important flaws","This is my first smartphone, and my expectations were high, that is why I give it a 3 stars. It does have a good performance, and now that I am used to it I cannot live without it (but I would switch to a phone that would solve the ""bugs"").Problems:1. there is no way to connect to a wifi by itself, and then use all applications as you like (web, e-mail, etc). You have to connect to a wifi using an application.2. The phone freezes very often, and as there is no ctrl-alt-del and not even the on-off button will work, I have to remove the battery and then restart the phone.3. Not a lot of software available for Symbian OS.4. For those that are used to Palm OS, the basic applications are sub-standardMaybe next version of it will solve some of these problems."
5,Review of nokia E61,"One of the best phones I have usedPros: The wi-fi is good, big screen, very good visibility and colour resolution and also the help functions are really great.Cons: Some downloaded games, freezes the phone and its bulky"
