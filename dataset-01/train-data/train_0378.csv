1,one of the worst ever,"This movie is a total piece of...! The director is so self important. The story is even worse than Boogie Nights. Tom Cruise's performance is unimaginative and overrated. The frogs are about the worst thing I have ever seen on film. An absolute joke of a movie. Please, please save your money so as to save yourself 3 hours of agony and hopefully prevent this director from making any more films."
1,"pretentious, boring mess...",this movie is a hodgepodge of ridiculous religious symbolism and overwrought melodrama. intense profanity masquerades as dialogue with actors often screaming obscenities at the top of their lungs for no apparent reason. The frogs falling from the sky is stolen from an X-Files ep and the intertwining stories seem lifted from Robert Altman's MUCH superior movies. a wildly overpraised movie that will leave you with an intense headache from its length and volume as well as three hours gone from your life. avoid at all costs.
1,"Run, do not walk, as far away from this movie as you can","I wish I had the three hours of my life back that I wasted on this movie. The characters are unsympathetic and uninteresting. The opening works hard to set up some big cosmic payoff that will link all the lives and coincidences together into something coherent, but it never happens. Tom Cruise's character is ludicrous and Julianne Moore is literally unwatchable. And then there's the frogs. Somehow, nothing says that the director didn't know where to go with the film quite like having really big frogs falling from the sky. The best thing about this movie is that Aimee Mann did the music and the only truly excellent scene in the whole 3 hours is the few seconds where all the characters (even the unconscious ones) sing along to one of her songs."
5,compelling,"magnolia is a mosaic of human life that tells of several diffrent stories in l.a. that all seem to center around a talk show called ""what do kids know?"". the sotrys consist of a dying cancer patient, his male nurse, and his trophy wife. a sex guru with a hidden past. a talk show host, a child protegie an dhis selfish dad. a former game show winner suffering from unreqainted love. and the last, a coked out girl playing hot and cold with a cop. all these stories, under anderson's control, are carefully woven together that leads to a shocking end were it promises to rain something other then rain. everyone gives a great performence even tom cruise, who lately has fallen on hard times due to his antics but this film made me forget all that and it proved to me that cruise, despite his antics, is a good actor. so, if you loved anderon's other film boogie nights, then you'll love this film."
5,Film-making at its best,"***intertwining plots-characters' stories are inter-related and go back and forth throughout the movie, very clever, interesting and well done..brilliant directing*unforgettable characters-all Oscar worthy*3 hours, but never a dull moment; fast-paced, indulging scene changes throughout movie*shocking ending*ammmazing music...i thought the first song went especially well with what was going on in this movie.......and when the cocaine addict was blasting her music-that sequence*many memorable scenes, twists, witty humor, Magnolia will stay with you forever"
3,blah,"Although the Hollywood critics may laud this movie, it is way too disjointed to be enjoyed without watching it several times. I'm guessing. I don't have the strength to watch it again. The previews made it look like such a good movie...even the previews tho, have a more consistently flowing plot than the movie itself. With so many characters [all of whom use inappropriately excessive profanity] that are used to try to make a ""deep"" plot, they all end up pitiful and shallow. The cop is the only one who has anything remotely resembling depth...all the depth the other characters have is contrived. I give the cast 4 stars for acting well to poorly written rles. 5 stars for the extra DVD of special features, 2 stars for the story and only 1 star for the disjointed plot."
4,"Superb, but...","*As with all of my DVD reviews, I do not review the quality of the movie but the quality of the DVD*If you like the movie, you'll love most of the DVD. Then you'll probably be left scratching your head over why there is no commentary track. This is tragic, because the Boogie Nights commentary was so good. All of the other features are of high quality, especially the documentary, which is superb and long. Sound and picture are very good.ac"
4,From Hard Eight On It Keeps Getting Better,"P.T. Anderson once again shows his brilliance. With another Phillip Baker Hall(The Insider, Hard Eight) team-up Magnolia was a brilliant Altmanesc story of one day in the valley. Astounding fast pace directing and fantastic performances make this a runner-up for the best picture of 99' next only to ""Being John Malkovich"". This is proof that the indy scene is where you look for future talant. Let's just hope it's financial failiure doesn't discourage P.T."
5,A Truly Enjoyable Masterpiece,"High Praise must be given to this film. The greatly intwined plot deserves much credit and the actors played their roles quite superbly. The woven plot alone makes this movie slow at first, but once you start to figure out how the characters are connected to one and all, it triumphs. From the wiz kid to the old man to the cop to everyone and back again....what a ride. I don't wan't to ruin it for anybody but just remember the word FROGS. You may now applaud."
3,falls apart midway through,"Starts well enough but falls apart half way through. Watch ""Short cuts"" if you wanna see a good 3 hr movie about LA . This ones worth a rental but not $21."
1,"Gorgeous, but . . .","Yes, it's a greatly crafted film, but I'm just f___g sick and f___g tired of hearing the ""f"" word every other f___g sentence, especially for three hours."
1,"AWARD FOR THE MOST TIMES THE ""F"" WORD IS USED!","THE ""F"" WORD COMPRISED MOST OF THE DIALOGUE.I'VE NEVER HEARD IT SO UNENDINGLY REPEATED.I GOT THE FEELING THAT THIS ""PLOY"" WAS CONSIDERED AVANT GARDE OR COOL AT THE TIME THE MOVIE WAS MADE. IT WAS VERY IRRITATING.I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED IN ROBARD'S PERFORMANCE.HIS DIATRIBE TOWARDS THE END WAS OBNOXIOUS AND AGAIN, USING THE F WORD AS EVERY OTHER WORD, WAS RIDICULOUS.I DON'T LIKE TOM CRUISE, BUT I MUST SAY THAT HIS PERFORMANCE IN THIS, IS PROBABLY THE MOST INTERESTING AND WELL DONE THAN THE REST OF THE CHARACTERS.I ALSO LIKED JOHN C. REILLY'S PERFORMANCE AND FELT THE MOST SYMPATHY FOR HIM.THIS FILM WAS ALSO WAY TOO LONG."
1,The longest three hours ever,"After a whizbang opening that really gets your hopes up, Magnolia rapidly becomes unwatchable. You, the viewer, get treated to a 10 minute version of ""One is the Lonliest Number"" (at earshattering volume), a seemingly endless parade of pathetic, one-dimensional losers who are impossible to care about, an actual music video (! ), two major characters dying of cancer, and finally an EVENT which is supposed to tie everything together in some sort of profound way (it doesn't.) PT Anderson seems like too nice a guy to tell his actors to tone things down. I can't remember the last time I saw so much hammy acting: everybody is crying and screaming and/or cursing all of the time. Anderson is great at moving the camera, and he has a good eye for lighting and composition. He would make a wonderful commercial director. And the special effects during the EVENT are a lot of fun to watch. After watching this film I really appreciated what Robert Altman accomplished with ""Short Cuts""."
1,i'd rate it lower if i could,"This movie was trying to make a point that could have been done in half an hour, or in that actual first 10 minutes of the movie. I'd watch the dvd again to see if i missed any other points but i'd rather be at the dentist for 3 hours.Anderesen is a failed wanna be Quentin Tarantino, atleast Tarantino keeps you interested."
1,When Hollywood makes a movie about ... NOTHING !,"When you see the casting, you just expect a great movie and I guess the acting is the only thing positive in it.When the movie starts in a really cool and interesting way and when you know that you have 3 hours movie to watch, you just think ""What a great moment I am ready to enjoy"". The problem is that everything is turning out and you finally get bored after half an hour.The story is about .... Love, Pride, Hope ... and it's completely flat, flat, flat ! It just happens nothing except a frog rain at the end that also means nothing ! It's for sure one of the most boring movies of my life. The one star rate is really for the actors only ! The rest is garbage !"
1,I Loved This Movie,"I thought it was a phenominal film...All was well except the beginning and the end. The middle was acceptable. Though there was room for much improvement. Furthermore, it was too long. The performances were so so, I would say the most notable performance came from the blackjack dealer during the opening sequence, kudos to him!!! The rest of the acting was merely average at best. I won't be watching this again anytime soon! However it remains to be one of my favorite films of all time! Comparable to Casablanca and Dude Where's My Car?"
5,another great film by Paul Thomas Anderson,"wow!!! it was gripping, heartfelt, and very much sad..this is one of the best films i have seen it is a near master piece.with such a great cast.. im no big fan of tom cruise but he did a great job in this film.. it would take me too long to tell u ABOUT the story, so lets just say everything is connected in one way or another..a great film from the director of boggie nights, and punch drunk love..Rater R for, Strong Language, Drug Use, Some Violence, Adult Content, Some Nudity, and Some Sexual Content"
1,In Running for Worst Movie of All Time,"I dont mind filmakers taking risks - I'll take an ambitious but flawed film over the typical Hollywood grist mill anyday BUT Magnolia has got to be the worst most incomprehensible film in recent memory. The pretentiousness, overacting and sheer wwfullness of this film sets a standard that is hard to follow. The same acting contingent which gave a professional and enjoyable performance in Boogie Nights is reduced to a shrill, gasping ensemble trying to make some sense out of...nothing. Trying to pass it off as some kind of arthouse piece is the final insult to the audience which has to sit through this 3 hour mess to begin with."
2,"Visually beatiful, but...","...overall deceiving. I think this is another example (like Matrix and others) of an amazingly produced movie with almost no content at all. Maybe visual effects are a new form of art in itself, but I wish movies were still ""movies"", in the first place."
2,untasteful,"Film makers like this one wants to celebrate ugliness of humanity by creating movies with messed up people. Some do a decent job while movies like this do it in an untasteful way. For example, in this movie, you will hear children use the f word and cuss like ugly adults. We all know some kids do that in real life, but I do not believe children actors should cuss like that for a movie, which is simply a form of entertainment. I think film makers should use discretion while trying to show the realities of life.All in all, if you really want to hear the f word 100 times (I think it was about 100 times), go ahead and watch and enjoy the ugliness of humanity. I really think this is an overrated film. It's one of those films that are really innovative and people like it because its idea. To me, movie has limitations in showing realities of life. Movies are for entertainment, and this one was not a good one."
1,Watch Magnolia or watch paint dry.......you decide,"I knew basically nothing about this movie when it began and was fairly excited for a noteworthy cast to deliver a respectable performance. I think it's safe to say I took my first nap appx. 30 minutes into the movied when I realized it was going absolutely nowhere. For the next 2+ hours (that seemed like 2+ days) I drifted in/out of conciousness. Waking up here and there to some occasional frogs, and other sad stories all converging in one big mess called magnolia. Avoid this movie like a bad stomach bug."
1,Havent seen a worse film yet..,Seeing Magnolia made me realize why i didnt like Boogie Nights either. PT Anderson has got to be the most self indulgent director the 90's has produced - at least if his movies had any meaning deeper than what you could see on any episdoe of MTV's Real World this wouldnt be such a fatal problem - charachters cursing and having hysterics to convey deep emotion doesnt cut it. The actors are all over the map in terms of their skills - Tom Cruise does well if the writing for his character wasnt so bad and the Singing Scene and Frog Scene are unintentionally hysterical but unless you fast forward thru the movie you have to sit through 3 hours of this mess to see them.
1,The Emperor Has No Clothes,"Read all of the five star reviews if you don't believe me. None of the reviewers get this film, so they default to the ""brilliant"" rating. This really is a film student's wet dream and that's about it. This flick reminds me of many of the songs from the late sixties, all fluff and no substance. Write about flying purple elephants and all the nomads need to attach some absurd, satirical existentialist meaning to it.I have lived in the SF Valley my whole life and yes I've known people like those in this film. So what, they are not worth knowing long. Whine, whine, whine, everyone has a sad story. I was hoping for them all to kill themselves by hour two. By hour three I was searching for a gun.Use the three hours you would waste on this film productively. Read a great book instead. Want something with real depth about the scum in LA? I recommend ""Day of The Locust"" by Nathanael West."
1,Yikes!,This movie really insults the intelligence. I guess PT Andersen doesnt really think you can get his art so he hits you over the head relentlessly - Oh the emotion! You know this is a deep movie because people are screaming and cursing all over the place. The emotional high point is the group sing along (Aimee Mann shouldnt take any blame for this) - where you start laughing and you realize that it wasnt supposed to be funny. And a 2 Disc DVD release....Ah..the pretentiousness!
4,What do I have in common with God,"What do I have in common with God? Apparently, in PT Anderson's world, a steel bond made of the ugliest chain one could ever see. I liked this movie and found it very interesting. I'm still unable to decide if the frog thing was a copout. Does anyone know if he intended to end the movie like that, or if he had the idea but was unsure how to bring it all together. It was interesting anyhow. Why, however, would God care for all these dispicable people who can only come to grip with reality when frogs fall from the sky. Can humans come together only if we know there is something watching us? Otherwise are we self loathing specimen? Is that the point?"
1,I HAVE NOW SEEN THE STUPIDEST MOVIE EVER MADE!,"The cast of Boogie Nights does the most depressing movie since the Passion Of The Christ. If you don't feel like being entertained by a movie, and want to be bored, upset, depressed and otherwise SICK, watch this [...] One of the worst ever."
1,Hard to follow and boring,The plot (if you call it that) was dull and hard to follow. The characters weren't believable and the constant playing of music throughout the movie gave me a headache.Would have given it a 2 star if they removed all the crappy music.
1,I'm sorry...,"I know that many people love this movie, but...well...I hated it. So did everybody I saw it with. Except one guy, who loved it. But he wasn't able to convince any of the rest of us."
3,Stupid Near Ending With Large Frogs Falling Out From The Sky,"I really liked this movie until near the ending where for some dumbo reason large frogs started falling out the sky. Really dumb, not to mention gross. This coming from one who has seen his large share of stupid movies amd dumb scenes but this one takes the cake. I mean, how difficult would it have been to have the same scenes be more realistic (and in line with the rest of the movie) with hail, say, the size of baseballs, or even softballs falling from the sky? I think I'll edit it myself with my software editing programs."
1,Worst movie I ever spent the time to watch,"Although many people gave this movie 5 stars I don't even want to give it 1 star. This was the most mixed up movie I have ever seen. It jumped all over the place, I did not understand what was going on, it was very weird. I have see hundreds of movies and I can usually find some good in a movie until I seen this one, which I could not force myself to watch until the end."
4,"No answers, just wierdness","This isn't really one story; like so many films of the period, it attempts to connect a series of loosely intersected lives, with a lot of strangeness and bizarre occurances thrown in for....what??? I don't think the director's intention was to provide answers, and I certainly didn't feel like I got any. But that's OK. There's enough going on to keep my interest through a couple of viewings already, and I'd watch it again. Cruise and other well-known actors give strong performances, and the movie is visually intriguing, if rather dark. The title seems to bear no relation to anything in the movie; if you figure it out, let me in on it, OK? I liked ""Magnolia"", it's has just the right mix of realism and wierdness to keep my interest, and the fact that there didn't seem to be any point doesn't bother me at all."
4,A rare film that grows on you,"Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" is one of the most powerful, intersecting, and profane movies I've ever seen. I had mixed feeling about it the first time I saw it, considering it's back-and-forth emphasis on various characters, as well as its language and occassional startling elements. Eventually, though, the film started to grow on me. To me, it's not only a film about the notions of coincidence versus destiny, but about the effects of past sins on a future generation, and about the choices each of us makes in our lives. Again, it's a powerful portrayal, yet it paints a fascinating and compelling picture of peoples' rises and falls, redemption, despair, and the Biblical-related theme of intersection. Well-crafted and brilliantly-acted, along with a terrific score by Jon Brion (""Punch-Drunk Love,"" ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") and songs by Aimee Mann."
5,"Mesmerizing, creative, unique art","A fantastic film full of creativity and wonder. The performances delievered by Magnolia's cast far and away surpass any collective effort in recent memory.Although I gave this film five stars, it's mainly due to a personal preference. I can understand how someone may not ""get"" this movie, but for fans of art, Magnolia's a can't-miss."
4,Not Strange....just art.`,"OK...many people have said that this movie is weird or confusing. I say it is movies like Magnolia that seperate movie fans into two categories: those who are willing to think during a movie and those who just want to sit back and be entertained. I think that Magnolia was a brilliant movie full of symbolism and art. If you want a light, easy-to-watch movie, this is not the one for you. If, on the other hand, you don't mind to think and take in the symbolism, sit back and relax...you're gonna love it."
5,Exciting and full of emotion,"This movie is one of the best movies I have come across. It is exciting and full of emotion, providing more character depth. As a reviewer said, that Magnolia is a 3 hour trip about 8 characters lifes, yes that is true, and the same goes with books, how it's trying to develop a character. This movie not only develops one but also goes deep within their emotions and how some change, stay the same, or are enlightened. I know there are other movies that do this too, but how can other movies show 8 characters lifes in 180 minutes without making the audience seem as they are being cheated emotionally. Magnolia does it in such a precise way."
4,"Watch it all at once, or check out scenes","Sure, there's a music video stuck in the middle of it, and yeah, it's pretentious. But PT Anderson creates engaging scenes and dialogue (watch Henry Gibson at the bar) and pulls you all over the place. Guess what? It's a fun ride.It's possible to be a fan of Altman and enjoy this movie. In fact, go watch Short Cuts or Nashville right after watching this.It's also not for everyone. It's dark and it meanders and be advised that it's profane. That's what the R rating means. Watch it, then go check out Hard Eight and Boogie Nights and watch for the same camera tricks PT Anderson has been using since his first film. Coffee anyone?"
5,Paul Thomas Anderson's magnificient ensemble.,"Paul Thomas Anderson knows a thing or two about homages. His second feature,Boogie Nights, was built around an ensemble cast. He taught himself from the likes of Robert Altman (Nashville,Short Cuts - Criterion Collection), and in some ways passed the great director.Magnolia is the story of nine interlocking characters, whose, in one day in LA, lives change.This is a wonderful movie. One of the best of the year, in a very good year by the way.This two disc set includes deleted scenes, featurettes, Aimee Mann's video, and a number of other things.Must Have."
1,Hunh? What the hell was that about?,"My roomate and I set down to watch this movie, and we were jazzed after the first few minutes showing little sequences of coincidence. I thought this was going to be great. A few story lines that all tie into one big ending. Oh I was pumped. Three hours later... a waste of my freaking time. Imagine someone taking an episode of Family Ties (one of the ""Very Special Episodes"",) a bad Trapper John M.D. episode and a cable access program, splicing them all together so as they jump around and none of them have an ending that relates to anything else, and you have just made the sequel to Magnolia. Save your money, buy a can of paint, pour it onto your floor, watch it dry then clean it up. That is much less a waste of time than watching this flick. Almost as bad as English Patient (that is saying a lot.)"
1,pointless pretentious garbage,proof that if you try hard enough to make something as dull as possible there will be a sizeable part of the population that will consider it art.there is only one redeeming feature - the end
1,Maybe I missed something...,"I thought this movie was god awful. I sincerely enjoyed Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"", so I was very excited about this movie and wanted to like it. No chance. It bored me to tears. Seriously, can anyone tell me they enjoyed the 3+ hours that led up to the ridiculous ending of this movie? C'mon! The dialogue is tedious and it just tries way too hard. I have no problem with a movie that really has no sensible conclusion or plot, but it's got to be compelling and at least say something along the way. This stinks!"
1,OH What promise-- Oh what a mess!,"This movie ranks as one of the biggest failures ever. After sitting through 2.5 hours of helter skelter excitement, I turned to my wife, and said ""This movie could now end a million different ways"". I think any one of these million ways would have been OK- But the makers of this movie chose number 1,000,001. The entire frog thing is someone on the director or producer seat with a drug fantasy, or perhaps they wanted to laugh at the silly people like me who rented it. Unless you revel in the absurd, please don't waste your time."
1,...,"...The start of the movie is enticing enough for you to sitthrough it. When the stars started the karaoke and everyone in the movie begins to reveal themselves that when the mess begins. One reviewer commented about lack of closure, I think he's right. The story could have been told in less than two hours. By the first hour, an average viewer would already have an idea of the characters. PT Anderson thinks the viewers are dumb enough not to understand the characterization hence the long movie...waste of time!"
3,"An introduction for me, to Aimee Mann","The movie itself is a bit too melodramatic and ""self-congratulatory"", as others have said. However, I own the soundtrack, and THAT is something worth buying."
2,You can throw paint at a wall...die...and be called a genius,"This random amalgamation of events and people had several good moments and does cause one to reflect on the chaos that is life, that part was about 20 minutes of the movie. Random things happen...I randomly paid 7.00 for a movie that left me gasping for plot, meaning and reason.In the end the viewer is left wanting back 3 hours of life,...the joke is on us."
1,I want my 3 1/2 hours back!,"I have thrown money away before, but this really hurt. I don't want my 8 bucks back nearly as much as I want those 3 and one half hours back in my life. I was at the movies staring at the screen with incredulity, and all I could think was that I wasted 8.50 on this piece of celluloid refuse. I felt more sorry for these two elderly women who looked back at me with confusion, seeking an explanation of what incontinent drivel they had just witnessed. I could not help these poor women and felt really bad for them since I know they must be on a fixed income and shelled out cash for this THIRD effort by a talented writer director, who has two awesome films under his belt. WHAT HAPPENED????I can only hope that Anderson wakes up and goes back to making a really good film like he did with Boogie Nights and Hard Eight. Either one will be worth owning."
1,It's easy to write one-star reviews ...,"... so I'll just make this one brief without hyperventilating: ""Magnolia"" is an overwritten movie with under-developed characters. Reviewers comparing Anderson to Robert Altman should remember that even Altman stumbled with ""Brewster McCloud"" after the success of ""M*A*S*H"" for the same reasons. There's no magic here -- the movie is just plain excessive, and too indulgent for its own good."
1,i DID NOT like this movie.,"this movie got on my nerves. i love julianna moore. she was good in this part, but it didn't make the movie any better. the ending was anticliamtic. the movie was too long and just made me bored. i could not get into this movie at all. don't waste 3 hours of your time. stay away from this movie at all cost. unless you just want to waste time."
1,Shall I say sucks big time!!!!!!!,"It was pure agony watching most of this film.I dont even know why i even finished it,other than a glimmer of hope that there would be a good scene.The only thing I liked was the scenes about that streetcop's relationship.I think that the whole movie should have been about him.Tom Cruise's character was a real odd one and I think he's to good of an actor to waste his talent on a yawn fest like this one.Don't waste one red cent on this movie,you will thank me later."
1,Worst movie ever made?,I don't know for sure - I haven't seen them all. Worst movie I've ever seen? Without a doubt. This movie was so bad and so annoying I don't even want to talk about it. Just wanted to give a warning to the unsuspecting.
2,A compelling film but not for everyone,"This a movie you either love or hate. We almost stopped the movie, but then decided to give it a chance. The best actor was the girl who was molested by her father. She is a wonderful actress and did a supurb job with her part. I have such mixed feelings about this film. It was bizarre as well as compelling... and I made it through the entire film. The foul language might be offensive to some. I don't think I would see the film again...once is enough. It made me very nervous and uncomfortable at times. Where does the title ""Magnolia"" come from? I must have missed the connection in the movie. Also, the frogs were horrible... biblical meaning or not, I was disgusted. I can't say anything bad about the acting, because everyone did a great job, but the movie was not what I expected and it was quite long."
2,Decidedly disappointing,I adored Boogie Nights and thought the cast and director could only top it. Unfortunately this was not the case. It was too long and bloated. Some of the scenes and characters were very engaging but the interlinked stories did not add up to anything desperately interesting and the build up did not lead to a decent climax.You cannot beat 2 DVD disc special additions for learning about a film inside and out. The second disk seemed to reveal a pretty amateur produtcion effort. I wish it was better but it wasn't. Take a look at something else.
5,one of my top 5 favorite films of all time,I can't say enough about this film---it's got everything and is presented artfully. Just get it and watch it with an open heart. It's amazing.
5,spoiler patrol,"If you're interested in seeing this brilliant and riveting intertwining of lost and pained souls, then don't read most of the reviews here.The film has an awesomely disorienting scene toward the end that will be totally ruined for you by some of these reviews."
3,A film by P.T. Anderson. Need we say more? :),This is classic Paul Thomas Anderson. He offers an interplay of interesting characters and you just stand back and enjoy the spectacle as their lives clash and intertwine. I couldn't help be fascinated by their stories. I'd recommend this movie as a rental. It was interesting but it's not a film I'm anxious to see again and again.
2,oh how my bottom aches,"Straight to the point, this film is overrated. Over ambitiousis the best way to describe Andersons work. Boogie Nights would have been perfect if the last half hour had been cut, but with Magnolia he would have needed a pair of garden shears. What exactly was he hoping to achieve here? You never suspect for one moment that the movie will culminate with a reasoned and satisfactory ending. Its messy throughout. I felt itchy just watching it. Am i the only one who squirmed as the cast sang the aimee mann track?Some of the characters and scenarios were interesting, and as ever, William H Macy gave us a watchable portrayal of a man struggling to come to terms with middle age. But its no answer as to how this film ever got the go-ahead.Yes, we all like films like this, films that are different,challenging,thought provoking and over long! But still,i would be lying if i said this was anything more than a pile of over-indulgent porridge. Mr Anderson! Length doesnt signify art! END"
4,Magnolia,"I found this movie to be both disturbing and captivating at the same time. The only other movie I can remember that left me with such a ""thick"" feeling was ""The Deer Hunter."" Like that film from the 1970's, this cinematic effort breaks new ground with its disjointed, short story approach to moviemaking. Once the various tales start to merge, everything becomes clear. Well, sort of. I found it to be mesmerizing. The performance rendered by Tom Cruise alone makes the film worth the price."
3,"Good film, Bad DVD","I liked Magnolia in the theatre. I even like how frustrated I was when I got out of the theatre. But I hate this DVD.PT Anderson's DVD of Boogie Nights came with a running commentary and deleted scenes. I learned so much more about what this film is about. This DVD comes with NO commentary, just a TERRIBLE hour-long documentary that's nothing more than patches of video tape footage spliced together. You can't learn anything.If I could, I'd return the DVD and buy the VHS at the lower price. Or better, rent the VHS a few times, and then wait for the ""real"" collectors edition to come out (Anderson just released a 2-disc set of Boogie Nights that's even better than the original, oh well there goes another $25)."
1,Don't waste your time with this movie,"This movide is pure crap. It's vulgar, lacks plot and absolutely no talent is displayed by any one."
1,Pretentious and self-indulgent.,"This movie....ugh. Would somebody mind explaining to me the allure ofthis movie? Wait, would somebody who has seen Robert Altman's SHORTCUTS and Todd Solondz' HAPPINESS mind telling me what the allure ofthis movie is? Original it ain't.Anyone who has seen theaforementioned movies knows darn well that ... Anderson cribbed somany elements from both movies it is PATHETIC. Save for Tom Cruise'sperformance, Anderson manages to waste a lot of talent with his clichedialogue and self-gratifying camera moves (totally unmotivated andobvious), never really getting to the point. What was the point?Frogs? Great, flying amphibians. Anyhow, don't waste your time. SeeHAPPINESS and SHORT CUTS instead.END"
1,Can I have my money back?,"Great casting, but horrible movie. I thought with such great actors, this movie would be far better than it was. The story line was somewhat dis-jointed, and it was so dark and depressing, I honestly don't know how anybody would want to actually OWN the movie. This film seems to want to be 'Pulp Fiction' with various story lines happenning, but it doesn't come together in such a nice way. It was bizarre, but not in any sort of endearing way. Very bad."
2,Only worth it if someone else pays and you get a free dinner,"On the positive side: 1) Tom Cruise is very good, and if you want proof that he can act this movie is worthwhile. 2) The movie provides an insight into cults such as Landmark Forum and, more importantly, Sterling Institute of Relationships. On the negative side: 2) The movie is bombastic, hammering out its messages without any subtlty. 3) There is no variation in the characters' voices. Every single charcater mouths the exact same obscenities and has the exact same speech patterns. After a while, you realize that you are hearing a chorus of the screenwriter's didactic shouts, with no variation in tone, vocabulary or message. 4) The magic realist ending (the frogs) were a cute devise, but they really pointed to the fact that the screenwriter did not know how to resolve the film."
2,Magnoila is Magcrapia,"After seeing the brilliantly entertaining 'Boogie Nights', what a dissapointing film. Yes it's spectacular, and yes good acting (Cruise a standout), but the film goes nowhere. Characters (who we don't necessarily care about) appear, get hysterical then dissolve into an apparently 'inspired' finale. Don't waste your time."
1,Painful to endure.,"Gosh, this film was bad. It was as if the actors were told to pour out their guts in wrenching circumstances for as long as they could without a script to keep them in line. The result, a long, long exercise in self pity & depression.Was anything good about it? Yes, I did like Jason Robards' & Philip Seymour Hoffman's parts; played honestly without excessive blubbering. The rest of it should be locked and showed only as a penalty for moving violations."
1,Zero stars - a wasteland,"I finally rented this for the weekend and what a BIG disappointment. I dozed off after the first hour and by the 2 1/2 hour point gave up. No interesting people, except the poor little boy who peed his pants at the quiz show. They ranted, they raved, they gazed (meaningfully?)into the camera, they used the *F* word every other sentence, and the STORY? Oh I forgot there wasn't one. If this is supposed to be good film making, I will go back to my collection of old films. Very bad, no matter what the natering nabobs say."
1,I'VE BEEN PELTED BY FROG GUTS,"There seems to be no neutral on this movie. After hearing people I respect rave about it, I gave it a try. I found it to be long and boring, but mostly petentious. Granted, Magnolia has some fine music, some fine performances and a couple cute twists - or maybe they just seemed cute in the blizzard of mind numbing ""over the top"" scenes. The one positive is that if you see it on DVD with a hardened guide, the movie can be condensed into 10 minutes. Then you can watch the documentary stuff, which shows you the criminal waste of film in progress."
2,An extra star for diversity of Opinion,"Magnolia was the worst movie i had seen in years - maybe the worst of all time. I can see how some people with a propensity to overanalyze this film would pull out something meaningful - but sitting thru 3 hours of stultifying dialogue, poor acting and self indulgent sweeping gestures that PT Andersen is making a habit of .. would bore the pants off anyone else."
1,Too Long,"I loved P.T, Anderson's other movies, Hard Eight and Boogie Nights, but this movie was just too long, he tried to tell too many stories in one movie, instead of focusing on one or two main characters. Each story does tie in during the course of the movie, but not physically in a scene. So the movie did not flow well, and I found it really dragged on in partsIf you liked Anderson's other movie don't assume you will like this one, rent it first and decide for yourself."
5,you should really see this movie.,"yes, it's long. yes, it's an ensemble drama about chance.but the one reason (one of the many, but the the most amusing) is that tom cruise is an absolutely ABHORRENT actor.... everywhere else but in this film. the fact is that you must see this film simply to see tom cruise act and act WELL.this is not, and I stress NOT, the only reason to see this film. I was introduced to one of my favourite actors via this movie: William H. Macy, who is amazing in such movies as ""Panic"" and ""Focus."" But I cannot in any words sum up how good this movie is - it's more of an experience than anything, something you just sit through until the end..where it all just hits you and sit back, breathing heavily for a moment, saying ""Wow."" over and over while shaking your head."
3,So ambitious it's destined to fail,"Paul Thomas Anderson's sweeping, biblical film is too epic for its own good. Everything is overdone in Magnolia. Too many characters, too many stories, too much emotion. Every scene is overflowing with emotion, and it becomes exhausting to watch after the first two hours. The film is very self-indulgent, and it could win the award for the most hubristic piece of cinema I've ever seen. That's where it's flawed: one gets the sense that Anderson set out to make the ""ultimate"" movie. It's all in their, every theme you could ever want. It's simply too ambitious a task to pull off. The film also suffers from definite pretentiousness. From the frogs at the end (The Bible! duh), to certain camera angles that are far too show-offy. On the better side, the acting is fabulous. And don't let the three hours running time scare you. It found it to move rather fast."
1,Pretentious Swill,"Rarely have I seen a film so thoroughly awful. Characters, dialogue, and multiple story lines combine to create a symphony of false notes. Some very fine actors are forced to say and do some painfully ridiculous things all under the pretense of creating something ""meaningful"", when in fact the only message here is that student films should never have multi-million dollar budgets. This abomination makes the director's wonderfully under-stated earlier film ""Hard Eight"" look like a four-alarm fluke. Save your money and watch out for the falling frogs. (don't ask)"
1,A self-congratulatory waste of time,"I highly disliked this movie and rather begrudge PT Anderson for making something so bad for me to sit through. The movie is absolutely bursting with ""artistic"" elements, but overall they do more to obscure the main themes than they do to clarify them. Furthermore, there does not there seem to be any reason for them to be in the movie other than the intellectual self-gratification of the movie's creators. I found no sympathy with the main characters, who, for the most part, spent the movie wallowing in self-pity only to have all their problems solved by a contrived and completely nonsensical ending."
3,I'm not sure if I liked it or not.,"To its credit this is an engrossing marvelously directed film that sucks the viewer in and refuses to let go. It is also one of the best cast and acted movies I've ever seen. The performances aren't great in that grand over the top way where everyone says ""What a great performance!"" The perfromaces are great in that you forget that you are watching actors and start to believe that the characters you see are real people.On the downside, the movie never manages to go anywhere, and the stories never converge and are never satisfactorly concluded. And what exactly was the point? Still, this is a must see movie for anyone who really appreciates film, but I wouldn't want to own it or even see it a second time."
5,the frogs will reign,"I was surprised at the lack of appreciation this movie got, and was actually talked out of seeing it. This movie was quite a surprise, and it scared me on a lot of levels. There were so many hidden ironies that watching it multiple times is almost a must. Contrary to what other people have said, Anderson did a fine job of balancing the multitude of actors, and throughout the whole movie- through every scene that, in any other movie, would come off as funny - these scenes were tense. And after going through the entire 3 hours of the movie, the last 5 minutes dont seem nearly as awkward as everyone describes. Fantastic movie."
3,"3 stars too much, 2 too few","Sometimes, it takes a long time to tell a story.It should never have taken over three hours and 15 minutes to tell the stories in Magnolia, compelling as they are.This movie has an amazing cast and is visually rich and engaging. The performances -- even a sleazy character portrayed by Tom Cruise -- can't be topped. Each actor hands in a great turn. There are so many levels to the lives introduced here that for the first two hours, you don't mind the waiting game. It unfolds like the flower that gives the movie its name.However, as the last hour wears on, I became impatient. Forcing moviegoers to sit in witness to artistic vision for this long is simply arrogant, nothing more and nothing less."
5,Incredible,"Rarely does a film take the viewer on an emotional rollercoaster as incredibly stunning as this. This film is three hours of stupendous, top-of-the-line acting from the greatest ensemble of actors in a long long time. P.t. Anderson has put together a mind-blowing journey through a day of the lives of nine people. It exposes everything behind the faces in the media and in the world. It shows dreams and fears of all of us. The beginnings, the ends, the incredible love we posess for each other. No other film in recent history has given such immense care to the explanation of humanity. The DVD edition of this movie takes it another step by including a second disc of all the great extras. This movie is incredible. Period."
2,indulgent melodrama needing some heart,"There's no shortage of superb actors in fascinating situations and all in the hands of director-genius anderson...so why did this movie leave me so bored? Because it feels like melodramatic junkfood -- lots of emotion with little real heart or understanding. We don't really get to know any of the characters or care about them. The viewer is simply transported rocket-speed from one crisis to another, each of which is presented with feverish emotion. There's no silence or insight to enable the viewer to better appreciate the chaos onscreen. At least the tom cruise character is so over-the-top that he's fun to watch. Way too self indulgent for anyone out of high-school. give pt anderson credit for going for a grand slam here (and many feel he got it), but in my opinion he struck out."
1,How could you screw this up,"I watched this movie recently, and was quite disappointed. There was a great story, incredible actors and performances, wonderful photography and production values, but a butchered screenplay and editing job. The movie couldn't decide whether to be a thriller or a farce, and lost on both accounts. Crash got 4 1/2 stars from me, this gets 1 1/2 stars, strictly for the technical work and acting. There is a good reason it was a dud at the box office with the incredible cast it had, folks didn't like it. I wouldn't say don't see it, but expect a disjointed, confused viewing."
2,3 hours of my life that I will NEVER get back,"Look folks, I enjoyed ""Boogie Nights"". Slightly long, but overall a pretty solid, interesting story. I had about average hopes for ""Magnolia"", imagine my suprise when I found even those were to high!There were a lot of great stories here that suffered from the format. If they had cut the character count down even say 25%, this movie would have been a 4 or 5 star movie in my book. Yes, I know, dysfuctional life movies are being done left and right, but there was some really solid stuff here. It just sadly was slaughtered by the constant changing of storylines. As soon as I found myself getting really into someone's story, *SNAP* ""Time to change lines!"" *grumble*Watch it on cable folks, don't buy it, don't rent it, just watch it if you have nothing else to do for 3 hours. Oh, and prepare to be actually angry with the film at the end."
1,horrible pretentious drivel,"It felt like I was in hell for three hours watching this video. I like esoteric filmaking and was lured by the stellar cast and Roger Ebert's thumbs-up, but I have to tell you this was god-awful. There is talent here in the cast (Robards, Cruise, Macy, et al) and the cinematography is excellent but the 'story' and it's 'depth' are sick and stupid. Too much of the f-word also. It put me in a bad mood."
2,"Oh, puhleeeeze","Overhyped, overly long (took me 5 or 6 viewings to even get through it), over-acted, and yes, BORING. The falling frogs does not ""save"" the film, but only highlights what pretentious crap it is. Cruise manages to shine, delivering an energetic and overall excellent performance. Save your time and money though. And be weary of all the great reviews. It seems like they have an ""Emperor's New Clothes"" type of feel. In the future, I will try to avoid movies billed as ""ambitious"". Yuck!"
1,Two words for ya: Weird City,"Maybe I'm just one of the mindless masses. Maybe I'm just not a ""real"" music fan. Maybe I don't read the Bible enough. Maybe my favorite # is 5, so 82 means nothing to me. Maybe frogs just scare the living hell out of me. Maybe the movie theater wasn't ventilated well enough and the 6'6"" bald guy in front of me chewing on his ice, blocking my view for 3 hours made me lose my usual Siskelian like focus while watching this movie.Or maybe......this is just one stupid movie! Are you people out of your MINDS? The only good thing to come out of this movie was the soundtrack--THAT'S where your message is! Stop trying to read into directors' minds--oooh, what was he SAYING in this scene? To enjoy this movie, you needed to be high on drugs. I don't do drugs. Or maybe I should start, since I just didn't freakin get it. This movie made me feel all gooey--like frog glop on a windshield."
3,Soundtrack was distracting...,"...and in certain scenes, it was downright ridiculous.If you liked ""American Beauty"" you might like this movie. Just keep in mind it's over 3 hours long."
3,Powerful and amazing up until the ending,"Magnolia was a very good movie, with an emotional plot that dealt with unrequited love, addiction, feelings of failure, angst and forgiveness. All of its characters had serious issues they were trying their hardest to conceal or get rid of (Claudia,played by Melora Walters, had a serious cocaine addiction and was angry at her father, and Tom Cruise, an actor I can't stand, playing an intriguing role as a chauvinist sex god to hide his feelings of resentment towards his father when he took care of his cancer-ridden mother at the age of 14), and the movie seemed to be heading towards a relevatory ending, but it seriously backfired. Instead of self-discovery, it rained frogs, which killed the movie for me. Still, it was adequate enough to watch for 2/3 of this 3 hour movie."
2,Confused,"I am not unintelligent, but I do not get the frogs. I understand the Biblical reference to Exodus 8:2. I understand that the frogs were one of the ten plagues. But I do not understand what they have to do with this movie. I have read through many of the 4 and 5 star reviews and I saw a lot of people who liked the film and thought it was the wrok of genuis, but no one gave any evidence that they actually understood the frogs. So am I missing something here guys? Ifso help me please! The movie was interesting at parts, and notso interesting in other areas, but it was very long and the ending was very unsatisfying to me."
2,Was Magnolia Based on Short Cuts?,"Does this movie remind anyone else of Robert Altman's Short Cuts? If not, watch it and you'll immediately notice several paralells that seem more than a little suspicious. (For example, Short Cuts is ALSO an extremely LONG film about a large group of disparate, unhappy people who live in California and who all end up connecting somehow, one of whom spends the majority of the movie dying in a hospital bed, and another whom winds up finding his ""long lost"" father, starring Julianne Moore, and featuring a great natural disaster at the end.)"
3,"Long, dark and depressing","Looking at the summary of reviews here on Amazon, it is clear that this is a ""love it or hate it"" movie. I don't fall completely into either of those camps, but I thought the director was trying WAY too hard to be arty, avant-garde and mysterious. There are too many balls in the air, and for the first half of this three-hour movie the plot lines seem totally unrelated. Tom Cruise is wonderful as the smarmy ""seduce and destroy"" seminar leader, until the deathbed scene near the end, when he goes right over the top, wailing and flailing.The two main problems with Magnolia, as I see it, are that almost none of the characters are very likable, and the production is very dark. Many of the scenes are shot at night or in dark rooms, and the result is a cold, dark feel. Coupled with the sad, screwed-up lives of most of the protagonists, this makes for a depressing film."
2,Disappointing...,"I was really surprised to see that I am one of the few people who did not like this movie. Although the actors did a very good job I think that ""Magnolia"" is way to long and hence gets pretty boring after a while. The story isn't very special either and the whole plot is way too dramatic at times even ridiculous. After watching Magnolia I felt that I just wasted 3 hours of my life..."
5,"Tom Cruise Was Robbed, I'm Feelin' a little Froggy","Possibly the best character movie since ""Short Cuts,"" this film is more off the wall and a whole lot of strange. The multi stories are all interesting. My favorite ivolves Tom Cruise. He was robbed from his oscar. His performance was so antistereotype of his persona and was so brilliantly acted. His scenes were breathtaking at times. John C. Reilly also did a superior job, but these men aren't alone. All the cast was super and you care about the characters. At the end of the movie you really get to know them and feel almost that you might have made a friend or two. Look out for the raining frogs. That part was simply great. One of the best movies that was not nominated for best picture."
4,Brutality!,"Killer album: shredding riffs, pounding drums, the works! There is only one guitarist on this album, and the overall sound is rather linear. Nevertheless, one you pop the disc in your player, you are hooked! GET IT! Check out Embodiment of Chaos.....awesome intro!"
2,Odd Fit,The shoe seems true to size but just felt weird. The front part was not as long as it looks in the picture. The color of the pewter looked very dark and cheap.
2,Has a few merits,"Although this book is compact it is too heavy to carry if one is on a walking tour. I can read a newspaper without glasses, but with glasses I had trouble with the type. It is not in an orderly format nor is there is a good section on hotels."
5,Eyewitness Travel Guide to France,Very good book for the ones who want to get to know in details this wonderful country which has been active part of the contemporany history of our world.It gives you information from the wolrdly famous French wineyards to tips about travelling in to the Romanish sites spread over around the country.Its write style is very accesible to everyone who wants to start travel books reading and deep explore the frontiers around the globe.
4,The Angel of Galilea es una dulce compañía,"The Angel of Galilea se llama, en español, Dulce Compañía. Es una novela irreverente, juguetona, esperanzadora. El amor de la reportera por el ángel, más terrestre que otra cosa, más colombiano que étereo, es una delicada metáfora de la forma cómo la gente de Colombia se relaciona con su cruda realidad. Vale la pena leerlo!"
4,Thought provoking,"Dulce Compañía seems to work around the theme of whether or not the angel is really an angel, and yet it is not ultimately important to define precisely his identity. You can be dead set against ""angel culture"" and still get a lot out of this book. There are many strong Biblical references tied in with non-Biblical references in a manner that makes the read very interesting. Bluring the lines between reality and truth is a typical method used by Latin American writers that will make you question your need to find scientific explanations to what life brings. It puts the mystery and intrigue back into daily city life, a refreshing change to the reader who learns to take what comes with an open mind, let themselves go, and abandon themselves to ""foolish"" beliefs."
3,Strange,I really wanted to enjoy this novel more than I did. But the truth is. It wasnt very good. Skip this one and keep looking.
4,For all those dusty Avalon Hill games on your shelf...,"That you bought and never got to play because none of your friends could understand why it would be fun to spend 20-30 hours refighting the breakout from St. Lo. TOAW brings back the strategy of turn-based games as opposed to whack-a-mole stuff like C&C.Not for everyone; as Steven Wright said, ""One mile equals one mile"" when you play this game. Defend the Korean peninsula and you'll feel like you spent three years playing the scenario. But if you remember those Avalon Hill wargames, this is definitely for you."
3,There is really no strategy involved,"This game offer a tremendous amount of options on how to play the game, but offers very little overall strategy. There is really no way off truely developing an effective strategy. Units that provide artilery are basically non-effective. Air units seem to get crushed by other air units of equal strenght. Lacks any pre-battle set-up options. Does offer some interesting battles, and plenty of information. A little hard to truely understand. Would be better if there was a tuitorial installed."
3,"Worked well, for ONE year","My mother and grandmother both have working mixers for over 15 years. That's what I expected from Delongi as well. However, it seems like this mixer was designed to last just as long as it is under warranty: ONE year! After one year of normal use (one cake, one bread a week) the mixer started groaning. A couple of months later smoke came out and the motor burnt. Fixing it would cost like buying a new one, so I went and bought a Kitchen Aid at William-Sonoma. They give a life time warranty!"
5,Kids will love this cow stuffed animal!,This stuffed animal was a great purchase for my 2 year old. Bessie the cow is very durable in the washing machine and my son loves her!
3,yankee dog hat,"nice design however it really doesnt stay on my pooch. He htes wearing it, but then again dogs are not designed to wear hats. He looked cute in it though."
1,Expensive!,I bought this rice (for $9.98)expecting to receive 10 5oz bags for the price. The same thing in most stores cost $1.50 max.Luckily Amazon gave me a full refund (even though you are not allowed to return food).I would not buy this product via Amazon again. I'll just get it from my local story for 1/8 the price. a couple weeks after I bought this product the company lowered the price by 50%! Ha!
5,20+ years of loving this rice!,"I can remember making this yellow rice for a ethnic food tasting party back in elementary school. I always loved the vibrant colour and flavor. Since moving to a small town, I was unable to find this rice at the local food store. Giving thanks for it being sold on Amazon.com. I highly recommend this rice to anyone who wants a easy, less expensive way to make saffron yellow rice. I just put the contents in the rice cooker, with 1 2/3 cups of water, and a little olive oil and wa~la... a lovely dish that goes great with either a veggie stir-fry, local grass fed beef, free range chicken, or by itself. I ordered 30 bags. Super fast delivery, and now I am stocked-- for a little while. :) Blessings~"
4,More Mellow Tech-House Sounds from Saavas,"To those fans of straight-up four-to-the-floor tech-house music, this album won't disappoint. I found this CD to be more background music to wash dishes and wiggle your bum to than peak-hour booty-shaking dance music, but that's exactly what I was hoping it to be.SELECT does seem to have more of a funk to it than some of his earlier releases (Hi-Rise, or his Cooler release under his Sound Track alias), even hearkening back to early-to-mid 90s house sound with his use of a stuttering snare drum. Some tracks could easily find themselves on the Basic Channel/Chain Reaction label as well.Those of you who like your tech-house clean and mellow, ala Theorem or Maurizio, you will not be disappointed."
2,Kids will likely love it; parents will tolerate it thru clenched teeth...,"My 7 yo daughter BEGGED for this toy for her birthday at the beginning of August. We gave in despite reservations about something that sticks to the door. So far it has worked fine. In case of emergency, the sticky tape has velcro on it which is a big help because my daughter keeps changing then forgetting the code. The technology is kind of cool - as the light in the eyepiece cycles between red, green and yellow it recognizes the color you blink on. However, if you don't press your eye socket firmly on the eyepiece or don't exaggerate your blink, it sounds an OBNOXIOUS alarm and yells, ""intruder!"". My daughter loves it; I'm just hoping the novelty wears off soon..."
2,Great at first,"We got this for my 8 yr old daughter for Christmas, she loved it. However within about a month it stopped working. I contacted the vendor but did not receive a response. I would like to order her another one or something similar but they are all out of stock."
4,Privacy at a blink of an eye.,"The age of KEEP OUT - BOYS ONLY or GIRLS ONLY signs on yourchild's bedroom door comes into the realm high tech with thisnifty access control device.With a simple blink of her eye, your daughter can maintain herprivacy while still allowing her parents access upon demandto her private domain.Sure to be a hit with the kids, this spy-like gadget issomething I wish they had when I was a kid."
4,why isnt it in stores anymore?,"i once bought this thing in the store and it worked perfectly.. except for the time it fell off of my door and we had to screw it to my door so no one could get in. and there are two reasons why i think it should be sold in stores again. one is that you can check its condition before buying it and not have to worry about it. and the second thing is that you wont have to wait for so long. i really think this should be in stores again instead of just online, since it was in stores before. and thats the only reason why i rated it 4 instead of 5"
4,okay,this toy is okay but my brother knows how to figure out my password amd it was very hard to figure out how to set the password.also it is very lOUD and it bairly fits on my door! it also doesn't really work because my door doesn't shut right!
3,12 year old,This is a cool toy it even tells you if you had any intruders and how many.You have to put your eye on ther piece and blink your code right on.
4,good in the beginning,"I had wanted this toy sooo badly for christmas. I loved it for the first couple of weeks until the tape started coming off and now if I put it on my door, it just falls off in a couple of minutes. They should have made the tape more duarble. Now the toy just sits in my room and im back to having my brothers in my room again! This is ok a first but then the tape just wears out."
3,Okay,"This toy actually works although there are two problems, 1.sometimes a fly triggers the alarm and it won't be quiet2. The double stick tape doesn't work, so it keeps falling"
2,Don't Buy this!!!!,"I got this toy for Christmas, and it is cheap, it dosen't work like it said it would, it is so much bigger and gets in the way. I put it on my door and when i tried to take it off,and it pealed the paint off with it!!!!!So, WARNING don't buy this toy!!"
5,door locker,i think this toy isvery well done i thinkit has a great colour on the baseand it looks great funfor my rating i would have to give about out of 100 99 out of hundred that is how important this toy is to me that is y i really want it for christmas YER GO EYE-LOCK ELECTRONIC DOOR LOCKROOM GUARD
3,even Lana can't save this one,"MR. IMPERIUM is, not surprisingly, one of the lesser titles in Lana Turner's resume. Not even her beauty and charm can save this lumbering turkey of a musical.Turner plays Fredda Barlo, an American cabaret star who becomes romanced by a down-to-earth member of European royalty--known simply as Mr. Imperium (and played by talented opera basso Ezio Pinza). Featured in thankless supporting roles are Debbie Reynolds and Marjorie Main.Fans of musicals are likely to enjoy it (despite a song about ""presto anti-pasto""--what the...?). There's a reason why this movie is now in Public Domain."
1,not as advertised,first this movie is not in color. second there is initials in the lower right hand corner of the film that is very distracting. third the sound is terrible. i saw this movie on tv and it was in color. so dont buy this.
3,Wasn't As Bad As I Thought,"I bought this movie because I'm a fan of Debbie Reynolds, and she has a small part in it. I was also a fan of Lana Turner. I think the movie was okay because those two actresses had a good performance. It doesn't matter that the storyline was quirky or unbelievable, or that the singing wasn't sounding great, the movie as a whole can be enjoyed by watching the glamorous Lana Turner and cute Debbie Reynolds. The leading man was the only turnoff. Lana supposedly couldn't stand him when filming the movie, but it didn't show in the film. But he wasn't that handsome, he doesn't deserve Lana Turner."
2,A pleasant enough piece of fluff.,"I read some of this book and, while it generates the occasional chortle (or guffaw), it simply didn't have ""staying power."" Another similar book, ""Idiot Letters,"" by Paul Rosa, proved to contain far superior, funnier material at a much more reasonable price. Folks, go with Mr. Rosa's work and you shan't be sorry!"
2,not as good as Laslo Letters,"OK for a short while. Not near as good as the Laslo Letters. They make a big deal about the fact that the correspondence represents in its letters the life of the family. This is weak at best, and more often forced. Neat idea but not executed on very well in my opinion. Try something else."
4,"Love, Love, Love the way this smells","If I could rate this cologne just by its wonderful and distinctive scent, I'd give it a 5 in a heartbeat. Sadly, it's always been a bit more costly than I care for and the scent fades rather fast. So you'll blow through a bottle pretty quickly. That being said, this is still one of the best smelling colognes you will find."
4,"pleasant, not overpowering","I first purchased happy for men in 1999, mainly because it was new and not main stream like cool water, ck1, yada yada yada.. It's quite intriguing, pleasant with citrus tones, and if you accidentally put too much on, it's not terribly overpowering. I highly recommend this to any guy who is looking for a unique scent that stands out above other over-used brands cologne sprays. It is in the 50-70 dollar range, which I find to be the only downside."
5,Excellent scent! I love it.,I am buying another bottle as this scent is definitely something I particularly love. I can wear it everyday and it can be worn when going to the zoo or even at a business meeting.
1,Stale or fake product,"This supposed Clinique Happy is likely either completely fake or super old batch that it barely even reminds of the real thing. Amazon doesn't state that this is in import and there is no way to return the product.BUYER BEWARE, save yourself the trouble and your money and go buy it somewhere local instead.We got used to the convenience and started buying more things from amazon then local stores so it's a shame that amazon is becoming as unreliable as ebay these days."
5,All's Fair In Love and War/Can't lay it down,Michael J's book is spellbinding. With each adventure you want to know what is going to happen next. I read it in one sitting and later read it again. It is insiteful to the teenage years and the love life of our high school years. Anxiously awaiting the next book out. Enjoyed/enjoyed/enjoyed.
5,2004 Olympic Cap,"I've loved the look of this cap from the moment I saw our athletes wearing it on TV during the games, but resisted buying. What was I waiting for? It fits great and I look 15 pounds lighter...okay, it fits anyway! Thank you for this cap which arrived in a timely manner."
4,Great Primer for those new to e communication,"I purchased the books for use by my team and they enjoyed using the books to improve the impact of their messages. We communicate daily via email and at times it is the only way we can communicate so as you can imagine, our email has to be precise and informative. I highly recommend this book for those new to e communicating or for those of us who never really knew there were rules... Also a big bonus is there is a section on grammar and how to communicate effectively while maintaing good grammar!"
2,This is an old book.,"This book was written in 1994. With so much change in the past years, it seems unlikely that it is still relevant. If I had known the publication date (or paid attention to it), I would not have purchased it."
5,Amish cook book,great little cookbook. In great shape. Fast ship and loved the emails to keep me informed of order status.
5,For the professional or fanatic amateur,"Very thorough, especially with idioms.So far I've only come across one French ""word"" that I found in the Grand Robert but not in here: ""véronal"". And to call that a word is something like calling ""kleenex"" in English a word.It costs something, but if you're serious, it will be well worth it: it will save you lots of time."
1,"Shallow, empty not fulfilling.","I was not able to actually read this book, although it came highly recommended by local educators and school officials. Amazon will not permit me to order this item because I have been assigned (unknown my me) another account # thus preventing me from completing my order (This, despite my previous 4 orders). The help # given to resolve these issues requires a 20 min wait. This is the kind of customer service treatment I thought was reserved only for customers of AOL."
1,I would have given 0 star if I had the choice.,"This stupid CD doesn't work. It's a trial version. You have to register with Skyscape to unlock it. But the registration is a painful and unsuccessful process even if you have the time. Bottom line, don't buy it, period."
5,have a bottle of scotch on hand when you read this,I love this book... A bucket of ice and a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black and this book is really all I would need on a deserted island.
3,Dark but highly entertaining vision of corporatist dystopia,"It has been said that this book is the Cyberpunk precursor, the great granddaddy that started off this school of sci-fi writing. It is certainly a good, crisp read, highly-entertaining to boot and chok-a-blok with high-tech gizmos (the gadget-freak would be delighted!). Story is told from the perspective of a paranoic but highly-skilled corporate assasin which the author somehow endears the reader to, notwithstanding the repugnant nature of the character's vocation. Mick's vision of future corporatist America dystopia has the eerie feel of plausible authenticity, and his grasp of action and dramatic-tension is unfailing. Every chapter reveals a new grand vista of adventure and action. Not his best, but certainly one of his better, works. Perfect for that long train or greyhound trip.Visit Mick's webpagehttp://www.thanatosoft.freeserve.co.uk/"
2,Feel-Good Formula Movie,"It's clear that this movie isn't going to win any awards, but if you want a simple formula movie, Strictly Business is good way to spend an hour and a half. I read Leonard Maltin's review and its strikes me as funny that he would even mention anything having to do with money or how easy it is to make. Did anyone question the reality of Richard Gere marrying a street prostitute in Pretty Woman? Or how easy it was for Forrest Gump to turn his simple boating enterprise into an empire with holdings in Apple? Let's be careful about how and why we evalute the ""realism"" in movies. Strictly Business is a mildly entertaining, 2-star movie, that is as realistic and complex as a 2-star movie can be."
5,Old school classic,I've been waiting for this to become available on DVD. It's special to me because it's one of the movies that my sister & I love.
2,PERIOD PIECE,Yeah Strictly Business is a period piece. A lot of these types of movies with young black stars were being made then. Of course it's not a GREAT movie. Was it meant to be? I recall going to see it at the movies with some of my boys. It was very enjoyable at the time and very fun. Halle was a relative newcomer then and we all thought she was fly. Just a fun feel good movie.
3,Good,This is a good book despite the fact that I dont like Literature. But some things are a little hard to understand or visualize.
1,gooses review,I had a class where I had to use this book and I only got a B in the class thanks to this book. This book should be strictly kept in libraries for its lack of educational value. On the bright side the best thing about this book has to be the cover. I didn't read the whole book but as far as I can tell it dosent have anything to do with the content inside the book.
5,BUY THIS INSTEAD OF THE NEW ADDIATION,"Same exact book as the newest addition of the book. THe page numbers are slightly different, but if it is for a class, it will have all the same stories you need, almost all of it the same."
5,a great book for learning literature,My professor told me to purchase this book for his course in English Composition. It was written in a very clear way.
2,Satisfied,"I bought the book back in August and it was shipped within about a week or a couple days less that a week. The book was in good condition for the price, and the service was fast and good."
5,Super Comfortable,The socks are very comfortable to wear with shoes or without. A better buy than most other brands I've bought.
5,One of my all-time favorites,This is a wonderful CD. Maddy's voice is better than ever and the quality of material is extraordinarily high. The arrangements are brilliant. I cannot recommend this CD highly enough. It's for anyone who loves great singing and songwriting.
4,Distinctive and powerful vocals,"Maddy was featured on ""Incantations"" by Mike Oldfield. This is modern Celtic music, and is done very well. Maddy has a powerful voice, and her songs are very nice. This album lacks a certain fire, however, and as a result is a little slow in places."
2,deceiving video,"There is only a few felix cartoons and a bunch of other cartoons that arent felix cartoons. That is why they entitled it and friends, because there are other toon episodes not because they are all felix episodes with his friends in them. Which is what i thought. Be aware of what u are buying. Its deceiving but over all it is in spanish and the reason why I bought it."
5,So good - I re-read it,"Just wanted to say - on vacation, I decided to re-read Terri's book. And may I change my review to a ""5""?"
3,A good starting point but...,"This book has a lot of info for someone who wants to start in this biz. I liked her input on what to include/exclude on your demo tape. However, some of the expert advice is ""take classes"" and ""find an agent"" - duh! She also doesn't seem to know much about the nuts & bolts of recording, for example: ""take your headphones off if you're making comments about the producer or engineer, they pick up everything."" Um, Terry the *microphone* picks up everything regardless of where your headphones are."
2,Where was the editor?,"The book contains good information, but it is so poorly written and edited that it is, at times, incoherent. I could not get past the first thirty pages."
2,Frustrating Read and Repetitive,"There are so many typos in this book that it is actually frustrating to read. There is also so much repetition, not in general, but huge paragraphs that can be found word for word three pages earlier. Terri Apple is very good at cheerleading and she obviously knows the business but there's too much emphasis on LA contacts and way, way, way too many text errors to recommend this book. And I'm not talking about grammar. I'm talking about ""The re"" ""and and"" or whole words left out. I found myself struggling to read this book. Since it was published in 1999 some of the advice is out-of-date, like carry a pager (pre-cell phones) which is not Ms. Apple's fault, nor her editors, if she had one. I do find her responsible for the content of her book. With so many books on voice-overs out there, I would recommend another."
4,For Pro's or beginners,"I read Terri's book with great anticipation. I wanted to see how much she knew; how much I did or didn't know and what she could add to my knowledge. Terri Apple does a fine job of jogging some very well founded reminders to those of us who are professionally making a living from VO work. AND - from the prospective of a beginner, she also spells it out without painting any rainbows. It's being told ""as it is.""This is a very helpful publication to those of us to need to sharpen our skills and continue learning to hon our skills and a wonderful insightful glimpse into the workings of the world of voiceovers.I recommend this book to Pro's & Newbies."
2,Not exactly what I expected,"Personally I expected more helpful hints and techniques for improving your skills in voice-overs but instead most of the book is concentrated on advising how to promote your talent. So if you want to know how to be a voice-talent this is propably not the best book for you, but if you feel you already have what it takes to be a voice-over artist, it gives you advise what to do to get yourself into business."
2,Disappointed,"This is a great brush, and I liked the shape and the handle. However, it broke pretty easily. The handle snapped off where it meets the brush :("
2,Just a fancy reprint of the NDK Documentation,"I was excited when I first saw this book, the content that it promised and the fact that it was released by Novell Press made it a safe buy. I was wrong! The book doesnt cover anything new that cant be found in the NDK documentation. It even uses Novells code samples. It references code on the CD that is non-existent, a common occurence now-a-days. The author obviously did not do any research or hands on work with this book. Do not buy this book, read the NDK documentation and you will be ahead of the game in NDS development."
2,A mere taste from the banquet,"This book provides a little taste of all things NDS. It has alittle bit of information on NDS programming in C, Java, ActiveX, andsome scripting. This information is enough to get you started tinkering, but it is inadequate for serious development.This book does provide a good introduction to NDS programming, and is a springboard to bigger and better things. But if you already know the basics of NDS programming, you do not need this book..."
5,More Operatic Metal,"Thanks to comments on previous reviews I was pointed toward this group.The music is excellent. More importantly, the recording quality of this CD and of the SECRET OF THE RUNES CD which I ordered at the same time is superlative relative to other CDs.The order from Amazon came very quickly."
5,and now for something completely different,"Totally, completely differnt. Well worth the investment if you like .. different. I've been looking lately for new stuff - most of the new bands are completely forgettable, Therion isn't. The opera stuff gets a bit much at times, but I really enjoyed it."
3,Over rated but Good,"Most outsiders don't understand why this album is so praised. It was the first big album by therion. The first one that got them popular, and the first one to experiment heavily with opera and classical arrangements.The music and recording itself was done rather early in the bands career and is rough around the edges so to speak. If you are a person that only listens to mainstream bands you may have a hard time liking this. On the other hand most of the album is pretty enjoyable and interesting just for the fact that it is something different.If you are a first time Therion listener, I would suggest buying a more recent album first."
5,Breaking Free from Emotional Eating,"I love this book. It was easy to read. If you have any issues with emotional eating, this is the book for you. I could really relate to the book."
5,Amazing Amazon,"I ordered, I paid, I received items, I'm pleased with the process! The Geneen Roth books that I ordered are exactly what I wanted and they arrived exactly as Amazon said they would! Thanks to the seller and to the whole process...5 stars!!! :)"
1,Not exactly a review but a commentary for the publisher on the Kindle version,"Please note, the paperback version of the book is a LOWER price than the Kindle version. This should never be true, NEVER."
4,On the path,"I just finished ""Breaking Free from Emotional Eating"", and felt that I got a great deal out of it. I had already read ""Women Food and God"" which I also liked and would recommend after this book. I would say that if you are just beginning with your weight path, Breaking Free may be the best place to start because it gives you exercises of thoughts about your eating and things in your life. I decided to NEVER DIET AGAIN about 2 months ago thanks to her books, and I really feel better about myself and am loosing weight and learning to love myself. Yes, there are days that I still eat mindlessly, but after I do it, I become aware of it and that is a good step. Good luck to all of us out there struggling with eating and weight issues, Geneen Roth's books are worth the read!!"
4,great read for those with food issues,"I wasn't too sure what to expect, but this book offers some useful tips and activities for those dealing with food issues. I've had issues food for most of my life, and this book has helped to delve into the unconscious issues behind my relationship with food. Although I do not agree with the authors 'eat whatever you want, when you want it' mantra; I feel that she suggests trying this in order to zap the power that we give to some forbidden foods."
2,Good and Bad,"I learned about the non-diet approach from Jane Hirshmann and Carol Munter's book, Overcoming Overeating (or OO). What I love about OO is that they understand how important self acceptance and size acceptance are to REALLY letting go of emotional eating. As long as there is a voice within saying, I'm only good enough if I'm thin enough, the world is an unsafe place to live. And those of us who use food to soothe anxiety, will turn to food to soothe that unsafe feeling.Geneen's books always seem to hold that other viewpoint - that thin is better. It's often veiled our couched in terms of acceptance (which, to me, makes it a little creepy). If you want to learn about your compulsion to eat to soothe your feelings, then stick with Overcoming Overeating, or the sequel, When Women Stop Hating their Bodies."
2,Use your time elsewhere,"This book was only okay. I got bored with it part way through, but read the whole thing. At the end I was thinking, well that was kind of a waste of my time."
3,Breaking Free from Emotional Eating,"The author has an effective way to help those who are in difficulty with eatingand dealing with emotional problems. I gave the book to someone with this need.Emotions are in mostly all we do, not unlike decisions made about other issues. THINK BEFORE WE ACT! Helps me."
3,Breaking Free from Emotional Eating,A little hard to follow at times but there were some good tips to help with this problem.
4,Great book,"I really got a lot out of this book. It is a great tool for anyone who has been on diet. I have had a life long struggle wait and this is sure a better choice. She give positive steps and gets at the ""heart"" of emotional eating. This is a book one could read over and over. Each time one read it they would get some new incite into their eating."
2,Not for everyone,"This book had a few new ideas, but overall I found it not very helpful. I tried her suggestion of eating what you want, and found that I was not eating a very balanced diet. Maybe some people naturally gravitate toward a proper diet, but I am not one of them. She basically says over and over if this isn't working for you it is because YOU aren't doing it right, not because this method may not be for everyone. This book might work for you, but don't count on it."
3,Mixed feelings,"Ms. Roth has some interesting ideas about the subject of emotional over-eatting. I am currently in a medical fasting program which has tenets opposite of Ms. Roth. IE, we eat before we get hungry and we do not allow ouseelves what we want whether in front of our mothers or not. Also, Ms. Roth claims to have climbed to a vast poundage of 155. That ia about the amount I had to lose. So I find her relevance to be a little thin."
2,Yuck!,I didn't like this book. Not my style. More about her than anything else. I need good advice. This wasn't it.
2,"Too much ego, not enough help",Not really helpful; certainly not worth the price! I would not recommend it to anyone truly needing help. All she does is talk about herself and her friends' experiences.
4,Accurate,After giving up on step counting because the pedometers I had were not accurate my sweetie got me this one. After 4 months of usage this is one of the most accurate step counters I have ever encountered. The only time I have had any problems is in winter with my big coat on - if I wear on hip the bulk of the coat short-counts.NOTE this does not have a clock like many others
1,Timex Pedometer,"First of all this is a cheaper (somewhere around $12) than the one pictured. The one shipped to me was a Timex, blue plastic from Pro Sport Watches.As a matter of fact, the belt clip (cheap plastic) broke off yesterday. Is there any way I can get reimbursed?"
5,A diary of signs and wonders,"I am still reading this book, but it has been amazing so far. The life she lived for God is insiping. I read it as I am there with her. As i can see God moving in His people. AAA++++"
2,Not great,"I bought two of these. They were both cut, which created a hard line that made my painting project difficult. Not a good, soft sponge that's nicely full of holes to create a good, natural look. I suggest you keep looking and don't buy this."
4,Size varies with color,"I love Gloria Vanderbilt Amanda jeans - I wear a size 6 in the blue denim colors. But the black color is cut bigger for some reason (perhaps because it's made in a different country?) I discovered this after buying 2 different pairs of black size 6 jeans that did not fit (I thought the first one was a fluke). I found a local store that carries size 4 in black, and they fit OK. I asked the store attendant if they had received other comments about different colors being sized differently, and she said ""yes"". I also discovered that a friend in a different part of the U.S. had the same problem with different sizing on different colors of jeans. This certainly isn't a problem with Amazon - they are great! It's a problem with Gloria Vanderbilt jeans. However, they fit so nicely (and truly are ""slimming"" as the label claims) that it is worth learning which sizes you wear in which colors."
4,Country of Origin important for Fit,"Had a problem with the sizing. It seems to matter where they're made. The jeans that are made in Sri Lanka fit better than the ones made in Egypt or Pakistan and Malaysia. The ones from China have VERY short pockets and the material is inferior. The material is identical to the other ones, but definitely different after washing. The material is a little ""rougher"". Perhaps a poorer grade of cotton.I have to be more diligent and read the label before purchase, as I still like the jeans.It seems now though, it's hit or miss.Terry Mare"
3,Quality Assurance - Where is it?,"I agree with other reviewers who's main complaint is lack of consistency. I've purchased MANY pairs of Amanda jeans & capris, and have noticed extreme variances in fit and some in construction from one to the next. Some earn a 2, others a 5-star. Sheesh. Never occurred to me to start checking country of manufacture! (Ha, have apparently been spoiled by companies with better QA teama.) I've had ""talls"" shorter than the next pants' average, and baggy-butts & waistbands about 50% of the time. Waaaa... when they come through correctly, they're wonderful though."
4,Great Jeans,"I love these, I hope Gloria Vanderbilt continues to make this style, I'm 5'2"" and find that petites are too short, regulars are too long.. but these are the correct length."
1,Pockets are way too small!!!,"Pockets are way too shallow(small). I do not use a purse and my wallet keeps falling out of the pocket. Jeans fit great, but pockets are horrible. Are they trying to save money on material?"
2,GV Amanda Stretch Jeans,"Bought 2 pair, same size, different colors (one classic one rinse). The classic fit just as they should, the rinse felt at least 2 sizes smaller...made in India. GV needs better standardization of their sizes from country to country. This is not the first time I have had this problem with them, but the first time on Amazon!"
3,Fabric NOT as advertised,"I love the Amanda stretch jeans! The jeans I just received were NOT the product as advertised on this page. Instead of ""77% cotton, 22% polyester, 1% spandex"" the jeans I received were 99% cotton, 1% spandex.Not as pliable, and watch for shrinkage. But I'll keep them as the fit, tho tighter than I like, is still good-looking."
3,Sizes vary too much,"Gloria Vanderbilt jeans are wonderful, but the sizes vary way too much. I have decided that the only way to buy these jeans is in a place where you can try them on. Two pairs, marked the same size, can be vastly different. Once you get the right size, however, they are comfortable and attractive."
1,Vanderbilt would be horrfied to see her name on these jeans,"Seller office was polite and courteous. I hope to receive a return shipping label, as the pants were of inferior quality. One of the two pairs ordered was so flimsy it fit inside the bottom of an envelope. Stitching and seams would come apart likely after a short period of time. No rollover seaming. Cloth used was very very very thin. How does one know what jeans ordered online will be like> Are these knockoffs of brand name jeans or are all G Vanderbilt jeans this poorly made these days?"
3,"Tooo short for the 5""11 person BUT","I love these jeans, and have several pairs that are very loose, trying to find a smaller size, with no luck in the length..I have been told that they dont make them... I need a 14 T Please I will buy one in many colors if you can get them 36 inches long!!!! Looking for answers here..thanks so much."
2,Inconsistent,"I hate trying on jeans at the store and was happy to find GV Amanda jeans, size 8, seemed to fit very well. Experience now shows the fit is very inconsistent from pair to pair. My most recent purchase is extremely baggy around the waist, although they seem ok through the hips. They are also longer than other Amanda jeans I ownIt's unfortunate GV doesn't have better quality control to assure consistent fit so shoppers could shop online without worry about fit."
3,diasapointment,I purchased your Amanda jeans a few years ago and I loved them. They were a perfect fit. I had put on some weigh around my waist. I bought the next size at Kohl's which seem to fit perfect. When I got them home I realized I had bout a short length and with shoes on they just came to my ankles. I returned them and bought two pairs in a size 12 regular. They're too big in the leg and the waist is too big that they keep sliding down. I've tried numerous times to shrink them but without any luck. I find that their sizes are deceiving. If I buy them again I'll be sure to try them on.
3,Tiny pockets won't hold cell phone,"Tiny, tiny front pockets! These jeans are a wonderful fit in every way EXCEPT that the depth of the front pockets is so shallow that my small cell phone won't safely stay in place. A folded tissue is about the only thing I can keep in either of these front pockets. Groan! In this world where everyone carries a cell phone, these pockets prevent me from giving a 5-star rating to these Amanda Classic Fit Tapered Jeans that I love in every other way. The jeans sit right below the waist, which makes stooping over easy because underwear doesn't show. They fit and wear well. Please, Gloria V, add some depth to the front pockets!"
1,This is for a child.,The description says that the length of this bracelet is 7 inches when in reality it is barely 6. That extra inch makes a huge difference as the bracelet will not fit an adult or even a teenager. Save your money and look elsewhere.
4,beautiful!,"my husband got it for me, its really nice, only problem is the clasp is a little hard to do your self...but its really a nice bracelet!"
1,Buyer Beware!,"My daughter asked Santa for this toy for Christmas this year 2002. Santa brought it. The box looked promising. We hooked it up to the Television, following the instructions to a T. The Video was in Black and White. The box shows the video in color. The dance mat has four seperately colored dance flowers. The music works. But the Video Picture was B&W. We thought we had hooked it up wrong, we then hooked it up to the VCR and then back to the T.V. Not a success. We went on the computer to Radica.com that is listed on the packaging. Barbies Dance Party is not listed anywhere. I then went to Barbie.com and its no even listed there. I then took the time to puruse through the Internet Search Engine to see if there were any articles and the like on this subject. I then went to the Toy R Us site and noticed that this product was discontinued. There seems to be more to this story than meets the eye."
1,Very Disappointing,"My 4 year old received this as a gift this Christmas. She was very excited to start playing with it. It did show up in color, but the picture quality was terrible. The flowers you step on to dance don't always register that she has stepped on them and she had to stomp hard. The timing of the dances is awful and it bores her quickly. It runs on batteries and after turning it on the second time the button wouldn't turn off so it just wore the batteries down.She probably won't play with it again. It has sat in the corner since Christmas day. Don't waste your money."
1,Worst toy ever,"My 12 year old son saved up his allowance for over a month to buy a great Birthday present for his 4 year old sister. He thought the Barbie Dance party game would be neat since she always tries to play the older kid&#65533;s X-box. This seemed like a good alternative to a video game. My daughter was so exited when she opened it and wanted to play with it right away. My husband had to monkey around with it for 10 minutes just to get a color picture, which was terrible anyway. She had to stomp on the flowers and she was bored with it in 10 minutes. My son was so disappointed that he had wasted all that money on a useless game. We ended up returning it and he got her a huge craft set that she loves. This was such a pain in the neck, I would have rated it 0 if I had the option."
2,"Very poor product, buyer beware!!!","My daughter really wanted this item so we purchased it and 15min after she started using it the screen went to black and white. We replaced the batteries, poof!! it was color again. It looks as though this item should not be battery powered. Very cheap poor quality item. I can't beleive this was the hot Chritmas item! I know there are a lot of dissapointed purchasers out there. Buyer be afraid...be very afraid."
1,Not worth the money,"This was a present for my six year old sister. She screamed with delight at the sight of the box on Christmas morning! The box looked exciting. When my parents installed it, the picture came up in black and white. The box shows it in colour. My sister was disapointed, but she just wanted to play the game. I chose the first difficulty level just in case the others were too hard. The game itself is very boring. There are four coloured flowers on the mat, all you have to do is stand on them. Sophie (my sister) tried the first three levels and beat them all easily. But the fourth level was so fast that she could hardly keep up with the lights. She cried, 'Abby, you try!' . Now I am normally quite good at dancing games, having owning a dance mat myself, but I couldn't beat the last level. This game is a total waste of time."
1,Not worth your money!,"I just purcased this item for my 5 year old, first off, the instructions were misssing (this is typical of Toys R Us, it seems when they receive a return they don't check the merchandise and just place it back on the shelf))I plugged it in, and all it said was ""Lets Dance"" and that was it!!!!!"
2,save your money,"Sounded like a fun gift for my barbie enthusiast granddaughter, and she was excited about it at first but that lasted maybe 10 minutes at the most, and I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't ever want to play with it again. All it does is tell you to step on four different colored flowers and plays a dance beat. Not very exciting! And definitely not worth [money]."
5,"fantastic, even for the unncordinated!","i'm really impressed with this video. i'm a horrible dancer, and every video to teach dancing that i've tried has made me cry with shame. in the extras, there's a section where she breaks down every single move in the dance routine. she breaks down every single movement and goes pretty slowly (plus, there's rewind). i haven't worked up to incorporating everything into the 30 and 60 minute dance routines yet, but i'm just excited i can actually learn a move at a time! that's more than i've ever accomplished before. also, she's fun to learn from. she has a contagious smile/mood and encourages you to enjoy yourself instead of worrying about getting everything exactly right. that's nice :)"
2,Dance? maybe but not going to get your heart pumping/,"I'm a pretty athletic person and I bought this when looking for a way to ease back into working out after having a baby. I'm not the most coordinated person in the world, but I found I had to keep rewinding to get some of the moves. Also, there is not really a fitness aspect to this as my heart never even really started pumping. Mind you, I've never watched it all the way through as I found it boring and not really my thing at all. This has been retired to the back of the pile of Dvds."
1,I wish I hadn't bought this one,"If you love dancing and/or music, and if you are looking for a good workout, this is NOT the dvd to buy. The music is canned, extremely repetitive pseudo-jazz and it quickly becomes tedious to listen to; it certainly doesn't inspire the ""light-hearted"" dancing Moreno mentions. The moves are uninspired and have little to do with dance today. The choreography reminded me of the worst kind of jazz/Broadway routines that you might see on a cruise ship ""80's Night"". I did break a very light sweat while doing this workout, but only because I used the many boring, repetitive marching sections and teaching sections to do my own thing or continue at the slightly higher intensity of the actual dancing. If anyone reading this could recommend a fun, modern and upbeat dance dvd to work out with, please tell me what it's called!"
1,You call this a workout?,"The routines on this video were so slow and lackluster; thanks to the many, many pauses to learn the dance steps, my heart rate never rose, and I never broke a sweat. Moreover, the music was awful: canned elevator music with no beat, and Patricia Moreno's demeanor was very irritating and condescending.I am certainly not a dance expert, but there must be a way to incorporate dance moves into a lively, upbeat aerobics routine that keeps you constantly moving and thus gives you a good workout! If high-impact exercise is what you are looking for, leave Patricia Moreno and her simpering smirks on the shelf."
1,Repetitive and boring,You repeat the same moves about a million times. Although the moves are fun and the instructor is pleasant - she way overteaches them and it gets incredibly boring.
4,A nicley done book.,"I read the book for my sociology class and I will say that I am impressed by it. It is written very well and Huang Shu-min did a great job conveying the changes in Lin Village after the Chinese Communist Party takes over CHina. The book can be challenging to people, especially those who are forced to read it. An I feel you have to have an interst of Asia to actually get into the book. So if you do have this intrest, I recomend that you buy it."
4,High Quality 70's Italian Prog,"Having been a huge fan of PFM in the 1970s, this cd ranks among the best of that genre and time period. For my tastes, Italian prog is a hit or miss proposition (both between groups and within album selections) as the vocal arrangements in particular frequently can grate on my ears. This album has an element of that, regardless the vocals /melodic lines are interesting and the musicians are top notch. If you are a fan of Italian prog (particularly groups like Banco and Le Orme), I think you will find this cd well worth the investment!"
4,"The same consideration as the previous l.p,but more refined","Well this album has got the same reputation like their previous one,even though it's more refined!! Naturally the tracks are just a little bit better structured, longer and softer as well...besides some spare references to jazz music, broken up by other songs with classical instrumentation such as harpsichord and good strings, make this album quite worth checking out! Well perhaps it's less accessible than their debut album, nevertheless you find an original symphonic style, enriched with odd instrumentation (of course in comparison to the usual set of prog rock)like the clarinet and saxophone as well ! The good vocal harmonies complete this worth album.Recommended..."
4,Great Treat!,"It was a pleasure listening to this project. You can tell by listening to each note and each word the heart and care with which it was put together. This is a real blessing. There is a little of everything, classical, latin flavas, urban contemporary (r&b;), little jazz and some traditional. My FAVORITE JAM is ""vessel""! Oooooooo! You have to listen to that one to know what I'm talking about. This is definitely worth your 15 bucks!RKIII"
3,dangerously exciting,I would watch anything with Donnie wahlberg in it. This had a lot of shooting and killing but it felt exciting to watch.
4,I did not think it was that bad!,"Donnie and Jason are fly, as usual. The movie is not that bad. However, the music really sucks. I actually thought it made the whole movie feel worse than it was."
3,An stronger second Element,Obviously to some extent stung by overwhelming criticism of Elements Pt 1 the band respond with this effort. And it's pretty good. Anyone trying to convert a non-rock listener to the point of view that this music takes talent and isn't just a bunch of derelicts banging away on their instuments should buy them this. A lot more genuine feeling than the first Element and more body to the songs. Timo Kotipelto has the pleasing opportunity to do less bellowing and lets the songs breath while this still sounds like a working rock band. Where this Elements stuff would of taken the band eventually is anyones guess given what subsequently happened to the band.
3,Stratovarious - Decent,"This is the only Stratovarius album that I own. Apparently it is a sequel to an earlier release. This is bombastic power / progressive metal. The music is all big loud guitars, soaring vocals and the occasional keyboard solo. I like this album ok although there are other bands of this ilk that I like better. It is a bit difficult to judge from just one album. I like it ok, but it does not blow me away."
1,don't bother,this is not a super audio cd. the songs are not original recordings. don't waste your money.
1,NOT the original recordings,"Refer to the title of this review. I would give it no stars, if possible. The case is worth more than the CD."
2,Hard to say...,"As a non-Jew I was hoping for a way to learn more about the orthodox life, but I'm not at all sure I found it in this film, interesting though it was at times. I certainly appreciated hearing Yiddish...something I had never been exposed to at all and was thankful for the subtitles.I think some of the meaning and the questions presented were sincere and reasonably well conceived, yet the obvious effort to be edgy and raw with ugly street language, doping, sex, etc. made the film into something rather mundane. The acting was okay, direction okay, production in general okay...but overall, at least for me, it was disappointing and no better than two stars."
1,Not what I was expecting,"What I was expecting - Chessid leaves community to explore outside world, Chessid discovers that life anywhere without G-d is empty, Chessid returns or at least continues in observance with new found appreciation. What Mendy is - a poor quality film (cinematography and acting), about two former Chessidim who get kicked out of the community and find a greater appreciation with the outside life of promiscuous sex and illegal drug trade. This movie was filled with useless profanity and nudity. I was sorley disappointed. Anyone want a free copy of Mendy???"
3,"Looks Nice, Folds Flat, Doesn't Hold Much","Folds up flat for easy storage. Holds plenty in the ""V"" rack and flat tray, but the ""spikes"" on the end won't hold much. You'll see the vendor image shows a coffee mug, don't imagine you'll hook any glasses taller than that. The whole rack will just tip over or the glass will slip off and crash to the counter."
1,disappointing,Product has nice finish and is a good size. Delivered promptly. But design is very flawed. Would not stay open due to the manufacturing and design. Absolutely no good and will be sent back very soon.
5,No more wooden racks for me! I love this one.,"I used to buy wooden racks which would last a year if I'm lucky. They always start coming apart. So I thought I'd give metal a try. This rack is great. I'm single, but I cook for friends often, so the rack gets a work out. It's perfect for my smaller kitchen. Now, if you have huge heavy pots, this rack is too small for you. But otherwise, I'd recommend it."
1,do not purchase,"All those other reviewers who said that this dish rack is too small for actual dishes are correct. It doesn't fit standard sized plates and certainly not stuff like cookie sheets, etc. (as did my most recent dishrack). THis is due to poor design, not size. Do not buy."
1,My plate broke !,"I have the dish rack for 2 days now.Just now as I was doing dishes, it somehow folded and the plate that was on top - fell down and broke"
1,Doesn't stand up,"It seemed simple enough to pull it open and stand it up, but the grooves in the bottom are too smooth and it doesn't catch. Quite worthless as it doesn't stand. Save your money and buy something else."
3,Not bad for the price.,"It sereves the purpose, but the build quality is quite bad. Unless we have something heavy in the base part, the upper racks dont fit well enough that plates slip down."
2,Disappointing- A Good Design Goes Meh,"This rack looked a bit more clever than the usual dish dryer rack. It folds, and unlike the bamboo version of this design- I thought it wouldn't get moldy. Upon arrival, the rack set up nicely, only we discovered it is too large for the large dish drainer board we ordered with it. So it slides around a bit. And then it collapses when you put large dishes on the rack- so basically it's useless unless you wash only 5 dishes at a time. Disappointing, as the design is a good idea- just looks like it was shoddy in the execution. Waste of money."
1,flimsy,"I received it yesterday and went ahead and used it. The thing collapsed after I put a few items and broke a few glass items. Also be aware that a ""normal"" plate will not fit as the picture shows. This rack will fit small plates. Needless to say I just threw the damn thing away. I didn't bother boxing it back up and returning it."
2,Worst rice mix I've ever had.,"I'm from the South, and one day my ma cooked some Zatairain's Red beans and rice. Mmmm, delicious. So, a few days ago I got this Mahatma mix. I don't like Mahatma's white rice, but I liked their Long and Wild Rice mix, and have had their yellow rice a few times, although it is sort of bland in large amounts. I wish I had gotten Zatarain's now, because this stuff was edible, but the spices in it are rank. It's almost a bitter taste. I tried a little bit with some hot sauce, and it was awful. I don't think anything can fix this rice. I sometimes mix pintos and basmati together, and that tastes better than this. Although, one time I mixed black beans and basmati, along with some other things and that was worse than this, so this isn't the worst rice I've ever had, but it is the worst mix.I'd recommend going with one of these instead:Mahatma Long/Wild Rice mixLipton mixes(I like Herb/Butter and Long/Wild the best)Zatarains Red Beans and Rice"
3,Just one bag - Read description quantity carefully,"It's my own fault, but I thought this was was for multiple bags, not just one bag. It turns out to be a very expensive package of rice and beans. Again, I take responsibility for the mistake. I had looked at several options before choosing this one and somehow mixed up the information.The quality of the product is awesome. Mahatma is always good. The packaging and delivery were excellent. I received my order within two days of placing it. Just make sure that you know exactly what you are ordering.Kate"
5,Convincingly Psychedelic,"This album is just awesome. Totally mind blowing. Interesting, strange, melodic, filled with oddball instrumentation somehow worked out so as to be catchy and weird at the same time. I've been really digging this record for a few weeks now and highly recommend checking them out."
5,From This View,This is the best album. I've been off instrumental bands for like a year. I've hear a lot of bands that sucked and have told people so. This band sounds like the Doors keyboardist going all the way with Allen Ginsberg. Older material may be less interesting but this album pulls it all together. Pick it up!
5,Just in the middle of the target,"This small book speaks about Wagner's aspects that are the very most important in his real profile. And best of all, it follows (or he, Magee), the most adviceable use in Southern Europe, not to make a mixture between the genius personality and private life with his splendorous and unique art. We do not see Wagner as a relative or friend but as the most spectacular intuitive artist of the history of art."
5,Best wee book on Wagner,"The kind of book you buy several of to give away to friends. Short, to-the-point, lucid, wide-ranging. The author has a readable style and, well, knows what he's talking about. Good job."
5,Cute and fun lampshade!,"I love all things having to do with beaches and Hawaii. My office is done in greys and blues and this lampshade was just an added touch of fun to go with my theme. The colors are bright and it is great on top of my lamp. Very well made, too with ""handstiched"" details."
3,A great place to start.,"If you are giving casual thought to cookbook writing, this book will provide the overview you need to understand the possibilities. It will either (a) develop your craving to create a cookbook, or (b) clarify that you don't quite have the appetite for such an undertaking. I wish the author had covered topics in more detail (but I always think that) and I wish the author had drawn from experience and stories beyond her own. But that aside, the book covers a lot of ground: creating cookbook concepts, getting published options, writing guidelines..... And should you decide you are moving forward (which I did), you can find greater depth of detail in other places (which I have). For example Recipes Into Type is an excellent reference on the technical details of recipe writing, but decidedly too dry for anyone not completely immersed in such activity. Writing Recipes is a fast, fun read. And, for me at least, it sparked ideas and motivation."
4,Kids loved the movie,We ordered the movie during the Christmas break. All my kids loved the movie. The movie itself is in good conditions
2,Strange Movie,I saw this movie as a child and thought I'd purchase it. Of course the technology of making movies wasn't what it is today. Didn't enjoy it at all. It is about WWII and how Mr. Limpet wins the war for us as a fish. Children wouldn't find it funny either. Don't recommend it.
3,Incredible indeed,"A cutesy film about a meek man (Don Knotts) who somehow ""de-evolves"" into a fish. The animation & live-action scenes work quite well. It may be enjoyable for kids and for those who remember it from the 60's and relish it for notaglia purposes."
2,poor packaging,"All in all the DVD is good. My complaint is that upon arrival the DVD was loose in the case and sliding and bouncing around. This left a small scratch and the edge of the DVD is chipped. It is however still playable. Should have been packaged better. I paid for a brand new, undamaged product. First time ordering movies from amazon so we will see what happens next time."
5,Mr. LImpet brings back memories,"I was walking through a local store recently and saw copy of the movie, Mr. Limpet, with Don Knotts. I loved that movie as a kid and wanted to get it. It was priced at $10 at the store, so decided to try Amazon. I was able to get it for a much better price, plus no shipping since I am a Prime Shipping member. I got the movie and watched it with my nephews and great nephews and the loved it to."
5,Good Comedy,"Always love old humerous movies. This is a great one, shows what our Navy should have been working on. Ok, maybe not exactly but is a good movie."
5,great movie,My mother has Alzheimer's. she has trouble concentrating but she is able to sit and enjoy this movie many times.
5,The Incredible Mr Limpet,"This is a wonder family movie. Our whole family enjoyed the movie even our 16 year old and 13year old enjoyed the adventure of the ""Incredible Mr. Limpet"" played by Don Knotts."
4,Fun For The Whole Family,This was a wonderful movie. I'd seen it as a kid and I watched it with my kids. Excellent entertainment.
2,Scared my toddler,Knowing this was a kid's movie I thought it was a good one for my child to view but honestly I was surprised at her response! She was scared from the moment the guy fell into the water and when the fish did that sonic yell thing he does to scare other fish away. With a rating of G you would think it would be fine but then again my child also gets scared during princess movies with witches. Just letting other people know in case their young child is also this way.
3,Live action with animation.,"Certainly a Don Knotts classic, but where lurks ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken""? It has been a while since I have seen either film, but Mr. Chicken knocks the socks off of Mr. Limpet! And you don't have to watch seemingly endless stock footage of boats cruising through the Pacific. Just my opinions though."
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A pretty ridiculous amalgam of animation and live action that has a man turn into a fish and then help defeat the Nazis, The Incredible Mr. Limpet is just about as dumb as it sounds--kids might like it but adults are likely to spend the whole movie rolling their eyes."
4,For kids of all ages,"Don Knotts is a classic. As hokey as this movie may be, it is great for the whole family. It brought back some of my youth, (not a lot, but some).The use of the live action and animation was well done. The DVD quality was excellent."
5,The Incredible Mr. Limpet,"Oh this one is a must have for those who grew up watching this movie and those who are young and want something to chuckle over in delight. Yes, Henry is a misfit who actually gets his wish!! The animation is well done for it's time and this DVD is well authored. Everything is crisp and new, all over again!! A fun time for all!!"
3,"It's ok, but not worth watching more than once","I bought this as a family move based on all the high reviews. We sat down to watch it last night as a family and it seemed to take a long time for the movie to go anywhere. My daughters we bored and running off after 10 minutes because it wasn't keeping their attention. If you don't already know, Don Knotts' character turns into a fish after wishing he was one and then later on helps the US Navy find U boats. The animation is pretty boring, but since it was made in the 60's, I should have expected it. The acting seemed to be over done by everyone but Knotts. Is the story line unbelievable? Yes, but aren't all animated movies? My husband and I had a few good laughs but the kids gave up on the movie long before it ended. Not sure if we'll be watching it again therefore I wouldn't recommend you buying it unless you've seen it. Rent it first and see if this is a movie you and something your family would enjoy."
4,A good kid's movie,"I saw this movie when I was a kid, and wanted to see it again. It was as good as I remembered. This is a quality movie for all ages."
5,Awesom Service,I received the DVD before expected. It is in excellent condition. I am so glad that I purchased this item. I watched the movie when I was a child and now my grandchildren can enjoy it.
5,Terrific movie for Don Knotts fans,"Can't believe as big of a fan of Don that I am, that I haven't seen this gem again since I was a small boy. Still has funny moments from Don. In fact, the whole cast was very good. Get this film at this ridiculous price."
3,Good for the kids.,"Don Knotts plays a man who turns into a fish and then helps the U.S. navy in this goofy movie. Although it is unbelievable, it is clean and funny for the kids."
3,Memorieeeeeees,"I had to get this for moms. This brings back some serious memories from my childhood - namely watching this with mom back in Elmira NY. The good old days.As far as the film itself, just another great in the line of works by Knotts. And definitely on the cutting edge for its time with the fact that more than half of the movie is animated, incorporating real life footage with the animation, etc.A great one for the collection."
4,Family movie,"I like the older family movies and musicals with a cute story that anyone can watch. There is no violence, and that is awesome!!"
3,Be prepared for animation but is true to Barney's character,"This is almost 100% animated (except for beginning and ending wrappers of real film) but Barney's (ok, Mr. Limpet but you KNOW you think of him as Barney) voice and character comes through. The reason it doesn't deserve 4 stars, even from a die-hard Barney fan like me, is the animation but it's the only way this could have been done. It's enjoyable but the least of the post-Any Don Knotts movies."
3,"Good, but not great","This is a very good movie. It's funny, and very original, a great take on wartime issues.However, the only downside is that Don Knotts hardly appears in the film. Of course we have him lending his voice to Mr. Limpet as the animated fish, but we hardly get to SEE him.I think most people will agree with me that not actually SEEING Don Knotts really hurts this film. Much like Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom, Don Knotts is an actor more known for his striking good looks than his actual acting ability. I'll never forget his sensual performance in ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"", or his raw, animal magnatism in ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken.""So if you're a fan of Mr. Knotts' work, stick to films where you can see his best asset, his amazing body."
1,Mr Limpet Not So Incredible,This is a dated antique of a film that reminds me of my youth in my hometown...I thought I liked this movie so much I took a date on Friday and a different girl on Saturday. How stupid? This movie looks as dated as I feel. Don Knotts is corny...and Jack Weston is absolutely unlikable in this film...The actress that plays Don Knotts' wife is such a terror you wonder why it took him so long to jump in the ocean in the first place. This movie is as confusing as a room full of lawyers licking their chops over an accident victim's settlement...and just as entertaining.
1,Something is Fishy,"This movie stinks like blue fish in a friday sheets event...Knotts, the man who looks like he should be on a milk carton, is one of the worst actors ever....His annoying voice, the way he makes those stupid, rather banal attempts at humor sicken the very soul of me, and I am a man of the cloth! He should be run the heck outta the biz, man, and sent on the road riding a super charged up bike with Babe Ruth and his baby clinging to his backside in pain, man, in pain!!!!!"
5,Sharing a memory,I purchased this movie as a gift for my 51 year old daughter as a surprise. We were having dinner together one evening and started to share memories of our favorite tv programs and movies from our chilhood. Her face lit up as she remembered the noise he made and her joy made me want to find it for her to see again. The movie arrived quickly and was of good quality.When we gathered together for Christmas we watched it once again and for a while were transported back to another time in our lives and shared the laughter again that we did so long ago
5,incredible mr limpet,"wonderful movie, i think its great imagination , along with this movie i also have the ghost and mr chicken and i really think , no one could ever fill don knotts shoes , hes hilarious , hes a natural."
3,Ehh...,"Uh yea...I was kind of bummed when I got the shirt because the picture of Borat and the ""NOT"" Part are on the back side of the shirt. And I REALLY wanted it to be on the front! But I still love the shirt, I decided to part with it."
3,Could be better,"I was hoping for more infomation about the deselect and apt-get processes. As these are the core of Debian installation and upgrade management, they probably needed more than half a dozen pages to expalin them.The rest of the book is pretty standard, but useful, set up info for Linux in general."
5,Stupendous new artist! Don't miss this album!,"Hanitra was voted best New Artist at the 2000 Jazz and World Music Festival in Vannes, France. And that's a clue that we have a new and talented world artist here who will probably cross over from World Music into at the very least, Euro Pop and maybe even in the US music scene as well.Based on the ancient rhythms from Madagascar, the sound is fresh and inviting. There is plenty of variation, too, not just drums and typically harmonic African singing, but also ballads. Listen to the samples here: Refila is in the traditional rhythm and harmonic singing while Omeko Anao reminds me of Enya. While it really sounds NOTHING like Enya, I think anyone who likes Enya would love this album. Listen and see if you don't agree this is an album not to be missed."
4,Great album,"This album has been one of my favorites for years, with a huge variation between tracks. The opener, J-Walk's This is a Soul Vibration is just an amazing track. Gus Gus, too, pairs well with Bjork, and DMX Crew lightens it up a little bit. A couple of the tracks are a little abrasive, but all in all, this is a great find."
4,For hardcore wargamers,"Europe in Flame is cheaper as East Front II alone (and you get West Front + expansion packs for free). However you might want to look at World at War: 40$ for Europe in Flames + Bombing the Reich (East Front 2 expansion pack which has some nice night scenarios) + Rising Sun Gold (the better one). Look at reviews of East Front 2 and Rising Sun. I played this game on an old 333Mz computer and it worked just fine. However this is a game for people how enjoy classic hex based wargames (slow, complex, historically accurate...). The nice 3D eye candy doesn't change this. Hope you like it."
1,Abysmal - A true abomination of game.,This game is deplorable and the customer service is unexistent.Do yourself a favor and burn a copy from a friend. This game aint even worth the material it is made of.
5,Gets Better With Every Listen,"I bought this CD on the strength of ""Treason"", and I was a little disappointed at first because the rest of the tunes don't rock quite as hard as that one. Or, that's what I thought until I heard ""Let You In"". But the more I listen, the more I LOVE this disc. The crunchiness is tasty, and the lyrics are outstanding. If this genre is your thing, GET THIS CD!"
5,Great CD that is definetely worth buying!,"I have very paticular music tastes and it's always been so hard to find a CD that I ""LOVE"" instead ""kind of like"". I love Newsboys and they were the first Christian band that I really enjoyed. Then, while I was scanning the Christian CDs at my local store, I saw Kutless and thought, ""Eh, why not."" Now, I am a diehard Kutless fan!!! The lyrics are so wonderful and they provoke strong emotions. It's pretty amazing because I'm now calling ""Perspectives"" my theme song. It's probably my favorite song in the whole world, I'm not kidding. I didn't really like their first CD, so I didn't buy it, but I've really enjoyed ""Sea of Faces"". I've also purchased ""Strong Tower"" which is more of a worshippy worship CD then ""Sea of Faces"". Definetely buy this CD!!! :-)"
4,"Very Good, but.....","This is a very good album by a great group. This one is a little more mellow than ""Kutless"". I gave their self titled CD a 5; however if you thought that one was a little too hard, then you will love Sea of Faces. I personally liked Kutless better. Over all, this is still a really good CD and definetly worth buying."
5,Wonderful!,"The lyrics on this cd are amazing! I especially love ""Passion."" It describes just how I feel about Christ. The album is beautifully written with the sweet sounds of bass and guitar. I'd recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys the sounds of Linkin Park but wants to enjoy heartfelt worship. Definitely worth the money."
5,This is an Awesome album!,"This is just there second album but in my opinion there best album. They start things off with ""Not What You See"" which is an awesome song that brings a great message and then the 5th song ""Let You In"" Is probably as hard rock as Kutless gets other than ""To Know That Your Alive"". ""Let You In"" Is my favorite song on this album it features a great messege on how you should let Jesus into your heart. The messege on ""All Alone"" is very good as well. This album is my favorite of all-time and if you like Christian Rock with a great messege it will be yours to.This is an awesome album!"
4,A great CD,"This is a good CD. The lyrics are great, and the music is great. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because although Kutless has 2 guitarists, they barely use them. Basically 2 guitarists do the work of 1 guitarist. But other than that, it is good.Check out the only Kutless fan site... http://www.kutlessrocks.com"
4,Better Then Their 1st Album,"Kutless is a typical rock group, except without the trash. Their songs aren't only entertaining, but they also talk about God, and I think that's really good. A mix of slower songs, and hard rocks songs, I hope to buy this album the next time I'm at the Christian book store. I would recommend this CD to any rock lover, Christian rock lover, and any parent looking for a good rock CD for their child."
1,Just when life is going well,"When my life is going well, I get excited because Kutless has a new cd coming out. I get it and I wanted to end life right then and their. This is horrible effort to keep things going like they did. I also think this record sucks for the fact that on the last record they ripped creed off, and now on this cd they rip Live off. The song Treason is exactly like the song from Live off of the Secret Samai record. Kutless sucks and when I go to Sea Of Faces concert. I will leave before they go on stage and Pray to God all mighty that this bands breaks up."
3,Good but not great,"I was a bit disappointed after listening to this album. Kutless' self-titled debut was harder than this. Some complained that they sounded too much like Creed, but their sound worked. Here we find them experimenting with some drum mahcines and keyboards in the background. I would prefer that they stuck with the harder edge. I'm also a bit frustrated with Tooth and Nail, who seems to have packaged ""Sea of Faces,"" and Falling Up's ""Crashings"" exactly idenditcal to that of Thousand Foot Krutch's ""Phenomenon."" Both the package itself and the production seem un-original here. I hope the next album has some more punch, like the song ""Treason"" on the new album."
2,Very disappointing after a stellar first effort,"If you aren't a hard-core fan don't buy this CD. Spend your money on their first CD or ""Hearts of the Innocent"". If you have those two, be content that you have their best."
3,Somewhat Weak,"As someone who is coming from the secular music scene, I'm not impressed with the new album from Kutless. Their first was a bit better. I gave it 4 stars. This one just doesn't cut it as far as the music goes. While some might argue that the lyrics are the focus, I can't get into the lyrics unless I like the actual music. Songs like ""Tonight"" from the first album grabbed me for a while, but Kutless has softened up.After listening to bands like Submersed, Sevendust, Seether, Papa Roach, and Crossfade...I realize Kutless carries the same problem that 99% of all christian bands do. They are afraid to just let it go and rock out. Their sound is too controlled, and you don't get that awesome feeling of being punched right in the gut, when the songs are obviously trying to accomplish it.I'm all for Christian lyrics, but the reason so many people prefer secular rock to Christian rock is that the actual music in Christian rock is too soft. Kutless is too soft."
3,A good album,"This is not a bad album at all. The problem becomes that it is a christain one. 100 years ago before humanity had advanced into an era where we do not still do not believe in such heathen beliefs, this album would be acceptable.None the less, it is good music, and if you can get past the horrible lyrics, (even if you do believe in this stuff..., they are still absolutely attroucious - I suggest you listen to atomship) he is a good vocalist, and the band plays together well.I have a CD case full of 300+ CD's, and I'm searching for some new music. So I'm going to overlook the fact this is a christain CD and give it a try..."
4,great cd,this cd is really really good but i dont think it is as good as the first one the first one has more rock than this one but this one has more styles and great songs if you like switchfoot. you should pick this up asap thanks for reading my review
5,Kutless Rocks!,"This is simply the best christian rock CD I have ever heard, I love it! The band is awesome and the vocals are too! This a Must have for any christian rock fan.KUTLESS ROCKS!!!!!!"
5,Great CD!,One of Cirque's best CD's. Has strains through it that are very similar to other of the music. Great CD especially if you are a Cirque fan. Otherwise - just great 'new age' music.
5,It's the Best!!! I love the movie and soundtrack!!!,"Hi! If you have ever seen this movie, especially on the big IMAX screen, you know what I'm talking about when I say it's the BEST! The songs that are in the background make the movie even better! I think you should buy the movie and soundtrack!!!"
5,WOW,"Exciting, energetic, and powerful are just a few wors I can use to describe the music on this disk. If ever there was a sound track that actually put the movie to shame, this is it. I'm not saying the movie is of poor quality, on the contrary actually. The movie is amazing, but this soundtrack is incredible. If the entire world listened to it at once, I can almost guarantee that there would be peace on earth.Buy it now!"
2,Derivative,"Juras seems to have recycled about 50% of the music from previous shows. His choice, but for the connoissieur of CdS soundtracks, this one is probably worth passing up..."
2,Sticker book?,"I purchased this book for my children who LOVE Pokemon. I was disappointed to discover this ""sticker"" book is actually more like an activity/coloring book with only a few stickers (16). They are for putting on the ""free"" poster which has 32 spots for stickers. The rest of this stickers come with another book. I have to purchase a whole other book just to fill the poster. My kids are frustrated that the poster is incomplete and I am frustrated that I spent more money than it was worth. Now I have to buy the other book or throw away the poster my kids worked on."
5,Over The Moon,"This Devotional is the best I've ever walked with. Each day is touches something I'm currently dealing with. I am astounded at the encouragement, peace and comfort it brings. I love the treasure that it is because of the lives of the saints that have experienced such intimate relationships with the Lord Jesus Christ and have shared their experiences and lessons they've learned."
5,My fussy baby loves it!,"Not only is this a fun CD for kids and adults, my fussy 3 month old baby really loves it. There are times when he's fussy and crying and as soon as I put this CD on and the first song starts playing, he immediately stops crying and calms down! He also hates the car and cries whenever we drive anywhere, so I have this CD in the car as well. It has made our car trips much more enjoyable."
4,Night Time,"I came across the song ""Night Time"" some time ago, so I purchased the CD for my grandson's first Christmas. The song evokes sweetness and adventure for little sleepyheads, and I hope he enjoys it! The other songs aren't as familiar to me (hence the 4 star rating), but I hope his parents will find the CD enjoyable enough to play for their baby."
4,great and prompt,It had the song on it that we wanted and it is a very nice cd. and we got it very fast. thank-you.Lynn hoblitzel
2,NOT as the title suggest,This is just another mardi-gras dvd and not filled with anywhere near enough content as the title suggest(groping). I was very disappointed.
3,Page burner,"This is a great read. I could not put it down till the end. Seeing that I have served in the Navy for 14 years, some would think it odd that I care to read this pulp. On the other hand, I like to see how other people see the Services. The story/plot is a great one for when it was written. In '99, we had no clue that we could be an actual target to terrorists.Now, you may ask, ""If you liked the book enough to read it in two days, why only three stars?"" Well, I do not like to see ex-sailors, be it enlisted or officer, make total mistakes on the day to day life in the service. Mr. Harlow, for the most part, does a good job of showing the reader a little of our lifestyle. He did have problems with a few things, a few simple little details. I did like his portrayal of the LDOs (Limited Duty Officers) and the kiss butt XO (Executive Officer) as I have seen these types myself.Overall, great read with minor mistakes."
3,Tom Clancy Lite,"Being a fan of this genre of techno-thrillers, I was eager to read a new author's entry, especially given his apparent insider perspectives. Well, his insider perspectives did not disappoint, but the flow, attention to detail, and story-telling did. The concept was interesting, and with the comic-book characters would make for a good movie. However, unlike a Tom Clancy novel where much is lost from the book to the movie, there would not be much lost from this book to the movie. Overall I enjoyed the book and would still recommend it, but like Chinese food I was hungering for more an hour after I finished."
4,Military Technology-Politics & Humour a Novel reaction,"""Circle William is a wonderfully balanced written first novel by Captain Bill Harlow. His obvious inside knowledge of the US Navy and the US Political System just added to the realism.I agree with Bob Woodwards review in regards to -""all done with great seriousness while capturing the humour in the personalities"". It was well paced and not too much technical information overload, that Tom Clancy sometimes falls into."""
5,Great Value - Great Robe,"I was really surprised at the quality of the robe. More than I, my 3 girls and my wife all thought it was an awesome robe (for mothers day) and they didn't know the price."
3,Not one of Christie's Best!,"Although I enjoyed the setting of Murder in Mesopotamia (an archaeological dig), I found this book to be rather hackneyed and commonplace, definitely not up to Agatha Christie's standards. Somehow the characters seemed to be 2 dimensional...the only character who interested me was the young man who reminded the narrator of a Wodehouse character. In fact, after reading this book, I sallied forth to the library and checked out a book by P.G. Wodehouse, just so I could see what Ms. Christie was talking about. I highly recommend the works of Mr. Wodehouse, but not Murder in Mesopotamia. While I admit that the identity of the killer surprised me, by the time the murderer was unmasked, I was indifferent to the whole case. If you want to read a great Agatha Christie, read Death Comes as the End or And Then There Were None or Hallowe'en Party....they're all much better than Murder in Mesopotamia."
3,Bad narration almost spoiled this one for me,"I love Agatha Christie and I really like this particular story. It's a lot of fun seeing Hercule Poirot from the perspective of a totally different person, the nurse, Amy Leatheran. But the reader, Anna Massey, does a terrible job on some of the voices in this one. Poirot's French accent is so thick that you can hardly understand him sometimes. And in the last few chapters, that's a big problem, as it is almost exclusively told by Poirot. She does fine with the English voices, but since she's English, that's not very hard. Even the American voices are not quite right. If I hadn't really wanted to hear the story, I wouldn't have bothered with this recording.CMB"
1,"My two cents: 1 out of 5, but for Poirot development glimmering","Anne Massey does an adequate job on the CD audio book, but my problems with it are numerous, and so I have to 'vote' - not one of Christie's better efforts: character under-development, the characters themselves (too many with too little engaging character development), and, as others have recently noted, the outcome plausibility factor. Mmmm, add: too little incentive to care about what happens: everyone's down in M'ia, everyone's hanging around being civil to each other, hop along comes an English nurse (who is not all that funny or clever, the narrator), and then we're supposed to figure out why someone is dead. Poirot is called into the scene late, for those interested. The saving glimmer in this book is a bit closer look into Poirot's own character when he responds to those around him. Christie takes more time with that than she does in some other works, making it a frustrating but nice tidbit."
2,Not one of her better efforts - very very implausible solution,"AC's mysteries usually end with readers kicking themselves for not having seen the clues that point to the murderer. In this case, the solution is so far-fetched that it beggars belief. The only redeeming feature is that the murder was committed in a fairly ingenious manner. But all in all, the only kicking you'll be doing is on yourself for having wasted ten bucks and around 4-5 hours of your reading time."
4,Good,"A good book but I've read better ones by the same author. Nevertheless, Hercule Poirot still managed to show off his great detective skills. The identity of the murderer is, as always, very unexpected!"
2,"Slow Paced, Not Witty, and Implausible Premise","I love everything Agatha wrote (well, more or less), but this book is far from her best. It drags, as other readers have mentioned, and the Christie wit is less pronounced than usual. Worst, the premise is probably her most dubious. Remarry a former spouse and not recognize him? Not likely."
2,You'll Figure Out What Happened Before M. Poirot Does,"Honestly, I knew with certainty who the killer was before Poirot showed up, on page 76. It was very difficult to anticipate how the murderer did it, because basically that technique wouldn't have worked more than one time in a hundred. And the motive was difficult to figure out, basically because there wasn't one. I bought my copy in an airport transit lounge, and it served the purpose of killing two hours and introducing me to Agatha Christie and to Hercule Poirot. Overall, though, I think I'll stick to Sherlock Holmes. Oh, and don't buy this book expecting to learn about Iraq or archeology."
3,Psychology of the human heart,"Murder in Mesopotamia is set in Iraq prior to 1935 on the site of a British archeological expedition. Hercule Poirot ferrets out which team member crosses over the line to murder. Along the way, he employs pure logic to consider motive, opportunity, and method. Circumstantial facts will verify his intellectual process. Without my spoiling the plot, I can vouch for a far-fetched incident or two. Otherwise, the suspenseful fun emphasizes psychology of the human heart."
3,superb dust collector!,"I got this to help with my intermediate Greek course; we're reading the first book of the Iliad and other selections. I found that it simply collects dust on my shelf next to all my other Loebs (which I have used much more). If you want something to help you study, I recommend the Lattimore translation of the Iliad. It's line-for-line and nearly completely accurate. The antiquated language of the Loeb and its approximate translation make Homer confusing and inaccessible. However, it is useful because if I read a passage from the Loeb, it forces me to realize what is wrong with it, so in a backwards way I have a better understanding of Homer because I know what is wrong with the Loeb and why the Lattimore is closer to accuracy."
3,Seahawks Ornament,"This ornament was a gift for my boyfriend, who is a big Seahawks fan. The ornament itself is okay, but the picture is a little deceiving. It's not as shiny as it looks. I also didn't realize it was lighted, you had to hook a christmas tree light into the top for it to light up. When we tried to do that the top of the ornament broke. Overall, it was a lot of work for one ornament! I just wanted a shiny Seahawks ornament that we could use every year. I will probably look for another one."
5,Breakthrough,"Robert Grudin is both a prolific and intelligent writer. Most of his work rquires careful reading and thought, a more cerebral approach. In The Most Amazing Thing, Grudin reached a new level as an author. Every reader wishes the implied intimacy associated with the notion that this book was written for him or her. Few writers, of course, ever achieve this intimacy with the reader. I believed that Grudin was writing this book to and for me and further that many other readers will believe the same. Great writers, like Mark Twain, routinely write or wrote on this level. This appears to be a new Grudin and one that I hope will continue to serve us tasty morsels. I recemmned this book to anyone since it seems to communicate feelings of fun without any effort by the reader."
3,Ringy-dink fight flick,"When the fight scenes in a boxing movie lack punch, as they do in SPLIT DECISION, it's the cinematic equivalent of a TKO.This is the story of an Irish-American family from NYC's Hell's Kitchen. Patriarch Dan McGuinn (Hackman) is a retired boxer and son of a former pugilist (McLiam). His two boys have followed in the family trade. Ray (Fahey) is a small-time pro middleweight and the younger Eddie (Sheffer) a Golden Gloves winner with Olympic aspirations.Ray is accidentally beat to death after he defies corrupt promoter Benny Pistone (Tolkan) and refuses to lay down against 'Snake' Pedroza (Velez). Eddie abandons any gold medal dreams for a chance to avenge his brother in the ring against Snake.(Note: Jennifer Beals has a minor role here; she is not trying to save L.A. from destruction!)Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(5.5) Split Decisions (1988) - Craig Sheffer/Jeff Fahey/Gene Hackman/John McLiam/Jennifer Beals/Eddie Velez/James Tolkan"
1,RIP OFF!,"HORRIBLE!!!Bought a 10-pack and 5/10, literally HALF of the discs were UNFORMATTED and UNUSABLE! Will NEVER use Memorex again!"
3,Doesn't work in my car :(,Came quick. Convenient cd cases to carry them in. They don't work in a standard 2009 car cd player though :(
2,Not the Best Physics Textbook,"I have used several physics textbooks both as a high school and college student. This is one of the worst textbooks I have used however. It is very inconsistent. Some chapters are overly simple and progress too slowly. Others are short, difficult and lack sufficient examples and explanations. The book rarely explains the origins of a formula enough to get a good understanding of its use. Furthermore, there are frequent misprints throughout the text. Unfortunately, most of the people who purchase this book have no choice because it is required for a class."
3,I'm on a diet!,"I kid you not--those words actually came out of Mrs. Fezziwig's mouth.Note to screenwriter: Women living in Regency (or thereabouts) England did not ""go on diets"".This is a very uneven production--there were some nice moments which were immediately followed by some really odd moments. There were moments of charming faithfulness to Dickens' novel, followed by jarring anachronisms (see above). Some dialogue was stripped of its richness and authenticity, while some was left intact.The Ghost of Christmas Past was wonderful, but I half expected the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come to stick out a bag of candy and shout ""Trick or Treat!""Worth watching when it comes on television, but I don't think I would purchase it. I preferred the Scott adaptation."
5,A CHRISTMAS CAROL Starring Mr. PATRICK STEWART,"Mr. Patrick Stewart is extremely talented actor and plays Mr. Scrooge in this version of A Christmas Carol. He maintains the original Spirit of Mr. Charles Dickens in humankind learning compassion, kindness and cared sharing with others in life. This is truely a wonderful story for all to view at this Yuletide Season of Celebrating Universal Love and Peace on Earth. The DVD version is the best quality format for viewing this Magnificent story."
5,One of my favorites....,"I like two versions of Dickens' classic tale, this one and the Muppet's Christmas Carol. I've watched this every year since it first aired on TNT. I couldn't find it this year so I ordered it. $8 well spent.As always, it arrived quick and in reasonable packaging."
4,Very Close to George C. Scott's,"I agree very much with the other reviews, but two important things should be added: 1. the fact that they actually show a part of the book that, to my knowledge, has not been put on film yet-when Scrooge and the ""Present"" spirit go out to a ship at sea and to a lighthouse showing how everyone, no matter where they are, celebrates Christmas. 2. The Cratchit family is finally portrayed as a lower middle class Victorian London family not only by how they would have looked, but, being pretty much uneducated-except for Bob-how their lower class London accent would have sounded-just above cockney. I'm a stickler for these little things, but that's what really brings this particular version to life-the smaller details!"
4,"""A Christmas Carol"" - the Patrick Stewart version","This is without a doubt the best version of ""A Christmas Carol"" that I have ever seen, and I think I have seen just about every version there is, starting with the 1950s film starring Alistair Sims. Having read the Charles Dickens book at least ten times I was pleased to note that the dialogue in this movie is almost word for word, except for a minor change here and there. The characters are true to those in the book and Patrick Stewart makes a perfect Scrooge. I would highly recommend this film to any Charles Dickens fans."
4,Great story adaptation,"I was pleased when I saw this version on TV that I wanted to purchase it. Patrick Stewart does a wonderful job as Scrooge. His interactions with the three spirits especially Christmas present are very well done. The spirit of Christmas present echos his own words back at him as a reminder to think about what he is saying. Of special note is the presentation of ""ignorance"" and ""want"" shown under his robe as the two starving children. Often overlooked they remind both Scrooge and the viewer the importance of remembering the less fortunate during the holiday season."
3,CHRISTMAS CAROL PS,It was good. The one thing that I did notice were the slight delays. I know this was made for TV and I assumed that's where the commercials were that's all.
5,Magic of Christmas,"Not many christmas films add that magic of emotion,Patrick Stewart`s role as Scrooge is an inspired performance.It seems this adaption is true to Dicken`s novel,an amazing fusion of special effects and christmas wonder to meaningful characters that have universal appeal.We watch this every year and fight back the tears by the end.Merry Christmas everyone!"
2,A great disappointment after hearing him read the story,"I LOVE Patrick Stewart and think he is a wonderful actor. I have seen his one man play of A Christmas Carol four times and enjoyed it immensely. I have given the tapes and CDs of his reading of the story for several years as Christmas gifts. He has a wonderful reading voice! He captures you and puts you into the story. So I looked forward to this movie with great anticipation. I was utterly dismayed at what I saw. It does not live up to the Alistair Simm or George C. Scott versions. The actors seemed to be sleepwalking through the roles, there was no heart or soul.Instead of buying this, I would recommend purchasing the audio CD, settle in with some hot cider and candlelight, and let Patrick Stewarts incredible voice bring the true spirit of Dickens story to you."
3,Patrick Stewart as Scrooge left me cold...,"I have to say first that I really love Patrick Stewart as an actor... and I had high hopes that this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" would be wonderful. But I have to say that I found his portrayal of Scrooge to be distant and cold (and that's AFTER he supposedly gets 'the Christmas spirit' (!). While I thought Joel Gray did a good job of the Ghost of Christmas Past, I didn't like the actor who played 'Christmas Present' (just expected someone more 'jolly' I guess) and the ghost of Christmas Future was laughable - not scary! as one would want - like something you might see in a third-rate 'spook' house. One of the things I did like was that there was more emphasis on how Christmas was being spent among the working class, poor and imprisoned in London of the day. If I could have given this 3-1/2 stars that would have been my preference (instead of the 3)."
4,An excellent version,"Its hard to do a bad version of this classic. The story line is so powerful it will carry along even a bad performance and this is far from being bad. Its very good and will appeal to people of all ages. The special effects arent my favorite but should appeal to younger people. The opening is strong and I especially like the portrayls of Scrooge, Marley, Mrs Crachit, and the Ghost of Christmas Past. Christmas Present was a disappointment. He seemed bored and almost falling asleep in his role. The Ghostly character and fantasy is much more emphasized in this version.I like it. Its not my favorite version but still very good and worth buying. Scrooge is quite fearsome and nasty in this version."
2,Bah humbug!,"If you like Patrick Stewart, you'll probably love this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" and you won't be happy with this review. If you don't care for Patrick Stewart, you probably wont' like this movie (but you might like the review;)).It is probably unfair for me to review this movie simply because I'm not a Patrick Stewart fan, But I feel that Mr Stewart did not make Ebeneezer Scrooge a real person to me. I didn't feel the emotions that Alistair Sims or George C. Scott brought to the surface with this role. I expected to see Data or Worf show up as one of the Christmas ghosts.Some went on about the special effects, but I didn't feel they were that impressive. The ghosts weren't weren't shadowy enough or perhaps I was put off by Joel Grey being a ghost. It just didn't work for me.I'd advise the George C. Scott version or the Alistair Sims version over this particular version."
2,Not the best version...,"I own this among most of the other versions of A Christmas Carol. If you are looking for the best version, don't buy this. Get the 1984 version with George C. Scott. This version is entertaining, but I think is has poor acting and lacks the emotion of the story."
2,Perhaps the most over-acted Scrooge ever...,"I'm a big fan of Patrick Stewart - But this is easily his ""jump the shark"" moment. The most overacted, one-dimensional Scrooge imaginable. I always thought the '38 Reginald Owen version was the 'bad' one. Once this one came out, the '38 version doesn't seem so bad anymore.Still, the '51 version with Alastair Sim is the standard, in my humble opinion."
4,Stewart is a Good Scrooge,"Patrick Stewart does a great job portraying Scrooge. His transformation is quite believable. As a long time Stewart fan, it was great to see him in one of my favorite roles."
5,A Christmas Carol,A Christmas Carol staring Patrick StewartOne of the best versions of A Christmas Carol I have seen. Love Patrick Stewart.
4,classic,"Patrick Stewart gives a great performance as Scrooge. Still the classic Dickens story of course, a great addition to my collection"
5,The best version so far.,I think I've seen them all (including the George C. Scott version mentioned by another reviewer). I just simply like this one the best. It has become a Christmas tradition in our house.
1,Horrible,"This is a very poor adaptation of the great Dickens classic. The 1984 "" A Christmas Carol"" starring George C. Scott is by far the best version availble on VHS."
1,Zzzzzzzzz...,"I can sum this up in 9 words:Stewart is a ghastly, pretentious trainwreck of an actor.Yes, more true to the original than most screen adaptations, but it was delivered with all the heart of a meatloaf. Stewart's dialogue seems so forced--especially when conversing with Marley's ghost. ""Why...do spirits walk the earth...?"" Very Shatner-esque. Coincidence?Scott is still the most believable Scrooge and Finney is by far the most entertaining. Unless you're intrigued (in an MST3K kind of way) by B movies and want to watch something much more humorous than it meant to be, save your money."
3,Could have been better,Patrick Stewart is a good actor but he really doesn't bring anything to the role other than the usual fare.
4,A Christmas Carol,A classic Christmas tale so well told by Dickens and so well played by Patrick Stewart and supporting cast members. Would recommend adding this classic film to your holiday library of favorite Christmas films.
2,Falls short,"Patrick Stewart is a marvelous actor, comfortable in the role of Scrooge. But for me the film falls flat: a 19th century morality tale told with turn-of-the-21st century sensibility. Alistair Sim's 1951 Scrooge -- the standard by which all others are judged -- comes closest to capturing the dark comic tone of Dickens' original story."
1,not so good,i thought this movie was very poorly cast and that this production does not convey the spirit of the story.
5,"Most accurate, awesome movie!","This movie was the closest Ive seen in comparison with the book. I love this famous Christmas story, and since there are so many different variations out there, I couldn't help but read the book. I was very impressed with how close this was with the book. I really love this version."
4,Patrick Stewart Shines,"Patrick Stewart shines in this faithful adaptation of the Dickson's classic. Stewart has a great supporting cast, especially in Bob Cratchit and family. But for the multi-talented Stewart, this is a tour-de-force. Whether you're a Patrick Stewart fan (and who isn't?) or a Christmas Carol fan, this movie is a must."
4,A Great Version!,"In my opinion, after the 1951 Alistair Sim version, this is next one of the best interpretations of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol."" Patrick Stewart plays a wonderful Ebeneezer Scrooge, and the supporting cast is equally good. A ""must have"" for the true ""A Christmas Carol"" connoisseur."
4,Christmas,In comparsion to the Alastair Sim & George C.Scott's versions of this Classic Christmas Movie this only has clever special effects with good not excellant acting .
4,"Christmas, Bah! Humbug!","Where would Christmas be without the most lovable miser in literature? A Christmas Carol, one of the most popular holiday tales of all times returns with a bang in this delightful presentation starring Patrick Stewart. Mr. Stewart's portrayal of Ebeneezer Scrooge is one of the best ever! Even if you've seen this story presented in one of its many incarnations this is still a ""must see"" for anyone who needs a little Christmas Spirit (or three). I would highly recommend this video for the whole family. It is probably the best video version of Charles Dickens' Christmas ghost story ever made."
2,Great Actor / Wrong Movie,I absolutely love Patrick Stewart but he was totally wrong for this film. He sounded like he was reading from a script instead of acting. I turned it off 1/2 way through.
3,Miss the mark,"It's better than nothing, but Scrooge was not such an over-acting robust person, as Patrick Stewart. This marvelous book has never been done accurately. All someone has to do is just use the words from the book."
3,Capt Picard plays Scrooge,This is a fairly good retelling of the traditional story. Patrick Stewart is a little bit hard to believe as Scrooge but if you like A Christmas Carol in all of it's many versions then don't hesitate to add this one to your collection.
5,HAPPY HOLIDAY YEAR ROUND,Never saw this one before until i ran across it looking for Disney version of it and feel in love with it also.It arrived before the holidays for the bigger kids to watch thank you .
2,Subtitles are wrong,"The movie is great. But I'm really mad about it because it said it had ""Spanish subtitles"", and that's a LIE! So, I bought it for my dad who loves this picture! And guess what happened? My dad can see it despite he loves it because he doesn't speak English nor French! We live in Costa Rica, and none of them are our native languages. The worst thing is that we had already bought this movie twice: first time we assumed it came in Spanish (our mistake), and this time because ADVERTISER LIES! I wish I could return it at no cost, but I will have to pay more to send it back to USA than for buy it someday with Spanish subtitles."
1,WORST ADAPTATION EVER!,"Not only is this version boring and dull, there is NO enthusiasm whatsoever from any of the characters. They are portrayed horribly and this movie is not even remotely watchable. If you want a good version of A Christmas Carol, buy the DVD with George C. Scott as Scrooge. Now THAT is a great movie! And of course the version with Alstair Sims is wonderful as well! But don't waste your time with this one, it is REALLY REALLY AWFUL!"
2,Kindle version. Too many examples unreadable due to formating problems,"This is a review of the kindle version. As this book attempts to convey a large amount of information in a small book, it relies heavily on the examples. I normally like this form of teaching as it helps me understand the concepts. The problem is that in the kindle version, a large number of the examples are scrambled. This makes it much harder to understand the text as it refers to the example. Not all of the examples are this way, but around 1/3 of them are so far. I stopped at around 80% of the way through."
3,Not what i'd hoped for,"This book gives you the theorems, with examples of how to use the theorems. However i was disappointed because i was hoping to that it would make linear algebra clearer for me. Specifically, i was hoping for proof's of the theorems, which this book doesn't contain. It is a good reference book to look things up in, but not a book for obtaining a deeper understanding."
3,overrated movie based on a great play?,"Its funny how everyone defends the movie with the ""because of the play"" mentality. The movie does not detail Blanche's relationship with her husband which led to her downfall. This movie is put together well enough but there are holes in the plot and characterizations which make it lacking complete coherency. Also the play's lovers speak of how the ending is different, which after listening makes more sense to me than the movie's ending.As usual, I judge a movie in the context of its genre. It seems people award 4 and 5 stars out of nostalgia and ""because of the play"". Since I the viewer really cant understand Blanche's inner demon very well, which at oft times is an annoyance, 3 stars."
5,A Streetcar Named Desire,"One of the best movies ever made, great performances all around, especially Brando, even though he was the only main actor in the movie that didn't win an Oscar. DVD quality superb."
2,My rating is for the DVD...not the film.,I won't go into how amazing this movie is. We all know that. What gets me is how little respect Warner Bros. pays to the classic films that built their studios. Here you have one of the best films of all time and they release it on a DVD with virtually no extras and a VERY sub-par transfer. From the moment the Warner Bros. logo pops up you can see how unstable the image is...not to mention a large amount of dirt and debris running through every scene. The sound quality isn't much better (I actually had to turn the subtitles on for some of the pivotal scenes).Isn't this film worthy of a restoration? I've run across this same problem a lot with this company's releases. I guess they know that people will buy these wonderful movies based on the reviews of the movies themselves and don't feel any need to fork out cash to ensure the quality of their products.
5,Brando at his finest,"A Streetcar is a film adapted from the broadway play of the same name by Tennesse Williams which also starred Marlon Brando, Kim Hunter, and Karl Malden. However, Blanche DuBois was changed in the movie to Vivien Leigh and she gives one of the greatest performances of her career. Brando portrays Stanley Kowalski, a violent brute who calls himself ""the king around here"", and is very upset when his wife's, Kim Hunter, sister Blanche comes to stay. Blanche is a emotionally unstable woman trying to cover up the horrors of her past through her high class attitude and elagant clothing. All of this leads up to one of the most horrifying endinds captured on film. This is one of the greatest movies of all time and I would recommend it to anyone."
5,THE MEETING OF THE BEST OF ACTORS,"In 1950, prodicer Charles Feldman brought Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando together in order to repeat their theatre-successes(she in London - him on Broadway) og Blanche DuBois and Stanley Kowalski.It became a landmark film.It is a fascinating study of old-timer classical actress Leigh - versus the method prince Brando. THEY ARE DYNAMITE together and the film remains as powerful as it was in 1951.Elia Kazan remained not ON MY SIDE however and claimed she had a small talent, but would have walked on broken glass if she thought it would have helped her career.However; the so-called purists have always been sceptical about the combination of beauty AND talent.A credit to Vivien Leigh: Like all her post-Scarlett-roles; her Blanche is a character made by Leigh and totally unlike Vivien`s other performances."
4,Brando is magnificent!,This is one film that smoulders with sensuality but redeems us all by the magnificient performance of Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando. I wonder how this thing would look in color.
2,Why is this a classic again?,"My friend has a large framed poster of this movie. I saw Marlon and Vivien Leigh I automatically assumed it was a classic and bought the DVD. What an utter disappointment! I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but sadly that was not to be. Vivien acted as if she were on stage; While I enjoyed looking at Marlon Brando's good looks, his outbursts were too much for me. I won't be watching this again."
2,Streetcar Named Desire- 1951 movie not as good as cartoon,"I remember seeing the cartoon production of this play as a child. Vivien Leigh is nothing compared to Marge Simpson, and Marolon Brando just couldn't pull off the same caliber of performance as Ned Flanders.It's your typical delicate-flower-turned-crazy-slut story. And it's jammed packed with poetic moments- one after another after another until you want to smash something- which is what Stanley does."
4,WHERE WAS BRANDO'S OSCAR??,"Although I thought Humphrey Bogart did a great job in THE AFRICAN QUEEN, he was nothing compared to Brando in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE!!This is a great movie, with a great story and beautiful setting behind it, but what made this such a spectactular movie, for me anyway, was Brando's INCREDIBLE performance. The man was a true genius, still is actually. Everyone else who acted in this won an Oscar (that was nominated for one I mean) so why was Brando left out? Who knows...either way, he gave one of his best performances ever in this absolutely brilliant film."
4,great acting in a breakthrough film,"Brando at his best: A Streetcar Named Desire may very well contain the greatest acting performance of all time. Otherwise, strong performances all around with Oscars for Leigh, Malden, and Hunter. Imaginative plot is another key asset. Strong direction is also a key in this masterpiece"
4,Movie vs Book,The moview was a great representation of the book. It really helps to watch the movie first and then read the book because you can visualize the scenes better.
3,A Streetcar Named Desire,"""A Streetcar Named Desire"" is a classic portrayal of what both money and alcohol can do. The movie also reflected on many taboo topics such as homosexuality, domestic violence and rape as well as Blanche's affair with a young man. This movie was way ahead of its time and opened the eyes of its audience as well as movies to come. Brando's acting was intense, for his emotions kept the entire performance alive. The acting of Stella and Blanche was good but their characters were much less dramatic then Stanley's, even Blanche's character did not compare for me. The movie has a good plotline but might be lost today because of its out datedness, the music in the background might just put a younger audience to sleep. The themes are central today and a remake would definitely be a hit among the lazy film viewers of today."
5,Brando is unbelievable,"I wanted to see what the hype about Marlon Brandon was all about in this movie. Boy, was I rewarded. He is phenomenal here and greatly overshadows everything else. Vivian Leigh, who plays the crazy Blanche Dubois, was a much bigger star at the time this was made in 1951, but her performance pales next to Brando who is modern, vital, unpredictable and could just as well have been something out of 2011 as almost 60 years ago. Stella is next best, doing very well showing her lust. The young Karl Malden is also good. The extras get a bit tedious, but I was fascinated by the one about censorship and the hurdles this innocent play had to overcome with the Hollywood code and the Catholic ""Legion of Decency."" You will laugh at what was deemed immoral back then, and marvel at the side by side views of what was cut compared with the restored version. We have come far."
4,Explosive,"The seamy, hot nights of New Orleans with the rattle trap streetcar thundering along outside the apartment blocks represent the superb setting for this tight, ensemble class to deliver their superb perfomances.The film resembles the stage play, with the ensemble cast acting out a drama of passion and class, that encompasses the great human themes of frailty and facade.Marlon Brando is dynamite in his famous role as the brutish, alpha male Stanley which had women fainting in cinemas in the 1950s, and ever since.A must see."
2,Non-Letterbox Director's Version,"It's hard to believe that in this day and age, a DVD company can release a ""pan and scan"" version of the Director's cut of a classic vintage film. But, they did! Although the restored footage fills in many details that were left out of the original release, and is truer to the original Tennessee Williams play, I couldn't help but feel disapointed and cheated that I could not watch the original full screen version. In addition to the screen format, this DVD also lacks additional special features that could have made it superb."
5,"Brando, Brando, Brando!","There is no more important performance in twentieth century film. Brando changed everything in this role. Humor, sexuality, and menace never were more real or beautiful. Magnificent!"
4,Marlon's accent????? What happened?????,As a southern girl I love all movies made about the South but this is supposed to be New Orleans and everybody sounds like they are from New Jersey. Marlon Brando doesn't even attempt an accent. Which annoyed me!Vivian's performance is very convincing and you will want to slap her throughout the movie for being such a weakling. At the time she was mentally ill which probably adds to her performance . Her husband thought playing Blanche onstage for 8 months would help her illness..... I know it's funny.
3,Buyer Beware!,"As a 1951 movie, A Streetcar Named Desire was filmed and projected in the Academy aspect ratio of 1.37:1 (full screen). The Blu-ray release specifications list it as a ""widescreen"" (1.77:1) presentation, meaning that picture information will be cropped from the top and bottom. Personally, I think it's shameful that studios assume they have a license to mutilate classics so they conform to today's 16:9 monitors."
5,Intense and Sexy,"This is a perfect date movie. It is intense, sexy, and packed with intellectual and emotional whallop. The actors are interesting and beautiful to look at, and the subject matter is mature and provoacative. It is the perfect setup for getting to know someone better, and a great warm-up for intimate activities to follow, or for super-intense action like you get when you put into practice the teachings of the ""New Sex Now"" dvd.God bless you Marlon, you were a true subtle hunk!"
1,not for me,"I didn't like the set up or the problems or exercises. It's not very well written and frankly for an old reproduction of a book, Amazon is selling it too expensive."
5,Great puzzle,These puzzles have been interesting to work through. I think anyone looking to work there brain a little will enjoy these
1,Don't waste your money,"While the puzzles are intriguing and thought-provoking, the solutions don't explain how the answers were reached. I was highly disappointed."
5,"Difficult, but enjoyable","I consider myself above average in math skills, maybe even in the 90th percentile, and I had difficulty solving many of these puzzles. But that is not to say that I did not enjoy reading the solutions once I had given up on the questions. The level of difficulty of the puzzles makes it that much more rewarding when you solve one. Of course, since these puzzles have been around for years, you may have already seen some (perhaps many) of them."
5,Very good puzzles book,"I didn't expect much from a 5-dollar book, but I was pleasantly surprised. Other reviewers have already covered the quality of the book, so I won't go into those details, but I have the following suggestion for you.Store this item in your wishlist and use it when you need a filler item to qualify for free shipping.Highly recommend the book."
2,not so great,"I am sorry to say that this Neutrogena lotion did nothing for me. I am normally extremely impressed with Neutrogena. But I just rubbed in the lotion and it did not feel like it hydrated my skin, also it made my body very greasy. I am now using the body moisturizer (the long bottle) and am much more satisfied."
3,mediocre,"there are some nice images in here, but they're so scattered, disconnected and ultimately ordinary that nothing stands out about the 'poems' at all. reading the amazon.com description, one would expect talented obscurity, not obscurity alone. the author's personal obsessions are dark and interesting: the despair of adolescence, high school shootings, jim morrison (who he tries to imitate a bit too often) and failed love affairs. but it is neither exceptional nor memorable. pass."
5,Worth the Extra Money,"This was actually the first edition of any Oz book I ever read, and I became a quick fan after reading this. I really enjoyed all the information included in this book. I liked finding out about Baum's inspirations and life while reading along - and I really liked that this was a reprint of the original edition, with all the original (and amazing) artwork.If you like Oz, this worth owning, you will not be disappointed."
4,Amazon - no slipcover?,Beautiful book. But one of the reviewer mentioned that he was missing the slipcover. I also ordered mine from Amazon and it too did not come with an embossed slipcover. I'm also wondering if all the other Norton Annotated selections came with a slipcover. Does anyone have any info?
4,A nice edition,"Annotation can be annoying, so I wanted to see this book in person before I bought it. I find that the notes don't interfere much with the text, the introduction is interesting, and the images are pleasing to the eye. Even the cover is well done."
5,Annotation Series,"This is an excellent book! We gave this book as a gift for our daughter, who is collecting the annotated series of books, something she hopes to use as a reference for teaching at the college level. The book is so interesting to read that both my husband and I took time to enjoy the pages, too. We learned so much about the author, illustrator and the original story. It is definitely a collectible. Highly recommend."
3,Typical Hugh Penecost/Judson Philips,"Judson Philips AKA Hugh Pentecost was a prolific writer of detective novels and short stories. Of the 20+ novels and 20+ short stories of his that I have read, none stands out as memorable. Plots are OK; characters are cardboard; and the author gets ""preachy"" at times.""The Judas Freak"" is typical. The story begins with a celebrity's career being endangered by anonymous letters hinting of some scandal in his past. The protagonist, series character Julian Quist PR genius, gets involved. Murders occur fast and furious. Detection is minimal. Climax and conclusion right out of a low-budget TV show.Great detective fiction? No. Good detective fiction? No. Entertaining, easy reading? Yes."
3,"Three stars doesn't mean its bad, just average!",This book has both strengths and weaknesses. It is very good in my opinion in giving you an overview of how to create nice looking web pages in Frontpage 2000. The book is laid out in a logical fashion with easy to read text and lots of illustrations. Its disadvantages are that it only really gives you the basics of creating web pages. It is limited in that it shows you only how to work with the pull-down menus in the program itself. For more advanced stuff you will have to go to Matthew and Poulsen's FRONTPAGE 2000: THE COMPLETE REFERENCE.Its an average book as I said. Got me generating web pages in an afternoon.
3,Of corse it has Talking it is of corse an Interview!,For one for Larose. What the hell do you exspect when it says INTERVIEW!!!!! DUH!!! an Interview has talking involved. And if you are the same Die hard fan of Nirvana as some of us others are it is Well worth the money. Love the C.d Love the talking. A must buy for the Die hard fan of Nirvana.
3,what the hell is this?,"what the hell is this cd? it should have been handed out for free. i mean, its just talking. i am a die hard Nirvana fan, but this is not worth the money."
4,Great Reading Light,"I bought this to replace an earlier version that was still working, but had become a bit slow to start up. The lamp arrived exactly when promised. It is quite simple to use. Plug it in and ""unfold it."" The Very bright bulb fires up in about 2 seconds. I thought it was just a tad slow in starting compared to the earlier version when it was new, but not a big deal. The light is excellent for reading either a paperback or hard cover book or a Kindle. The light can be positioned in a limitless variety of ways. I bounce it off a wall right behind my bed when I read and it is excellent. It seems to have little, or no yellow tones, so the contrast in type on a page is very crisp, which is a good thing for an avid reader such as I. I took one star off for the very slightly slow start. If there was a half-star possible, I would have given it 4 1/2 stars instead of four."
3,The best Dimmu release..,"The later releases by dimmu has been very weak, but if you interested in some good Dimmu Borgir albums, buy this and ""Stormblast"".This cd is much rawer then any of the other releases, all though it's not really that raw. It's got lots of synth, but not too much(like on Stormblast).Descent black metal..."
3,"Different than how they sound today, but its how they started","If you're new to Dimmu Borgir, do not start here, because this album is not representative of how they sound today. Pick up Death Cult Armageddon. But if you're a fan and want to hear exactly how it started, then pick up this album. The production is very raw - some songs would have sounded better if another guitar had been recorded, or if some of the reverb was lowered at points. But the raw feel of this album is what makes it a true black metal classic. This is not Dimmu's best album by any means - I believe the followup, Stormblast, is much better, and that's probably why that album was re-recorded over this one. But again, a good buy to complete your Dimmu record collection. Top songs include ""Under Korpens Vinger"" and ""Stien""."
3,A good album but ...,"Maybe I am not ""black metal"" enough but I didn't get into this album as much as their more recent stuff. Mind you, on the edition I have it is mentioned that the music on this cd is not a representation of what they are playing today.Being a Christian, I personally don't care the lyrics at all and it's all about the music for me.Their is some interesting parts that appear on this album but for the most part I can't say this is an album I find myself playing as much as PEM or In Sorte, however it is still a decent enough album to have in my collection."
3,AWESOME GUITAR WORK!BUT THE VOCALIST REALLY STINKS,"I THOUGHT THAT THE GUITARS ON THIS ALBUM WERE PHENOMENAL.BUT IF THEY WOULD EMPLOY SOMEBODY WITH VOCALS LIKE JON DAVIS,JAMES HETFIELD,OR EVEN ODERUS URUNGUS THEY WOULD RULE.AND THEY REALLY SHOULD RESPECT CHRISTIANS MORE TOO."
4,Very Very Good Album,This album is one of the best DB albums it is definatly not like the latter ones but its still good later dimmu borgir is sang in english and is more brutal but this one is mellow and at times viscious the recording quality can definatly bring you back to the time when it was done and you can at times listen and hear the dark force that this album is driven by...........you kno what i think im goin to listen to it nowi have it on mp3 format and will soon by the original just to have it in my collection
3,AWESOME GUITAR WORK!BUT THE VOCALIST REALLY STINKS,"I THOUGHT THAT THE GUITARS ON THIS ALBUM WERE PHENOMENAL.BUT IF THEY WOULD EMPLOY SOMEBODY WITH VOCALS LIKE JON DAVIS,JAMES HETFIELD,OR EVEN ODERUS URUNGUS THEY WOULD RULE."
5,What a great film!,"This film is an excellent portrail of an Irish-working class family. John Shea has directed a masterpiece. I highly recomend this movie. The DVD is excellent becasue of the great commentary. If your looking to have a fun dramatic experiance ""Southie"" is a great way to spend a saturday evening."
1,Are you people on a different planet?,"I've seen this movie a few times and have some close roots to the Boston / South Boston area. Forgetting any factual references and judging this movie solely on it's cinematic merit, well, it's pitiful! Wahlburg (sp?) does nothing but scowl the entire time with his friar tuck haircut and I almost break out in hysterical laughter with the Irish mob who hang in the underground dwellings in their leather jackets, turtlenecks, and scally caps. This is pure trash all the way from start to finish with Rose McGowan acting as if this were her first role...what a pathetic performance. Please, save yourself.......don't get this!"
4,"The ""real"" Good Will Hunting","Good Will Hunting was a joke, written by kids from one of Bostons wealthiest suburbs (like they would have any clue about life in Southie). If you want a taste of what it is like to be ""Boston's White Poor"", and not some ridiculous HollyWood fantasy, see this. Personally, I was not a fan of Wahlberg or Mcgowen, but this film really shows that they have some real talent. The caracters in this movie were so true to life, half of them could have been people I have known. The best low budget film I have seen in a long time. If you liked this I also recommend ""Monument Ave"", a similar movie about Southie's ""Cousin"" Charlestown (another violent Boston neighborhood)."
3,Surprised,"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. I even watched it twice. Not that its excellent, it isn't. The story line is simplistic, the acting isn't special, its low-budget. But it works. The real life locations it was filmed in and Donnie Wahlberg's effective performance make this one worth looking at."
1,(...),Do not buy this. i did it is a waste of money. it doesnt even hold my 2 games. (...) have a nice day!
2,Evslin writes this story like a classical fairytsale.,"Evslin takes too much from Shakespeare's Anceint Greece. Both the Bellerophon and Anteia seem to lack power to propel their destenies forward. Bellerophon lacks not only the courage, but the spunk of a hero of his age group. Anteia seems too passive to resist her arranged marriage to King Proteus, and even too passive to express her feelings (if any) towards the hero. Bernard Evslin attempts to write this as the first fairytale, with the hero, the dragon and the Damsel in Distress. These cliche seems tiresome and if placed in the context of the classics, stale by a thousand years. When the hero exclaims ""To Claim my prize, the fairest Anteia"" One can only remember Princess Jasmine's line ""I am not a prize to be won"""
3,Hmmm.....,"I really do not want to bash this movie too much. Number 1, I must say that I agree with one reviewer that said that this movie is a lot like Fear with Reese Witherspoon. I will even go as far as saying that I rather like Michael Welch's (Denny) performance. He did a good job playing this twisted rapist/psychopath/thief/nutjob. He can jump from a charming lover into a vicious monster with ease. I am not big on a few of other actors. Denny's criminal buddies were unrealistic. Brooke was predictable (the movie in general). I agree with others on the ending. It was poorly done. However, I have seen worse. And overall, it is not that bad."
3,PREDICTABLE THRILLER,"This movie is alot like Fear with Mark Walburg. A girl meets a guy who she thinks is Mr. Right, of course hes not. Turns out to be a person with some serious issues. Its alright. Wouldnt pay alot for this dvd."
2,good then bombs,"It was a fair movie that held my attention, almost 2 * in parts. Niave sweet teen is befriended by psychopathic who yet feels romantic for her. They are a couple of love- birds until the parents clock him after making double sure he is as sincere as he makes out. Then he turns into his true colors and girlfriend and family are held hostage.DA-DAR! !!! Super - bimbo saves the day. She has been tied up waiting in the car but manages to wriggle out of the tape. Instead of running off down the street looking for the nearest person to call the police, super-bimbo decides to take on the psychopathic And his buddies.Sorry for the spoiler but this film bombs like a lift in a shaft when the cables break."
5,Reef Fishes Volume 1,"This book is a excellent reference, one that every saltwater fish enthusiast should have in their library. It goes into great detail about each reef fish, including their captive care, disorders and diseases, compatibility, reproduction and many other topics, way too many to list. Plus, the pictures are awesome! A must for anyone of enjoys saltwater aquariums."
4,Waiting for the next edition,"What a worth buying book. This book provides an introduction to coral reef habitats and fish families. It's even suitable for a non-biologist person like me. As a scuba diver who interested in marine biology, this book written by Scott W. Michael really helped me to ditinguish most fishes I encountered."
3,De Infernali--side project of John Nodtveidt (Dissection),"John Nodtveidt was disbanding the old lne up of Dissection, so to fill his time and bilk his record label, he made this industrial/ambient album with his roomate and Dan Swano. It is ok, but be warned it is not metal, just very techno and noisy, with some tracks featuring piano, reminiscent of the instrumentals on ""The Somberlain"". Get it for 1 penny and shipping, do not pay more!"
4,exactly what I wanted,"I needed a comfortable, reasonably priced, decent sized chair and that is exactly what I got! Our 10 year old loves it. It took a few days for her to get the chair to conform to the shape she wanted it but we didn't have to remove any beans which was a plus."
4,Great bean bag chair!,"It was soft, very comfortable and big. However, the price was quite high, they should've lowered it a little. I didn't expect the size at first, but I quickly adjusted to the great size. It is extremely comfortable, to sit and read, or just relax."
3,Love is like a box of chocolates....,"There's no one in The Cotton Queen named Jenny, but at times the book does feel a little bit like Forrest Gump. Babs and Laney take turns telling their story, which have powerful moments. At other times it just feels like a checklist. JFK in Dallas? Check. Reagan for president? Check. Oil crash or rise of Microsoft? Check. The main message is that we're a lot like our mothers and we should marry the man our parents pick out for us, even if said man is a 'geek'.When it works, it's as good as anything Morsi has ever done. You really feel how the generation shaped the woman and how their own personal intolerance for seeing any other view but their own damages them. When it doesn't work, you're just impatient with them both and tired of hitting milestones of the twentieth century."
2,Too disturbing,"They advise writers to get their character up in a tree and then throw rocks at her. In this book there are too many rocks for my comfort. I wasn't able to continue beyond the first few chapters, it upset me so."
3,Good music - not worship,"I really enjoy the sound of this live cd. As far as the music is concerned, it's fabulous. However, sometimes modern worship can be a little shallow and self focused. I was hoping to learn more songs for our church's worship, but most of the songs on this cd are focused on 'me' and 'what I am going to do' and 'how I am going to be.' Though the idea is still to worship Jesus; I felt the meaning behind the songs are a little less than grounded in Biblical principles. This cd just sounds generic, with the lyrics of the songs being everything I've heard before arranged with little depth of thought. Worship should be in Spirit and Truth. It is good music, and I still enjoy listening....but I skip several songs as I do."
2,Racism and Bigotry,"I enjoyed 'The Devil Rides Out' but 'The Satanist' with its discriminatory remarks such as negroes, indians, blacks, communists and 'a normal english girl' repulsion of dark-skinned foreigners in the first 60 pages of the book put me off. Granted that Wheatley lived in an era better be forgotten but there is no excuse of such outspoken racism."
4,Pretty good,"Though I can't say it's a great book for a beginner, I can say it had some pretty good ideas for a more seasoned Sculpey artist/crafter."
5,Finally a nipple my son will take!,"I have nursed my son, but wanted to be able to bottle feed when I was not around. We have gone through so many nipples and my son refused every one. I had heard of these nipples through the birthing class at the military base. I couldn't find any in the local stores, so I was happy to find them here! My son took the bottle right away with these nipples. They are soft, and have many holes to mimic a real breast. The only problem is when he got older and started biting. The nipples tear, making them useless. Even with that, I highly recommend these to any nursing mom who wants to introduce bottles. Well worth it!!"
2,Very disappointing,Love the color and size. Disappointed with the quality. It cracked within a month.
4,the size I wanted,"It is hard to find a large long drain board like this one, My only complaint is that I wanted it in black."
3,Dish Drainer,I love the fact that the short end was the draining end. I had not seen any others that were oriented in that way. The problem I had with it was the water didn't drain well.
4,"At last a ""long"" dish drainer drain board!",I am very glad that I purchased this as I hate the short ones that are in all the stores. I love the color as I have a stainless steel dish drainer. The drain board is not very thick tho so I'm afraid it may not last long. It doesn't drain the water off so you have to do it yourself. Small problems.........I'd purchase another one.
4,good weight workout,"very good weight workout..i prefer section 1 .section 2 has more squats,or lunges ..anyway good video.if you live on the west cost where they 99c only stores i saw this video ,brand new, selling for 39c (saw last week)"
2,packaging badly done,"When I received the shampoo, it had clear sticky tape over the top of the cap. When I pulled it off, the cap came completely off. I had to put the shampoo in another bottle to be able to use it. Shampoo is great, but packaging was poorly done."
5,Pureology Pure Volume Shampoo and Conditioner,"I have tried every product for my hair. Yes, some of them worked for awhile until they were drying out my hair. frustrated I did some homework and went to salons to see what would work best. I was hesitant on buying these products. I did. great for a while didn't work. I had went to JC Penny's Solon and this really nice hair dresser recommend this product Pureology, well ever since I have been using this product it has made my hair feel healthy, and now it has volume. Love this product. I have been using for 2 years."
4,Fabulous!,"Great shampoo and conditioner! Keeps the color in my hair much longer! My only complaint is that the conditioner doesn't go a long way, but it is probably because it is a volume conditioner. Otherwise, great product! I'm very happy!"
4,quick delivery but wrong item,I ordered one bottle of shampoo and one conditioner but received two bottles of conditioner.
3,Pain in the Behind,"OK, these look great, but the extra piece underneath is one more thing to screw in, and the face plate itself is extremely difficult to remove. I had to take this off to reach the reset tray at the bottom of the switch. What a pain. I give it five stars for beauty, one star for user friendliness, to average 2 1/2."
2,Stainless Steel label misleading,"Thin veneer of brushed SS on black plastic, so if black plastic wouldn't look good on your wall, you probably won't like these. Buy a single to check it out before buying enough to finish a room/house. Installs easily enough, just doesn't look as nice as the straight on view photograph implies, as thats the only angle that really looks nice and/or SS."
5,Pretty good Compilation!!,"This Death metal compilation features many good songs from death bands, some of these songs are really awesome, like ""forgotten sunrise"" from Amorphis, ""Night's blood"" from Dissection and ""sons of fate"" from Pyogenesis. Not all the groups here belong to the same style: Dissection is more Black metal, Amorphis Melodic death metal, and original groups like Gorefest and Exit 13 mix together in this cd. If you Like Death\black\thrash you'll like this album."
5,Another favorite!,"I loved reading about our hero, Guy, struggling with his desire to rescue Suzannah. She tries so hard to be self-reliant and she succeeds on several occasions. But Guy - well he finds out that he can't go on without her in his life and so continues to try and rescue her! I loved how he goes nuts when he doesn't know where she is! Betty Neels describes his reaction so well. This was a great story!"
5,Great book,This is a classic from my childhood that I am so happy to share with my children. Wonderful pictures and the rhyming keeps everyone in a trance.
3,Same story different place,The concept was what you would think happen I was shock to see Eichhorn take off her clothes so much. She really wanted to be the action star but to me just didn't have it down yet. There are a few good parts but you get to the point you want it to end.
5,Great condition,This item has been out of print for some time and I was pleasantly surprised with the outstanding condition of the book. It is a great reference with good simple wild game recipes. It even has suggested menus for various types of get togethers.
1,Avoid Netgear At All Costs,"This Netgear Media Router was the fourth Netgear Router that I had purchased (previous ones being for myself or members of my family). The initial experience is usually okay. Everything seems to work. Then, after a few months, you have to start rebooting the router every once in a while. At some point, often well within a year, the router just gives out and becomes completely unreliable. This has happened with three of the four Netgear routers - and the Media router was NOT the exception.Indeed, I found the Media router to be incredibly sluggish (especially now that I compare it to my recently purchase D-link, which is fantastic). The USB functionality worked acceptably well, and allowed me to stream my music from an external hard drive to my laptop. But the frequent connectivity problems rendered the router useless.I've set up numerous wireless networks - this is definitely a problem with the router. More specifically, it is a problem with Netgear."
1,Decent Wireless Router but it's Supposed to be More,"I use pretty much use all Netgear stuff for my home network, including a couple of wireless router/access points. I picked up the WGT634U when it first came out thinking I'd be able to extend the range of my wireless network, plug in a monster USB drive for backup and file sharing, and then turn off my home file server.To quote the great Homer... Doh!I guess I got what I deserved for going on the bleeding edge and not waiting to see some reviews. This thing has one MAJOR design flaw that makes it basically useless for me... you can't write files on it when it's formatted as NTFS, and formatting as FAT32 limits you to 32GB under WinXP! Not only that, but files are limited to 4GB in FAT32. That makes this thing pretty much useless unless I really want to maintain 10 partitions on my 300GB drive and find a backup program that will break the file up into 4GB chunks. That's just not going to happen."
1,Seriously?,"I have installed over 20 different wireless routers. This is by far the worst wireless product I have ever seen. For starters, of the 3 computers that I have, only one could actually detect the wireless signal (coincidentally, the one with a Netgear wireless card). Even that PC could only connect to the signal some of the time. Also, despite claims on the Netgear website that it ""Works with all USB compliant external flash and hard drives"", it wouldn't work with the one I have. And, though the box advertises that it supports WPA-PSK, they fail to mention that you need to download an upgrade to use that feature. I would not recommend this device to anyone."
2,Netgear fan disappointed,I have used many Netgear products over the years with great satisfaction. This particular router was a disappointment:- connection drops off; requires reboot often- needs 2 minutes to boot! my old Netgear wireless router isup in 10 seconds- insecure: port 21 (FTP) is open on WAN. I couldn't find anoption in the config menu to turn this off - even though Iupgraded to the latest firmware on Netgear site.
3,It's ok. But not everything is working.,"It's ok for a 802G network. For the price you are paying, you have a lot more choices. The USB/FTP never worked for me. I have tried USB from SimpleTech, Sony, Lexar, and Sandisk. None of them works with the 634U. I tried flashing to the latest FW. I even tried the beta. No go. I just can't access the FTP from outside the WAN. LAN works fine. I tried calling and emailing tech support. Level 1 only ask you to reboot, rebuild your config, etc. Two of the USB I tried above is listed on supported USB drive at Netgear. I seriously suggest you go thru the Netgear forum first before buying this router.I kept my 634U not giving up hope that Netgear will eventually fixes the problem.Menu and configuration are very easy to configure. Menu is the same as the other Netgear product. So if you used Netgear before, the configuration is eary. Reboot on the 634U compare with other Netgear product does take longer."
1,Do not even think about it,"Being a networking and computer savvy user for more than a decade, I have installed and used much more complex products. This Netgear router was the worst product I have ever purchased. It took my a couple of hours to setup and get working. The remote USB drive access does not work. I repeat, does not work as portrayed. USB drive access is very slow. I repeat, very slow. Connections keep dropping in a home environment. I repeat, keep dropping in a home environment.Just wait and buy a simpler router for now."
4,Custom firmware,"I bought the Netgear WGT634U not to use as my primary router, but as a toy to play around with. The firmware is linux-based and easily modified. I'm currently in the process of replacing the existing firmware with a custom-built one (You can follow my progress <a href=""http://router.4th.be/"">here</a>). I must admit the original firmware wasn't really good, but who cares if you're not using it?. It's at the very least a great toy for the technically inclined :)"
1,Good features but would consistently drop PPPoE connection,"I bought this router to replace my D-Link DI-614+ for 802.11g support AND USB drive support (my main reason for the upgrade). However, there's a bug in their firmware that cause my SBC Yahoo DSL connection to drop after several hours of use/non-use and it wouldn't reconnect until I manually reconnect or reboot the router. My D-Link router works reliably and would reconnect if the connection is dropped. I have tried all firmware versions including the latest beta v1.3.0.0 with different MTU settings but no luck. Other modes (DHCP, static IP) seem to work fine. I have e-mailed Netgear tech support but they are not very helpful - they sent me the latest beta firmware version which I have already tried! I would stay away from this product unless you really want the integrated USB drive support and can deal with PPPoE disconnects."
1,Storage is not simple and support for it was poor,"I tried to plug in 3 drive types for external storage. This was to be a great way to have a single location for all my computers on the network. Unfortunately this USB drive does not work as promised. I used a USB drive formatted FAT32, another formatted NTFS, and finally a flash drive. None of them would work with the unit. The instructions were not working and I am faily proficient with networking. I emailed their help area and they asked me questions like ""is your drive plugged in?"". 10 emails later I could not get anyone who would have a conversation with me. I am still not able to use this router and decided to go out and buy a NAS drive that will allow me to do the same basic thing. I am returning this router for the less expensive model and plugging the NAS drive into a LAN port and getting the same basic functions."
1,Useless,"This router crashes every day or two. It has to be cold rebooted and all the connection details reloaded each time.I have already returned the first unit, but the replacement is just as bad. Even with a new unit and the latest software upgrade, this router is very unreliable."
3,YEAH....a blast of crap,there are a couple of good songs but alot of bad songs but that is my opinion..most of them sound the same i thought i bought three cds from the same person..oh well it was only a few bucks out of my wallet.
3,A good jack-of-all general information source,"Some people will love this book and others will hate it. For those with average technical knowledge (electronics), this book exposes the basic concepts of a broad array of video applications. For those who are looking for a definative reference manual, this book is a dissapointment. The topics covered are very broad and no one subjects gets a detailed treatment. There are lots of diagrams and tables with useful information, but unfortunately many are mislabled, incomplete, or just plain incorrect. My reason for buying the book was to learn more about HDTV, ATSC, MPEG and other digital video topics. In part, I am attempting to decipher some video processing software code. I actually learned enough to satisfy my curiousity for now, but this book did not present enough detail to aid my software development. Considering the price of the book and my circumstances, I don't regret buying it, but my search for a good technical / engineering reference goes on."
5,Amazing,Excellent! good theory book and covers basic and advanced topics. I am impressed by engineers who are fascinated by mathematics and theories that can never put into practice. In this book the author puts into practice with examples including commercially viable. The 2004 book is still the designs are excellent and serves as a starting point for video engineers who put their hands dirty and are not expecting someone to do for them.I wish I had known this book before
2,A shallow skim of potentially rich material,"Aside from one or two rarities to entice collectors, this offers little of great interest here. If memory serves, some of this stuff seems to have been culled from the official Web site samples. There are even recycled tracks from some of Dylan's official live albums. Hardcore completists might want it, but hardcore completists will already have it. There must be truly awesome stuff gathering dust in the Columbia/Sony vaults. Why settle for this half-hearted effort?"
1,History of the American Civil War by John William Draper,"I choose this rating because the conversion from print to electronic media is unreadable. Symbols, numbers and letters are all jumbled up. Amazon should consider removing this title from its inventory until the problem is resolved. Then I would re-purchase and re-review."
5,This tool is amazing!,"I recently purchased this item expecting big things from it as I already own most of the V28 line of tools and have been impressed with them very much. To say that I was not disappointed would be an understatement. This tool is amazing! I used it to drill about 50 1/2"" holes in approx 4"" thick concrete floor as i was preparing to put a sump pit in a basement. I drilled the holes as an outline for a clean cut in the floor. First, the tool equipped with Milwaukee's SDS bits ate through the concrete like a fat kid eats cake! This made my job that much easier with the cordless technology and I did it all in 1 1/2 batteries. I never had any downtime charging! I didn't use the chipping feature as it is designed for lighter applications but the hammer drill function is great. A must have for plumbers who do this kind of work as well as other contractors who have a need for this type of tool!"
4,another quality effort,"I liked this one, but didn't think it was quite as good as ""Casino"" or their recent double-disc gem ""The Things We Left Behind."" Nevertheless, this a fine recording from a fine band that more music fans should discover, especially anyone that enjoys ""Americana"" or quality country-rock or folk-rock. Imagine The Band trading licks with Jayhawks and that will give you a general idea of Blue Rodeo's sound. Lovely, soaring harmonies, some intense organ and guitar playing, and darn good songs. Pick any album by this band and you can't go wrong."
4,Fans of melodic death metal will love this!,"Night In Gales might not be the most original band in the world but they are loaded with talent. This cd contains nine tracks in the ""Gothenburg"" vein that sounds a little bit like In Flames and At The Gates mixed together. They mix it up somewhat with ""From Ebony Skies"", which is a mellow sounding song with whispered vocals and high pitch screams alternating over the great guitar work. They usually keep it fast and technical though, and the songwriting is very good. If you like these guys check out: Soilwork, Dark Tranquility, At The Gates, Darkane, Arch Enemy, Gardenian, Amon Amarth, the Everdawn, In Flames, Hypocrisy, Shadows Fall, Amorphis, Opeth, Death, and Carcass."
5,a good buy,"this was an excellent album. it didnt catch my ear right away but after listening to it in the car a couple times i was able to hear a lot the brillance this album has to offer. the first track is my favorite, very catchy towards the middle of the song. track 3,5,6 ahh hell they are all great tracks. worth a buying if you are into melodic metal, sample for yourself and see."
4,"Great melodic death metal, lots of talent and diversity.","Night In Gales sounds like they belong in the New Wave of Swedish Melodic Death Metal, but they're from Germany. Fans of Dark Tranquillity and In Flames will almost definitely like this."
3,Dissapointing,"I purchased this cd after hearing a bit from Night In Gales... various tracks from various albums. However, upon listening to it, I was promptly bored. Repetitive and plain, nothing really interesting on it. I think I would have been better of with Nailwork. Try that one, or go with Enlsavement of Beauty (yeah!! haha)Good enuf band tho..."
2,"NOT BAD,BUT NOT GREAT",The is loads of talent musically on this CD and lots of atmosphere and emotion through out the songs. The problem is the music grows boring fast and leaves the listener feeling like nothing stood out.I personally didn't care for Nailwork or Thunderbeast and the clean vocals on some songs but Towards The Twilight is at least an attempt to break the mold of those sleep inducing CD's.
4,Great music.,"My husband loves this CD, our son told him about it and played it for him. As soon as we got home he wanted me to order it."
3,Fab singing artist - not such great cd quality,I think Dave Stamey has to be one of the greatest cowboy country artists I have ever heard! But the quality of the cd itself is just okay - it's still worth a listen - so i would advise anyone who loves country western music to buy this cd. but better sound quality would be on my wish list.
1,hated it,"annoying characters, plot is all over the place, gets really boring very very quicly wouldn't spend money on it. sorry."
5,:),"It was realy great to watch the movie Ed Wood, and then get to actually see the weird movies he made. Great for anyone into filmmaking and/or directing. I got it as a birthday gift along with Ed Wood for my boyfriend, who studied film, and he really loved it."
5,The best of the worst,"This is probably the greatest collection of the worst movies of all times. All are the creations from the mind of Ed Wood. Most people may remember the movie of Ed Wood's life with Johnny Depp as the title role. While that was played for laughs and some pathos, the real story was not too far away. Ed Wood had a true passion for making movies. He just did not make good ones. These are all fun to watch and have a laugh at, but understand that the intent was serious movie making. It might be somewhat sad to watch the declining years of Bela Lugosi, though. Get this set to watch and have fun with."
1,Very Poor Quality - Don't be fooled by price,"This collection is absolutely awful. The quality of each print is terrible - probably from a public domain source. Images are fuzzy, during night scenes you can't see a thing, and there is the most irritating loud hiss on the audio track through out. Finally, the company has put an annoying ""Ed Wood Collection"" logo on the lower right of the picture that never goes away. Don't be fooled by the price (like I was). Let's face it - Ed Wood movies are not expensive. Pick the ones you really like and buy either the Image Entertainment versions (beautiful crisp prints and excellent no-hiss sound) or wait a few months to buy the new Legend Film releases (remastered B&W prints and Colorized versions on one CD). Don't buy this 2 DVD collection even for a dollar - you will not be able to last 5 minutes the quality is that bad."
5,"Can you say ""Vulgate""?","The Latin NT has far less notes in it than the Nestle-Aland Greek addition, though, from time to time I still enjoy reading through my Latin one. The nice point is that Latin is an easier language than Greek with the same, or nearly the same alphabet that Modern Englis has so read up and enjoy!"
1,UNFAIR STOP IT NOW MEG!!!!!,"I can't believe that Suze is like feeling things toward Paul. If you ever read this Meg, you have to stop it now! I will literally cry if Suze ends up with Paul and not Jesse! You will disappoint a ton of readers so just STOP IT NOW!!!!! I would have give this book 5 stars but with Suze feeling things toward Paul, I just can't. I know in the end Jesse loves her but what if Paul was right that he and Suze are meant for each other. I would die! Just lay down and die!!!!!!! PLEASE don't make this like in All American Girl where she doesn't love the guy she thinks she does. It worked good for that story but for this it would just be horrible! :,("
4,LOVE THE BOOK!!,Meg Cabot is a fantastic writer. And this is an amazing book. I consider it the best book out of the entire series.(P.S. I like Paul over Jesse)
3,Haunted,I thought this book was very disappointing. First of all if anyone has read the other books in ther series would know how annoying the thing with Jesse is. Really it's getting kind of old. I thought that Suze would finally come to her senses and pick Paul but she didn't so I was very disappointed. But it was still a little entertaining. I still have hope that she will get together with Paul in the end. And that Jesse will finally move on with his life well death I guess.
3,Not as great as the rest of the series,"Well if you have read the rest of the mediator books you will most likely be dissiponted in this book.You know how she has her nicknames for her stepbrothers, well she dosnt use them in this book. She calls them by their real names. It is really confusing at first , but after a while you figure it out. It isnt as funny as the other ones eather.. but it was still ok.I do recamend reading the other books first. I mean you dont have to but you will get a much better ideas about the caricters."
4,A Solid Entry for an Entertaining Series,"I first came across this series on audio book when I was looking for something light for an overnight drive. I was unemployed at the time, so I picked it up at the local library. I didn't realize the title I had picked up was the first in a series, but I enjoyed it so much that I immediately searched out the remaining titles at the library when I returned home and *devoured* them. That was almost 2 years ago, and these books still stick in my mind enough that I have slowly been purchasing the entire series to own now that I am getting back on my feet financially. While the situations in this book get a little ridiculous, the strength of the relationships between the characters keeps me connected to the story and coming back for more."
5,Haunted-Mediator book # 5,"Exceelent read. Best if you read the previous four. You won't be disappointed. Thrills and excitement, a real page turner. I highly recommend the entire series."
5,supercalifragilisticexpialidocious (good),"First of all, I would like to say that Meg Cabot ROX. That being said, I have to add that this is an extremely good book, and I read it in 45 minutes.We get to discover all sorts of things: Is Paul REALLY the spawn of Satan? Has the whole Paul thing REALLY made Susannah lose the mediator touch? Did a certain event with Jesse in the last book make their relantionship 'better'? I am certainly not going to ruin the surprise. But I will give two hints about the book just to torment readers.-Susannah is not just a mediator. She is much more.-Two words : 'Stalker', and 'Harrassment'.Of course, now you want to read it, right? Well if you don't, I have created an extremely powerful mind-control drug that causes you to fall in love with the mediator series. Please e-mail me and I will administer it cyberactively"
2,meg cabot's mediator,"Suze moves from a New York apartment to a northern California mansion and must learn to live with her three stepbrothers and go to a new 300 year old Catholic school. as if that wasn't bad enough, suze encounters two more troublesome ghosts-- one wants to kill her and the other wants to help her. which is worse?This book seems to be more like a sequel than an original--it kept throwing things at you that it expected you to know. that made it confusing to read and you might need to read it twice to understand it, especially at the end. i did not particularly enjoy this book and I expected better from this author. i will recommend most other novels by meg cabot but i was disappointed in this book."
2,Very Interesting...from and outside View,"Having read almost all of Meg Cabot's books, I was genuinely interested in Haunted: A Tale of the Mediator, The problem though, is that I was not aware of the other books Prelude to this one. So I just jumped in I guess in the middle of a big plot. While the book was thoroughly interesting and keep my attention, I do not recommend this book to those who have not read the others. I do recommend All American Girl and Princess Diaries (the full set). Meg Cabot is a truly great writer, but this book I felt lacked a lot of her more creative plots."
5,My Favorite Book That I Have Ever Read,When I bought this book I started to read it the night I got home then I got intoit so quickly that I didn't notice that I had read the entire book cover to cover in one night the sun was coming up once I was done but when I was reading I had lost complete thought to anything else I love this book so much after I was so mad! that I had read the book. But this book is my favorite ever and eny girl my age who reads only a couply chapters into it will also be hooked!!!
5,The perfect edition to the already great Mediator series!,"I love the Mediator books because Suze is such a great character, and the books always make me laugh out loud. Not to mention the fact that I love Jesse just as much as Suze does, but thats another story. This book is jam packed with romance, mystery, and action. Read this and you wont regret it!"
3,"simple, sweet, and orangy, if that is what you like.","This perfume smells citrusy, more on the orange side, and a little sweet.However, this perfume is too simple for me. For example, J'adore is a sophisticated perfume with a hint of citrus, but this perfume is just orangy and sweet, which I liked when I was a mid-teenager (14-18) but not now.If you like a simple perfume that smells citrusy/orangy and a little sweet, then this is a good choice. If you'd rather have a sophisticated than a fun perfume, then I'd suggest J'adore, it is fresh, sophisticated, lady-like and with a hint of citrus."
3,3 stars because it's part of the Happy family!,"After owning and liking Happy, I thought I'd give this a try. I got it as a Christmas present, and have worn it maybe three or four times. It's too flowery for me. I get headaches and feel like my throat is irritated whenever I wear it.I tried to love it, but I just can't... It makes a nice addition to my collection, but as for which I'd rather wear, Happy or Happy Heart, I choose Happy."
3,3 stars because it's part of the Happy family!,"I saw Happy to Be in an email announcement from Clinique when it first came out. I wasn't really interested in trying it out because I thought I'd like Happy Heart but don't. I was shopping in a department store one day and saw that if I purchased the $80 bottle, I got a nifty little tote bag with a very cute, small size bottle of the perfume. I couldn't resist!Let me just say, I love the bag, but not the perfume! It's too citrusy... I like subtle perfumes and this one is definitely strong! I think of the Clinique perfumes, I'll stick with Happy although I now own the whole ""Happy"" set."
3,"Nice, but not when it's first sprayed on","I love citrusy type colognes! This is nice, but at first it smells a little peculiar. Gets better after wearing it a bit. Nice, but not as nice as Clinique's ""Happy""."
1,Perfume: HAPPY by Clinque,Did not smell in any way similar to magazine samples. Almost no scent. Very weak!!! Would not purchase from this perfume source again.
5,great fishing line,my father-in-law loves this stuff and will be very happy with it as a christmas present :) I will probably order more in the future
2,"Love the scent, but this product is not the real deal","I love this scent, but when I compare this new bottle to the one of old it is not the same. Kudos to the rest of the people trying to warn others! The scent is fantastic, assuming that it is real, but this product is not!"
2,Disappointed with purchase from Fragrancevilla,"It is difficult to give an objective review on this, because I strongly believe I got a fake perfume from fragrancevilla. It was suppose to me a belated birthday gift which was ruined. I promptly requested a refund from this company. There is absolutely no label on the bottle (which is the case) but the the cap carried no label either). refrain from buying perfumes with no label. they are very easy to imitate. Furthermore, the perfume smells quite different from the scents at the department stores. Smelt like very cheap perfume and had a repulsive scent. I threw it in the garbage to express my disgust at this purchase."
2,Ralph Lauren Romance,I don't care for this one. Gave as a Christmas Gift to a friend who LOVES IT...Different Strokes for Different Folks............Not for me
2,Too good to be true,"Thought this was the same perfume I'd worn for the past 12 years, but at a reduced price. Whatever this is, it's not the original and does not carry the same scent all day as did the previous bottles I've paid full price for, so I'm disapppointed and won't order it again."
5,Romance Is Blooming,"I have tried Ralph Lauren's ""Romance"" Eau de Parfum Spray and I love its lush floral scent, so romantic and sophisticated. I use it only on very special occasions and I've often been asked: ""What perfume are you wearing? It smells so good."" I spray it behind my ears and wrists for a long-lasting effect. So leave a scent of you behind with Ralph Lauren ""Romance"" Eau de Parfum Spray.A perfume that means always and forever in bloom.Wholeheartedly recommended."
2,Disappointed,"As directed. I expressed my dissatisfaction to the vendor. As a long time user of this Eau de Parfum, I was pleased to acquire it at an economical price. The scent I received was weak and not the fragrance as fully developed as I am accustomed to. I expressed my concern about the shelf life of the product I received. The vendor assured me that they receive shipments routinely from L'Oreal (??) and there was not a problem with shelf life, further suggesting that I compare the product they shipped with a similar product in my local department store, offering a refund if I was still dissatisfied and returned their shipped parfum. In fact, I did that. There was a substantial difference...and I was careful to be comparing with the Eau de Parfum, not the parfum . At that point, I decided it was not worth the time and inconvenience to return my bottle. I will just consider it a lesson learned about reduced priced perfumes. THEY DO HAVE A SHELF LIFE AND HOW THEY ARE HANDLED DOES MATTER."
3,Ralph Lauren 1oz. perfume,"The product seems to be OK, but I was surprised to get the travel atomizer and not the small regular bottle. Also, the box did not have the sealed plastic wrapping that my other Ralph Lauren purchases always have. It made me wonder if it was legitmately Ralph Lauren."
5,Service & Product,The service provided was very good....for a beautiful perfume that is my dtr-in-law's favorite! Worth every cent!Rita in Costa Rica
5,Amazing,"This is a ""magnifiscent"" item. My girlfriend is in love with this perfume. It's sexy, but not to strong and harsh."
5,love it,"I absolutely love this scent. I have had my bottle for at least 4 years and I still have half. I don't use it everyday because I save it for the special occasions. But I have not bought from amazon before I got from dillards. I have found knock offs though at flea markets and have passed because they were awful compared to the real thing. So I'd suggest purchasing from good reliable source, you get what you pay for."
5,Teen ager loved it,Bought this for my 16 year old who plays goalkeeper for his high school team. He loved it. He has read and re-read several times now.
4,"One of the ""must reads"" that you will actually want to read","As you can probably tell from the cover art, this book is about soccer. But don't let that turn you off (no offense, soccer players). Keeper is about so much more than just a sport...it is a gripping story that will keep you longing for more. Mal Peet has an amazing ability to put into words the undescribable. I don't particularly like soccer, but I found myself caught up in his outstanding play-by-play. If I was a reviwer at a well known newspaper, I would have no choice but to be cliche and be quoted that this book is ""the summmer's must read!"" Seriously though, read this book."
4,Better than expected for the money,"My boyfriend purchased this item for me a few months ago because he knows I love to cook and didn't have a ""good set"" of knives. At first I was skeptical at the idea of something that was originally sold via an infomercial, but I've been using these knives and have fallen in love with them! Sure, they're not as heavy and thick-bladed as Chicago Cutlery or Henkels, and the handles are plastic, but they're sharp as can be, and they retain their edge extremely well. These are great knives for the money!"
2,You get what you pay for!,"I was looking for a set of steak knives and came across the infomercial one night. It sounded great and much cheaper then the Henckels of the world. And look at all the different types of knives. NOT WORTH IT. These knives don't cut well at all (as compared to my Henckel knife). I wish I didn't buy it and just purchased a couple of good quality knives.Also, the block holder is HUGE! It takes up too much space."
3,"Average value, lacking measurements","Quiz: What is the size difference between a cookie, cracker, pickle, and a pretzel jar?Don't know? This book won't help. Many of the listings lack physical measurements, cutting the value of the book in half. This is particularly crucial when looking at stemware and bowls. Unless you carry a measuring cup with you, the capacity in liquid ounces in some listings won't help either. Means you'll have to lug around the other books, defeating the purpose of having a separate Value Guide.The book seems quite complete otherwise, and has clear pictures/drawings of most patterns so you can verify price tag accuracy. No substitute for a pattern identification book, since that is not the purpose of this book."
2,The Fostoria Value Guide,"I found this book very confusing and difficult to use. There are very few colored pictures, and what there are, are not labelled. I would not recommend this book. There has to be a better Fostoria book than this. It also does not have everything that was made in a pattern. You would have a real hard time identifying many Fostoria patterns using this book."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I do not find this to be at all ""user friendly."" There are few pictures, there is little detail...no close-ups. I did not find the information I was hoping to find."
1,GE Network and modem cable is garbage,A piece of junk right out of the box. The cables were jammed even before I started. Do not buy this.
2,"Claims to be 6ft, but is only 4ft","The info listed on this page claims that this is a 6 foot cable, but when you receive the product it clearly says 4 ft on the packaging. Each side accounts for 2 feet, otherwise the product is fine. Just wish I knew how short it was in the first place because I wouldn't have ordered it then."
4,Why did Neutrogena discontinue this excellent product?,"I have been using this stuff for a few years and really appreciate the convenience of being able to add sunscreen at the same time as my aftershave. I shave my head every few days so this is a big deal. Perhaps there was not a market for this product, or they found that the suncreen's effect was limited by other ingredients? I wish I knew..."
1,cheaper comparable product in the market,"the nivea Nivea for Men Skin Essentials Protective Lotion is a comparable product thats less than half the price .All the active ingredients listed in this product are just UVA and UVB protective ingredeints . The nivea product i recommend above his most of the same ingredients and much more . In terms of my research based on the ingredients , the nivea product is cheaper and better .Also , they feel the same on the skin for me.Nivea for Men Skin Essentials Protective Lotion, SPF 15, Normal to Dry Skin, 2.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)"
3,DEPENDS ON HOW YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY *,"THE MUSIC IS SOULFUL BUT THE VOCALS CAN USE SOME WORK. HOWEVER, I CAN HEAR SADE AND TONI BRAXTON INFLUENCES IN HER VOCALS. IT REALLY DEPENDS ON IF YOU WANT TO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON A HALF DONE CD."
1,I Don't Get It!,"This is a very slow, mono, every song sounds the same much like the Nora Jones CD. I don't see the attraction to either of these CD's. The highlight for me was the title track."
1,If I could rate her Less than 1 Star I Would,"Her currently single ""Say How I Feel"" is absolutely nothing like her album.Her album is garbage in my opinion. She doesn't sing to the melody in the music, it's almost like she could have sang the lyrics to some songs to the tune of Old McDonald and it would have sounded the same.An absolute waste of money. This CD is the reason why people download music before they buy. I wish i would have done the same.Don't believe the 4 or 5 star rating. Totally inaccurate."
3,bored little rich girl,"Oh come on ..........with all the money they are spending on the promotion of this record. I don't believe a word she is singing. I'd rather listen to it as a nice smooth instrumental. She doesn't look like she really enjoys performing, but wants only to be a star.I saw her show in New York. BORING! She was beautiful for sure but that is about it..the band was smokin' but her presence wasn't felt.I want my money back....they are hyping this and that is all they're doing.............Yuck"
5,If............,"If you're looking for quality then look no further...this is it!She's mellow, soothing, relaxing and delicious to the ear!Very, very, very rich voice. I reach for this when I'm in chill mode, or when I am entertaining. Its soothing and doesn't overpower the conversation, yet you can still feel the groove and the vibe. People always ask, who is that singing?It's atmospheric...that is the perfect description of this CD!"
1,Gold Coast Elevator Music,"Categorically speaking Rhian Benson should be right up my alley. Not blatantly mainstream or gratuitous with leaning towards the spiritual. In reality, however, this has got to be the most boring set of songs I have heard in quite sometime. This CD is so very much not welcome on my shelf of Amel Larriuex, Goapele, Van Hunt, Javier, Calvin Richardson or Ndea Davenport. Any of the aforementioned would blow this disc out of the water. The vocals are boring, the music is about as inspiring as a glass of tap water and the whole set just comes off as pretentious lite-radio fare. I'm all for mellow soul mood music, but c'mon... even Sade gets funky sometimes."
2,dissapointing,"the ideal of a singer like Rhian Benson is much better than the actual reality. The album's lead single just happens to be the best song. I looked at the credits and saw the likes of James Poyser and the rest of the Axis music guys on deck for the music, and thought for sure this was going to be a great cd. I was more wrong than I could have imagined. Poyser puts out arguably some of his least inspiring music to date (get back with the Soulquarians James!), as the music is downright uninspiring. Rhian seems to have a decent voice, but her vocals are more spoken word than soulful displays of beauty. The potential is all there, but the execution leaves much to be desired."
2,Surprisingly Disappointing,"Surprisingly Disappointing. I purchased Martina Topley Bird, Thievery Corporation, and Rhian Benson and unfortunately Rhian Benson is the only one that I listened to and just did not feel. I purchased the album because I heard so many good things about the album but I was unpleasantly surprised and now it just collects dust. Maybe one day I will try again but until that day at least I have a nice coaster."
2,I'm Gonna Say How I Feel,"""Say How I Feel"" is one of my top favorite songs of 2005. It has a jazzy mid-1990s feel to it. But seriously, this woman can't really sing. She's off key and mostly talks. I have to give her credit though. She can play a few instruments and write a few good songs, but she needs to step up her game. If all of the songs on ""Gold Coast"" were like ""Say How I Feel,"" then it would've been a classic. Other than that, I'm not feeling this CD. Her vocals just mess it up. Better luck next time."
2,"I REALLY tried to like this album....but, no dice","This album is a prime example of having great music combined with weak, childlike songwritting. It infuriates me when you have great producers like James Poyser and the legendary Bob Power create instant magic with thier music and have an unknown singer singlehandedly soil the fabric of that magic. This album is so bad that I had to desperatley find a reason to not slit my writs after reaching the end of the album. And what gives with the missing 13th track on the CD?Rhian's voice is too heavy and overcompensates the melodic sound on this album. She may be easy on the eyes, but looks go a long way when it balls down to talent."
2,use caution,"Ive been using GABA calm for about a year and just switched to this powder because it contained more of the GABA. My 10 y.o. son has asd and we were treating his anxiety and nervous energy with these supplements. Unfortunately, he has now had the worst school year ever with unpredictable behaviors, agression and the like. Staff was asking us if we tried putting him on meds. As an evperiment, we took him off all forms of GABA and what do you know- He has now had the best two weeks of his life. Im not saying this product will not work, just that if you are using it on children be aware it may have the opposite effect."
3,Heard better.......,"This CD did not hold up to my expectations. The riffs were flat, the drums were mediocre at best, and the whole package was not melodic or crushing at all. I've heard much better from the Swedes, both before and after the Gothenberg phenomenon etched a place in death-metal legacy. Three stars may have even been a bit kind. This album actually deserves 2.5 stars. If melodic death-metal is what your looking for; save your cash for Gardenian, Soilwork, or Arch Enemy."
4,X-Files Death Metal!,"Swedish band Hypocrisy are truly one of the greatest death metal bands, and The Final Chapter, indeed seems to be their last album, ending an enormous legacy. This album continues the UFO and alien abduction madness that was dissected in the fantastic ""Abducted"" album... this release has all the qualities that Hypocrisy fans have come to worship - the production is utterly gut-churning, and magnifies the crunching impact of the guitars, always a Hypocrisy specialty. Songs are varied and basically follow a general pattern of: fast song/slow song/fast song/etc. By ""slow"" i don't mean your weak ballad either! I mean atom-bomb downtuned riffs and anguished cries of torment! There are also genuinely scary, spine-shivering moments in this album, and the whole idea of alien abduction is brought almost into reality by Hypocrisy... I wholeheartedly recommend both ""Abducted"" and this follow-up ""The Final Chapter"" to all fans of extreme metal."
5,Wonderfully Useful Cutter,"I work at a grocery store where we all use the old version of this cutter. I ordered this new model and have been showing it of to all of my associates. They all think a shipment came into the store but then I tell them I bought it online and they get all disappointed. Maybe I can get my manager to order up some of these :) The cutter itself works great. I can cut through boxes like butter with only a few clicks and a clean swipe. It can also take a good beating. I have been dropping it, stepping on it, throwing it among other things and I can tell you that it can surely take quite a beating. My job would be a lot harder without this in my pocket."
3,Blind picks would have been fairer,"Proulx openly admits in her intro that she didn't choose the stories blindly, and the bias shows (compared to other Best American anthologies). It's possible to still choose the best stories while knowing the names of the authors, but that kind of objectivity is extremely difficult, for anyone-- literary master or not, and the fact that she chose to not select blindly makes me suspicious: makes me wonder just how many excellent ""amateur"" stories had been discarded in favor of the blander stories of bigger names."
4,"Don't Mess with this ""Dirty Harriet"" !","Rated on a score of 1 to 10 sudden death is at the very top for sex and violence.In the venegful traditional of Death Wish comes Sudden Death, the explosive, power-packed action film starring the beautiful Denise Coward (former Miss Australia) as Valerie Wells, a new breed of female heroine.Valeries is a successful attractive career women and the object of a brutal rape by a couple of vicious thugs. The police quickly lose interst in her case forcing Valerie to take law into her own hands. Buy the move and find out the rest."
3,Italian Party,"This CD is a little carnival like for my taste. Most of the music has a polka, dance feel to it that you might hear at an amusement park or at a carnival. Fun music for some occasions, but not for relaxing with a glass of red Italian wine."
3,"It takes a certain ""kind"" to read this-","Having an understanding for Caribbean dialects would help when reading this book. The story is charged with political and religious dialogue, which I found fascinating. However I don't think this book is for everyone. I believe that the idea of duppies (spirits) having hand in what goes on in everyday life is unsettling to most people. I found that I can identify with the book easily than other friends that have attempted to read it. Its worth a try but I'd suggest getting it at the public library first. If you can understand it then, I say add it to your collection"
2,Not as good as their other albums,"If this album were to stand on its own, apart from their other work, it would get 3-4 stars from me. However, compared to their other work, it's really only worth 2 at best. This album doesn't have the true metal feel of the other albums - I would recommend Deggial, Vovin, or Secret of the Runes instead of this one."
4,non-western water supply,"This book reviews the art of roof and ground catchment systems for rainwater. The water collected can be used for household or other purposes. The designs are aimed for individuals with limited access to electricity and/or civic water utilities. The text includes drawings, photographs and step-by-step instructions.One might say the book is really written for the 'aid worker' since it also considers ethnic and gender issues that would be 'obvious' to the future owners of the the systems.If you want to build something for yourself, you might be interested in reading ""Rainwater Collection for the Mechanically Challenged"", by Richard Heinichen and Suzy Banks. Another book is ""Gardening Without Water: Creating Beautiful Gardens Using Only Rainwater"" by Charlotte Green. The first is really for the mechanically inclined."
4,This is the ONLY CD containing original hit recordings!,"Despite the plethora of Greatest Hits CDs available, this is the one and ONLY CD that contains the ORIGINAL HIT RECORDINGS of ""Durham Town,"" ""The Last Farewell"" and ""New World in the Morning.""All OTHER CDs contain newer re-recorded versions of these songs.If you want to hear the originals as you remember them from your LPs or 45s and as played on the radio, THIS is the disc you should purchase (and you certainly can't beat the price!)I have been searching for these songs for well over a decade, and this rather narrowly-distributed disc (it's available in few if any retail record stores) is finally the real deal."
4,Something of a greatest hits album,"For nigh onto three generations, Roger Whittaker's rich baritone voice and gentle guitar playing has been thrilling listeners. This album originally came out in 1997 under the BMG Special Products label. Its full title is New World in the Morning: The Encore Collection, and it should not be confused with the artist's 1971 album New World in the Morning, which come out under the Columbia label.This is something of a greatest hits album, and what makes it so good is that it contains the original hits, as they sounded when they became hits - no re-recordings here! If you've always liked Mr. Whittaker's music, then you will like this album."
2,Poor quality sound,We love Roger Whitaker's music but we were very disappointed with the sound of this CD. We probably will give it away.
1,Extremely Misleading,"Most fans of Tales From The Crypt are very fascinated when they see their favorite late night show up for sale especially when there are 39 episodes. So i ordered it and had this package timed out for Christmas .The package showed up right on time.... the only problem was that it was only 3 tapes. This was very disturbing for me because it was my big item for Christmas and i got cheated out of 30 episodes. Yeah, i know... I am supposed to read the fine print before I buy from Amazon but whoever the seller is of this product.... you need to change your damn picture because i thought i was getting the entire Crypt Keepers Dozen. This ad is very misleading and completely ruined my Christmas."
3,for diehards only,"This mCD contains no studio songs not found on other albums: ""Sane"" is on ""Chaosphere"" and ""Future Breed Machine"" is of course on ""Destroy Erase Improve."" The ""mayhem"" remix of ""FBM"" is pretty cool, but overall this purchase was not worth my money. Caveat emptor."
5,5 stars for the campfire version of future breed machine alone!,"Imagine a whole album by Meshuggah in this style?!?!!? It would be amazing and totally change things up for this band! The campfire version of Future breed machine is jazzy, funny and all around awesome. Its too bad most of their fans would not be forgiving of such a change.. Sigh... its too bad because I think that I rather enjoy this song over most of their regular style songs. Their awesome change ups and time signatures are amazing, but the constant screaming is annoying. Hopefully in the future we might see a full ""campfire"" album by Meshuggah"
5,Realistic Mississippi Life,"Being a native Mississippian and also a native of Hazlehurst-the setting of the play- it amazing how realistic the play is about life in the South. Henley's play captures the essence of family relationships, that ""crazy"" person in everyone's family, the relationships between sisters as friends, and the narrow-mindedness of people in the South. Where else but in the South would a person commit suicide just because ""they were having a bad day."""
4,"Touching, real, and hilarious","I was lucky enough to work with Henley herself on a production of this show while I was in college, which offered a wonderful opportunity to gain some insight into Crimes of the Heart. Being a native Mississippian with two sisters myself, I was struck by how true-to-life this play is. The script captures that elusive ""sense of place"" that all the critics talk about when discussing the South - crazy relatives, old friends with haunted pasts, the importance of food and other types of sustenance. The plot revolves around wacky personalities, old wounds, and unplanned events, and even though the characters frequently despair, the show ends on a hopeful note.As with most plays, it's better to watch Crimes of the Heart than to read it, but I admit that I laughed out loud when I read some of the scenes. Henley won a Pulitzer for her work in Crimes of the Heart, and I think it was well-deserved."
4,Understanding Women.,"CRIMES OF THE HEART tells the story of three sisters reuniting together after the youngest of the trio (Babe) shoots her husband and is on the verge of being sent to prison. The story takes place deep in the south in Hazlehurst, Mississippi.The writing in this play is superb. It captures the spirit of each of the young women splendidly. However, moving as the story is, it isn't quite poetical and thereby misses perfection.Nevertheless, CRIMES OF THE HEART is an enjoyable piece of theatre displaying the daffy complexity of women seen through the lives of three sisters."
4,This may be biased,"I wrote these poems the past few months (mainly Winter '04/Spring '05). Anyway, I think Lulu press did a great job printing it, according to my personal formatting. The poems are definitely unique, and exude some of my personality. I do not want to praise my book, I merely want to say I am very proud of it and it will surely help me to grow as a poet and writer. Hope you enjoy my words. Check back in the coming months for new content...The author, J.R"
5,wacon,I;m please with my bohts table 6x11 ans 8x11. which I get them on every corel bandle panter 11 and corel draw 4. very impressed and I thinking to go professional on painting art's and photograhy artist later. recomended. for a good carrier change.
5,You'll never use a traditional mouse again.,"If you do any precision/grind/detail/tedious work with graphic design, make your life easier and get a Wacom. I honestly don't know how I could turn out the work without it. It would take a LOT longer, and I wouldn't have a wrist left. Even when not using the pen, the mouse is wireless and never needs batteries. I can work with the pad in my lap, which is a more natural feel when using the pen. Worth every penny."
4,Love the screen mapping,"I use this to do my digital art, including my comic book 'The Waiting Room' (available for your kindle), and switched to the widescreen for more accurate mapping to my 24"" monitor. The usual quality of wacom tablets is there, although I found that the side buttons are too easy to brush across easily with my hand while doing digital painting. I ended up disabling the right hand buttons as a result. My one request is still that wacom would put out a wireless adapter for those of us with these wired tablets to compete with their new wireless tablets. I'd love not to be attached to my pc tower."
3,Generally good tablet could be quite a bit better,The tablet does a pretty good job. The problems I have with it is that there are very few buttons for you to set (even though there is space for way more) and the keys that are there are all blank so I don't (easily) know what they do! I wish the tablet was wireless so that I could put it on my lap or any where else without the constraints of the cord. I like how you can set up the buttons for the various applications under system preferences.
5,Fantastic product,"I use 2 monitors, each with 1600x1200 resolution and I have no problems with precision. It does take up quite a bit of desk real estate, but it's worth it. My only complaint is that the standard pen is a little small for my hands, but if you've got average sized hands, you should be OK."
5,GREAT FOR AN AMARUTE,"it comes with software (adobe elements 7) is what i gave away cuzz i got CS4 MS, and has CS4 Photoshop has alot more potential than E7.what else can i say, has very nice packaging, just youtube it and see the videos"
5,Great tablet,"It was everything we were hoping that it would be. It's not too big, not too small, and my wife loves it."
2,Great product -- bunk service,"Mine came with a major blemish --blemish in that thus far this is not a functional impairment-- the clear plastic casing was split open for two inches along the top of the tablet. I immediately contacted Wacomwho then claimed that this was a design flaw since the inception of theproduct, and they would not replace my tablet."
3,almost great,"tablet works great... unless you have an extended display (on a mac)... in which case it is challenging, to say the least... bit of software/driver work would make this into an awesome productactual drawing capabilities are fantastic"
3,Pleasant enough space opera,"Not Anderson's best, but certainly better than a lot of the drek out there, and way better than any of what is laughingly called sci-fi on TV these days. The Big Ideas are satisfactorily Big and Awesome, the sense of wonder is certainly there for the reader, but the characters are kind of underwhelming. The protagonist, Lissa, isn't a terribly compelling individual, and I kept wishing she'd just shut up a lot of the time. A shame, because normally I like strong women characters, but Lissa was too much of an expository device. Her romantic entanglements progress along predictable lines, with no surprises about how they turn out. The aliens are the best characters.I class this one as light reading for the beach or a cozy evening in front of the fire. Not particularly memorable, but fun enough overall and better than TV."
4,"Slick Idiot, an impressive follow up to KMFDM","Ex-KMFDM members En Esch and Gunter Schulz have created a new band that resembles KMFDM more than MDFMK did. Which in my opinion, is a very good thing. It sounds a lot like XTORT and ANGST, classic KMFDM. En Esch does most of the vocals except for women doing back-up, a few words from Gunter, and even some guy rapping. I wasn't too crazy about the rapping but the chorus of the song ( titled ""lazy"" ) saves it.I am extremely happy with this album and I find myself thinking that it's just another KMFDM record. Every song on this CD is awesome. If you like KMFDM, you will love Slick Idiot."
4,Awesome...KMFDM fans should buy this!!,"Any fan of KMFDM should get this, great stuff by former KMFDM members. It sounds a lot like the later records ""symbols"" and Adios but it still packs a punch. Very good live shows as well, makes you miss the days when these guys were with KMFDM."
5,Great music for a hermit like me,"My favorite songs are ""Forgive Me,"" ""Xcess,"" ""Make Me Believe,"" and ""It Won't Do."" I liked how they sounded spacey. Good music for staring out the window and watching the clouds."
2,Well they got the Idiot part right.,"How about naming this ""Cheesy: Redux"". The only thing consistent here is the guitar work by Schulz, although it tends to be quite repetitive. This album really sounds like a compilation of the most boring KMFDM songs set to a disco beat. En Esch shouldn't have been selling all of his equipment on Ebay. Putting it to work on this album may have changed this reviewer's opinion of DickNity.I'd say if you are an obsessive compulsive KMFDM collector you might want this in your collection, at least for an interesting coaster. Try Esch's work in Pigface for a true taste of his mildly stimulating talent. You know what would make DickNity better? ...Sascha Konietzko and Raymond Watts.If you were exceedingly bored this summer you may have caught the Slick Idiot tour and the resulting covers of ""Godlike"" and ""A Drug Against War"", by far the best KMFDM songs ever performed by a band other than KMFDM."
5,I'm blown away!!!!!,"Slick Idiot was founded by former KMFDM members Guenter Schulz and En Esch. You gotta check them out. This is like listening to KMFDM on crack or something, it's just super groovy... En Esch's vocals are really awesome too; he's got one of the baddest sounding voices in music (and I mean that in a good way). Guenter's guitar work is great as usuall, great bone-crunching riffs and inovative licks. I especially like the trashy female vocals on this album; they sound like something out of Thrill Kill Kult's ""Sexplosion""-- another plus in my book. Overall this is excellent. Don't expect to hear a clone of KMFDM, they're similar but not that similar: Slick Idiot kind of sounds like a cross between Thrill Kill Kult and KMFDM. That's just my opinion though... check them out for yourself it's definitely worth the money."
4,A fine record.,"Alot of people seem to point to Slick Idiot now as being the ""true KMFDM"" after the classic line up of the band split up. While all of that is debateable(I can't decide myself), I do enjoy Slick Idiot more then I enjoy most of the albums that have been put out by the current line up of KMFDM, their ""attak"" album being to possible exception, although I'd wager that Raymond Watt's presense on that disc did alot for it.Slick Idiot seems to have picked up on alot of the personality in the music that was missing in alot of the new KMFDM. Although alot of the songs run together, there is alot less filler then you would see with their counterparts these days.A good record altogether, a must however for fans of KMFDM/PIG, or industrial rock in general."
3,"Good theme album, listen to it occationally.","Kraftwerk tries to build a theme or a musical journey (if you may) into their CDs. Here, in radio activity, they try again. The music is very unique and original. Yet I cannot give it a 5-star because of my personal taste for more upbeat music from them. If you listen to the samplers that Amazon puts on the website, you will see that the music is not for dancing and not upbeat. There is some trance mood, but this ablum is very electronic ""background"" music. Not sure if you too can listen to the songs every day, and continue to get a ""jolt"" from it, like THE MIX.Try THE MIX first. Then, work your way back to this CD, after getting the classic AUTOBAHN cd. I got hooked on the AUTOBAHN as the premiere journey CD."
1,genius of a child prodigy,"After listening to this album, it inspired me to get on the keyboard. I can write and play this music, and I've never taken a piano lesson in my life. My daughter could probably play the same caliber music, and she is not even three. I know Kraftwerk is more talented than this. RADIO-ACTIVITY sans the sound effects show little imagination and creativity. The normal and synthesized vocals go great with the music, since they were both subpar. This album doesn't hold a candlestick to AUTOBAHN, or T.E.E. If you are buying Kraftwerk for the first time, don't start with this album."
1,Spend Your Money Wisely,"Kraftwerk are commonly thought of as the godfathers of electronic music, and they have inspired many excellent groups like Orbital to create fantastic music. But here's a tip, buy Orbital's album instead, or any modern album for that fact. This Cd was a total waste of my money. What you get for your money are 12 songs so basic i could have composed them on my phone, only about 8 of them are actual songs, and none of them are interesting or musical in the slightest. I can see why people respect Kraftwerk, Oh Wait.... NO i can't. Do not buy this album to listen to it should only be bought as an antique."
4,The beginnings of quality electronic music,"Made in 1975 so even by Kraftwerk's standards this is very primitive sounding due to the fact that electronic equipment like keyboards and synths were only starting to be developed.Nevertheless this is an album full of sweet melodies and clicking electronic drums and percussion. It has a darker feel than later albums, partly due to the albums subject matter, the threat of Radiation.Some songs are very experimental but mostly they are very melodic and highly enjoyable tracks like 'Antenna' with its early bassline being a highlight and the dual language vocal on title track 'Radioactivity'.Not advisable for an introduction to Kraftwerk, purchase 'Computer World' or 'Man Machine' first to get used to their sound."
5,Critics go to Hell.,"Upon reading the ""critic's"" summation of this sublime album, I ask one question? Who the hell are these people? The radio bleeps and noise are NOT filler by any means! This album is a symphony of movements, a progression of ideas and analogies of physical energy to human emotions. ""The voice of energy"", in all its simplicity and iciness, is a heart felt proclamation that it is energy in its purest form, that gives us both music and the power to destroy ourselves. The melodies are hauntingly eerie and beatiful, and the integration of the static and the geiger counter only heighten the anticipation. Only narrow-minded people who look at pop albums as a cliche'd list of non-related songs complete with conventional beats, vocals and endings would consider the ""movements"" on Radio-Activity ""filler"". What nonsense. This album is cinematic music in its utmost form."
4,A changing werk,"I like this record a lot, it just has a couple of things that bother me. Listening fromTone Float + 1organisation up to radio-activity,this to me is where the switch fully takes place from the trippy weird proggishnish to the streamlined killers they are now. The things that bother me are 1. Intermission 2.News, I wish these we're more fully explored sonically, and 3. Radio Stars is one of the only Kraftwerk songs I will skip on an album, kind of just annoying to me. Sorry I love'em but just not this tune. If one is collecting the werk the best way to do it is the 2009 box setThe Catalogue, it rules sonically over the older cds. The first three especially. Now if they would just remaster the first four.............."
5,under rated masterpiece,"When I first bought this album in 1976, it literally changed how I would ever look at music again. Previously, music consisted of radio, pop hit's and Bandstand. Then I heard Radio-Activity. It was like nothing I had ever heard before. Listening to it again, 33 years later I am dumbstruck at how fresh this still sounds. The opening three tracks leave you with a feeling of reverence, liturgical music for the machine age. And although this could have just as easily been made today, the influence on everything from Goth, industrial, noize, ambient and so on is readily apparent. This is Kraftwerks masterpiece."
2,travail,"à part le single donnant son titre à l'albulm, les autres singles ne sont pas aboutis, il manque du travail. de plus la nouveauté de l'époque n'a pas passé l'épreuve du temps."
5,Must have!,"This is great book that you must have somewhere around when you are writing some code. But I must say that this book is, in some way, Introduction to Donald Knuth's books: Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science (Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science (2nd Edition)) and The art of computer Programming (The Art of Computer Programming, Volumes 1-4A Boxed Set (Box Set)).In any way, buy this book, it is worth every penny and something you must read if you are CS student or you have interest in programming and math."
5,Super Book,"They don't make them like this anymore. Amid the ""Learning XXX in 21 days"" and various other computer book for which depth is almost non existent (and are read like eating peanuts), this is a refreshing book that talks about solutions to sometimes common (IMHO) coding problems.If you enjoy programming gems, or remember that beyond your C code there is a machine that executes your program, this is the book for you. For example, think how would you count the 1 bits in a 32 bit integer - the book has an elegant solution in log(n). Aside from this, the book has about 50 or so problems, with their solutions (and proof).Bottom line: fine book, worthy to be near my Knoth, R&K; and Stroustrup books."
5,In your face,"Cleans without the usual dry and starched feeling.Light and very clean, got one for myself and one for my daughter and we are both very pleased with the soap, will put it on our perminant must have list."
1,Very Irritating!,"The soap was very irritating to my skin, it made my skin itch & break out, it made my skin very dry, I have combination skin,and thought to give this soap a Try, I will not purchase again! for my skin there was no benefits!"
3,A must have if you collect on Marky Mark Wahlberg,"In 1993, Marky Mark Wahlberg was a child with a man's body. This issue proves it as the list of his hottest moments are stuff like, ""my first orgasm"" and ""when I first saw a woman naked"". I know this is a porn mag, but his answers sound like something a 13-year-old boy would say. The pictures of him in this issue were taken by Lynn Goldsmith. The same photog who wrote the book ""Marky Mark"". As always, her pics are wonderful and this magazine is no exception.I only bought this mag to add to my Marky collection. I didn't even bother looking at the rest of this."
2,Disappointed,"Read all the reviews, so I ordered 3 videos from Mei Mei, including this one, 5 videos from Panda Pim, and 1 video from follow Jade. My 2 yr old daughter, who doesn't speak chinese, loves the Panda videos by far. They are the most fun and informative, integrating much more chinese language in a easy to follow format. The first video from Mei Mei is her favorite (yellow cover) out of the 3 I got. This one is rather boring. Follow Jade was too simple and easily covered by Panda Pim."
2,weak phone/answerer,We purchased this phone/answerer and an expansion handset and returned them because it did not work well and we were disappointed. The answering machine sounded very poor with a tinny sound that distorted the voices. The speaker on the base is small and the voices sound un-natural. Our recorded outgoing announcement sounded weak and cheap. The phone had an echo periodically which the callers on the other end of the line did not hear but was annoying to us using the phone. The only positive was the speaker phone on the handset which did sound good. I would not recommend this phone/answerer to anyone.
5,Love through the ages,"Diane Wolkstein is a consumate storyteller. I only wish I could hear her read/tell these stories aloud. In this book, she brings to life lovers who have been gone for millennia! The Song of Songs has never sounded so alive and passionate. You search with Isis and pine with Iseult. Read these stories, then do yourself the favor of reading them out loud (to yourself or to anyone who'll listen)"
4,"Great product, but flimsy case","I have owned an Apple Newton 100, a Compaq C-140, a Uniden UniPro 100A, a Philips Nino 312, a Philips Nino 510, an HP Jornada 430se, an HP Jornada 545, and now the Compaq. The Compaq is one of the best devices yet. The new OS is great, but I would like to see a faster processor in the device. It is sluggish at times. I have heard runors that Compaq may be discontinuing the Aero line and replacing it with the higher priced monochrome iPaq currently being sold in other countries. The iPaq has many serious problems in the color version, such as the screen image being reversed and flipped in different directions, and many other problems. DON'T DISCONTINUE THE AERO COMPAQ."
1,It's not the best pocket pc out there.,"I have just recently purchased an Aero 1550 and although it has a good price and plenty of memory it lacks things like ""syncing"" capabilities from desktop to pocket pc. It does however come with and attractive slipcover and a convenient recharging cradle and ""syncing"" cradle all in one. And (a bonus and probably one star worth) the software that comes with it is exceptional. However the small size which to some might be convenient; to me it feels almost to light and to small but it fits anywhere you would like to place it (which is a plus for this product). Overall I would recommend something like a Palm III series or a Handspring Visor because for the everyday hectic life style it might leave something to desire.-Jose Nunez"
4,Excited to receive my Compaq Aero 1550 PPC,"I have been using the Cassiopeia E-11 for two years now and I have been nothing but satisfied with it. But, this device blows it away, hands down. The selling points were: Excel, Word, etc. And the ability to sync with my desktop computer has always been a plus for me. I am a Office Administrator (that's right folks a male secretary) at Boeing in Everett, WA. I have to have loads of information, for my boss, at my fingertips. This device has made me a hero. To have the answer when he wants and needs it is very attractive to me in my position. I love the idea of being able to keep all my contacts or data handy. So, if you are vaselating on whether to purchase this item, then I would strongly suggest that you give this item a serious look. Happy Computing."
1,disappointment,"At first it was amazing. It simply locked up and wouldn't turn off. Had to take out battery to initialize, then one day that didn't work. Sent in for warranty service. Got it back and a couple of weeks later the screen cracked with light use of the stylus. Sent it back for warranty repair. They refused claiming a cracked screen was sign of abuse, period. Never got it serviced, never got my money back, they treated me like I was trying to [cheat] them. A total waste of money and worse than that the 12 people who bought it on my recommendation probably had similar experiences. Compaq/HP customer support are you out there?"
5,Best thing since sliced bread,"Since I bought the Aero 1550 Pocket PC, it has changed the way that I do business. It connects to my desktop and it checks my e-mail and task list. Updates and add these new tasks to keep me up to date. One of the best time management tools there is. I can take Word documents with me and make changes. I also put my Excel spreadsheets on the Pocket PC and I can edit or make changes to them. Perfect while I am traveling. Has kept me exactly where I need to be, and on time for those appointments. The microphone allows me to keep those quick notes and the translator allows me to write and it transcribes what I wrote. The verson of microsoft money helps me track my business expenses. Microsoft reader allows me to read books without having to carry those bulky books along. Kind of looks like something out of a Science Fiction movie."
2,Watch out for the warranty!,"I have to agree with the 'Awful Warranty' comments below. I had my Aero in my front pocket all day and sometime during the day my screen broke. Compaq also quoted me $185 to have it repaired. If only I had seen the other review before purchasing this! Other companies like Handspring replace a PDA screen for free the first time it's damaged. Overall, it's a great product combined with a disgraceful warranty. Beware!"
2,"Great Functionality, Still has Microsoft problems","I purchased my Compaq a bit more than three months ago and for the first two months I loved it. I used it everyday, finding the Compaq to be a powerful tool. Unfortunately my machine has developed a few significant bugs over the past two weeks. First, my 'Today' screen (overview of appointments and to do's) began to only paritally appear. It brings up the top banner and does not refresh the bottom half of the screen. Now my unit is 'stuck' on the password screen and I can't do anything with it.This would be a great tool if Microsoft could get its act together."
2,Awful Warranty,"i used to own a compaq 1530. not a bad pda, but with such a flimsy case to protect it, the glass cracked. from looking at the cracks, it did not receive a major blow to cause the cracks. anyways, i tried using the warranty and was willing to pay money to get it fixed until i found out that it would COST $185 dollars to do any fixing that isn't covered under warranty. the thing only costs a little more! i think it is just ridiculous. i mean, maybe 50-100 dollars is reasonable, but almost 200 is just way too much. well, i learned my lesson not to buy from compaq anymore"
3,a mildly entertaining book to read in an afternoon,"I read this book in one afternoon and afterward I felt as if I had consumed a big bowl of popcorn - full but not very satisfied. Character development was thin, especially in the case of Eleanor."
3,"Mildly entertaining, but predictable","Bought this book to read on a plane trip. It was entertaining enough, but somewhat predictable. Ephron was trying to write in the style of Wharton or James and sometimes succeeded in the ""feel"", although it was filled with odd grammatical errors. I agree with other reviewers that this was a short story that happened to run long."
2,A weak cup of tea,"The premise of this story was full of wonderful possibilites, so I was disappointed that it was so predictable. I believe that the reference to a Katherine Mansfield story for inspiration will be the iniative for many readers to search out the works of this great author and enjoy some inspiring literature.It is a short, easy read, but not very satisifying - rather like a weak cup of tea."
2,Disappointing Victorian Drama,"I was looking forward to something Victorian which I thought would be fun to read and fairly easy to carry with me (even tho I had the hardbound edition). In the first chapter of this drab tale I immediately found a discrepancy. First she examines a small enamel box at the antique shop and then two pages later or whatever it was he wraps up a procelain box for her.I found Rose EXTREMELY irritating right from the start and I wondered ""why am I reading this"". Infact, I stuck it out and found at the end that the only person I felt sorry for was, now what was his name????? Anyway, the guy who Eleanor and Rose are interested in. I think he was extremely DUMB to go ahead with the wedding and when he finally came out of the trenches he should have packed his bag when she was indisposed and left. My personal feeling is that Rose was ticked off when he was MIA because it made her look bad."
5,Delightful,"A Cup of Tea is a wonderful short novel. I read the book in one setting, touched by all the characters and unable to be biased for one over the other. Thought it was an interesting idea to explore how performing a good deed could go against you. Looking forward to more from Amy Ephron!"
1,Trite story poorly written and edited,"This was profoundly disappointing. The premise is hackneyed, the story is predictable, and the ending is almostlaughably melodramatic. While it's a quick read (because many of the chapters are two pages long or less, as if each werewritten in a hurry), it still felt like a waste of time. It isn't even up to the standards of cheap romance novels; at leastthose strive to be entertaining. This book seems listless, as if the author was so bored by her own characters that she justwanted to get the story written as quickly as possible. Presumably the editor was in a hurry, too; the text has the sloppiestediting I've ever come across. The usage and grammar are awkward (a character ""sort of vaguely"" makes a gesture); the punctuation is annoyingly haphazard. If neither the author nor the editor care enough to put a minimal amount of effort intothe book, you shouldn't put any effort into reading it, either."
1,Ugh,"I couldn't wait to finish this book only because it was so dreadful and I always finish what I start. The characters and plotline were simplistic and not realistic. It totally lost me during the chapter which begins with Philip in his carriage without a driver, but the driver mysteriously appears two paragraphs later. Magical??? Not. Don't waste your time or money."
3,Interesting little book,"I enjoyed this quick read. It reminded me, in theme, of ""Howard's End"" and little of ""The Great Gatsby"". While it is a little book I think it is thought provoking all the same."
2,simple and predictable,A easy to read short story. It is sweet and very predictable. Do not bother unless you want something very light.
1,"Book lite - fewer words, less filling","It had a beginning, a middle, and an end. I've read comic books that were more interesting. The author provided little attention to detail re: character development and period detail. Why was this book published? Could it be because her last name is Ephron?"
1,A Cup of Tea,"Phew. I wonder how these books get published?? The only good thing about this book is what Amy Ephron has copied from Mansfield. The story is bland and ends so flatly. I wonder if the author ran out of patience. All through, she tries to make us feel us sorry for Eleanor, but fails miserably. Her characterization is vapid, and the book is more diaphanous than a Helium balloon.Poor Ms. Mansfield, if she had seen what she inspired..."
2,not worth the time,This was a big disappointment--the author failed to develop what could have been a great premise. The characters were one-dimensional and I really didn't like any of them. There were also glaring historical errors that I couldn't ignore.
2,A Cup of Simple Plots With an Anticlimatic Ending,I bought this book after I read the summary on the back. The summary led me to believe that this would be a compelling book about the early 20th century. The book was interesting for about ten pages and after that was fluff. I got nothing out of this book.
4,A great read for a rainy afternoon.,A cup of tea is a delightful book that draws you into the complex relationship between a high society socialite and beautiful but lonely and poor woman she finds on the street. Amy Ephron's style expertly clips along and allows the reader into the posh world of New York as the country enters World War One. The romance of characters is must read for an afternoon by a window on a rainy day with nothing but a cup of tea and an imagination.
3,A good read for a summer's day.,"Although the characters in the book lacked depth, I found the story enjoyable. The story didn't need to be set in any particular time or place; the eternal triangle always goes well with a cup of tea on a summer's day. Tea lover from New Jersey"
3,A Decent Quick Read,"Let me put it this way. A Cup of Tea was entertaining. Women were sure dumb in those days though. ""I'm here! Walk all over me!!!"""
2,VERY disappointing -- AWFUL book,"The reason for 2 stars (instead of NEGATIVE 2!, which is basically what it deserves) is because it WAS a page-turner for me (although at one point, I had predicted the ending!)This book was a quick read (which I like), but the ending was terrible. I think this woman was hoping this book would be made into a cheesy tv mini-series. How it got published is beyond me (but a good guess would be because of her sister's connections).I had read ""One Sunday Morning"" before this, and although the ending of that one was a major disappointment as well, this book has turned me off to reading any more of her books.Waste of time for me. (which is very irritating because I'm not a big reader! AND there are other books on my To Read list I could have been enjoying instead!)"
1,"If Ephoron can publish, SO CAN I!","very POORLY written book, sentences flow awkwardly. besides the history being inaccurate, somehow modern slang is incorporated in the dialgoues. [INCOMPLETE RESEARCH]. i regret paying $ for this book. don't believe the book's description, it is not a JEWEL and i am wondering was it really a national bestseller? i will start worrying about the nation's IQ if it is. the plot was decent, but it wasn't developed, the characters were one dimensional and very little was told about them..everything that could possibly happen took place in the book- murder, molestation, war, love, lesbianism, rags-to-riches, fashion, homelessness, single parentage, unmarried pregnancy, adultery, affairs..not as bizzare as taking place in that order though..but close enough.."
2,Not the worst thing you'll ever read,"but far from the best. Her grammar is awful; many details of the period are simply wrong; the colloquialisms (Philip tells Eleanor he's having ""flashbacks"") and manners far too modern (respectable women did not enter bars alone in 1917; Ephron has Eleanor going to a bar by herself and downing a whiskey and soda) and even the few tidbits she provides about New York are inaccurate (Dora's is on Sutter Street --- there is no such street in NY; in 1917 the theatre district was on 14th Street, not in the 40's the way it is today). Yes, I know it isn't history, but this is just sloppy writing. A Cup of Tea might be a good read for a train or a plane; it's fast, and if you leave it behind on your seat, you'll never miss it."
3,A Nice Quick Read,"This is book #2 on my Randomly Picked From The Library Reviews.Many of the reviews of this book have a huge flaw. Apparently people pick up novels expecting Emily Dickinson and are disappointed when Amy Ephron shows up. The beauty of genius is that it is rare. Do not expect genius, hope for genius.Now for my review of the book: It was overall a very decent read. Definitely a great book for someone who is not yet reading historical fiction and you think will enjoy them. Sure, the book had a few flaws, but overall it was very decent.My one issue was the chapter set-up. I believe the longest chapter in the book was four pages long, which just seemed silly as I was reading the book. It is 200 pages long, but if condensed into normal chapters would have been lucky to hit 150 pages.Overall, a decent rewrite of the Katherine Mansfield short story. I'd recommend it for anyone looking for a quick read or who wants to dabble in the historical fiction genre."
4,do you like your tea strong?,"don't let the number of pages fool you. this little book has some meat on its bones. the strengh of this books comes with its characters. i found myself thnking about them and wondering how i would react in such situations. my book club had a great discussion about true motives, dishonesty and appearances. this book will make you think; always a good thing."
1,A Cup of Tea,"I would give this book a minus 5.A CUP OF TEA is trite, predictable, unoriginal, and amatuerish in every way possible. And I thought THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY was bad!"
1,Not very good...,"First, this is hardly a ""period piece"" as there are only a few mentions of the war and fashion of the era. Otherwise, this could very well be the tale of a home wrecker in the 21st century. I finished this ""book"" in less than an hour, so its brevity is really its only redeeming quality. In a nutshell, a well-to-do woman brings home a beautiful, but penniless, woman to give her some food. Not surprisingly, in one glance the husband to be is lovestruck by this new woman. From there the book drags on with unfelt tension as two lovebirds we don't care about play at their deception.I note that this book comes with a ""reading group discussion"" section at its conclusion. In my opinion, any book that requires instruction about good points to talk about is not a book that is very good. A book worth reading will have readers talking about it without a list of recommended topics.On that point, I will end my discussion here.Relic113"
2,A Cup of Tea,"I was looking forward to reading this book because of the historical setting. I was sorely disappointed at the lack of character development. At the end of the book (and the whole time I was reading it, for that matter) I did not care about the people I had just read about. I felt as if I was ready about stick people with no ""meat"" to their characters. It's too bad because the premise for the book was intriguing. Many plot elements were too contrived and predictable. I would not recommend this book to my book-loving friends. Good thing I paid a small price for it at a used bookstore."
5,A perfect find,"The book was gently used and arrived in very good condition. The dust jacket had a little wear which is to be expected. Overall, the book was everything that I expected to be, and it arrived in a timely manner.About the novel ... NYC in the early 1900's is always interesting reading, and this was the perfect find. I love the title name, and the cover illustration depicts the time. The story characters are real as is the dialogue. The chapters are short, but intriguing, and will keep the reading coming back for more until the end."
3,Was hoping for better...,"I didn't like any of the characters. There were multiple mistakes in the story (where are the editors?). BUT it is a quick read and a glimpse into many lives that never get the ""happily ever after."""
3,Entertaining but Empty,"Perhaps it is merely Ms. Ephron's style of writing, but A Cup of Teaseemed to die before it had begun. The story's plot could haveunfolded into a wonderful novel, it has all the characteristics of abeautiful love story, and I did admire the way that it seemed to sidewith no one; however, I felt that it was underdeveloped. Just as weare beginning to get to know the characters the book is over.Thinkwhat the author could have done if she had explored more indepthlywhat it was like to be Jane? A homosexual woman living in such anera, in such a part of society where it would be so unacceptable.Orperhaps Phillip. Did he really love these two women?...Entertaining, but empty."
2,loved the plot...hated the ending!!!!,"the story itself was easy to get into and very quick to read...i was very disapointed in the ending, i thought it ended like a bad play with a sudden twist. it left you feeling very hanging and wasted for reading the book."
1,"Better make it ""A Cup of Coffee""","You'll need the caffeine to keep you awake through this thoroughly disappointing little book. The number one problem with this novel is a predictable plot. Almost from the moment it began, I wondered how many b&w movies I've watched with a similar tired theme. I think the only thing that changes is the time frame within which this same story is retold: Victorian England, WWI, WWII,... It doesn't matter. The only reason I bothered to finish the book is that I kept hoping the ending would be different. It wasn't. Save your money and don't buy this book!"
4,An early 1900s touching love story.,"A Cup Of Tea takes place in the early 1900s in a town of wealth and power along with a few strugglers. When a simple act of kindness turns sour, a young women realizes not to take the things she once had for granted."
1,Boring!,"The author is terrible at character building and gloats in boring but glowing terms about all her perfect acquaintances. Her highlights are worrying about companions possibly snoring which she still writes in boring terms. I can read a book in a day and do so all the time. After page 50, I thought send her back to writers school. BORING! Book going to Good Will."
4,Whoracle,"First off, I want to say that In Flames is the band the got me into the metal scene. Hailing from Sweden, In Flames really kicked me in the ass with this album. At first I thought they had outdone the Jester Race, but after a few listens and long hard thinking I decided no :) The first song, Jotun, kicks off whoracle with an absolutly beautiful riff. I still feel like I could keep it on repeat. Its one of those songs where you get butterflies in your stomach because thats how good it is. The whole album is like this. No bad songs here. This is true metal. If you liked the jester race, colony, or clayman you will like this album just as much. This cd came before in flames started to mellow out...their still good mind you..just different.Best Songs: Jotun and WhoracleOne Word Review: Beautiful"
5,INCREDIBLE,"This is not the best In Flames CD but it is a very good album. There is a lot of classic on this album such as ""Jotun"", ""Episode 666"" and ""Whoracle"" the song. All songs are great and this album is intensely melodic as all In Flame songs are. In Flames are the gods of melodic death metal and it is albums like this one that prove it. The best In Flames album in my book is THE JESTER RACE though. Still, buy this album."
4,An album that counts...,"Sweden's In Flames will soon be a force to be reckoned with.Their 1997 sophomore full-length is a mind-bending mixture of death,traditional metal,Scandinavian folk influences,all give an ultra-modern spin,with taste and sophistication."
5,black metal,why is everyone saying that inflames are death metal.they are black metal.if you whant to here death go listen to cannibal corpse or morbid angel.in flames are a black metal band and a bloody good one at that
4,another great album from ssweed metal masters,"to 5 stars would eb kinda cliche, as everyone seems to give 5 stars to anything and everything out there. awesome band; swedish metal is great. intricate guitar work and above average vocals; what more could u ask for?"
3,not IF's best...,"I love In Flames, but Whoracle (despite the great title) just seems to be lacking in comparison to albums like Jester Race, Clayman, and Colony. Part of it is the vocals, as Anders puts in his worst performance ever on the microphone. The music is good, but not really up-to-par with other material from the band. However, it's still worth having in your collection."
2,Real metal treat if you like growly vocals,"Listening to this album I am torn two ways. Musically I love itand yet I can't enjoy it because I really hate the vocals. So if you like Gamma Ray, Stratovarius, Helloween and the like( as I do) you may or may not like this albumdepending on whether you have the stomach for the kind of vocals that sound like they are being belched down the lavatory.I don't."
2,poop!,"this band is so lame!really boring melodic death garbage that is so f-----g boring!!no memorable riffs and they are so pathetic they even include a depeche mode cover on their album,you losers!listen to quality death metal e.g-immolation,nilegoodbye."
3,Great but rather limited.,"As a big fan of the original Axis and Allies game I couldn't wait to get my hands on this new version. The game has some great new additions such as artillery and destroyers. The nation-specific pieces are great as well. Unfortunately the game suffers from a major gameplay issue which is that a major clash (tons of dice) between the USSR and Germany will decide the outcome every time. Thus, the game alway plays the same way, with the USA and UK players having a rather boring time of it. Still fun - just a bit repetitave. Best for 2 players."
5,Dear Lord...,"This CD is nothing short of amazing. Dimmu Borgir has quickly become one of my favorite bands. The songs on this disc are incredible. The musicianship is top notch. I am not into the whole satan thing, and it gets a little old after a while, but do not let that scare you away. The highlights on this CD are: ""Mourning Palace"",""Spellbound"",""In Death's Embrace"" and ""Master Of Disharmony"". HAIL DIMMU BORGIR!!"
5,One of the top metal masterpieces of all time!,"This review is more for those who have never listened to this album rather than long-time Dimmu fans. Dimmu fans rave about this album for a reason. This is not only a black metal masterpiece in its own right, but one of the best metal albums ever created. Heavy, brooding, dark, and haunting are only a few adjectives that can be used to describe this album. This is THE album that brought black metal to the masses and probably (arguably) propelled Dimmu to their current stature amongst the giants of metal. I think this album is a great buy for someone trying to discover black metal and a no-brainer for someone who is already a black metal fan. This is a must-own, black metal masterpiece!"
5,Better Than Cradle's Dusk and her Embrace,"This album is Dimmu Borgir's best black metal album. I did not like Black Dimensions all that well. The first song, Mourning palace bores after the first two minutes. Go on to Spellbound and this is the 2nd best song on the cd. It doesn't drag out, and has awesome riffs. The 3rd song, In death's embrace, is the most orchaestrated song on the album, the most melodic and best sounding of all the songs of the album, albeit with satanic, yet still silly, lyrics. This is probably one of the, if not the, most evil black metal album on the market. I highly recommend this to an open minded person but not a person who is offended by this kind of lyrics"
2,Not impressed,"I'm not much of a black metal listener, so i don't know of many bands to compare this with, but this album has to be completely overrated. Must admit the first 3 songs are great, but if only the rest of the album could have been as consistent then this could have lived up to the hype. I guess i'm a bit spoiled since I started listening to this genre through Emperor. I'm still trying to find an album in the same league as nightside eclipse, but i guess i never will. I'll just collect all Emperor cd's and dismiss the rest as garbage."
3,To Much Symphony,I love Dimmu Borgir and this is my least favorite album by them. The albums before this (Stormblast and For All Tid) were nearly flawless in the terms of raw black metal albums. The symphonic elements of this album stand out too much for my liking. There are some great songs on this but i'll choose to listen to other releases by them over this. I have to be in the mood to listen to this album.
4,"A great CD, but not for softies","I listened to 'Enthrone Darkness' and i think this CD is the best Dimmu CD so far! It's pretty loud, but sometimes it sounds a bit the same. But still, it's a great band with wonderful keyboards and vocals. Especially 'Mourning palace' and the hidden track ( i thought it was called 'Raabjorn speller') are beautiful songs with feeling, although the singer isn't a Peter Gabriel or a Neil Diamond...thank god! For me the Dimmu Borgir singer is absolutely the best male in the black metal scene! Hail Satan, Zaydir and don't forget their home-based-band from hell!"
2,"too noisy, no particular guitar talent","There's not enough musical talent in this group.It seems the vocals have a surronding treatment and it's so dark you may think it's a joke. Imagine someone who has never listened to dark metal listening to this. He'd just laugh at you and would give you back the CD saying ""I'm very sorry for you if you listen to this"". But that wouldn't be the case if there were good musical stuff to be heard : some guitar solos for example. But there are only synthesisers. And the vocals are just the same from begin to end, which make the songs almost unrecognizable."
5,Dimmu Borgir's best album!,"In 1997 Dimmu Borgir released their third and best album ""Enthrone Darkness Triumphant"". This is the album where everything came together and started working for this band. This was their major label debut (they weren't mainstream by any means though) and the first album to have lyrics in English rather than Norweigen like their first two albums. Don't get me wrong, I liked their debut ""For All Tid"" although I was disappointed with their sophomore album ""Stormblast"". To have the lyrics in English was a good thing in my opinion. Also the production quality is actually good this time and that was the best improvement on this album because their first two albums had terrible production quality. The musicianship is also awesome. I really don't have a favorite song on this album yet though. I think I'll take ""In Death's Embrace"" as my favorite Dimmu Borgir song. Great stuff!"
1,These guys are such dorks.,"My banner headline says it all. The name of the album doesn't even make any sense. If you don't believe me, just listen to the ridiculous keyboard and organ effects on ""Spellbound (by the devil)"", as well as all the other tracks for comic relief. You'll find that to be their only merit."
1,Dummy Burger...,"UGH! These guys are exactly like CoF and Wimperor, their ONLY here to annoy! The keybpards are extremely cheesy, and the whole piano/synth thing is totally wimpy, I can't believe that people actually like when bands incorprate these things in the music, especially when they are overused, I guess It's ok if it's only for a little while, but NOT when they over do it like Dummy BUrger. Black metal is guitars & Hatred, not stupid cartoon jingles! Bands like this is what gives BM a bad name... Dimmu, care nothing for ideoolgy, they're only doing this to feed their rock-star egos! Commercialism has NO place in the realm of black MetaL! Go & listen to Thornspawn & Blood Storm, or some Impiety! That's all for now, thank You!"
3,Pop Black Metal,"This is black metal for people who don't listen to black metal. In comparison to real black metal, this is like listening to RHCP or Green Day. Holds more depth than most music of today, but not nearly as much as other death metal. It's dangerously close to Cradle of Filth (crap)."
5,Still great...,"Enthrone Darkness Triumphant stands as one of Dimmu Borgir's best releases. Their first album in English, and was it amazing!This, to me, is the essential Dimmu Borgir, with Mourning Palace and In Death's Embrace (possibly my favorite Dimmu song, ever.), this release should be the first you buy by this amazing band."
3,"Slow start, but interesting","This book is most appropriate for anyone who believes in US government conspiracies. The inability of the FBI to catch a spy who seemed to put out crazy person vibes for years is a bit scary. Robert Hanssen was one strange cat. Maybe he was smart, but he didn't come across as too smart in this book. It is no shocker that a guy who claimed to take religion and family values seriously ends up as a huge hypocrite. The book gets more interesting towards the end. Sad story."
4,Spy Lover,"After watching the movie Breach, I decided to check out this book. It's very comprehensive and easy to follow for myself and fellow novices to this subject. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
1,Not For Programmers,"When I obtained this book, I would looking for some in the trenches guidence on how to code web services using Apache Axis. The table of contents suggested that this might be an appropriate book for my needs.I should have read the Amazon reviews first. This is not a programmers guide, but a guide for architects and managers.This was a huge disappointment for me."
1,No relevance to J2EE or JWSDP - Save your Money,"If you are Java developer, don't get carried away by this book title. This book has no conceptual relevance to j2ee or jwsdp. The book is also poorly written and the code examples are completely not usable at anyform. I did a big mistake picking this title."
2,atrocious code,"Have a look at the code snippet on pages 138-139. It's terrible. I've let go of a couple of coders over the years on the basis of their poor coding practices, and this reminds me of their stuff. Yeah, I know... the thrust of the book is big-picture high-level architecture, so nit-picking on coding style may be missing the point, but in the design and architecture area as well, I'm seeing impressive-looking diagrams and hifalutin claims of superior insights that, on closer examination, reveal a disorganized and indiscrimate jumble. Right now, I'm inclined to return the book. This book might impress your managers, but it shouldn't impress you."
4,You might want to consider ordering this book from amazon uk i did,This book ends one of the best series i have ever read. In my own personal opinion various parts and sections of the books cn stand head to head with any of the greats. To this day I still remember parts very distinctively and marvel at the authors imagination.This particular book is not the stronget in the group and i purchased it because it was the concluding one.Misfit has done a good review above and describes it well.
5,Great!,"It's a webkinz, what can I say? Bought this for our daughter who quasi-collects webkinz. Great little fellow! Our family is a webkinz kind of family."
2,A Little Disappointed,"I was a little disappointed when this little bunny arrived. I expected it to be smaller and the ears were smashed back. I could not get them to face forward like the photo, which makes the bunny cuter. Otherwise, it is very soft, cute and a great Easter basket addition!"
4,MY KIDS LOVE IT!,"My 6 years old love it! small very nice, she goes to sleep with this toy every night..."
4,Good Buy,I've had webkinz pets for a long time. I like this one because it's cute online and in real life. As far as being a good product it's really nice. My friend and I play animal shelter with it and my collection. Overall it's a really good buy.
5,Inspiring and Informative,"After reading this book I'm running every day, really paying attention to what I'm doing while running and what my body is telling me, feeling stronger, getting stronger, and loving it. Thoughout my life I have run inconsistently, mostly as a chore to get in shape, preferring to bicycle when ever I wanted to engage long distance, aerobic efforts. Running always hurt too much in comparison to cycling. After reading this book my strengths, physical and mental, have come forward, and I run with a great deal more ease and enjoyment. But that's only half of it. Bern is a very high class story teller too. Very enjoyable book all the way around."
4,Distance Running,This was a thoughtful venture into the science of distance running. The authors presents us with this scientific material (the physiology of endurance running) in a digestable manner. His prose is excellent for a scientist.
1,A Cautionary Tale,"I got this book thinking it was that other book about chasing antelopes. The one by that other guy. The good one. Which, as that other reviewer tells me (too late), is called Running After Antelope. This one is not good like that one. That one, the Scott Carrier one, is really really good. It's heartbreaking and smart in this sneaky way where it's not all flashy and show-off-y, but you find that Scott Carrier's thoughts become the ones you think for days and days. And then you realize that these are not thoughts you invented. They're his. But they feel nice in your head.Let this serve as a warning to anyone who might be duped into buying this book thinking it's that other one, because it is not."
5,my 2 year old knows it by heart,"My 2.5 year old can recite the entire book after just 2 weeks of having it on loan from the library (and reading it many times per his request). Thanks to the book he knows his planets (tested independently on an ipad app showing the solar system), since the martians visit each planet in turn. It's a book with humor and so much heart. It's perfect, just wish it wasn't out of print."
1,Useless,Totally useless. Ca't understand what the publisher was thinking. I have read the book in both german and english. There was m effort to print the book the way a german book's language appears in the usual printed german editions. Basically unreadable.
2,muscles for golf,this book goes counter to what most golf experts say. it seems to promote bulking up. bigger muscles do not translate into hitting the ball farther. the opposite is usually true.
4,HAMMERMILL FORE MP PAPER,"I bought this paper from amazon.com for more money, but as I was reading the description it shows a case & the price of $68. (amazon price) for one ream of paper! I emailed Amazon, and the person in India or wherever verified it was for one ream. The shipping weight was 60lbs.! Well, when it arrived today, it did weigh 60 lbs, because there were 10 reams! Amazon, have someone in your warehouse verify next time..Thats why this is a 4 star."
2,Would not recommend,This paper came poorly packaged and the box was bursting at the seams. When I opened it the packaging on each and every pack of paper was torn open.
1,Damaged Paper,"The reams of paper arrived in a box that was broken in several parts although still intact. When I opened the box, the reams of paper were also broken open. Quite unsatisfactory."
1,I feel like I got robbed...,"Site did not give a size. I thought I was getting a fantastic deal for $1.90; I thought it was like many things I have bought this way and seller just wanted to get rid of them. As it turns out, it is tiny. Let's put it this way: if there were a meerkat game board, this would be a gamepiece. The shipping and handling was $4.99. You could wrap a tissue around this and send it in a regular envelope for 39 cents, and have room left over for 5 more. I am scotch-taping it to my computer deck at work, as a reminder to never, ever do this again."
3,not Minolta NP500,The battery I received from CellularFactory is not the Minolta battery shown in the Amazon picture.It is actually a generic 3.7 volt battery that is slightly thicker and does not remove as easily as the original Minolta battery.The good news is you do not need to pry it out with a knife. It dislodges with one firm shake. (ABOVE A CARPET!!)It also fits a little tighter in my Minolta charger which might be a good thing for reliable charging.There is no excuse for posting a picture of an original Minolta NP-500 and shipping a generic battery.
3,Does The Job,It works but fits too tight (use a sharp knife to remove). They certainly need recharging often
5,Love this movie about horse soldiers.,Yooo Captain Brittles! I'm particulary fond of John Waynes character Nathan Brittles. In the movie Capt. Brittles faces an uncertain future as he faces retirement after spending most of his life in the Army. While other younger officers face having to learn to survive in the battles against the Indians of the frontier. This army at this time had many former confederate soldiers & officers in it. Find this fasinating! As soldiers who once fought each other now fight with each other. I think this is the best of this series.
5,SheWore a Yellow Ribon,"This DVDhas agood story line, however the sound trackis very raspy and the music is hardly recognizeable. Would appreciate a replacement.wilburwib@msn.comPurched fromm Amazon Aug"
2,An old-style western,"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is great for the scenery, for some sense of the cavalry and for anyone who likes to see galloping horses and an old-fashioned bar-brawl in a film. It is not exactly what you would call a psychological film however. I found it surprisingly boring, considering its high acclaim and description as John Wayne's greatest acting feat. The film has no depth: the characters are very simplistic, hardly going beyond a two or three line description: the handsome rival, the rich rival, the hard-drinking Irishman. If you don't have a longing for the cavalry, you aren't going to enjoy this film."
2,watchable,"Watchable, but certainly not one of Ford or Wayne's best -- although very typical of their work together.I would of course push you first toward ""The Searchers,"" but presumably you're aware of that immortal film. Well, if you've gotta have one of Ford's ""cavalry"" movies, I would recommend instead ""Fort Apache,"" which can at least boast a memorable performance by Henry Fonda.This particular movie is more of a straightforward Hollywood cowboys and Indians movie, without anything special to recommend it.It's not awful, however."
5,"Ford and Wayne and company, one of the best","A great movie. My favorite of the Ford Cavalry trilogy. Ford, Wayne, the monument Valley and gorgeous color. Remember first seeing it when I was five years old and have always cherished every opportunity to watch it."
4,One of Wayne's Finest,"John Wayne probably gives the finest performance I've seen him give so far in this story of a Calvary officer, just days before his retirement, who goes on one last assignment. He's accompanied by fellow officer Victor McLaglen who's very funny in a broad way, as well as two stiffly acted young lovers, a subplot that doesn't take too much away from the overall film (fortunately). Wayne has to rely a lot less on heroics in this performance, and instead concentrate on characterization, which he does with much success. He brings depth and a bittersweet quality to his character in a way that might surprise some. With a beautifully photographed backdrop framing each scene, this John Ford feature is sure to please fans of Wayne and Westerns alike."
5,John Wayne in his element,"When this film was released I was six years old, living in grey, cold, bankrupt post war Britain, a world of food and clothing rationing. Cinema was pure escapism and I thank my parents for taking me there every week. Westerns were big in those days. They had titles such as ""Broken Arrow"" or ""Winchester 73"". As my love of cinema was slowly nurtured ""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon"" left an indelible impression on my psyche. I loved every bit of it. The odyessic story, with its lack of 'white man good' 'red indian bad' stereotyping. The sophistication of Ford's direction with its cool appreciation of America's big country. The actors - Wayne, of course, towering above all, and decades before he blotted his copybook with his embarrasing gung-ho roles, to Victor McLagen's 'Oirish' knockabout sargeant, via the under-stated work of Joanne Dru and John Agar. ""Never apologise, son. It's a sign of weakness."" A simply unbeatable movie."
5,"VERY, VERY GOOD PILGRAM","The transfer to dvd is quite good for this movies age. Soundtrack is mono. Not one computer generated special effect. Yet this movie stands head above the pack, John Wayne does some of his finest acting in these calvery films. Its amazing what good writing and acting can do for a film. The story is simple enough yet, were carried away with all the emotions of the film. I reccommened this movie to anyone young enough to not remember when movies werent loaded with special effects to cover up pitifull acting. To anyone young enough not to remember when a woman could act in a film without taking off her clothes, to anyone young enough not to remember how a good story is what movies are all about. I hope you find this film as good as I did."
5,She wore a yellow ribbon.,It was very pleasurable. What I expected. However I received and was billed for two of the Yellow ribbon dvd's. I had thought I was only ordering one.
5,She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,If you love the classic's you will really enjoy this movie. It is good clean fun the whole family can enjoy together.
5,Great movie,"If you are a John Wayne fan as we are, you will enjoy another one of his great movies. I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys his movies."
5,"Second in the ""U.S. Cavalry"" Trilogy","It's in Technicolor. John Wayne's character is retirement age. So watch this film after ""Fort Apache"" and ""Rio Grande""? That'd make sense. Anyway, Wayne gives a bravura performance, as does Victor McLaglen and most of the others save for Joanne Dru (ah, leave her alone). All in all, solid western fare from the great John Ford."
4,she wore a yellow ribbon,"i liked all of john fords movies with john wayne , also i like all of john waynes movies after 1935"
4,HOMAGE TO AN IMPORTANT DIRECTOR,"I've always liked the movies of Robert Aldrich and I bought TOO LATE THE HERO as soon as it was released on the DVD standard. Anchor Bay presents unfortunately only a trailer as bonus feature but the copy is alright.Cliff Robertson is the Aldrichian hero by essence ; he is not a coward but he prefers to enjoy the Pacific beaches rather than to take part in combats. He's a pessimistic hero in a pessimistic movie. The initial credits set extremely well the tone of the film with these at first flamboyant american, british and japanese flags that become little by little less colourful, less arrogant until they finally fade into the dusty reality.A DVD zone Big Bob."
5,Too Late the Hero,Excellent movie. Not your typical WWII movie. Michael Caine and Cliff Robertson do a great job. One of the best war movies ever.
3,Michael Caine and Cliff Robertson action film,"After Robert Aldrich made the classic ""Dirty Dozen"", he tried to recapture the magic by making another WWII action film about a group of misfits on a suicide mission. Well, this is no ""Dirty Dozen"", but it has a lot of action and features two of my favorite actors, Michael Caine and Cliff Robertson, off on a mission to sabotage a Japanese radio installation on a remote island in early 1942. Lots of gunplay! Rated PG."
3,The movie had a lot of action.,"I was an extra in the movie,serving in the u.s.navy at the naval magazine Subic Bay. I got an interview with Cliff Robertson and had quite a time being a British soldier."
2,rent it,"This film is worth renting if you can find it at the local vid store, but it's not worth the purchase price. I bought it and gave it away. The dialogue and acting are dated. Robertson's portrayal of the disaffected, reluctant hero probably was something new when the movie was made, but we've seen it done many times -- and more effectively -- in subsequent films."
3,Nice Prop,"I bought this prop for my studio photography. It is really nice and realistic looking and does the job well. I am a little disappointed with the quality though. I thought it would be made of plastic but rather it is made from a hard foam like material. Working which children, it will be dirtied fast and unable to clean it. I love the cake but not the material."
4,A great book for a rainy day,"I love legal thrillers and this one is definitely a winner. This was the first book I've read by this author in a while but I will be back for more.The characters are believable, the plot was well developed and the ending wrapped up all the loose ends very nicely."
3,I read the end first!,"Having read some of Nancy Rosenberg Taylor's previous work, I found myself disappointed with this one! It was very slow, and it was only after reading the end to find out who the culprit was, that it managed to keep me engrossed a little longer!"
3,challenge,"I am glad to have this document, but can't say I have found it to be a relaxed read. A serious text."
2,Obscure but revealing as to Neo-Platonism,"Provides some thoughtful comments on the concepts of the good and the beautiful. Some insightful thoughts are provided as to perceiving what we truly are as a person (soul) with the focus on improvement. As the soul was an important aspect of early theological thought Plotinus can't leave the subject alone. He works the concept of soul to the point of ascribing a soul to the planets, stars and anything else that moves. One can see why ancient and modern metaphysics has had such a problem escaping from this long held tradition.Unless interested in the development of Plato's teachings and the impact upon later theological philosophy this book does not provide much worthwhile to the modern reader."
5,A clear overview of the fundamental problems facing people,This book is one I go back to again and again because it is such basic and relevant information. He really helps to clarify and make sense of many seemingly competing viewpoints on personality and human devlopment. The birth and death of meaning is for anyone who is interested in what contributes to shaping our behavior and our feelings about ourselves.
4,good read,"Good read, explains alot. Very helpful for the up and coming manager to understand psychology of inquiring minds and some of the borderline people we meet in business."
3,A mixture of good and bad apples,"This a mixture of (supposedly) science fiction stories written by different authors. In reality, however, there are pure fiction, fantasy and mystery stories here. The two stories written by Arthur C Clarke and Larry Niven Compensate largely for this defect."
3,"Charming but very short story, primitive illustrations","This is a thinner page board book, with few colors, and very simple illustrations. There's not much to the story and it seems to end abruptly.I was originally very disappointed with this book in terms of its illustrations and quality, and the end of this story. Having said that, my one year old seems to really like it, so I gave it 3 stars anyway.Here's the story:Big Dog is going for a walk. Little Dog is going, too.Big Dog and Little Dog see something. What do they see?Big Dog thinks it is a kitty. Little Dog thinks so, too.SSSss. But it does not smell like a kitty [it's a skunk]Big Dog smells bad. Little Dog smells bad, too.Big Dog and Little Dog had a bad day. They are going home now. [heads slunk down]...just in time for a party! (picture of a tea party with racially diverse women breaking up).Racially unbiased: checkGender neutral? Probably not. Bunch of ladies having a tea party."
4,a bit more techno than i bargined for...,...but its still got the energy and agressivness that every cd should have...........i bought it thinking it was industrial but its pure techno i'd say. theres no bad songsfor techno lovers only
3,good color fun,"its good, but if you like to save your video games this system isnt for you.it has a good handfull of video of games, and loads of accessories. their wasnt many rpg games for it, but their were tone of casual games like bonkers, and bust a move. since it takes 6 aaa batteries getting a charger is a good idea.theirs also a sega master system adapter allowing you to play sega master system games, the game gear can also play imported games."
5,"Great back then ,but not as great now.","If you like old video game systems then buy it. The screen is ok, the games are fun, but you need alot of batteries."
2,Game Gear....great concept...bad results.,"The Sega Game Gear was a brilliant idea, ahead of it's time, but perhaps that is why it never took off. The colored screen was magnificent. As the previous comment said, Game Boy was hard to over take. Yes Game Boy was in black and white, but it had all of the other things going its way. For example, Game Gear is more expensive, the games are more expensive, it's bigger, and the WORST thing about a Game Gear is that it's not much of a portable gaming system because it ran on 6 AA's I believe...and it died in about 40 minutes of play. The screen being lit was nice for night rides but only lasting 40 mins or so was not acceptable. A good system if you plan on sitting next to an outlet and playing but if you want to travel with it, I'd pass on the Game Gear unless you like paying more than the price of the Game Gear on batteries every couple months."
1,my past fools me again,"i bought the sega game gear because i hold fond memories of it as a kid. it was the best thing around because it had a big color screen and you could take it anywhere. but, for some reason, when i got it and started using it, what i had was not fun. instead, i had buyer's remorse. finding that it wasn't nearly as fun to me now as it was when i was a lad, well, it was nearly traumatizing. if anything good can be said about the game gear, it's that it helps you appreciate the evolution that handheld systems have gone through."
4,LOVE THIS SYSTEM!!!,i love sega and everything they have done with themselves including the genesis ive had two of those things and i played the hell outta them when i was a kid....the game gear is awesome dont get me wrong but the batteries die so quickly my god i put mine in yesterday and they died today wth? but i love it and its all good
5,Hello 1993!!,"Love this gaming device!! Works Great!! Decent graphics for a 19 year old 8-bit first generation color backlit portable handheld gaming device!! This was the precursor to Nintendo's Gameboy Color and of course the ""game changer"".....no pun intended, Sony's PSP. Just remember if you buy a Game Gear gaming system to play these game on, purchase 6 rechargeable batteries!! This thing "" eats"" alkiline battles for breakfast!!"
1,Gameboy killed it.,"This was Sega's handheld. It was big, clunky, hard to see, had terrible sound and not many good games like Gameboy....hence it's dead now."
4,"Great, Fun Music","My husband and I bought the cassette tape of this about 6 years ago while on a Carribean cruise. The music is fun to listen to and also great party or dance music. Our kids loved to listen to it to, however the tape got destroyed and now I would like to replace it with a CD. I would like to see it back in stock and recommend it to anyone who loves ""Jamacian"" type of music."
4,A Barbados Gem!,"Two great singers (Red Plastic Bag and Mac Fingall) from Barbados combine to produce a hip swaying blast from the Deep Caribbean. A bit of reggae, a touch of soca and a large dose of energy make for a memorable album. The opening track...Ragga Ragga...is still a cruise ship staple and it is represented here in two versions...original and extended. Another highlight is Ding Dong...by Fingall."
4,poster,Nice poster but I was fortunate enough to have access to a laminator. I would recommend buying this laminated if possible. It is too easily damaged otherwise.
3,JUON STYLE HORROR,"For those who like creepy young dead boys and dead women walking funny, this is your movie. Jack is a lawyer in Japan. He is being haunted by images of his past when his brother Shawn drowned and he couldn't save him. He is also having an affair with his client's wife, Yuri. The client, Ejii (pronounced A-gee) wants to meet with Jack about business, and you guessed it, on a boat. While out in the ocean Ejii drops hints that he knows about the affair to the point of making everyone uncomfortable. When the boat dies in the water, someone has to go in and clear the seaweed from the props. No sex, no nudity or Japanese school girls being groped."
4,Very Effective,"Okay, yes, we've seen this story, essentially, a million times in one form or another. While some of the Masters of Horror episodes have really tried to be original, this one, rather, focuses on telling the story well and creating a good scare.An American lawyer in Japan is invited on a boat by an important client. We fnd out that our American friend is a) having an affair with his client's wife and b) is afraid of water after having witnessed his brother drowning as a child.You can sort of guess what happens next, but let me tell you that the scenes that were meant to scare-- did on me. Wow, the tension was built up quite nicely and I actually felt for the characters.This is one of the better MOH installments. Out of the 12 episodes I've seen (8 from season 1 and 4 from season 2, this ranks 3rd behind INCIDENT ON AND OFF A MOUNTAIN ROAD and DREAMS IN THE WITCH HOUSE.)"
2,Not up to the high standards set by most Masters of Horror films...,"This movie was weak and not well done. It lacked in many areas, but more specifically was not scary, was not surprising in any way, and was a waste of money (unless like me, you had to just had to have every single Masters of Horror movie for your collection). Beware!Japanese Horror is usually so much better than this."
2,Not a 60-Minute Masters of Horror Epic,"I was extremely disappointed with this segment of MOH because it was not a typical 60-minute horror vignette. It was 90 minutes! Thus, because of its drawn-out and trite content, it probably should have been 45-50 minutes. While I enjoyed many of the visual effects, the script was amateur and unbelievable. The acting was equally under par. I have viewed EVERY Masters of Horror episode from the outset...this one ranks at the bottom. There's no horror in ""Dream Cruise"". Get the facts straight on the length."
5,Great end for a great series!,"What can I say? Mr. Ryan has done it again whith his third book in the ""Errand of Vengeance"" trilogy. I won't go into plot summaries or anything like that (there are plenty of those in other reviews), but I will say that if you've started the trilogy, you'll love the ending. And I'll say this again, if you're a hardcore ST fan, Mr. Ryan won't dissapoint. There are plenty of hidden gems in all three books (other than the wonderful stories themselves) to feed any Trekkie's or Trekker's appetite.I really enjoyed these books and hope Mr. Ryan writes many more."
4,StartupNation,"The book was very inspirational and gave a lot of useful information on how to go about starting up a business, expectations, and how to plan and prepare. I liked the entrepreneurial stories woven throughout the book. However, I was expecting to read more about forming a business plan. I know there is not a one size fits all, but I was looking for some actual examples."
5,A MUST READ,"If you own your own small business or are thinking about starting a business, this is a MUST READ !I started a small business last year, and wish I read this before I started my business...I could have saved myself time and money...How many business owners wish we could save time and money?It is interesting, along with being fun and easy reading.Take their advice, learn from their experiences.It was the best money ""INVESTED"" in my business."
3,For those that have the need.,"If you have a need to add, subtract, etc. many numbers quickly without the aid of electronic devices: this book will help you. It also might be of interest to mathematics teachers. Otherwise, don't bother: your $4 calculator from the grocery store will do just fine."
1,it sucks!!!! sorry!!! buy BILL HANDLEY'S FULL COURSE IN SPEED MATHEMATICS,"I personally find the review very apalling,the good fact of this book is there are lots of drills.I recommend BILL HANDLEY'S full course in speed mathematics for a very simplified straightfowrad approach.THIS book doesn't really teach you a art of calculation,but continuos drills of different calculations.Horrible book don't buy it only if you like to practice continuous drills.garbage!!!!"
4,Gothic-Doom-Death-orquestral-pop(!) compilation,"In this compilations we can see some extremes in the Goth-Doom-Death-pop. There are excellent tracks by In Flames, Crematory, My Dying Bride, Therion, Ever Eve,Alastis and other and some track of suspicious taste such as Lacrimosa(or you love or you hate this band, I hate!),Pyogenesis(the strange Pop section of the CD),sentenced, and dreadful shadows, thanks god that some bands in the BIDII home video aren't here such as dreamside, and some techno stuff!"
3,Masters of Horror Season 1-4,I was very excited to get the season 1 masters of horror on blu-ray. To my disapointment the picture and audio quality on blu-ray was not much better than dvd.
4,Great Album,"This is possibly Meshuggah's best. Thomas Haake's drumming is put to an amazing extreme in the son Future Breed Machine. His creative lyrics also caught my attention(this was the first album of this band i purchased, I've gotten rare trax recently too)In such songs as Inside Whats Within Behind, another good song. Crunchy guitars, amazing drumming, and good use of synthesisers, make this album great. Meshuggah means crazy in yiddish, and it lives up to its name, providing very fast, but surprisingly catch songs, in a blend of thrash and grind core, though it is not very heavy lyrically, or even in the music, but still fast. The music is surprisingly well composed also."
5,Destroy Erase Improve,"This CD is the most sick music ever!It's so heavy it'll make you pull your hair out!Meshuggah is god. If you are a musician in any aspect of heavy music and you've never heard this,then you're a mediocre intrumentalist who's never heard complex or heavy."
5,Destroy Erase Improve!,"Oh boy! Technicality on plastic! Meshuggah create this absolutely brilliant piece of music, each song is worthy of an award. Future breed machine is pummeling, definitely the proper choice for an album opener. The coolest track has to be Beneath. Definitely a sign that Meshuggah is a band that never settles for minimum. Arguably there best release."
3,"Solid,.. but weak for death metal.","This a good album and it is heavy, but not death metal heavy. Despite what you may think or have heard, Meshuggah (atleast this album) is closer to Slipknot,(newer)Fear Factory and Static X type of music than it is to any sort of black metal / death metal. The closest band in similarity is Fear Factory. I like both Meshuggah and FF, but I personally like the vocals from Meshuggah better, and the guitar, bass and drums in Fear Factory better. All the songs on ""destroy.erase.improve"" are solid and have their share of heavy riffs and techno-ish samples. The best song is ""Soul Burn"". If you like Meshuggah you will like: Fear Factory, Static X, Pantera, Down, Snot, Mudvayne, Sepultura, Slayer, Soulfly, Will Haven, Neurosis and maybe Slipknot."
1,Meshuggah [stinks],Meshuggah absolutally symbolizes peice of [junk]music. All they can do is play loud and scream. As bad as there album is their stage show is even worse!!! I saw them open for Tool and for almost an hour they yelled at the top of their lungs and played heavy distorian guitar and horrible bass. If you like metal check out something with some real content like Tool.
4,"Sick, sick, sick...","Although I prefer ""Chaosphere"" because of the increased technical display, this album is pretty amazing. Are you sick of syrupy, maudlin, silly melodic metal bands? Listen to a technical, progressive BRUTAL metal band that creates songs almost completely out of rhythms on top of other rhythms. Simply put, there is not another metal band like this one."
5,If you don't get it........,"it's probably not for you then.This album is just fun really. A lot of people don't understand why some of us get into time changes, clean breaks, precision, polyrythms, etc. A lot of times it gets chalked up to us being music-snobs, pseudo-intellectuals, or whatever. For a lot of us that like Meshuggah, that couldn't be further from the truth. Speaking as a musician, it is just fun to listen to. I have a blast listening to this album and trying to keep up with where it meanders. And when it slams into a straight tempo, Yesu! It is just brutal.So, no ill words for those of you that don't like it. Tis cool, if we all liked the same stuff the world would be pretty boring. But if you are in to listening to music where you know the band is working their collective nards to push their playing, and you like metal of course, this is just a neat album to hear.That's right, I called DEI fun!"
3,Better than most of Meshuggah's albums...,"I only liked a few songs off of this album, but quite frankly, that's more than I like out of most of Meshuggah's albums. The songs I like try to break away from Meshuggah's norm, which seems to be bland repetition vocally, lyrically, and instrumentally. This could have been a lot better, but I don't think any of Meshuggah's albums will live up to Chaosphere."
2,Give me an aspirin,"I first heard of Meshuggah back in like 96 or so when i picked up Destroy,Erase,Improve.Basically because it said undeniable Thrash Metal.Therefore i assumed like Slayer,Old Metallica,Overkill,kinda vein,boy was i wrong.I never really liked it even after many listens to this day,year 2004 i still can't get into them.I've tryed many times only to reach for the aspirin bottle,i do think they are talented but you just can't follow anything they do.I played in a band similar to this one(as the drummer)and i can honestly say it was the least fun music i've ever played.No fun,when you have to sit and think about ever polyrythmic beat your hitting.Its like having sex you don't wanna have to think about it,you just do it.Improv is way more fun.Also there is not one bit of melody to any of they're songs,so unless you like total confusion in your music,stay away."
2,Vocals good but that's it,"I admit these guys have talent but there songs just don't make any sense. You never know where anything is going. The riffs change so much that it gets so annoying. You'll here something you like for a second then the song totally changes and you'll never here the same riff again. I guess some of you people consider it talent to be able to do this however, it's not very fun to listen to. However, I do enjoy the vocals, he has a good metal voice."
5,the all mighty time change!,People who listen to music in the genre of anything that is radio friendly will never have the mind compacity to ever under stand the complexity of a musical time change. Band's like Candira and the metalic beasts Meshuggah along with a slew of other mind bending talented bands have wrapped up the behemoth of the all mighty time change along with other metalic music mastery and created music for the true heavy metal fan! These bands have created music for people like me to enjoy while excersising their train of thought in the process...
3,interesting,"They do two things right: get a great heavy guitar tone, and write great guitar riffs.I think they have an interesting approach. Lots of heavy polyrhythmic riffs and lots of odd time signatures (12/8, etc...) It is a good start. However, the lyrics stink, the vocalist stinks, and the songwriting stinks. They subscribe to the connect-a-riff school of songwriting, just stringing together a bunch of riffs and calling the end result a song. At least they are good riffs.I would recommend it if you are looking for heavy, polyrhymic, prog guitar riffs, or if you are a MetalHead looking for something a little different.Tech Note: Both guitarists wield Ibanez Universe guitars, and they tune them down to Bb!"
5,Great Album,"Loud obnoxious metal from a great band. I started out with most of their later albums (Nothing, Chaosphere, Catch 33), and kind of kicked myself that I did not purchase this album earlier. A great album to play for that friend who listens to Nickleback or Breaking Benjamin while puffing his chest out. Guaranteed to scare the crap out of your neighbors also.If your looking for qualities such as musicianship and song writing, come on, it's Meshuggah, these guys are Bad A$$!"
2,It gets the job done.,It gets the job done. That's about all I can say about it. The wireless TTL doesn't work on my K10d. If I could go back I would buy Pentax or the lower model Sigma.
5,"""Don't gob on me, gob on your mother!""","""Forget the music, just look at the condition of this guy."" This is prime Thunders and the original Heartbreakers before Johnny waltzed directly into the void. More walking talking attitude than musician, if you can't handle the real stuff, try the Hansons instead. R.I.P., L.A.M.F."
1,Not what I ordered.,"This was a gift I ordered and didn't know that it was different from what I ordered until my sister-in-law told me. I contacted the company twice about sending it back, and they never responded. So, my sister-in-law kept it and I bought her another gift, as well. Very disappointed in the fact that the company just never responded."
1,Mariella. Burani,I don't like that scent. The other Mariella scents are much better but now you cannot get them and if you find them they are sooooo outrageous. What is going on?
3,eh,"I like the idea of it and I'm sure this next summer I'll get more use out of it. The cloth straps are very bulky in a way, and don't tend to want to stay up around my leg. I love the shoe and the look of it, though."
4,A relaxing read for people interested in movies and the people that make them,"If you are a movie fan or just interested in the lives of the people who make them, then this is a book that will interest you. The quotes, trivia, questions and stories about people in the American movie business present many sides of their lives. My favorite quote in the book was by Marilyn Monroe:"" Hollywood is a place where they'll pay you $50,000 for a kiss and 50 cents for your soul.""Since it is not deep by any means, this is a book to be read in relaxing times when you want to read and be entertained but not think too hard."
4,We Killed God at Magdaberg.,"The film directed by James Clavel and based on his book is a dark and brooding peace depicting the world savage and cruel of the thirty years war. Michael Caine plays the Captain the leader of a band of mercenaries who come across a valley free from the ravages of war, plague and pestilence. Omar Sherif plays Vogel a teacher and traveller who too has in adversity stumbled across a promised land. The story that follows is a study of politics, love, war and religious dogma. Caine gives an excellent performance as a realist who understands only too well the nature of the latter, though finding solace and mutual education with the teacher Vogal. The films closing battle scenes could have been taken from a period woodcut of the time apocalyptic and hellish in there vision, the film stands today as worthy example of expressive rather than decorative historical drama."
5,The Last Valley w/ Michael Caine,It's an oldie but a goodie with Michael Caine. It's set in the medieval times when the Black Plague was prominent and there were lots of Power Battles for land posession. The valley is the perfect place to winter his mixed band of Christian and Protestant troops but he falls for the leader of the community's wife. This brings a new kind of struggle for the weary Caine.
4,A little stiff but worth serious consideration,"The acting is a tad stiff, the dialog likewise, and I've seen better battle scenes. Even the storyline is fairly predictable in its development. So why four stars? For the period and the overall feel. Not too many stories out there regarding the 30 Years War and the general confusion and anarchy. Costumes, scenery, etc. carry off the illusion of the period very nicely. If you let yourself flow into the movie, this can be very enjoyable, entertaining, and even educational."
4,A touching film,"This is a movie where one can feel and breathe the atmosphere of the 17th century in ""medieval"" Europe during the Thirty Years War, with its ignorance and violence. How servile and oppressive to accept the delivery of some maids to the soldiers that occupy the ""peaceful"" valley!. It is impressive the role of the Captain played by Michael Caine as a professional warrior symbol, the role of Per Oscarsson as a fanatical priest is impressive too. Of course there is also some place for love in the film. The end is shocking and almost everybody is moved by this epic story."
3,"Involving, Low-Key Epic","Smart script but mostly uninspired filmmaking prevent this from being quite the lost classic it's sometimes billed as. Both leads are good with Caine doing one of his rare accents and it doesn't falter. Florinda Bolkin fascinates. Unfortunately, the villagers are done up in such garishly colorful clothes the picture at times looks like Heidi and the brutal truths the film tries to get at are undercut."
3,The Expurgated Cut,"This is very much a movie worth seeing, but I am not at all pleased that some ninny took it upon themselves to censor this film. This is not the movie as it was released to theaters and shame on ABC Pictures for failing to release this in its original form. The image of the DVD itself is grainy and apparently no effort was put into trying to clean the film up (from a technical stand point at any rate).Having said that, IMO this is the single best performance Michael Caine ever turned in, and he is a darn fine actor. See it if you get a chance, but look for a version beside the MGM/ABC Pictures release."
3,"""revolution for the hell of it""","This picture shows a group of men who kill people simply because they are there. But even more scary is those people who torture others in the name of some fervently held beliefs. Perhaps there is more here for our time than most now suspect. As logic and science are forbidden to be taught in the schools and colleges of the fanatical left and of the religious right, any humanistic or reasoned restraint will be absent from the minds and hearts of future generations. The wars that are now being fought with words and books--could they eventually become battles of blood? It seems impossible, but I'm sure that the events of the Thirty Years War would have seemed preposterous to the people in the Renaissance."
1,Disorganized and boring.,If you have insomnia then this movie is for you. It is sure to put you to sleep. It is like counting sheep.
1,dvd unplayable,"The Last Valleythe dvd arrived promtly,new as ordered,it came postmarked from canada,have tried again and again but keeps saying wrong region code!!!!,have not had this happen before,have read cover and find nothingdiffrent to other dvds,so what is the problem!!."
1,Dust collector,"Your kid will be frustrated by how the cheap parts break, you will get annoyed when they keep bugging you about how the screws get stripped and you have to tape it together and then when all is said and done, they use it once and then go outside and play basketball and that thing just sits on some shelf until you decide to just throw it away. Don't buy it. Save your money."
3,Fun family project,"We bought this for our 12 year old who has always wanted his own robot. The advertisement said it was suitable for 10 and up and was labeled as ""beginner"" and easily assembled. I would say you need to be a very mechanically inclined 10 year old to do it alone because it took both my 12 year old and my 41 year old husband to put it together. Once together it's really cute, but would be better if you didn't have to completely take the arms off every time you wanted to change positions. In order to switch between ""orangutan,"" ""gorilla"" and the other two positions you have to unscrew the arms and put on the other arms. My husband and son had fun working on it together though and it was cute crossing the room above our heads, but it's as great as it could have been."
3,Good Classic Animation,"This is a very good film for what it is, a first stab at an animated feature film. Think along the lines of some of the very early Disney films such as Snow White although not quite as well done. The film itself has not been digitally cleaned up so you actually see flaws that existed in the copy from which they obtained the images. That being said, both my daughters, ages 6 and 8 love the film because of its simplicity and some of its goofy humor."
2,"Excellent film, very poor quality","One of the truly great early animated films, on a par with Disney if not better in some ways. Really worth having it for the rotoscoping, etc., but this version really suffers from the extremely low quality of the transcription. I'd buy it again if a better version comes out."
1,This Gulliver should stay lost!,This is the worst product I have ever purchased on Amazon. You can see it better on Youtube. Grainy washed out footage worst than any bootleg movie. Stay away!
1,They Ruined IT!!!!,What a piece of crap. The color restoration is appalling and the sound is definately not surround sound. Give me the original any time! Rita
1,"Historically interesting, but nothing more","Gulliver's Travels is interesting to any student of animation history, but frankly, there's a good reason why this movie failed and Snow White succeeded. Technical prowess notwithstanding, it offered none of the ""magic"" -- the fun -- that people look for in great animated stories. Calling Gulliver's character ""dull"" is being kind. Every other character is either boring or irritating -- and boring or irritating your audience is never a good thing. The music is trite as well. To top it all off, the restoration is of very poor quality, making the film hard to watch even if you do find the story interesting."
5,Excellent DVD and Great Service!!!,"The DVD arrived quickly and is in excellent shape! I haven't seen the ""Gulliver's Travels"" Gabby cartoon since I was about 5 and then I saw it on our old Motorola black and white boob tube. I've finally seen it in glorious living color and the remastering is so sharp and crystal clear it looks like it was shot yesterday. The sound is also great and I can't thank you enough for sending me this great cartoon I've always loved. We will most definitely be doing business again! Thanks so much!"
1,Vision Video Classic Collection Version Big Disappointment,"I've loved this movie since I was a child, but the Vision Video Classic Collection version of it is awful. The video and audio quality are worse than that of the VHS tape we've had for over 20 years. Also, there is no menu, no chapters. Big disappointment."
1,Terrible,This is a terrible redo. They took a 4:3 frame and stretched it. Never do that. Leave it in its original format. E1 is not up to snuff to do this apparently.
5,Classic,"I wish my kids who are all grown up could appreciate the animation for this time it was made, its beautiful, really the colors etc.. you can see this was hand drawn.. I love it"
3,Historic Animation,"Max and Dave Fleischer's first full-length cartoon represents an admirable alternative to Disney, but is terribly uneven. ""Gulliver's Travels"" (1939) has some memorable sequences that cry for a tighter script and stronger characters. Regardless of its flaws, the Technicolor production is wonderful to look at - while the songs are relatively pleasant. The Fleischers would fare better with their second feature: the criminally underrated ""Hoppity Goes to Town"" (1941). If you're fortunate enough to find an original copy, the out-of-print Hal Roach/Image DVD is the best version available."
5,"The ""Gulliver's Travels"" of My Childhood!","Found ""Gulliver's Travel's"" via Jessica Dragonette. Ordered it. To my delight, it came quickly and was in perfect condition. No worries at all."
1,!!!Warning!!!,Warning! I purchased this copy by [...] and was shocked to find that the All's Well sequence was missing. After Gulliver passes out on the beach it skips to the scene in the castle.
1,poor version,"A couple of years ago I purchased the 60th Anniversary Edition of this classic Fleischer cartoon on VHS. It was digitally re-mastered and was a beautiful print. HOWEVER, this version, THE DVD VERSION is of very poor quality. The dub is scratchy at best and is more often than not, washed out.The film starts out without the opening credits and we noticed entire scenes have been deleted (as if taken from a bad film version that had been spliced together). ... Apparently, the 60th anniversary re-mastered edition is not available on DVD (at least I cannot find it). Your kids may be entertained but if you consider yourself a Fleischer fan or an animation fan, you will find THIS DVD VERSION very disappointing."
1,Gulliver's Travel,"It's a very old and bad copy from a original and excellent clasic. A pity. Not have aditional idioms and subtitles, like spanish. This information it's out of the saling panel."
4,Very realistic,"Shows how drugs can negatively affect people and cause one to lose everything, very quickly. Great acting by both James Woods and Sean Young."
4,More than a movie about cocanie,"This is a great film but because it was made in the 1980s the drug of choice ,cocaine, is a major plot point.However it is also about the ""America Dream"" and how it all goes wrong.James Woods(Lenny) is the get ahead at any cost kind of person with a beautiful wife he thinks he doesn't deserve.He ends up pitching a phony partnership tax shelter to a bunch of rich guys trying to keep their money out of the IRS's hands.You will see alot of wrong in these people but if you take away the cocaine and look at the ""salesman"" you will find it very timely.This film reminds me of the way everything is sold today from God to goverment.Lenny could just as well be a ""Market Amercia"" salesman telling you how you can get rich today."
1,flash,Good Flash does not last long though. I bought the flash about a year ago as a back up flash. I barely used it and the flash bulb burnt out on it very quickly. Unfortunately the warranty just ran out when it quit working and i have to trash a barely used flash.
3,"helped in my KC appreciation beyond ""Discipline""","The disc one songs, ""Happy Hour..."", and ""Return to Sector B"" are intricate in their beats, and they evoke for me a wide and changing range of (pleasant) emotional responses each time I hear the CDs. Never degenerating into chaotic noise, these listed songs are assertive without being bullying. ""Return"" felt moody, alien and engrossing.The problem with the discs has already been mentioned in the reviews: the aimless, almost ambient feel of the bulk of side two. In a few cases, when the songs started to get interesting, the songs promptly ended.Despite that, the album stays in rotation in my cd player, and acclimated me to both the more challenging Vroom / Thrak albums, and the standout ""Masque"" (ProjeKct 3)."
4,but I like it anyway.,"This ain't King Crimson. Adrian Belew puts away his guitar, steps away from the microphone, and sits down at the electronic drum kit, from whence he generates his own thick stew of funkesque grooves for Trey Gunn and Robert Fripp to jam over.And that's what this is - a spontaneous jam session between musicians who happen to be in King Crimson. What works about it is that we hear Robert Fripp apparently having a lot of fun just being himself at the guitar chair. He is one of the true original masters, and it's good to hear him get excited about his work in a group setting.This was essentially an early rehearsal, so the live ProjeKCt 2 (toured extensively in the first half of 1998) was much better than this, but this is the best we have from them on CD so far."
4,A great present for any age!,"I bought this as a present for an older family member, because she loves bugs and had always wanted an ant farm her whole life. Since she'd never gotten one, I decided to bring out the kid in her by presenting her with this as a Christmas gift last year. She mailed away for her ants in the spring and was so excited that she set the ant farm up days in advance so she could put them right in upon arrival. She was like a little kid! I never thought I'd see an adult so mesmerized and excited by such a simple present. It was fantastic. She even made it a centerpiece in the living room. Strange as it may sound, it made a great conversation piece! To-date I am still thanked constantly for this present. In fact she even asked for the smaller Ant Factory so she can hook them together. This is my favorite gift I've ever given. I would recommend the Ant Factory to any ant fan of any age! You're never too old to love an ant farm!"
1,Not a book about Jdeveloper,"This book was originally called JBuilder Essebtials. They have simply changed the cover. All references within this book are to the JBuilder IDE not the JDeveloper IDE. Althought the envirnonments are similar there are differences that make the book unusable in some circumstances. If you are looking for a book on Jdeveloper look elsewhere or buy JBuilder Essentials, it's cheaper."
2,The online help of JDeveloper is better,"We're now about to get JDeveloper 3 (at this moment still in beta - beginning of October 99) that has very excellent support for Oracle8i and Oracle Application Server 4, Servlets, Java Server Pages, Java Stored Procedures etc. etc. and the books and online help and examples provided with the product itself are presumably better than any book can be. Apart from that: the GUI-Beans have changed as well - supporting Swing etc. No more JBCL's ... Fazit: Get the product, read what you get included with it and you have the best basis you can get. You dont need this book really. Well, at least not anymore, because at the time it came out it had some interesting information."
2,Does't tell you anything you couldn't figure out,"I use Jdeveloper at the office, and I thought that this book could help me with some of the finer points of using this software package. It did not. It touches on the basic stuff, but if you want to create any EJB components and deploy them, this book is no good for you. There is a book from Oracle that is targeted from development for 8i and it is more useful to a developer. The topics that this book covers are very trivial and out of date for the most part (Jdeveloper 1.x)."
2,A below average book from Oracle Press,"Although it covers all the aspects of JDeveloper, the author struggles between teaching Pure Java and JDeveloper. Very poor/less examples. I would prefer some other book."
1,"Superficial, very disappointing","Suitable to guide you through using the JDeveloper programming interface, but not nearly enough to get you up to speed with Java. Lacking in detail and depth of examples particularly when trying to build even a relatively simple database application that has multiple tables/views/queries etc..."
2,JBuilder not JDeveloper,"As indicated in previous reviews, the book does not really cover specifics of JDeveloper. This book is an inferior JBuilder 2.0 overview. It would be nice to have a JDeveloper 3.1 book, but alas it is not yet available."
2,Gives only basic knowledge.,The book is not covering the indepth information of JDeveloper's all features. (Specifically DataBase related issues)
1,Get a better book,Hope Oracle press will come up with better book than this one. Better follow the documentation from Oracle Corporation.
5,A swiss army knife of mathematical tools for finance,"It actually is a mathematical tool chest illustrated with numerous finance examples. As such it provides a finance professional with a quick review of elementary probability and statistics, linear algebra, calculus (stochastic and normal) and numerical methods. Teall's method is to explain the basic mathematical concepts and then to illustrate those concepts with a variety of financial examples.For an applied finance professional, the book offers a solid review of various numerical methods and shows you how to apply them in a variety of settings. Incredibly, this is all done in under 250 pages. Between the explanations of the theory and the examples of the applications, finance professionals should be able to take the information in the book and apply it to their day to day lives. The book's brevity and focus on applied work are likely to make it more useful than longer more theoretical tomes."
3,Easy read but not much help for me,"The Becnel's book was a little disappointing. I was expecting a more professional / Christian perspective on how to blend fmailies but instead most of it was personal experiences of the Becnel's. My blended family differs from theirs so much of it was not useful. There was some duplication through out the book and most of the thoughts were common sense or biblical, which I am already familiar with. There were excerpts that I deeply agreed with such as you must put your spouse first but in more than one place it said in order to truly love your spouse you must love your spouse's children. Well, that is the whole reason I am seeking literature on blended families - I struggle to love my ""bonus"" children while I am crazy about their father. And likewise, I do not expect my spouse to love my grown sons in order to love me. Again, the book is more an autobiography of the Becnel's."
5,A God centered view of how to raise a blended family,This book is a tremendous tool to have in learning how to tackle virtually any of a blended family's hurdles using a faith based approach. I highly recommend it after having been through the class based on the book that the authors personally teach as well. There truly isn't anything like it! You will be blessed!
2,Not what I was looking for...,"When purchasing this book I was looking for something to prepare my family and I as we become a blended family, and this book did not supply the practical advice I was looking for. I am a Christian and I appreciated how spiritually grounded this family is, however I believe I was looking for active advice for helping my family rather than turning every thing over to prayer. Their approach to blending their family seemed passive or at least the advise they gave seemed more passive than suits my style. The biblical quotes throughout the book were inspirational but not particualarly helpful. I will keep looking for the right book for me and donate this to my church's reference library."
2,Sorry but... no!,"Hmmm... this is a pain cause I really think, that Krav Maga is one of the very rare self defense systems, that do really work when it comes to fighting outside the gym. On hand to hand combat, that is. But knives...The problem is, that in general most of the people who tell you something about defending against a knive seem to know not very much abou how to use a knive in fighting. To keep it short - some of the defenses shown here may work - if you are a very well trained, experienced and cold blooded fighter. If you are a beginner, you will end up with the insides of your arms and legs cut open - which can be fatal.Two stars - because Krav Maga is so very very effective in hand to hand combat and because some of the things shown here might work. If you are lucky or the knife-guy is a slob.Definetly not for beginners!"
2,Morgan Men's Lite Thermal Shirt,"I use different Thermal shirts at work I have about ten different ones the Morgan Men's Lite Thermal Shirt the large size have a small problem ,the sleeves are to short for me I use a large size and the sleeves are about three inches to short I still use them but if the sleeves were I little longer I most likely was going to buy some more."
5,Awesome,"Not only was the movie awesome and hilarious, there was nothing wrong with the movie, no scratches, it was all fine! :)"
3,Nice,Its a sequel that lacks the humor of the first one. Its a low budget movie so you cant. Expect a lot.
4,Good clean movie!,This is one of my children's favorite movie. It is cute and full of whit and charm. It is a little corny in some spots yet cute in others.
2,Not worth the time,"The first Single's Ward movie was one of my favorite movies of all times. It was absolutely hillarious! I have also seen RM, Home Teachers and other good LDS comedies. This movie really disappointed me. It wasn't funny at all. I knew that sequels are almost always a let down but I wasn't prepared to be let down this much. I am just grateful I didn't buy it~"
3,A knock off of the first movie,"This movie has it's good moments, unfortunately most of them are making fun of the first Singles ward movie. Watch it for some laughs, but I wouldn't buy it. (Trust me on this, I own it and should have just rented)"
3,I am not sure if it was a good idea to get this,"Overall, I like the system features and performance.I love that it is a tablet - it is so much more convenientthan a regular laptop.There is one very annoying problem with this model though:the keyboard is ""sticky"" - meaning, despite this tablet isbrand new and just arrived, when I press and release a key on the keyboard it acts as if I kept it pressed, continuing totype the same character again and again. Sometimes, when I compose an email and press the ""DEL"" key to delete a character - ooops! - it deletes half of the email. Unfortunately, this problem happens way too often, a few times per day. I did not expect this behavior from a new computer."
1,three guys named moke,the movie was good but this copy is very bad you can get a better copy watching tv
4,"Movie good, but DVD could have been produced better","The movie is great fun, but the producers of this DVD really made it a ""no-frills"" product--not even a menu for scene selection.Overall the service was good, the movie came quickly, and the movie itself is enjoyable. I'm a Howard Keel fan, which prompted me to buy the movie, and he does a fine job as one of the Mikes interested in Jane Wyman."
3,Three Guys Named Mike,"This was a very disappointing movie. With such a great cast I expected something better. To Me it was a no account movie , which didn't seem to go anywhere. Did she choose the right Mike ? Well, I am not sure about that & anyway, it doesn't really matter. I am sorry I cannot recommend this movie . I thought it a waste of money."
3,"Well played, but uneventful","I must say I didn't quite know what to expect from this movie. The title is great, the acting was adequate, but I feel the characters either weren't developed or weren't developed quick enough. It just seemed really slow and didn't really pick up steam. Even at the end, I feel like there could have been more chemistry developed with the Mike's and the roommates. It was a bit flat. It's difficult to find a film that is not filled with sexual innuendo or outright explicit scenes or language. I would love to see a modern remake of this film, but all in all, I can't really recommend it for viewing. I felt like it was just below par and I wouldn't waste my time watching it again."
3,"Good, though it's missing a certain something...","That certain something is ""Weekend on Mars"" -- a really terrific song that was on my old cassette tape but not on the CD. It's a shame as this is far better than the ""Beautiful Gardens"" or ""Surfin' Dead"" tracks on here. When will the complete version of this concert come out?"
3,"Ladies and gentlemen, live from the Peppermint Lounge, the Cramps.","This was originally a six song EP released in 1983. It was recorded live at the Peppermint Lounge in February of 1983. This CD features two additional songs recorded at the same concert. The songs consist of Cramps originals plus a cover of the theme song from ""Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" and a cover of the Count Five's ""Psychotic Reaction"". This is a decent live recording, but not really the Cramps at their best. The CD also includes the song the Cramps recorded for the movieThe Return of the Living Dead, ""Surfin' Dead"" (one of my personal favorite Cramps songs). I believe this was also the first time that Poison Ivy posed for a ""cheesecake"" photo for an album cover."
1,Bare Archives,The BBC must be in trouble if this is the best that they could do. Apart from a very brief Callas appearance (we tend to forget how great she was) and some nostalgia for a youngish charming but not particularly great Menuhin (and he had many great performances but not here) ....the rest was immediately forgettable.... The French archives must be even worse than the Brits.
3,Vengence,"Being a huge noir detective fiction fan I found it a little difficult to muddle through this installment in the Amos Walker series. The plot starts out in typical fashion and then goes on to become Walker out for revenge, sort of like Walking Tall or something along those lines. The ending went back to a typical hard-boiled style of ending with the detective confronting the person behind the mayhem which was nice. Unfortunately this one just didnt do it for me. Estleman is definitly an accomplished author and all the other reviewers of this novel are right on target with most of their reviews but the revenge angle just didnt work for me."
1,Sinister depths,"Amos Walker is one of the very best detective series out there. This, however, was just awful. Start at thebeginning of the series, read them all, skip this one."
1,A complete throwaway,"Some of the Amos Walker novels are excellent. Sinister Heights is not one of them. The book has a too-short plot, so Estleman pads the novel with gobs of politico-babble, a car chase, and one of the most far-fetched endings I have ever read. Don't waste your time."
3,Go Girl,"The content of this album is overall Good. However, the musicstyle or composer is not as tender and passionate as the Shania we allknow. I understand that in the music business that we have to step outto stay, so to speak. But why compromise good passionate music just to stay in. Thanks Shania for your music most of it is uplifting and encouraging to me and many other people around the world."
1,dissappointed in San Francisco,"What is this? Has shania gone rock, Alabama is country rock, Shania has missed the boat on this album. I have waited so long for a new album I guess I will have to keep on waitng for the next one!"
3,Not What I'd Expected,"This is not the Shania who's music I know and love. I'm very hard pressed to recognize her voice in any of the tracks, and this is more like rock & roll from the mid-80's than it is anything else. Reminescent of....Heart. Some may recall that ""Half Breed"" was a hit for Sonny and Cher many years ago. It sounds fine on the CD, but, still, it's not the Shania I know. Shania's first three CDs are still her best work. However, no collection of Shania's music would be complete without this CD. So, if your as big a fan as I am of Shania's, by all means buy this one. If not, be advised, there is no trace of country, or adult contemporary on this CD. It's all rock. I was a little disappointed, but I'll keep it."
3,Not The Best Robot,This robot is not the best one. It is an easy assemble until the wheels. The crankshaft and the gear on the motor do not line up. The wheels move right or left. I had to move the crankshaft all the way over so it would stay put. All the robot does is roll around and if you clap it turns around. This robot was not very fun for me. I would not recommend this toy.Teddy S.
4,Very Good!,"I used to buy this rice at Publix in Florida, but couldn't find it when I moved to Pittsburgh. No big deal, I thought I would just find another ""spicy rice"" from another store. Nope, none to be found! Lots of saffron and yellow rices, some spicy rice with beans, but I couldn't find any spicy saffron rice on it's own. This has a good texture, and a wonderful spicy taste - without being ""overly"" spicy. Now I order enough to qualify for free shipping - and don't have to worry about it going bad."
3,Does the Job,"I use the Super Satchel Series in my sewing space. I love them! I bought this as a storage solution for some of my smaller notions.It has the same sturdy construction as the Super Satchel series; you could fling this across the room and it would be fine. I was expecting more flexibility in terms of being able to configure the compartments. Also some are very deep, others very shallow. It turned out not to be what I needed for my sewing stuff, so I ended up purchasing theEasy View Tote: 6833ABThe trays in it were what I was really looking for.My true complaint about the product is the the tabs used to close each side. They are very difficult to work with."
5,a pleasure to read.,"this is one of the first books i've read about feminism, so i don't proclaim to be an expert, but i really enjoyed reading so many different perspectives about feminism. these women's opinions were interesting to read. i read it straight through one afternoon and was sad to put it down. i particularly enjoyed the essays by curtis sittenfield, abra chernik, nomy lamm, laurel gilbert, jennifer myhre, and cheryl green. the essays seemed a little short to me, though. but my one beef with the book is that every single one of writers was a well-educated woman who had gone at least for her bachelor's. what about women who weren't able to go to college? the book seemed to emphasize varieties of feminism but that varieties of education wasn't taken into account surprised me. there are feminists out there with merely a high school education or even less. i hope maybe someday to see a sequel to this book where those factors are taken into account."
2,Nothing new to the established feminist,"If you haven't read much feminist literature, then I imagine that you would find this an interesting book. If you're looking for women's views on feminism - this isn't the book. It is a modern anthology of women's experiences.I have read a number of books on feminism and found that this book, disappointingly, provided little new on the topic. The stories, although not always well written, are sincere and honest."
4,"Nice but a bit ""watered down""","""Rain"" is a classic pre-censorship movie of the 30's. As usual with this type of film, one must do a fair amount of reading between the lines to get the full story. Joan Crawford gives a strong performance as Sadie Thompson, a trollop on the run from the law. Walter Huston as Alfred Davidson, a bible thumping, over the top preacher, is sufficiently scary. The rest of the cast puts in fine performances. The cinematography is also exceptionally elegant.The story is a bit watered down from it's Somerset Maugham original, and some extreme leaps of believability are needed on the part of the audience to accept the denouement. But the story is strong and powerful and surprisingly up-to-date considering it is almost 70 years old. It would seem the religious right has been throwing its muscle around longer than we think.I highly recommend ""Rain"", if for no other reason than to see Joan Crawford in the type of role that made her famous."
2,Poor DVD release,"This isn't one of those product reviews that tells you about the movie, but a real product review.The image quality hasn't been improved, and you could even think that the transfer was direct from a tape or film in really deplorable quality. It doesn't even contain proper DVD menus, so when you're looking at content, there's no way of going back to the main menu.There's also no subtitles or caption, so only recommended for English speakers with no hearing problems.Think more than twice before getting this DVD, unless you're a really big fan of the movie already."
2,Not what I expected,"Poor quality and the acting was not very good. The sterotypes are true to the time period, but was just to much to take in 2009. I'm happy to give this one way!"
1,Diaappointed,I thought it tried to make christians look bad. I don't care for movies like that. A total waste of Joan Crawford talent. And yet alot of reviewers loved it. If you want to see a good Joan Crawford movie Autumn Leaves is superb.
2,"Dropped calls, poor reception","After having first a Sprint serviced Sanyo, then a Cingular serviced Nokia for service, I was very pleased with the Cingular service. When I got my new service, therefore, I stuck with Cingular and got the P107 (rebates, picture phone, etc.)I am very disappointed.Compared to my last phone:1. I have 3-4 times as many ""dropped calls"" in the same service area which used to have excellent coverage. I can only assume this is the phone.2. The sound quality for both reception at the cell phone, and people I'm calling on the other end is very poor. I have had 2 friends tell me idependently not to call them with that phone because the hollow noises ""are too annoying.""3. The features, such as the camera, web browser, and mail are difficult and non-user friendly at best.4. It has a nice color screen.I would recommend buying another phone."
1,Awful product!,"After owning this new phone for 3 months, half of the screen went blank. Samsung would not repair this--you have to go thru many customer service people to get nowhere. The phone was not dropped and has no scratches on it. One rep said you can't have keys in your pocket or it ruins the LCD screen! Who would make a product like that? One rep said whenever the LCD screen is bad they say it is 'physical abuse' and don't fix it--they've got this one down. Save your time and money--don't buy this phone!"
2,Don't bother wasting your money...,"Now I'm not going to bash this phone. I'm going to give you my honest opinion. Dont get this phone.Now I dont own it, but my friend does and let me tell you, it's not all it's cracked up to be. Sure, it looks luxerious and beautiful on the outside, but dont let the sleek looks fool you.The camera quality leaves much to be desired, it takes very low quality pictures, and you dont have the option of caller ID.. and that's the main reason I'd buy a camera phone.. so I could literally see who's calling. Most ringtones sound horrible and washed out when you purchase them. The outer cover of the phone may look nice, but over time it wears down, tiny pieces of plastic fleck off, etc. The browser is old, the download times are much slower than most of today's phones, and it locks up and glitches up all the time. The phone is out of date. When Cingular put it on the market they took it off shortly after.. because it was a dud."
2,Samsung,"This phone is good and bad. I really wished it had Picture Caller ID. Also, after dropping it once, it all started falling apart. The volume adjust arrows don't work, my antenna is chipping away. The games on it are horrible unless you're into flying a spaceship around tying to kill little alien ships. Then you can't even download any games to it. I recommend to not get this phone. I had the X427 before this and it was not that great either. Battery life does not last. I have had the phone for about 5 months and I am on my 3rd battery. The phone often freezes and I sometimes have to end a call by removing the battery. The only good thing is the camera but if this phone had picture caller ID, that would be a great feature. My next phone will not be made by Samsung, I am sure of that."
1,Cingular Rebate Program,"Such a program is the worst one yet. Every time I plan to sign up for one of their wireless plans I would get a reject email, explaining that ""Cingular Wireless needs additional information"" after I provided everything that was needed."
4,"Without a doubt, BRUTALITY's finest effort.","'When the Sky Turns Black' isn't really a landmark in Death Metal history or anything, but it's my pick as BRUTALITY's best album ever. The vocals on here are the most extreme of all the BRUTALITY albums, the lyrics are excellent, the guitar work is unique, the blasting drumming is superb... what else can i say? This is great Old School Death Metal! There are 10 songs on here and i don't like 2 of them so my 4 out of 5 rating is accurate. If there's only one BRUTALITY album you buy, i would recommend 'W.t.S.T.B.' over 'Screams of Anguish' { Which isn't bad either, but not quite as fast or well produced } and * DEFINITELY * over 'In Mourning' { Just about the worst Death Metal album I've ever heard, and a truly huge dissapointment for me, considering what greatness BRUTALITY had achieved earlier }."
2,dull.,"This is like really boring death metal. They don't do nothing different like Morbid Angel and Hypocrisy. They seem to play with no feeling and the songs all sonund the same. Better than Cannibal Corpse, but not by much. So-so."
5,Unexpected surprise!,"I must say the song that got me curious was""She walks this Earth.""I looked high and low for song thinking it something Sting made on a new solo cd.But,when I found out it was part of a compilation,I still wasn't sure I wanted to buy it.I am glad I ignored that feeling because I utterly enjoyed this cd and wish they would do another one!If like an ecclcetic mix of songs with great singers,you will like this!"
5,A Love Affair: The Music Of Ivan Lins,"I discovered this album because I'm a fan of Vanessa Williams, who contributes one track. Nicely produced with various performers and varied styles within the Brazilian jazz idiom.Some real nice tunes and renderings.One of the highlights for me, not surprisingly, is Vanessa's offering, ""Love Dance,"" which is a killer ballad, delivered with such delicacy and grace as only Vanessa can. A stunning track. Worth the price of the CD, alone."
3,A Love Affair,"I could not think of a song of Ivan Lins when I heard 'She Walks This Earth"" sung by Sting. This song sells the CD and as for me....It was worth the purchase. After that, I could'nt get into it as much as I tried. All the artist on the CD were wonderful. It's just not a CD that requires listening to, with passion, more than once or twice. Sting....YES. Perhaps it's over my head and I need to listen again."
5,Every time you listen to it,"This album shows that music can be simply beautiful and gets better with time.I would swear that everytime I listen to it, I like it more and more.Plus, it will send you seeking out more of Ivan Lins work. I discovered this by accident and now wonder what other great music I am missing out on."
2,Hypocrisy tries something different,"This album is unlike the previous two: Penetralia and Osculum Osbcenum. There is a lot of experimenting going on here and they stray from their classic death/black metal style. There are keyboards and some really slow, boring songs on this one. Maybe this is what fans of newer Hypocrisy like, but for someone like me, who heard Penetralia when it first came out, this album is not worth the money."
5,Sci-Fi Must See,"I am so happy the wait is over and it was well worth it. I get more out of it each time I watch it. It is one of those movies. If you're a sci-fi fan, then I would recommend this Shatner does this movie good playing himself. And you'll want to check out the dvd features to help complete the movie."
4,Funny but not the life changing ordeal others make it out to be,"There were good parts to this movie, but overall I wasn't that thrilled with it. The whole rap thing at the end everyone raves about was not that funny. I did like Shatner however and found him to be honest and realistic in his portrayal."
2,I've met the stars and still the movie wasn't great.,"I met the stars before the movie released, and though I love each of them individually, this movie was clearly a couple of guys having fun with the ""big"" camera. I loved all the sci-fi quotes and even found myself catching a mis-quote. I loved Bill Shatner. He helped create most of his character and in the end the movie was nothing like the original scriped. (that was unfortunatly a good thing)"
3,affectionate and funny but overlong,"Two middle-aged LA Trekkies have trouble finding love until they begin to take some advice from their idol William Shatner and let love in. The two leads are likable, but Shatner is hysterical in this affectionate look at the fans obsessed with all things Trek.DVD extras include commentary with the writer and director, a making-of featurette, deleted scenes, screen tests, a guide to terminology, a music video, trivia subtitles and more.The film is a bit long and doesn't always shift between buddy picture and romantic comedy smoothly, but it is fun and especially worthwhile for Trek fans. Lots of fun!"
1,Caution - Defective DVD's,"I am really unable to rate the movie fully since the DVD does not play past Chapter 20. I have tried this on my computer's DVD-ROM and on a Sharp DVD player, and neither will play past Chapter 20. I have written to Mindfire Entertainment for a replacement copy but have heard nothing from them. After I thought it was only my copy, a person on a Trek newsgroup wrote that he had the same problem with the Free Enterprise DVD. While the DVD seems to have a lot of extras, it also seems to have bugs so that it does not play on some DVD-ROM's and DVD players, so CAVEAT EMPTOR."
2,Amateur hour,"A rip-off of Swingers and Kevin Smith movies. It's painfully obvious from the director's and writer's commentary that these guys know nothing about making films or storytelling. One is a bad film editor and the other writes comic books and ""Star Trek"" journalism. Very little was actually funny, and the drama was filled with false notes and awkward dialogue. Go rent/buy Swingers or Chasing Amy instead!"
1,"Only watch this movie if it is truely ""free""","The documentary extra of ""Free Enterprise"" makes it clear that the filmmakers thought they were making a romantic comedy about two science fiction fans who meet their idol, William Shatner. Unfortunately, the film is neither romantic nor comedic. At best, ""Free Enterprise"" could be considered a bad, 1990's, autobiographical, Woody Allen movie with all of the angst and none of the humor. It isn't even a story about science fiction fans who meet meet their idol. That, as ""Galaxy Quest"" proved, has great fodder for gentle humor. Speaking as an SF fan myself, these soon-to-be 30 year-old boys are just neurotic, self-absorbed teenagers, not people who revel in fantastic possibilities. Speaking as a psychologist, I'd make a perfect therapist for these two, thoughts I'd rather not experience when I'm looking for some entertainment."
1,A Bomb,"5 Stars Ha! Are the reviewers all friends of the directors? Sorry, I thought it was a bomb. I just thought it did not work at all. Save your money and buy some real StarTrek DVDs because there is nothing here for StarTrek fans here. This is the last time I buy a DVD going on the reviews. :-(Hey I found a good review of this movie -- quote: ""A horrible, unwatchable piece of garbage"". I 100% agree."
2,"Don't Bother - see ""Trekkies"" instead","Two rich, successful, sexually voracious Jewish Trekkies have trouble with their love lives and meet William Shatner...The film has enough clever references to obscure sci-fi films (and even an old Yes album) to keep the nerds happy, but I could not identify with anyone in the film. William Shatner reciting Shakespeare along with the worst rapper I ever heard did not endear me to the film.If you're not Kosher, you may wish to skip this one."
4,LOGANS RUN ?,"Very funny movie and you dont have to be a trekkie to enjoy it. I watched it just after seeing a Shatner biography on Star channel (an embarassing admission ), which probably made it even funnier. Just one additional point to make- Logans Run was a really really bad movie, despite the presence of Jennie Agutter.In fact its in the ""its so bad its good "" category. Micheal York must cringe every time he thinks of it."
3,Not what I expected,I would have expected more of Shatner. But it was watchable. I probably would not buy it again if I had already seen it.
5,The role Bill Shatner was born to play,"I wouldn't call Free Enterprise high art, but I'm going to give it a 5 anyway. Its, kind of a geek fantasy movie. Two long time fanboys meet William Shatner only to discover that he is an absolute doofus. They're worlds are shattered. Its easily Shatner's best role ever.Its not the best plot in the world, parts of the film are poorly timed, but I've watched it 3 times now, and I never get tired of it. Sometimes, its ok for a movie to just be fun.If nothing else, see this for the special features. There are more extras on this disc than you can shake a stick at. The terminology commentary and the glossary are particularly excellent."
1,Worst dialog I've ever heard...,"Not funny, not sweet, not well written.... Lacks drama, conflict and competent acting. Every character speaks the same. Truly horrible."
4,Beam up for this ENTERPRISE,"William Shatner has done the ultimate parody of himself in Free Enterprise. The script takes satire to the max as Shatner plays an actor name William Shatner. He also sends up Star Trek and SF conventionsPre Will & Grace Eric McCormick and Rafer Weigel play two best friends who look up to Shatner as a mentor...and they find he is a real personFor those fans of the Star Trek genre, this is almost as funny as Clerksgo get this one!Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
5,Excellent Service!,"The product came very fast! It was in great condition and it was what I expected! When I needed to return it, the seller contacted me immediately with an RMA number and return labels! The process was simple and quick!"
3,Oldman is brilliant,"Gary Oldman becomes whatever character he plays, be it Emmett Foley here, Beethoven, or Count Dracula. He is always totally believeable. Pamela Martin is also quite good in her roll as his sister Earlene, but Francis McDormand, a normally adept actress, seemed wooden and uncomfortable as his wife Mae Foley. Beyond the performances, however, the movie seems like a series of unrelated vignettes. You just know that a lot of it must have ended up on the cutting room floor. The pace is so slow that only Oldman's performance maintains interest for long periods. The ending comes off like a last-minute cut-and-paste job to give the movie a bit of a happy ending. How historically accurate it is I cannot say, but Chris Calhoun, the real-life basis for Emmett Foley, says about 60%."
1,Not airtight,"I gave these four stars initially because they were cheap, did the job, and seemed to hold up pretty well despite being thin. However, these are not airtight as the description states which pretty much renders them useless. I used these to store flour, rice, cereals, and pet treats and all of the cannisters ended up with bugs in them. A lot of stuff to throw away. You're better off saving money in the longrun by spending more money upfront on better containers."
3,WEIRD TOPS!,"THE CANISTERS ARE CUTE AND THE BIGGEST TWO ARE THE RIGHT SIZE, BUT THE TOPS ARE ***WEIRD*** AND SOMETIMES DON'T FIT. PLUS WHEN WASHING THEM (THE TOPS) THE WATER STAYS IN THEM. I DIDN'T KNOW AT FIRST THAT THE TOPS COME APART-WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? AND WHY? ANYWAY CUTE THOUGH THEY MAYBE, I THINK I'LL TRY SOMETHING ELSE."
1,Don't buy these.,"I was originally going to buy ClickClack (made in New Zealand) storage containers. To save money I bought these (China-made) containers instead and it was a big mistake. The first bad sign was a long black hair stuck in one of the containers. The soft plastic parts of the lids that seal the containers had rough edges and were poorly trimmed. The clear plastic of the containers had all sorts of scuff marks. The final straw came when I dropped one from about 3 feet and 3 inches of the lip broke off, rendering the container useless for airtight storage -- and that's assuming that the somewhat loose-fitting lids actually make the containers airtight. If you want containers like these, spend the money on ClickClack or some other quality brand. I'm surprised Target sells these at all."
3,Mixed review,Was delivered quickly. Quality was just OK. Would have preferred a better seal. I purchased a similar project in Detroit with a better seal.
2,Poorly made but works,"Not an OEM fit and has to be more or less forced into place. Appearance was not a big concern on my old, rusty Civic so for the price I suppose I don't have much to complain about. If you want quality go with the original Honda part but if you are just looking to keep an old rusty car street legal and don't mind the possibility of having to zip-tie things into place, then this part was made for you."
4,Death metal EP with some exclusives,"Swedish death metal band Dismember is one of those bands you can always count on. They always deliver brutal death metal tunes without the slightest hint of change, progression or awareness of trends. They don't do nu- and they don't do -core; they're a death metal band, plain and simple.1997's Misanthropic EP served as a warm-up to the band's appropriately-titled full-lengthDeath Metal. The title track appears on the Death Metal album, but the remaining four songs are exclusive to this EP. They're all in the same brutal, yet slightly melodic, death metal style, and are all really heavy and really good. Of particular note is the band's version of Autopsy's ""Pagan Savior"".Misanthropic works pretty well as a low-cost introduction to Dismember (it was how I first heard the band), but it's mainly an EP for serious Dismember fans who want to dig deeper into the band's catalog."
5,Great,"Your toddler will enjoy it and you will too - teaches good lessons such as sharing, playing nice, safety."
4,Great video for kids,"Ordered this for my 2 yo for Christmas. He's a big Handy Manny fan and these are really cute episodes. He gets his little tool box out and plays along 'fixing' up things in the room. The center plastic piece that holds the DVD in place was broken, but the DVD was not damaged, so that's why only 4 stars. Otherwise a good buy, quick shipping."
4,Over Europe,"Great book. Wonderful and creative pictures from all over Europe. Germany didn't get as much treatment as I was expecting, but still great. Seller was way to optimistic in the description of this particular copy."
5,Great recipes from the past!,"I was visiting with a friend and browsed through her copy of this ""long ago"" cookbook. When I returned home I ordered it right away."
3,"good wizard verus bad wizard, the sequel","Writing this kind of stuff must get boring:visualizing all those head splitting and suchand then figuring out how to bridge into the next sequelafter the current villains heads are split?What got me as I finished this was that the wizardCadderly thought of a way to destroy the whole castle withouthaving to risk battle afterwards...not that it wouldwork by his god's rules of magic.We have dragon battles and a lot of giants, goblins and other beastiesthat his traveling troop fight.So the adventure martial arts descriptions go on and on:makes one miss the writers who don't take themselvesso seriously? I'm going to call this kind of stuff B fantasyas a category, because this just isn't A quality writing?"
4,Very Enlightening,"Before reading this book, I did not know the difference between a buccaneer and a pirate. I thought they were one and the same. Thanks to Marrin, I now understand the difference.With so little known about Captain Morgan before he made a name for himself as a buccaneer, I believe Marrin does an excellent job in setting the scene by describing the world Morgan lived in. Without going over-the-top, he adequately describes the political and social scene of the day however fair or unjust it may have been. He also gives a good impression of the many injustices that were accepted as part of everyday life that are very difficult for us to comprehend today (e.g., slavery, torture, terrorism, etc.).After reading this book, I understand why Morgan was hailed as a hero in England at the time, but it is also very clear why the Spanish compared him to the Devil."
5,Makes you a little more interesting.,"If you aren't very smart, don't know how to start a conversation, or better yet take a long time in the bathroom you need this book. It is filled with facts that you want to know not facts that you could care less about (not completely true since there are some stupid stuff but you aren't forced to read it). Did you know that more people have seen David Copperfield perform live than any other performer in the world. Or did you know that blue birds cannot see the color blue. Give this book a try. I love this book because knowing random stuff is always good to know."
4,Great book. Brilliant concept. lol,My better half spends a lot of time in the 'library' so this was the perfect addition to his reading material.Love it!
3,misleading marketing,"The product itself is really nice, new in good condition, shipped fast, but this is not, as Amazon and JoJa Electronics leads you to believe on the page itself, a zip disk holder. This is a media holder for flash cards and nowhere on this page is this indicated (except for now I guess that I'm writing this).After sending four emails and one fax to JoJa Electronics they finally responded by saying there was nothing they could do about it. Oh well."
4,A definite tool needed in a budding journalist's toolbox!,"The book was thorough and efficient. The cases are challenging but are given to expand and open a journalist's mind ethically. The commentaries help the reader sort out what they just encountered while it presents all sides of a possible ethical decision. The commentaries doesn't demand that the reader take on a certain ethical decision, but instead produce options that exercises the student's mind. Literally, a reader's brain will hurt after closing this book. However, it's a good thing, the book works to produce ethically thoughtful journalists who will venture out into the field. It is a book I plan on keeping on my shelf, while keeping it's teachings in the back of my mind."
3,Ok Player,This product looks and sounds great. Only if someone can get their hands on it. Everyone should cancel their order so I can get mine first. Thanks
1,A Zero if An Option,"Where are these stupid things that were supposed to be out two months ago. The Microsoft Ipaq- oops I mean Compaq Ipaq is a tiny (ha ha) bit late to market with a bunch of hoopla. And by the way who do the rest of you reviewers work for: Compaq, Intel, Mighty MS, or a sub-contractor for any of the above comnpanies. Why can't I buy one of these stupid things. Compaq is using some rather stupid marketing tacktics- design the ideal handheld and then withold it from the market until another company can actually manufacture it and put it on the market and saturate the customer base. Sony says thanks you stupid Americans. If both become available at the same time, I will certainly not buy the much later than promised Ipaq. I am sick of checking Amazon and numerous other sites for one to become available. I encourage others who share this sentiment to similarly protest by refusing to buy the Ipaq."
4,Good product but still not as easy or intuitive,"If you like great color and graphics as well as built in MP3 capabilities, then this is the right hand-held product for you. However, if you like things simple, get a Palm. While I love this product, it is not as easy to use as a Palm (I have a Visor). The visor is a bit easier to use. The only problem is that unless I get external modules, the Visor does not match (not even close) to the capabilities of the base model of the iPAQ. The problem with the Win CE operating system (or whatever they call it these days) is that it is based on MS Windows and it is a bit awkward to access some of the functions or programs. I will continue to use my Visor for business and the iPAQ for ""fun."" I also wish that Compaq had gone with the AA or AAA batteries instead of a proprietary option because I have a AA/AAA recharger at home. The battery life of the iPAQ does not make extended use very good...especially for strenuous use...e.g. playing MP3's."
1,rip off,"the person did not say it was a ripoff the screws was missing ,and i still was not able to turn it on and set it up plaese do not send me a request review on this i am very angry the indivindual did not put details on the product summary thank alot sir i hope you enjoy the ripoff items you try to sell ..Compaq iPAQ 3650 Color Pocket"
1,Buyer beware! Serious quality issues,"The Ipaq has serious quality issues including dust under the screen (!!), problems with the stylus housing, and problems with some of the buttons. Compaq customer service also suffers, no doubt due to the back log of complaints on the Ipaqs already in the hands of consumers. My advice is simply not to buy one of these. Take a look at the Casio models instead. They're high-quality machines and beat the Ipaq in several areas, including screen quality, sound quality, and, most importantly, manufacturing quality...."
3,Great toy but check sync for business use,"Great high end toy with great screen. If you want to read your work email on your pocket pc, dont bother unless you use MS outlook at work. Bought it yesterday, and tried to sync with my Eudora email at work. NO third party software is available to sync Eudora on the desktop with outlook on the pocket pc. Eudora has no plans to support anything other than Palm OS. Microsoft has no plans to support sync with anything other than outlook. Palm OS cant read attachements(excel,word,etc), so decide between 2 evils before you buy."
3,Problems synchronizing under Windows 2000,"The machine and screen are beautiful. Fast and responsive. The addition of case (which is mandatory in order to protect the screen) makes fitting the unit in a shirt pocket difficult. No built-in expansion.A previous Amazon review stated that ""The USB connection on Windows 2000 is a bit finiky."" I have experienced major problems under Windows 2000 using the USB docking station -- it got worse and worse to the point where I can no longer sync at all. This feels like a software issue involving the included Windows sync software, as the sync software now reports that the USB port is not available. Maybe Intellisync 3.7 is the cure (if anybody knows the answer to this, please report it)."
4,Just short of perfect.....for now.,"I finally traded in my Palm V when I (finally) got my hands on the IPAQ. Unfortunately, I discovered Compaq does not offer a wireless (without phone line attachment) accessory like they lead you to believe. I am bummed. When I called Compaq, they lead me to Sierra Wireless, where I learned the only wireless solution costs [a lot]. Hello! What was Compaq thinking? If all owners refer to their cd-rom that comes with your IPAQ, you'll notice the misleading 'expansion pack' demo that actually shows a 'wireless' expansion pack that has yet to exist. (It looks like a larger pack with a small antenna on top). Other than the major dissappointment, a fine piece of hardware in every way, shape and form."
2,Palm II or V vs. Compaq iPAQ H3650,"I'm an x-Palm user, had three versions of Palm by choice, all worked wonderfully, never had a problem, support was great! Bought a Compaq iPAQ 3650, wanted to try the ""latest"" PocketPc. Might be this year's worse mistake. Within one month, I've experienced hardware and software failures and an apparent lack of concern by Microsoft AND Compaq.Recent inquiry re: software failures including inaccurate info reflected on ""Today"" screen (future dates data presented as currenct schedule) and other software failures resulted in the following comment from Compaq: ""...back up all of the data on the unit (because this will erase everything) and turn the unit off, using the switch on the bottom, and then back on. That may fix some of the problems you are having."" No further suggestions or offers of assistance were offered.I can't wait for Palm to release an updated version. It will provide me with an excuse to convert back to Palm."
2,Compaq Customer Service terrible,"I bought my Compaq Ipaq and the Rhinoskin Rhinopack 2000 case at the same time. After using both for about 3 months, I dropped the Ipaq with the case on it accidentally! Both the screen and body cracked and Compaq would not replace it for a lesser cost than buying a new one! So, I bought a Palm Vx and I'm much more satisfied than before!"
3,Available soon... When?,"This is starting to look like a typical MS-Windows release. First, Compaq said that the new Ipaq Pocket PC will be released on June. Then, it was announced to be released on July 1st. Then, early July, then, July 15th. So today it's July 24th and it is still unavailable. I've been to Europe and I looked for it on-line as well, nothing. And the Compaq site says: ""Available soon..."" -- yeah, right! At this rate, there would be newer and better models before I will ever get my hands on the H3650/H3600/whatever..."
3,Love the concept and loved the product,"But after several months of owning it, I am noticing some things I don't like.Pro's:Pocket PC operating system is wonderful. It is just like Windows and has everything Windows has to offer in a little tiny version. I am a programmer, and love the ability to connect to databases with this productMP3. What else do I need to say about that?? Wonderful!Document Library: A specially designated place tos tore eBooks was a wonderful idea!Screen: Crisp and clean. Perfect clarity, much better than the Sony's.Con's:Battery Life: Very short. I need to recharge fully every night and do a restore as the battery dies throughout the day.Size: Very bulky. In today's marketplace I find it hard to believe this model cannot be more compact. Warning: This BARELY fits in the Coach mini-office.Lack of accessories: Try to find a hardcase for this model. Yikes! Without it, your iPaq will turn on on its own, draining the battery even more."
4,iPAQ - Not perfect but closest yet,"After deciding that the PocketPC platform is the best PDA device that integrates with my Win desktop platform, I had to choose between 3 different vendors models. An in-store test of performance showed iPAQ far and away faster than its PocketPC competitors. It also had speaker volume that was able to get my attention. This was important since my Palm Pilot was basically useless to notify me of meetings since I seldom could hear its alarm. Things to note about the iPAQ are it's fixed battery. If you need something to go many hours between charges, it may not be for you. It's display is the best for reading outdoors and in bright light but may not be quite as brilliant indoors. But still outstanding compared to my Palm.I highly recommend iPAQ if you can find one."
5,This beats palm with a stick!,"This unit puts both handspring and palm units to shame! More features, better features, and beautiful screen. Bottomline this is the best Pocket PC best handeld ..... hands down! Get one of these at any cost!"
5,I own it and love it!,Its a great deal! Comprable to the 3700 Series when you buy the Pocket PC 2002 Upgrade off of Compaq.Com
4,solid,"can't say i hear any robert pollard on this record, but lots of other influences. i get a very strong early kinks and the wrens whenever i put it on. definitely is rooted in the 60's, and i might add, sometimes teeters on hokey in the later tracks. ""ain't it good to feel love"" is a beaut."
3,Not bad.....,Pretty good for a small compilation.. a good starting point if its your 1st Twins Purchase.I was owever expecting the *Single Version* of Hold Me Now but at least its got the Single version of let loving start. other than that its just a couple of b-sides and album mixes.
4,Good,"The product is well manufactured. However, the zippers are not very strong. I have a very lively a 18 months old that managed to damage the zipper with some pressure to the side."
3,Single parent G-man,"This contempory novel set in Colorado answers a question: ""Is it possible to have romance, intrique, murder, mystery, and a soccer team of 6 year old girls all in one story?"" Bill Ellis says yes because he did it & did it well. The plot and sub-plots mix well as he tells of a Secret Service Agent coping with his job while recovering from the tragic death of his wife. The action & romance blends well."
2,wet = corrosion,The product works fine but is susceptible to corrosion very quickly. This is the third one I have gone through in 2 years. The most recent lasted about 6 months. Unfortunately it is located in a locker that gets wet constantly. If it was in a dry area I would expect better results. I have moved on to a different sytle of plug that is more protected from the elements (and costs 3 times as much) and so far so good.
4,Cars game is well liked by my 3 year old,"I wrote this review because I did not think this game should be rated so low. My son picks Cars to play everytime we get Vsmile out. I like it because he is able to drive a car on the road with out the difficulty of bigger systems or arcade games. He is learning while he is playing, too."
2,Boring.,My 4yr old daughter finds this game very boring. She hardly ever picks it out to play. When I have sat down to play it with her I have found it quite boring as well. Maybe it is more suited for a boy.
4,"Hip, yet comfy","Hey, I won't lie. I like hip shoes. However, my feet don't have the best arches. And while these shoes look like your average hipster lowtops, they provide much more support, arch, and comfort that something like an adidas shell-toe or Converses.I've got a pair of black-reds, and received complements on them.Just bought a pair of ""elephant"" colored ones, and they fit great.I was suprised to see that there are far more colors available here than at the Puma store on Market St. in San Francisco."
4,Love This!,"We love this, more for the workout ability. It is a fun way to get a good workout and play at the same time. Our family loves it and any friends we show it to love it. Probably more geared toward adults for workouts and fun."
2,Toy not what you think,"i got this toy for christmas. i wanted it so bad. but when i got it, it was so not what i expected. You have to go through training first until you can even play the real game! and you have to get a certain score just to advance and play the real thing. Its no question that Prime Entertainment really blew it on this toy.Bad features:game sensor hastrouble picking up your actions,have to go through trainingjust to play the game."
4,IM A PRO BOXER AND THIS IS WHAT I THINK ABOUT IT,"1ST YOU MUST HAVE NEW BATTERY'S FOR THIS GAME UNIT TO WORK CORECTLY.WITH NEW BATTERY'S I EASYLY PASSED THE TRAINING STAGE AND BEAT THE CHAMP THE FIRST FIGHT AND I AM STEADLY INPROVING MY PUNCH CONECT RATIO.IF YOU ARE NOT IN SHAPE YOU SOON WILL FIND YOUSELF BREATHING HEAVY WITH THIS GAME.THIS GAME IS WORTH THE PRICE LOTS OF SWEATY FUN.OTHER REVIEWS ARE WRITEN BY UNPATIANT KIDS WITH OLD BATERY'S .TAKE YOUR TIME PRACTICE AND YOU BETTER HAVE A QUIK MEMORY TO MEMORIZE PUNCH COMBO'SOH THERE IS NO FOOT WORK IN THIS GAME JUST STAND STILL BLOCK,JAB ,JAB RIGHT (OR STRAIGHT RIGHT)LEFT HOOK RIGHT HOOK LEFT UPERCUT RIGHT UPERCUT.IF YOU WONNA BEAT THE CHAMP JUST JAB HIM WHEN HE STARTS TO PUNCH!!!THEN TRY TO FOLLOW IT WITH A RIGHT HOOKOR ANY COMBO.AND TIME YOUR BLOCKS DONT BLOCK EARLY"
1,Only because I like Ashley Judd...,"I like all kinds of movies, and especially the ones that make you think after they're over. All through this movie, I kept trying to 'get it,' and then when it was almost over, I thought to myself, ""When it's over, I'll get it.""HA!The only reason I gave this 1 star is because it has Ashley Judd in it. And giving her the 'star' for this film is stretching it a bit.UGH."
4,Focused,FocusedMy boyfriend and I disagree about this movie. He believes that the detective/PI was actually her long lost father. I don't see how he came to that conclusion but my view is that he was trying to make up for loosing his daughter many years before and would go to any length to protect her from herself. I have to watch it again to catch the things that I missed the first time. I found it profoundly disturbing and I like it for that reason.
1,"Wish I could ""unwatch"" this one","I was warned not to watch this film because it was so bad. I ignored the advice, and now I too am left with a desire to delete the experience from long term memory. A truly weak plot that is helped along by some atrocious directing.If you're looking for Ashley Judd, go see Double Jeopardy. If you want a British spy-thriller, James Bond does it right. If it is k.d. you're craving, go get a collection of her music videos. And Jason Priestley fans, you're stuck with 90210 re-runs."
1,Scary! Wish my mom had picked me up,"I went to see this with my girlfriend. She would probably have kicked my --- well all my conjunctions --- if I hadn't gone. Gee I wish she had just gone to see it with her jock girl buddies instead. Because the heroine of this movie is even scarier that any of those girl jock buddies. Why, Joanna Eris, the heroine of this scary movie just goes around killing every guy she meets. I got scared. I snuck out, telling my girlfriend I had to go to the little boys' room. But really I called my mom on my cell phone and said, ""Mom, can you come get me? I'm scared"". When my girlfriend drags me to flicks like this, I want to break up with her. But I can't. She'd probably make like Joanna Eris and stab me if I tried. Why do movies get made about anyone like Joanna Eris? I vote someone just push Joanna Eris in front of a school bus instead!"
1,ASHLEY JUDD PLAYING THE DEVIL?,"Gee, I just had an awful thought. What if I had just landed on a spaceship from Mars, and I saw EYE OF THE BEHOLDER as my introduction to movies? Then suppose someone were to ask me what movie star I like best. I would have no answer to give exept K.D Lang! In this movie movie she keeps it all together while trapped in a twilight zone in which the world might as well be one big institution for the criminally insane, for all her contact with it goes. Yes, a movie that can make K.D. Lang look good compared to the rest of the cast is quite an accomplishment. Still, it is a losing battle. Despite her touch of sanity, sitting through EYE OF THE BEHOLDER is qutie an accomplishment too."
1,Worst movie for the year 1999/2000,The only thing more tortureous would be to watch 2 hours of baby seals being clubbed to death.
1,What a bag of crap...,"This had to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The worst part of this movie were the woefully undeveloped characters of McGregor and Judd. McGregor's character has some sick and strange obsession with Judd's serial killer. The man lost a daughter. So what? This does not explain the reason he follows Judd around during the entire movie. He protects her several times throughout the film but he also nearly Kills Her! Judd's black widow serial killer is never really explained well either. Was she sexually abused, did her mommy hit her and call her names? Any thing that could have explained her character's reasons for being who she was were left out. McGregor and Judd were not to blame for this. Their performances were the best they could have been for this trainwreck. The fault for this disaster lies with the director and writer who translated this story film. With a better director and writer this might have been a taut psychological thriller."
1,Skip it,"First, let me say I'm a Ewan McGregor fan and it pains me to find fault with any of his films, but this one is a stinker. To those who feel you must be intelligent to appreciate this film I say: I have a law degree and I couldn't begin to tell you what this movie is about. Furthermore, anything you have to watch 4 times to understand is not a good movie and certainly doesn't deserve an Oscar much less your valuable time. A good director will not make it so painfully hard for anyone to try and figure out what they just spent two hours watching. I like intrigue and suspense as much as the next person, and I even like endings that are open to interpretation. This movie, however, is not satisfying in the least. It was slow, choppy, lacking in any attachment to the two lead characters and a basic waste of time. My advice is to skip it and find a movie with a real story."
1,This movie refutes its title,"I love arty, convoluted films (Mulholland Drive, Memento, etc.) but this movie is just drek. I cannot comprehend how someone as talented and unimaginably beautiful as Ashley Judd deigned to be in this piece of ... whatever it is. It defies description. Even the prospect of seeing Ashley nude again hasn't led me to watch this a second time."
4,"Odd Story, Both Visually & Audibly Entertaining","Here's an extremely stylish, different film panned by almost all the professional critics which means here's another example of why they should be ignored. You are better off reading the reviews of people here at Amazon.Being one who appreciates stylish film-making, I thoroughly enjoyed the images and the sound on this movie. I found it absolutely fascinating. Being a male, it doesn't hurt that Ashley Judd stars in it, either.To be fair, I can see where the story would turn off a number of people.The co- lead, Ewan McGregory's character, is odd and not very credible. k.d. lang's character is unlikable, there is some stupid numerology as part of the story and the ending is unsatisfying .Yet, despite the above, the story is very involving and the visuals and sound (5.1 surround) are just so good that they way outweigh the negatives.The movie flat-out entertains, which is the name of the game."
1,What?,"I wanted to like this movie. I enjoy Ashley Judd in her other roles, and well, Ewan McGregor, they don't get much better, but...What was this? The problem starts immediatly when they don't tell us anything about the charachters, but we are supposed to feel something? You just don't care, because you know nothing about them. For 1 hour and 40 minutes, I kept saying ""It's got to get better"". Never did. Sill love Ewan, but pick your roles more carefully!"
1,"Awful, awful, awful!","Oh good lord - did I actually sit through that whole thing? This movie makes me wish there was a ""0"" star rating. Can I have my 4 bucks back please? Better yet, I'd like the 2 hours of my life back. What a waste! Ugh!It was a movie that aspired to better things, but failed miserably. Hitchcockian in its inspriation, but amateurish in its execution. McGregor and Judd do their best in an otherwise mess of a movie. No wonder this thing sat on a studio's shelf for so long without a distributor!I wish I'd read the reviews BEFORE I watched the movie."
4,A Favorite Film,I love this film. Most films I only watch once but this one I can watch many times. It has twists and turns that keep you coming back for more. Have been to one of the locations where a scene was shot.
4,Very suspecting,A surveillance expert is hired to follow a woman suspected of blackmailing the son of a government official. Then he discovers she may have been responsible for a series of murders spanning ten years.
4,this isnt as bad as other reviews make it seem,"Give me a break people. This movie was well done.The acting and production were both fine, likesome other reviewer mentioned (and yet that sameperson gave 2-3 star review??!?).The ending wasn't so ""BAD."" If you are one who MUST havea happy ending, then you might not like it, but thatdoesnt mean it's bad. Shit the ending is similar toSeven's (minus Brad Pitt and the gore;sorry for the spoiler),and yet that movie has a 4 1/2 rating on this site.I think itwas easy to connect with the characters emotionally andmaybe even have sympathy for their circumstances.The sad and perhaps inconclusiveness endingfits the story perfectly.4 stars for it being a better movie than most, 1 no-starbecause if you're not in the mood it might be a littleslow and disappointing."
2,Another stinker movie for Judd,"This movie was terrible. The plot really did not make sense and the acting was awful. If I were you, I would not waste my time. But if you must, watch it on HBO, ok?"
3,BEAUTY IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER,"Is it just me or do you hust want to strangle Ashley Judd's character. That is just one of the worst people I ever evr seen on a film. So if that was the meaning behind the character Ashley Judd did a great job. As far as Ewan Mcgregor goes he did an excellent job as the eye.As soon as he begins to track her he falls into a love/obbession with her.he even quits his job so he can countinue to follow her. He even saves her life an occation the best part comes when she is working in a dinner and the cops are on to her. Her teacher even sets her up, but lucky for her eye is there to save her again.The film it's self is some what of a strech, but writer/director Stephan Elliott did come up with a great consept thow. As far as the movie it's self he did a good job with it, not an award winner but good none the less."
1,A movie with so much potential wasted,"The movie began brilliantly. The cinematography and art direction are extraordinary. Unfortunately, it is all bogged down by an overly long storyline and an ending which will leave you with that ""I can't believe I watched the whole thing for THAT"" feeling. The performances were outstanding, but so many clues to future events that make the observer stop and take notice thinking ""I'd better pay attention -- this is going to mean something"" only to have them never materialize. So many original moments (particularly McGregor's imaginary conversations with his estranged daughter) and so much potential, wasted. What a shame. Watch it only for those original moments, but don't expect much else."
1,Don't waste your time,"The movie had some great screen shots, but watching a ""beautifully done"" movie cannot make up for the lack of plot and conclusion. The movie leaves the viewer asking, ""What exactly was that about?"""
1,what is this,"This is one of the most confusing, pointless movies that I have ever seen. Its about some spy that falls in love with a serial killer. When the end came, I was just like ""huh? "" with a bewildered look on my face. It really makes no rational sence and has little story line. This is not even worth a rental."
1,Infuriating,"Bizarre and disappointing. Everyone else has described the failures of this film, I will not. I will simply add this minor detail that to me speaks volumes concerning the futility of trying to comprehend the film or the character's motiviations: The red jacket. He's following her. Secretly. Doesn't want her to know. Spying. AND HE'S WEARING A BRIGHT RED JACKET THE WHOLE TIME. Get that? A BRIGHT RED JACKET. What? He's a spy and he wears a RED JACKET while trying to maintain a low profile? Truly unbelievable."
1,Very Bad--Truly,"I hate being negative about things, but this movie was truly awful. I am a very intelligent person and yet had hardly any clue what was going on because the movie was so unclear. The acting was okay, but not great and didn't make up for the film's poor quality. Unrealistic and undeveloped plot. Seriously . . . not worth seeing at all."
3,So much promise....,"..and such a disappointing ending.Reviewer: aralissia (above) from North Norway, pretty much said what I wanted to say.I was really intrigued from the start... the dark mood, the moody scenes, the scenic travels around the country... depicted by the little snow globes. The discussions with the not present daughter didn't really bother me much...it all looked like it would end in an enormously tragic climax.Then .... nothing.How DID IT end? Did they sit there, and froze to death and then sunk into the river, lake, sea, when the ice melted?Did anyone read the book? Is that how it ended?OK, I will order it....But this could have been a great movie.... lots of originality, until...Oh well, no need to repeat myself."
3,Eyes of Glass,"This is not a great movie, but it is well worth seeing. The performances are great and the cast is excellent. The production values are as good as any. It has all the parts needed to make an exceptional movie.If the ending was done better I think this would have been a hit. If you like movies like ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"", ""Taxi Driver"", or ""Eyes of Laura Mars"" you should enjoy it. Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor are quite good in their roles.This is not one I will watch as often as ""Along Came a Spider"" or ""Vertigo"", but I certainly added it to my collection of mystery/drama DVDs. Well worth at least a rental and if you like Judd you should seriously consider buying it."
2,Too confusing,"I must admit, I am a huge fan of Ewan McGregor and when I saw this movie for the first time I was hooked. But then I showed it to my friends and they weren't too happy with it. And then I showed it to my mom and she didn't like it either. The plot was too confusing. You have to know a lot of psychological stuff in order to understand this movie. When I watched it for the first time, I only watched it because Ewan was in it, but then I watched it a second and third time and I found it to be quite boring. The only part that I actually like(which happens to be my fave part)is when they sing that song ""I Wish You Love"" and when Ewan's ""in love with the wall"" so to speak. If you are absoulutely desperate and want to see a movie with Ewan in it, go see this, because that's how I was.(Also because my stupid Blockbuster didn't have any of Ewan's movies, preferably Nightwatch so I went to J.C. Flicks and rented this instead) Only rent if you are completely desperate."
2,what a disappointment!,"There's a big sucking sound and it's coming from this movie. By the time you reach the end of this one you'll be asking yourself, what happened? Kind of a hard to follow plot. Judd and McGregor are great as usual and even have interesting characthers.....too bad it was horribly written. Rent it before you buy!"
3,What's the Artist Name?,"I just viewed ""Eye Of The Beholder"" saturday May 27,1999.I liked the movie somewhat; but the plot needed more work.I really love the song titled ""I Wish You Love"". I really would like to know the name of that particular artist.The credits at the end of the movie are so small I couldn't tell who performed it.This song has been performed by many artist, but I really love the way it's sung by this particular artist. I think this song was the best part of the movie. If someone knows the artist's name, please email me at:johnl30@excite.com"
4,"A very interesting movie, quite unique.","Normally I don't care much for Mysticisme and I tend to dump any movie that tends in that direction, but Eye of the Beholder gets away with it very nicely. McGregor surpasses himself as the secret agent, haunted by the disappearence of his child who gets obsessed by e beautiful muderess (an equally good part by Judd). The story itself seems rather pointless in the beginning, but as the obsession starts to become mutual the bits and peaces fall nicely into place. Even if the end seems rather unlikely it has at least a ring of justice to it, which makes for a nice redeaming factor in story about people, who started out as lost causes. Stephen Elliott too is to be commended. Most directors loose their grip halfway through a somewhat mystic story like this, but he has managed to keep averything under control, right to the end."
1,Avoid.,"I JUST finished watching this one. I knew how it HAD to end. Too predictable. About half way into the movie I became grateful that I had earned it as a free rental. Not worth the renting price, in my opinion.No great effects for those with DVD players either."
2,Behold What?,"If it were not for Ashley Judd, I don't know if I would have rented it in the first place. She was, as always, very believable in her character. The filming of the movie was rich and vibrant. I don't think the editing gave you enough to go on to figure out the main character's ""hold"" on each other. Good acting...bad ending. You'll ask yourself what it all meant."
1,"Jumbled,pointless,mess","I just watched this movie last night and I was left wondering what just happened for the past two hours of my time. I watch alot of movies and enjoy complex, hazy storylines but this movie is terribly hard to follow. It reminded me of Eyes Wide Shut. Completely pointless and unenjoyable!"
4,Loved it!,"I loved the movie so much, that what I would like to know who is the artist singing I wish you love??? I wish you blue bird.....It's a woman.The movie was suspenseful and kept me hooked every step of the way! I've seen it several times.Please help me figure out who sings the song."
4,A media studies lecturer speaks,"Asthenic to some, it's eccentric directorial flourishes, vivid, encaustic photography and baroque isochronal plot twists soon yield to a captivating, inchoate charm. The 'eye' is the mirror to the childhood world of amoral absolutism against the adult 'other', the door to the past breached by the protagonists like vapour, which the ending signifies beyond it's touching exhortation, before it's closure to the harsh exigences of the adult world with a wistful poetry that commands obeisance beyond it's exiguous formalist structure.Also your girlfriend will go a big rubbery one like she did over 'Ghost' and 'Braveheart'"
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"I rented this movie because I like Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor, and the trailers made it look interesting. I am very sorry I did. This movie was choppy, hard to follow and uninteresting. I kept watching waiting for the movie to make sense, but it never did. Save your self the trouble and get another movie."
1,"Unanswered questions, misleading trailers","I have to agree almost totally with Robert Berry's review. While I myself found MacGregor's and Judd's performances solid, the entire movie, I kept asking myself ""Why?"" Why is MacGregor relentlessly pursuing Judd when, early on, he is ""ordered home"" to Britain to investigate a ""domestic problem"" there? What unrevealed information ties an internal investigator of the British consulate to this scheming American woman? And I always enjoy when the last line of a movie is delivered in such a whisper that you can rewind 8 times and still not know what was said. The trailers made this film look really intriguing; boy, were they misleading! I rarely feel like I want my money back for a video rental, but this one did it! Don't waste your $3.69!"
1,WHAT THE HELL?,"It's nothing but walking...left, right, left,...walking...left, right, left...Is my review boring to read? Well, appreciate it because now you've read the entire script for this thing.It boils down to this: If you want to see something so infuriatingly tedious and agonizingly boring that you have to turn off the VCR and watch Sesame Street for better character development (and overall plot), by all means, rent this sedative!"
3,"Interesting, yet lacking","Eye of the Beholder is about a private investigater who becomes obsessed with a woman serial killer. The premise is good, but we never really understand the motivation of either of the two main characters. Too many questions are left unanswered. A sense of true lonliness and desperation does come through somewhat, but not enough to save this movie. On the plus side the cinematogrophy is good, there's great music, and Ashley Judd wears some great clothes. All in all, though, the movie is unique and worth checking out and forming your own opinions."
1,"Mindless, pointless drivel....","I picked this up thinking that it might be the same caliber of movie as Judd's Double Jeopardy. It's not. Not even close. As the movies crawls along, many character developments, (or lack there of), are glossed over without ever being explained. It gets to the point where you don't know why they are doing what they're doing, nor do you care. Do yourself a favor and let this one sit on the shelf."
1,TERRIBLE,"You sit there and watch this thing waiting for everything to come together in the end. It never does! You would think after 100 years of movie making, they still wouldn't be putting out movies this bad."
3,Snow globes & love,"I came upon this movie by accident, one boring night on HBO, and I was immediately sucked in. This movie is only about love and all it's aspects; loss, obsession, euphoria, illusions, and ultimately it reflects pain, but what more should life hold for us but all of that..."
2,Be Warned--The Ending's Awful!,"I won't go into the ending on the off chance that somebody reading this review hasn't actually seen the movie yet (and will actually want to see it after seeing all the bad reviews it's got). However, the characterization is a mess, the motivations are hidden, the direction is cruel in the amounts it cuts from the storyline. Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor both give absolutely great performances (you can almost hear Judd pleading behind the scenes with the director, ""Can't I give it a little nuance, a smidgen of depth? Please? No? Okay...""). McGregor is one of my favorites and deserves major kudos for doing such a great job with a thankless script. Still, all their hard work doesn't even *begin* to redeem the time I lost watching this ridiculous film. (And, like many other people, I read the book after watching the film. Don't even try--you'll feel ripped off all over again.)"
2,"Good Story, Bad Execution","""Eye of the Beholder"" is the rare example of a ""bad good movie"". What I mean is that the story of a British secret agent (Ewan McGregor) pursuing and protecting a young woman, Joanna (Ashley Judd), who he is supposed to stop, has a haunting, well-written story, but the result on the screen can be uneven.The editing can be a bit dissorienting, but I found myself enjoying the acting and the smooth, dark look of the film. This film feels familiar --I'm sure I've seen something like this before, but I don't know where.If you can get past some of the noticable flaws, you might find yourself enjoying and admiring the effort that went into making one of the most noirish, twisted, emotionally-searching movies that you are ever likely to see. This film is definitely not for everyone -- or maybe not for anyone -- but it can be appreciated on several levels.It is worth a look with your beholding eye."
1,Much ado about nothing,"My fiance and I watched this disc, the whole time hoping that there'd be some explanation, some plot point, that would make all of the cross-country travel, wardrobe changes (and wardrobe oddities, like the red coat) and snow-globes seem worthwhile. The end reveals no explanation at all, just a take it or leave it, as-is ending. We'll be erasing the two hours spent with this disc, instead to place our high IQ's on better topics. Skip this one, please."
1,Worst movie I've seen in the past year,"A lot of bad movies have been released over hyped and over rated-but this is easily the worst of them. The story never really goes anywhere, which might work in a comedy--but this isn't a comedy. A great actor (McGregor) and a good actress (Judd) wasted in a horrible story. Alan Smithee could have done it better!!! Maybe it would have been better in Japanese, as I didn't understand it anyway. I watched this movie with my wife and my mother-and none of us could believe how bad it was. My daughter and her husband watched it later and felt the same. Five for five in the thumbs down department, and we all love watching movies!"
2,Actors good- movie bad,"As stated in the title, Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor are great at portraying their character, but the direction of the movie was horrible. It was very disappointing to see great performances by actors lost in a movie that seemed slapped together."
1,"'EYE' cant set sight, well enough.","EYE OF THE BEHOLDER, is the type of art film that tries despretley to be original, but in doing that messes itself up all together. Now i like Ashley Judd, i think she is a great actress, but i wonder why she would choose such a pointless movie, that only sees her as a demonic, and vengful, how should i put this, whore. Her and Ewan McGregor have done outstanding films in their time, but the chemistry and articulstion between the two goes nowhere, and nowhere fast. Katy Lang and Jason Preisley show up for no reason, except to seduce people's attention towards this unseductive film. I wish Judd would have put more time in to something that was actually worth watching. D"
1,Ashley Judd is only actor who can make kd lang seem wasted!,"I never would have expected kd lang to be an actor one would much be pulling for. But as a voice of reason trying to reign in the obsessive indulgence of ""The Eye"" (played by Ewan MeGregor), lang's character is the one we can most sympathize with herein. It might have worked to make lang look like a character actor to take note of. But what dooms it all to failure is Ashley Judd playing an absurdly extreme caricature of her already well-know ""ballbuster"" persona. As such the movie plays like a nightmare. Not in an entertaining sense, but as if the viewer is caught in the nightmare of having to watch the movie -- indeed a nightmare of living in a world where such a movie would ever be made and deemed entertaining. The mood is all totally putrid and the story beyond preposterous."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY...,"While boasting an excellent cast and an intriguing plot, this film simply tanks. Ashley Judd plays the role of a black widow, a female serial killer, who systematically kills off every man she meets. Ewan McGregor is the British intelligence officer who is hot on her trail. For some incomprehensible, mumbo jumbo reason, he ends up being protective of her.In fact, incomprehensible is a good way to describe this entire film. It is poorly edited and shuffles along at a snail's pace. Despite the excellent cast, the action plods along and the movie is dead before the first body hits the ground. One finds oneself having little sympathy or empathy for any of the characters in this cinematic fiasco. Do not waste you time or your money. This one is a turkey."
1,101 minutes wasted,"I only have 1,000 words to tell you how bad this is,and thatai'nt enough so i'll be brief. This movie makes flat out NO sense.Ewan Mcgregor(who's horrible)is watching Ashley Judd kill people.Why? I don't know.Why is she killing people? I dont know.What is Jason Priestly doing here? I don't know.Why did I waste my time? I don't know.Why does this movie exist? I DON'T KNOW! Should you(yeah you at the keyboard)waste your time? ABSOLUTELY NOT!"
1,"Awful, awful, awful....","Let's get the record straight first. Ashley Judd did this movie before Double Jeopardy and Ewan McGregor did it before becoming Mr. Jedi. That said, it still was an awful movie. The plot had potential but the terrible writing just gave no flow whatsoever to the film. No one explained the origins of McGregor's obsession with his target (Judd). And does anyone truly believe that the agency you are working for would allow one of their operatives to run off on your own crusade? Duh!...And the ending of the movie is even more incoherent. As the ending credits rolled on screen, I was left scratching my head, wanting 2 hours of my life back.You've been warned..."
4,I think it's a sad love story,"I like the movie. I like the theme song very much. Can somebody be so kind to tell me what the song title is? It has the lyrics of ""I wish you love ...."". My e-amil address is ""lin_teng@chicony.com"". I appreciate it if somebody knows the song and can tell me more about it."
1,Very confusing,"I am a great Ashley Judd fan, however, I had to read the reviews on this page to figure out what the movie was about. It was very confusing. I'm going to read the book. Maybe I can make heads or tails of it."
1,Can I have these 114 minutes of my life back please?,"This movie ranks right up there with ""Eyes Wide Shut"" as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I could not even begin to tell you what this movie was about...what is wrong with these people????"
1,Eye of the .... who?,"We rent a lot of movies and we usually pick the ones that have had gooed reviews ... boy, I wish we had read the reviews for this one before renting it. Can they possibly make a movie more pointless and meaningless than this one ... my guess it no."
1,Eye Of The Betrayer,I betrayed myself by keeping my buttocks stuck to the couch and my eyes peeled to the screen with hopes that this movie would get better. It just went on and on and on and on and it still didn't have an ending!
1,Dreadful,"Expert at surveilance....wears a bright red jacket the entire movie. Flies in helicopters, and beebops all over the US after breaking every protocol in his line of work (and should have the FBI and other assorted agencies all over him). She kills at least 2, maybe 3 men for no good reason and then becomes the perfect fiancee' for another. No explanation for these killings except a lame ""my daddy left me at Christmas"" plotline. The topper is when her childhood parole agent walks into the diner in Nowheresville, Alaska. What? And that doesn't even include the ""I wasted two hours of my life for that"" ending. The only reason this movie merits one star is because the two leads seem to be giving this their best effort. Save your money."
1,A waste of 2 hours.,I rented this movie because I like Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor. I am very sorry I did. The movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. Stay away from this movie. Buy Double Jeopardy instead.
1,I wish I had read the reviews before.,"Nothing saves this pretentious film. I heard some of the director's commentary that comes in the DVD so that I could be somewhat comforted with the idea that I had missed the point of the film... useless though. I didn't miss its point, it is just a mediocre, boring, non-entertaining film. I can't believe the guy at the video store recommended it... . I can't believe it, he must be a very sick person."
1,I wish the rating system had a zero star option!,"I was so excited. The movie had a great start. And then, the first murder was tension filled and shocking. But after that, the whole thing fell apart. I kept trying to figure out where this was going and in the end I asked myself, is that all there is! The central idea of the movie had so many possibilities that I feel were wasted. I was not impressed."
1,Please don't make the mistake I made,I rented this and was let down. The movie doesn't really build the characters so I ended up watching this spy following this woman and I really didn't care what happened. This seemed very shallow to me and didn't have any great romance or action to make up for lack of substance.
2,A puzzle with too many pieces missing,"This film has no plot and a senseless ending that resolves nothing. If I were Stephan Elliott, I'd be ashamed to admit that I wrote it. I'm a writer myself, and all writers know--or should know--that if you have to explain what you've written to your audience, you haven't done it right! In a sea of negatives, this film's only positive was Ewan McGregor, who was brilliant in spite of a script that was weak in structure, characterization and psychology. It was easy to believe that he was obsessed with her--it just wasn't clear WHY. Ashley Judd, normally an adequate actress, wasn't up to par this time around. Had ""Double Jeopardy"" not been released first, she might now be rehearsing ways to say, ""Y'all want fries with that?"""
4,well I liked it,"Of course I like Ashley Judd, and it was a good plot, well acted, good location shots- . An interesting pshological movie/ Better than most movies/ I do watch a lot of old movies and love them but this was entertaining and worth watching. Can' understand tyhe panned reviews- - this was better than the Tourist w/ Angelina Jolie and Johnnie Depp ( who is to die for wonderul & gorgeous). So I'll give it 4 stars for keeping me entertained."
1,Where's the rest of the movie?,"You'll find yourself asking this when this movie unexpectedly just ""ends"". I'm no movie cynic and I can usually find something to like in even the worst of films, but this one had the poorest, most bewildering ending I've ever seen. It made absolutely NO sense."
1,Don't waste your time,"Don't waste your time in buying, not what I expected... If you must rent instead of buying.."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"If I could, I would not give this film a single star, but that category is not an option. I went into this film wanting to like it. I've greatly enjoyed the actors in most of their other works - Ewan McGregor, Ashley Judd, Genevieve Bujold - and I assumed that with such a great cast, there'd be a great story. I hoped, I watched, and with each minute the story became progressively worse. I hung on til the better end, hoping that something would happen to redeem the characters and the actors who played them, but maybe that was the point - to see how low someone could go. It was terribly disappointing and depressing, and I wish someone would have told me about it before I took a gamble on it."
1,#1 on the Worst-Movies-Ever-Made List,Two talented actors in a horrible screenplay version of a once popular novel. It is the worst movie I have ever seen. Absolutely don't waste your money or time!
3,One saving grace.,"At first I thought this movie to be completely pointless. Then I realized that it does something that I'm sure none of the people involved intended to do. It shows a woman who was badly raised and abused but once she got into the hands of a psychologist she was turned into a psychotic serial killer. The psychologist even refuses to identify her to the police after this string of brutal murders. In a nutshell this movie depicts the actual result of psychological behavior modification techniques! If anyone doubts this statement one has only to read up on serial killers to discover that each and everyone only began their murder sprees AFTER receiving extensive psychological and psychiatric treatments. So, three stars for an accurate protrayal of the psychological profession."
2,"No Sorry, Better Movies Out There",I just wasn't a big fan of this movie. During there was some interesting action and I was always wondering if she really was killing all these people or was it part of his imagination like his daughter....I like endings that are clear and this one just wasn't the right ending for me.
3,"Good actors, bad movie","It was a little on the confusing side, but overall not too bad. Ewan McGregor and Ashley Judd gave great performances, but the movie just didn't make any sense. k.d. Lang was also very good."
1,I wasted $$$ on this stupid movie?,"This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen.Why the studio thought this would be a hit is beyond me.I don't understand why Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor even gave a thought in to making this movie.I kept hearing that this movie was very bad,but I didn't think it would be as bad as they kept saying. Avoid this movie at all costs.It is simply horrid."
2,Not worth two hours of your life,"Very odd movie with a weak story line. The only saving grace is the Hitchcock like camera work from time to time and the acting of a few key stars. The story rambles on, never really going anywhere, and then when its over, it leaves you with that ""Is that it?"" feeling. I really can't recommend this film at all."
2,BUMMER,I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT THAT WELL. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE DON'T REALLY LIFE THAT KIND OF MOVIE
1,1 star out of 4,"The Bottom Line:This depressingly-bad thriller spins its wheels in voyeuristic territory that has been covered better in a myriad of other movies--watch Rear Window, The Conversation, or even Disturbia before you watch this."
5,Misdunderstood Beauty,"After reading several reviews of EYE, I noticed a disheartening trend, people were simply not understanding any of it and that people were panning it without any logic whatsoever. The film is quite excellent in fact. First, the film is absolutely beautiful to watch and watching it in letterbox form is a must. Second, the plot is more than just some Private Eye falling in love with one of his assignments, it involves the complexity and dynamic of two deeply hurt individuals who need each other even though they have never spoken with each other. I won't go into much more detail because I know it is worth seeing so I recommend it to anyone who has cared about another person."
1,Too Thin..,"What a shame! It COULD HAVE BEEN a great film..You trust it gets better but after the first 45 min. you give up hope, at least I did. I think the actors are doing their best. However, the story is too thin, especialy the ending is disappointing."
1,This movie was horrible,"The plot went nowhere and made absolutely no sense at all. Why was he following her? What does his daughter have to do with any of this? I was waiting for some sort of ""breakthrough"" scene that explained everything and it never came. When it ended I said ""That's it?"" My husband summed it up very nicely though when he said ""I wish I could have that hour and a half of my life back."""
5,The Naked Truth,"A combo of hard rock and sweet tunes. Favorite song on album: Rikk James Kitte porn. There twist of funky rock combines to make a great album. These guys have a lot of talent and I would not be suprised to see them hitting it big very soon. - Darryl, the music Pimp"
4,This Record ROCKS!!!!!,I've listened to this record four times and I will definitely listen a fifth. A star for each listen!!!! The guitar work on this record is tight and in your face.Dryspell ROCKS!!!!!
3,Power Pop Pacesetter!,"In a world cram-packed with posers and flavors-of-the-month, these fellows appear to be the genuine item. Dryspell's songs are power-pop gemstones; riff-packed and ready for action - you'll be enthusiastically humming along the first time you hear them. Exciting guitar work and a rock-solid foundation make for a consistently enjoyable listen."
4,I had to buy this for school!,"I bought this book because I needed it for my class. It was a good class called Office Practice, and the book has very many helpful hints."
1,waste of money,the folks who write the good reviews about dvd's like this must either be the ones who make these poor quality dvd's or something. this dvd does have nude men but all the massage strokes are nothing ever used by true or even amateur folks- it was all just petting and light stroking- no sex instruction or erotic massage-should have sent it back. thumbs and everything else down.
2,This text and the software is loaded with errors!!,The concept of this book is excellent. The execution is absolutly horrible. The software is loaded with errors and I was unable to get in touch with the author to resolve the issues. I wasted considerable time in trying to use the text and software and I would not recommend this text!
5,Awesome!,"This book was truly a page-turner. I couldn't put it down, and if this is really T.E. Kendall's first novel then I'd like to know where's she's been all these years?<br /><br />This book made me laugh, cry, and praise her for her courage to write about something so profound in our day and age. The characters felt real, because their situations were real. It made me more aware that no one is above the hard knocks, and bad breaks of life, and I'd be surprised if this work doesn't reach the Best-Sellers List."
3,Great book,Very interesting storyline. Not your typical subject to write about but it was written very well. Could have gone into deeper detail on the main characters but was still a treat to read. I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to her next one!
1,Don't depend on this to start your car.,After about 2 years mine no longer holds a charge. Brand new it wouldn't start a dead battery in above freezing weather. Don't depend on this to get your car started in a jam. You will have more success push starting your car uphill.
2,Works fairly well for a year or so,In about 2 years the unit's battery failed to charge. The green light comes on and then goes back to red in about 10 seconds so basically a dead unit or a very expensive dim lantern. The light works on a low charge level. if you only need it for a short while and then plan to replace it might be worth 10 or 15 dollars new.
1,Earth in the Beginning,"I don't get why people say this book has scientific evidence. There are theories of what Eric Skousen thinks based on scriptures he has read, but there's absolutely no real science in this book.This book talks about planetary procreation, the fact that the supposedly omnipotent God ""messes up"" sometimes, and how earth was actually created in heaven and literally falls to it's current location when Eve eats the apple. Some of Eric Skousen's theories are interesting, but a lot of them, like the ones I just listed, are crazy."
4,Excellent source for all dog lovers.,"This is a very friendly book. It is bound very nicely and has an attractive cover with bright illustrations. It is large and would serve well as a ""coffee table"" book. The reading is easy and provides just enough information on each breed.The first section of the book is alive with pictures of various dogs and instructions from puppy care on through the life of a dog. It is well suited for a beginning dog owner due to its thoroughness and explanations of care. It is also a good selection to help you determine which breed is right for you.In contrast to other dog books we have seen, this one offers several photographs of most breeds. This is important. That cute puppy may grow to be one ugly dog.Overall, this is a very nice book that has proven itself to be informative and entertaining. Most of all, our kids love it!"
2,CAREFUL - DANGEROUS INFO,"Another book by the same writer ""The essential Dog Book"" has under ""Feeding Requirements"" the following statement. ""Very nearly every dog loves chocolate"". While true it doesn't go on to say that chocolate is DANGEROUS for dogs. I just called my vet and confirmed it. NEVER feed chocolate to your dog or cat no matter how much they like it. I cannot recomend any book by a writer that has such a dangerous error in it. It makes me wonder how well they researched and checked the rest of it. I don't know if this book also has this error in it."
2,disjointed and incomplete,"I found the section on breeds to be informative with nice pictures. The section on care and illness was severely lacking: on one page, the text just ended with no punctuation and did not continue to the next page. To find out how to take a dog's temperature was very clear, but I had to search the index to find out what that temp should be. There were instances that in case of an illness or infection, no real guides as to what the owner could do until the dog could see a vet. Just not very helpful to me at all."
3,A good dog book,"I got this book last weekend. I can't say I have read it cover to cover, but I have taken a good look at it.I like it!! ...I wont say the information inside it is very precise, especially concerning breed temperament, but the pictures are wonderful and give an excellent idea of what the dog will look like in real life.It is not a heavy book, and the language is very easy to read, so I also think its a good option for kids who are beyond the picture books and want a bit more information... without over saturating them!!"
2,not much information for the money,"I thought that this was an Encyclopedia but it was more just general information that anyone that has seen the dog would know, a big waste of money"
5,Awesome CD! GET IT! GET IT! GET IT!!1,"Once you pop in the disc, get ready for a sexy ride.It's Evanescence mixed in with eroticism.My favorite is ""I wanna be your God"", hear Luana's vocals word for word and listen.Pick up Metaphysical Attraction, you won't be dissapointed."
5,Girls Will Loove it!,"If you are a girl who have older brothers, and you need your questions answerd then you should read this book. Even if you do not have older brothers you should read it!"
1,How I Survived Reading This Book,"First of all, let me say, I didn't get the title. The book is just about a tomboy who does weird stuff with her neighbors. Like going up on roofs. Weird. And I was trying to put up with the book, because I like to give each book I come across a chance. But, I was on an AIRPLANE reading this. As if the flight is not boring and nauseating enough, the book made me fall asleep. I guess on the positive side, I got a good nap in before the plane landed.Please do yourself a favor. I know a lot of people enjoy this book, but ... I'm honestly wondering why. The ending had nothing to do with the story, not that the story was anything original."
2,Not worth reading,"I bought this book for our school library, but I never got too far--and rejected it. First of all, the main character gets away with a lot of ""crimes"" that I wouldn't want to encourage kids to do. Even her mother doesn't reprove her. Second of all, I don't want to encourage the names she calls her neighbors: Freeko and Fattabutta. And, third, I don't like having a book that jokes about ""Mary is going to strip!"" and girls being naked and Charlie being naked. Or about throwing booze bottles around. Call me square, but not in our school, no way!I had a 1997 edition and one thing was good: Old as the edition was, it still looked up-to-date."
5,Great,"This was a very good book. She is just like me but has way more fun.Wedelin Van Draanen should make another book about carolyn.and like call it ""being a girl isnt so bad"" or ""i thought beign a girl wanst so bad until now"""
1,Caution Do Not Read,This book is aweful. The author makes girls sound terrible and worthless. I do not think that ANYBODY would want to read this book.
2,A Child's Point of View,"I didn't like this book very much. To tell you the truth, I was kind of disappointed. I didn't associate with Carolyn at all and I don't recommend this book. If you want to read something by Van Draanen, I suggest the Sammy Keyes adventures instead. That's a girl with spunk!"
2,Age appropiate with a sexist message at the end.,"I am 20 and read this book for my adolescent literature class. The title just grabbed me. It seemed like preciesely the type of fare I read when I was young though now I can see the sexist implications. Why does Carolyn have to be more girlish? What's the matter with her being a tomboy? And growing out of it by gaining maternal instincts is really uncalled for. I had hoped such attitudes were left behind long ago. But I did enjoy the book anyway. It was quick and fun. It's like taking your kids to see a Disney film only your not watching anything and the images are much more amusing for it. Parents, if you have a problem with the possible sexist implications of this novel, mention it with your kids. If not, at least they're not watching T.V."
3,I just couldn't identify!,"This book might have been good, funny, and just a light summer book, but I couldn't identify with Caroyln at all. For instince, it seems like this book was set in a different time period, because the money the described that they thought was a lot, was only 50 cents. Plus, she was not very smart for her age, and the auther made her seem like she was 8, not 11. Kids now are pretty smart when they hit that age, they know lots of things. The thing is lots of authurs just don't know what kids know. This has been a problem I have came across in many books. Around that, this was a pretty Ok book."
1,Worst piece of garbage i've ever seen!!!,"FLIRT I was there for some of the filming,some of the girls left ,we were told Eddie Griffen was in the film when I asked eddie he knew nothing about this terrible cheap film 2hrs of hell, at the filming it was drugs and sex u either opened your legs to get into the movie ,I was out and running.I cant believe Amazon has it for sale or rent cheap junk"
1,Pain in the neck to set up and doesn't work outdoors. No audio.,"I tried this product with high hopes. Needless to say, I ended up hiring a company to come out and install a professional system for four times the cost. This system arrived in a plain brown box and with an instruction manual that was obviously used. I was dissapointed to receive a used/returned/refurbished product when I was told it was new. The video is of low quality with a very slow framerate. It was not clear at all. I love the wireless funtionality, pan/tilt/zoom, and overall design. The software was unnecessarily difficult to set up. I spent several hours just trying to figure it out. I did call their customer service and had a more than enjoyable experience in that regard. They were highly knowledgable about the product and happy to help. They did tell me it was okay to mount these units outdoors, eventhough everything in the manual said otherwise. Save yourself the time and effort, hire a security company to do the work."
2,internet capable security cameras,Extremely difficult to set up. Particularly for internet access. I still haven't been able to view all three cameras on one page. Plus I received a Costco circular with another manufactures device that has nine cameras including some that worked outdoors (Sony cameras) for not much more money and brand new as well.(The panasonic cameras can't be used outdoors) They couldn't possibly be more difficult to set up. Somehow that sounds like a better deal.
3,Doesn't work on XP.,"I'm sure this product would work just fine for my basic needs but I didn't read where it only supports W95, 98, NT, etc. and not XP. :("
2,Disappointed,"I am an avid reader and Grace Livingston Hill is among my favorite authors. I love her work, but was disappointed in this book. The characters were okay, but the plot could not hold my intrest. This was not one of her best works."
3,So-so,"This 1912 book is very similiar to 1920'sExit Betty. Major plot elements are the same in both books, but the later book is much more enjoyable because of the depth of the secondary characters, something that is left out of this relatively slight novelette.Tryon is a young man who encounters a mysterious woman at the train station. Although she is shockingly sans hat and refuses to share any details about herself, he determines that she is a real lady and resolves to help her escape peril. The course of true love runs relatively smooth despite a plot involving an evil cousin."
2,Plot details very confused,"If you like very old, silent movies, where the heroine is totally helpless unless the hero appears, etc, etc., you'll love this book. Unfortunately, the details of the plot in the first half of the book do not match the resolution of the mystery later on!! I won't give the ending away, although you can probably tell what it will be from the first page or so. Mrs. Hill wrote a lot of these books, all pretty much the same ""damsel in distress"" theme. And of course, it would be the horror or horrors to go out in public without your hat! :-) Those kinds of old details make the story fun to read; just don't pay too much attention to how everyone gets from A to B."
4,The Mystery of Mary,"Diana H. MYERS-- Grace Livingston Hil has written a novel filled with drama, suspense and romance. I couldn't put it down."
4,Exemplary,"The pace was quick, the plot didn't drag, and the storyline is interesting. I would read other books by this author."
3,Mystery of Mary,"This book takes place in the early 1900s, so you probably want to like that time period. It was interesting, but quaint."
4,Alwyn Crawshaw's techniques simplify your paintings,"I admire Mr. Crawshaw's techniques in many ways; he gives you methods to simplify how you paint people, boats and animals. He's known as an equestrian painter, so it's a bit disappointing that there isn't more in this book about painting horses (perhaps he's leaving that for a separate volume.) I also find Crawshaw's palette a bit dull--he goes for the natural look of muted greens and browns and blues--very realistic but not as exciting as the bright tropical colors that are now more in vogue in painting. This is in the true English tradition of watercolor. Nevertheless, I find that I've learned more by doing Crawshaw's exercises for painting things like trees and sheep than from many other books or videos. To rate this book; visually--it's not so exciting. Technique-wise, if you try out some of these techniques, your brushwork for certain details and compositions will become simpler and less worked-over. Recommended for that reason."
4,Great nutrition book for medical students!,"Written by a doctor for doctors. Gives you all the info about nutrtion, vitamins and minerals, where they're found and how to treat if needed. It's an invaluable reference for any doctor who wants to treat patients using nutrition."
3,It's your Grandmother..........!,"""The Dark Sides"" is nothing to scream about, but if you don't have songs like ""Shrine"" and ""The Lake"", then this album is for you! Mainly a list of King's B-sides songs. ""Shrine"" is possibly one the bands' finest."
3,"Entertainment only, no literary value","This book can be an entertaining read if you have low literary expectations. The characters are very poorly drawn-- each individual is either perfectly noble and wonderful or evil and vindictive. The plot turns are similarly too melodramatic, though the story moves fast and keeps your attention. This type of story does have value in that it helps readers understand the day-to-day intellectual struggles people endured when considering the political issues that ultimately led to the Civil War."
4,Reading vs DVD,I was given the DVD Collection as a gift and wanted to see how far off the story went. I was amazed at how much was different. Love the book --- the DVD is lacking.
4,North and South,Thought it would be large print.It wasn'tDon't know who was wrong but everything else was just fine.
1,I hated this book...just not real,"It appears that John Jakes likes to write about conflict. This book is comprised of conflict in war, conflict in relationships etc. etc. To me his characters do not seem real. Also, I don't like the way he creates situations where he reverses right and wrong. It is a book that lifts immorality as a good thing. This was my first and last John Jakes book."
5,Definitely in the Top 10!,"John Jakes is one of my favorite authors and the ""North and South"" books rank in my favorite top 10, too. I know these books are very long, but once you start reading, you don't even think about it. The characters are described so well, you feel like you are a part of their lives and you are actually living in another century. My favorite characters are Orry and Madeline, George and Constance, and Brett and Billy. John Jakes keeps you on the edge of seat during the part when Orry and George are fighting in the Mexican war. You grow to despise characters like Bent, Justin LaMotte, and Virgilia Hazard. I'd just like to punch that Justin LaMotte right in the nose! He is the biggest jerk! So start reading this book - then you have to read the sequels - they are equally as good!"
4,Withstands the test of time,"Although this series has been available for quite some time, I have finally undertaken the reading of this epic story. When I saw that the first book had 883 pages I almost swooned. So much for a quick read! thought I. But I chipped away page by page and was soon finished. I must credit John Jakes with creating an historically accurate story so interesting, and characters so complex, that I simply had to keep reading. I was compelled to do so.The Hazards and the Mains have been part of my life since I saw the screen adaptation many years ago. Even reading this first book, I kept hearing Patrick Swayze's voice as Orry Main. If you love history, have a passing interest in the Civil War or the institution of slavery, this is a must-read!flag"
5,This epic novel enthrills the reader with suspenseful drama.,North and South is one of the most interesting and informative Civil War fiction novels that I have ever read. His in depth writing style coveys the real images of the War Between the States. He is truly a skilled and well educated author. I would recommend his books to anyone!
5,Chris's Game Reviews 4: NFL Fever 2003,"Welcome to Episode 4 of Chris's Game Reviews. NFL Fever 2002 blew us away, so 2003 will...us all. It has new features, too.It has all-new fantasy teams, old dynasties, and new game features, too. There is now lightning in the rainy games. There are also a few new stadiums, too. But the best thing is the dynasty! It now has a selectable quarter length. In a few issues of Xbox Magazine people were asking that question alot. Well, it has finally been answered and we can all go home now! My next review will be about DOA Xtreme Beach Volleyball! Bikinis or no?"
3,Nothing Has Changed,"I am happy I rented the game before I bought it. The changes made to the game are minor. This was supposed to rival Madden, but not this year. It seems like they focused too much on online play, that they forgot about everything else. The play editor is actually worse than last year. There are a few more options for create-a-team, but not enough. Look at NCAA Football 2003 to see how it should be. Why does my created player have to be limited to 82 Overall. This should be my decision how good my player is. In conclusion, I am upset with Fever because it didn't build after last year's best football game. I am even more upset that I have to consider going back to Madden."
3,Nothing more than a roster update really....,"Ah, I am the first review... I picked up NFL Fever 2003 and was somewhat dissapointed. Although I do consider it a good game, it doesn't improve on the problems of 2002 at all. You can still make the long pass almost every play. I can't say much about it, just read a Fever 2002 review and you've got this game. Although the announcing is MUCH better than last years version."
1,Horrible DO NOT BUY,"mmm so i bought this game wanting a good internet football game, but this [is weak], Xbox Live play is awful because salary cap isn't a requirement so people make [imitation] teams, and game [is weak], overall the game isn't realistic, passing is [unrealistic], tackling is the only good part but like running and movement in general is TOOO FAST... anyway, DON""T BUY THIS GAME"
4,Excellent game play,"Finally a game that has the nice graphics WITH the realistic game speed. PLaying at the rookie level makes it easy, but if you just turn it up to Veteran level, then the computer opponents are significantly tougher. This game will also be great for online playing when Xbox Live goes live in November. Now I can't wait to see how Madden 2003 and Sega NFL 2K3 has responded to the challenge from NFL Fever 2003. Football on Xbox has never been this good, and I hope Madden and 2K3 also has taken advantage of Xbox's capabilities."
2,alright i guess,"this game just seemed boring, the announcers made me wanna sleep. i got fever 2002 and thought it was cool, but now i dont know which seris of football games ill get now. save ur money this game is homo"
1,Stick to Nfl Fever 2002,"The only thing good about this game is the Texans and the Seahawks new uniforms. Donavan McNabb couldn't complete a pass against the COWBOYS! So embarrasing. There are better things like night games in seasons or the hand warmer, but I'd rather waste my 50 bucks on a Seahawks game. It is pretty much impossible!!!!! DO NOT BUY NFL FEVER 2003!!! STICK WITH NFL FEVER 2002!!!!!!!!!"
4,Liked it with one major flaw...,"I really enjoyed this game. This is my first ever console sports purchase.The graphics are superb. The grass looks so real you can smell it. The fabric on uniforms have texture and I'll swear that the eyes move. Game play was simple enough; I don't know too much about football, but even I could understand it well enough.The only problem I had was the inability to cut back on interceptions. I think that they should have a downloadable patch for this game so that the interceptions are cut WAY back. Playing against my wife, we had one game in which there were around 20 interceptions (which gets maddening at times). Before you start thinking that we're just bad players, the same thing happens against the computer.On the other hand, it is a beautifully rendered game with lots of extras and a nice design scheme. Definitely worth the purchase."
2,Not worth it,"One night a had a friend over, we both have an xbox and he had fever 03 so i asked him to bring it over. he brought it over and we started playing, i noticed how he was using cheap plays to get in the endzone(like using a hail mary every time). and he finnaly whooped me by about 50 points. with my confidence level down to about zero, i decided to rent it to see if i could atleast beat the cpu and see the special features. So when i finally rented the game i put it in, played it and whooped the computer by about the final score of 70-3. After a while of beating the computer terribly bad i decided it wasnt very amusing any more although the fast game pace and good graphics is impressing, it just seems microsoft cant decide if it wants to make a blitz type game or a madden type game. i am a football and a football video game fanatic, but this one just didnt seem to get me excited. I would recomend either madden 03, blitz 03, or even tecmo bowl over this game. its not worth it."
3,NFL Fever 2003,"As a big fan of last years NFL fever 2002, I highly anticipated the arrival of the next title NFL fever 2003. When I put that game in my Xbox I was excited but when I begun to scroll threw the teams in Single Game mode I realized that the game is slow when trying to select a team. The commentary [is not good] but so did last years, the graphics are pushed up and it shows and so does the long skinny players who are stretched out. I do suggest getting NFL 2k3, because NFL Fever runs at 60fps but still seams slow."
2,Bad Game! What's With All These Good Reviews?,"This game is Microsoft's poor excuse for competing with EA and Sega/ESPN sports. I've owned or rented all of the football games, and this one is by far the worst! There isn't one aspect of this game that even competes with the others. Graphics, gameplay, etc., are all inferior and unrealistic. I played a game with the Rams, using their throwback uniforms, and they don't even look close to the actual uniforms. It's like the people who made this game have no background in sports at all, and are just going by memory, by the way an old Genesis game might have been about ten years ago. I've been a loyal Madden fan for years, but I'd have to say that the Sega NFL 2K3 game holds the top spot right now, all around. I don't know why NFL Fever 2003 has so many good reviews here. I'm trying to figure out why I gave it even two stars."
4,Good football game,"What can I say it is a nice sequel to the 2002 version. I've played the heck out of the 2002 one, even more than Halo or any other games. I love the Dynasty mode and the offseason almost as much as I do playing the games. I've spent hours getting the best players that I can while staying under the salary cap and I really enjoy watching the players career stats build up over the seasons to form NFL records for single game, season, team, and career. Who will become a hall of famer and who won't? Good graphics, sound, and playability. I like the ability to design your own plays, change who starts, and all kinds of other stuff.If you have the 2002 version then that may be all you need, but for the price its at now, buy it and play it."
5,-NFL FEVER 2003 HITS HARD!-,"First thought:""better than madden!"" NFL Fever 2003 delivers the hard hits and great plays, plus hard-core realism and online competion that lets yougo head to head or build a team to take on the world! Whether you like like the power and control of an NFL general manager or the shudder of knocking an opponent into next week, from draft day to the superbowl, this is your game. Take yourself deep in the NFL with all aspects of team managment at your command, cutting-edge gameplay offers seamless control of the NFL world!Test your limits as new tougher AI shuts down your passing game. Take on the greatest teams in football history with the classic challenge and dynasty superbowl challenge, play online for world domination as you battle it out for the top spot. Don't miss the smooth slick graphics, and in your-face player reaction and captured moves and expretions! NFL Fever 2003 is better than madden, and is a must have for any football fan!"
1,garbage,"THIS IS BY FAR THE WORSE FOOTBALL GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. THE GAME CONTROLS GIVE YOU NO FEEL FOR THE GAME LIKE MADDEN DOES AND EVERYTIME YOU THROW THE BALL IT SEEMS AS THOUGH YOU GET INTERCEPTED. PLAYING THIS GARBAGE IS JUST LIKE WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME ON TV. FEVER 2002 IS A MUCH MORE REALISTIC GAME THAN FEVER 2003, AS A MATTER OF FACT I GAVE MY FEVER 2003 TO A FRIEND FOR 2002 FEVER. MICROSOFT SHOULD'VE DONE EVERYTHING THAT MADDEN DID AND ADDED BETTER COMMENTARY AND THEY WOULD'VE HAD A WINNER. IM OUT MADDEN FOR LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,dont judge a game by its graphics,"This game has awesome graphics, but not much else. It has a gameplay similar to NFL Blitz, but u cant commit all those penalties. It's almost impossible to stop the high powered offense on the easiest setting, and the defense is incredible. Unless ur an incredible football sim player dont buy this game."
2,The dark shadow of Microsoft,"While at first I was excited to play the new creation from Microsoft as I really enjoyed its prdecessor. I enjoyed the robust game engine and the updated graphics. My joy soon turned to disbelief as I played on fanatically for a week to take my team (Houston Texans) to the Superbowl with me as a star linebacker (create-a-player). Imagine my horror and disbelief when my team with a perfect record failed to show up in the play-off grid. I contacted Microsoft and received a ""oh yeah we knew about that and we are working on it"". I know that at times Houston sports teams can be the [...] child of professional sports organizations but come-on beta testers, test everything will ya. I guess I will have to wait for them to fix the game, recall the disk, and ship me a knew disk whenever they decide to get around to it."
4,a rip off!,this game is bad. mircosoft did awful on this game. this game only gets one star because every thing is wrong in the game. all the players do in the game is cheat and lose. the players even miss the ball a lot. heres how they cheat if the team you are playing agasint if they throw the ball and its imcompelete the coaches will say that counts then it will be a first down and thats cheating. if mircosoft is going to make nfl fever 2004 they should not make the players cheat so much. if you want a good football game get nfl blitz 20-03. any way they are going to have nfl blitz 20-04 get blitz instaed of nfl fever.
5,love this scent,got it before promised. Just wished it came in a larger size. I am always afraid that one day I am not going to be able to get this scent. I love it and hated it when they discontinued it at the store...
4,Simply by Clinique,Simply by Clinique is a fresh smelling subtle perfume. I always get compliments whenever I wear it.
5,Best Scent Ever!,"This is my all time favorite scent, but has become very hard to find in department stores. Light and simple, not sure why it was never more popular...but then again that may be one reason I love it so!"
2,great idea but crooked,"Loved the idea of this rack... whenever I entertain I end up with half-sheet pans all over the place. So I finally ordered it...and although supposedly out of stock, I was thrilled to get it right away. I am soooo disappointed! The top two racks are not level...they angle dramatically upward and anything on the tray will easily slide to the side. So sadly, I packed it back up and I'm about to request a return authorization. I always carefully check reviews before ordering, but missed the one (out of close to 70 mostly glowing accounts) with a similar complaint. Because I still love the concept and the item did get an average 4.5 star rating...I'll request an exchange...though its a tad unnerving that the aforementioned customer is on their THIRD rack which ""seems fine"". Hope my replacement works...."
5,great,i bought this during xmas seaxon because i needed it and now i use it for everyday cooking...i love it
4,baking rack,"Saves space but can cause sliding. There is a slight angle to the ""shelves"" which can cause some of the more slippery cookies to slide right off the back - but as long as they are not too close to the edge, even this isn't really a problem. I like being able to cool an entire large batch of cookies without loosing all my counter space - and the fact that the rack folds up flat is great for storage!"
4,Happy With Purchase,I got this rack for my husband who loves to bake ALOT. So far no issues with it. It works as described and seems to be fairly study. We can't wait to use this for the coming Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday as it will definitely keep our counter space free for multiple baking projects.
5,Why didn't someone think of this sooner?,"I love this thing! No matter how much counter space you have, you can't ever find enough room for trays of Christmas cookies. This gadget solves that problem.I also like to use it when I make homemade pasta. I can lay the pasta sheets out on cookie trays and stack them up near the pasta machine. No more trailing around the kitchen with pasta sheets flapping in the breeze, looking for a place to lay them out to dry."
2,Pastor as Person,I have not received this book that was has been paid for the book was purchased for a seminary class I do not feel that it is right to pay for something and not receive it from from owner
1,Not very funny....,"If you are a fan of the n-word then this might be for you. I primarily purchased this item because of Tony Roberts and EarthQuake's interaction on the show ""Comics Unleashed"" and when I discovered that they were on a comedy show together I decided to order it but when I received it and heard practically every comic, shy of Tony Roberts I believe, use the n-word somewhere in their performance, I became disgusted. I do not use this word and I don't appreciate paying to hear anyone, whether we share the same race or not, use that word. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
4,Classic work,"I discovered this book at the age of 15 in a box of one of my father's college books. I ended up reading it, and it sparked an interest in the history of science and technology, as well as the philosophy of science. I ended up reading perhaps a dozen other books in these two areas before I even got to college, becoming fairly knowledgeable about the subjects while still a fairly young teenager, and I continued these studies in college, even though I ultimately majored in something else--neurobiology. I have Butterfield's classic work to thank for this, and although I understand there are better histories on the subject now, it nevertheless fulfilled an important role in my early intellectual development."
5,"it is cheap, it works, it ROCKS!!","Buy one. For the price you just can't find anything better.2 gigs is big enough for most things you will do with it, but not enough to back up our favorite files (dammit!).That being said, we use this more than we do email. This makes transferring files to and from any computer fast and easy, and we have had files worth over a million dollars on ours - and never lost a byte. Our came with a cool neck band, making it extremely easy to keep track of.don't waste $80 on a 3 or 4 gig. Buy two of these. You will love yours."
4,No problems,I use this item to save personal data at work so that it won't be on the company's hard drive. Easy to use & has a lanyard with it so that it can be worn around the neck if necessary. I love this item.
2,"Its ok, but not recommended","I have the 512MB drive and I have used about 30% of the space. The drive now tells me that it cannot create a path. Or it says check to make sure the drive is not full. I have to take everything off and put it into a seperate folder, add what I want to the drive and then transfer everything back on. That is the only way it works. This is the second one that I have had and I am having the same problems. Not happy with it."
4,Cross-platform programming,"This item is usually fantastic. Loads quickly and easily. No corruption of data. However, I have had to reformat the disk to FAT-32 3 times in the past two months because of issues with certain versions of Windows XP automatically reformatting it to a non-Mac-compatible format.I use the product to transfer files among several computers in three different work environments, and the auto-reformatting is annoying. Some XP machines do this and some do not - I have not figured out how to stop it from happening. No online documentation or support from the manufacturer or distributor to help figure it out."
2,"Works as advertised, bad cap design.","This drive was a good price, and it works as advertised, but the problem I have with it is that the cap does not snap on; it just slides on. I keep the traveldrive on my keychain in my pocket most of the time, and I lost the cap about a week after I got it. I still use it and carry it around without the cap because I paid for it, but if I had to do it again, I would get one with a snapping cap, even if it cost a little more."
3,To brief on too many subjects,"I borrowed this from my local library, and I'm glad that I didn't buy it. I read though it and was not all that excited by it. I really expected more detail in the history section. Then again, the book was made to be a companion to a TV series which couldn't have possibly addressed everything so this is somewhat understandable. But as a stand-alone book this book is not that great."
5,The Blues Brothers,This is a great soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
4,Classic songs,"You can't go wrong with the Peter Gunn theme, Minnie the Moocher, and Rawhide. Those 3 take you right back into the movie and justify the cost of the CD right there, then the other classics are icing on the cake. Required CD for anyone who loved that cult classic movie."
2,What a disappointment!,"""The Blues Brothers"" film has two of the transcendant moments of rock & soul music - Aretha Franklin's revisiting ""Think"" and Ray Charles' high octane take on ""Shake a Tail Feather."" So why, on this soundtrack CD, did the producers choose other versions? And what's with all the fadeouts? It's not like there wasn't room on the cd. The Ray Charles recording has much less energy than the one on the film, and the Franklin cut doesn't seem as tight. Plus ""Jailhouse Rock"" omits most of the solos. This could be a great soundtrack, but it deserves a much better treatment than it receives here."
