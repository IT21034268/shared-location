3,Issued incorrect honey,"I love airborne honey as it reminds me of home. However, I am sorry we received manuka a strong flavor of honey rather than the creamed honey that I requested. Please pay more attention to the orders as our kids do not like the strong flavor manuka honey offers. We are glad to see more products offered from nz on amazon."
3,heros of the west vol. 1,"1.the adventures of jim bowie ""rezin bowie,gambler"" #29 3/22/57 2.annie oakley ""joker on horseback"" #48 6/10/56 3.the roy rogers show ""hidden treasures"" #62 12/19/54 4.the cisco kid ""quarter horse"" #47 1/29/52 This is a cascadia DVD. The roy rogers show is poor in quality looks like a second generation tape transfer.The cisco kid has lost some red color (slight bleeding),but not too bad. The big problem with this DVD is that in each episode there seems to be a glitch in the transfering (worse in the roy rogers episode) as it seems to freeze frame in spots for just a few seconds on it's own, an then continues in the play mode. none of this is all that bad and will not ruin your day."
5,Love this product!,I love this product. Both kids and grownups think it's comfortable and it takes up very little room when deflated.
4,CHAMBERLAIN PD210D GARAGE DOOR OPENER,Directions were concise there were no missing parts it was easy to assembly and it works as advertised! GOOD JOB CHAMBERLAIN!
4,Cool entry level operator,"This is a basic garage operator. It works just as advertised and the general structure is pretty solid. Assembly and installation is harder than described but it's overall easy, even the wiring. You should get another person to help mount the unit.The price is very fair."
4,It was fine,"It was fine works as expected, if I now could only get it to work with the transmitter built into the car I have."
4,Quick Delivery,"Amazon may have had a problem delivering in the past, but I received mine in 2 days with the super saver shipping. Don't let the reviews scare you away from this solid product."
1,Don't buy it,"First of all it is not easy to install, way too many pieces, wires, adjustments and things. Second, it is not reliable, it works sometimes others don't, after checking the diagnostic LED, running the recommended test from the instructions manual, the conclusion was ""RPM sensor damaged"", solution ""replace it"". What? I just bought it, how is that possible? What this even tested at the factory? ... Anyway my recommendation ""Don't buy it""."
4,Chamberlain Garage Door Opener,This is a very good product for the price. I am very satisfied with it for quality and ease of installation.
3,Exceptional book - Bad translation.,"I love the book <<Pierre et Jean>>. I first read it in my Advanced Placement French Language/Literature class. After reading this particular English translation - the Penguin version - I was dismayed at the lack of English grammar the translator exhibited. The book has major grammar mistakes in almost every chapter. Some of these mistakes are not too picky either. For example, the subjunctive mood is often tossed aside by the author. I recommend the book to everyone, but please purchase a different translation - he didn't do the best job with this one. Enjoy!"
1,Horribly poorly edited edition,"The text presented here is a disgrace, replete with typographical errors, and missing entire paragraphs on p.80. I would have returned it except that I had already written notes on it. Do not buy this edition."
4,Très triste,"Un roman très triste, c'est l'histoire d'une famille dans le port de Le Havre. Il y a deux frères (Pierre et Jean, docteur et avocat) dans la famille. L'occasion d'un héritage énorme deviens la raison pour beaucoup de soupons, doutes, et colère entre eux. a finit par détruire la famille. Maupassant explore les motivations profonds des gens, et il trouve que, au fond, les gens ne sont pas genereux sinon méfiantes, jaloux, et avides. Mme l'amour ne peut pas surmonter ses problèmes."
3,Nothing special.,Save your money and shop at Home Depot or Lowes. I'm pretty sure you can get something similar to this at one of those two places.
1,Buy a heavy duty tarp!,"If you want a nice pad for a pool buy a heavy duty tarp. It might cost twice as much, but will be larger and far thicker and stronger. For less than twice the price, of this one, I got a 16x20 tarp which was very heavy, and treated for sun exposure. Please do not waste your money on this one. It is more suitable to make a kite out of, it is paper thin. Intex should drop this product, because it is a very poor product, and will not protect against much."
1,Cheap cheap cheap 1 ply tarp,"I should have read the reviews but I was in a hurry, and just bought it. It came yesterday and it is so cheap. You can buy the cheapest tarp at walmart and it will be about the same. It's too big for the 12 foot pool too. Wish I had just run across the street instead of waiting on shipping."
2,product description not accurate,"I purchased an easy set pool, 16' x 42"" and decided i wanted a ground cloth for placement under the pool since i had a smaller pool previously and although the pool was not damaged while sitting on the ground it did make for additional cleaning at the end of the season. So, when i puchased this ground cloth the descriiption indicated that it was for all pools up to 16'; however when it arrived the product package indicated that it was for pools up to 15 1/2'. i could have purchased this same product at Big Lots at a cheaper price, but did not because it would not provide coverage for my size pool. So now I am left with 1/2 foot of pool without coverage. I did respond to Amazon about this issue and almost immediately after receiving the product (approximately one month ago) and have yet to receive a reply."
2,Just buy a tarp!,This is nothing more than a cheap tarp you can buy at your local discount store. Don't waste your time and money.
3,it's a tarp,It's a ground cloth or tarp. What ever you want to call it.It lasted one season in the sun. Served its purpose.
2,Ground Cloth,"Very thin. Folded it twice to fit under the pool I have. After just a couple of months, the cloth was ripping apart. We were getting blue on our feet. Would not recommend."
2,Intex Pool Ground Cloth - why does Amazon have this listed as a Toy???,"We just purchased our third intex pool in eight years and previous years we have used a heavy-duty tarp. This year I spent more money and bought this Intex ground cloth which claims to be ""extra padded""... well, that's a joke! Thankfully, I only paid $18 for this disappointing ground cover. This is THE thinnest ""tarp"" I've ever seen. Next year, I will go back to the discount warehouse where I can buy a 16' heavy duty tarp for $8-$12. I would NOT waste my money on this Intext ground cloth."
3,It protects your hard work,"It's true that the ground cloth really doesn't protect the pool but what it does protect is all the hard work spent getting the ground level. If you had to use sand to level the ground the cloth will protect the sand from hard rain and water from the pool. The last thing you want after several hours of laser-leveling and tamping sand is for it to erode and wash away. So, yes, while it's a bit too flimsy to protect the pool it at least protects the sand underneath the pool, especially when you've brought the pool inside, from eroding and washing away.As for the product itself it's pretty flimsy. We've had the ground cover that came with our 16' pool for a couple of years now and it's completely deteriorated. Expect to replace it every two years if you live in the northeast and keep it out all year."
2,Cheap square tarp for a round pool,Way too big for a 10 foot round pool. Cheaply made. Difficult to tuck in the flapping corners after water is in the pool. Would not purchase next time.
2,Ok for the price,"It is just a basic tarp that you can buy at any home improvement store. Not sure how the price compares though. It needs to be tacked down and tears VERY easily, but does the job of keeping as much debris off my kids feet while they are in and out of the pool."
4,Works Great... But,Works Great... And is very durable.. But the only thing i dislike about it is it should of came with ancor pins.. Or Ground stakes... Because if you have the 12ftx3fx3ft 3 in intex metal frame pool it leaves the 4 corners and sides vulnerable to the wind .... you have to weight them down all the way around to keep it from rolling in on its self....
5,Awesome,"One of the greatest bands to rise out of the early to mid ninties emo scene. The production of the album could've been better, and one could only imagine what this album would've sounded like with better quality.Definitely ahead of their time."
3,Track Listing,Track Listing1. Crying In The Rain (Radio Edit) 3:542. Crying In The Rain (Extended Version) 5:383. Crying In The Rain (Doug Laurent Mix) 6:094. Crying In The Rain (Brainformed Mix) 6:545. Crying In The Rain (Let The Love House Mix) 3:526. Crying In The Rain (Sweetbox Funky Mix) 3:227. Crying In The Rain (Not Normal Mix) 3:308.

2,"Great player, poor jersey","I have always wanted a football jersey, and this was my first. I am very disappointed in the quality of this jersey, it is very cheaply made and at the price of $100 it is far from worth it. I have since ordered another jersey at half the price of this one and I must say it is much nicer and will last me many years, where I feel with this one I might only get to wear it for maybe a season or two before it falls apart."
4,Royal Navy and the steam engine,"As an inventor, I read Wallace's book with interest. He describes 3 episodes of innovation in earlier centuries. The first is probably the most crucial. Around the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. When the Royal Navy unintentionally provided important support for the development and continual refinement of the steam engine, over a period of 100 years. A contribution not commonly known. Most accounts of the stream engine rightfully credit Trevithick, Watt, Stevenson and Newcomen. But in that era, the supplementary assistance furnished by the Royal Navy is posited by Wallace to have also been vital. Wallace describes the extensive support in terms of material and manpower that the Navy provided.The two other essays in the book might also be of interest to readers."
2,could be better,I've only had this a few months. It makes a nice cup of coffee but the pink enamel stains easily and is already chipping off around the spout. It also has a design fault as the lower tip of the handle tends to melt from the heat of the gas stove as the coffee perks.
5,great basics video,I enjoyed the video greatly. Cory shows you how to lift weights the right way to keep your form when doing lifts. She explains everything in a straight forward easy way. This video would be great for anyone starting and not knowing the first thing about proper weight training. I would recommed this to any woman no matter what age. I'm 47 weight training made me stronger and it didnt hurt my golf game either.
5,Van Gogh's Table at the Auberge Ravooux,"Thank's, I went Auberge Ravooux in this september and take a runch same as table.This is my important memorry."
5,Great chocolate recipes,An interesting combination of information about Van Gogh's last months in a small town together with recipes from a restaurant in the auberge (inn) where he was living.The recipes are from a functioning restaurant and the chocolate recipes are the best you will ever taste - and easy to make.
2,Galapagos World's End,"I found it terribly dry and difficult to wade through, despite the fact that I was on my way to the Galapagos. Even after I got back home, I simply couldn't get through it. I is scientific to a fault, in my opinion and although it reads like a novel, I thought it got bogged down in the minutia of specimen collections."
2,Be careful with the description above...,"""More than 100 splendid illustrations""Nope. No splendid illustrations. Forget about it.There's, according to the book:- 39 drawings- 75 photosBut, according to me, there's:- 16 clipped colored drawings on the book cover and flaps.- 114 flat, whithout contrast, poorly printed black-and-white photos.So, it's basically a text book with some photo's inside. I didn't read it already, but I'm posting this so you don't buy this like me, expecting for ""splendid illustrations"" and ended up with an text book. Poorly impressed. On poor paper.But wait, there's the color cover...I shall update this when finishing reading. I hope the text worth it."
5,For the avid golfer and great reference guide,"I have had the opportunity to play some great courses. Before I go to a well known course, I go to this book and review the holes I am going to play. The pictures are fantastic and the history is great. Lastly, before I took a trip to France, I took out this book and reviewed the potential courses. It was a great starting point to put the itinerary together and we played some beautiful courses. This is a great gift for any avid golfer."
5,A Wonderful Book,This book is very informative. The courses mentioned are the world's best. The author writes with real affection. Each chapter is well researched. I highly reccommend this book.
4,Great coffee table book or gift,If you are looking for a gorgeous book for your coffee table or a perfect gift for the golfer in your life than you should consider this book. I bought a copy of this and then created a new list of all the places I wanted to go play golf. The photos are amazing.
5,OUTOF THE FIRE AND IN TO THE VOLCANO,"OK,WELL IN THIS ONE, After the trio of marionettes start to fall to pieces while on the job, Otaru decides it high time they all went to pay a visit to the marionette doctor! Meanwhile, Tiger and her team, hoping not to be recognized, are at large in the city. WITH THE TRIO SICK AND TIGER AND THE GANG PAINTING THE TOWN ""BLOOD RED"" WILL ARE HERO GET BETTER IN TIME TO STOP HIM!?!"
5,Go ED. A man ahead but in tune with his time.,"Most people see Ed as an icon, which he was/is, few knew the man. I was very fortunate to have met him when in HS, and almost 40 yrs later 800mi away in another state. He was a talented man, a gifted artist, a somewhat insecure businesman, but a man with a soul. Find what you want to find, Ed Roth was a complex individual; should be more of them."
4,"Interesting book, but the writing is not great.","I was really looking forward to reading this book; and while it was interesting, I think the book falls short in two ways. First, the writing is somewhat sophmoric. The author writes as one would talk, and there was not a clear chronology. He jumped around and sometimes repeated information. Secondly, I was really looking forward to seeing photographs of Roth's vehicles, but there were limited photographs of some of the vehicles. I understand that maybe not many photographs were available from Roth's family's archives, but certainly, there were other sources for the photographs of the cars that appeared at major shows. I would recommend this book to Roth fans, but there may be other better books out there."
5,Beautiful Book!,"This is a great book, a must have for Big Daddy fans and hot rodders alike. A great compainion to ""Rat Fink: The Art of Ed ""Big Daddy"" Roth. I love the hard cover because I hope to have this book to show my kids someday. Ed Roth lives forever through his fans."
5,Indispensable,"For anyone thinking about writing about food, wether to make money or just for food, this is a must-read book."
5,Straightforward and practical advice for the food writer.,"Reading this book is a like having coffee with a writing coach. Dianne's straightforward advice and style is practical, encouraging the aspiring writer without cheer-leading. She draws from years of writing and publishing experience graciously offered by some of the greats of our time, as well as accomplished bloggers breaking new ground. In-line with her goal to ""help you write about food"" each chapter concludes with writing exercises--just the sort of thing that forces you to use what you learn. Will Write for Food provides direction for continued reading, as well as guidance for focused writing; something every writer needs--to read and write more."
5,A great reference for any one wanting to know about food writing,I loved the first book and couldn't wait for the Revised Edition. Ms. Jacob did not fail me. Jacob writes using great real world examples and information from real food writers in all aspects of food writing. She tells it like it is. And every topic is covered from reviewing to blogging to recipe writing and cookbook development. If you would like more information about writing about food in any aspect of the industry this is a wonderful book to read and reread.
5,Tight Focus on Food Writing,"I have read many advice/guidance books on writing, and I truly found this book to have more practical and thorough information than all others I have read - and solely on the subject of food writing! The 'Interview Subjects,' 'Bibliography,' and 'Selected Web Sites' sections knocked my socks off. It is obvious that Dianne Jacob put a lot of time and effort into this book. I read it completely in just three days, and I will refer to it regularly for my food writing pursuits."
3,condensed version of a better book,"This Singer series book is quite nice. However, it turns out to be a shorter version of another book, Exploring Textile Arts, published two years later by the same publisher. Nowhere does either book indicate this relationship, but the text and illustrations for the various techniques described are identical. Buy one or the other, but not both!"
3,"A nice book, but road accuracy questionable","I used the Nevada Atlas & Gazetteer on a trip this summer, and mostly it was useful. However, we ran into a number of places where a road indicated as an ""other state route or major connector"" either required 4WD to pass, or was blocked by a locked gate. In my book, state routes and major connectors can be used by the general public, and probably in a passenger car - even in Nevada.However, the topographical representations are nice, and it was a good reference to have. I just quit trusting it after a day or so."
2,Surely a winner with feminists,"A novel which is critcal of the objectification of females and their subjugation at the hands of men but a novel which offers no alternative depiction. The women in the novel have little identity other than as objects and, for the most part, accept this role with token resistance. The most fleshed out (and yet singularly vapid character) in the novel lies helpless in hospital and is, even at death's door, subject to the will of the man/men in her life.Half-baked really.Re other reviews: yes, at the end of the day, the novel is really not worth the effort."
3,3 to 4 stars,"My ferrets love it. The elbows, tunnels and tee fit together with each other well, however I can't rate more than 3 to 4 stars as the connection where the parts fit into the ball is not well made. It's loose, and the parts do not stay attached to the ball. This part is not well designed.Super Pet FerreTrail Fun-nel Playground Tube Kit, Colors Vary"
5,wow!,"this i have to say is one of the best books i have ever read. i read all four books, and i loved them. i was so upset when i finally finished it. i just wanted to keep readng it. it is a wonderful book!"
3,"DWJ... when she is good, she is very very good","But this, I'm afraid, is not among her best. Tying off the Dalemark series years later, long after the original readers (this one included) had grown up, this book is a little weaker than the others. One reads it more out of loyalty to Jones than out of a desire to keep turning the pages. Things are not really tied together. You have to read it, of course, because it's a Diana Wynne Jones book, but don't get your hopes up too high. Buy the paperback."
3,"OK, but not that great...","I rate this as a 3, not because of the quality of any of the tracks, but because... I got this first on cassette several years ago. I noticed that in writing, Rhino promises the listener the long version of ""Lay Down (Candles In The Rain),"" but my copy had the short version of it! I thought maybe it was because it was on cassette; after all, there are extra tracks that you can only get on the CD version. So I got it on CD also. Again, all I heard was the short version of the song, though Rhino promises the long version! That really disappointed me, and still does. Heck...at least they included ""Bitter Bad""...but nobody should promise something and then not deliver it.Other than that, I'm not dissatisfied with this collection at all. I've finally come forward with my main complaint. I'd like to know if the record companies read the reviews. If they do, this one's geared toward waking Rhino up to their slight error.Enjoy the CD anyway."
5,awesome book,"I read this book and handed it out like candy to my friends. He explains that it's not a guarantee to keep your children, but adds that we need to balance the love of Christ and the Fear of God so that they know they will still be accountable to someone even when no body is looking-because God is. He stresses and gives practical examples on the 10 commandments to teach our children about them and how to remember them. Another book to read to children is The Way of the Master for Children. Good beginning for preschool and the rest of the book to give children a firm foundation why they believe in God. Both awesome books!"
2,It works - But only for a while,"I've now purchased two of these openers and each went out after only a couple of years. When it was new, it worked well but be prepared, it will fail when you need it most. My most recent failure was when my wife went out walking and a storm came up. She was unable to get back in the house becasue ""The Clicker"" was dead.I'm replacing mine today....but with another brand."
4,Works fine - somewhat cheaply built.,"This product works fine and I programmed my opener to recognize it with no problems whatsoever. The first reviewer writes that it works great and then any button will work the door. He likely failed to read this in the instructions:""Once programmed, the keypad remains active for 15 seconds. During this time you may stop, reverse or reactivate the door by pressing any number on the keypad.""In other words, once you have put in your code, any key you touch in the next 15 seconds will work the door. I've tried it on mine. It works just as the instructions say."
1,won't last two years,"mine worked about 16 months, then ""the lights went out"" it seems they made this thing to last that long according to all the other complaints. the problem with something like this is that when you discover it does not work, you are outside with no keys."
1,It will bite you on a rainy night,"This opener worked ok for a year then failed while we were away on vacation and my mother was watching the house and dog.She took him for a walk and came back to find that the door wouldn't open. I'll never hear the end of it now!! Buy some thing better or hard-wired and battery-less 25 min. on the help line and I got tired of ""pushing 1 for other choises""Junk and no suppport"
2,Worked fine...and then just died,"After 18 months of sporadic use, the device stopped responding. Thinking it was likely time for a new battery I replaced that, but still no functionality returned; no lights on the keypad as there had always been before.Good instructions and simple installation. However, from my way of seeing it these things should last longer."
1,SENT WRONG MODEL,"I ORDERED chamberlain two door opener model clk1, AND WAS SENT A LIFTMASTER MODEL 387LM(THIS IS A 1 DOOR OPENER)"
2,You get what you pay for,"The old addage is true with this product. I went on the cheap and this is what I got. Who knows if the wireless transmission is the problem or if it's the ancient garage door opener, but either way the success rate of this product is about 50%. Programming it is no problem and hanging it on the wall is pretty simple for anyone who knows which end of the screwdriver to grab. If you're looking for reliability, you may want to spend the extra $10 to upgrade to the next model"
2,"Good Product, Bad Customer Service","Had product 2 1/2 years with no problems. Then when had problem, discovered that there is NO toll free #, a hold time of 40 min which I guess is why they want it on your dime, they sell NO spare parts, The staff is lackadaisical, they downgraded from a 2-door to a 1-door opener, staff has no idea why, adding insult to injury, they sent me an email that said my problem was ""solved"" then sent me a survey with a 500 character limit for comments. I wasted 4 hours total trying to address problem before abandoning project."
5,Garage Door Keyless,"New item purchased is for a relative. it is the same item that I currently use at home. Only problem is the cover fades over time, but it can be painted."
1,Two Failures in 3 months,"My replacement unit just failed after 3 weeks of operation. Same failure as original. A dead keypad with a good battery. Looking for another brand. Support phone line had the most unfriendly tree for help I have ever seen. Endless prompts with the fear you might hit the wrong one and have to start all over again! Easy to program and operate but seems to lack quality in the hardware design. I might add the first one I bought didn't work out of the box and the local store swapped me a ""good"" one (which failed in two months)."
2,Difficult to program--fails after 2-3 years,"Unit worked fine for 2 1/2 years but then failed. It's a little bit difficult to program, but if you read the directions closely and follow verbatim, you shouldn't have a problem.Keep the instructions in a safe place as you will need them to change the code/reprogram when changing battery as the unit loses all information and has to be reprogrammed when you change the battery."
1,Not at all good for me,I have an Intellicode Genie and this does not work with that brand. It is advertised as universal but when I tried it it specifically says no Intellicode. They do not explain this in the Item description.
1,Incompatible,"If you have a ""Genie"" anything, I would recommend that you don't purchase. The information on the package said it was incompatable with one Genie garage door opener, however after struggling to program, etc. I finally had to call the manufacturer who informed me that it was not compatible with my model either...so...it is going back."
3,"Weak instructions, OK device","I read the one other existing review for this device, and must agree, the manual is poorly written. The device does work as advertised, once you figure out the programming. Because the programming could be inadvertantly corrupted by pressing the asterisk (*) or pound (#) keys, I made a little cover that prevents access to the bottom three keys. Sadly, my battery recently died and I cannot now locate the instructions."
3,Weird combinations,"This product is very weird and the instructions suck. To mount it on the wall with BOTH screws you have the take the entire thing apart. The other one is ez. Now back to how weird the product is, you put a 4 digit combination and press anything and the door opens. WTF anything.... After that u can press anything and the door will close/open(opposite) by pressing ANYTHING (except #/*)the instructions says 15 seconds but if u count its more like 1 min. by that time you might be robbed. =) If you do buy this product have fun. And the 9v batter connector is like crap. just thought you might want to know. And good job for actually reading all of this."
2,Great when it works,This product keeps loosing its programming. I have changed the batteries and reprogrammed several times. It will work after reprogramming for a few weeks and will loose the programming again for no reason. This unit is not exposed to water or extreme temps. I would not recommend.
2,It worked ok... but after 4 years we need to replace it,"We've had this about 4 years. The last time the battery died, it would no longer work to open to doors. We're replacing it, but not getting another Clicker. There is no reason for it to die after so few years."
5,A gem of a book about a gem of an island,"WOW! What a beautiful book! Right from the beginning it is clear that this author has experienced all aspects of this island, not just by looking around, but by living it. It is quite obvious that he has actually been suspended from the climbing rocks he describes and has gone scuba diving in the ocean surrounding Cayman Brac to share the breathtaking sea life around the island. He has personally explored the caves and hiked the trails on the island for years. He definitely knows his subject and takes great pride and affection in sharing his knowledge and love of Cayman Brac with those who are lucky enough to find this book.This is an informative guide that is also a pleasure to look at. After reading this book, I'm ready to hop on a plane and head straight for Cayman Brac!!!"
3,Nice but very pale pink,It almost looks like these where left out in the sun and bleached a little. Still it's a good trivet - generous in size and textured so the pot doesn't slide. I just wish the color was a little deeper. Only reason for 3 stars is the color. More towards white than pink.
2,Not so impressed,"I ordered this watch knowing that it was cheap, and that the quality of the brand, whose tendency to produce low quality watches, was well noted I purchased this watch which was damaged when I received it thankfully I was able to repair it myself which was not so much the sellers fault but the design of this watch was flawed be advised this is not an end all solution to your watch needs but if you like the style and don't wear it that often, interchanging and rotating between two or more watches, then it will last a lot longer"
3,"Ok, if a bit repetitive","I read it because I wanted to know where antisemitism came from and this book mostly answers that question, or at least offers one viewpoint. Tries to boil it down to four key reasons and then elaborates on each of those reasons.I purchased and read this book before learning of the conservative view of Prager, and now I can see that in a lot of the comments (e.g. maligning the Jewish left). It comes out very much as having a bone to pick with certain targets and it was in those chapters/passages that I could see what they were up to and just breezed ahead to the next section that wasn't so biased.A decent background into the question but be advised of the bias within."
3,Good overview over roots and causes of anti-semitism but very ideological,"The authors provide a clear overview of the roots of anti-semitism and why it is so widespread throughout the world. That is why it is worth buying. I like how they cover how anti-semitism plays out in different social and religious groups. The book also demystifies some common ""explanations"" for anti-semitism like commercial superiority or ""jews killed jesus"" as not going to the root causes of anti-semitism. The book becomes too ideological when providing solutions and when describing the situation in the Land of Israel or when bashing so-called ""self-hating jews""."
2,Ducking the Issues,"I disagree with these Jewish authors' stated reasons for antisemitism. The five principal reasons I believe are 1) greed and overreach based on Judaism and Jewish culture, e.g., provisions of the Talmud make non-Jews inhuman and authorize theft and robbery of Gentiles. 2) The offensiveness (to others) of the idea that Jews view themselves as the chosen people of God, with all the rights and entitlements that would imply. 3) Jealousy and envy of Jews' superior intelligence, capabilities and also their wealth. 4)The notion that Jews caused Jesus to be killed, as far as Christians are concerned. 5)And Jews efforts to dominate the thinking and actions of others in many contexts where their interests are also involved. The matter is not difficult or complicated. The authors too much dance around the issues and the history of the Jews. The matter of antisemitism is relatively simple, in my view."
5,Making sense of the insensible.,"A non-Jewish professional colleague of mine asked me the question posed in the title, ""Why the Jews?"" I postulated the same erroneous cliche's of being an easily scapegoated minority, being education-centric, being affluent, being money-lenders, being different, etc. All answers with which I was disastisfied as incorrect, incomplete, or untrue. Rabbi Telishkin and Mr. Prager's book concisely, clearly and skillfully analyzes the root causes of antisemitism (ethical monotheism, moral law, peoplehood) and debunks all the easy or contrived answers. A great book, and a must read for all."
5,Totally Awesome,"I normally dont write reviews. I only read them. But this time I can't help myself ...The first time I heard the Saturate album, was at Bible Camp this summer, where Jeff Deyo himself, performed live. And I must say that I was hooked right away.The worship concert was like being a part of the Sonicpraise album ... totally amazing.I got the chance to talk to him afterwards, getting his autograph on my newly bought Saturate Album :)This CD will fit anyone's cd rack. Or i could say it like this: if you'r cd rack doesn't have Jeff Deyo: Saturate, it's not complete!!!GREAT EXPERIENCE, GREAT ALBUM ... GET IT BEFORE YOUR NEIGBOUR!"
2,A Disappointment,"Following up Sonicflood's successful debut with a solo debut, Deyo's ""Saturate"" sounds like the same song played 14 times over. I found his praise lyrics irritatingly monotonous. Perhaps Deyo should consider resourcing a Bible more than a thesaurus. This CD is very superficial, lacks spiritual depth, and uses the personal pronouns (or derivations thereof) ""I"" or ""me"" over 200 times. Shouldn't a worship CD be more about ""He"" and ""Him""? Jeff spends a lot of time longing for Christ, burning for Him, yearning for Him, wanting, needing, but rarely answers why.Pet peeve: Quit talking on your CDs. I buy CDs to listen music, not preaching."
5,Excellent,"Before purchasing this DVD, I had heard of Dottie Pebbles but I really did not know who she was. Well, let me tell you; after watching this video and listening to the great songs. You will know who she is and where she is from. A very sweet woman with an electrifying voice. This video is a must have if you like great gospel music. We need more, more, more, gospel music on DVD.Regards,Kelvin Lyons"
1,This edition contains only half the text.,"A Tramp Abroad is a great book. Unfortunately this edition (BiblioLife, 2010) only includes the second half of the text."
4,Mark Twain is our tramp abroad as he travel the Europe of 1880!,"A Tramp Abroad is the third and least successful of the travel books written by the pen of Mark Twain.In this book we follow Twain as he tours Germany, Italy, France and Switzerland. I found the early chapters chronicling his visit to Heidelburg University; hilarious visits to opera houses and tale tales such as the Blue Jay yarn to be well done.The longest section of the book deals with Twain's alpine climbing adventures in Switzerland. This material is interesting but goes on a bit too long for the modern reader.This is a fine book and deserves to be read and enjoyed by a wider readership that better known but lesser Twain novels andtravel writing,I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys listening to a great author recount his peregrinations through Europe in a leisurely and informative manner."
3,"Disappointed after liking ""The Innocents Abroad""","I listened to the audio version of both books, and will admit up front that the narrator for this one is not one of my favorites, but I got past that after a while.Twain seemed to be ""padding"" the narrative with an awful lot of folktales and legend, rather than his own experience. There's a lengthy (and highly annoying) ""fantasy"" sequence - I suppose he was trying for parody - as well. I found myself fast-forwarding through almost a full cassette of a gory description of two deuls (near the beginning); he delights in recounting grisly mountaineering stories later on during the novel. The storyline ended abruptly at the end of cassette 11 of 13; the last two were the appendix, which I skipped.I really liked ""Innocents"" and am planning on purchasing ""Following the Equator"" (I looked through it at a bookstore and it seemed pretty interesting), but I wish I'd skipped this one. Three stars for the humor when he actually describes his own experiences."
1,"Great Book, But Don't Buy Quill Pen Classics Version","First of all, this is a great book that has made me laugh countless times. I live in Germany and Mark Twain's observations are so insightful and witty that this book is truly timeless.I give one star to the 2008 version published by ""Quill Pen Classics."" The typesetting in this book is atrocious. It's like someone printed it on their home computer. It is an uneven eyesore and very unpleasant to read. Actually the cover of mine looks like the one available for the Kindle version, but it is a 2008 version from ""Quill Pen Classics."" Apparently this company takes books in the public domain and sells overpriced, poor quality versions of them. $16.95 is a crime both to the consumer and to Mark Twain.I will not buy another book from ""Quill Pen Classics"" without looking inside first. I suggest you do the same."
1,Paperback of poor quality,I purchased the paperback version of the book. The binding is of exceedingly poor quality. The first pages fall out one by one as they are read. I expect the book itself to be very good. Don't buy the paperback.
3,Interesting alternative to Twain's classic novels & stories,"Follows Twain's odyssey during and extensive European vacation in the late 1800s. One must pay attention at times to separate the pure fantasy-humor from actual experiences and observations. The book jumps around quite a bit and has no consistent theme, but Twain's writing skills, imagination and imagery are wonderfully on display. If you were only going to read one Twain book, this should not be your choice. But as ""another side"" of Twain, it was interesting and entertaining."
2,"Poor proof reading,","Excellent writers also have bad days. The travel accounts are often repetitive.I have not seen a paper copy of this book so I wonder,where are the pictures mentioned throughout the book? Add poor proof reading, and you get stuff like this that another reviewer wrote for a different book: ""I too would like to mention the FACT that emphasized WORDS are all CAPITALIZED in this version as AMAZINGLY annoying."" I confess I skimmed over a LOT of this book."
4,Nice spatula,I like this spatula and the shovel-type blade. You can actually use this as a spoon for lighter cake batters (like angel food cake) It's a good weight and has a nice handle. The only thing I don't like is the connections on the handle. It's not an integrated piece but separate components that are fit together. Food can get trapped in between the parts.
5,Silicone spoon spatula,"This KitchenAid Cook for the Cure pink spatula is everything I was looking for! It is very good quality, sturdy and the perfect length and size. I also love the look of it! I use it every single day and it cleans up so easily. I really love it!"
1,Duh!,"Was this book about an interracial couple, if not why was it listed in the interracial category?"
3,"beautiful pictures, useless text","The author writes in a tone as if her taste is the absolute taste. Some images are inspiring, but the text is next to useless. This book definitely overcites designer names, the miss spelling of foreign phrases is irritating as well. If you're searching for idea to decorate your own house, look somewhere else."
3,you should only rent this game,"I got this game a few days ago, and it has great graphics, and the music is creepy, but in a good way. when i first got this game, i thought it would be like the spiderman games: just action and roaming the city. i was wrong. In this game, there are certain levels where u can roam the streets, but not many. Also, this game is complete stealth. If u try to sneak up on a guy who has a gun, and get caught, 5 shots and your DEAD. Overall, the action is great, but the stealth part is EXTREMLLY hard and if u die, u have to start at your last checkpoint, and there are not many checkpoints in a level. I would only recommend this game to people who are great at stealth videogames, and enjoy waiting 5 fricken minutes for a guy to turn around, so u can use steath on him."
4,batman begins a great game,"Batman Begins is great, short, but yet real fun! you can enter a stealth mode so that the bad guys cant see you then make an awsome combat move, you can use smoke grendans and a sonic bomb which can summon bats the scare the crap outta the bad guys. But whats fustrating is you have to scare the bad guys so that they drop their guns cause then your dead. you scare then by throwing your bat -a-rang at objects and doing other stuff that makes them frightned. it follows the story line from the movie nothing else. its a great game, i found my self playing it again and again, cause i beat it so quickly since its so short, since it was short i just needed more batman so i kept on playing it new game after new game, if your not a big batman fan rent this game, if you are a big batman fan buy this game other then that peace out..."
3,Rotisserie Chicken - store-bought - recipes,Rotisserie Chicken - store-bought - recipes. That is not what I wanted. I wanted recipes for cooking food on a rotisserie in my grill.
5,Hallucinogenic Recipe,"I'm a big fan of jazz and not much interested on electronic music. But the lounge music really makes me feel good, because of it's variety and complexity.This album is a must buy for every fan of good and relaxing music, specially if listened after a long work day, having a cigar, laying back and looking at your stereo...Disc 2 is, in my opinion, the best, on account of it's elaborated songs. The album concept is fantastic and it even comes with comic book inside.Worth every penny!"
5,Inspired weirdness that gets better and better...,"Uneasy listening? This can only refer to the way some tracks are compiled/mixed together by 45 Dip, which at first is a bit challenging in places. But what do you expect from a double cd that describes itself as being banned in 7 countries, 12 planetary systems and the 9th dimension? This is not your average downtempo compilation.Soon enough, this weird blend of latin, lounge and other undescribable stuff starts to make a lot of sense, and I am now hooked. Three of 45 Dip's own tracks are included and they stand out within a consistently high quality selection."
2,interesting,"i work in a ce store in the seattle area and we sell quite a lot of these subs. the key to their success has to be the price (150 USD) which surpasses any of the competition when you are in the market for two twelves and an enclosure. having heard them daily for the last year i'd have to say they put out a decent sound. the blue lights are also cool but most people don't realize they have to be hardwired for power. my only qualm with the unit is that they're not very reliable. many come back blown. if you buy these, buy some kind of warranty as well. it's completely worth it when you consider the money you've saved by buying this package."
1,Poor quality,"Amazon doesn't show the connection plug.Assuming Terk hasn't upgraded their design from the one I have, the quality is very poor. My plug is not solid; rather, it is a circle of thin flanges, which quickly break."
1,Sir Mini connector,I aLso received the antenna with the brown plug that wouldn't fit my Sirius model. The ad was misleading and appears everyone is having the same issue.
1,wrong antenna,"wrong antenna did'nt and would not fit the radio. E-mailed said it was the wrong one, ask for a exchange, no responce."
4,"Good reception, Great price.","Like the other reviews, the only real problem is that strange light brown plastic piece over the connector plug (note: you can not see it in the picture that amazon provides). Just carefully cut it off then your good to go. All in all it's a great value for the price."
1,poor quality sirius roof antenna,"FEB 7, 2011THE PRODUCT WAS NOT AS ADVERTISED, I.E. POOR QUALITY. I RETURNED IT TO THE SELLER & REQUESTED A REFUND.TO DATE I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THE SELLER & I RETURNED THE ITEM 1 WEEK AGO?!! IT COST ME $10.00 TO RETURN IT!!"
2,"Excellent reception, but poor build quality","This antenna worked perfectly for me for exactly 30 days. At that point, I kept getting ""Antenna Not Detected"" messages on every receiver I tried. When I examined the plug that connects to the receiver, I noticed that a tiny cylinder of metal inside the plug had fallen out. It's gone, now, and without that piece to make contact, the antenna is useless.Be VERY careful when connecting or disconnecting this antenna from a receiver, as this piece is VERY easy to break, and you will be left with a useless piece of equipment.While it WAS functioning, however, it performed its job quite nicely."
3,Antenna signal,well I had to change my 1st generation anteena it died. so they left me no choice but to use these type. Not too impressed I have more drop/lost singals I needed a bigger antenna. I guess bigger is better.
4,Terk SIR-MINI Roof Antenna,"Works great.Had to remove the brown plastic fitting from the antenna wire that encased the actual metal connector to the cradle.Other reviews pointed this out so it wasn't a big deal, just had to be done carefully."
3,First one was defective,The first one I received was defective. The second one worked fine. I've seen others complain of poor quality.
5,"Wow, I'm surprised to see this here...","And even more surprised to see some reviews...I think Gedge has crafted some amazing lyrics, best exemplified on ""Blue Eyes"" and ""Three"", in the typical boy-girl relationship breakup theme. I also really enjoy the jangly-guitar-with-feedback style of their music.This stands alone as one of the finer moments of early 90's angsty new-wave-alternative genres."
5,Best Weight Training Gloves,"I have tried other weight training gloves like Valeo and Harbinger. But none of those comes close to the Altus gloves. The fit, the comfort and the styling is really good. These gloves are worth the money. Those other gloves don't have the cushion or comfort that you get from these gloves. I would recommend these gloves to anyone who is looking to buy weight training/lifting gloves."
4,Great workout gloves,"I bought two of these gloves, one for myself and one for my friend. i haven't used mine yet but my friend did, he is very happy with it. I tried it on my hand though, good paddings over the palm, just difficult to remove from my hand, too tight. I wear usually medium, so I ordered medium but it seems the size is smaller."
5,Soldiers brave and true,"An oversized, handsomely illustrated look at the Civil War, with emphasis on the soldiers themselves - camp life, uniforms, weapons, etc. Perhaps the most interesting and rewarding chapter, because it is so rarely dealt with in most other books about the war, is the one entitled ""Willing Spirits & Weak Flesh,"" all about the sordidness of army life: drunkenness, prostitution, theft, and insubordination, among many other miseries. An excellent book that focuses on the human side of war, not the politics, the generalship, the maneuvering. An excellent addition to anyone's Civil War library."
5,A handy family reference!,I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to save a doctors visit for minor ailments. I have used several of his suggestions and they have worked...every time. It's age old advice even my grandmother agrees with.
3,Digital Compass,"The system is a battery eater, especially in colder weather. Not a good choice for Minnesota's winters. Like the displays."
1,Waste of space and money,"Cons: Too bulky, not designed for car. No wireless outside temp sensor. No instructions on how to set up and read barometer. An alarm clock?? In a car?? What the heck for??? How about an altimeter instead??Pros: Good for bedside clock. Gives you quick weather forecast when it wakes you up in the morning. Compass can help orient you toward the bathroom.Bottom line: I'd rather save my money for a real multi-function compass/barometer/altimeter watch which I can take with me anywhere."
3,"Maybe a good book for professionals, but not for me.","My therapist let me borrow his copy of this book when he first started treating me. If anything, this book was more upsetting to me than helpful. I went ahead and gave it three stars because I think if you were a professional trying to get a grasp of what was going on in the head of someone who self injures then this book would be helpful. But for me the graphic descriptions of the abuse the women in the book suffered was a bit much, especially while trying to process my own issues. Plus it did not offer me any true insight into my own problems with self injury, or any guidance as to how to stop. I think the main thing I got out of it was that at least if my therapist had read this he was attempting to understand self injurious behaviour, which was more than most therapists I'd encountered had attempted to do."
1,Complete Rip Off,"Do not waste your money on this product. The shipping weight is described as 2.5lbs. That would indicate multiple products. There was only one tube and it was below five inches in length. I checked the weight on a digital scale. It read 0.35lbs. Most of that weight is packaging. Again, do not waste your money on this product."
2,Could be better,I wasn't overly impressed with the flavor of these. I was expecting a delicious beefy snack and it ended up being kind of bland and tough to chew. I might order again just to see if I happened to get a bad one. Would like to see this in spicy buffalo or teriyaki flavors.
5,The Fourth Angel,"WOW, Fantastic, Acurate, Thrilling, Incredible. This book has got to be one on the best I have ever read. I am an avid reader of Patrica Cornwell, Steven King, and Jeffrey Archer and Suzanne has hit the spot with this one. I have spent 25 years as a firefighter and 11 of those as Fire Chief, this book describes the heart and sole of the firefighters and the officers. The intra-departmental bickering and prodding is perfectly described and it fits any large city fire department, just change the names and it fits. After the first paragraph of the book, you will not put it down. The description of the first stages of fire are so accurate, so real, it will raise the hair on your neck. She is to be commended for accuracy!! I have never read a 400 page paperback in 6 nights until I picked up this book. I can hardly wait to find ""Flashover"". I can only hope that is this well written."
3,Stimulating,"First read this classic years ago but I find myself returning to it time and again when I read a book on one of the battles Seymour covers. I go back and forth, staying slightly ahead in Seymour so I can feel a little of what the original commander felt trying to determine what's on the other side of the hill with limited information. Some have wondered why he chose the battles he did or, rather, did not choose more famous encounters. The criterion for a work like this is a battle with several decision points on both sides. So not just any battle will do. I especially like the practice of many small maps instead of one overly-detailed map. It enables one to follow the flow of the battle much better. The major fault with this book is probably the ""traditional"" viewpoint for at least some of the subject matter. ""Old school"" errors and prejudices poke through annoyingly for the American Civil War battles and even Waterloo. Still, worth a read--more than once."
3,I really wanted to like this,"I still do kind of like this, it's really pretty. I love the decoration on the end. Unfortunately, I don't think it works for my hair type. The third time I put it in my bun, the piece on top broke off completely. I wish they were a bit sturdier and a bit longer. I wish they came in varying lengths, in general. The end will get lost in your hair if your bun is bigger than average."
1,very disapointed,Book arrive in bad condition and stained. I also checked too late the book from the editor which was proposed at half price and in new condition!
3,Impressions 2 fr,"I love Curtis Mayfield and the impressions butthese two cds are ok as a whole but I don't considerthem to be their best. I purchased this cd 2fr forone cut. 'Moon light shadows', in my openion theirbest track from the mid 60s. That track was notpulled for a single release though."
1,Available for Free on Web,"The publishers have found a unique way to make money - they take something that was produced by the government, slap a price on it and ship it out. If I had done more careful research, I would have realized that this product was available on the web at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory web site. In fact, an updated version is available for download.The work itself provides a general overview of various technologies, along with the developments and projections as to how that technology might be deployed in the future. It may be influenced by the priorities of the administration in power - this version gives a lot of play to the ""hydrogen economy"" that the administration is pushing."
4,Cheese wars!,"Magdelena Yoder, Mennonite proprietess of the PennDutch Inn and her less-than-reverent sister, Susannah, take to the road as they travel to Farmersburg, Ohio for the funeral of their second cousin twice removed. This unfortunate man was found floating, nude, in a milk tank on his dairy farm. Magdalena knows that any self-respecting Amish man would never be found in this compromising position, and she grows more suspicious when she discovers that one of his partners died under suspicious circumstances during the previous week. A conflict seems to center around competitors who are trying to produce the best Swiss cheese in the area. Susannah has a romance with the head of the competition's business and Magdelena fears that her sister's life is in danger. The web of evidence grows until Magdelena is kidnapped by the murderer who has her pegged as the next victim. Fans of the Pennsylvania Dutch books will enjoy this 3rd. novel of the series."
2,Silly Fare!,"I really enjoyed the first book in this series, and the second one was OK, but not as good as the first, but this one was just terrible! I gave it two stars instead of one because I know that Ms. Myers is capable of much better than this. This book is poorly written and poorly edited. There are glaring mistakes in it, and the plot is so loose that you could drive a truck through it. The last few chapters are truly terrible, and rather than feeling anything for the main characters, I just wanted to finish the book. I will read one more in this series and if it's as bad as this I will not continue. I did enjoy the first in her Den of Antiquity series, and will continue with that one unless the same thing happens with that one that has happened here. It appears that Ms Myers is trying to make a slapstick comedy, and it falls flat."
1,Just Plain Awful!,"This book is just plain awful. Ms. Myers started out with a nice idea and produced an acceptable first book. But the rest have been trash. They are badly written, poorly edited and they are just plain silliness (and not in a cute/funny way)! There are far to many inconsequential characters clogging up the storylines, the most extreme overuse of a word that I have ever seen (wailing), and too many references to being one's own relative. I can't believe her books get 3, 4 and even 5 star ratings from readers. I will never trust the rating scale again."
3,Had to call technical support to make it work.,"After 30 minutes of trying with no result, I called Technical Support. We re-tried everything, and then they suggested putting the switches in the opposite positions as documented. It then worked. They might spend an additional $0.02 on documentation and save everyone time. It worked flawlessly after that."
3,Programming a remote,"I had a little trouble programing this remote as my garage door is an older variety. I found the company who makes it to be very helpful and answered my questions. I have not yet programmed the second ""button"" but anticipate it to be easier."
2,doesn't work for mine,"I moved into a house with a 10 year old Craftsman opener. It has a smartlearn button and everything, but this remote just won't learn from it no matter what I do. Others were fine, but this one doesn't like me. I'm sure it's great, but doesn't work for me"
1,Does not operate Wayne-Dalton Garages,"This so-called universal remote does not operate wayne- dalton garages, and it is not listed on the dreadfully long automated customer no service call!! This remote SUCKS!!"
1,So much for universal,"I bought this to replace a Stanley Multi-Code remote (10 dip switches). It doesn't work. Although the packaging states NOT compatible with Stanley Secure-Code it did not say anything about incompability issues with Multi-Code systems. But after a couple hours of frustration (reversing the dip switches, using different dip switches for different remote brands, flipping DIP switches 11 and 12 to both OFF/ON and combinations thereof), I am convinced that this thing does not work on Multi-Code systems. The packaging needs to be a lot more clear about this."
2,Not very universal; packaging could use some clarification!,"The packaging is pretty unhelpful about which systems it will and won't control. Unfortunately, our 12-switch DoIt (non-Intellicast) is one of the ones it won't. Back it goes!"
1,how does it work?,"would be very cool and i think smart to show how it might work.i shouldn't complain about its site. i have yet to go to one toreally know if it would work.probably would be a good idea to set up the site by lettingabout 50 ""normal"" people figure out how they should try and buy one. Give each a different remote.i bet their sales would skyrocket. cause nobody else is doing it"
1,Clicker is going downhill,I've had a Clicker 321 for years and it finally broke. I replaced it with the CLT1D. But it doesn't work. There is no 0 setting on this new one. So the directions tell you to go back and change the settings on the receiver side.That is ridiculous. I can't change the receiver in our community. So this P.O.S. goes back right away.Clicker has no remotes now that work with Chamberlain or Sears.
2,Clicker did not work for me,"I have an older model Sears garage door opener, and the Clicker had the same dip switches, but this Clicker opener would not work with my Sears Garage Door Opener."
4,"Works like a charm, just a little big","The remote works great and was easy to program.The only issue is that it seems a little big. Our other remote that came with the garage door was small.This one is quite large comparatively. It still fits fine in the car, but I wish it were just a tad bit smaller."
4,The clicker that works,Since I moved into my house I have had to buy universal remotes. I have purchased a couple and have found that the clicker clicker is the easiest to set up and easiest to use.
1,Does NOT work with Craftsman / Liftmaster / Security+,"If you use any of the Craftsman openers (chamberlin, Liftmaster, Craftsman, Security+, etc...) do NOT get this opener. I fought it for DAYS trying to get it to work with my existing opener. It would either work on it's own, or the old GDO would work, but not together. Turns out that it somehow ""takes over"" so unless you want to buy a whole new set of openers, dont' bother. Go with the Craftsman Security+ GDO. Works great! Solved all my problems, unlike this POS."
1,Not working,Although this item was still in it's packaging as new and listed as compatible with my garage door opener it did not work. I'm positive that I set the programmable switches correctly and I've tried other possible combinations with no luck.
3,Universal Garage Door Opener,This was easy to program and setup and works very will with my Chamberlain garage door opener. The only problem is that it cannot manage two different doors unless the garage door openers are exactly the same model. I was disappointed that it could only be tuned to one set of keys.
1,check its size,"the size is way too big. don't be fooled by the photo. It did not come with the updated instruction, I have to call technic support - which you got automatic answering again and again and could not get a real person or the help I needed. finally I emailed and they sent the new instruction for my Chamberlain opener and it worked. but the huge size is definitely an issue."
1,Be forewarned!!!,"This remote will NOT support a multicode remote, as the previous CLT1 would. It took me several tries to figure it out, only to finally retrieve my old paperwork from the CLT1, (thank G-D I had saved!), only to find out that this newer model does not do all that the older model did. If you have a multicode remote, this remote will NOT work!!"
4,Good survey of Afghanistan since 1996,"An excellent series of essays by veteran watchers of Afghanistan with much recent experience on the ground. Goes beyond the myths often repeated in daily papers. Impartial and rigorous on the Taliban and the nature of its support. The best book on post-1996 Afghanistan. I've written three books on Afghanistan myself, so I know a little of the subject."
3,Great smell but not blond enough,This smelled wonderful and left my hair feeling soft but it wasn't enough to turn my light brown hair blond. This also left my hair a little brassy. I think I need to get an ash blond color to counteract the already given hues in my hair.
3,Lightened my medium-light auburn hair with dark brown roots..,"Lightened my medium-light auburn hair with dark brown roots, But made my roots a light orange blonde and a darker orange for the rest! I look crazy!!!!! :("
2,Turned my hair yellow,"I am a natural dirty blonde, and I wanted to go lighter. I tried this product, and my hair turned bright yellow. I had to rush to the salon to get it fixed"
3,Much plainer than appears,"Is a very simple, very inexpensive book, both in price and appearance. I got is as a gift for a teenage girl, and just had to go find a decent looking book for her to pen her final songs into, as this will never be a collectors item of any sort. But it does deliver what it promises for the money."
3,Out of Love,"Amazing what men will do out of love for women. Denzel sticks his foot in it this time when he falls in love with a woman he is having an affair with. As a sheriff he should know better. To complicate matters she makes him her life insurance beneficiary and he gives her money from a drug bust so she can leave her husband. See any complications here? Yeah, like walking in a mine field dragging a huge rake while wearing a blindfold. The additional features are okay and the DVD quality is good. Whether you buy it not be sure to catch this one. The scenery in Florida is great and the acting is quite good."
3,Marginal plot,"Just ok.... certainly not one of Washington's better ones. Eva Mendes needs diction lessons, mumbles a lot of her lines. The plot is a stretch. All in all.... ho hum..."
2,Disappointing,This movie was just alright with me. It had a few funny parts when Denzel frantically erases his phone entries (fax machine scene). I thought he'd piss his pants. There's almost zero action here. The movie was kinda boring actually. If you must see this movie then rent it instead (you'll thank yourself later)
3,A good date movie.,"A good date movie. Sanaa going toe to toe with the great one, Denzel. Do your thang girl!"
4,"Entertaining ""B"" neo-noir film","Denzel Washington makes any movie good, even a standard whodunit.I watched this movie while suffering from a cold and it totally took my mind off my aching head.John Billingsly was a scene-stealer as the M.E. I hope to see him in more films...maybe Denzel will team up again with him; they had great chemistry.This is a great rainy Saturday afternoon movie!"
2,Out of Time,"Matthias ""Matt"" Lee Whitlock is chief of police in Banyan Key, Flordia. Matt is secrectly seeing Ann Harrison and he is also going through a divorce with Alex Whitlock who is a homicide detective. Matt learns that Ann has cancer and Ann rewards Matt by making him the only beneficiary of her life insurance policy. Later Ann's house with her and abusive husband Chris are killed when their house explodes. Throughout the movie Matthias does all this crazy stuff like erasing the the calls he made to her so the police don't find out. I just didn't really like this movie. It didn't get interesting until an hour into and fell apart at the end with and ending some might call ""a twist"" but if it was, it was rather stupid. Denzel Washington could do way better. The plot is easy to figure out and this has been done before. Glad I didn't buy this movie."
2,Out of Time leaves nothing to question,"Denzel Washington, an actor that most would agree is very good at what he does, has no room to do anything exciting in an very bland suspense movie. The whole movie is just going from one close call to another, all in order to save his neck. Sure, there is a dabbling with a former relationship and an emphasis on his current one, but there is no interest there. If you like thinking will he make it for the whole movie, while the question is more like will he make it for what? Then okay, watch it, but otherwise it is not worth buying, maybe just renting, once."
2,Alright movie,"By the preview, you know what's going to happen. That said there are very few surprises. It flows, but it's anything from great. Washington is ok, but he's been in much much better movies."
3,No Suspense in a Movie Which Claims to Be a Suspense Film,"This movie didn't offer much for me. I have always liked Denzel Washington, but I would certainly call this one of his weaker projects. He should fire the agent that got him this role immediately. The characters are for one, as the other reviewers have mentioned, quite forgettable. Filled with predictable outcomes and typical bad guy/good guy scenarios, I was never at the edge of my seat. And with a title like ""Out of Time"", I was hoping I would be. I just don't like movies that I can figure out before they are through. Movies that use sex appeal as their only means of entertainment. I mean sex appeal is nice in a movie, but it has to have a plot, as well! Not one of Denzel's better performances here, I was disappointed."
3,"Rent it, maybe, but don't waste your money on a purchase","Not a bad movie, however I regret the purchase. This one doesn't live up to its promotional billings."
3,"Decent, but not great","This movie starts out pretty slow and feels like it's dragging. About the middle of the movie, things start to make sense and you realize what kind of trouble Denzel's character has gotten himself into. Unlike the other reviewer, I did not find it predictable. At the same time, I didn't find this movie at all what I expected. The cover art only represents a few seconds of the movie. It's a good movie, but not great. I would have given it another star if it was about 15 or 20 minutes shorter as this would have increased the pace/intensity. The blu-ray transfer was also good, but again, nothing great. In sum, I could watch it a few times, but it is not so great that you could watch it many times."
2,A so so Denzel Washington effort,"I found, Out of Time to be ok and not really that interesting. Seemed like it had potential to be better but got a little confused in the middle of the movie and really did not keep my attention well from the beginning to the end. Probably only for the die hard D. Washington fan.Peter J. Miller"
4,Edge of your sit drama,Very suspenseful drama. Denzel Washington of course had a great preformance. I liked it and you will too.
3,a decent action packed thriller,"A very good Denzel Washington film, a little obscure but it is a mystery action thriller which had me wondering about the characters until the end. Dramatic, well acted and a good. Lots of backstabbing, lying and someone being set up. Or are they?"
3,"Average, a bit forced.","Washington is one of Hollywood's go to men, he can do it all. Ok, but still I want a stronger script and a stronger story. I'm not saying this film wasn't entertaining, it was, but it was hardly the edge of the seat thriller it made itself out to be.I'll give it a recommendation to rent, it's entertaining, but beyond that, I can't say much."
3,BE THANKFUL THAT DENZEL WAS THE STAR OF THIS MOVIE,"A POLICE CHIEF [DENZEL WASHINGTON] IS SECRETLY SEEING A WOMAN [SANAA LATHAN]. WHEN SHE IS MURDERED, HE FINDS THAT HE IS ONE OF THE PRIME SUSPECTS. THIS MOVIE BENEFITS FROM THE LIKABLE PERFORMANCE FROM DENZEL WASHINGTON. THIS MOVIE'S BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THAT IT MOVES TOO SLOW. BUT THE SHOCKING ENDING DEFINITELY HELPS THE MOVIE OUT IN A BIG WAY. IT'S AT LEAST WORTH A RENTAL."
3,A good thriller but a small movie for Denzel Washington !,"After watching TRAINING DAY, i just expected Denzel Washington in great and difficult roles. OUT OF TIME is not bad but it's not a huge performance.The plot is alright even if I guess easily what it will happen next.It's quite predictable and I found it was close to ""NO WAY OUT"" released longtime ago (1987) with Costner and Hackman for those who remember this flick.The worst thing is the last scene at the end that is quite useless and laughable in my opinion.A little movie with a big star !"
3,No Way Out of Time,"Denzel Washington desperately trying to stay one step ahead of being discovered by the authorities was strongly reminiscent of Kevin Costner attempting the same in ""No Way Out"". I must say that, overall, this film was better than the Costner film.Still, it was underwhelming; much of it was predictable. Also, if the viewer who might be rooting for Denzel's character steps back for a minute, what he sees is a corrupt cop who doesn't deserve a happy ending. Just because he's Denzel and we all like Denzel (as we all like Tom Hanks and a few others) doesn't mean we should be sympathetic to his character (likewise John Billingsley's character, who was quirky and funny -- but also unethical and immoral).As long as I'm nitpicking, here's my favorite scene: Denzel's sexy ex-wife, kicking in the locked door to the men's room with the high heels that she wore with her tight skirt and the rest of her professional detective outfit. Yeah -- that's realistic."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...] - @tss5078,"Out of Time is entertaining but painfully predictable. 20 minutes into the movie i knew exactly what was going on. Chief Whitlock is not your typical Denzel role, and while he played it the best that he could, I just feel like it didn't suit him very well. The location of the movie didn't make a whole lot of sense, and that wasn't the only thing. Why would a detective from Miami and his ex-wife be investigating a crime an hour away in some small town? Miami PD isn't the FBI. The movie has a lot of plot holes and everything that happens is fairly obvious. It's entertaining, but it's not going to blow anyone away."
3,Out of Time AKA Serpent of Death,This has all the feeling of a Hallmark made for TV movie. The same mind numbing background music (only slightly worse than elevator music.)However even though you know the formula and pretty much can guess the ending it is still a pretty good time passer.Jake (Jeff Fahey) a student archeologist finds a clue to the legendary lost treasure of Alexander. He is reluctant to peruse the treasure until he is pushed from behind by being accused of stealing the artifact clue and pulled by the nose by a girl (Camilla More) that has a tendency to go to bed and show of her accoutrements at the drop of a hat.Will Jake find the treasure before the bad guys?Does Jake get to keep the sleazy girl?Will the bad guys triumph in the end?Or do we all live happily ever after.The main thrust of the movie is the chase as Jake and his friends snake their way around Egypt and Grease.Out of TimeSerpent of Death
4,A Hit For Washington,"I have no idea how well the film did at the box-office, but at home, watched via DVD and TV monitor, it was certainly a hit in my living room. Washington is at the center at all times even when he is not actually on screen. Its all for the best since his good-humored lusty young police chief unifies the plot and action providing the golden thread which holds the whole thing together. There is an adequate degree of suspense, a good deal of anything but straitlaced straight arrow behavior, and a good assortment of featured players for him to negotiate with, but in the end it is Washington's show. It is due to him that what might have been a hokey third rate cop in the hole show or a cheap lusty cop in bed and out sexpot ill-tasting stew, is turned into an almost James Garner can of humor-suspense-at heart good natured action film...with the barest minimum of shoot-'em-up bloodletting. I liked this one and I am pretty sure most of you would like it too."
3,"Not Denzel's time, but good!","I really wanted to see this movie,I liked it. It kept you guessing ,Denzel was good not his best as we've seen in the past . There are good twists which keeps you interested. You May ask Yourself why?what? a couple of times,but you won't doze off in this one,just to see the ending which you may or may not like, thats why it is three star's for me Enjoy... Murpt"
3,'Must've been a HUGE carrot dangling in front of him!,"It is obvious that Denzel was offered a pretty decent paycheck to participate in this ""thriller"". Playing a William Hurt-like character (Think ""Body Heat""), Washington falls victim to the oldest con job in history: a ""hottie"" with an abusive husband and a terminal illness. Seems as though, Washington's police chief ""Whitlock"" would've seen this one coming a mile away.Too many plot devices are thrown in and Washington miraculously manages to avoid what should be his fate.Perhaps, because it is the two-time Academy Award winner assaying the role, the moviemakers decided to opt against logic and, instead, allowed the ""hero"" to escape the inevitable in this mostly forgettable film."
4,Great steamy entertainment!,"Great scenery, steamy setting in south florida, some action and a little humor thrown in make for a very entertaining film."
1,"More like ""Waste of Time""",A great-looking tropical setting can't save this pedestrian stinker that would have been just so-so as a tv movie. With an absurd plot and characters this one barely hobbles to a finish. Everthing thats wrong with movies today. UGH!
2,How can a police chief be this stupid?,"I bought this dvd thinking it would be an enjoyable thriller. Instead my husband and I found ourselves repeatedly saying ""how could he go and do that, that was so stupid"". To be honest, seeing that he had been fooled was immediate and obvious. Rather than sharing the truth with his friend and his wife, he goes and does one stupid/criminal/incriminating thing after another. The fact that Denzel Washington gets out of this situation in tact is solely because of either a) luck or b) a friend covering up for him. eg..Good grief, how many police officers don't know their chief's cell phone number in a small town. When the old woman pointed him out he was wearing the same outfit as he was when he was prowling around the night before. It gets a heck of a lot worse. The only reason I give it two stars rather than one is pity because I generally like Denzel Washington as an actor."
4,awesome movie!,"I give this movie two thumbs up! Sorry to see some negative ratings on this movie and of course those ratings are so untrue, i have never seen a dull movie that denzel has made all of his movies are good and worth buying to look at again. a must see movie!"
2,Not Denzel's best - not even very good,"Denzel Washington is an incredible actor, including in this movie, but the story didn't do him justice. Denzel is a police chief in a small town in Florida. He appears to have been framed for the murder of a local woman, which is complicated by the fact that he was having an extramarital affair with her. I lost almost all interest in the story because I couldn't help but think that all of his problems would be solved if he weren't lying to his wife, running around with another woman, and trying to cover it all up. I wanted the moral fiber and character of Denzel in John Q or Remember the Titans. Even Denzel's ""evil character"" in Training Day was more believable. I saw this movie matinee, and I'm glad I didn't pay more to see it."
4,"Love, Action, Betrayal","I love the movie, it was action with a wist of scandal and betrayal. It gave me a rush at one point and left me confuse at other point. The husband and wife scan, lead me to beleive the husband was the master mine behind the scan, when it really was the wife. I enjoyed it and would watch it again but than I love watching Denzel Washington."
4,not bad,I didn't expect to like this film as much as I did. The creators did an excellent job in building suspense and providing surprise. Danzel Washington's performance is strong and believable. Don't miss this one.
3,What is this?,"Okay, this ""thiller"" quote,unquote was predictable and slow and waste of 1 hour and fourty-five minutes of my life. I saw the ending coming from a mile away. Although Denzel did the best with what he was given, this film was not his best work. Not the actors fault, by any means, just pourly written. The only reson why I gave this movie three stars, was because a terrific actor like Denzel, put his name on this...stuff for lack of a better word. Also this beautiful women by the name of Eva Mendez, an up-coming rising star herself. can't really tell you anything about he plot, or I'll give the whole thing away. Like I said before, the actor/ress did the best they could with the lousy script they were given. So, I will continue to go see their movies and cross my fingers that the rest of their movies are much better than this film. Don't give up Eva! I'm sure that better scripts will turn up soon!!"
3,Star power,"Denzel is always worth the price of admission, but ""Body Heat"" did it better than this exercise in betrayal. Still worth a dvd night."
4,A good whodunnit,"Nice to see Denzel Washington go low key. OUT OF TIME is a terrific little movie for viewing at home - nice Florida Keys setting, good acting by Washington, Eva Mendes, Saana Latham, John Billingsley (especially), and Dean Cain (at long last in a bad guy role). This little potboiler has more to say about 'coincidence', misplaced trust, moral integrity or lack thereof, and the power of relationships to endure a lot of bruising than it has substance to drive a big story. What begins as a smalltown police chief weazling his way around another man's wife while still holding feelings for his own estranged 'new detectice' wife becomes a snappy stroll through the ins and outs of fraud, theft, lies, and murder. A great movie it is not, bu OUT OF TIME holds its own in the current DVDs available. And it is nice to watch Denzel Washington just do some ensemble acting. He is very good at it!"
4,Natural Atheism is a great intro to atheism,"This book is very, very good. Dr. Eller put in an incredible amount of thought and research into each topic that he covers. This book is full of very helpful information... everything from refuting the arguments for Gods existance to a short lesson in logic to a nice summary on the history of the whole church and state thing.The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was because I had a really hard time getthing through the second half of this book. The topics, while very informative, didn't really interest me that much. However, i still reccomend this book if you are interested in atheism, and would like to read a very thoughtful analysis of it, without any religion bashing."
2,"OK, but boring","I agree with the premises of this book, but found it rather boring, and not the easiest to read. If you want to read something similar that doesn't read like a textbook, I would suggest ""Losing Faith in Faith"", ""Atheist Universe"" or ""Like Rolling Uphill."""
4,Best season of the 4,"This was one of my favorite series I watched growing up. Season 4 was probably the best of all the seasons. Doogie ends up movie out of his parents house, has different experiances with various girls, as does his best friend Vinnie. I was disappointed with the very last episode on how it ended, and there were some scenes in some episodes there were kind of stupid, but in all its a very entertaining series I'm glad I have to my collection of dvd's."
1,Waste of Money,"This is terrible. I have the shark one. The connector piece is too short and barely fits on the hose. Once I finally get it on the water barely comes out and if I turn up the water it pops off the hose. After trying this 10 times, I have given up and my kids are now just playing with the water house. Did they even try out this thing before they decided to sell it? I'm taking mine back and I better get my money back!"
4,Great First Alarm Clock for Kids,"I bought this for my 5 year old son who started school this year. He is able to set the alarm himself and he really likes that he can press the snooze button to see the time during the middle of the night.My son also likes that a random sound wakes him every morning. Most of the sounds are funny or interesting (although one sound is a little scary). All in all this is a very kid-friendly alarm clock.With the help of this clock, my son has awakened on his own every morning without help. It is also reasonably priced. Thank you Timex!"
4,sounds the same,"I have all of Carlos' albums. I'd have to say I was probably expecting too much out of this one. Most of the songs sound too similar to past songs. I guess at a first try I was a bit bored. I do like Como tu and the fact that there is still some valleanto and rock. Interesting enough the play on words, rock de mi pueblo. Just an odd cultural observation!Anyway, the cd did not sound as fresh to me as I hoped, but maybe that will just grow...?"
4,The concert is great too!,"I live in Panama and two nights ago had the great pleasure of going to Carlos Vives' concert, on his ""Rock de mi Pueblo"" tour. If you have a chance to catch part of this tour, do so. His live act is marvelous, a great way to see him and all of his talented musicians in action. His love for Colombia and attachment to his musical roots are still strong and come across in every piece. This collection is not as traditional-sounding as his previous ones, but he's stretching and trying out new stuff, always with great musical talent and creativity. I just hope he doesn't stray too far from Colombia's beloved vallenato style and lose it in the process. I lived in Colombia in the 1990's, when his career was taking off, and to me, Carlos Vives IS Colombia. I hear him and I'm transported back to this most beautiful but badly maligned country. Que viva por siempre el amor de mi tierra!"
3,forgetting about his roots?,"Carlos Vives is being more of a rocker in this album, just like the title suggests. The songs are just OK, though up-beat, and I think his unique style has changed for the worse. He might be trying to emulate the success of fellow Colombian Juanes by jumping into a more mainstream kind of music. This is a rock-en-español CD with a touch of vallenato, cumbia and other Colombian beats. His previous CD's were quite the opposite -- vallenatos and cumbias played with electric guitars. Too bad that Vives went this way... didn't have to do it, he's already an icon everywhere in the world (except the U.S.)... I think he sold out in an effort to sell more CDs, maybe he wants to make it big in the U.S. in a cheesy-Miami kind of way."
3,Good....But not his best,"I love Carlos Vives, but his latest album is not his best. There are only 3 or 4 songs that are typical Carlos Vives songs, which envoke happiness and fond memories of Colombia.Either way, if you are a loyal fan like myself, buy the album. It won't disappoint.. Now if you want to buy a fantastic album, purchase his last, which is absolutely the best and I listen to it on a regular basis..."
3,Angel Diary,"To avoid marrying the king of hell, an angel princess goes to Earth-- as a schoolboy. She actually gets very into her role, complaining about the difficulty of hiding ""these useless breasts"" and fighting off the advances of her (male) friend and schoolmate. So far, the story shows a few of the princess's exploits and the angel kingdom's attempts to track her down. It's very cute, and I'm fond of the art. Also, the gender bending is pulled off so well that it appeals to my yaoi (boys-love) fetish. However, the plot is somewhat confusing, and not exactly deep to begin with. I'm going to be on the lookout for the next volume, though."
3,Highlight left out,"Entertaining footage and lively show, but ""Badge"", the best song of the album/concert was left out."
2,Eric Clapton: 24 nights,"Having read other reviews on this DVD,re picture quality, content and sound I do not think I would purchase the DVD considering the comments. The CD seems to be the one to buy and get quality for sound plus, from this fantastic musician and guitarist."
3,Surprisingly poor audio mix for a DVD! Save your money!,"Has anybody noticed the poor audio on this DVD? It's horribly compressed!Why would they use the audio mix from the original video as opposed to the mix that was used on the accompanying 2CD set release of ""Eric Clapton - 24 nights""?The CD-Set has a quite superb sound, but the DVD mix is almost unlistenable, everything is buried in the middle.For all purposes, DVD gives you the technology to make it sound even better than on the audio CD.WB hasn't even remixed the sound to Dolby Digital, that's how much care has been put into this (the picture could be better, too).I can only conclude this must have been one of the first DVD releases. Maybe I'm just spoiled by ""Hell freezes over"" but IMHO WB should correct this flaw![And one more thing WB: The days of 90 min. videos should be over; this release could have been expanded to double its size given the material available].A thorough disappointment!"
3,Excellent music but video lacks focus,"The musical performances in this video are very good; Clapton shows his blues guitar mastery on this soundtrack. The mediocre rating I give is due to the videography. The image quality is excellent but the editing stinks. My objections to the editing are twofold:1) The video tries to include other members of the band too often and the focus on Clapton is often lost. I bought the video to see CLAPTON.2) Video shots of some of the other band members show them ""getting into the music"" a little too much. In other words, it looks fake. I would even go so far as to call it ""hotdogging"".Compare this production to the much more straightforward but effective presentation of Stevie Ray Vaughan in the ""Live at the El Macombo"" video and you will see a glaring contrast.In summary, it is too bad that this excellent soundtrack was marred by its failure to focus adequately on its main attraction- ERIC CLAPTON!"
2,Clapton,"love the music, however the quality is incredibly poor. grainy and difficult to see with the dark stage lighting. would recommend you puchase the unplugged instead."
5,Slowhand at his best,"A great DVD, awesome sound. The four piece, blues and nine piece band sections are fantastic. The Orchestra songs don't work as well, I'd have much rather heard ""Bell Bottom Blues"" done by the blues band.This one was over too soon. I could listen to old Slowhand all night."
2,more misses than hits,"The DVD was just a copied VHS version, no 5.1, no additional features. Johnnie Johnson was good on the Blues set, but Cray and Guy just play backing parts. For diehard Claptonites only."
2,"24 Nights are ""Gone""","Instead of 24 Nights this DVD should be titled ""Gone"": Songs ""Badge"" and ""Hoodoo Man"", GONE; Steve Ferrone's drum solo in ""Sunshine of your love"", GONE. If you are looking for image, go for it, if you want sound and ""completeness"" do yourself a favor and buy the audio CD (2 CD Set)"
2,Buyer Beware,"This is NOT the ""sought after boxed set"" mentioned in the Product Description. In fact, it doesn't even contain all the cuts on the 24 Nights CD. As concert films go, it's only okay. But if you're expecting a geat deal on the complete boxed set, this isn't it."
2,grainy transfer from video to dvd,I don't know if this was a bootleg version or what but the quality of the dvd is substandard and barely watchable.
4,Return of the Wildman and Madman,"The first-time release of an early '80s tape featuring the one-man orchestra, pianist Bobby Enriquez, and the madcap prince of the alto, Richie Cole. Some more sober and somber jazz followers will regard four stars overly generous while others will get a bang out of this session. Look at the playlist (yes, that's ""Peg of My Heart""). Even though the date opens with Bird's best composition, ""Confirmation,"" this set is an eclectic, slightly over-the-top mix of everything--from Louis and Keely to Liberace, from bebop to bump & grind music. It's all a lot of fun, the perfect therapy for listeners anesthetized by Chris Botti or stretched to the limits of artistic pretentiousness by a CD collection overstocked with ""jazz"" recordings from ECM and Winter&Winter."
4,Outstanding!,Great choice of songs. B.J.'s voice is like no other . . . It's as though he is right there singing to you!
5,Excellent--nothing quite like it!,"This movie hooked me from start to finish. The acting was was excellent--Buck's genuine dysfunctional weirdness, Chuck's deadpan horror and annoyance of his former best friend, the kind but cynical lady who directs Buck's play, and Chuck's girlfriend who didn't fade into the background but held her ground.The story is basically an exploration of those of us who are afraid to leave childhood. It's something most of us can understand. Buck wasn't a character to loathe and despise; he was simply a guy who had trouble growing up, but luckily in the end, he starts to move towards that direction in life.Fine movie. Nothing quite like it!!"
4,Music,"Saw Chuck and Buck today, had to return it to my local Blockbuster Video. Very disturbing. I can't quite comment on the film, too fresh in my mind and far too 'out there'. And mind you, I watched Gummo and thought it was perfectly sane. I was just curious what was that song played throughout the movie? I had to return the movie so fast that I forgot to watch the music credits, and now I want that song. Alas. If you are reading this and could tell me, please email me at creindl@purdue.edu the name of the song so I can go out and get it. One more thing: Sexually disturbed innocence sets me askew."
2,This Movie is just WRONG,"I'd like to start with the upside to the movie, Lupe Ontiveros is brilliant as the art house theater owner who has a significant effect on the movie.But other than her, and several sparks in the film, this movie is just wrong. I'm not being moralistic. The movie just doesn't work. There is never one mention of the fundamental stalker rule: RESTRAINING ORDER! Nothing here makes for enjoyable filmmaking. You will leave this movie thinking about what you just watched, and wake up the next morning understanding why its so awful. Then you will feel violated for spending money on this film"
1,Chuck and Buck,"I'm not sure why people find this movie funny. Its not funny, its depressing. The entire movie is about one persons misery and how he tries to cope with suppressed childhood homosexuality. I was expecting a dark comedy, which its not."
1,not my interest,"got this recommendation from a list of the best movies you've never seen (entertainment weekly). i bit because a few that i had seen were listed. big mistake. this one and about three others i tried were big fails. can't figure out why my likes made the list. this movie was a total creepshow about an arrested dev loner living with his mom, who becomes obsessed with a former classmate when he turns up to the funeral of creepy lonely guy's mom. the rest is a twisted mess that lands me with gay movie recommendations from amazon. well, i think i'm past that now between my british period pieces and wallace and grommit choices."
2,Too thin for a feature,"Chuck and Buck is another underwhelming shot-on-video indie that isn't nearly as good as it thinks it is or needs to be to justify its feature length. The biggest problem is Mike White's character, an infantile gay stalker obsessed with the childhood friend who has moved on in the world. The premise is workable, but White's own script never develops him beyond a single defining note, which makes for an increasingly unbelievable lead easily outshone by the supporting players - not so much Chris Weitz as the object of his obsession but definitely by Paul Weitz as a spectacularly bad lookalike actor Chuck casts in a frightening autobiographical play and Lupe Ontiveros as the show's down to earth director. It does pick up as it goes along and it's not unwatchable, it's just one of those films that really offers too few reasons to see it."
1,"Awful, awful, awful","Every director has one movie that they want to make, but shouldn't. For Miguel Arteta, that movie was the extremely unfortunate Chuck & Buck. Never mind that the transfer from the harsh original digital video presentation is of usual substandard Artisan quality- the reason for Chuck's character's psychoses is never examined....the characters are therefore left as standard stereotypes that are as deep as a mud puddle. Plotwise, it meanders and never comes to any kind of rational conclusion. The acting is tedious & drab, which is exceptionally depressing given Mike White's talent.The most appalling aspect of this movie? The overall lesson learned is that if you stalk a person long and hard enough, regardless of how often they tell you to leave them alone, you will finally win them over. Oh, well done."
2,I'm still waiting to start laughing,"I'm glad I didn't have to pay money to rent this movie! I don't see how this movie was ""entertaining"" in the sense. I pitied Chuck's fiancee and how she was portrayed as ""evil"" by Buck because she was getting married to Chuck. The whole ""women are evil, don't marry/date them because they'll break us apart"" thing is beginning to get quite old and played out.I don't find the humor in making fun of sheltered people with psychological problems. Mental illness is nothing to make fun of. I also don't see the humor in making fun of suppressed homosexual feelings."
1,The most painful experience of my life,"Watching Chuck and Buck was, without a doubt, the most painful experience of my life. Walking on a broken leg in the forrests of southeast Asia for two weeks was certainly more enjoyable than this movie! Everyone involved in the making of this movie, from the writers, to the directors, and even actors, should feel a great sense of shame for unleashing this monsterous creation onto an unsuspecting public. I am surprised no one has notified the Hague in order to put the creators of this movie on trial for human rights violations. Whatever you do, do not see this movie, if you see it at the rental store, walk out immediately! If a friend invites you over to watch it, crawl into bed, assume the fetal position, and wait for further developments. This movie is more than bad, it is painful, it is psychologically scarring. it is two hours of you life you can never get back, and you will wish you could."
5,Chuck n Buck Know How to Muck and Ruck,"Great movie. Very different. It explores a side of childhood many have been through, but many do not talk about as adults. Chuck and Buck do! Very brave, funny, cutting edge, and real. If you are homophobic, skip it."
2,"For what it's worth, here's what I think","Cool flick. I liked the Paul Weitz ""bad actor"" character a lot, and for that alone I would check it out. It has some interesting turns, and you are caught off guard a couple of times. Original, quirky, and rough. If you like this kind of thing, rent it."
4,An Indie Film That Tests Your Patience,"This is one strange film and if you are an ""indie"" fan, you may like it. My point is that films should make you feel something and this one does more than that. Homosexuality is not the issue here. Child-like stalking and innocence beyond belief are the mainstay concerns. I did feel uncomfortable, empathic, uneasy, sorrowful, giddy and weird all over. This is a real-life movie and that's why people are so squirmish about it. The end will satisy anyone - creepy or normal to the hilt. It is a rare slice of life and sometimes we don't like being reminded that we have a mentally disabled relative."
3,Not A Comedy,"The box paints this movie as a comedy. It perhaps can be viewed that way, but it is really the tragedy of Buck obsessed with his childhood friend Chuck. He can't understand that Chuck on longer wants to play the sex games they had so much fun with as children.Buck is also like a moth to flame with a Chuck look-alike who also has no sexual interest in him. He is powerless to look elsewhere for love.The movie does not have a Hollywood ending, nothing particularly resolved, just like real life, with a little hope of better things to come.Buck has some minor mental problem. His directness gets him in repeated trouble. This is a weird movie the way it pulls at your heartstrings getting you to sympathsise with an idiot, who stands flawed, oddly symbolic of everyman."
1,"Not for me, thanks","Strong performances? Yes. Good cinema? Probably. Funny? Not.Very disturbing, very dark."
3,Tragicomedy?,"I have to agree this movie is not for everyone. So many times a movie is improperly labeled as a comedy or a drama, when in fact it happens to be a hybrid, a tragedy-comedy of sorts. This is the case of Cable Guy, Jack, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Raising Arizona, and so many others that escape my brain.This is a sad movie with a hopeful ending. There are two main morals to the story:*Be careful what you do in life, because sooner or later the chickens come home to roost *The corny ""behind each cloud there is a silver lining""Paul Weitz (the bad actor), Lupe Ontiveros (Beverly, the theater's house manager) and Paul White (Buck) all have stellar performances. The only complaint i have is that Buck sometimes comes up with statements that are incongruous for someone of his mental age."
2,chuck and YUCK!!!,"I personally found this movie to be horrifying.. the characters were poorly developed.. the situational comedy was not very well thought out. the dialogue was cramped and under creative.. and the acting was enought to make me want to brake my DVD player.. It's too bad i cant get back the 90 minutes i spent watching this film, and spend it doing something creative, like licking stamps or watching paint grow, they would be more entertaining..This movie was disturbing and bizarre at best.. and frightening to the core.. if you have ever been stalked and want to know what your stalker is feeling and going thru... watch chuck and buck.. then call the nearest asylum.."
1,This is entertainment?,"This movie, if you can call it that , is about the lamest thing I've ever seen---especially given the bait--""twisted and funny"" or some such sentiment which appears on the package.I saw this about 5 or 6 years ago, so my memory for all the details is shot; however, my friend and I both give it a zero ---for zero ideas, zero artistic integrity, zero effect...you get my point....This is the Emperor's New Clothes of the indie movie industry...SOMETHING'S supposed to be there, but sadly, it isn't."
5,"Mike White is brilliant,","He is also partly responsible for the best television series ever, an underapprecicated masterpiece called ""Freaks and Geeks"". It is now on, of all places Fox Family Channel on Tuesday evenings. If you watch it you will be treated to some of the same brilliance as this film. Shots that don't pull away, even when something embarassing is happening to someone you begin to care about. Characters so real, with flaws yet you still see their humanity and even strengths. Hilarious scenes that come out of mundane daily things and never a pat ending, even if you do perceive it to be happy. This movie is a must if you are tired of the stuff we're force fed and the series ""Freak and Geeks"" will piss you off that NBC was so evil for not giving it a proper shot, or maybe people like being force fed? By the way special mention to F & G's cast and the shows creators, if Chuck and Buck is any indication of what to expect then some of us will have an alternative. Thank You."
4,When we are miles apart.,"Kiri lives in a country many miles away from her grandmother. Her grandmother has never seen her, but sends Kiri letters and gifts on all sorts of occasions. Then Kiri's grandmother dies. Shortly after her grandmother's death, Kiri recieves one last gift from her. It is an old quilt that Kiri's grandmother made long ago. Kiri's parents mend and clean the quilt together and in doing so the mourn and remember and grow closer together as a family.This book is short and easy to read. It's a good text to use to help children who are struggling with reading. It has some nice illustrations. It also has a multicultural theme to it. A nice, short story."
5,Very Gooooood! Essential for Understanding Jonathan Edwards,This is totally indispensable book when searching Edward's Theology.Whoever is seeking to understand Jonathan Edwards as a whole must read and investigate it.I recommend you eagerly!
3,Shrink wrapped.,So in side of the packaging box was a shrink wrapped mat. I did not look used but it did look pretty cheeply packaged. The mat itself looks ok but leaves you to wonder if this was used or if it was new. Other than that its ok.
3,Good book for an 8th grader,"While I do feel that the information in this book is good, it is written so that your 14 year old will have no problem gliding through this book. This is by no means a college level book, although it does have some really nice pictures. I personally would have preferred more thorough information as opposed to large fonts with full page pictures."
2,JOHN WAYNE IN MINOR ROLE,"This is essentially a Tim McCoy film and a darn good one, too. The ""Duke"" has a minor, supporting role in it, due primarily to the fact that Columbia's Harry Cohn didn't like Wayne and was giving him bit parts. He later ""escaped"" to Mascot where he made three serials before landing the Western series at Warner's. And of course, the rest is history. The ""Duke"" also had a minor role in another McCoy film, ""Two Fisted Law,"" both released in l932."
3,Tim McCoy Stars,"In this B western, John Wayne costars-Tim McCoy stars. In the modern movie world, this film is watched to see John Waynes performance. This is one of Waynes early performances and the film is pleasent to watch-but no more than that."
2,For those untroubled by falsehoods,"Although most of the sensational ""mysteries"" and disappearances of ships and airplanes in the ""Bermuda Triangle"" have since been proven to be the result of either human error or ordinary bad weather, this is still an entertaining read. For a while. After running to the computer every few pages to check on recent developments in the searches for these crafts and finding out that either wreckage has been found, or that recordings of distress signals have been digitally enhanced and turned out to be far less ominous than reported, I got more and more disenchanted. That this book is frequently listed as non-fiction is unfortunate. Nevertheless, Berlitz is a compelling writer, and it's not difficult to read. I'm sure if you like this genre and aren't terribly distracted by ""facts"" you may enjoy this book."
2,totally preposterous but entertainng pseudo-scienceI,"If you believe in ghosts and fairies, this is the book for you. For me, it is immensely fascinating how seemingly rational persons go for this pseudo-scientific nonsense. I give it 2 stars, not zero, because it's entertaining in its own absurdity."
3,Other Books,"This is one of a bunch of books that Berlitz did in the 1970s, when it seemd there was a bit of a craze for all that Mysteries of the Unknown stuff.This is entertaining enough, and looking at the mystery of the disappearance of various vehicles in this area of the world, and the odd stories that have sprung up about it."
1,Completely worthless,"Charles Berlitz should stick with languages, as when he ventures into the world of the paranormal, he often appears to be winging it. His research is frequently superficial or even non-existent, as in this work. He often gets facts wrong, and favors outlandish explanations over more plausible ones. Don't take my word for it-- compare what he says about particular incidents with what you can find in reputable sources and you'll see what I mean. Instead of this book, I would recommend Lawrence Kusche's THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE MYSTERY-- SOLVED, or my own THE EVIDENCE FOR THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE. The only reason I give it 1 star is because there is no lower rating."
3,A sort of Romeo and Juliet of the West,"Henry de Spain is hired by the railroad to bring law and order to Sleepy Cat. (Yes, that's the name of the town. Don't look at me, I didn't come up with it.) His main trouble is from the powerful Morgan clan, long a law unto themselves. Naturally, amongst all those law-breakers and trouble-makers is one lone, innocent lass named Nan Morgan. And naturally, she and Henry fall in love. They have to keep their relationship a secret as her villainous first cousin, Gale, wants to get rid of Henry and marry Nan himself. There's also the added problem that Nan's family may have been involved with the earlier murder of Henry's father. Will these two love birds be able to overcome the bloody past and start a fresh new chapter in Sleepy Cat? This is 1916, of course they will."
5,A great book about money for ages 7 to 107.,"A great book about money. A must if you are interested in stocks, bonds, credit, ATMs, mutual funds, the history of money or money in general. For ages 7-107, making it great for school, while humorous cartoons make it fun to read. Ideas for thought, and projects for the family. Crisp, clear writing makes it easy to understand, whle Word Banks is mini glossary. Makes a great gift!"
3,Younger Kids money book,"This book a little dumb but still cut. All parents out there who have 6 year olds who can read and like counting should buy this book. I like one page that shows how credit cards become money but that is pretty much it. The illustrater, Randy Verougstraete was decent but I guess it is hard to illistrate a money bookOn a nicer note this is a really cute book for younger kids. My little sister loved it. It is really a matter of taste. This book had a lot of cool facts such as how tall is ten thousand dollars worth of nickles. A cute book but this book is better for 5 or 6 year olds not older."
1,Worthless - buy a Carlon/Dimango instead,"After spending an hour trying to set this up in my parents' home, I discovered in tiny, tiny print inside the instruction sheet ""doorbell must ring for 2 seconds"" for this product to work. Of course, there was no such disclaimer on the OUTSIDE of the package. If you have a doorbell sound that is flatter and less ringing, this will not work, no matter how you locate or adjust the transmitter. I could actually say Dinggggggdonggggggg and it would work--just not with the actual doorbell! This is a $30 donation to Heath/Zenith. I have a Dimango extender in my own home which took 10 minutes to install, works every time, and works with any kind of doorbell except electronic ones that play tunes. Get that instead and save yourself a lot of aggravation!"
1,Zenith Door Chime Extender,"I thought this would be a perfect solution for hearing my front door bell from my basement. It only works approximately 10% of the time. Even after many adjustments, it does not work as portrayed."
2,Chime Self Destructed Not Once But Twice,"The first plug-in doorbell chime lasted 2 years and 4 months. The extension transmitter is still working.So, off to Home Depot I went where the original kit was purchased from. Since they didn't have just the wireless accessory chime, I had to look for the least expensive wireless door chime kit which turned out to be the SL-6166-C which came with the push button transmitter. Only the plug-in doorbell chime was needed. That chime lasted a couple of hours before I smelled something burning. The unit self destructed while plugged into the wall outlet. I returned the piece of junk and got a refund.So, off to Rona I went. There I was able to find just the replacement wireless accessory chime. It was model #SL-6143-A and didn't have the volume adjustment knob on the back. It was only a 2-note chime which was fine with me. So far, it's $10 cheaper than model #SL-6166-C and it is still working."
1,Bad Bell product,"I tried 3 of these chime extenders - thinking the first two were defective. Howenver, is simply poor product design. The Microphone - even when placed directly on the chime - sometimes does not function (with the sensitivity at maximum). When the microphone (transmitter) does work, the Chime (receiver) has to be close to the transmitter, otherwise it does not chime consistently. A very aggravating product experience that wasted a lot of my time. Look for a better product."
4,We can hear the Bell.,"I had a little difficulty finding a place in the house where the receiver could ""see"" the transmitter. Also, the microphone sensitivity had to be increased to ""hear"" the existing door bell properly. Once all that was worked out after a bit of trial and error, the unit has been working just fine."
3,Works but have to be next to sound source.,"Works but have to be next to sound source, an inch away from doorbell or buzzer. I positioned the microphone part right next to my apartment buzzer before it works, 2 inch away it wouldn't work even at highest sensitivity."
2,"Microphone not consistent, then failed","This doorbell extender works by placing a small microphone near your doorbell. The microphone listens for any loud sound within a certain pitch range, and then triggers the remove units, (which plug into outlets.) While the remote units were loud and worked great, the microphone on the main unit was very touchy. A loud yawn would be enough to set it off, but many time the sound of the doorbell ringing would not.After about a year of ownership, the chimes started getting set off for no reason at all, and about a week later the microphone stopped working all together. I'm now stuck shopping for not only a new doorbell extender, but I need new satalite units as well, meaning that this will code me at least $40 to replace."
1,Died after 10 days.,"First Heath Zenith unit just couldn't be heard, even with volume all the way up. Second unit worked for about 10 days then died. Presumably the transmitter, since its light didn't come on anymore."
1,Poor Design Sends Frequent False Signals,"I must say that I have to agree with all of the bad reviews for this product. There are two main issues I have with this wireless chime. One, the microphone's sensitivity is poor. Like most reviewers here, I had to place it right next to the door chime, and I had to turn the sensivity setting all the way up for it to work. And two, the unit rings falsely all times of the day, tho' it seems to be most annoying at 3 in the morning. Many times I've had to get up and remove the receiver from the power outlet to get it to stop. The manual says the unit may send out false signals due to loud noises - not so; at 3 am, it's quiet as a church-mouse in my house! Unfortunately, I bought this at Home Depot without doing online research. My conclusion - don't buy this product; do your research and spend a few dollars more for a better quality product."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed at the fact that several cross references that I happened to find are missing or incomplete. Mistakes of this kind are easy to correct and the authors should have done so before it was published. It was good to see the chemical structures of some constituents of Chinese Medicines being available in the book. However,judging from the title of the book, one would normally expect to see a similar amount of pages are dedicated to the medicinal applications of the medicines. Sadly, this is not the case in this book. Too brief and rough is the word for this part. It, therefore, seems to me that the book promises lots, yet delivers a little and is overpriced."
2,Disappointing,"The authors ought to provide an index that relates the source herbs and the chemical compounds, so readers can know the active ingredients of each herb. Missing this most important index, I find the book almost useless.On the other hand, the 3 indexes of names seem redundant.All in all, the book seems under-prepared yet overpriced."
5,Beautiful earrings!!!,These earrings are smaller than the pendant which I think looks much better than having the pendant and earrings the same size. They are very sparkly - moreso than the picture and very solid. I also bought the necklace that goes with it and the pendant is absolutely beautiful but the chain I'm not super into so I'm using a white gold 16 inch chain I have. The one it came with is very strong and obviously very good quality but a little to thick for my taste. Beautiful jewelry and makes me feel and look like a princess!!! Thanks Amazon!
4,One of the best Indie artist I've herad in a while!,I love this CD. The brush of Olga's voice along with the colors of her lyrics make me want to hear it over and over again.I have heard her live and she is awesome. I can't wait to hear her next CD recording because I have heard the new songs live and they are incredible. Can't wait!
5,Refreshing,"I found ""Stop Paddling/Start Sailing"" a thoroughly enjoyable read. Roger conveys very useful information on the treatment of mental illness without ever slipping into woe or grief over the challenges he has faced. I was left with an optimistic and refreshing new view of life with Manic Depression.JD Stottlemire, author,""You Me and Apollo: Hope Beyond Bipolar Disorder"""
5,Heroes with a difference.....,"First I was not expecting much but this show did deliver on all fronts.True power and great assembly of cast, well structured main plots and side plots. Awesome story telling, some great guest surprising actors (Christopher Eccleson etc)However both in imagination and scale, combined with all out talent & even if you loath it. The intelligence & spirit of this show is beyond any other embodied most in Peters character yet present in leaps and bounds in all the others.It makes you think, it gave some true iconic depth & appeal the imagery in the pilot alone shows how far reaching one little show can be. Worth every penny & cannot wait till season 2 finely gets all the way to Scotland.Great viewing & hope when season 2 arrives that it is half as good as this by the way - Homecoming was an epic among some other great stand alone episodes.More please!"
5,Fabulous,This is my favorite TV show. This is definitely excellent viewing. I can't say enough wonderful things about this show.The DVD came very quickly and in great condition.
5,Heroes Season 1 DVD,I'd never watched it before on tv but I'd heard how great the show was so I decided to buy the DVD set. At first it was a little slow but it gets very good after the first few episodes. I highly recommend it!
5,Get the DVDs: Watch the deleted sceenes,"Best show since Babylon 5. Catch up on season one before season two begins - and don't forget to watch the deleted sceenes. Trading cards coming out with signatures, 1 of a kind art sketches, and show memorabilia??? (not sure what that is but it sounds interesting)."
2,heros,Series started out pretty interesting then got stranger and more convoluted as it went along. Ascribed a lot to an evolutionary/destiny connection which in the real world is an oxymoron. Sure it's Si-Fi but constantly changing paradigms does not add to complexity but just eliminates the need for it. I will not spend any money or time watching the next season.popsos
1,"Fun series, terrible DVD manufacturing","I did enjoy the Heroes series, but the reason I am giving this set only one star is because of the terrible quality control. I received this set for my birthday, and was pleased until I noticed that the layers of one of the DVDs were coming apart on the inside. Returned the set to Amazon and got a new one - this time with two defective discs. Returned for a refund.Since then I have found that NBC Universal DVD sets are well-known for this shoddy quality, especially when bearing the ""Made in Mexico"" stamp on the cellophane. (Google it - collectors of DVD sets for old TV shows seem especially aware of this.) Apparently one or more of their Mexican facilities are not being maintained properly. This set wasn't worth the $20 my gift-giver paid, and it's definitely not worth the $45 Amazon is charging now. Be warned."
3,starts out good but goes downhill,Started out so well. but in the end it was just a x-men movie. the personal stories did add a bit but the ending was a dissapointment
3,Not sure yet,"One of the DVD cases was crunched and I don't know yet if the DVD itself was affected as I haven't had time to play it. I will contact Amazon if there is a problem with the DVD. Other than that, everything was fine; price was OK and delivery was fairly quick."
5,Heroes in HD DVD is going to be Awesome!,I can't beleive it is finally going to happen...HD DVD gets Heroes! My husband loves this series. This will be a must buy! Thank You HD DVD!!!
4,Heroes Season 1,What can I say it is the best thing to hit television since Smallville.We need more Heroes!!!
5,Good packaging,The wide screen presentation is well done on the DVD version. Shame they don't have a Blu-Ray version out.
4,Season One Of Heroes,Initially this particular product was for my father as a birthday present. He was so excited to get it and at first I didn't really get it. Then I sat down with him one day and watched it. I found out that I really enjoyed it. There are only a few good shows left. This would be one if them. A mixture of superheroes meets society its really interesting I must say. This is a must have!
4,A great first season,"I watched the pilot a few weeks ago and was instantly hooked. The characters are all very different but likable, the acting is great, the stories are interesting, and the powers are cool to see while they're developing--there's more than just flying and super-strength. This show sort of has everything, in a way: action, romance, sci-fi, family relationships, corruption, mysterious characters with dubious morals... The one things I noticed, though, was a distinct lack of fun. It's all drama and angst, especially for Nikki and Peter. Hiro and Ando make up for a lot of it, but it's still very much present.Regardless, Heroes is definitely recommended, and not just for fans of these superhero-y type things. Buy this DVD and prepare to spend an entire day watching--with bathroom breaks, of course."
4,Borrowed and Delighted,"I borrowed this from a friend of the family and what a pleasant surprise! I have pretty much given up on anything being truly entertaining on network television but Heroes is a delightful bit of escapist fun. For those ""geeks"" out there, the allusions are well timed, amusing, and just obscure enough that most viewers won't get it. The casting is brilliant and, again, a few nods of inside jokes there as well. Yes, there is a derivative quality to some of it a la X-Men and Highlander but who cares when it is so very well done? Usually I can anticipate plot turns and developments. This show left me very pleasantly surprised and wrapped up so many plot threads that I was sure the final dvd would leave them all dangling. I look forward to borrowing season 2 when it is made available on dvd! (Also, if there isn't already a soundtrack compilation of the music used in the show there should be.)"
4,So worth it!,"The HD-DVD version of Heroes is absolutely amazing. With the prices of HD-DVD players dropping, it's a no-brainer to pick up this DVD set."
1,Horrible Quality Control,"So Far I have enjoyed the actual series, Which I ordered pre-release. BUT the DVDs are so poorly recorded that they are essentially unwatchable on my DVD player and TV. Finally resorted to using the DVD-ROM player on my computer, and even that has had terrible problems, Lots of artifacting, hangups and outright crashes, I have seen bootleg copies of movies that were better made."
1,Bad,I ordered this almost a month ago and I still haven't recieved it and I have tried to communicate with the seller and they haven't answered me.
1,Heroes Season One,I wish I could give an opinion but since I never received the item I can't. I am waiting for the credit on my account which you said I would receive in about 2 weeks. I would have been happy just to receive the DVD.Laura Garwood
2,What an exercise in endurance!,"I fortunately ignored the Heroes hype during the initial run but I found myself sitting through the marathon with someone and I thought I was going to bleed from my fat belly. It was THAT painful staying in my seat to sit through this thing. It's expensive, it's empty and there's no chemistry amongst the actors except when Hayden Panettiere is on screen. It's just so boringk. Oh, let me out of chere."
4,Engaging escapism,"Quite disconnected from reality; however, engaging in a strange, escapist way. I've only been through two episodes but do look forward to the unfolding of the story. ""Bet you can't eat just one"" seems to apply. Not high art, nor great television -- we've seen better, much much better. But we're scraping the bottom of the barrel these days and this fits the bill for our age. I'm stunned and a bit dismayed that people would give it 5 stars, must be a generational thing."
4,Loved Season One except for...,I'll have to admit I have a love/hate relationship with Season 1. I was a late-comer to the show. I started watching around episode 5 and fell in love with it. I began watching it because of the hype and a friend of mine was really into it. I dropped a star rating because I felt cheated with the finale and the 3 episodes leading up to it. All that build-up for what?...a mediocre season finale.I do have high hopes for Season 2. Will I buy season 1 on DVD? Probably so but I'm still debating it.
3,"Hollywood doing what it does best, in a mediocre way","In the last years Hollywood has pulled an artistic scam creating TV series with largely unconnected storylines, with obscure plots that promise to be unveiled only after watching an entire season. In a theater, at least you have the option of walking out. Here, you dislike some of the characters, but hang in there to see what happens with the others you like.For a writer (and I am a professional writer/editor) it's a scam. A shell game. Just keep switching everything around, and make audience hints that take years to explain. If it happens that some random combination of writer/director/actor works ... play it up ... as if you knew it would happen all along. Minimize the others, milk scandal sheets for ""what really happened"".Artistic deception and boredom, covered by a few genuinely interesting characters. Something for everyone. Except artistic integrity."
4,All right,Nothing to comment. Only the shipment was some late.But the final product is OK. Advisable
4,Blow or go!,"Starts off real well, but gets a bit monotonous as the season progresses... But still much better than the annoyingly erratic Lost series.Better off watching Jericho."
5,amazingly realistic,performances by the actors are amazingly realistic. the stories are believable and accurate. suspense galore and at the end of every episode makes you want to see the next one
5,"If you get this, make time to watch this...",...because you can very well be going to bed in the wee hours of the morning wanting to see what happens next!Highly addictive! This show is to me what my mother's soaps are to her LOL! It's been awhile since I was into a show like this. I don't want to say anything more or else spoil it.
5,Couldn't wait,Had to buy this series on Region1. Couldn't wait for the BBC1 to finish the series.can't wait for series 2!!
1,Heroes HD DVD extremely disappointing,"Ordered the HD DVD in very good faith, have used amazon before and have always received excellent service - this time not the case.DVD did not work, sent back received second copy this also didn't work. Had a great deal of trouble trying to receive a refund on the item due to inconsistent feedback from customer service advisors who didn't appear to be aware of their own company's policies.Shocking service and will not be ordering from amazon again."
1,"Excellent show, but why 7 Discs?","So why are there 7 discs? I thought HD DVD and Blu-ray offered so much more content capcity than that of standard DVDs?!? Like I've said before; Just another tactic used by the studios to raise the MSRP (""Ooh, but it's a 7-disc set, so it must be worth $100!""). Gimme a break! Not only is HD DVD competing with Blu-ray (the better of the two), but unless BOTH formats start offering content at a more attractive price-point, the new high-definition media is going to fall right on it's face. Save yourself some cash and buy the standard DVD set or better yet, download the episodes from iTunes ($1.99 x 23 = $45.77, Wow! You save $50.00!). The only thing you'll be missing is a few lines of resolution and a flimsy cardboard box."
3,WHATS ON THE DISCS????,"I realize the show is good already and I'll probably buy it. However, what extras are included? When I buy compilation disks, I want it packed with exclusives, commentaries, extras and the BIZNESS. whats on these ones?"
1,Could have been better,"Heroes is entertaining and does hold your attention at times. It is not very original and I am sad to say,it will make any attempt by J. Michael Straczynski of ""Babylon 5"" fame to bring ""Rising Stars"" to the screen and be compared as a knockoff.""American Idol"" and ""Lost"" are considered giant hits, followed by millions, explains the massive appeal of this show.The show bounces around constantly giving each type of viewer something to identify with and most waiting expectantly to see what happens in the next episode. The finale was a weak attempt to bring a conclusion to this season, and may be an indication of how weak this series will be in the long run as the writers run out of ideas and try to copy other successful cliche' that will be touted as original ideas.I will probably buy this for the extras. When the price drops to around $10.00 or I find a quality bootleg copy."
1,"Best, best, worst. Where are spanish subtitles?","1) Best TV show2) Best high definition format3) The worst options, this high definition title seems to not include spanish subtitles.Standard DVD version of season one comes with spanish subtitles so why HD-DVD do not?What is happening with Universal guys? I and many HD-DVD fans are not going to buy it without spanish subtitles."
4,What a surprise,"I watched one episode when it first premiered and then let it fall by the way side for some reason. Then I started hearing all the hype but because the show is serialized couldn't really pick it up in the middle.When the DVD came out I of course picked it up and my Boyfriend, who for some reason thought it was going to be a WB type thing, watched it all in 9 days.Great show with some wonderful characters. Exciting but with well written dialogue and interesting characers (good and bad).I urge to go pick this DVD up and....Save the Cheerleader, save the World!"
2,Great show from the start but not worth buying,"I was hooked on this show and the first two seasons were really good. But then the writers went on strike and this show went to trash. It just started to get retarded and boring. The Ending was Stupid and lame. Wish I never started to watch this show as it became a waste of time. I wouldnt even buy the seasons which I Didnt. They have all four seasons in Insant viewing on netflix. Which is where I watched it. If you consider watching it, watch it there and dont wast your money buying this. Just My Opinion."
4,Heroes vs X-Men,"I am a huge X-men fan. So how does this stack up? I think it brings a sense of realism to the comic book idealism.Nathan is Heroes version of Professor Xavier, but he is young and just learning his limits, or lack thereof. Claire, the Cheerleader, is Wolverine without the claws. I could go on, but the point is this, if you like X-men you'll love this. It is definitely for an older crowd, though; there is lots of violence that doesn't even stop with death.I hold back the fifth star only because I believe the level of gore was unnecessarily high."
4,Warning truely region locked,"Warning for non-US buyers, this DVDset is indeed locked for de US region. (in most cases they are not even if Amazon say the are). It will not play on a regionlocked DVD player.Series are fine, have watched it with much pleasure."
2,"Why call them ""Heros""?","I am a huge fan of this kind of show, I loved several of the characters and so stuck it out for 2 and a 1/2 episodes. After that I started feeling like I was doing something bad just watching it.They are supposed to be Heros! So why are they sleeping with married men, cheating on their boyfriends, taking drugs, and possibly killing in revenge ?(I didn't watch far enough to see if the cheerleader really killed off the fellow who tried to rape her.) Cheating is implied to be OK, heroin has its uses, and it's OK and kinda cool to watch videos of stripping women. I had to keep jumping up and blocking the screen with my body whenever my kids passed through the room as I watched this DVD. I don't watch much recent TV so this may be par for the course but it boggles my mind that no one else seems to have found this a tad immoral."
1,Never Received,"Although Season 2 & 3 arrived, Season 1 never got to me. On inquiring I received and email with lots of links and instructions 2 go see my post office. Its a $20 something order!! and I earn $1.50 per minute. Go figure."
2,Not actually a story,"A friend recommended the series to me highly, and so I purchased it. I was disappointed. I thought that the episodes would combine into a long story with a beginning, middle, and end. Despite the themes of time travel and prophecy, there is very little coherent overall story arc. So many loose ends are remaining, it is hard to recall the authors tying off any at all. The heavily-built-up final showdown was neither clever nor satisfying.As a tv series, it may make the producers a lot of money."
4,Heroes Season 1 Review,"Hadn't seen any Heroes episodes, but thought it was great. Can't wait for season 2."
5,"Heroes, Season 1","Heroes is the best series on TV. Excellent characters who fit their roles well. Intriguing, captivating and thrilling! A must to own and watch."
5,Heroes DVD -Shipped to UK,"Brilliant product and received quickly, however, got stung for an extra 4 in vat and royalmail handling fee of 8 - 12 in total"
5,Best TV series since Lost 1st series,"Gosh! I couldn't stop watching this tv show. It certainly has been the best thing since Lost (the 1st season). Heroes is a new concept of x-men, people with powers. Once you watch one you can't stop. When I watched the last episode, it ended that chapter rather than most TV series will keep you hanging on until the next season. This one didn't and it was refreshing. Anyone can get into this program, it can be watched at Christmas with the family. It will keep you all gripped to your seats and no-one will want to leave the house until you have completed the boxset!."
4,Good,This show is very very dramatic and very very interesting. better then most shows. Great cast their winners. I miss it.
4,"Highly Entertaining, and Visually Stunning!","The show can occasionally be overly dramatic and unnecessarily violent. Fortunately, the show also has a distinct sense of humor that counter-balances some of the heavy-handedness.I can see how some viewers may find Hiro and Ando annoying, but to me they were fun. Though the show does meander, the writers do a commendable job staying consistent in terms of tone and continuity. There are numerous beats in early episodes that pay off late in the season. And the entire season works well as a complete story with each character following a distinct arc.The show really hits its stride after the ""Homecoming"" episode, which essentially marks the midpoint of the season. Standout episodes include ""Six Months Ago"", ""Company Man"", and ""Five Years Gone"". It bears mentioning that the story of Heroes owes *a lot* to The X-Men and Watchmen, however, it manages to establish its own identity with its distinct style."
5,one of the best shows on television,Only two words can describe Heroes AWE-Some. This hot new nbc drama follows the lives of seemingly ordinary people who discover they have extrodinary abilites. Everything in this show seemingly blends together to form a masterpiece of a show filled with delicious plot twists great acting a riveting storyline and characters that were truly meant to be put on tv. I'm not gonna spoil anything for you buy Heroes trust me you'll love it if not you need a doctor . To sum it all up Heroes is one of the best shows of the year which fails to dissapoint .
2,Didn't made me a fan of this genre,"Having not seen the TV show, I went and bought the whole first season. I must say, it's not meant to be watched continuously, but I did (my mistake). Imagine watching a 16.5-hour movie where the storyline/s are consolidating into a one non-progressing plot with characters that change but do not grow. The only suspense that kept me rooted to the screen was the question of ""who's Sylar's next protagonist-victim?"" The psychology of the evil Mother-influence was plumbed out (Sylar's, Nathan's, etc). I wept when they killed the old Hiro, I was hoping that they do the young one. The narration's too cryptic and tiring. If you haven't watched the TV series, watch the compilation in installments. Caveat emptor: it's a 16.5-hour movie that begs you to watch an another 16.5-hour sequel. And, oh yes, the bad guy's still alive."
3,Okay I guess,"I rented the first season instead of buying, thank God for that, don't get me wrong Heroes fans, the show is okay, but it's kind of boring, it's no where near Lost or Prison Break where you want more and more. I guess this show it's not for everyone."
1,Heros the first season,Recieved the DVDs in a prompt time. BUT the DVDs will NOT work in my new DVD. Other DVDs checked at same time did work. Thus leads me too believe the Hero DVDs are defective.
2,Read the book instead,"""Heroes"" is fresh and original only if you haven't read Alan Moore's comic book masterpiece,Watchmen, or seen the original Outer Limits episode that inspired it (""The Architects of Fear""). And then they didn't even have the guts to go through with it, opting for a cop-out ""love conquers all"" ending that made the finale feel incredibly rushed and tacked-on."
2,Not worth all of the hype or any of your money.,"If you haven't seen the series, don't buy this expecting great writing or acting. About the only ""great"" thing with this show is the marketing.I watched the entire season (albeit rather painfully) and usually love these types of shows. I kept expecting something to happen and I kept getting dissapointed.The acting was/is fair at best and the writing really failed to live up to even a small portion of the hype. I was dissapointed because I liked the pilot a lot and had high hopes for the show.In the end, it's mildly worth watching, but I am very surprised that the show didn't get canceled after this first season. I guess that's a testament to the marketing behind it."
1,"disgusting, gross, immoral. should have r rating",I bought this because I was heard good things about the show. I barely got through disc one as it was so grossand disgusting. From the opening scene of a professor calling God a cock roach to pornography then horrific scenes of rip and slash murder. That was enough for me. Going in the garbage! A good idea if they would have turned off the heads being blown off etc..Should have a rated R warning on the box!
1,false advertising,"I am an American citizen living on a military installation...so I order downloads of a great series and pay for it, so that I won't illegally obtain copies...and then I get ready to download and I am informed that I can't because I live outside the US. What a crock! Nice service for only people who do not serve their country outside the US borders.Sometimes I'm very disappointed with Amazon."
3,Fast shipment but not the item wasdnt quite as described,Very fast and professional shipping of the item. I thougth I bougth a all sones DVD (that was the descriptions says)but the DVD got sone 2 restrictions.But all in all very good product!
5,Witness the Next Generation,"This show was not suppose to be a hit, lol. The original pilot was supposedly so convoluted and downright annoying that the network made the producers basically change everything about it, and the only reason the show was greenlite was because NBC ran out of Drama pilots. But somehow, the new pilot was downright amazing, and a new hit television show was born.This DVD box set includes all 23 season-one episodes on 7 discs along with several behind-the-scenes featurettes, mini-documentaries, 50 deleted scenes, select episode commentaries, the original pilot (w/ commentary), and a character map."
4,I enjoy this series,"I am happy to own this series that I have enjoyed watching from the start and what shows I missed I watched on nbc site, this was great and I enjoy the comic book novel series online as well. I think this is a great purchase if you have enjoyed the show as I have."
5,Excellent show!,"I'm only 9 episodes in, but this show is very addicting (never saw an episode until I bought the HD-DVD set on recommendation).The HD-DVD set is of high quality both in terms of video/audio and also for the extras (lots of deleted scenes, etc.).Highly recommended to fans of comic-book style shows; probably the best TV series to capture the comic-book style."
3,"Heroes, Volume i","I went into this series hoping for a continuation of the excitement of the first episode, only to find that it was exactly that - a continuation of the first episode. Sagging plot line made this just an okay experience for me."
5,Innovative Television,"When I first saw Heroes, I knew that it would be a good series. It tapped into the powers of the heroes as well as the weaknesses. I always thought it was brilliant how the writers only let the viewer realize the villians deep into the season. I will get season 3 of heroes and maybe season 4, however the downside was the last season. I could not follow it, and that is the hallmark that the writers and producers have run out of good story lines. For at least 3 seasons heroes kept my attention and wondering whats next"
2,"Some excellent characters, but too many cliff-hangers","I didn't watch all the episodes in this first season of Heroes, primarily because of the lack of resolution in the plot lines. I prefer shows like Closer, Bones, Firefly, or Dexter, where each episode solves a situation or closes a case, and the continuing plot lines have to do with the character's relationships and personal situations. Heroes does have some charming and intriguing characters (Hiro and Ando, Suresh, Matt the policeman, the cheerleader's father, the politician's brother), but on the whole, I felt like the writers/producers were teasing us, jerking us around like puppets for the sake of inducing an emotional reaction, rather than simply telling us good stories about exceptional people."
3,Not a bad episode,"I thought this episode was pretty good, not great. Not a lot happened, but they started some new storylines that should be interesting.To weigh in on the ipod thing--Apple designed Ipods so that you can only play downloaded content from Itunes on them. This is how they make their money. Duh. How can you have an Ipod (or any music/video player) and not know this? The coding that would allow other providers (like Amazon Unbox) to provide content playable on Ipods is a deep, dark SECRET. Complain to Apple, they're the ones who are limiting you, not Amazon."
4,Totally awesome but flawed,"I just watched the whole first season for the first time after receiving these. The characters are so cool and real. You can really feel for them, even though they're completely strange and odd. There's a real subtext about the things we've been facing as Americans for the past eight years in here. About terrorism and distrustful government officials and people working behind the scenes of our lives and even a sort of 9/11 catastrophe of greater proportions looming in the foreground of the plot. But the writers or director or both were a bit lazy because there are lots of illogical flaws in the series as well, and sometimes it feels as if they figured their viewers wouldn't be smart enough to see those flaws, and that occasionally made me a little perturbed. Still, though, overall a great series. Would like to see the writing more careful, but otherwise, a really watchable series."
5,Heroes - Season 1 [HD DVD],"Fantastic set. A must-have for fans of the show or for anyone who enjoys solid, riveting story-telling and plot development. Looks even better here than it did initially when broadcast terestrially in high-def. The TV show is very well done; I think it shows very well how real people, in the real world, might react if they suddenly were gifted/cursed with paranormal ""super-powers"" I give the show 9/10 and the HD-DVD set 10/10 for technical excellence."
2,Looks Great but Doesn't Add Up,"Many folks agree that Heroes started going downhill in the 2nd Season but I would argue that there wasn't much there to begin with. The premise is wonderful (and not all that different from its better predecessor The 4400). But there are some terrible storylines written about African American characters and beautiful women by writers who have NO IDEA what they are like in real life. Everyone, for this reason is quite shallow and without any real depth, much like a layman's impression of a comic book character. The whole Jessica, DL and kid story is so bad, I long to throw things at the TV when they are on screen. Peter Petrelli's acting is pretty bad making him a sorry lead character. I like Hiro and Peter's brother a bit but not all episodes can be about them, can they? I would prefer a DVD set with all Hiro episodes."
5,Awesome!!!,I recently got hooked on Hereos. I wanted to watch the whole thing start to finish. It is going to be torture to watch the 2nd season week by week.
5,Fantastic,Just finished watching season 1 and was at the edge of the seat throughout. One of the most amazing series that I have seen in a long time. Cant wait for season-2 to come out.Hiro Nakamura and the rest of the cast rocks!!!
5,Heroes Season 1,"My fiance is a Heroes freak. I shopped around because the prices varied a bit. Amazon had the best price and it was shipped immediately. Needless to say, my fiance loved the gift and once again I was more than satisfied with Amazon's prompt service and great prices!"
4,Hero's The first season,"Was not worth $39.00 for the First Season set of DVD's, even with the unshown pilot episode, and the extras such as deleted scenes, commentary's."
3,Great picture and Sound,I could not find anything bad to say about the picture and sound quality of this TV series on HD DVD. The only issue I have is the number of discs (7) and the type of packaging such a number requires. I found removing and replacing discs to be quite awkward.Hopefully this series will eventually come out on blu-ray on fewer disks and simpler packaging.
3,Great Box Set,"Box Set was great, too bad it took 4 days when i selected overnight delivery, complete waste of money in that respect"
2,"Great Product, but terrible presentation!","This is only a review for the HDDD edition and presentation.It doesn't have any other audio language than english! and it only have subtitles in English and french! How they dare to realease and edition like this and not inmfor people is beyond me. If you live outside the Us, don't buy this! I wasted $100 Dollars!"
1,Lousy disks,I tried two of these and both had defective disks 4 and 6. The other 5 disks worked fine on my XBOX360 HD-DVD drive. I had to return both and buy the plain DVDs.
2,Don't waste your time.,"I was all about this show. I was head over heals in love with it. That is up until the last 4 episodes! Where they proceeded to cheat me and every other viewer out of a good ending to the season. It's like the writers woke up one day and just decided they had better stuff to do. Everything leading up to the last 4 episodes is simply amazing. But after putting in the time for 20 episodes, I expected the same creativity and ""wow-ness"" in the ending. It was a let down.I won't be watching Heroes next season!"
5,A Classic,"Murray's work on Romans may not match the pastoral brilliance of John Stott, or be as up to date in scholarship as Douglas Moo (which replaced this volume in the wonderful NICNT series), but it is a must have. There have been hundreds of commentaries written on Romans over the past few centuries, but Murray's has joined the small cluster at the top of the 'classics' list (with Charles Hodge and Martin Luther, and the less orthodox Barth). All future commentaries will continue to reference Murray, as the standout work of its kind for the mid-20th century.In addition to its usefulness for preachers and seminary students, it is also a nice window into the kind of teaching that was coming out of Westminster Seminary in a golden period of productivity when that school was THE leading Reformed school of the English speaking world."
4,A Helpful Book,"I read the appropriate chapter before each port of call. The author gives you hints on problems you may face as well as encouraging you to see the important sights. I felt that with his guidance we didn't miss anything, and enjoyed the vacation spots much more."
4,Travel book was helpful,"This book was helpful to us in planning and taking our cruise to the Mexican Riviera along the Pacific Coast. I liked everything about it, except I wish that the maps of each of the cruise stops were more complete, and showed better each of the items discussed in the text. I found a few errors, but on the whole it was a very helpful book."
4,"Very Good, But.......",Generally found to be a very good book in regards to our trip but was in error on some specifics in our three ports; i.e. by walking left (per the author's instructions) we went in the wrong direction. Double check before you go but this book is a great reference.
5,The Best!,"On first listening these overtures struck me with their brilliant phrasing and musical energy. I purchased a 3CD set of Rossini by Marriner and the Academy, and though they contain the wit and uptempo requirements, the share abandon and enthusiasm is sorely lacking - in these Gamba recordings they are entirely present!You may wish to sample other William Tell Overtures, in fact I would recommend it since the music is sprawling in nature and many different insights are just as rewarding (Karajan, Beecham...). But for the rest I can't imagine anyone doing these pieces better.One of the best buys of often recorded music that I've had the pleasure of taking a chance on."
2,Suprisingly disappointing.,"Kids Like Us just didnt do it for me on their new album. Their debut cd kicked a$$. The first sounded so much like Sum 41's critically acclaimed album, 'All Killer No Filler'. The reason I got into Kids Like Us is due to the fact that my favorite band is Sum 41. KLU captured the energy, agressivenes and absolute genius of the Sum 41 sound. This album tends to lean more towards the sound of bands like Trapt and 3 Days Grace. While the aforementioned bands are pretty good, I didnt exactly want to hear another Nu Metal band. Perhaps the next album will go back to that good ol' 41 sound. I'll be waiting till that day comes! Peace Out-Franky"
4,A useful survey,"The best part about this scholarly book is Palmer's development of the somewhat constricted literary language of Classical Latin out of the wider context of the dialects and varying usages of Latium and its environs. Readers should be aware that this is a historical survey of Latin, not a reference grammar or a book to learn the language from. Prior knowledge of the basics of Latin grammar is assumed.In tracing the history of the language, the book necessarily gives a history of Roman literary styles, from the age of Cato and Ennius to the Christian period. While this is not a comprehensive treatment of Latin literature, it is informative.The extensive etymological and comparative information in this book, on the other hand, is somewhat dated, since it was written in a period before the laryngeal theory had thoroughly penetrated Indo-European studies. Its treatment of Latin among the Italic dialects fares somewhat better."
1,impossible quality !,"I also bought this dvd a year ago in a PAL version. I didn't espect it was first class quality, because the price was low. I liked the ballet performance. The dancers did their best very well, but indeed on a to small stage! But the quality of this dvd was very very disappointing. It was almost viewing through a curtain!I don't believe this was because it was an old recording. I have older ballets that are ten times better ! It's a real shame that something went wrong when this ballet was recorded on dvd. Buyers are warned now!"
1,Abysmal,"EsmeraldaIn my opinion, this must surely rate as the most disappointing ballet I have ever seen.The picture quality is poor, probably because it was taken from an old film but what was even worse was the production! The set is very small, allowing the dancers little room to move, resulting in stilted jumps and turns. Even allowing for that, the standard of dancing is well below par, and the choreography poor.I cannot recommend this DVD to anyone, not even as an historic record."
1,Poor Esmeralda,"This ballet written by Cesare Pugni in 1844 has regained here a glimpse of life but it is so abridged,poorly staged and almost amateur-like danced that it turns out to be a dream not come true.In fact,I wish Kirov would ask Mr.Lacotte to help stage this beautiful ballet so that we could enjoy this once beloved ballet."
3,A little disappointed,"It was great, but we were a little disappointed because we wanted to see the famous Esmeralda's solo and it's not on this DVD. Following, the variation I'm talking about: [...]"
5,Rare revival of old ballet from the 1800's,"This ballet was first choreographed by the French balletmaster Jules Perrot in 1844. The Russian balletmaster Marius Petipa redid it in 1886 based on the original by Perrot. It was very popular with the leading ballerinas and became a classic. The story is based on Victor Hugo's ""Notre Dame de Paris"" (The Hunchback of Notre Dame"". The emphasis is on the plight of a gypsy girl who falls in love with a man above her station. A delightful touch is added by the appearance of her live pet goat on stage. This is not the version of the ballet choreographed later on by Agrippina Vaganova."
4,Pretty good toy,"This toy is pretty cool but the horse's hair is WAY TO LONG!!!!Maybe i am being to picky but the horse is not shaped the way it should be.The picture shows the barn open with the fence attached to the walls you can't attach the fence enless the barn is closed!Lots of tiny ""perfume"" bottles and cardboard things.There is a place to hang the Polly's clothes but the clothes don't stay on the hangers!There is a haystack that opens to a chair but she can't sit in it because her clothes won't bend that far!!!BUT over all the bad things it still is good toy for kids!"
3,My 4 year old loves it ... I'm not a fan of it though.,"My 4 year old LOVES Polly Pocket. She loves all the little clothes, the tiny shoes, the accessories, the pets, the modes of transportation. Oh ... the adventures she and Polly and her friends have. She plays with it endlessly and has a great time.I, as a parent, hate it. It's too small and fiddly for my big fingers ... and there is always something to be re-attached, re-configured or an item of clothing for Polly to put on that my daughter needs help with. She loves it when I sit down and play with her but I can't get my big fingers comfortable with this tiny toy.I also have to constant worry of a choking hazard for her little brother (just turned 1) and I have to stand over her to ensure she packs up every single tiny piece of the set.All the Polly Pocket sets we own have been gifts. As a parent - I would find something else to buy my daughter.I am not a fan of this toy at all ... but then i am not a 4 year old little girl either."
4,Great tank movie!,We watched this movie the other night and really liked it! It has great action and Richard Hatch as a bad guy! If you enjoy low budget action movies this one is pretty fun!
4,Very informative; subtly opinionated,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this book and all of the useful information it provides for women during and after pregnancy. Readers should be aware, however, that Goldberg has definite opinions which may slightly color the way she presents material. For healthy women, she advocates the use of midwives and birthing centers over hospitals, natural birth over elective medical interventions, and she does not view circumcision very highly. This worked for me, but if you are of the ""hate pain and need an epidural!"" variety, you are probably not the target audience."
3,"One word: ""It's the best!""","Ok, it may not be ""The Best"", but it was alright. Yeah, alright if you like bad acting, crappy, predictable storylines, and AWEFUL, cheese-ladened, synthesized musice during some of the ""sex"" scenes. What stands out in this film is Shauna O'Brien. She is most enhanced in this movie, but I still thought she looked really, really hot. Worth the price of the disc in my opinion. Gabriella Hall was tasty as per usual and does an interesting scene with a guy and alot of paint. I don't buy these movies for the storylines so I am not to critical on that, I rate them by the hotness of the babes and the simulated sex scenes. This flick delivers fairly well on both fronts."
2,Don't buy this bed,I have had three for theses beds in two years. The last two were replacements. The customer service is awful to talk to anyone you would have to call at the end of the week. It takes them forever to send a replacement . It took them six months to send a replacement the last time. The replacement leaked so I called again and it took another six months for the replacement. I bought a real bed and love it. I 'm still waiting the replacement for the lest bed.
3,Interesting Story; Many Typos,"The story is very intriguing and entertaining however, you will discover that the book doesn't appear to have been edited before it was published. It's an easy read that will keep you entertained."
1,More courtroom drama than true crime book,"If you enjoy reading a detailed summary of a court trial, this is your book. Otherwise, don't bother. A full 50% of the book is committed to the trial and sentencing. There was simply nothing unique or outstanding about the trial that made it worthy of taking up a full 50% of the book. Everything relevant to the crime and victim is known by the time the arrest is made and the trial starts. Everything after that is filler."
3,Easy Read,A very easy book to read. The story is laid out very well and the mystery of it keeps you turning the pages.
4,I like it,"It was written well, but lacked intense investigating. The author could have gone more in depth in his research. Although he did the best he could."
5,Good easy read,"A Good easy read, interesting case and how the justice system it seems can forget the victim and their families."
4,Review,Interesting read...emotional and left me feeling so sad for a young life wasted. would like an update to present day...to see how Karen‘s family is doing.
5,Couldn't put it down!! Remarkably written,This book grabs you from the beginning and won't let go! The story is one of horrific nature and of the great sorrow that Karen Gregory's family and friends suffered. George Lewis proves that he is a deceitful liar. He changed his story each and every time he learns that the police have evidence to prove him wrong. This proves to be his biggest downfall.
5,Unanswered Cries,"I read way more True Crime books than I care to admit. This is one of the best I have read, not due so much to the topic, but rather the writer who kept me interested from page one. I figured out who the murdered was very early in the book, but that did not keep me from being captivated all the way through. This story is full of actual facts, and told in such a way that I could not put it down. Very interesting read and I would surely buy any other true crime books by this writer. You will not be dissapointed."
3,unanswered cries,Since purchasing my Kindle over 2 years ago I was at the mercy of the local library. Free reads are great or in the case of this particular book I was able to get more details of the subject matter and felt it was a book that I would probably read a couple of times with no restrictions and the price was affordable. Thank you for asking my opinion.
3,It's okay- not great,"I read this book several years ago. Although it was well written, I would only recommend this book if there aren't any other true crime books to read. By the time I finished the book I knew more about the murderer than I did the victim."
3,Amateurish writing & poor editing,"The story was good, and a good job was done making me relate to the characters, but some of the sentence structure was off. By that, I'm referring to the authors tendency to flip words around to sound ""off"" to me, like ""she already was..."" rather than ""she was already"" & ""they already were"" rather than ""they were already."" Not breaking any rules, but sounding almost if I were listening to an unpolished person of low intelligence.Also, lots of missing words like ""when became a firefighter;"" and double words like ""the the.""Not a favorite for me, but the story makes you wonder if you REALLY know someone."
2,Unanswered Cries,I found this book repeated a lot of its material. Somehow I felt it could have gotton to the point faster.
3,Poorly written,"A tragic and heart-wrenching story. The fact that the police work was amateur and shoddy makes it all the worse. Fans of true crime will not be disappointed. That said, i found it to be was poorly edited and boringly written."
4,Good solid read and well crafted.,Lots of insight into victim's journey. Keeps you interested all the way through. I think I saw this on TV too.
5,Used in the car,"I got this to use in the car on a road trip and it was fun! There are some simple questions that don't carry a conversation or imagination far, but then there are others that went in all different directions. Our whole family enjoyed it and it was great to not waste that driving time watching movies or listening to the same music over and over."
2,not good at all,way too narrow to be effective for its stated purpose. flimsy and skimpy. not worth the money at all. don't waste yours
5,Door Guards,"I just got these door guards and they looks really solid. It's just metal and tape; peel and place. I held it down for about a minute and then just shut the doors since I figured that'd help a bit more. They look sweet and way better compared to the clear piece of tape that had been applied when I got it. They shipped fast and are exactly as described. One corner was bent a bit, but it wasn't an issue at all jut got a towel and a pair pliers and straightened it out."
5,Great product,"This is a great product, it won't fit 100% but at least it will take care of the every day damage on your Jeep when you get in."
3,Not exactly what I expected,This kick guard doesn't cover enough metal. It's kind of a 'Z' shape and doesn't cover the inside of the vehicle.
2,Smittybilt 7686 Black Entry Guard,"bought the wrong stuff and just put aside, of no use!!! Did not take a good look on it before purchase."
1,Very poor fit,"Dont buy these, get another brand that will actually fit your jeep. Mine look terrible and I would remove them but the 3M tape that sticks them to the entry lip is too strong to not rip up the jeep a bit when taking them off. I'm stuck with them... not cool."
2,Rathbone is good as Richard III,"Considering its presumed low budget, ""Tower of London"" is a fairly elaborate historical drama with Basil Rathbone superb as the scheming Richard III. Otherwise, there isn't much here to recommend. Boris Karloff is good as an executioner, but he has little to do but lumber about looking menacing, and Vincent Price (in his film debut) has a good scene as one of Richard's victims. Earlier in the same year, Rathbone, Karloff, and director Rowland V. Lee collaborated on the excellent ""Son of Frankenstein."" Lightning did not strike twice."
3,wait a minute...,actually the image above is of the 1962 Roger Corman version with Vincent Price in the lead role
2,Keep them longer,"I thought the cover looked great, i was thinking god i cant wait to get this movie, but then something not so good happened, I watched the movie. I personally didn't happen to like it, it's just a bunch of short films no longer than 30 minutes. Out of the seven different films on the dvd i liked two of them the rest were boring and i think pointless. Maybe if the directors of these films could hve put a little bit more of a plot and a few more twists in the movies the dvd might have been worth my time and money. But thats just me and people have many different opinions,so don't let me stop you from buying something thats worth YOUR while, you just might like it. See, Now I need a little time to adjust to what i'm watching you know really get into it but these films dont give you that oppurtunity. They play then just when you're getting into it,its over."
3,Starts out great!,"This DVD consists of 5 short films and has a running cartoon, ""Go Dyke Go"" sandwiched in between each short movie. The first two short films, ""Maid of Honor"" and ""Two Girls and a Baby"" were very good little films that I really enjoyed. Basically, these were characters and stories that I could relate to. I wasn't crazy about the rest of the DVD, although ""Koko"" was a quirky little film that was fast-paced enough to keep me watching. Some of you might enjoy the other films more than I did since we all have different tastes. I can't give an honest review of the ""Go Dyke Go"" animated cartoon, since I admit I fast forwarded through it. Three stars because the first two films were worth it!"
2,Not very good,"The wedding skit was a good part, but it's the only reason to buy this DVD; and it still had it flaws. Not a good collection in a lot of respects."
1,This Toy Is Junk!,The planes launcher was very difficult for my child to use. It was always stuck. Also the planes' wings did not expand upon take off regularly therefore one ripped duting its last flight. We were very dissappointed with the quality of this toy.
4,The book passed the reality check!,"Wether you like or don't like the book may depend very much on wether you are a technocrat, an artist or a craftsman. But I like the book mainly because it almost perfectly describes and interprets the developments within some organizations which I had and have to deal with.Are Pitcher's theories good enough to be used for predictions, i.e. about the development of carreers? The book passed that test too.In Germany the well known weekly magazine DIE ZEIT (1997/09/12, page 26) recommended the German edition of Pitcher's book (""Das Führungsdrama"") to their readers."
1,Not worth the read!!,Extracts constitute > 60% of the material in this book. Author's simplistic & subjective opinions make up the rest.
5,great blade,great blade-bought a diablo 80 tooth and for twice the price and half the performance of the Hitachi.
3,angel loves,"when i first heard of this anime, i thoiught it sounded really cool. i saw the first 2 eps a few summers ago. i rented it from a blockbuster store. the art and story line wasnt too bad, but i was a little dissapointed. there was no romantic plot taht was overly noticable. then a friend of mine bought this dvd collection, and brought it to a sleepover party. there was a noticable difference from the ealier eps and the newer ones. i greatly enjoyed the newer ones. the art was much better. my fave eps was the last one. the sex scene between the two male angels was short and very angsty, leaving me wanting more. but overall, it was a good anime."
4,More Shonen-ai than I hoped,"^.^ I thought this story would be about the angels and how the we humans are judged. Um, no. Wrong. It's about Chihaya and his partner Kagetsuya. There's a plot line, and yeah you get stories about angels judgeing humans and the world being saved and destroyed and all that. But really it's the character and relationship develpment with the two main cast members. It was my first DVD I bought, and I was quiet thrilled. I'm a rabid yaoi fan girl and I thought little Chihaya would only give hints and leave me guessing. But nope, they even sleep in the same bed. So yep, I'm happy! ^.^ What next... Kizuna or Fake? Hmm..."
3,"Ok, but not fantastic.","It's a pretty simple product, so not a whole lot to say. It came packaged well with no damage. Very easy to put together and place the decals. The pieces stay together well and fall apart on impact as they should. My only gripe is the ability to perform loops/stunts. It performs level flight fairly well, but I can't get it to do loops. The elevator adjustment does very little and is somewhat loose. Overall, it's ok."
1,not worth it,"Purchased as gift for seven year old. Assumed he would get a kick out of the size. Item came broken in two places, shipping box was not damaged so appears item was packed and most likely sent out broken. I fixed it with wood glue and tape, wings fell off every two glides, item was extremely cheap and broke further. After about twenty minutes, plane was ready for the garbage. Dont waste your time with this product."
2,Broken,"As numerous people of commented, they do not seem to be able to ship this without breaking it. Also, it's just not as cool as the toy you remember from your childhood. I wanted to love this, but can not even like it."
4,Eating my leftovers,"I haven't been able to check on them in a while but so far so good. Package arrived in a timely manner. I thought most were dead because they weren't moving around that much. But checking on them a week later, and they all seem to be doing their jobs."
3,Search & Destroy,"Despite other bad reviews about this filmm, I consider it to be a difficult plot at the start with a bit of poor sound quality, but after a few minutes the sound is great in digital & after twenty minutes the plot certainly livens up to a full blown, believable action film, you really have to put yourself in the actors positions to make this film fantastic, note: my copy was sent to 'england' where it was opened, unwrapped & maybe watched by the customs authorities who then forwarded it on with inspected stickers all over the case. buy it, it could be you."
3,Nice little George A Romero take-off,"Low budget for sure, but it grows into an effective little film. You know towards the end of Night of the Living Dead where the red necks are shooting anything that moves? It has some of that flavor. Though I'm sure another Romero film, The Crazies, had a more direct influence. The infected army team does a good job of drawing you into their plight and the night time fire fight is the most authentic I've seen since Viet Nam. This is a tidy little film and a good deal for the price."
1,search and destroy,"Im a bad action movie fan but this is bad and i mean really bad. The picture quality and acting are subpar, it's just hard to watch but i did. I can watch movies over and over,doub't i'll sit through this again.Gave it one star 'cause i had to, Spend your money on ROGUE FORCE, much better bang for your buck. Stars Robert Patrick (the other terminator from terminator 2)"
1,But it has nothing to do with the original work!,"M. Thenadier moved to America to become a slave trader at the end of Les Miserables. Inspector Javert not only died, his body was found dead in an ending that Victor Hugo declared to be one of his best and should not be changed or he would never write another word. Well, since he's not writing any more, it has been changed. Marius didn't have a penchant for getting involved with dubious people - indeed, his participation in the student uprising was motivated by idealism.If this book had characters with different names, and did not say ""Sequel to Les Miserables"", perhaps it would be better.Really, this is a sequel to the musical, not the book."
3,Where was the end?,"Ok, so it starts a little slow but by the end of the first chapter you're hooked. It's well written with an intricate plot that has you hooked... until page 300 or so when you realise that there are not enough pages left to satisfy the story. I was gripped and then it was all over. Where was the end?The three main characters are left stranded somewhere in the ether and you're left just as forgotten as they are. Maybe I am missing a sequel or something, if so, when I find it, I won't be as severely disappointed as I am.This author had me eating out of the palm of his hand. Perhaps this was the cunning intention all along- only now I am fuming at the lack of conclusion to an otherwise wonderful, almost perfect book."
3,Cosette or The Time of Illusion,"As a die hard fan of Les Miserable I purchased this book in a sale bin. I found the first few chapters a little dry and a little hard to get into,but kept reading and found the book to be actually quite good. The plot was complicated, and I thought very similar to the story of the Count of Monte Cristo. As Javert (Verjat) begins to unravel Marius misfortune, I wondered too how they would wrap everything up in a few pages. Well, they didn't. Did Ceresa forget that a story needs an ending. Is there a sequel that is coming, or is Marius the Fugitive the sequel? Is there an English version? What a dissapointment to come to the end of the book with the fate of the main characters still in the air. While I enjoyed the book in itself, it was rather strange to get to the end, and find there was none."
3,hand made,i had been loking forward to this video but i really wasnt what i expected. It just looked like something hand made. Should have saved my money!
2,Not much more than what's already available on website,The website provides almost all the info free that is on the video so I was disappointed that it cost so much.
1,High schoolish tripe,"Poorly written, with far too much religious pontification, this book ultimately is disappointing survival horror. Although it's better than its competitors--The Book of the Dead, Still Dead, The Rising--it's still amateurish shlock whose characters far too often launch into pedantic multi-page theological discussions when they're not dying a page or two after they've been introduced.If you want something scary, read Noel Hynd's Ghosts. Or for a thriller, read almost anything by Childs/Preston.For survival horror, better just to watch the various zombie pictures again."
3,Not a standard zombie book,"I bought this book for the same reasons a lot of people on Amazon do, and that's from the great reviews. The zombies in this book aren't your standard zombies. They think, speak, work together, etc... I personally don't like zombie books that change zombies away from the mindless cannibals most people think of, but other than that part, this book was decent enough. Very stereotypical characters, a lot of religious discussion, and a predictable outcome, but all in all it was worth the read."
5,Not your innocuous Christian fiction!,"This is a great book- The characterization is uncommonly sharp, the philosophical dialogue is astute and funny, and best of all, it's REALLY REALLY SCARY! These zombies are the velociraptors of the living dead world, fast, intelligent, and utterly nasty AND if that wasn't enough, we also get wolves made of bones and...a New Jersey State Trooper. Highly recommended for anyone who likes their hardcore theological discourse liberally spiked with shredded flesh. :)"
5,One of the best ever!,"Let me make this easy. This is one of the best Zombie books i have ever read. This book has all the zombies, guts and blood you could ask for with so so so much more.Every page is the next step closer to hell. I really felt like i was seeing the world live! A must have! A must buy! 5 stars no prob! I can't put into words how good this was!"
5,epilszak@yahoo.com,"Wow. How to start. Well, this book gained notoriety in my circle of friends, getting passed around from one to another. Then, it was my turn. I was hooked from the first, being a fan of zombie movies and such. A strange thing happened as I read The Dead. The book starts to get into a lot of Catholic theology, but never gets preachy, more of an explanatory tone; hey, here's what I beleive, etc., through one of the characters, to explain what is happening. Instead of this bogging down the book, it drew me in even more, having had a Catholic upbringing. A real tension is developed among the characters; who will make it through this, and why. The main bad guy/king zombie/demon is genuinely terrifying, not because he's some kind of typical bad mofo, but because he knows your sins, he knows your worst secrets, and is ready to hand out retribution for them. All in all, this is a great twist on the worn out zombies back from the dead genre."
5,Edge of your seat,"I read this book several years ago and I have went back since then and reread the book several times. I really enjoyed the book and the characters especially how the author weaves biblical aspects into the book. He uses the rapture, good versus evil,to show how the world ends."
4,Intriguing story line,This is a great zombie adventure with a different twist.This does a great job of showing the a family recognizing and having to choose between good and evil.I recommend this to anyone who can handle the language and violence.It's worth the wade...
2,Not a fan,"Couldn't finish it... Read the first 5 chapters, then the last two. That's all you need. I would not recommend it."
4,Very interesting point of view,"This book was very surprising to me because I was not expecting so much religion. I thought it was going to be another zombie novel. It was very graphic and detailed and I felt like I could create a perfect image of what the author was trying to portray, even though some things I would rather not imagine. It had all the must haves for a zombie novel, but provided another point of view that I've never seen before. It was a really good read and recommend it."
2,"Interesting, But Ultimately a thinly veiled sermon","The author has an interesting take on the Romero zombie, with several very good gruesome scenes throughout the book. The author also weaves a very compelling setting of despair and gloom throughout his new zombified world. However, he mars the story-telling experience by injecting page after page of theological debates between the main characters. Ultimately the book veers away from the tried and true goodness of zombie killing fun fiction and into a thinly veiled sermon waxing on about Judgment Day and Christianity. I have no problems with religion, but I don't want to be lectured in my leisure time reading. Additionally the climax and subsequent resolution of the book and it's main characters is not satisfying."
2,"Decent, but not Great","This book is OKAY, but definitely not a great read. Lots of misspellings and grammatical errors, and the author's own pentecostal religious outloook (which is strange, because all the main characters in the book are Catholic), make it feel as if you're reading the Turner Diaries as envisioned by George Romero.There are still some good scares provided, just don't expect this to be a well-written book."
2,One of the worst books I've ever read,"Sorry, I have to depart from the general consensus and say that, as a writer myself, this book was awful. Aside from the stereotypical depictions of women being creatures of bovine stupidity, the typographical errors on EVERY single page were outrageous, all the characters were completely one-dimensional, and the ending was utter garbage. This was neither scary nor thought-provoking, but laughable at best. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that the concept was a good idea. It was, however, very badly carried out. I have not read anything else by Mark E. Rogers, and judging from this I probably never will."
2,Setting the Zombie genra back to the stoneages...,"With very few good zombie survival books to choose from, wasting your money on The Dead is exactly that, a waste of money. Do not let the cover of this book fool you, it's really just a sermon in sheeps clothing. Filled with fire and brimstone, it places the action behind the thinly laid subtext, God God and more God. By page eight you're already tired of the thinly laid debates between all of the main characters (who are all religious figures of some kind). The plot is somewhat pacing for the story but the dialog thrown in is truly a tragity. The characters are predictible and poorly thought out. Do not waste your time. If your in the market for a good book minus the sermon, buy Reign of the Dead and call it a day."
1,Not even close.,"The author uses this book as his own platform for expressing his religious preference.... disses a very good stephen king... and there are so many freaking typos in this book its hard to read. if you want a good zombie novel go with the Autumn series by David Moody or Day by day armageddon.this book gave me a headache 3 times before i finished it due to the arguments between the fundamentalist preacher, the orthodox catholic priest and the survivalist.... that should pretty much say it all."
2,What book did all those other reviewers read???,"I read the Dead by Rogers and I have to say that it was really bad.The story isn't horrible. The action scenes at least work, very reminiscent of either Romero's work or that old Dead World comic.But interspersed are long dialogues about the nature of man and God and the Devil. NOT kidding. This book is fundementalist and the dead coming back to life are there to punish sinners.Thought I'd read it all (I did read this whole book) before but this one was a first.If the author reads this...please in future editions, make the religious sections in a red font so readers know what to skip."
2,boring,"A little too theological and unbelievable for me. Kept wanting to stop reading, but pushed myself thinking it would get better. It doesn't."
3,"All right, not stellar.","This book was rather mediocre. There were some good scenes here and there and the overall premise was interesting, but it almost felt like I was being pushed to pick a religion. Very reminiscent of the movie called LEGION with Dennis Quaid.Buy it when it hits $.99, otherwise buy three cheap ones with better stories."
1,The Dead left me Dead,"I started this book in the hopes of reading a horror story, but what I got was sadly disappointing. I like books in which I can relate to some of the characters. After reading about a third of the book, I wanted to kill them myself. The problem with the book is that it is too ""preachy."" The author droned on and on about religious beliefs, biblical concepts, christianity, etc., which took away from the story. Or was it the story? It was really hard to tell. The book was a mystery to me from the beginning to end. What was it really about? The Rapture with zombies. Not a good mix. The only favorable parts of the book was the commando-style fighting of some of the characters and the zombies, but after a while even that became cliche."
4,Well written and hard to put . down.,Great story of good versus evil and the struggle to make amends. Makes you reevaluate your concept of the world's end.
2,"start strong, but fades.","I previewed this book, and bought it based on an interesting start. My feelings became more negative the further I read. Seemed to become more of a treatise about God, faith and religion as it progressed. It seems the author has issues with various religions. I felt lectured to."
2,"THE DEAD - eh, didn't really like","Went on way too long with no explanation of exactly who was doing this and/or WHY. Or perhaps it did but the SAME things kept happening over & over again making me forget the reason. I did finish it, though - only to see if it would redeem itself. But it didn't. At least not for me. I guess I just don't like religious / christian type themes?? (If that's what this was). Mark Rogers does have the gift of writting, though - I just didn't like this story."
3,"""Left behind"".....with Zombies!","Plenty of religious sermons....with plenty of flesh eating.Is it just me, or is that a strange combo?But it's a pretty good book...probably 3 and 1/2 stars.I thought the characters were fairly fleshed out and the action sequences were very well done.I'm a big fan of zombie fiction and if you are too...you won't want to miss THE DEAD.The only two minuses in this book are the excessive religious discussions and the typos.And I mean ALOT of typos...words running together, misspelling and so on.Plan on seeing a typo about every other page...if that sort of editing gets on your nerves, you might want to stay away from this one."
5,Zombie Apocalypse with a Religious twist,"Just finished ""The Dead"" from Mark E. Rogers. What a fantastic read! Plus the fact i'm a local Jersey Shore native and I recognized all of the places, roads, landmarks he mentioned in the book. The accuracy of the locale and such made it even better! The one thing i did not understand is that he changed the names of all the towns (i.e. Point pleasant ---> Bayside Point, Seaside Heights ---> Oceanview Heights, Barnegat Bay ----> Barrangaset bay etc etc)regardless of that minor minor complaint, maybe it's legality related who knows.. the story is an awesome awesome read for the end of days with a nice focus on Religion as the main source of the armageddon. The book is an excellent read for any permuted press fan, I would totally recommend this book even if you are Agnostic or perhaps Athiest this is still a fantastic read with a great story/setting."
1,Another unauthorized rip-off.,"Poor quality in every aspect and supposedly unauthorized in the first place. A quote from Ian's own website -""If anybody sees an album called Standing In The Light on a label called Alchemy, DON'T BUY IT. These pathetic pigs have been screwing me for years. I.H.""Enough said!"
3,A Reissue,"This is a reissue of the Missing In Action/Collateral Damage double CD. The first CD is a great recording of a different performance/same tour as Welcome To The Club. The second disc is from various sources and suffers from varying quality of recording; it's strictly for collectors.For a more comprehensive document of the incredible tour that followed You're Never Alone With A Schizophrenic, seek out the expanded Welcome To The Club set. If you crave rarities there are some great ones here, including live versions of Letter to Brittania, (I'm) the Teacher, and Woman's Intuition."
1,Already done...and better,The quality on alot of these live tracks is terrible. I gave it one star just because it's Ian Hunter. Half of it is like a bad bootleg. I was really disappointed.Better off with Welcome to the Club.
1,"Poor, poor Ian! (One star for his hapless fans.)","Poor Ian isn't getting any royalties from this? Why on earth should someone care if this old coot (he'll be 67 in June!)is getting compensation? Do you think he cares about your financial well-being, living the high life in his cozy little mansion in New Milford, CT.? Get a life, will you? Stop living vicariously through these rock stars who wouldn't know how to function in the real world if their lives depended on it!!!!"
4,Topnotch Light Fare,"It must be said at the outset that ""Redeye"" is not only slim but lightweight, and its storyline a fragile structure indeed. Having said that, I have nothing left but praise for this book. Edgerton deftly weaves together an adventurous present in 1892 Colorado, a tragic past from 1857, and a framing text from 1915, by which time historic sites and scenic grandeur have degenerated into new ways to separate the unwary tourist from his money. He draws his characters, from the sweet and naive to the most dastardly, with a light and loving touch. He knows and appreciates his setting, and can instill this appreciation in his readers. He has worthwhile things to say on important matters--multi-ethnic society, the role of archeology, the profit motive--but makes his points without being moralistic or pedantic. And, oh yes, the man can be very funny. Edgerton knows what he's about, and has the talent and humanity do it well. An evening with ""Redeye"" is time well spent."
2,Creative style but ...,"I read it on a business trip because that's all I had to read, but once I got access to a different book- only a few scant pages from the end, I happily traded it in."
2,Not His Best,"I loved Raney and Walking Across Egypt, but only got 60 pages into Redeye.The situations and characters are intended to be odd and humorous, in the wry manner Edgerton does so well - and yet I wasn't laughing. Could be me or my current mood - the writing is good and clever - but Redeye didn't do it for me."
5,Great -- watch the whole thing -- the ending makes the rest,The ending makes this understandable. This is currently my favorite. Well worth it! A few episodes leave you wondering what they have to do with it but on whole it is great and even those slower episodes have a place after you've seen the whole thing.
3,Little Bear is Awesome!,"This book is great for kids just learning to read. The pictures are fun to look at, and kids will have fun reading the book. I thought it was a good idea to put different stories into one book so kids can choose what the want to read on their own."
3,good stories - slightly awkward format,"My 2 1/2 year old asks for these stories every night right now. The stories are mighty fine - if sort of retro - (mother bear is always baking cakes while father bear is off working) but in this case, I'm willing to overlook it because the tone is very sweet. This edition is a bit awkward - the pages are rather small and scrunched together. Still, a good buy."
5,Little Bear,Great book. We have watched the Little Bear stories on TV for years. Now our 7 years old is reading the stories. It is the first book that he was excited about reading.
3,make up,"Fairly easy to smooth on, good coverage ,, good product except price is too high. there are other brands in drug stores that cost less and is just as good, like Max Factor products for coverage"
2,Crap !!!,"I would not recommend anyone even considering to buy this book. It is a big piece of crap, which doesnt contain any technical info, just plain business say."
4,A Good Buy.,A typical Revel item---it is not for te one with no patience as it does require a lot of detail involvement. This needs a lot of involvement and time but I AM SURE with proper care and diligence the end item will be worth it all. GOOD LUCK
2,Very fun to build.,At the begginging is looks hard to build but it gets easier as you go on. Never in my life have I built a modle until now
3,uhhhhhh............,Came with too many tiny parts that was hard for me to put on. Fell apart after gluing it together. Maybe I got the wrong kind of glue. Looks great once its put together. This just wasnt for me.
3,very slow,Its a very slow read. Dragged out to much. Just needed to get on with story instead of repeating a lot of info
4,Predictable but nice,Somewhat predictable but nice. Wiggs is a good author. Her stories always pull me in.
2,"Too much family, not enough romance","JD was sizzlin', Kate was hot, and the potential for one smokin' romance was there, but it fell flat amidst all the family drama. Not my cup of tea. Too much about the son Aaron, too much about the foster runaway Callie, just too much emotional baggage with the kids. And not enough romance or scenes with the two main lovers."
5,Leaves You Contented,"This book also makes you long for a life that gives you summers away in a gorgeous part of the world, filled with family traditions and history. The premise of the story is strong; love can be found in unlikely places and hurdles overcome by speaking honestly. We protect ourselves so much sometimes that we may miss what is there in the moment. A very enjoyable read, ripe for a series (I need to see if there is one!)"
1,A mullet??,"Okay, I have not read this book yet, but already I'm discouraged after reading the first few pages. You mean to tell me we have to try to picture a guy being sexy who has a mullet??? I don't know how I'll be able to read this book...I would think most people would like their heroes a little more clean cut. A mullet?? Yuck."
4,A summer of new beginnings,"A romance so if you do not like that genre, then I suggest you choose another book. However, it is far more than that. It is a story of generosity as a single mom easily opens her heart and home to a runaway teen. At the same time she is unwilling to open herself to the possibility of love from JD. There is also the story of how the media hounds unwilling persons and makes life miserable for them. It starts a bit strangely and makes the reader wonder where it is going--just stick with it. It all comes together in a happily ever after manner, but there is much in between. A great read and I highly recommend it."
5,What a great feel good story!,"I read this in just a few days and fell in love with all the characters. I can't say much without revealing the end but this story completely captivated me.Kate is a likeable person with a good kid and a big heart. Callie is just a scared young girl trying to do the right thing.JD is hot, lovable and a typical guy with no basis for dealing with his feelings. Somehow, they all mixed well and engrossed me in their lives. I hated for it to end, as I want to continue with these people's lives."
3,Lakeside Cottage.,I really enjoyed this book. Read it in one evening. Will read more of Susan Wiggs books. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
3,Useful for home movies,"I bought this at a Wal-Mart in Mountain View, MO when I was a senior in High School and I've used the crappola out of it since then for lots of little home movie stuff. Not the best sound effects collection out there by any means but it's been really useful to me."
3,I was named after the island,"My dad was born there in the 1950's and i was named after it. not a bad place, not much to do but nice to visit. the book is informal but informative."
2,Opinon on Arthritis Mgmt.,"I was and am very disappointed in the magazine ""Arthritis Mgmt."" It doesn't seem like it has actual arthritis help suggestions, just a bunch of words to fill up space."
1,A waste of money,"Only a newbie, who doesn't have a good doc would ever need this magazine. The Arthritis Foundation's, Arthritis Today is MUCH BETTER and a better buy."
5,perfect ruler,"Thick steel 15CM/6Inch machineist rule, 1/10th and 1/100 standard, 1mm and .5MM markings for metric no fractions.If only they had a 30CM version (12 inch)"
1,I agree with the above review,"The authors of this book are truely using this ""text"" as a platform to preach their ideals. The authors about how unfair the U.S. system is and how it is going to change to conform to their views (this will never happen)is sickening.It is not a good ""text"" book and professors should never subject their students to this mess of a ""learning tool."""
1,Visions of Liberal Indoctrination,"My soul weeps for the trees that were used to print this steaming pile of dung. I actually cannot believe that I attend a college that would subject their students to this collection of liberal garbage. It is quite evident that the authors of this book have zero actual experience in the field of criminal justice; they are only armchair warriors who believe that their academic vision for the world is the only true way for CJ administrators to conduct themselves. Here is a quote from the ""authors""- not a third party. ""This important text was written by persons who have the needed expertise in those areas that are of major concern to all our citizenry. The future has unfolded, and our visions for the next several decades must continue to grow and to be realized."" (pg 11) What a bunch of narcissistic garbage. Do yourself a favor and avoid this collection of idiocy if you can (I am unfortunately forced to digest this vile drivel)."
1,Still Haven't Received Book,30 days after shipping and 4 emails to the seller later and I still haven't received my book. Wonder if they plan on getting around to it before the semester concludes?
2,A Good Place to Start,"The Butt Book is a good place to start if you want an introduction to exercises for your bottom and thighs. Like several of the other books on the market, it devotes a great deal of time, attention, and book space to diet and eating habits. That stuff seems like a no-brainer to me, and I was disappointed that Ms. Reno didn't include more exercises. If there is ever a revised edition, it would be nice if the exercises were photographs instead of drawings, and if they showed proper technique instead of just one phase of the exercises."
4,A Great Start to a Great Butt,"This book is very good for any female who wants to start getting their lower body looking toned and sexy. Most of the exercises are basic enough for the beginer to do properly.As an Exercise Physiologist and Personal Trainer, I was pleased to see the simple and realistic advice on proper nutrition and the importance of cardiovascular exercise. As these are crucial elements to 'having a nice butt'.Even some 'veteran fitness enthusiasts' will get something out of this book if they are looking to fine tune their rear end.Definitely a good tool to have (and use) in your female fitness library."
2,Nothing New,"Although this book was straight forward about how we get an undesirable rear in the first place, and also humorous at times; it did not contain anything new in the way of targeting that area. A very limited section on specific exercises. I was hoping for more of a training manual that would show specific exercises and the correct way to perform them. It was however, a book to help motivate you to do what you already know - eat right and exercise."
4,Very enjoyable read,"Light reading, but very informative. Great book for understanding how your muscles work. Lots of excercises with pictures, very helpful!"
3,This is a beginners book,"This is a good book. However, everything in it isn't anything I don't already know. It's a good starter book, and a good refresher book."
1,Be careful!!,"if anyone out there thinking about buying a book which can guide/provide information how to ""work-out"" to make your butt nice/healthy looking, do not buy this book.as much as i understand how important diet is for working out, total abour 150 pages book, pure work out tips only last 7pages, the rest about eating tips, this is total fraud. make it worse? those eating tips you might find food channel for sure. do not waste your money on this book!!!"
5,The best how to for a great butt!,This book was the best tool for shaping my legs and butt after having a baby!!Trying for baby #2 and will be ready to use all the great info from the book to stay in shape during my pregnancy & after!!
5,A christmas Carol (Read and Listen Book),A Christmas Carol (Read & Listen Books)Bought to use in public school for enrichment. They loved it!
5,So Much Better Than Mastering The Art of French Cooking,"This is a much better book than the highly-touted book by Julia Child et al (which simply uses too much butter, fat or sugar, etc. to be suitable for today's life style). This book has very clear instructions and the results are yummy! This is my go-to book together with The Joy of Cooking."
2,biblical,"Very imposing treatise on life! Everything and more that I hoped to ever learn. I just wish I had ten days to read the whole thing. No matter how I tried, I could not find the appeal of the book. It is a classic, but don't be surprised if it disappoints you. If so, pass it along to someone else. Invaluable but dry."
4,Meh,FUNimation did not make this movie. The voices were done by completely different people and it bugged me up that i couldn't get through the whole thing
3,Yu Yu Hakusho Fans,"Ill Pay a few bucks to see a couple 30 minute episodes of my favorite anime of all time. This series is great, personally I'd watch the series before you continue expanding your collection. It would be innovative for Funimation to create a new movie for the series, Who knows they just made a Trigun Movie with the original cast, Fingers crossed! I'll update this review after i watch it."
3,It's ok,"It's was worth the 3$ I payed for it. One thing i was not to happy about was the voices in yu-yu hakusho are not the ones from the show on TV. However the ninku movie was a funny movieP.S. the ""movies"" are only 30 min long"
3,Ninku rules!,"Well, to begin with I'll say that no retail dvd should exist with less than an hour of footage on it, and that's a huge problem with this, but hey, at least Anime Works brought this stateside. Anyway, Yu Yu Hakusho was a complete mess in every way, and the dub is the least of its problems, so let's move on to Ninku. The animation is top-notch, the pacing is perfect for such a short feature and the characters are awesome! I've never seen the actual series, but this makes me want to watch it. On a side note, I bet Masashi Kishimoto of Naruto has seen or read Ninku. What a ripoff."
1,...it sucks,"If you are a really big fan of Yu Yu Hakusho, I'm pretty sure you might puke when you see this movie. The characters are not how they were in the series, the voice dubbing is different since it wasn't done by Funimation, and the story was pretty stupid. Basically, your not missing out on anything if you don't get it. They don't give out any new information. And as for the other movie, Ninku. It seems like just a waste of time."
3,Interesting,I thought this was a very interesting series. It is not for kids. I thought the story was very unclear and that it was not really worth buying.
3,Ouch,"Picked this title up at my friendly pawnshop. Even then it was probably overpriced. My kids, who are huge YYH fans were bummed - especially by the voice-overs and the 30 minute length. Still, it was fun griping about the changes.The Ninku movie is also about 30 minutes, but even worse quality. Not sure we will watch it more than once. Looks like the same animators and voice overs from Zatchbell.Suggestion: Buy used and realize you are getting an hour or less of product!!! Otherwise, enjoy :)"
1,A Waste of Time,"I didn't even get through this movie all the way, yet in the first five minutes or so I found myself saying, ""Gods... This is absolutely horrible."" The voices are different, and the characters' personalities aren't even right! Even if you're a crazed YYH fan like myself, this simply isn't worth your time or money."
1,O MY GOD,"I am a SUPER Yu Yu Hakusho fan! However, this movie was horrible. The voices were different, which screwed up the movie bad as far as I am concerned. AND, as if that weren't enough, they changed the whole attidutes of the characters. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR DIE HARD HAKUSHO FANS!:("
3,Not a bad guide,"When I bought this,you had a choice between this one and the 'unauthorized' one. I grabbed this one because the illustrations were really good. Plus,it helped me through the stuck spots. Sure,there's no bestiary list or over world map but this is from a time before game guides were the size of a Sears catalog. Remember when those were huge? If you just want a good guide to help through stuck points,get this one."
1,nightwing shot down in flames ...,"The Black Summer album showed us a very promising band. They had the sound and the talents anyone could wish for. But with this album they really blew it all ! Alec, the guitar player, is no longer doing the vocals and a feller called Max Bacon (who sounds like a Mc Donald's burger in every way )has taken his place. What a shame. Musically they changed direction and followed the fashion of the-middle-of-the-eighties-soft-butt-metal, which was a great disappointment. The production is also ""small budget"". Maybe they thought "" let's make a quick album full of sing-along tunes for the masses and get rich "", but what I'd like to know is how many copies they got to sell ..."
5,Excellent Seasoning,I use this (and the chicken flavor) mostly as a seasoning rather than a soup. Great for stews and such; I like a bit with sauteed or roasted potatoes. Can replace some or all of the salt for different recipes. Price here at Amazon is a deal since I do use enough of this for the 12-pack.
2,Disappointing!,"Maybe this CD was carefully recorded and a true labor of love, especially with the involment of the composer and a famous tenor. However, it leaves me disappointed. This may be because I fell in love with a previous recording of Misa Criolla and Navidad Nuestra, one that was done in the 60's with singers in a South American church. It had all the earthly and folksy tones that one would associate with a Misa Criolla, a mass celebrated by common folks whose fervor elevated their musicality to heights that no operatic tenor or church choir can hope to attain, no matter how hard they try. That recording grew on me and I never tired of listening to it. But, unfortunately I thoughtlessly gave it away when I got rid of my vinyl records some years ago. Later, when I found this CD, I couldn't wait to hear it, but I am sorry to say that it cannot compare to the original recording. If any one still has that one, I would really appreciate if you would let me make a copy of it."
5,Glorious sounds,"This excellent album is something to treasure. If you ever buy only one CD with Jose Carreras, this one might just be the one!!!Although this was recorded just before the treatment for leukemia started (I believe Carreras already knew about it), it was the perfect choice at that time. His voice retains it's beautiful pureness throughout, which no one can match, and he doesn't need to force his instrument. Listen to some of the phrasing, especially when he is singing pianissimo in the slow passages, it's almost unbelievebly beautiful. The way he ""speaks"" the words and the depth of emotion, he is inside the music, inside the the words. That the composer was present (playing the piano) does of course add to the glorious result of these sacred pieces. It is definitely a CD to sit (or lie on the sofa) and really listen to preferably with the volum turned up a good deal. Here lies the greatness of Carreras......"
1,Not the One,"I first heard a ""misa criolla"" track of the Lord's Prayer ( in spanish of course) on our Classic fm station and immediately call them what is the album title. They said it is a Philips album but it is out of circulation. When I found this on the net, excitedly purchased it and listened. What a dissapointment!!I expected a folk guitar accompanied singer but all I have is too much confusion on what I am hearing. It is made with too much orchestration which require a hall not your serene listening room. Too bad I missed the folk version."
2,Dismayed and disappointed,"This version of the Misa Criolla is elegant, restrained and polished, three adjectives that have nothing to do with the raw and rousing folk original. It's about as close to its roots as a gilded church crucifix is to the piece of lumber Christ was crucified on... I'll stick with my raspy 70s recording and relish it!"
2,This Misa is a definite miss.,"I have always loved the original 1960's LP version of Misa Criolla by Los Fronterizos, but it had been unavailable for years. I bought this CD version by Jose Careras, but was utterly disappointed by his almost ""operatic"" approach to what is supposed to be an earthy peasant mass. It just doesn't work.Fortunately, the wonderful original version, digitally remastered, is now available on CD. It has a simple purple and black image of the crucifixion on the cover (see the second of the small customer images above) instead of the original orange 1960's LP cover , but is in every other way the definitive recording of this wonderful piece.Look for it on Amazon and buy it - you'll love it!"
5,Family Fun Card Game - Phase 10,My grandson loves this game and we are going to the beach. We'll have plenty of time for challenging games for the whole gang!
4,love to play,This is a great game for two people or more. I must admit that we usually don't keep score just play to see who goes out first and wins.
4,a good game to play,"I saw Phase 10 in stores, and I wanted to buy this card game. I took this game on vacation with me this year. I enjoyed playing the game with my sister. I can't wait until I play again . My Mom wants to learn how to play too. I liked the label on the box. ""Made in the U.S.A."
5,Great Card Game!,"I had never heard of this game until my friend brought it over one night. I was immediately hooked on the game. I've always enjoyed playing cards, so having a new card game in my repertoire is a bonus. There was only two of us playing and it was fun, but as I read other reviews I look forward to playing it with a larger group of people. I am going to buy my own deck and have it on hand around the house, and bring it on the family vacation over the holidays. The game has a combination of elements that will make it fun for everybody. It is essentially a great twist on the classic game of rummy. Learning the game is relatively quick, and you will see how it works after a few rounds. Once you've caught on, you will be coming up with your own additional ""Phases"" in no time! I enjoyed the game very much, and wanted to write this review to get the word out there and have other people give this game a chance. I hope you find it as enjoyable I do."
1,Explain?,"I looked up Phase 10, searching for a card game costing $5-$7. Instead I find this book (???) for $231, but the customers' comments clearly refer to the game. WHAT'S GOING ON?"
3,"A little tiresome, frankly","I have to say I played the dice version of this game, but it's a little tiresome having to remember the 10 seperate phase combinations and then proceed thru each one methodically. Not a spontaneous game, a bit laborious for my taste, fyi"
2,Lugosi Steals the Show,"""One Body Too Many"" (1944) is a routine Jack Haley mystery-comedy with decent production values and an agreeable supporting cast. The ""B"" programmer remains notable for Bela Lugosi's delightful presence as a coffee-serving butler - the funniest of his red-herring roles. In fact, Bela garners more laughs than Haley's cut-rate version of Bob Hope."
5,Realistic,"If you are wanting to watch a movie that deals with real emotion, with the grittier side of reality, this is the movie for you. There is a chance you will be able to relate on some level to what the characters have gone through. Great acting as well. 5 stars :)"
2,An otherwise good movie with a lackluster ending,"I like my movies much bloodier and far more suspenseful however this movie doesn't claim to be anything other than a drama so I'm not going to knock off any points for not showing very much violence and a sorta slow moving plot.The acting was fantastic and it was a great cast.But for me, the ending left me with too many unanswered questions and that will ruin a movie every time.I mean, it's one thing to sit through an entire movie and be starved of any sort of excitement but as long as there's a bombshell at the end, that can make it all worthwhile. That didn't happen here."
4,Good Flick,"This movie was great. Cheadle gives a good performance, and Zooey adds a nice touch, but the star, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, makes this movie great with his dedication to acting, and his stellar portrayal of a boy lost in his anger. I recommend, especially for and JGL fans"
3,Very Underated Film,I recently caught this movie on The Movie Channel. I think as it stands the movie was a solid tale filled with surprise performances. I found myself reminded of the novel A Million Little Pieces several times while watching. If you can find this movie at your local video store to rent or at a bargain price point it is worth it the time.
4,Why is the squirrel so expensive???,"Maybe because it's my dog's favorite...I bought one at PetsMart and only paid $7...not paying any more than that for a dog toy, sorry!!"
2,"enjoyed it, while the handle stayed on","looks nice. did tea well. handle just fell off, the hold cracked off. ah, well..."
1,Serious problems with this software,"This may be fun if it worked. There are problems with Spades, Rummy, Blackjack and Hearts and I did not even play all the games. I definitely would not recommend buying this software. You won't notice the problems right away but these games all have problems in scoring. Spades freezes up with error messages when bidding and scoring, Rummy has problems with scoring, Blackjack won't let you buy insurance and Hearts has a problems in bidding. I can't speak of the other games as I uninstalled and returned the product before playing any more."
5,Peter Bert's descendants,"Excellent and thorough genealogy source for Peter Bert's descendants. The Hoover sisters that he married, in which the entire lineage comes from, are my 3rd great aunts. Their paternal ancestors however are much more difficult to trace, which is my interest. Will probably resell book."
4,Cheesey but great fun!,"This movie was shown once on the Lifetime channel in 1992 and has finally been released. It is the story of Camelot through Guinevere's eyes. Somewhat distorted - Lancelot and Guinevere meet at a Dark Ages ""New Age"" camp run by Morgan LeFay and become betrothed, Arthur ""saves"" Guinevere by marrying her and gets to take her virginity to boot, Guinevere has a baby girl. It's fun to see Noah Wyle before the ER rage swept the U.S. If anything, it's a bargain at $10. Buy it, you'll like it!"
1,Simply Awful,"The acting is very bad. The characters are completely unbelievable. The battle scene choreography is grade school theater-level and the story is uninspiring. Overall, I couldn't wait to finish it and turn it off. I didn't care what happend to the characters, they were that poorly portrayed. Don't buy this - it is a total waste of time. My copy is going into the yard sale bin."
5,Wonderful!,"Love these incense sticks! Wonderful, seductive aroma. One of the few incenses that do not give me a headache! Price was good, and shipping was very fast."
4,Very good,"I love it !, is very good material, soft, the only thing not that good about it is the video is in VHS, could be great if you change it to DVD."
2,"Great songs, lo-fidelity","This is a great collection of songs. Unfortunately, they all sound like they were recorded in Joe Hill's basement. Despite the distortion and screeching sounds on some of the tracks, I still listen to this CD quite a bit. I guess that's a testament to how good some of these tunes are."
4,Castings from India.,Item was as expected.THere was a price reduction of fifty dollars through Amazon.(As opposed to going to the dealers own site).
2,very basic,"I was looking for something more challenging. I am by no means a pilates guru but even the challenging version of this workout does not do much for me. The pace seems very rushed too. Also, I wanted to learn some new exercises but this has the same ones I've seen on Pilates for Dummies."
3,Hmmm,"It's o.k. but I didn't very much care for the womans voice. It was annoying, very annoying! I think they go maybe a little too fast but it's still do-able."
5,Covers You From The Start,"Whether you are a beginner or have some experience with Pilates and need to refresh, then advance, or looking for more workouts, this covers it all from the beginners on.The beginners sets you up well with instruction that is designed for people who are new to pilates and/or maybe are a bit more out of shape and need to work on pilates at an easier level before it moves onto other levels.Karen describes the moves and how they are modified for you on each level, or how they are adjusted to make them a bit more difficult or closer to the full moves, and then adds more.It has three levels, and there is enough to keep you going for quite awhile."
3,Language Spanish?,"Language: Spanish?When we were about to purchase this item we looked at the main features, one said language: ""Spanish"" so we finally found the famous Pilates with spanish audio. After our second baby my wife wanted to work out a little, and lose some weight in the process. Due to over promotion, those advise-givings among women, and audio spanish availability she asked me to order this dvd. However, when she received it home, suprise!! suprise!! no spanish audio, as above shown. Amazon should give more reliable information about audio languages and subtitles not only for non-english speakers but also for hard of hearings."
1,lame,I just started pilates and wanted a shorter video to add to my routine. There's a person performing the movements and then a an annoying voice off screen talking about the movements and doing counts.... just weird
4,This Pilates dvd is good,I have done both mat and reformer pilates classes. This is the first dvd I have bought for pilates. It's a good dvd. It offers a few different levels for the individual. And it offers various programs based on your level. The exercises are explained and demonstrated well. The only thing I think the dvd lacks is enthusiasm.
1,Disjointed routine,"Unlike many other routines, this one seems very disjointed. The screen goes black between each new move and there is no way of knowing if you will be sitting up, or laying down, or on your side when the screen is lit again. Disjointed routine. Buying it was a mistake, thank goodness I have other good Pilates DVDs to use. Could never recommend this one."
3,Different that other workouts,"I got this DVD so that I could get a better handle on Pilates. I have a few DVDs that I use regularly and wanted something a little more low key. I have only worked through the beginner routines and they seem a little too easy, even for uncoordinated me. I will try the intermediate level next time, in hopes of a better workout. The intstruction is easy to follow, though you do have to see the TV screen in order to follow along. My screen sits up high in the bedroom, so I had to relocate to the living room. The instructors' voice and manner of speaking is a little too much to take at times. If I could mute the volume and continue the workout, it would make me happier."
5,great tape,made my back stronger and able to bend with flexibility.My abs and tummy were flat in six weeks...love this tape and will recommend to others to try.
3,Not quite what I expected,"After reading all the rave reviews for this DVD, I decided to buy it. I wanted an at-home DVD since I already take a mat class once a week. I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed in the whole thing. I get a better workout from my mat class. The instructor goes too slow in some areas and way too fast in other parts. I keep finding myself pausing and/or skipping ahead. My mat instructor has been trained by Romana (the Pilates Queen). At this point I think I'll just stick with her routine at home without a DVD."
1,nananaThunder,"Weak have a ton of work out tapes, this is my worst yet. The setting is inside and it is not pleasing to the eye to be doing a pilates tape in this setting. The lady looks mad the whole time and never smiles. Would have been better if she did the talking and smiles at some point."
3,It's okay,"This dvd does has good pilates moves, but is little boring. The moves that the instructor proforms are good for a total body workout. Another good thing about this dvd, it has room for advancement. There is beginner, intermediate, and advance segments. But,the instructor's voice is annoying and gives annoying teaching cues. The pitch of her voice, at many parts of the workout, are high and irritating."
2,Overrated Pilates DVD,"I purchased this DVD after reading reviews about it. I own a number of Pilates DVDs and was looking forward to the versatility of this one.Bottomline - I'm dissapointed with this DVD. The voice-over is not pleasant and annoying at times . . . instructions are sometimes inconsistent . . . but, what I consider its greatest shortcoming is how poorly transitions are handled . . . and sometimes not at all. I was taught that transitions in Pilates were important and needed to be treated as smooth flowing and continuous . . . that one series led into the next . . . In this DVD, one series may end in one position and the next series starts in a completely different position. This introduces some degree of risk in making a rapid transition too quickly and inappropriately in order to keep up."
3,Did Anyone Else Get A Bad Copy??????,"I'm new to pilates, but this DVD was disappointing. For starters, on each of the lessons,and on the interview, there is no sound when the instructor speaks. You can hear the background music, and see her lips moving, but cannot hear what she is saying. Because I am new to Pilates I was disappointed, as I need the instruction. So, for the terms, and positions I am unfamiliar with, I have to look them up on the internet. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, one minute you are on the floor and the next you are on your feet, so it is quite jumpy. I would have thought these transitions would have been smoother. The sound is all there for each of the variations, so I decided to keep the DVD. Plus it is a good workout, and I am glad there are many to choose from for each level. However, I won't buy another DVD from this company, and if you really enjoy pilates, I would be willing to bet there are better DVD's out there, that have all of the sound!"
3,3 stars only,"Some of the workouts look good, but as a teacher trained in New York City authentic Pilates I know that Joseph Pilates never connected weight loss to his method of body conditioning. The real Pilates method naturally slims your muscles and makes you strong. So there's no need to claim weight loss is a benefit. The Pilates method is amazing itself."
2,"Too fast, bad transitions","I bought this DVD despite the mixed reviews and have to report that I was disappointed with the purchase. I have another Pilates tape (not DVD) that was one continuous workout which I much prefer. With this one, there was no time in between transitions and there often were no clear transitions. I also found that it went way too fast and tried to cram in too many things into each session."
2,Weight loss? The only weight I lost was in my wallet!,This is soooo slow I almost fell asleep. It is good to learn the moves of Pilates and after that get rid of it!!
3,good for teaching techniqute,This was a good dvd to for teaching the technique and specific positions. It did not transition as well. You would finish one exercise sitting and all of a sudden the next exercise would start and the instructor would be lying down...how did she get there? I think any consitent exercise and diet regime is worth the effort just keep doing the exercices you learn. I lost two sizes in 3 months.
4,"Good service, good product",Good program that allows a user to progress from the basics through the more advanced.
2,Not for beginners,"I am new to Pilates and have not worked out regularly in about 4 years. The instructor seems ""stiff"" and her voice is a little annoying. She doesn't seem to enjoy Pilates herself which makes it hard to get excited about it. Some of the excercises, in my opinion, are not for beginners at all - way too hard, and there is not easier alternative to certain excercises for less experienced i.e. less fit people. It also doesn't seem to have a progression (beginning, middle, end)... There's a short warm up but then it's on the floor, up again, sit down, roll around... The whole video and it's setting seems very dated too..."
3,Not what I expected,"I have found this video informative. However I was hoping for more of a format that would have you to feel you were in a class setting with the relaxing pilates music. As far as the purchase and delivery through Amazon, this all went smoothly and promptly."
3,New to pilates,"I have been doing yoga for about a year now and I have been wanting to try pilates. I tried this dvd based on the good reviews. Just wish we could preview them first! Her voice was a wee bit iritating to me. I'm used to the slow and controlled movements of yoga but she was way way to slow and boring. She gave no alternate methods to the movements if you are new and not super limber as she is. The movements did not flow from one to the next as she had you sitting up and lying down, sitting up and lying down. I'm just disappointed as I really wanted to try pilates. I just need to find another dvd to get me to like it! If anyone has a suggestion on a dvd that is bit more upbeat (not talking Richard Simmons upbeat!) and gives alternatives to the posititons please let me know!"
2,OMG,"This DVD is for those who are in shape. If you are overweight, obese, top or bottom heavy, just starting to work out, don't bother. This chick has you doing things with your body that you need a reasonable shape to do it with and plenty of space to roll and tumble in."
4,"Good Buy, Offers Much Value","I too was weary about the DVD after reading one review about a ""glitch"", but I didn't find that at all. For the Most part I was impressed with the incredible value offered on the DVD. Lots of programs to chose from and best of all you can select your own workout routine based on personal preferences. Frankly, I have not found those capabilities anywhere else and I have a considerable collection of weightloss products."
2,Not very Inspiring,I was not at all impressed with this DVD. I have several other Pilates DVDs and thought this would make a good addition to my collection based on the reviews here. Boy was I wrong. This was the most uninspiring workout video I've ever seen. I looks like it was taped in stoggey old mansion and the pace is very slow to the point of boring. The narration was poor at best and I can't imagine losing any weight following this slow format.
3,A Little Disappointing,"This is the first Pilates DVD or video that I have ever bought, so perhaps my expectations were unrealistic. That being said, I found the product a little disappointing -- and nowhere near as good as my pilates mat class that I take. First, Pilates isn't a good weight loss exercise, and I think the title is somewhat misleading. Secondly, I found the pace too fast in some areas. As a relative beginner, I still struggle to remember the correct positions and need time to get my body aligned as it should be. Also, once I got into position, I found that the repetitions were not enough. I was constantly putting the DVD on pause so I could do as many reps as needed. I would have appreciated more tips and comments about breathing throughout the exercise routine, as well. I will probably look for another Pilates DVD and see if it is more to my liking."
2,The cover is deceiving,"To explain: the cover gives the impression that the workout will take place in a relaxing atmosphere - if not outdoors, at least in a pleasant and modern studio. But the video appears old and it has a strange, kind of cheap-looking quality. It's filmed in a gloomy and dull room with weird lighting. For some people this might not matter, but I really don't like it and just can't get through any of the workouts. There's a LOT of talking and it feels like it takes forever to get to the actual exercises. The expert actually narrates without doing the workout (a blond woman does it without talking) and the audio is completely uneven - sometimes her voice gets really loud, especially when she's counting out the movement. It's too weird for me. It's also possible that I just don't have the patience for this kind of workout tape - too much talking, I want to just get to the point."
5,Great Value Even Better Workouts,"I cannot begin to say enough positive things about this DVD. I was familar with Pilates after taking a few classes at my local gym, but defintely more a beginner than advance. Simply put the DVD offers so much in terms of programs , time variations, and levels of difficulty. The instruction is very detailed and precise and you can see the producers went the extra mile to ensure a sfae practice. At the end of the day, I've lost about 20 pounds have tighter abs or core, all coupled with a sensible diet."
3,not so easy to follow,"I got this dvd a while ago but have just started to use it. I have been doing pilates for about a year now using other tapes and although this dvd has very good information about proper form etc., in general it is not easy to follow. The presenter jumps from one position to another sometimes with with very little warning. It is very difficult to follow the dvd and do the exercises at the same time as she sometimes really elaborates each position. Also I have noticed that for some of the exercises she only shows you one side of the body and not the other, so I guess you must pause the tape and do the the other side on your own. In general this is an OK dvd to own to freshen up on form and posture but it is not so great for daily exercise."
2,The disc has technical flaws.,"The CD is recorded from cassette tapes. It gives a warning on the back of the CD of this fact (it should give it in the description on Amazon). However, it's not just tape hiss - on about half of the CD the tape had been damaged to the point where there are pops so it's practically unenjoyable. I would only suggest this CD for fans who are already have everything else."
4,comprehensive collection of Black Uhuru's historic past,"This album combined the more jazzy sounds of Don Carlos with the rough but powerful lead of Micheal Rose. For those listeners that like a mix of Black Uhuru's spectacular history, this is the album for you. The re-mastering could have been done better but overall great album."
2,A real sleeper,"The picture quality was great. To bad the movie went down from there. Writing was a little weak and boring. A lot of sides and rear shots. There was plenty of times it could have been interesting, but it never happen. If you have nothing else to watch, it might be good."
3,Expectations Not Met - Novel Too Juvenile,"Everything in this novel is too simplistically told - the greenhouse cliff that could be avoided by a conversion within 10 years to all fusion engines, to Dan Randolph who double dammed and said rain don't make applesauce too many times for me. The characters of Fletcher and George were better drawn.Give me Bova's Mars book."
2,"Less science, more political","For those who like space opera, this will be a bit of a disappointment. The first two installments of the Grand Tour opus have remarkably little science, and instead focus much more on political machinations in a world dominated by the USSR (Privateers) and then by a a global economic organization which seems to be the target of organized crime. Throw in a bit of sex, some greenhouse issues (explained in a very elementary way), and you have quick, light reading. Suitable for a beach or subway ride, perhaps an airplane trip? But not Bova at his best."
4,Decent Science Fiction,Not great but an easy reader and helpful to relax after reading something deeper. I wasn't disappointed and it adds to the themes Bova has presented without requiring one read those that came before. The characters appear before and after novels but unlike others yo don't need to read them to enjoy this one. Decent Character development of the good guys but not so good with the bad guys. Good explanation of the possible results of global warming without beating it to death.
5,"A fine, early screenplay by Preston Sturges!","Jean Arthur, Edward Arnold, a baby Ray Milland, and the beginnings of what became known as the Sturges Players combine for a tight little screwball comedy. This was not available on video until just recently, but if you enjoy the old madcap comedies, ala MY MAN GODFREY, NOTHING SACRED, and Preston Sturges romps like PALM BEACH STORY, THE LADY EVE, etc, I'm confident in recommending EASY LIVING. I didn't notice Sturges wrote it until the final credits, but that didn't alter my feelings. This is an under-appreciated jewel!"
4,Easing Living,"Fun movie - enjoyed it greatly. What a fun way to spend a weekend morning, listening / seeing an older movie that was just a delightful escape. Glad I purchase it!"
4,cheesy action but fun,"I forgot about this film until recently. I'm a John Carpenter fan, and this film goes along the path of Escape from New York and Big Trouble In LIttle China. Aside from some fashion and music moments, this film is somewhat timeless, especially with today's headlines involving the government and unemployment. Rod Piper is great in this role, and surprised he did not follow up with more roles along this genre. Some cheesy lines, but they are memorable and good fight/action scenes. Keith David is also great in his role. Enjoy this for some cheesy action but still entertaining and fun."
5,An excellent movie once you get past its trappings.,"They Live is an excellent movie on several levels after you break through the trappings of looking at it as just what is shown, and see the larger picture. It is a fun movie to watch. Not being terribly long, it gets to its point fairly directly, and it does not hem and haw around with multiple subplots that do not matter to the end point of the movie. On another level, it has several elements to it that make it ""serious"". It makes a statement that humans have the potential to live not in reality, but in an artificial reality created by others. The statement ""When you get more than two humans together in one place, the average IQ of the group drops by one point for each person after two"" applies--just imagine every human together, sleeping away in blissful ignorance of the fact they are just livestock. As Charles Fort said, ""The Earth is a farm. We are someone else's property."""
4,Classic Cult..,"They Live is a sci-fi movie about aliens trying to take over the world and colonizing it through the media. It starts slow but when Piper's character finds a pair of special sunglasses that allows him to see the reality of society, that's when the fun starts and never lets up. The story is excellent and the script reflects well with some of the best one-liners ..""I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass, and I'm all out of bubblegum"". The ending though is abrupt and makes little sense and the cast is more or less forgettable with the exception of Roddy Piper and Keith David who give great performances. They stage one of the longest, and best fight scene in movie history. Overall, an enjoyable 80's sci-fi flick that really gets you laughing. They Live is one of Carpenter's best films definitely a must see for everyone!"
2,This is John Carpenter?,"I guess I thought it would be better. The aliens are laughable, the plot is silly, and the whole thing looks cheap. The little injections of topical humor are occassionally witty but that's about it. How is one supposed to obey commands to both ""sleep"" and ""marry and reproduce""? Oh wait, maybe that's humor, too. It creeped out my 11 year old daughter, and I guess that about the level it works on."
1,WARNING THIS DVD IS CENSORED!!!!!!!,They Live is an awesome movie if you can find the UNCUT edition....they made scenes when they look throught the glasses black and white...THEY WERE COLOR ON THE OLD VHS RELEASE!!!! Also the HEAD EXPLOSION scene is MISSING. Whats wrong with people why do they feel the need to censor movie.....If you like censored movies then this is the censored edition!
3,"Good Movie, Lame DVD","This film is better than I remembered it being. Interesting premise that holds up pretty well even today. Roddy Piper cannot act, but that's okay, he does alright with what he's given. Not bad. The DVD is weak, no extras at all. A commentary track would have been great. For the cheap price, definitely reccommended."
4,"Fun, Underrated Flick!","Of all the horro/sc-fi films of the past 25 years, this one ranks as one of my favorite. It is an underrated, funny, action packed film, and it is one of Carpenter's best. The story revolves around an unnamed character in the not too distant future [Rodney Piper]. He is a low paid construction worker, who one day puts on a pair of sunglasses and discovers a world of aliens around him, and the aliens discover him too.This film has alot of great lines [ 'You look like you fell in cheesedip back in 1957'], and hidious alien makeup that makes for a fun moie, with some suspense and the infamous fight scene that goes on for 5 or 6 minutes on end. This is an underrated, 50's style B movie that is very entertaining."
5,They live is one of the best movies from the 80's!,"This is the best of all of John Carpenters early flicks. The best part in the entire movie is where Piper first puts on the glasses and sees the wealthy alien buying the newspaper. He looks like he saw a ghost. The whole idea about the subliminal messages was cool. The best message was on the money "" THIS IS YOUR GOD ."" Another good part in the movie is when they go in the TV station and start destroying the aliens. A must have for any SCI-FI or John Carpenter fan!"
4,mad buggin!,"I saw this movie whilst tripping out on some crazy mushrooms. It blew my f***ing mind! Aside from the silliness of having the lead actor a pro-wrestling star, the concept of this movie is beautiful. The sunglasses-thing was mad cheesy, but the idea about the aliens integrated into everyday society was awesome. The part that really won me over was that once he had the sunglasses on, billboards would no longer read what they originally said, but instead commands from the aliens. The epitomy of this was the dollar bill that read ""This Is Your God"", also the music was mad freaky as was the whole thing with the bums and the tv static. Good cult flick, albeit 80's inspired cheesiness knocks off a star."
3,I'd call it a sleeper hit... it'll make you think.,"A great ""us against them"" movie. The alien discovery scenes are great and nothing can touch the ""classic"" 15 minute long fight scene. After all, it's Roudy Roddy Piper. To me, it echoes back to the classic Red Scare commies-are-among-us movies of the 50's and 60's."
4,Searing documentary about the Bush Administration?,"An in-depth, unvarnished look at the inner workings of Bush, Cheney and the rest of the gang. If only we all really had the special sunglasses! So for now we only get to see the Bush administration portrayed by actors, some with great alien make-up! The movie is sly, cool and sooo interesting. Roddy Piper is perfectly cast as a drifter, who inadvertently discovers aliens and their massive propaganda campaign against us. And it's so true to life it's almost non-fiction! This is also a fun flick that never gets boring, even after multiple viewings. The premise is so simple that it's cunning. This one's a keeper. And I think they sell the sunglasses at the 99 cent store! You are getting sleepy... repeat after me... Shop now... Disregard the Bill of Rights, the Constitution... Obey... Buy this movie... NOW."
5,motivating,"this movie is a classic and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire movie. has such popular lines as ""I am here to chew bubble gum and kick 'a' unfourtunatly, i am all out of bubble gum"" i highly recommend this to everyone who loves excellent, 70's style sci-fi. I am particularly fond of the music. i wish that there was a sound track.RYAN"
4,Carpenter-esque,"John Carpenter hits home with another conceptual ""makes ya think"" movie. As always, the excellent supporting soundtrack by Carpenter enhances the gloomy mood of the picture (see Prince of Darkness, Escape From New York, etc. for the same effect). This is a highly enjoyable movie one can get involved in. Roddy Piper is perfectly cast. Where's my sunglasses and bubblegum? See it."
5,Great seller,Bought 2 of these. Shipped right away and received in brand new condition. Will continue using this seller. AAA+++
5,Simply Awesome.,"John Carpenter shows his amazing creativity once again. From the creator of the greatest horror film ever made ""Halloween"" comes They Live. This movie is awesome, it shows society and culture as what it really is with the help of special glasses, it also shows who is human and who is alien. The way they show the world through the glasses is how I see the world anyhow minus the aliens, so I related to this film very well. The story is awesome, the effects are awesome, the aliens look great and the actors are perfect. Roddy Piper is actually a really good actor and made this movie great.Simply awesome movie from John Carpenter."
3,Where's The Special Edition???,"I'm really disappointed that despite England getting a fully loaded DVD of ""They Live"" complete with commentary and a making of featurette, Region 1 fans get stuck with a bare bones editon of this cult favorite. This seems to happen a fair amount and really now, shouldn't US customers get the same special editions that other countries get, especially when they're American films? I'd save your money unless you really want the disc (which probably is a better transfer than the old out-of-print DVD if nothing else) and wait for Universal to put out a better package. C'mon Universal, you can do better. Don't skimp on the extras when it comes to putting out your catalog titles."
3,"Good Concept, bad execution","Granted, this is an old movie but even based on the technology at the time it could have been much better in the conceptual elements and visuals. A pair of cheap sunglasses did not do it for me. They should have found some other element there."
2,Great... for an hour episode on TV,"This movie has one gimmick that would make a great hour long episode of ""The Twilight Zone""... but it's not enough for an entire film. The time is padded out with things like the unending and boring fistfight that comes across like some weird gay fight club fetish.... or something."
3,Could have been so much better,"I hated giving this movie only 3 stars, but lets be honest it's not for everyone. The story drags, I think I could have done better special effects, the 30 minute fist fight is enough to make anyone comatose, and the acting is some of the worst you will ever see. BUT, the concept was great. It has a powerful political message. I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I do like this movie. If you liked Fahrenheit 451, 1984, or THX1138, you might be able to stomach this one."
3,need help,I need to be contacted about returning this item. I'm afraid it's broken inside the unopened container. Please advise. cindy@dumptrucks.com
2,"Great movie, no extras","The movie I give four stars, the extras get zero.Until they do justice to this film and have a director's comentary and other features I will pass on it."
4,They Live,"This is a great movie that should not have been placed out of DVD print. The action is unbelievable and the story is very original. Aliens basically come and blend in with us but set up a transmitter that makes everyone see them as regular people. Well a group of underground resistant figures them out and although they mean no harm they want to expose them. The ending is fantastic and i would recommend the VHS if you really want it. I would rank this in my Top 10 of "" B-movies "" ! Roddy Piper reals takes it to them !"
3,"Good movie for its time . Action , suspence, comedy","Besides some bad acting i really enjoyed the movie, it was funny with action and has an interesting concept that rings true to some Extent to our society today."
5,Action Rules In This Movie!,With this movie John Carpenter struck paydirt again. One of themost colorful wrestlers in the world Roddy Piper plays the role of the hero in this film. He goes to Los Angeles seeking to findemployment.He is given a pair of specially made sunglasses by aresistance group. He is able to see that many important leaders are acyually aliens.They are ugly bug eyed alien type creatures. Without the glasses these hideous creatures look normal.Also with these sunglasses you are able to see secret messages written on billboards. Piper goes into a war with these aliens.There is one gun battle after the other between Piper and these creatures.The ending of the movie is also unique. Buy this movie.It is good.
4,Good enertainment; a a message about the Reagan era,"Film work on several levels; funny, scary, and a political commentary of the times."
3,*Just Okay!*,This movie was just okay to me.Nothing to exciting.I guess you just have to be into these type of movies.
2,Awesome! One of Carpenter's best!,"I love this movie and it's one of my favorite John Carpenter films. One of the best scenes is the fight scene with Roddy Piper and Keith David and I was disappointed about the dvd because there's no special features, not even a trailer. At least,The picture and sound are good. If anybody's a fan of Carpenter as I am, this is the movie to own."
5,A Movie For Real Men...My Ultimate Favorite!,"It has everything a guy could ask for in a movie. Some of the best one liners ever to hit the big screen are in this movie. Rowdy Roddy Piper kicks @$$ and takes names in this for only man movie. I have seen this movie more times than I can remember and have yet got sick of it. My wife absolutely hates it and can't understand my connection to this film. Easy...testosterone! So, if your manly enough, put this disk in and step back onto the couch. Enjoy! If this movie is up your alley, check out Escape from New York!"
4,A vision like no others,John Carpenter explicates his theory on where yuppies and corporate culture come from. If you hate this movie you must be a College Republican.
4,Roddy can act.. and what a fight seen!,Carpenter does a great job with this film. It really makes you think about how it was back in the 80's. People just trying to scrap up any money they could while coorporate America is falling apart! Businesses going out of business left and right and people losing jobs by the second. But wait... there are aliens in our mist. It would seem that an alien species in taking over our planet and we can't see them without special glasses. Let me tell you that Roddy Piper does a very good job acting in this. He had no experience in any feature film before (Unless you call WWF REALLY acting! ) And that fight seen with Keith David is worth the price of the DVD alone. If there is any problem it is that there are no extras on this DVD. Sound are picture quality are decent but the best you find on anything that is out there. This movie is a cult-classic so buy it... you won't be disappointed!
2,Great Set-up! So-so script!,"It takes abourt 45 minutes to lay out one of the more intriguing premises of a film, and then the final 45 minutes to knock it down with a weak shoot-em-up plot that doesn't ring true at all. Good acting by Roddy Piper (surprise, surprise) and Keith David. My fave line: ""I am here to chew bubblegum and kick ass... and I'm all outta bubblegum!"""
3,How is it possible?,"How is it possible to release this movie in a ""deluxe collector's edition"" without a free pair of sunglasses? It's a crying shame I tell you!"
2,great movie. bad disc,the blu ray has glitches in it where the screen blacks out and either the machine stops recognizing the disc or it stays black for several moments and eventually returns to where you left off
5,Great fun!,"Well, I don't know about all the social, political, or artistic ideas here, and I was never a Rowdy Roddy Piper devotee. I just view this as a campy B movie that's not just so bad that it's good, it's so bad that it's absolutely excellent. Reminds of something you'd see in the pre-cable days on Chiller Theatre about 3 in the morning. Wonderfully over-the-top and highly recommended."
4,$ = THIS IS YOUR GOD,"Outstanding b-movie cult classic that takes on a-list subject matter: materialism and mindless consumption. Roddy Rod Piper proves himself to actually be a very competent, artful actor. Not a big surprise since he was a WWF favorite. The fight scene between him and Keith David is one of my favorite film fights ever - and the reason behind the fight is hilarious.This might not be the best sci-fi movie ever made, and our economic/class separation reality isn't quite as harsh as portrayed by the movie, but sometimes to critique something you have to exaggerate it a bit. ""They Live"" will never let you look at a billboard, magazine, or dollar bill the same way again. Like other Carpenter movies, this is a great example of how a cool story can be made without a bazillion-dollar budget.-- JJ Timmins"
4,they live,"great campy movie, if your looking for Oscar performance don't look here, but if you want an entertaining movie this could be it"
5,Solid release,A classic that finally gets a decent release. Good commentary. Picture looks great and authentic to the period. No complaints here.
4,great movie in that terrible sort of way,"This movie is great and bad in the right ways. And, one of the longest fight scences in a movie."
4,One of Carpenter's Best !,"First of all, I would have given this a full 5 stars but the lack of extra prevented me to do so. Hey, the menu screen only have play and scene selection, my goodness. If John Carpenter shows little respect for his own fine work by providing a commentary along with star Roddy Piper, I bet this DVD will be flying off the shelvesFor those who are not aware of the plot of the movie, here is a basic summary, the world apparently has been invaded and controlled by ""aliens"" and they are among us as Politicians, sales, lawyers, cops, etc. They can only be seen by someone wearing special sunglass. To say more will spoil the fun.The sound is Dolby 2.0 and it is not bad, and the picture transfer is fine. If somebody at Universal decide to release a special edition with load of extra, we are sure to buy it again. Highly recommended."
4,It may be a B movie... but does it have some truth to it?,"I enjoyed this movie, which is much like ""The Matrix"" where people are living in a reality or conciousness created by an outside force. I find this very intriguing. It gets better if you read the conspiracy books by David Icke, who states explicitly that our rulers are just aliens or alien hybrids that took over the Earth in ancient times and have been running the show since then.If you buy into this or not, the movie is semi-entertaining, but is not for those who get spooked really easily because the thought of these ugly aliens being your next door neighbors is very creepy.This movie does raise some issues of why humanity is so easily controlled and where humanity might end up if people don't wake up to the fact that they are being controlled by forces that are not easily understood. Already we are going into a ""New World Order"" and our rights are slowly being taken away due to recent events. Let's see where it all goes."
2,"Cute, but","These are a good value, as far as you get many tools and a cute container for them, but I was rather disappointed with the quality. Like other reviewers mentioned, the name smears off the handles rather quickly, and the pale pink color picks up stains extremely easily- not only with tomato sauce, but also stuffing, soup, and anything with curry in it. These tools, while pretty, are simply not up to the same standards as other kitchenaid products."
2,Pretty in Pink but stains easily,"I really liked a rich pink color when I bought these spatulas and spoons, but they stained the first time I cooked curry or tomato sause. I tried everything to remove the stains, but nothing seems to work. So what used to be pretty pink is now yellow and not so pretty. I am surprised the manufacturer didn't think about this ""small"" detail, when stirring sauces is what spatulas are frequently used for. You would be better off buying black spatulas. At least they always look like new."
2,Nice tools but poor quality,I love my pink tools. The only thing is that the name on the handle has dissapeared?? I made spagetti and the spoon got stained with tomatoe sauce. That is why I am very dissapointed
4,Excellent,A very good dvd to help your child wind down at the end of the day. Beautiful songs and heps reminds kids about being polite and brushing teeth...
4,Bear Rocks,"As always bear keeps kids busy and teaches them at the same time. This one is excellent to help get them ready for bed too. Bear is great, he teaches about import things such as brushing teach, combing hair, potty training, the seasons, colors, to share, doctor office visiting, among many other things. The best pre-school has to offer."
2,"Sorry, my son found it boring","My son loves Barney and Little People and would watch those for hours if I would let him (no way). I bought this DVD because I wanted to encourage him with tooth brushing and bed habits with a fun video. And, it took Bear and all of his friends...what seemed to be an hour of video...to get to bed! I was bored to tears. My toddler didn't last very long at all. The bed habits, which seemed more like ""how much can I stall before I go to bed"" or procrastinate, were not exactly what I wanted my son to learn. I just did not like this video at all. Sorry.We also bought the Bear Dance Party Video. My son DOES like that one. To each their own, I guess!"
2,Not up par.,Would not recommend this book. It's trite and slow moving. Definitly not up to the Delinsky standard. Most of the time I will buy her books just because her name is on the cover. Wasted my money this time.
1,Review of 'Impulse',"Normally, I enjoy Catherine Coulter's books very much - up until I read this book I believed I could buy any of her books without being concerned about if I would like it. Unfortunately, this book did not live up to her prior novels.The plot line was imaginative and should have been exciting - I am usually unable to put one of her books down and I finish it in a couple of days - this book took me more than two weeks to get through. The characters were flat and even by the end of the book I really didn't care what happened to them. Definitely not the reaction she was going for during the final chapters!Overall, I would have to say that I really did not like this book. My recommendation would be to purchase any one of her other novels."
2,had to force myself to finish,This is the first book I've read by this author and I honestly don't know if I will try another.This book was lacking in a lot of ways. I didn't find the relationship between the two main characters engaging at all and by the end of the book I found I didn't care at all what happened to any of them....
3,Not As Good As I Expected,"Always heard that Catherine Coulter was a good author. First book by her that I've read. Book leaves a lot to be desired in more ways than one. Not very action-packed and at points unrealistic. Didn't mind the sex just wish there was a reason for some of it. Felt the relationship between the female lead and her ""father"" wasn't explained and developed fully. This was just an ok book."
1,Wish I Ignored this Impulse,"While I have to admit the plot is more than interesting, everything else [stunk]. There are too many things that bothered me about this. First of all, when did the hero and heroine decide they loved each other; when he took her on the lawn or when he took her in the pool knowing what others would think when they found her panties? I understand the bad men being so aweful, but if he is supposed to be the good guy, how could he treat her just like they do? What the hell does she see in him anyways, ever? So what, he is great in bed. I guess it's up to us to assume they had qualities worth loving other than sex. Second, when and how did Rafeal's mother and Cocoa meet? How did they correspond without Mr. Meannie finding out? I don't think that was ever mentioned. I feel like I never got to know the characters, except for a little bit of history. This thing only deserves one star because the plot was good and interesting. Other than that, I didn't like it."
3,Too much sex,"This book was alright. It showed how mind numbingly ignorant the criminal element can be. Everyone dressed in white Armani with light blue shirts. UGH.There was way too much sex in this book, it would have been half as long without it. She does a much better book when she leaves all the sex detail out of it.Coulter is a great crime novel writer, she needs to stick with that and leave the porn to someone else."
1,Too much violence against women.,"I've enjoyed many of Catherine Coulter's books, but this is not one of them. This book was filled with chapter after chapter of debasing thoughts of chauvinistic men. The whole story seemed to revolve around how many times you can insult and humiliate the women, including the heroine."
1,Needs an articulate author or editor,"I picked this book up at an airport never having read Coulter before. Her descriptions are unimaginative and repetitive. What could have been a great story is dulled by the flat characters, boring dialog and inconsistent pace."
5,"Easy Recipes, Complex Flavors",We love their restaurants and really love this book! The recipes are easy to follow and most are quite quick to make yet are complex in flavor. We particularly like their comments before each recipe that summarize the dish and make recommendations of other dishes that complement the flavors.
2,"Good product, but incomplete",As others have stated this item did not come with the wall mount.Please contact me directly to arrange for the shipment of the back plate.
1,did not come with mounts,"Just as previously stated by another reviewer, these display cases did not come with mounts. I am on the phone with Amazon now getting this fixed, however it should not have happened in the first place."
4,HEPA filter,"Perfectly acceptable and much less expensive than original part. All paper, and less solid frame than plastic frame of original, but who cares. It's just a replaceable filter, and no need to be built like a tank."
2,Leon Jay Seminar Series Vol. 2,"The visual aspect of this video is very good. Leon Jay is a gifted teacher and demonstrates the techniques in clear detail. However, the sound quality is terrible! It is a live seminar, the dialog volume is extremely weak, and in many places during the demonstrations it is impossible to hear what he is saying. This is unfortunate because one cannot learn the small circle system without knowing which direction to apply pressure. While the techniques are demonstrated visually, many aspects of the small circle movements are imperceptable to the eye and must be explained in order to be understood. For a 40 minute video to be priced at $30.00 a person should receive a high-end product. This video does not make the grade, and as a result, I will be returning it in short order."
3,Master the Basics -- Englisht,"My ESL student owns this book and together we have looked it over, along with several others as we developed our study program. It is certainly very good, but it lacks a few elements that would enhance its usefulness. However, I like it enough to buy it and rate it three stars out of five. After I purchase the book and use it for a few weeks, I will revise my review."
4,Fantastic stuff,"A great band, doing great tunes. You won't go wrong with this CD. ""Here's That Rainy Day"" sneaks up and knocks your socks off. My only gripe is that the CD is missing the tune ""Terry Talk"" which was on the original double LP. The Politically Correct are behind this I fear."
3,Nice memories,Enjoyed the movie in the past. Not up to date but got us through hurricane sandy. I still enjoyed it.
2,uninteresting,not my type of magazine. Too upscale and ads were for things well out of my price range. but for 5.00 its something to breeze through looking at. certainly not a magazine i look forward to coming in the mail(unlike my Garden and Gun magazine which I loooovvvveee)
4,Good Quality,This magazine is of the finest quality and is very enjoyable. I appreciate thevery quick service from Amazon in getting this magazine to me. Thanks.
4,A Monthly Luxury,Town & Country has built their reputation up since 1846 and they continue to deliver a beautiful presentation of the luxurious world around us.
1,A Lost Lamb,"The magazine has gone down hill. The Editor in Chief has changed several times, the format has lost it's zip.The December cover was sad. It now is a cross between InStyle, a poor man's Vanity Fair and Ladies Home Journal.Don't subscribe they have ruined the 'brand', what made it unique. It clearly is not going to make it in the future.Sad."
1,Quite a bore...,"I received this subscription as a trial, and found it one of the most boring publications that I have ever read. By the last few issues that I got, I wasn't even looking at the pictures anymore. There are drawn-out descriptions of their views of the finer things in life, which were very materialistic. At the end of every issue there were pictures of ""real-life"" wedding announcements. Perhaps this is fitting for your local newspaper, but it struck me as out of place in a magazine."
1,Town and country,Being a first man seeing this magazine up to this timeI`d like to say I want to read this magazine whatever new or old one after I have a chance.Because I `d like to write some manuscripts on Chinese culture for this magazine.
2,If you want to pretend,"That you are super rich than this is the magazine for you. Even if you are super rich and you need inspiration, this is the magazine for you. If you are not super rich, and the reality of that being rubbed in your face monthly doesn't appeal to you, then I advise you do not subscribe. Read it in the Dr.'s office instead and save what little money you do have."
2,"Good articles, too much advertising","The Town & Country magazine contains an article or two that provide good reading.Otherwise; the magazine contains more advertisements than anything. One reason I will probably not renew once the subscription expires, unless this were to change."
5,Avoid the Temptation to Presume Elitism !,"OK it's pretty easy to presume this magazine has little appeal for the average person when the advertising focus is on $$$$ handbags and $$$$$ jewelry. But when you look at the long publishing history of Town and Country, you realize that it's not only the rich and famous that are reading it. There are simply not that many of the elite to keep this mag going. So what's in it for the average Jane? First, the writing is excellent. Reviews on anything from books, cosmetics to shoes are specific and dependable. Additionally it's written to ADULTS without an unwelcome emphasis on which starlet of the minute is going to crash next. Finally--and just for fun--the horoscope column is one of the best in any of the women's magazines out there. So dabble your toes in the inflatible kiddie pool in the back yard, add a sprig of fresh mint to your plastic tumbler of ice tea and let your imagination roam free,"
4,A pleasant read,"I've not seen the most recent issues, so perhaps there is more advertising than there used to be. However, I like T&C. It has a touch of class, and it is aimed at adults, not kids, adults who ""have arrived,"" as the saying goes. Money is not the key to ""arriving;"" self assurance, knowledge, and capability are. This magazine gives me ideas. I can't buy the things in it, but I can try new combinations of what I do own, use old things in new ways and experiment. I get an idea of what is in fashion in case I need to look au courant for some occasion. T&C is a tool in the same way Vogue or another fashion magazine is. I believe that it isn't necesary to be wealthy in order to look like a million. I also have my own personal saying that I'm never really in fashion, but I always have style - - my own style."
4,Always interesting and a classic,"This is one of the few magazines that provides genuinely interesting, varied and useful information to people who enjoy a ""financially comfortable"" lifestyle.They cover a wide range of topics, and are known for photos from recent charity events, debutante balls, and notable weddings.From designer fashions to collecting art to their regular lists of best charities, best doctors, and best places to visit, this is a reliable magazine. It eschews fads and focuses on getting true value from everyday life.This is not a magazine for everyone, but it's greatly appreciated by its regular readers. I've read almost every issue since I was 14 years old, and... well, that's a long time. If I could read only one magazine each month, this would probably be it."
1,Where are the articles???,"AWFUL!!! This is just page after page after page of ads for grotesque jewelry - mostly gaudy watches and necklace sets - and clothing. There were two ""articles"" at the very end of the magazine, and they were awful. One, on Christmas in the English countryside, should have been beautiful. Instead, it contained just a few pics and very little text. What a disappointment.Don't waste your money. First pick up a copy in the supermarket before you waste money on a subscription. Once you see how really ridiculous this magazine full of nothing but ads really is, you won't waste your money on a subscription."
1,boring,"Years ago, Town and Country was an interesting magazine.....NOT SO ANYMORE. Don't waste even the small amount of money Amazon charges."
1,Simply Gauche,"Wow! What an incredible disappointment. I have subscribed to this magazine in years past and it is evident that any and all staff who had a shred of good taste have left the publication. It is lacking all grace and good taste. Just one example of the most recent cover/article, ""Naughty, Not Nice; A Gallery of Ill-Gotten Gains, Shamful Fortunes, and Greedy Grinches"" """"It may be the season of giving, but since the begining of time the takers of the world-the hustlers, the cheats, etc,-hae shown that being a grinch, and getting away with it, has its rewards. So sad. Won't be renewing this one!"
2,Nothing appealing at all,"I somehow got this subscription for free and it's worth every penny. It is so pretentious it's ridiculous. The subtitle of the magazine should be ""The advertising bible for extremely overpriced products."" The articles are nothing more than endorsements; not a hint of criticism, critique or bad words to be found. When they attempt to write an article from a ""common folk"" perspective, it is obvious. The subject matter is pure fluff and fantasy and serves nothing more than a backdrop for the ads."
2,mag,Lousy magazine; way too many adds; did not renew & will not ever get again. There are much better reads out there!
5,The New Updated T&C,"I love the changes T&C has made. It is more colorful, has more in-depth stories, and is livelier than it used to be. If you haven't read this mag in over a year, it is time to take another look."
1,NEVER RECEIVED!!!!,"I ordered this magazine for my mother-in-law at a good price; however, she still hasn't received it. I ordered it about two months ago. Good luck if you order."
2,Disapointed in Video,"This video has a good step workout if that's what you're looking for. However, I don't even know why they bother putting Shannon Miller in the title or on the cover because she has almost no part in the workout. All she does is give you a few pointers like ""Be sure you drink enough water"" throughout the video. Also, the workout is a step workout throughout the entire 45 minutes. Be sure to consider all of this before you by the video."
2,"been there, done that","This is perhaps the best written of all the Jim Morrison bio's. Davis' prose is truly a pleasure to read. But unfortunately, the fun stops there. Almost every quote that he uses is lifted from other source material. On top of that, despite the odd new nugget on Morrison, everything here has been covered already. I had hoped Davis would bring new perspectives on Jim from people who hadn't already been in all the other bios; or at least hadn't been focused on much in other bios. ""Life, Death, Legend"" just throws the other books into a blender and puts a new cover on the amalgamation."
3,"My First Doors Book, Not My Last","This was the first book I've read on Morrison. It was very interesting and well written but the lack of footnotes bothered me. I'm always curious to see where a particular anecdote in a biography comes from and with this book there's no way of knowing. It seems to me that Davis just rehashed a lot of what had been previously published before him. A good read, but I still don't know any more about Morrison that I didn't know before."
4,Very insightful and interesting.,"If you're looking for an in depth book about the life of Jim Morrison, you've found it."
5,"something new, something good, something different","i found this book to be quite informative. i've read many other biographies of Morrison's, including(unfortunately) 'No One Here Gets Out Alive,' otherwise referred to as 'Nothing Here but Lies.' I certainly find most of his research to be as close as one can get with a 'middle man.'However as with all such topics, his most outlandish claims should be taken with a large grain of salt, or at least weighed heavily. Jim's real days will never be truly known in every intimate detail; but thus far, this is as good as it gets."
2,Anticipation exceeds realization,"Awaited over 6 months for this book to be published and was let down almost immediately. Almost all but 2 pictures have been published before and the story itself has already been covered by previous bios. Still, it's an ok read for the uninitiated, but for those who have read other Morrison bios, there is nothing new covered here--except maybe that the surviving Doors were not the best friends with Morrison that they now make themselves out to be. One glaring error was the author has Morrison arriving in Paris in June '71 when in fact he had been living there since March. Would've loved new info from post-Miami to July '71 and would've loved to have seen rare photos from that time."
2,Tiresome,"Basically, this book is a compilation of Jim Morrison's drunk, drugged, and violence-prone episodes that become repetitious and tiring. Jim Morrison the artist and human being gets lost in the mayhem. The author touches on Jim's music and poetry rather lightly, and for anyone interested in a serious examination of Jim the man and his work in music and poetry, I would go and read elsewhere."
4,It's worth reading.,"Unlike the other reviewers, I liked this book. I have read many biographies about Jim, and in this one I learned a few things that I had not read (or heard) before. Of course there were a lot of rehashed stories, but to only include previously unknown facts would turn the book into a pamphlet. The author stated which stories were substantiated and which were not. It's too bad the Doors' lawyer Max Fink didn't write a book. That man knew a lot about Jim."
1,Barely worth one star,"I have read many, many books about Jim and did not like this one at all. Thankfully I bought it used and did not spend much money on it. I would not recommend this book for any fan of Jim's. There are several others way better than this junk."
4,interesting,i could not put this book down...i also have a thing for the doors and jim morrison...what an incredible person..this book takes you through his life with detail. loved it
1,An insult to Morrison and his fans,"Stephen Davis seems to have done his research in gossipy internet chat rooms and other places where old rumors are kicked around for years, the more scandalous the better. Davis has simply taken a lot of really old stories from previously published sources, thrown in a couple of interviews with people no one's ever heard of before, and is presenting it as new revelation. It's not. This is just the same old silly stories packaged up between fancy new covers. Fans won't learn anything about the real Morrison or what really happened to him. All they'll get is a lot of reheated gossip that wasn't worth the paper it was written on the first time it was published -- or the second, or the third, or the... Fans who really want to know Morrison should read his poetry, or read Frank Lisciandro's ""Feast of Friends"" or Patricia Butler's ""Angels Dance and Angels Die"" for a look at the real Jim Morrison."
3,Pretty good...,"This is an informative, albeit fairly unoriginal biography by Mr. Stephen Davis. A good, pretty easy read that any Doors fan would probably enjoy. Amazon is giving you an excellent deal, so why not?"
2,NEGATIVE!!,"This is not a good book about Jim Morrison. Throughout the book, the author expresses very negative views on Jim, his work and his personal life.His sources are not reliable.He does not write in a way that makes the reader eager to see what the next page brings."
4,Creativity for everyone,"I ordered this because I am a youth worker and mother of two teenagers, but after reading it, I want every teaching I am in to be as alive as Mark Miller proposes. It is not about some desperate attempt to reach the next generation. It is about putting creativity in the church where it should be and that applies to all ages. Miller does a wonderful job of helping his readers make a discovery, instead of just handing them to a conclusion. He has great personal examples as well as input from other experts from whom he has learned. It is an enjoyable and inspiring read!"
4,Some good ideas on rethinking public speaking,"This book has been great at getting me to rethink how to prepare talks and add stories to the mix. I wish there had been some more practical examples based on specific bible passages or examples which can be used within a specific talk.That being said, the book has really gotten me to rethink the bible stories and figure out how to make them feel real to people. How to get a group of teens or adults to experience that they are a part of the story.The example that continues to stay on my mind is bringing teens together to re-enact the Jesus story by blindfolding everyone for an entire evening until they find a Jesus character who saves them."
3,It's Alright...,"I thought that it was a good book with good ideas, although the ideas could often be harder to implement than the book lets on. The biggest problem with the book is that the author could have developed his ideas a little better."
5,This is the BEST,I too am from NY and this is by far the best brand on the market. I wish they sold it locally here in NC. I miss just being able to buy it at the grocery store. You get a lot for the money too. it's a BIG jar not those itty bitty ones they sell here at the market. You get Quality and Quantity! BEST buy!
5,Why I like Dai-Day?,"There are other duck sauces out there, but only Dai-Day tastes like the original duck sauce from the Chinese restaurants in New York where I grew up."
2,not very good,"this video is, well kinda boring. Kurt angle was way overpushed during this year and its not because hes a great athlete. get chris jericho break down the walls its alot better."
4,Decent All-around Package,"Kurt Angle has really lived up to the hype put upon him by critics and others in the WWF. I can't think of one superstar aside from the Undertaker who rocketed to getting the world title in such a short amount of time (roughly a year for both men). Combine that with Kurt's fantastic personality, ability to put on a good match, and he's an excellent all-around wrestler. This video is a nice little item that covers most of his career up to this point, and it's recommended for Kurt Angle fans or anyone interested in seeing some good wrestling matches. Once again, another great WWF video product."
2,Kurt Angle It's True It's True,"This tape is good, but there are not the DVD version,no extra. This tape tell you about Kurt Angle.You willlook clips and interviews from his match. There are matches aren't clips. This tape will tell you his won like hewin WWE(WWF)Intercontinental from Jericho Raw Is War, likehis early matches with Steve Blackman, Survivor Series 1999to King Of The Ring 2000 with interviews he defeatedRikishi, and Europan Champion, and of course finallyhe win the title from The Rock at No Mercy 2000. Don'tbuy this video, please wait, maybe there is the DVDVersion. And Chris Jericho Break Down The Walls don'tbuy maybe there is DVD version with many extras.Fine"
5,A superb introduction to Bach (and very entertaining),"This is a wonderfully well arranged collection of letters, testimonials, court records and other contemporary documents by and relating to Johann Sebastian Bach. The editors have selected items which paint a picture of a man who knew his own worth, (he argues for, and gets, a higher salary than his predecessors in most of his jobs)didn't tolerate fools gladly, and who had exactly the same problems church musicians today face.Incidentally, it made me laugh frequently. Some of his testimonials for former students show him damning with faint praise. His argument over who should appoint school prefects leaves you wondering who was lying. And his begging letters to his employers are masterpieces of not-very-obsequious charm.A great book to dip in and out of, and a resource every musician should own."
2,Displeased,"I bought this film feeling hopeful that it'd be exactly what I was looking for, wrong. This film was definitely a let down, especially because I generally have great taste in movies. The film was nothing like it advertised. It was way too soft-core and it doesn't show you anything except breasts and a coy smile."
2,Boring,I did not find this to be entertaining. Horrible acting. To me it was a waste of time. Would not suggest this movie
2,bad movie,"The movie was brand new when it came to the house. I have no issues with that. Couldn't get into the movie. 20 minutes into it, I stopped it and then threw it away."
2,ANIMAL ATTRACTION on DVD,"As a media fan this movie is, shall we say, titillating with a cute concept, but very disappointing. It is very slow and has minimal music."
1,The book not to buy about training & grooming your poodle,Mr Dib likes to take picture so if you want to look at pictures of poodles - get this book. If you would like to know how to train your poodle - get another book. Mr. Dib's recomendation to you on training is to take your dog to a professional trainer or to sign up for obedience school with your poodle. The pictures are nice tho.
4,Lovely synth pop,Jon Sonnenberg (=Travelogue) used to be a part of House of Wires. Here on his second solo album he plays a quite simple and minimalistic electro synth music with nice vocals and good musical ideas. Get the first one too.
5,Incredible!,"This book was the key in starting a relationship with my mother in law. I cannot thank Jones enough for what he has done. Jones deserves a lot of credit for what he has done, and I suggest his other books to everyone! Dave, MA"
3,Not Worth It,"I've had this set for a few months now and it is not my favorite Barbie Product.Here's Why:*Not very durable. The displays fall over too much and therefore didn't add much to the set. The stickers tend to fall off, also.*Hard to put together. It took me ages to put the purple stroller together, and I'm 12 years old! The shopping cart and other things gave me trouble also.Overall, this is not a very good playset. It took forever for me to put it together and altogether wasn't really worth the 14 or 15 dollars I spent on it. If you want a quality Happy Family set, check out the Happy Family Baby Nursery, which is very fun and durable."
2,Not worth the $,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It is mostly made of cardboard and tons of very small pieces. It is not sturdy and most of the time falls over after every little piece has been placed on the shelves. In putting it together and punching out all of the cardboard pieces, we even tore a few. There are many other Barbie sets that I would strongly suggest in place of this. This toy is not durable and is very frustrating!"
3,not worth the money,i got this toy with my own money and i think i wasted it bigtime! i play with the products more than the store.i think it should have been bigger and come with more stuff i nd not have had all that crap painted on the card borad backs to the shelves and i think it should had come with plastic strong backs instead of card borad stuff. i uassly take out the card borad backs and make the store be a grocery store i would NOT buy this toy i would by the nursery playset instead.im 11 yrs old
2,This isn't jazz.,"Don Cherry is known for playing jazz, specially WAY out-there jazz. This really isn't jazz, though. It's more world-music type stuff.Don Cherry mostly plays several asian (?) flutes admist a background of mid-east/asian sound scapes. I guess it might be intersting if you were into that sort of music. Or if there was any sort of theme or melody here, but there's not."
3,Didn't Read this,Will have this for basic study at some point otherwise its just taking-up space on my Kindle. Hope to get educated on Russian Novelists though.
2,Comfortable but....,"Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot, however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out."
3,"Too small, heel is very slippery","This is a beautifully classic shoe and quality is nice. The heel composition is the exception. It is a hard, hard plastic or rubber. It is very slippery on tile or brick floors. Be careful. As other reviewers indicated, the sizing is off. Consider ordering a half size larger."
4,Beautifully made shoe but not good for me,It does not have quite the support I need in a shoe--wish that were not so as it is a beautiful shoe.I also need to have a heel that is rubberized as I found it easy to slip while testing out the shoe.
1,Why? Why? Why?,"Did anyone read this dreck before they wasted the film? I don't expect high art from this genre, but nothing about this plot made sense."
3,Turkish Language Reform by G.Lewis : an opinion,"This book is for libraries and I'm not a librarian. It is a book for highly specialized linguists which I am not. So obviously I made a mishtake in buying it, but I will not blame this on Professor Lewis. What I wanted really was a middle-brow account of Kemal's language reforms, of which I knew but little: the crazy extremism of the whole thing appealed to me. Well, Lewis' book did give me a good part of the story, but then it goes on to a treatment in minutest detail of the language reform itself, with learned arguments for and against Turkish linguists and discussions of word families and even single words. All in all, a huge deal more than I ever meant to bite off, much less chew and swallow.It's OK with me but it may be a great book for highly specialized people steeped in the Turkish language.I DO NOT regret buying this book.Alex TrierSantiago, Chile"
3,Just ok,I love anything coconut and was hoping for a more coconut scent - but was a bit disappointed. I would hardly call the scent coconut - but more of a generic incense scent. It's not highly aromatic but not offensive at all.
2,Sorry - I just don't get it,"I tried reading this book from front to back. I tried skipping over chapters that seemed repetitive. I tried it every way but upside down.The ""method"" appears to have been inspired by the Marx Brothers movie in which Groucho portrays a doctor.Patient, lifing right arm above head: ""Doctor, it hurts when I do this.""Groucho: ""Don't do that. That will be $25 please.""Or, as expressed by this book:Reader: ""Doctor, it hurts when I feel sad.""Writer: ""Don't feel sad. That will be $11.56 please."""
3,"Good, but maybe over rated.","Very interesting book. However, is a little too much ""the power of positive thinking"" for me. I was not able to ""release"" effectively."
1,You'll be sorry if you read this book!,"This is actually a good book. However, this method's results are negligable at best; and otherwise seriously depressing. If you read half of this book, you'll likely be left with a feeling that you have too many suppressed negative feelings to overcome in one lifetime. The author says to welcome the feeling, then ask yourself if you're willing to let go, and then if you are, ask yourself whem. Then supposedly the negative feeling is released forever. What a crock of garbage."
5,The Sedona Method,"This is probably one of the best books anyone could ever read. If you are looking for a way to remove unwanted emotions, behavior patterns, etc. this is one of the easiest to read and one of the quickest ways to do it. I can't say enough good things about this book. You can see results quickly."
4,Letting go!,The author presents us with a technique of how to confront life's daily challenges.I believe the author has done a good research on the subject. I find the techniques handy and useful. it's all about how to let go of our emotional baggage.It's not about positive thinking. It's just letting things be.To relax and let things run its own course.A good book for those who cannot subscribe to the idea of God yet looking for a method to relax oneself.
1,Completly Incomprehensible,"Without question, this is the single worst book in the self-help genre I've ever seen. Completely incomprehensible, irritating and frustrating. While many books of this type don't really deliver on their promises, this is the only one I've ever read that will make you feel WORSE! Dwoskin repeats over and over and over that ""releasing"" (which he never really explains how to do) is ""simple"" and ""natural"" and ""easy"" and you'll get results ""immediately"". So, of course when there are no results you start to think that you're some kind of sociopathic freak because you don't ""get it"". If you're depressed, this book will make you suicidal; if you're angry, it'll make you homicidal. And please do NOT waste the $200 on the CD's just to listen to this guy read the book to you. You'll wind up throwing the whole mess in the dumpster and wishing you had your money back."
5,This book will change the world,"This book made me happier and more successful. I've tried numerous self help books only to find little to no improvement. If the whole world read this book, their would be world peace."
3,"Interesting, incomplete concept.","A friend of mine insisted this book would change my life. It didn't. It's an easy read, with an interesting premise, but not fully fleshed-out. It's OK."
2,Jury Still Out,"Read and reread this book. Highlighted it. Tried it. It seemed to have no discernable positive impact on me, but other people swear by it, so who am I to judge? For me though, it did not work."
5,Best approach to stress relief available,"This was the first book I have ever read with real life techniques to apply to your daily living and get rid of stress. Not just go to the gym, take a break from work etc. He takes stress and deals with it in such a logical way - I have been able to put the stress in a basket and close the lid since I read this book. I still get situations where I can do better but it is a learning curve and I gave this book to my daughter's teenage friend who is already 3/4 way through it and it is a huge help for her. It is practical and helps you create situations and deal with them one by one. Once you learn the technique it will just take a bit of time to perfect it but you HAVE to start..."
3,Old wine - new bottle,"Much of the information contained in the Sedona Method we've all read before. It's valuable stuff but feels like it's cut and pasted from the books of Deepak Chopra, Eckhart Tolle, and Jack Canfield's earlier Chicken Soup for the Soul. More profound, cutting edge, and life-changing thought is contained in Tolle's The Power of Now and Chopra's new book Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire. These books walk you through the new phases of your life and explain very clearly how to change and how to live your life's dreams NOW. Given the choice, I'd sink my soul into one of these two books."
5,Powerful,"When I was introduced to The Sedona Method, I was skeptical but did like the idea of having a peaceful life. I found a copy in a bookstore, started reading and ended up taking the book home with me. In short: this book and its methods work. I reccomend it to anyone and even gotten my family and friends aquainted with it. Get this book, it will go with you for a long time."
2,not for the analytical,"I bought this book, along with the CD and really gave it my best shot, but found it gave me little relief (at least for my issues). I tend to be deeply analytical in nature and perhaps that's my downfall, since one must not attempt to 'over analyze' this method. Perhaps I'll pull it out again in a few months and try again. I have found better relief using other methods such as EFT."
5,A New Way of Dealing with Emotions and Feelings,"The Sedona Method is an excellent compliment to the books ofJohn Gray and The Secret. The ideas and procedures presentedare a way to learn to become free, and to gain understandingof how everything is linked."
5,it helps,A friend of mine recommended this bookI m working on the method and it helpsAnd you know practice makes perfectI tottally recommend it
5,Very good,"Lester Levinson came up with an ancient concept of letting go and put it into a simple to use format. He did not invent letting go, to the chagrin and confusion of many. I am not going to mention the person's name, however, the person who now writes these books, based on Lester Levinson's teachings, I believe has serious ego issues, and is a poor conveyor of Lester's virtually divine understanding of metaphysical principles. Look to Lester, not to the current holder of his teachings."
3,All is ok except,"I purchased the CD set and all is ok except the guy's laugh. His normal talking and laugh do not match and his laugh sounds like a drunk frat boy. He might just well add some snores. It's quite distracting, and I have been using Sedona method to get over this annoyance. I just started with the whole book and CD and I will be impressed if I can get over the laugh."
5,The single best Personal Develoment Book ever,"I am in my 40's and work as a business consultant for government and large organisations.I have spent more than $25,000 doing personal development courses during the last 19 years.I wanted something that is simple, takes no effort or discipline, and produces obvious results. The Sedona Method is it.I am so grateful to have stumbled across this book.I highly recommend it if you want to learn to feel better every day, and to have your feelings help you create the life you want."
4,A much more accessible form of Zen,"Let me start off by saying that I have an engineering degree, am an atheist, and don't go in for much of the New Age mumbo jumbo. I only read the Sedona Method because someone else recommended it. I'm glad I did, because it's made a huge difference in my life.While you won't find Zen mentioned in the book, the Method is really another way of achieving the same goals as Zen. We spend so much time wrapped up in our feelings, either reliving the past or anticipating the future, that we miss out on experiencing life now. At the same time, we focus so much energy on resisting the way things are that we cause ourselves needless suffering. The book provides a collection of techniques to address these issues, so we can enjoy now.So, why only 4 stars? I found that reading the book really only gave me a taste of what the Method promises. I had to also take the audio course to really understand the approach. However, even that initial taste was well worth the price."
5,Shortest Path from Anxiety to Inner Freedom,"As an international lead instructor of The Sedona Method, I find this book transforming for all who have read it.Look on any page and find GREAT inspiration to move past your fears.Most all of us have heard, ""Let go"". But how? And how to do it quickly and easily? Letting go of whatever appears as an obstacle is magic, miraculous, and totally your choice, but how to do it?! Read this book and find out.I hope to meet you in person!With greatest wishes for happiness for you,David Ellzey ~ The Sedona Methodwww.davidellzey.com"
2,Not really impressed.......,"This book was not what I expected. It didn't give a good plan on the methods behind the it. It spoke in generalalities with no specifics. I would not suggest it, and didn't even finish it because it was so boring. That's my 2 cents."
2,Ok nothing great just Ok,"This is just another self-help book. Lots of them out there, if it speaks to you great, then enjoy"
3,"LONG! Good message, but gets lost in examples.",This book is 414 pages long! It would be much more effective if it were shortened to under 200 pages.
2,Just Do It,"This book can be summarized in a few paragraphs. It's not that it is bad, but there is very little actual ""method"" spread over a great many pages.Insight meditation talks about the acronym RAINR - recognize a feelingA - allow it to happen, acknowledge the feeling's existenceI - investigate it with kindness and curiosityN - non-identity: don't identify yourself as your feelingThe investigation aspect of this seems to be completely missing from the Sedona method. You're just supposed to ""release""In addition, as in so many self-help books there is a tremendous amount of ""this is going to change your life"" selling. I was 20% into the book when I realized that the author had spent all of this time selling me on the concept. Plus there's some up-selling of seminars and audio discs and the like.Finally, the Kindle version has many typos and formatting problems."
3,Repetitive but okay,"The book has some good points but I thought the repetition unnecessary but may prove helpful for those who find the need to be told one thing in more than a few ways to understand. As for the message/method of the book I thought it worth putting to practice but I honestly felt it could have been a much smaller read at a lower price.Overall, I recommend the book if it is on sale. You won't have to read much of it to get the point."
5,this could be the best thing you've ever done,"The Sedona Method is just the key to everything. I've used the Method for three years now, and I've exprenced effortless success and every area of my life and you can too. The secret is letting go of all unwanted thoughts, feeling, and desires on the spot. Once you've mastered this wonderful technique, you'll find yourself using it literally thousands of times a day. If you want money release the desire for it and you'll have it. If you want healthy or mastery in any field release the desire for it and you'll have it effortlessly. This book shows you how. The greatest benefit from the book is not what it helps you gain, but he imperturbability that you get from using the Method. You reach a peace where nothing and no one could ever bother you. I highly reccommend buying the book."
2,Lost hopes,"I bought this book because I wanted to get over my rupture with my ex-girlfriend. It has really good reviews and I thought it was a safe bet to try it. Wrong choice.First I have to say that I had some results, but they were inconsistent. I would get a mild relief from the sadness and anxiety, but 10 minutes later it would come back.I tried all their tricks. Letting go of the feeling, letting go of wanting the feeling, diving in, welcoming the feeling, letting go of the basic want. Nothing worked as they said. Only, sometimes (not always), a temporary mild relief.I tried letting go of resistances. In that area, no results at all.In the light of all the good reviews and the success stories peppered through the book, maybe I am not normal or I am wrongly applying the method. However, I doubt it. The method is so simple that you cannot not apply it right.Buy this book if you want, maybe you are going to have more success than I had."
1,Comic Book?,I was very disappointed when I received this book and found it to be a comic book! I have really enjoyed the other CSI books so this was just a let down right off the bat.
3,"decent, but got 60 psi unit","This product I was sent a 0-60 psi unit. I won't bother to return it, but don't expect to get the 0-100 unit, despite what the product heading states. Otherwise, it's a pretty good tire pressure gauge."
1,Hard to know - they sent the wrong item.,"My tires require 85 PSI so I needed a new 0-100 PSI gauge. This item is described as 0 - 100 but the item they sent me is a 0 - 60 PSI gauge. Interestingly, the label affixed to the back of the package, says 0-100, but the gauge face tops out at 60. I'm sending it back - frustrated at the waste of time and effort."
5,White Patent Leather Jessica Simpson Round Toe Pump,"I don't buy a shoe I haven't lusted after for a long time, and it was no different for this pair. I thought long and hard before investing in these shoes, and I'm really really glad I did. They have an absolutely adorable shape, and the bright white color was exactly what I was looking for. They are also extremely comfortable to wear, and walking in them is a breeze. I get tons of compliments on them every time I wear them out."
4,Almost a Five Star Production,"Seriously. If it weren't for the occasional ""inspired by"" track, this OST would easily be in line for a five star rating. O'Donnel's stuff is magnificent, with the occational Incumbus track mixed in as fire support. Unlike the first OST, H2 definitely has more of an rock edge to it, and it's an edge that sounds awesome in or out of the game.Aside from Hoobstank's unwelcome appearance- I mean, we're talking about music that belongs in something like a Tony Hawk production -there's not much that'll touch this CD in an American game title. Hell, the first remixed track is nearly worth the price alone."
5,Great game - great music,"My son wanted this Cd. I had never sat long enough to listen to the music when he played Halo, so I didn't have a clue what I was buying. He let me listen to some of the tracks once it arrived and I had to ""borrow"" it from him so I could download the cd onto my pc. Needless to say I bought volume 2 and the original Halo soundtrack cd as well. They may belong to my son, but I love these cds too!"
3,Dual Personality Soundtrack,"I bought this CD thinking I'll get a wonderful CD like the original Halo's soundtrack. What I got was a CD with dual personalities! Whoa! The orchestral part of the CD (like 14 tracks) are wonderful and cool. The inspired-by rock crap sucks and is intermingled throughout the CD, screwing up the listening expreince. Thank goodness I have playlists capabilities on my iPod so that I can eliminate the rock crap and listen to the orchestral stuff like it should have been. The Hoobastank song truly sucked badly. The Incubus stuff is OK."
2,Not really my thing,"If you're looking for a soundtrack, this isn't it, get volume 2. I ended up tossing this one. Just couldn't get into this. There's a reason for not allowing you to listen to it ahead of time. Just one person's opinion."
5,Unlike any other,"This Cd contains the greatest video game music i ever heard. I listen to a lot of rock wich and this soundtrack features my favorite rock bands. It also has the songs by Martin O'donnel like the halo theme. I loved this CD but if ur not a rock fan, i wouldnt really recommend this, but buy it anyway!"
3,"Good in the game, ""eh"" out of context","First things first: I have to admit this soundtrack fits the game and its mood as perfectly as is humanly possible. HOWEVER, I would advise against buying this just for the sake of the music. I would obviously highly recommend this CD if you're a Halo fan of any degree; I know I buy the soundtracks to every video game of mine for which one is commercially available. Taken out of its proper element (the game), though, this music is just sorta ok. It gets kinda eerie at times, and, honestly, who would want to listen to something subdued and creepy a la Exorcist while driving around town? Not me. I want something kickin', like rock, metal, or pop. All you Halo fans out there: forgive me for ragging on this soundtrack. I just don't think it sounds nearly as good on its own than it does in the game."
4,WAT!!,I thought that the breaking benjamin and hoobastank songs were AWSOME. i feel bad for you b/c you don't know a good song when you hear one. I love this cd!!!
4,Halo 2 Sounds Good,"You guys are retarded... The song from Breaking Benjamin is great and fits just fine with the rest of the score. The Hoobastank track on the other hand is not as good and doesn't really fit. Most of the new soundtrack is all alternative rock anyway, including the main theme and most of the other instrumental tracks. It's also interesting you didn't notice that the Breaking Benjamin track was actually produced by Martin O'Donnell. All in all a fairly good soundtrack. My personal favorite track has to be the Ghosts of Reach track, simply a haunting song."
2,Love Halo 2 but not the soundtrack,"I got this because I like the music in the game, but some of the stuff on the soundtrack really disappointed me. At times I thought I was listening to Riverdance or Enigma. At other times it reminded me of Santana or even Miles Davis. I expected to get a CD that would put me in the Halo mood - agressive, powerful, ready to rock. What I got is so ecclectic I wasn't even interested in playing the game after listening to it. Maybe you'll like it, but I'd return it if I could."
5,Hoobastank?,"For those of you wondering why Hoobastank is in the album, I personally think its foreshadowing. We all know thanks to ilovebees.com that bungie will do anything for advertising or excitement. Listen to the words of the song and think about how Cortana and Master Chief always get thrown in together all the time. Maybe this comes into play in Halo 3 (and yes, there will be a Halo 3)."
5,great soundtrack but..,"This cd concerned me for I thought it would only have composed music. But the Breaking Benjamin and Incubus are perfect. I can listen to it almost every day and never get bored with it. Thats how good it is. But there is the hoobastank song that suck's, but don't let that discourage you. All and all this album is the best, and I can't wait for vol.2"
3,Not what I had in mind...,"The Halo 2 soundtrack was poised to be without a doubt an excellentone, with beautiful tracks from the game itself. After purchasing it, i am little short of dissapointed. Many of the game's atmospheric tracks have been altered, and distorted in such a way that it is difficult to even imagine the game featuring such rubbish. Extra tracks have been added, and even though it has been said that these tracks feature in the game i am yet to find them and hope not to. they completely disrupt the flow of the music,If anything saved this album, it was the fact that at least a few songs have remained largely true to the game, although being very short and slightly modified. Why couldnt they have just kept thesoundtrack true to the game? because that is why people buy it!!!"
5,Great soundtrack for any Halo fan,If you listen to music while playing video games like i do then you will not be disappointed with this soundtrack. The music from this disc along with the original Halo soundtrack make Halo 4 alot more enjoyable in my opinion. Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori have created some amazing pieces of work. A definite buy if your a Halo fan
3,Millennium is poetic,"Overall, the CD is O.K. but millennium tops the songs on this list. It is poetic and can be interpreted from a religious perspective. ""Is it a warning""?"
2,Not very helpful :(,I agree with the other reviewer. This book is terrible if you want to learn how to write naturally. Everything is computerized and the characters are all in bold thick print as though a marker drew it. It makes it impossible to see how to write a letter and/or word naturally. Everything seems to just blend together. There are NO examples of actual handwriting whatsoever. I think the author could have done a much better job. Also he really doesn't tie the ideas in together to move from one point to another. Definitely would not recommend this book to anyone else. There simply must be something better out there.
5,THIS BOOK IS DIFFERENT!,"I liked the plot of this book, and enjoyed this author's simplistic style. It's short, more like a first draft, but the storyline is so good it carried me along to the exciting, surprise ending.I really felt sympathy for all Rehak's characters. They were real people, experiencing all-too-human situations and combatting them in the only way they knew how.I found some faults--but mostly in style--but all in all, Crippled Dreams is a good, fast-paced read."
1,"Plot, what plot.","I have never read anything by this author before, and after having read this book will do everything in my power to avoid doing so in the future.All the characters are one dimensional, with the plot being just a secondary consideration. The entire plot (what little there is), revolves around each characters belief, or lack of, in God. The characters have no other motivation.[...]"
4,Almost a 5..but I can assure you that a 5 will come to this,"sensitive author soon. It has been my pleasure to be a part of this author's growth, if only in reading his novelas.In this soul-devining tale of a man crippled from birth and pampered by an over solicitous but well-meaning mother: we are swept along dark corridors of despair and strain our eyes and our hearts looking for that light at the end of the tunnel.The Cain and Abel relationship of the two brothers, Alexandre, the cripple and Gustave, the 'perfect' one, becomes even more intriguing when Marie-Anne is stirred into the mix. A beautiful girl affianced to Gustave and loved by both brothers, she plays a major role in the surprise and emotionally satisfying ending.Rehak writes with a charming simplicity and smooth seques to form an enchantingly gripping story.I look forward to his next and hope he continues to supply us with many more hours of reading pleasure."
3,desperate,Using Amazon was easy and I received my purchase much faster than I expected. Thanks Amazon! I will be a future user of Amazon.
4,Very Cool,Another great one from Leiji Matsumoto. The animation quality is A LOT better now. It still has it's style from Yamato and Harlock. The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is because its too short.
1,Uninteresting extremely dull,"I had to purchase the book for school, and I was very displeased and how dull the book was and innaccurate."
5,The Perfect Anthology on African American Literature,"I first bought this book for a class in college. Some of the excerpts, poems, and novels in this book I read in other classes, but I found that having all of them together in one anthology is perfect. Its progression from slave narratives that begin in Africa up to early hip-hop of the 1990's keeps the reader intrigued, moving along, following the struggle in America. There is simply too much to go over in a little review, but I can definitely say that this is a must have if you are interested in reading African American Literature...I just wish I kept my cheaper college copy! Oh well, at least I have a new copy this time ; )Richard Beckham II, author of the coming of age novel, ""Frog in the Pot"" and fantasy novel, ""The Tale of Mu"" available on Amazon.com.Frog in the PotThe Tale of Mu"
5,awesome,"great book, great information. it is bigger than its appearance on the screen, but don't worry, you will love it.great value."
1,Here's some true gossip....this movie is terrible!,Maybe one of the worst movies I've seen.....I was looking for a suspensful movie in the line of Wild Things from '98....this doesn't come close to that one....beware people....pass on this one.
1,Why this ending? Why in the name of god?,"This movie for me was the biggest let down of my entire life. Almost this entire movie was great, the acting was great, the music was great, the camera work was great. then the writer or the director(i am not sure who is to blame)gave the movie the WORST ENDING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. The ending is made that much worse because of how good the movie is until then. if you are going to see this movie just know to have a vomit bag with you at the end."
3,Very Weird Movie.,I wasn't too sure about this movie when I first started watching it. It has a lot of famous actors and actresses in it. It has a very very shocking and suspenseful ending. People are suppose to be killing each other and then it all comes to an end fast. I would recommend this movie only to people who enjoy drama films.
3,"update: POE ""music video""","in refrence to the ""Grab Bag"" section of the ""special features"" on this DVD:I spoke with POE yesterday about this whole ""Gossip"" thing. she said she was totally unaware of a music video for ""My Lips Are Sealed""... how can there be one that she's in, that's she totally unaware of you might ask? well... what the production company has called a ""music video"" is actually the entire dance sequence filmed for the movie... that only about 30sec. of was used in the actual movie. so... she's not too happy about this."
3,Enjoyable Trash,"Gossip is far from a masterpiece, but is good, trashy fun, as long as you don't take it very seriously. The film, about some sleazy and wholly unbelievable goings-on at a college, is shot like an advertisement, and has a lot of gorgeous actors and actresses (Kate Hudson, the lovely Lena Headey -it's a pity she's not more famous) and the ending is unconvincing, but if you accept the whole artificiality of the concept, you will enjoy it as much as I did."
3,Shhhh....,"Being a huge Kate Hudson fan, I had to see this film despite horrible reviews. ""Gossip"" centers around three college students; Derrick (James Marsden), Jones (Lena Headley) and Travis (Norman Reedus) who start a sexual rumor about a virginal-yet-icy classmate Naomi (Hudson). At a party, Naomi and Beau (Joshua Jackson) go in a room alone and he leaves. Naomi is found passed out. Jones, Travis and Derrick circulate the rumor around campus that Naomi and Beau had sex, then that turns to rape. Naomi, being drunk, doesn't remember much of the event and believes that she was raped. Hush....no more, you have to see it for yourself!My only complaint about the film is that it does not fit into a genre, is it teen or not? The actors are in their early to mid-20s (ideal for teen movies) and the ending was very confusing and WEIRD. Overall, it wasn't that bad. It's better that a lot of other, um, teen movies."
3,Breaking Glass Does Not an Art Film Make,"If you like pseudo-artsy camera shots of breaking glass, this movie is for you.If you're over 22 and have graduated from college already, you might find this film a little tedious. Unless you're drunk.And speaking of drunk, why is it that every college ""student"" in this film seems to have a huge apartment, complete with a full bar? I know drinking is alive and well on college campuses, but sheesh... most people go to bars for the highballs, not their living rooms!The good thing about this movie is that just when you're ready to chuck it all because of the very unlikely plot (since when was it really gossip material that college students are having sex???) the twist occurs, and it all makes much more sense. It simultaneously validates your feeling that the movie couldn't be more farfetched and absolves you from the guilt you were feeling about purchasing/renting a really dumb flick.Rent it, watch it with friends and laugh."
2,a predictable thriller,"gossip is really predictable and it really got stupid and the camera views and the acting went dry. it helps with the help of Norman Reedus(Deuces Wild, Boondock Saints and Blade2) and Eric Bogosian(Undersiege2, a bright shining lie and igby goes down).if you watch closely, the emotions of Lena Headley are great and im saying this in a sarcastic way. James Marsden is basically a washout in this"
1,more 1 star,"Just wanted to bring the review score down some more, saw this on Netflix thought the preview was interesting but boy was I wrong.- the ending was the worst, impersonating police officers and faking ones death is illegal and there would be a good chance the evidence would be inadmissible, also entrapment.- one of his roommates I think hates him but he allows her to live in his expensive loft for free she would have been gone a long time ago.- The people in this film are so gullible they believe every dumb rumor that comes up and everyone keeps turning on one another because of it."
2,Not as smart as it wants to be,"It's got a good premise: start a story and see how many people get a hold of it and how it changes before the truth comes out. It plays with the idea of yellow versus real journalism. I like that. Unfortunately, the execution is seriously flawed. We go through all of this twisty turny stuff that's telegraphed ahead of time and then gives a very unrealistic and unsatisfying conclusion to the whole thing. If you've got nothing else to do, watch it with some friends, but i guarantee that the conversation it provokes will be a lot more interesting than the film itself."
3,Did you hear???,"Okay, the plot of this movie is a very simple one. Three student in a journalism class decide to try out a little experiment, by planting a rumor about one of their fellow student. Experiment turns out to be a success. That is until, the student turns dead. Then things turn very deadly for the three students, when the police start asking questions. Then students must try and really figure out what exactly happened before they end up like her. This wasn't a bad thriller. Both Kate Husdon and Lena Heady did a great acting job with thier rolls."
4,History Buffs Delight,This trilogy makes compulsive reading. It's like historical chicklit!I think Gulland has a wonderful way to make the details come alive. Josephine is fully fledged and the world she inhabits pulses with life. A history lesson that reads like page-turner.
5,Josephine,"For Bonaparte lovers, whether it be Josephine or Napoleon, this is a fabulously informative collection. The books are delightfully descriptive and the information well sourced. The collection is a wonderful set to purchase, especially for those quiet mornings, holidays etc.., as it is an easy read, even though the days of the Napoleonic era were full of intrigues and much deceit. The books take you to another time and very much into the minds of those being written about, this in my view can only be achieved by an Author who has researched and has a passion for the chosen topic. Do buy this collection, as you will not be disappointed."
5,Pulls you into the trilogy never to return.,"I purchased the trilogy mostly to read about Josephine from her point of view. However, by the end of the first book was totally hooked. It's easy to find books on the historical wars and many campaings that Napoleon championed; however, these books seen from her point of view and that of her children are spell binding. By the third book where Josephine is crowned Empress and because she could not produce a male heir is divorced, I cried throughout the entire book. It was clear that she was the love of Napoleon's life. Had it not been for his horrible, horrible Corsican family, the course of history would have certainly been changed - in my opinion. Perhaps I'm just a little too romantic for my own good. In know this is a work of fictional history, but Napoleon truly did write some very intensely romantic and erotic letters to Josphine. It's good to see the other softer and emotional side of such a brilliant military genius.An excellent read!!!"
5,Josephine--a woman of her time,"Sandra Gulland is quoted as saying that Josephine ""is a woman more of our time than her own."" NOT SO! In this otherwise wonderful triology, it is, I think, hard for the contemporary woman to see Josephine as anything except a victim--of her first husband, of the Revolution, of Napoleon, of her mother-in-law and the viper's brood she bore. Within the constraints of her victimhood, she is an admirable woman, generous, a good mother, a (belatedly) devoted wife, a fine empress, but always victimized by those around her and by her era. I strongly recommend the triology. Once I began reading the first book, I couldn't stop until the last page of the third novel, yet, over and over, I felt emotionally distanced from Josephine when she became a door-mat for those around her. She deserved a better life; instead, she got three wonderful novels written about her."
1,NEEDS WORK,This CD is not to be confused with the killer/brutal death metal band (IMMOLATION) this is Infestation:Mass Immolation. First off there are a couple of worthy tracks but with so many death metal bands its not a CD that offers anything different then other death metal. I say skip this and pickup (IMMOLATION-DAWN OF POSSESSION) or (IMMOLATION - HERE IN AFTER) if you want an great classic Death Metal CD
2,A boring read... it looks cheap and it has NO PHOTOS,"These ""tips"" seem outdated and unrealistic. I would have loved to have seem some examples of what to do and what NOT to do, as far as posing, a portfolio, and meeting agents. It seems like it was written very fast, and sloppy, with no practical advice, and no photos in the book at all..."
1,No photographs or real advice...,"I was surprized to get this book on modeling, and it had no photographs. It had advice that any model agency would give you with a simple phone call. I would not reccomend it at all.. sorry..."
4,Good Beginners Guide,"This book is excellent if you want to know more about the modeling industry, but I have probably learnt more from experience and from other models, than the book. If you don't have any connections, this book would be a very nice resource to have. It does give good advice. I like how everything is explained pretty well, but I do not think it takes a book for you to realize whether someone is trying to take your money. I think it is pretty simple to just go to a legitimate agency for their open calls, and if it leads somewhere, they should teach you everything you should know about the modeling industry anyway. This publication is a better modeling book than the other ones I have read before. I would suggest this book over other modeling books because the information is worth the price of the book, and it is told by a real sucessful model."
1,Waste of a tree!,"Roshumba Williams may very well be the sweetest person on the face of the earth but this book is terrible! Contradictive statements, lackluster presentation, absence of photographs, surface information and a feel that it was published to grab a little piece of the book sales pie. I question if the positive comment writers really read this book. And how can anyone who knows this Roshumba Williams personally write an unbiased report about this book?I am afraid this book was thrown together by a corporate ladder climber who duped Roshumba Williams into believing it was a great way to make MONEY. Doesn't seem to have been built for the end consumer in any way. I can see only two uses for this book. A door stop as I am now using mine. Or print the next batch on toilet paper thus rendering it useful.A total WASTE of my hard earned dollars!!!"
5,The most beautiful stories I've ever read,"I first read TALES OF THE DERVISHES thirty years ago, and I've been re-reading them ever since. My daughter preferred these ancient stories to the standard Western fairy tales at bedtime, asking me to read them to her over and over again, which delighted me because I too found them spellbinding. It's easy to understand why they've endured a thousand years because they are perhaps the most beautiful and intriguing examples of the storytelling art that I've ever encountered."
5,Best book to open the windows in your brain,"After 10+ years of reading the stories in this book, I still come away with a different level of understanding of each story with each passing year. A master storyteller, Idries Shah's writing reaches right into the very thought processes that make you who you think you are and then snaps you into remembering who you really are on Earth and beyond. Like an onion, the stories all have multiple layers. Only with time do they reveal themselves. Good for the beginner as well as the most advanced --"
4,4 stars still means [...],"I also came across this band at warped last summer and their debut is plain sick! This band holds their own with the likes of norma jean and as i lay dying. These guys are talented and have put together a great cd for a low budget debut. Not quite 5 stars but these guys definitely have that kind of potential and I'm looking forward to a follow-up. Best songs are 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 but all are worth listening to. If you're into metalcore and screamo, do yourself a favor and find this record."
3,ACCEPTABLE,"Unlike the matching bracelet I previously ordered from Amazon.com, this necklace was acceptable in that the Mother-of-Pearl inlay did not have a gross defect in its surface. Value for the dollar spent, but no bargain by any means."
4,good buth not as good as the books/audio's,"Here is one of the better movies about the 87th.precinct. Don't like the actors much, buth dialogues are good and similar to the dialogues in the books. Prefer the B/W TV-movies with Robert Lansing and Norman Fell. Buth still the price worth,even if you are not a McBain fan. Hope to see more where this came from."
2,TIRED COPS,"When you have a movie where you know the identity of the killer, you HAVE to make the story move so you don't lose interest. Unfortunately, in 8TH PRECINCT (based on Ed McBain's ""Lightning"") fails to provide the chills and suspense necessary when you already nowhodunit!!!! And by the end of the movie, the killer's motive is so predictable, it's almost laughable!!!In trying to capture the ""grittiness"" of McBain's popular series, director Bruce Paltrow only manages to give us lifeless acting, no true suspenseful scenes, and an embarrassing romantic entanglement for Randy Quaid and deaf mute Deanne Brey. Randy is not as apt at this type of role as those in which he is allowed to release his inhibitions and chew up the scenery. Alex MacArthur as his partner who finds out his wife is cheating on him is also flaccid and uninteresting.Good plot, weak script, poor acting, Ed deserves better than this."
5,unbelievable!,"If your a quinten fan in the least, you wanna buy this set! Its worth way more then the price.It comes in a hardcardboard casetoprotect it and its not one of those easily cracked plastic cases.The movies are of course, all his best and theres alot of extras included with each film. BUY THIS! You wont be sorry"
4,Quentin Tarantino Collection VIDEO Review,"Length:: 2:33 MinsQuentin Tarantino is one of the most influential directors of all time.This video, (all credit goes to J. Walden for his brilliant editing!), shows his action-packed, sharp, and brilliant resume of films:Reservoir Dogs (1992), Pulp Fiction (1994), Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003), Vol. 2 (2004), Death Proof (2007), Inglourious Basterds (2009), and Django Unchained (2012).Starring: Michael Madsen, Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Eli Roth, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Christoph Waltz, Bruce Willis, John Travolta, Robert de Niro, Pam Grier, and Brad Pitt.This set is a must-have for any Tarantino fan.P.S. Thanks for reading and watching. This review is part of a series of Director Collection Reviews I'm writing.Feel free to comment, I appreciate your thoughts!"
4,Quentin Tarantino:,This Director knows how to make an action flick. His movies can be watched over and over and never get boring. I bought the whole collection in the hopes he will produce more.
5,Awesome set!,"How can you go wrong with these movies?? You cant! If you like his films, buy this, you will not be disappointed, especially for the price."
2,Flowmaster Muffler,"Well it shipped on time which was nice. But didnt even get close to fitting. Now its partially my fault for not checking that my muffler was 2.25"" dual in and 3.00"" center out, but I feel that Amazon shouldnt have put ""Direct Fit for your vehicle"" when only the measurements of the inlet and outlet fit."
4,Good value,The lamp is beautiful and a great price. Just be aware that the measurements listed on the site are to the outside edges of each piece of wood so the lamp is a little smaller than the picture suggests.
3,"strangly enough, in a sense a bit homophobic","I'm not going to write a complete review of this DVD, the previous reviews already give a lot of information. Joaquin, the main character of this movie, is bisexual but with a preference for men. Then why is it that his first heterosexual encounter with a woman is shown quite explicitely, and his first homosexual encounter with a man is hardly shown at all? And this happens more often in this movie. Don't get me wrong, I'm not asking for a gay porn movie. However when the main character of a movie is predominantly gay, then it is a bit silly if his gay encounters are hardly shown at all, and his heterosexual encounters are shown lengthy and explicitely. The love scenes are important for the movie, but then homosexual encounters and heterosexual encounters should have been shown with equal explicity. The movie now feels rather unbalanced in this respect, and makes it much more difficult to understand the feelings of Joaquin."
4,What the movie means to me.,"For much of the 1990's, there have been numerous attempts by Hollywood and MTV to capture the thoughts and feelings felt by a gay man without much avail. ""Don't Tell Anyone"" succeeded. As I skeptically watched the film, it not only made me feel ""normal"", but it also defined some of the comon trials and tribulations that the average homosexual male must overcome in the path called life. Where many movies have failed before, ""Don't Tell Anyone"" has succeeded. I strongly recommend the film and I hope the next person enjoys the feeling as I did."
4,Impresionantes actuaciones,"Aunque casi llegando a la pornografía, las actuaciones de Santiago Magill y Christian Meier son magnificas y bastante creibles.La adaptacion propiamente de la novela de Jaime Bayly es un poco exagerada, pero creo que conserva la esencia de la narración.Esta película muestra como la intolerencia y la ignorancia puede influir en una vida desordenada de homosexualidad, drogas y perversion.Al final no deja ninguna leccion clara, pero en resumen es una pelicula muy entretenida."
1,Add English sub-titles!,"I didn't know this film does not include English subtitles and I don't speak enough Spanish to truly enjoy this coming out story, but Santiago Magill's full erection and buns of steel in the nude scene with the girl almost makes the purchase worthwhile. I was fascinated by this gorgeous guy in ""Before Night Falls"" so I went hunting for other films and found this one, ""City of M"" and the gay ""I Love You Baby"" (which has subtitles but is stupid and disappointing otherwise)."
3,I enjoyed this but preferred the book,"I'm not sure if the book is available in English, but Spanish speakers may want to check out the novel as well. Highly praised by fellow Peruvian writer, Vargas LLosa, the novel's main character, Joaquin, is not quite as ""nice"" as he's made out to be in the film. He's almost an anti-hero. I guess I was expecting the same snobby, racist character of the novel, hence my 3 stars. The acting was good, although the gay scenes weren't as ""explicit"" as the hetero ones. Still, a pretty brave film in a homophobic world. See it."
3,Drugs everywhere,Why is it movies about homosexuality always involve a large amount of drugs? I liked the way this movie started out with him young and living at home. But as soon as he goes off to college it goes downhill from there. He turns into a drug addicted drunk who will lead a girl on into thinking he will marry her and then dump her as soon as he thinks he has a boyfriend. And then he ruins the life of his lover by telling his fiancee that they have been sleeping together. In the end he gets back together with his girlfriend. It looks like they're going to get married soon. But then his lover comes back and it looks like he's ready to dump the girl for a second time. The guy is a jerk.
3,EXCUSE ME?,"I WATCHED THIS FILM AFTER HAVING READ THE NOVEL EXPECTING IT TO HAVE LESS ""BLACK HOLES"" THAN THE NOVEL DID & IT TURNED OUT TO BE A WASTE OF TIME. I DISLIKED THE FACT THAT THE MAIN CHARACTER NEVER ATTAINED THE COURAGE TO STAND UP TO HIS IGNORANT, MISOGYNISTIC, & EXTREMELY HOMOPHOBIC FATHER. AT FIRST I FELT COMPASSION FOR JOAQUIN BUT AS THE STORY PROGRESSED I BEGAN TO ABHOR HIM FOR HIS LACK OF CHARACTER & SELF-ESTEEM. I COULD WRITE A BOOK ON WHY I DISLIKED THE NOVEL/FILM BUT I'LL SETTLE FOR REJOICING IN THE FACT THAT ALTHOUGH I HAD A SIMILAR CHILDHOOD I DIDN'T TURN OUT LIKE POOR JOAQUIN. LUCKY ME!"
5,Quite Amazing.,I was wondering around the library during my lunch for a change and when the library lady came to tell me to do something i quickly grabed a book from the shelf and it was this! IT WAS FATE I COULDENT PUT IT DOWN! Seriously if u havent read this book borrow it or but it or whatever JUST READ IT!
5,This is my favorite book!!!,"This is the greatest book EVER. I bought it because the title made me laugh, and I found out that the rest of the book was just as funny. This is the book that got me interested in tennis, and Im going to play on my school team next year because of it. I think that Stan seems like a very real teenage boy, and so does Ginny. My favorite character was Antonia Wheeler. Although, I did really like some minor characters like LeRoy Blankenship and the man in the bathroom. Id recomend this book to anyone."
4,Great Flower Girl gift!,We gave these to our five flower girls at my daughter's wedding. They were delighted and have a visual reminder of their day.
4,Flowergirl Gift,"I bought this playset for the two flowergirls in our wedding. They both are 5 years old, and absolutely loved it."
4,Includes a politically correct bias,"Author Cynthia Cavnar condenses the life of Edith Stein into the most readable book yet. Information is contained herein which was not mentioned in longer biographies. However, in the few pages in which Cavnar discusses Pope Pius XI and XII and their roles in the fight against Nazism, Cavnar misses the mark, downplaying Mit Brenneder Sorge (On the Church and the German Reich) by Pius XI and ignoring altogether Pius XII's Summi Pontificatus (On the Unity of Human Society) published in 1939. I would have to recommend ""Edith Stein: St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross"" by Maria Ruiz Scaperlanda over Ms. Cavnar's title although the former book is a little less readable."
1,Hat recieved is not hat pictured.,"I thought I was getting the hat pictured the all navy blue M's hat. What I recieved was the blue hat with the teal bill. They did give me a label to send it back at no charge, but just be aware."
4,Animal Chin - Plot,"When Animal Chin, the 62 year old master of skateboarding goes missing, the Bones Brigade (Steve Caballero, Tommy Guerrero, Tony Hawk, Mike McGill and Lance Mountain) goes on a search for him."
1,How could anyone possibly like this book?,This is the worst thing I have ever tried to read. I can't believe anyone would give this guy a book contract.
2,"Ok, if you have a native speaker to help you","The book covers a wide variety of words and sentences that would be helpful to someone traveling to Kerala. However, the explainations of pronunciation are confusing and require the help of a native speaker to understand. If you know Sanskrit or one of the Dravidian languages, the book is adequate. If you are familiar with only English, you should get additional resources to help you learn Malayalam."
4,Anonymous sexy strippers!,"""Playboy"" quit making videos in 2009, but I find some I missed at ""amazon.com"". This one sounded good. I already own one ""Playboy"" video with sex stars and some videos with strip routines from Hot Body, and I figured this one would be similar. Some of the girls are very sexy and have sexy scenes stripping on stage for crowds of men. I don't recall the names of the girls, but I'd like to see more of a few of them. I can take or leave the helmet camera guy or the brief interviews. Strippers are fantasy girls, so what they say in interviews can ruin the fantasies we have about them. I've seen pretty and sexy girls in ""Playboy"", ""Penthouse"", etc. who turn me on ... until I learn that they're totally incompatible with me from reading the profiles, e.g. some girls love Rap, and I hate it, so I couldn't bear to live with a girl who ever played such (C)RAP!"
3,Is Stripping Really An Artform?,"Overall, this video was decent. The nudity was explicit, the strippers were sexy, and the picture quality was decent. Unfortunately, the ""performers"" were not well-known stars and a few had almost boyish breasts. Sometimes the action got a bit too freaky on the stage. It was not uncommon for the camera to focus on a naked stripper slapping herself ""below the belt."" In addition to this, the final scene featured bondage that involved nipple-whipping and hot wax. This stuff doesn't seem to jive with Playboy's supposedly ""classy"" image. The backstage footage, provided by some idiotic device known as the helmet-cam, did add a bit of flavor to the video. The ladies, most of whom were in the buff, talked about various sexual topics and showed the camera their ""favorite body parts"". Overall, this video pales in comparison with Playboy's: Strip Search Featuring Top Adult Stars."
3,"Garbo - 5, Print Quality - Zip","The box is labeled ""In Glorious Black & White,"" but the b/w print available on video is horrendous. It's not only in black and and white, but due to the ancient quality of the film transfer, it also changes to blue, amber and red. And their are spots, blips and scratches all over the film. This video can't compare to the b/w quality of 'The Kiss.'The picture is clear. The music is wonderful. And in silence, you can see why Garbo was considered such a phenomenal sex symbol, before trite dialogue rendered her a stately object of dated romance. But she looks phenomenal, and gives more intelligence to the material than it probably deserves. If only the print quality were better."
5,Just what I was looking for!!!,"YES!!! I had looked everywhere for this book,since it is no longer in print I found it and am very pleased with my purchase."
4,Wouldn't recommend for larger rats or squirrels,"I bought this to try to trap a pet rat who was thought to have escaped in the basement. It was smaller than I'd expected considering it's supposed to be large enough for squirrels (though the box actually says RED squirrels, not gray squirrels, which is what I was assuming).I tried it to see if it would work on one of my other pet rats before setting it for the escapee. It did work very well, and he luckily wasn't hurt, but if his tail hadn't been off to the side, it would have been whacked pretty good by the closing door. I'd worry about injuring the tail of any animal rat sized or larger. If you're looking to catch something that size, try the next size up for safety.I love Havahart traps and highly recommend them, just be sure to get the appropriate size."
5,havahart trap,"My husband was very excited to get this trap, the doors work efficiently and we caught about 15 chip munks in the first 36 hours of its use. Other models are inferior, and our local suplliers couldn't come through for us."
1,Too small for squirrels,"I've had this for over a week. The bait is getting eaten and the trap is getting sprung, but still nothing caught. I think they don't get all the way in and the door falls on them and they get away. I would give it 5 stars if it were called ""The Squirrel Feeder""."
3,surprised by the size,I thought it was for squirrels of any size. I am surprised that it's for small squirrels. I hope it will work foradult squirrels
2,Squirrels????,"This is waaaaaaaay too small for squirrels. Chipmunks just fine, but when a squirrel trips the trap his body is half way out of the trap so he just runs away. Great quality but no way it works for squirrels"
2,A good try?,"Maybe this would have worked if our rats were less intelligent, or maybe if I was more, lol. I'm not sure if I set it up wrong or not but the rats got the food out without it going off and we had to resort to other methods."
4,Success,"I spread peanut butter on the plate and then sprinkle bird seed on it letting some bounce around. The chipmunks start eating the seeds and trip the doors closed when they reach the peanut butter. Our issue was the chipmunks raiding our birdfeeders. We place the trap along the ""chipmunk highway"" and it is successful at least 50% of the time (vibrations and wind trip it). They have never gotten away with just stealing the food. Now my only issue is having to drive them to their new home. Setting it is a bit tricky because of the quick release, but given how fast the chippies are, it has to be."
4,small trap,this trap is smaller than i thought and the squirrels are very smart too its use..i must figure out a way to fix the trigger to allow the animals to enter all the way in without first setting it off...the wood block the directions tell you to do did not work on my squirrels.i should of bought the next size up..i will win the war though....
5,Great trap!,"Trap works as advertised; simple to bait and set. Animals are not harmed when they are trapped. The trigger device is sensitive, but not too sensitive to close automatically."
2,Difficult Havahart Animal Trap,The Havahart 1025 Two-Door trap did not work very well for capturing small Rabbits. Several times I watched a rabbit walk through one end and out the other without closing the trap.
3,Sensitivity is hard to set,"The default sensitivity on the trap that I got from following the instructions is too low. It was very hard for me to trigger it myself (and I'm stronger than a squirrel). I had to I jerry-rig it to have two tips/ends of the metal rods mostly touching each other - in a precarious position where they are under a lot of tension.When I jerry-rig it, the trap will often go off on its own - without any squirrel.When I can jerry-rig it properly, it works. I've caught two squirrels."
2,"rats get bait, don't get caught",It was out for weeks before I realized the bait had been eaten and the trap had not closed. Rebaited and had the same results.
3,Trap,"Trip mechanism very touchy, needed some work to make not so sensitive. Even after some modifications still getting false trips."
2,Not Effective for Squirrels,"This trap has not been effective in catching a squirrel in my attic. While following instructions and baiting the trap with peanut butter and crackers, the trap has been cleaned of the bait on numerous occasions without tripping the door release.. There have also been three occasions when the bait was removed and the doors did trip shut, however no squirrel was captured.Even though this is advertised as a squirrel trap, apparently it does not work, unless the squirrel is small enough to get fully into the trap before tripping the release. I can only assume that the times the trap was tripped, the squirrel was able to hold the doors open with some part of his body while eating the bait. Very frustrating efforts over a two week period. I also had contacted Havahart and was using their suggestions for baiting the trap differently than called for in the instructions.. that didn't work either.I am planning to try a slightly larger trap (1079) based on reviews of that model."
4,a tip to increase your catch rate...,"A little bit of advice for folks that are finding the bait gone but the trap was not tripped. If you are using peanut butter put a small amount on top of the bait pan and then smear some on the underside of the pan. The animal will more than likely try to manipulate the pan to reach the peanut butter on the bottom side and the chance of triggering the trap will be greatly increased. This works for those traps that people find less ""sensitive"" as well. Good Luck!"
2,do not use this trap for transport.,"This trap uses gravity to hold the door close. If you transport your animal and the trap tips over, the door will automatically open and if you have the animal running in the car, good luck! The cage must be at a horizontal position at all time if you do not want the animal to jump out when the door opens automatically at high angle."
2,too small for full sized squirrels,"It is a bit frustrating to try to bait and set up this trap. It often trips itself and spills the bait. But, the worst thing is that it did not work for the squirrels we have here. I see now that if I had read the product description carefully I would have seen that it was for red squirrels, not grey squirrels, but I did not think much about it since the name is ""two door cage trap for squirrels"". Get this only if you have LITTLE squirrels where you live."
2,big disappointment,"Havahart 1025 Live Animal Two-Door Squirrel, Chipmunk, Rat, and Weasel Cage TrapI have about 5 chipmunks living in my front yard around my wife's flowerbeds. Bought the 1025 to take care of the problem humanely by relocation.Using peanut butter I watched them feast for 5 days with no success. After reading the reviews posted here I tried placing the bait in different areas like underneath and above the trip tray. I finally caught one 2 days later which still wasn't good results. The main problem lies in the tripping setup. The chips only weigh 2 to 3 ounces and it takes more weight to trip this trap. Needless to say I returned where purchased and got a 1 door model 0745. I caught a chip in 10 minutes and in 2 days caught the other 4. So if you need a trap for chips get the 0745."
3,Meh,"Got it to control the squirrel population in the Jack Pines lining my property and they seemed to have the upper hand in figuring out how to get the tasty treats without setting it off. I tried several tricks mentioned (peanut butter on the underside, putting nuts in the middle with peanut butter to stick them as the bate, etc) and nothing has worked. Maybe this spring will work out better."
2,Too small for squirrels,"The trap has a couple of issues.First out of the box, the trap would not work. The trigger mechanism would not shut the doors. After bending the rods a little bit, the trap was working. Not a big deal for me, but definitely not a good first impression.2nd problem is that the trap is too small for squirrels. I had squirrels in the attic and she got the bait (teeth marks visible on the remainder) and closed the trap doors but no squirrel inside. My guess is that to get the bait, the squirrel was not all the way in with either the tail sticking out or even the body and once the trap was tripped, she was able to back out because she wasn't all the way in. I bet the trap would have worked for a smaller squirrel or rat or chipmunk but not the squirrels I had."
2,Good design but too small for Squirrels - need larger unit,I have the other Havahart one door design products & they work well but I've observed squirrels much more interested in the two door since both sides are open.Problem with this unit is it is too small for squirrels. Part of their body sticks out the sides and they can stop the door from coming down and squeeze back out.This size probably works great for mice or maybe rats but much too small for squirrels......buy the larger unit.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,These traps are WAY too small!! The squirrels are hanging halfway out when it goes off. Worthless!! Buy the bigger one.
2,Didn't work for me,"The trap's concept is good, but after trying for 2 weeks using 2 traps, I have officially given up. Somehow the rats keep setting the traps off without getting trapped inside. I don't think there's enough space for them to escape once the doors latch down, but they might be running through the trap without stopping to eat the food. I tried shutting one door, but I don't believe they ever ventured inside when it was in that position. Whatever the case, I set up a couple of old ""snap traps"" last night and caught 2 rats. I'm betting that I catch more tonight. Bummer, because I really would have preferred to catch and release them somewhere far from my home. I gave it 2 stars only because it seems like it could work...it just didn't work out for me."
3,"Works, but...","I caught the squirrel, so the trap does the job.To set up the trap is way to flimsy. I had to bend/adjust the trigger mechanism until I got good results. After the third day/night it worked.I'll use it again, but I'm not sure whether I would buy it again."
1,Worthless,So far I've caught nine critters in the single door trap set up right next to this one and not a single critter in this one. Get the single door model.
4,live squirrel trap,"Arrived on time, was just as described. Hasn't caught my squirrel yet though, but that's not your fault. He's a sneaky little booger."
4,Pack Rat Catcher,"I'm looking to eliminate pack rats from my back yard. So far, I have ""caught"" two. The first one remained captured for a couple of hours - it was the middle of the night, so I could not take care of it right away. I could hear it from my bed as it kept running back and forth over the tray, looking for a way out. By morning, it had escaped - the doors were still locked so I assume it squeezed out of the corner where the door comes down. I understand that rats can squeeze through a hole the size of a nickel, so that is apparently what happened.I then used pliers to bend the four lower corners of the two doors inward a bit to decrease the size of those gaps. The next night I caught another rat (I don't think this was the same one), and this time it was still there in the morning. Tonight I will set it for the original rat again, as I need to get her to stop nesting in my gas grill.Cheese as bait has worked fine so far. Releasing the captured rat was pretty easy, a few miles away."
3,"May have to file sharp points, works well","Extremely sharp burrs on the ends of the wire mesh at the bottom, where the squirrels pull to try to escape, gave a squirrel bloody paws. It took a few minutes of filing to correct this, but broke my heart to set an injured squirrel free in the cold weather.After fixing the edges, the trap has worked very well, although it's easy to see how slight individual variations in the finicky trigger mechanism could produce either overly sensitive or insensitive traps, as some have reported.Spreading a little peanut butter on the pan worked well, although it does get onto the squirrels fur so use a modest amount.Despite claims I've seen elsewhere that you need multiple traps because squirrels will see their buddies trapped and avoid it in the future, I found that rinsing it (perhaps not necessary), placing it in the same place with the same bait worked fine.Looks too small for large squirrels, and I would have gotten the larger one if I had to do it over again."
2,Did not work for my squirrels,"I am new to this trapping adventure, but the trap did not work for me - it was simply to small for squirrels around my house. A squirrel would enter only partially, with butt sticking out, trigger the door, yet and were able to wiggle out.Got a bigger trap, and caught a possum instead.Very frustrating."
3,Havahart for small squirrels,"The latching mechanism (trip levers, etc) on the side of the cage are extremely sensitive--you have to get them positioned exactly right, then carefully edge the trap to the spot you want. There are no instructions about this that come with the trap-- you are on your own. But the trap did get the squirrel--so if you don't mind fooling around with it for about a half-hour you should be OK."
2,USELESS FOR RATS.,"So far the only thing I've caught in this trap are very pissed off squirrels (so if you're needing to get rid of squirrels this trap is for you!) -- BUT if you have a rat issue, don't buy it. If you manage to coerce a rat into the trap, all they do is turn the trap upside down and the door opens right up and out they go. Want the ""Happy Trap"" back -- so much better. Didn't matter how much they tried to turn the trap, it didn't open!"
1,Looks like I'm now the food pantry,Well I got the Item and I've done nothing but make my pest happy! He is enjoying his organic peanut butter. I've set it 2 times to find him eating it outside the trap. The last time I checked the trap was shut and locked but again the squirrel was not in it!
3,have not caught a squirrel yet,"i have been using the old style traps by havahart and caught 33 squirrels last year. i put this thing out and have not caught one yet, minus one peanut. not sure if it is not sensitive or not or if it is too deep in that they have to go to get the nut. The older traps where mid way. hmmmm. something is different but i have only put it out for a few days. normally it takes a few hrs.. Assembly was difficult. I was very surprised the directions where crap. horrible drawings that gave no clear direction. I in the end figured it out myself."
1,SMALL TRAPS,TRAPS TOO SMALL TO CATCH RABBITS. COST ME TOO MUCH TO RETURN. 1025 DESCRIPTION NOW SAYS SQUIRRELS.
1,Havahart 1025 trap,The Havahart trap never worked!!! I tried the paste that could be purchased..... both un-shelled pecans..... shelled pecans. The squirrels still run around and taunt my dogs! A waste of my money!Lisa
5,Havahart Trap,"I bought this trap to control the chipmonks around the house. I bought the trap late in the season, and now the chipmonks are hibernating. I did catch one chipmonk using peanut butter before they disappeard for the season. I drove it 1/2 mile away, and let it go in a nature preserve. I will be using the trap this spring when they show up again.The trap is well built, and is quite sturdy."
1,flying squirrels escape,"first i had a hard time where the trap didnt trigger and bait was gone. so then i attached a stick to the plate and at the end of the stick a small bowl filled with bait. well that worked great by creating leverage. i heard the noise in the attic, ran up, squirrel looked at me, rammed the door twice dilodging the locking bar and took off. worth it? i will let you be the judge. not sure if i have super intelligent squirrels in my area. These suckers have to be super smart of the luckiest things on the planet. this was the 2nd brand trap i tried and both have failed. the first the squirrel simply squeezed around the sides of the door. i think i now have to take lethal action. sorry little dudes. i tried my best for a full month and i need sleep."
5,Works great!,No more chipmunks! Used tomato and pecan/walnuts for bait. You may have to file the bait tray activator rod tip to make it more sensitive. Try it first.
5,havahart 1025 live animal squirrel cage trap,"It's a good trap for humanely capturing and releasing pesky chipmunks that gobble up almost all of our tomatoes. We used it once, capturing the King of the chipmunks. Now we built barricades to the tomatoes that the chipmunks can't easily climb.I would recommend the product."
3,Trap is too small for squirrels,"The trap is fine for chipmunks. I can catch those first try. It's not quite big enough for squirrels. They don't get their body in far enough, so when it trips, they scurry out before the locking mechanism can deploy. It sometimes takes 10 resets before I catch the little bugger."
5,Buy one!,"I purchased 2 of these traps and they work very well! I was having 'issues' with the local chipmunks and squirrels and wanted a humane solution to reducing their numbers. Without baiting them, just setting them on the ground, I caught 17 chipmunks and a squirrel in a week. (I can not believe there are still many more left!) All were released back into the wild a mile or so down the road. I did not have the demeanor to dispatch their little lives permanently. Works very well for chipmunks, but for squirrels, they will need to be baited. I just wish the local clan of foxes would do so well! Very sturdy, well built and should provide many years of service."
2,too small for squirrels,"This trap is too small for squirrels. It may work for ground squirrels and chipmunks, but a ""tree"" or ""city"" squirrel is too big for the trap. We needed to send it back for a larger variety,"
3,trap is hard to set right,"The trap is spring loaded, so if one does not set it delicately, the spring device is too strong to let go of the trigger. We did finally catch the rat, however. It liked peanut butter on triscuits."
2,Trip mechanism,the trip mechanism is difficult to set so that slight vibrations (e.g. wind or the animal just starting to enter) don't set it off.
2,"Good idea, bad implementation","Length:: 0:32 MinsI think this trap is too small for squirrels, at least the ones around my house anyway. The squirrels aren't completely in the trap when they trigger it, so they can escape. The traps are double-ended, so if they enter the other side the same thing happens. It would be better if the trap was a lot longer so there was no chance of the door hitting the animal on the way down. There is no problem with the trigger mechanism, although it is hard to understand it the first time. It will trigger and close fine. The trap st just is too small for a big squirrel.I have had no luck at all with this trap for squirrels because of the size problem. Maybe it could catch a mouse but I don't have a mouse problem.Sorry for the camera shake in the video, I had a very long lens bu no tripod at the time the video was taken."
3,Too Small,Propduct too small for squirrels. Works great for chipmunks. 15 caught in the short time I have had it. Caught two within 15 minutes.So it works great. Just get next size larger for squirrels.KW
2,Not for Large Squirrels,"The average gray squirrel in my neighborhood is just too big. It says on the box it's for small red squirrels, chipmunks or mice. They should really indicate that as well on Amazon in the description. Based on the directions I set it to the ""one door"" option for larger squirrels, but they still spring the trap without getting all the way in"
3,Model 0745 More Effective,"Bought both the 1025 and 0745 models. Caught squirrels with both. One observation was that with the 1025, the smart squirrel would carefully look around and end up placing their paw on the set trap door, setting off the trap, resulting with an empty trap (several occasions). The model 0745 is a better design. Save money buying expensive trap bait, peanut butter works great!"
1,Would like to return it,I was advertised to catch Squirrels. It did not work. You did not put the dimensions of the cage. This is false advertising
2,Would recommend a larger trap,I borrow my neighbors trap (havahart) and it is larger and has helped me catch 5 chipmunks. This one doesn't work well and the one it trapped got away. Bigger is better.
2,"Need to do some ""finishing work.""","One of the doors ""sticks"", enabling critters to not set-off the trap. I need to do some ""finishing work"" to ensure that BOTH doors close properly when the bait holder is moved/disturbed."
4,works,It worked and I haven't used it for over a year.....good to know I have a product that will work when I need it.....
3,Havahart Trap,"I bought this to trap some rats in the neighbors fruit trees and found it to be a bit touchy when setting, I never caught a rat but did trap a sparrow in the morning before I could remove the trap, the bird was not hurt and released without hurting it."
1,Did not work with my rat (don't tell me I should get Havahart 1020 instead :-) ),"We bought this model in order to catch a rat who had entered our home. We bought this one rather than the 1020 on the advice of another Amazon customer - see comment titled ""Falsely advertised as a Rat Trap"" at http://www.amazon.com/Havahart-1020-Two-Door-3-Inch-Cage/dp/B0000DINGG/ref=pd_rhf_p_t_1 - we knew that ours was a fairly large sized rat. We tried it for over a week but with no success at all. Either the rat just ate the bait or the doors got shut without any rat inside. It is possible that we may have been doing something wrong but a good product should be idiot-proof IMHO.To the product designers I have the following suggestions:- keeping the bait plate horizontal is not very easy- one can never know for sure if the trap is too tight (in which case it will not shut easily) or too loose (in which case the trap closes even if it is mildly disturbed"
1,Too small for squirrels,"This trap is way too small for the squirrels around me, it is more like a chipmunk or rat sized trap. I highly recommend you sketch out the measurements before buying so you can see how small it is. 5 inches by 7 inches is a very small width/height. After I got mine I went to Harbor Freight and got a larger trap for about the same price, and so far I have caught two squirrels in two days in the larger trap while this Havahart model sits nearby untouched.If you are transporting your squirrels I recommend you put the whole trap in a disposable plastic bag as they will likely pee when in the car."
1,Bait always empty does not spring TRAP,(I got the larger trap for Rabbits see my other review. I was worried the trap was to big for teeny baby bunny and wouldn't spring well it did 2 hours after I set it I caught him and relocated. Great!)THIS trap is Awful! The sunflower seed always empty and trap not sprung! I am now just feeding the chipmunks! This is going back as it does not work!
2,Could the French ever make a movie that is not about adultery?,"I'm wary of complaining about what a movie could have been about; however when Truffaut writes a story about France in the Second World War, I guess I expected something about the grittiness and moral complexities of living with the Nazi occupation. The movie touches on resistance and collaboration but Truffaut's delicacy, sensitivity and humanity rarely scratch below the surface. More energy went into getting the stars decked out in immaculate fashion statements than taking a hard look at how the French managed Fascism.And of course, that old French movie standby, adultery; the pain, the exquisite pain of loving the wrong person.Yawn."
2,An Interesting -- But Biased -- History of Nuclear Power,"Published by the Sierra Club, written by a trio of left-wing environmentalists shortly after Three Mile Island, Nukespeak doesn't pretend to be anything but the polemic it is, a book-length tract for the anti-nuclear movement (which, at the time of writing, was gearing up for the ""Nuclear Freeze"" movement as well). That the political agenda is so heavyhanded forces this reviewer to give the book only two stars; however, it must be noted that Nukespeak contains an excellent history of what it terms ""the selling of nuclear technology in America"" and it definitely added to the debate in its time. The problem is that this excellent history is presented with such overwhelming bias that there is no way to discern what is really true from the all-encompassing propaganda. This is not a scholarly book. If you don't like nuclear plants, though, this is definitely a treasure-trove of talking points."
4,Disney Crocs Rock,"My son LOVES his Disney crocs. However, the back strap broke about 6 months after we bought them, which is why there is one less star. We live right on the beach, and they are great for tossing on and walking down to the water."
3,Multi-Authors,"The only reason I bought this book is because my favorite Western Author, Elmer Kelton was listed as one of the key authors, as well as John Jakes, whose series on America I enjoyed reading. Whereas these two authors made a good contribution, they were not signigicant enough to hold a complete thread on just who was Tanner Moody, a ficticious name. In summary, I think we had too many authors to make this book a good read."
2,Improve your game...,"A better way to improve your game: Invest the same amount of dollars in live lessons.The video is mildly interesting to watch, but I found it of little value in improving my swing."
3,Defintely worth a listen,"Being a huge fan of Psychotic Waltz, I came across this by accident and found that it was Buddy's new band. I believe he does all the guitar work, and is pretty good. There are some very creative riffs and ""moods"" throughout the album. Don't be fooled, it isn't anything like Psychotic was, but still a good album overall. Looking forward to more from these guys....."
5,The Unsung Heroes of Progressive Rock,"It's a mystery to me why DeadSoul Tribe isn't much more popular than they are. This band is far better than the vast majority of bands you hear on metal radio these days. There is sophisticated musicality, exuberantly creative songwriting, masterful musicianship, thoughtful lyrics, soaring vocals--in short everything a prog rock fan could hope for. If you like this, definitely don't miss their final album, Lullaby for the Devil. Sadly, they recently announced their breakup, but we can hope that bandleader Devon Graves isn't ready to retire yet, and whatever he does next is sure to be great."
5,Still fine after all these years,"I still find Met-Rx to be the best overall formula for a meal replacement. The protein composition is the best for long term digestion, as opposed to the quick - in and out of pure whey."
2,I can't stomach it. Tastes horrible...like vanilla cake batter mixed with melted GI Joes,"Looking at the ingredients list, it looks nutritious and has a decent nutritional profile; however, I can't stomach it. I tried to drink a whole packet, but could only stomach half of it, before I felt too nauseated to finish it. Dumped the rest.Both this stuff and Myoplex I can't drink. They both taste like melted plastic.I'm sticking to Optimum Nutrition stuff. That stuff tastes lovely. Like strawberry shake. No plastic-y tastes coming from it, and has a similar nutritional profile."
3,cake batter,"It did not taste like cake batter at all, maybe pancake mix at best. I really like their meal shakes though I had the berry, chocolate, and vanilla too. So sometimes I would do half and half to mix up the flavors. I didn't really like the berry either so I would mix the cake batter and the berry, made it better. The best is to mix the vanilla and chocolate. Those are good seperate too. Three stars because the ingredients in metrx shakes are great and filling."
2,No Cake Batter for Me,"I love Met-Rx. I have put on pounds of muscle with Met-Rx. But stick with the basic vanilla and chocolate. This does not taste like you would imagine cake batter to taste. I was so excited when it arrived that I made one right after my first workout. What a disappointment. I had visions of licking the bowl when my mom was making a cake when I was a little boy. Instead it was sort of an artifical flavor disaster. So use Met-Rx for sure, just not this flavor."
1,Tastes like salty dirt,"I purchased this quite a few years back and didnt like it. I figured a decade later they would have improved on the taste...nope. Still disgusting, even when mixed with milk. I plan to return it."
1,Cake batter is not the flavor of this shake mix,"I am a huge fan of Met RX regular chocolate and vanilla protein powders and was so excited to recieve this delicious soundingcake batter protein powder. However, after waiting for more than a week to recieve it and being super excited to try it the product proved to bea huge dissapointment. Well the consistancy was like cake batter the powder did not mix well and was thick, clumpy and dried out dispite adding lots of water the first time and almond milk the second time. Additionally this product tastes nothing like cake batter. I was expecting a delicious childhood memories eliciting flavor but what I got was chalky bland flavor. If you are going to use met rx I would highly suggest sticking to the regular chocolate or vanilla flavors which have great taste and lots of filling protein."
2,"Short-changed on the quantity, wasn't issued enough credit","I ordered the Extreme Chocolate 20 packet at a lower price from this site than from the one I normally order from, only to find out at checkout that they charge an outrageous $10 delivery fee. I should of seen that lowball ploy coming, but went through with the order anyways. Received the order on a timely basis, but with only 18 packets instead of 20. I e-mailed my concerns and the company did repond back timely, with an assurance that my account would be credited accordingly. When I received my credit card statement, the amount of the credit did not reflect the correct prorated amount for these missing packages. I will not use this site going forward."
5,Will fill you up for sure,"I use this about once a week on average, mostly as a meal replacement, and partly for the protein etc. after workouts, and often to take to work. If you make it with milk, it makes a really thick shake, add a banana or peanut butter, or both, and the taste is even better, really great in fact, and the shake is even thicker. I now use about 1/2 milk and 1/2 water, and also add a banana to it. This is a shake to enjoy as a meal replacement, or after a grueling work out in addition to a meal an hour or two later. I've used it both times. Well worth it for the daily meal replacement, if that is your intent, or an occasional shake for what ever reason you choose."
5,VW transporter manual,"This is a must have for anyone with an old kombi. it is very detailed about everything with easy to follow steps (provided you are sort of mechanically minded). I use it regularly and it has been a great asset to me. IF you have an old kombi, i highly recommend you buy this book!"
3,Muted sounds,"As far as club music goes, this is pretty good. Shri (Shrikanth Sriram) mixes tabla with bass guitar and bamboo flute to create some pretty interesting sounds. Shri is an outstanding musician, having played with a number of other stellar musicians such as John McLaughlin and Zakir Hussain, but he is best known for his work with Badmarsh, producing club music for the London scene. I heard him on BBC and was fascinated by the percussive way in which he played the flute, but you don't hear much of that here. The sounds seem muted as Shri keeps himself contained within the genre, turning out grooves moreso than music."
3,Good but...,"Not as good as others by Badmarsh + Shri nor the previous solo cd.Though - ALTHOUGH - it have some remarkable tracks - Appa2, Di Floris and specially A Piece Of Peace - wich is an unforgettable intemporal and universal piece of music."
2,I wouldn't recommend this toy,"I purchased two Happy Families for my girls to play with. I purchased the nursery and I purchased a living room as well. I loved the look of the Volvo and purchased two. Well, it takes a Houdini to get the dolls into the car. Cute idea, poor engineering. I agree with the other reviewer who suggested a larger, more open car. I just wish Mattel made a car with the children's car seats and adult seat belts that was easier to play with. I am returning the other Volvo I purchased."
2,Very Frustrating,"I purchased this and many other family Barbie dolls and accessories for my 5 year old this past Christmas. It was a waste of money and ended up in our spring yard sale. While this was a wonderful concept, it would have been better if the manufacturer had taken into consideration that this would be played with by small hands with developing motor skills. The dolls are difficult to dress and are hard to fit into the car as well as the house and furniture. (...)"
3,not worth it,"i got this toy and i well its okay the back seat allways falls down. and it need to be higher of the ground.the door also needs to open and i wish that the seats were high of the ground also, i would not by this toy if i was you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! im 11 yrs. old"
3,LOOKS REALLY COOL... TOO DIFFICULT TO GET DOLLS IN AND OUT,"I REALY LIKED THIS CAR... CAR SEAT FOR RYAN AND BABY NIKKI...BUT GETTING THE DOLLS IN AND OUT IS A REAL CHORE. MATTEL DOESN'T MAKE THE SAME KIND OF BEND KNEES ON THE DOLLS LIKE THEY DID WHEN I WAS A CHILD, AND THE DOLLS JUST DON'T GO IN AND COME OUT VERY EASILY. NONE OF THE ""DOORS"" ACTUALLY OPEN, EXCEPT FOR THE BACK HATCH. VERY FRUSTATING FOR A CHILD. THE BABY SEAT WAS NEAT THOUGH...PLAYED LULLABY MUSIC TO SOOTHE THE BABY. IT WAS ALSO HARD TO RYAN AND BABY IN AND OUT OF THEIR CAR SEATS......MATTEL SHOULD TRY AGAIN ON THE FAMILYMOBILE."
5,This is a happy playset,"My daughter loves playing with this playset. She has no problem assembling the pieces. It is sturdy and kelly likes to have Midge and family come to visit.We like the presents,food,and the doggy. We have all the asssesories . Barbie and Ken look so happy and nice. This playset encourages happy( family) play . Kelly and I would recommend this for you and your Mom ."
1,Too frustrating!!!!!,"My 4 year old daughter received this toy for Christmas along with the Happy Family dolls. She loves the dolls themselves, but this car is an endless source of frustration for both of us. It is nearly impossible for an adult (and completely impossible for a child) to get the toddler and baby buckled into the backseat and no one in our family is able to get the adults in the front seat. This is my third child and we have had many toys in our house over the years, but none has ever been as poorly designed as this car. I would return it, but my daughter loves having a car for her family. I strongly recommend AGAINST buying this toy."
3,okay car,When I first got this toy I loved it but when I tryed to put my barbies in it was very difficult. It takes like 5 minutes just to put one barbie in. The best thing about the car I think is the pink talking carseat. So if you are looking for a car for your barbie...think carfully because this car is not worth the money.
3,Disappointed,"My daughter received this as a gift to go along with her Happy Family dolls. It is really hard to get the dolls into the car. Plus the doors do not open so you have to jam them through the sunroof. The booster seat is really hard to put Ryan in. I am not sure why Fisher-Price made such a hard car for these dolls. I mean, if an adult has a hard time putting the dolls in, then for a kid it is impossible!"
4,go vovo,"i bought this for my 3 year old nephew. granted, he doesn't use the child seats or other accesories but loves using it in conjunction with his other big trucks. plays with it all the time."
4,"Nice car, except....",We bought this car for my 2 yr. old son cause he pitched a fit for it. He loves any types of cars. He does play with it every day and has a Ken doll to go with it. My son comes to me several times a day wanting me to put Ken in the car. Its so hard to put the doll into the car. I get so frustrated with it. Wish I had read the reviews before I had bought it.
3,good but not great,"I have been using these stainless steel screws to build a teak deck. About one in 5 breaks off in PREDRILLED holes. They just don't have the strength to be pushed in rapidly, even after predrilling. Not sure what is better, as they are stronger then another brand I got, but still don't have the strength to go into predrilled hardwoods."
3,green onion dip mix,I ordered this product as it was impossible to obtain in stores. I have been enjoying it. I much prefer to mix my own vs. consuming pre-mixed dip in the refrigerated section or the jar version with multiple preservatives and an after-taste.
5,Wise Green Onion dip,I have been searching stores for this product after having used Wise Green Onion Dip mix for years...haven't been able to find anywhere. When mixed with 8 oz. of sour cream it makes a great vegetable or chip dip. Would definitely recommend.
1,Wise dip mix,"It was sooo old. Powder mix hard. I was VERY disappointed! The mix had to be ""mashed"" back to powder form. The taste was off. I've been using this for years, love it but the shipment I received has clearly been sitting in a shelf somewhere for a loooong time. :("
3,Wacht out!,"I gott this VCD, is not de DVD version, they don;t have the DVD version anymore , that i supous to get , i gott one VCD that doesn't have interviews and subtitles. when i did complaint about it they told me that i should read more becarefully next time, because the one that they are selling say's is only available in VCD and that's not true."
4,CUTE FEEL GOOD MOVIE,"This is a cute, tongue in cheek little movie about a girl and her family and the amusing situation they get into. I enjoyed seeing my favorite people in it and enjoyed seeing the ""goof"" on the Soprano types. Pretty funny. One of my favorite scenes is when Talia's character is watching her parents have a romantic dance that makes her long for a relationship like her parents have.I was glad to see that this movie is available through Amazon.com so that I can have it for the family comedy part of my video collection!"
5,Mambo Cafe (Thalia),"I watched this movie on tv and I like it, it is good comedy movie. I am fan of thalia so I buy this dvd because she had role only this movie, there is no exisit any movie about her."
1,Waste of money and time,"This movie was horrible. I continued watching it only to see if it would get better. It really doesn't deserve any stars, but I don't think that's one of the options. The actors did a teriible job portaying a Puerto Rican family. Paul Rodriguez must've said the words ""Puerto Rican"" about 40 times throughout the movie. I guess he had to remind the audience who he and his fellow cast members were portraying, because their acting was so unconvincing. I have never been a Thalia fan, nor have I enjoyed any of her other roles, but this by far had to be the worst one yet. Wait until you can see it on cable or network television. Really, don't waste your $."
2,Good movie for thalia,This movie was her first and she should continue to do more movies.. its a great one you have to see it..
5,Great Series!!,"Great anime!!!! The anime is filled with drama, romance, action, adventure, mecha, blood, etc. Personally, its one of my top 5 favorite animes of all time. I think any anime fantaic need to watch all 26 episodes. Not a waste of money at all!!"
5,Best anime i've ever seen,"The Vision of Escaflowne is the most beautiful thing i've ever seen on videotape. The story is enchanting, the animation and suspense wonderful. It deserves every star in the sky."
5,One of the best!!!,This has to be one of the best anime series I've seen in awhile..it ranks up there with Evangelion and Saber Marionette J. Don't hesitate to pick this one up.
5,A beautiful and gripping epic... compulsively rewatchable!,"Escaflowne is one of the few movies I've seen that can even come close to the delivering the same complex, emotionally satisfying, utterly enthralling experience as a good book. And the soundtrack is lovely, as well.Escaflowne is the gripping, beautiful, imaginative story of a schoolgirl magically transported from Japan to Gaea, an alternate Earth, where her clairvoyant abilities land her squarely in the middle of intrigues and grand dreams of planetary conquest. Fabulous epic fantasy with wonderful cliffhangers, character development, and a lovely romance-- Escaflowne is nearly impossible to stop watching once you start."
5,Beautiful!!! A must see,"I loved this series with a passion. From its intriguing storyline to its awesome soundtrack, a must see for all anime lovers!"
5,Vision of Escaflowne is brilliant ..,"whether you're a long-time fan of japanese animation or just getting your kicks for the first time, Escaflowne is definitely an outstanding example of brilliant japanese animation .. the style of animation is simply breathtaking, making the entire series not only pleasing to the eye but also creating a world full of characters that make you wish you could join them on all of their adventures! Escaflowne is also blessed with a magnificent musical score; music that matches the storyline and animation perfectly .. this series is by far my absolute favorite of any anime and i *HIGHLY* recommend it to anyone! my only complaint is that i wish there were more episodes .. fortunately, they're making an Escaflowne movie! hooray :>"
3,Remade for TV,"I prefer the original stuff better, but this had a pretty good plot and subplot flow. And it's a little easier to watch ALL of it when you hear them in English, instead of reading the subtitles."
4,"Good anime, bad ending","Like most good animes this series has a lousy ending. The mastermind behind the super cool ninja cloaking mechs? Isaac Newton . . But barring the crappy ending, it is a classic and worth watching.Who should buy this? If you liked gundam, record of lodoss war, beserk then this anime is for you."
5,can someone please tell me,"Can someone please tell me if this is the complete uncut version in japanese and english? I just want to be sure because it doesn't say that its uncut on the cover it just says complete collection, which I'm assuming means every episode is included but I just wanted to be sure because I really love this anime and want to buy it."
5,Esca Box Set,"This series is one of the most epic I have ever seen. The story follows Hitomi Kanzaki, a young high school girl with a crush on her senior friend. During a track meet, she is transported to Gaea, a mystical world where boys rule Dragons and Knights follow the codes of chivalry. Van Fanel is the boy king who takes Hitomi to his world and Hitomi finds herself entangled in the battle between Zaibach and the Abahraki and other countries. Along the way, she meets Allen Sheczar, Millerna, and various other friends who all aide in the conquest against Zaibach. They face Van's evil brother, Folken, and his insanely blood-thirsty commander-in-chief, Dilandau Albato. I guarentee Dilandau will make you laugh and cry...Filled with rich animation, wonderful music by acclaimed Yoko Kanno and Maaya Sakamoto, this set can not be missed by any anime fan, or anyone, for that matter."
3,Quick Read,Plaidy's books always look so daunting for their length but they usually end up being quick reads as was the case for the Royal Road to Fotheringay. All of her characters though do end up reading very much the same and it is only the circumstances of history which set them apart.
1,HATED IT,"Because of my latin teacher - he drove us too hard through this book - therefore - to all you teachers out there, be patient with your students don't do a chapter a day - your 8th graders - like me - will hate you and still be baffled with the information - GO SLOW"
5,Very helpful dictionary,"Delivery of the expanded dictionary was on time. Packaging was good and kept my book in excellent condition. I have been using my dictionary during bible study for the past few weeks and it has helped immensely with my understanding of the Word of God. The font is small but readable, pages are thin but not too fragile. The book is light weight for its size. I recommend it to anyone seriously pursuing study of the bible. Use this dictionary along with The Strongest Strong's Concordance during study."
4,The decisive influence on EVH,"An interviewer once asked Eddie, ""I understand you were influenced by Jeff Beck. Was the album Truth?"". Eddie said ""No, I was very influenced by 'Blow by Blow'.""If you've ever wondered where Eddie got those flamboyant, extrapolated string bends, it was from Beck on this album. Eddie'd mastered Cream style classic soloing and was looking for something more out - in this album, he found a clue to the path. Not that Eddie sounded like this when he got done, but this album gave him the ramp to get to where he got."
4,some great instrumental/experimental from Jeff Beck,"This album is very interesting. It is a blues,rock,jazz and funk guitar album. The songs are all instrumental and feature some great guitar work from one of the greats, Jeff Beck. Jeff Beck explores many different types of music and blends them together and the results is fantastic. The best songs are ""Freeway Jam"", ""Diamond Dust"" and his tribute to the late great master of the Telecaster Roy Buchanan, called ""Cause We've Ended As Lovers"". Monumental guitarmanship from Jeff Beck."
2,Against the grain but urgently needed.....,"While Jeff Beck's offering here as well as his ""virtuosity"" have been touted by many realms of guitar aficionadom, I can't really say that the album here (or really much of his work) represents the best of the fusion genre or even serves as a mindblowing example of how electric guitar can be played without a pick (something that many Beck devotees point out ad nauseam...ugh). His ideas really don't coalesce all that well particularly here although ""Cause We've ended as Lovers"" has its moments but one song really doesn't cut it.Anyway if you really want to delve into fusion from around this time more check out Parliament, Miles Davis (""Bitches Brew Era""), or Santana. For good examples of electric guitarists who axe the pick (no pun intended) check out Mark Knopfler and Lindsey Buckingham."
5,"Jeff, the voice in the guitar","There is no other guitarist I can think of that can make the instrument communicate on such a Vocal level as Jeff Beck. On this album - and particularly on ""Cause We're Ended as Lovers"" - he plays with such soul and depth, phrasing as if his instrument is really breathing and singing for him.As for the rest of the album: George Martin's production (and string arrangement on ""Diamond Dust"") is sympathetic and always on the right level to carry every part of Jeff and his band's playing.Speaking as a singer, I can only rave that Jeff makes the guitar communicate so richly. He's the greatest, and this album offers ample proof. A beautiful album."
5,One of the Best Guitar CDs Ever Made,"Jeff Beck is the only guitarist from the 60's to keep evolving. His style has changed on every album. This CD features some of his most inspired playing with keyboardist Max Middleton from the Jeff Beck Group II. All the songs are instrumentals ranging from funk to jazz-rock with George Martin's (Beatles, America) excellent production. You probably won't enjoy this if you think the only great guitar players are speedsters Steve Vai and Joe Satriani."
5,This SACD is a definite must have,This SACD is multichannel so the music has been remixed. And the remix is simply amazing. The drums sound as if your in the room with them. The guitars are so present that you'd swear that Jeff was in the room with you. Even modern recordings rarely ever sound this good on my home system. As for the material this is Jeff Beck at this best. Of course it didn't hurt to have George Martin handling the production.
5,Stellar Performances,"This has been a favourite cd of mine for longer than I care to remember and having read some of the reviews posted here I can't believe no one has mentioned the drumming of Richard Bailey. He really drives these tunes for JB.His playing is a lesson in finesse and skill. Drumming with a mixture of funk and fusion. This cd along with ""Wired"" are absolute must haves for serious musicians."
3,One Track Makes it All worthwhile,"I couldn't agree more with the reviews which waxed poetic about the S. Wonder tune ""Cause We've Ended As Lovers"". I was first exposed to that song in high school after I found my very serious girlfriend cheating on me - I was crushed...but that song captured how I FELT. It is tender and sad, searing and angry, resigned and vengeful...an amazing piece. The rest of the disc is solid - but for me ""Wired"" is a much better disc overall"
4,Blow by blow by Jeff Beck,"Together with Wired and There and Back this is a must have Jeff Beck album. Beck is one of those guitar players that were able to develop a style and a sound of their own. If you hear a Jeff Beck album you know it's him by listening to the sound of his guitar and by his compositions. Beck is not only an excellent guitarist, he is also a great composer. This album is worth every cent, and you will listen to it hundereds of times, I guarantee!"
5,The Master Remastered,"Blow By Blow has been among my top 10 guitar albums since its original vinyl release, and yes I have purchased a copy in each of its incarnations (including the Mobile Fidelity release).I didn't think it could get much better than that, but thanks to advances in digital mastering technology, the 2001 remaster does offer noticable improvements. The separation of different instruments seems more pronounced, and the increase in the overall levels causes the music to virtually leap from the speakers.I wish all remasters delivered the satisfaction that this does (for me anyway).What's next? Perhaps an extended 2-disc remix of the entire session? I'll set a few sheckels aside, just in case."
5,Forgot how great it was,"Had this on LP in another lifetime, which has long since disappeared. When I heard Beck was writing new new, decided to buy the disc. This is just great stuff!"
1,"Looks Great, but Poor QUALITY","I really liked the way this hitch cover looks - the face plate is very nicely painted and all parts are made of very nice, heavy metal. The problem is there is no way to join the face plate with the hitch mount! There were holes drilled in the hitch mount and screws provided, they just forgot to drill and tap the holes in the back of the face plate - there was only one hole completed. I thought this was an error so I returned the first one as an exchange for another one. Nope, the second one was the same way. I even wrote a note to Amazon to let them know, but sure enough I ended up returning the second one too for my money back. I normally don't say this, but ""DON'T BUY THIS - YOU WILL JUST BE RETURNING IT!!"" I can't imagine anyone selling something this messed up without a way to take feedback to make sure this doesn't happen again. If it was made correctly, I would have kept it. It is as simple as that."
1,dvd quality,the dvd for several episodes is sticking and not moving forward properly. The dvd is sticking on more than one player.
1,Poor quality,"I am watching this and love them, but the quality is very poor. Wished I had not spent my money on it."
4,I disagree with the Krikus Review,"Maybe I'm a bolt (the Editorial review pans the book), because for me ""Care and Feeding of Ideas"" was an epiphany. Bill Backer's writing style drew me in as if he was sitting in an easy chair talking with me. I actually looked him up and called him to tell him how much I enjoyed his book. He offers a model with which to cultivate and nurture ideas. For me it resonated loud. The fact that he can point to a real-life success story gives his model credibility as well a way to clarify his approach. I was very disappointed in reading the Editorial review. Who should read this book? I think anyone who has felt frustration in getting an idea off of the drawing board and into execution would enjoy and benefit from reading ""Care and Feeding."" I read it nearly 10 years ago and still think of it."
5,Decadent Listening,"Decadance Cafe Ibiza contains three cd's (The Main Room, The Back Room, and The Terrace) each becoming progressively more chilled than the first. Each cd is a mix of deep, but not hard, house that is perfect for background music at a party or just to relax to. It is more upbeat and more full of bass than other chillout albums, such as the @Home collection. The good thing about this album is the variety of sounds on each cd. There is a jazzy song with piano and guitar, some with soothing vocals, and others you might here in a dance club, all on the same cd! Overall an extremely pleasant listening experience."
2,Response,"vanGogh was excellent.The Carpenters' DVD was very disappointing. Unfortunately, I ordered one for myself and a second for a gift. I'm sure the recipient was disappointed as well."
4,Wonderfull Karen,Karen Carpenter is also my favorite singer of all time. I could stay for hours and hours just seeing her sing. Her voice was like velvet. I'm a little disappointed to see that this DVD does not include all of her songs. I think that a GOLD DVD should include at least 3 ou 4 more newer songs. As it is I think it should be entitled SILVER only. I hope to see something better on Karen Carpenter in the near future. She and all of her fans deserve it.
3,"Fantastic, but doesn't take advantage of DVD capabilities","CARPENTERS-GOLD is simply a re-release of the VHS ""Yesterday Once More"", but with a 5.1 remix thrown in, and slightly better picture quality. These two extra features are good reason to buy the DVD, but not enough to justify the high price tag. What's really missing with this DVD? To begin with, A&M have failed to recognise the value of DVD techonology which allows for considerable space on the disc. Many more film clips could have been added, as well as a documentary ... but sadly none of these are provided. It really doesn't deserve the title of ""Gold"", perhaps ""Silver plated"" would be more fitting?Would love to see some real LIVE performances of Karen Carpenter. When are we getting a live DVD because material does exist."
5,Inspiring and Heartbreaking,"I have loved the Carpenters music ever since I was about 7 years old ( which used to get me some strange looks in the playground) and I am now 19 and while I listen less as my tastes have expanded I still think of Karen as one of the greatest vocalists of all time and Richard one of the best arrangers.It is inspiring that to people of all ages that 2 normal kids from Downey can achieve the success and reach the heights that they did.However some videos can be harrowing and even heartbreaking to watch as Karen and Richard's personal demons take hold.Richard was able to overcome his, but unfortunately fame for Karen came less easily and the price too high.She is gone physically her spirit and soul live on through her brother and her voice.Karen's star may have only shone briefly, but few have shone brighter and with more beauty."
2,be advised,"money (we all need more), makes the world spin 'round.... Richard; as controlling executor, of all things ""Carpenter"", should be ashamed of himself, in authorizing the release of this hackneyed sally of who i consider to be one of the finest contemporary vocalists.......a) the audio is at best, fair....b) picture quality smacks of a 3rd generation transfer, from a beat vhs tape...c) no 'bonus features', ie; interviews / studio-outtakes, etc...put succinctly, at $18.99, this is a complete wash..."
3,Lip sync a real disappointment!,"Karen Carpenter is my favorite singer of all time, and I was expecting to see her sing. Instead, the entire DVD consists of lip-sync-ing. The songs sound exactly like the recordings, and Karen certainly does not look like she was really singing. I don't mind a few music-video type performances, where lip-sync is the norm. But even the supposedly ""live"" staged performances where there is a ""performing"" band in the background are lip-sync-ed! That is cheesy! Furthermore, the video quality is very poor for a DVD. What is amazing though is that someone had the foresight to make these videos way back in the 70's. Especially interesting is ""Ticket To Ride""; I am surprised they HAD video back then! (That's lip-sync-ed too) I am still waiting for a DVD of Karen REALLY singing; I need to prove to myself that beautiful voice really belonged to her."
1,**sigh**,"I love the Carpenters, but unfortunately, this DVD wasn't what I thought it was. I assumed ... this was a full-fledged concert, but alas, it wasn't. The songs are wonderful, but honestly I was hoping for a live concert-that's my opinion-those of you who like full-fledged documentaries, more power to ya..."
4,Don't Believe What You See - All The Audio Here Is From The Records,"Great Video to have, however ALL of the songs you hear on this video are recorded directly from the records and made to appear that that the singing is live which of course it is not. All this aside let me say Karen you are missed. Hearing your voice is always bittersweet. You were the best."
3,Could have been MUCH better,"This dvd looks like the old vhs tape version with nothing added. Very disappointing sound quality - no surround 5.1 or DTS. If you already have the vhs release, don't waste your money on the dvd."
2,Fakes,"Firstly, the bag has the lining that is made for the authentic oskar waltz. The bag is fake, yes. But, not because of the interior color. Many LV bags tote alcantra linings, in shades of raspberry, mushroom and tan. Also, there are some lv bags that actually have orange linings. NOT ALL LV's have brown egyptian cotton lining. This bag authentic retails for over $5000, because it is made with exotic skins (Ostrich and snake) as well as exotic gemstones. Be the judge? No one in their right mind would sell a limited edition collector's bag for $250. As far as the outer appearance, it looks decent, from a distance."
1,fake or real?,usually if its tan inside the Louis Vuitton bag it means its fake. every single purse I have has the dark brown lining.
1,... These are fakes...,"Shame on Amazon for letting someone use this ""venue"" for selling poor fakes. You can't buy an *authentic* Vuitton Waltz for this price. Please don't buy this!"
1,Broke on first day,"1) The ball flew off within ten iron shots. No instructions on how to re-attach it. Looks like a significant design flaw.2) The instructions are contradictory ""grasp the SHAFT firmly with your fingers..."" but the picture shows the ball being grasped.3) The customer service number listed in the instructions (800 336 6264) ""is no longer in service"".I had the unit shipped through Amazon to my Chicago address earlier this year and brought it up to my summer place in northern Wisconsin to use - hence the delay."
1,NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT,"SNAPPED THE BALL OFF THE VERY FIRST DAY, AND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET A REPLACEMENT FOR THE LAST 6 MONTHS. IT'S A PIECE OF GARBAGE AND THEIR TREATMENT OF THEIR CUSTOMERS IS CRIMINAL.MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL GET TOGETHER AND SUE!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Less than a day, already broken","When I saw that most of the critical parts, the ones that bear the brunt of the force were made of plastic, I told my wife ""this isn't going to last long.""In the very place I had concerns is where mine broke. A simple metal pin, instead of a plastic one would have made all the difference.I also just noticed in these ""customer reviews"" that right after someone posts a negative review, a positive albeit anonymous review is posted. That always makes me wonder."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"Don't be fooled by the positive posts, I am convinced they are bogus.This is just a cheaply made toy at adult prices."
1,Not Accurate,This item is not accurate at all. I have complained to the company and no response. I told the company that it was off at least 50% and their only response was to try a different battery and if that didn't work try to return it to Target. Not impressed with the product or company. Ed Swanson
1,JUNK! BEWARE...,"This thing broke during the first use. Even when it did work, it would move when the ball was hit. This thing was so cheap, I knew I should have just returned it when I opened the box (I almost did). Please trust that you will not be happy with this."
1,junk,i just got this thing and hit it about 10 time and the pengulum broke and can not find parts. if I knew that the striking zone was plastic i whould of not got it...

4,feed your head,"Frank Hennenlotter has created a twisted, freakish masterpiece with this offbeat little comic chiller. Brian (Rick Herbst) is plunged headfirst into hell after a pleasant-seeming parasite named Aylmer hooks him on a strange hallucinogen he excretes from a needle in his mouth. While Brian is tripping, Aylmer gets him to walk him around the city so he can munch on the brains of unfortunate passersby. The scene in which a physically exhausted Brian tries to kick the drug cold turkey while Aylmer taunts him from a sink is one of the most chilling sequences ever filmed, and is apparantly even more brutal on the uncut DVD. Screwy, alternately hilarious and horrifying, and an effective allegory for drug addiction. Oh, and keep an eye out for the star of Henenlotter's first film Basket Case in a subway scene."
3,funny until the ending...,"We found the movie rather funny. I was told it was a commentary on drug usage which is plausable considering the things the lead actor goes through: loosing girlfriend, moving to delapidated apartment, withdrawls and ect. The parasite attached to his body which injects him with the drug. I think his name was Alymer was rather cute and his banter was what we found funny. It was different to see the effects the drug had on the elderly couple. We don't see alot of elderly ""grandparent"" looking couples addicted to drugs. However, we did not care for the ending. We thought the ending was lame. We were confused with all the electric currents shooting all over."
4,Great film.,"This one is about a worm like parasite named Aylmer (pronounced Elmer) that injects people with a kind of drug ""juice,"" but in order to deliver the ""juice"" the subjects have to help Aylmer obtain human brains. After the character Brian realizes that Aylmer is eating human brains while he(Brian) is high, he tries to stop taking the ""juice."" However, this is a lot harder than he thinks as his body begins to unergo withdrawal. Brian is left with no other choice but to help Aylmer get what he wants in exchange for the ""juice."" If you can find this movie I highly recommend it. It has gone out of print, but if you do a search some places still carry it for a reasonble price."
4,This Movie will blow your mind!,"I must of been out of my head to buy this movie, but I gave it a chance anyway, and I must admit that its not that bad, there is plenty of gore, the effects are above average and the dvd quality is excellent. unfortunately the film runs out of steam quite early on, however it will keep you guessing till the very disturbing end. I have given it 4 stars for the very experience, the vast amount of gore and some of the worst acting ever put to film. In my opinion you could do far worse, but at the same time you could do far better."
1,Worst movie EVAR!,"I love bad cheesy movies (see 'The Stuff'), but this has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Mind you, I *did* make it through the whole thing so I guess something made me keep watching. Maybe it was hope that it would get better."
1,DownRok,"Yeah, I saw this picture during the Dane Tour 2000. Its about some freakish little alien that looks like a cartoon.The alien is named Elmo and he feeds on brains or something. People let the little parasite feed on them because elmo gives them an addictive hallucinogen. In the end the main character gets over sauced with the crazy drug and starts firing Corona Beams out of his head.(see cover)"
4,LSD has nothing on Elmer!!,"Holy cow where do I begin? Not to rehash what others have said here I can pretty much agree with all the positive reviewers and just add my two cents. The first time I saw this I believe was on HBO where I had taped it. I was immediately blown away, confused and like ""What the?"" - SO I invited some friends over to watch this one night. This was back in the 80s when we all smoked and drank -anyway a bunch of us were sitting around my TV watching this, laughing ourselves sick when another person I knew stopped by. He came in on the middle of it and couldn't understand why this room full of people were laughinig so much at this movie. I guess you had to be there, but it was a lot of fun. Brain Damage is one of those movies you just have to enjoy and not think too much about."
5,"Politics, Suspense, Intrigue...What more could you want?","This novel successfully crosses genres, and is filled with drama, mystery, romance & intrigue. The science fictional elements come into play only late in the story yet are integral in making all the various story lines come together. The use of astrology throughout the book is represented in terms and language that are completely accessible to the layman, yet are done with the thoroughness of one who is an expert in the field. The debate between science versus astrology is approached through the protagonist's personal relationship as well as her credibility to the public at large. And Barbara Shafferman is likely to expand a few minds along the way. This is a ""must read"" for all and is a fine first novel for the author. Highly Recommended."
2,NO Personality,"""Skywriting"" was well written. However, Jane's personal struggle with depression sounded as exciting as watching paint dry. Maybe it is just me, but I feel there was something missing, like she wasn't really spilling her gut feelings. I felt Pauley was still very protective of sharing her feelings. She seems like a nice person with a deep desire to protect herself as well as others for fear of some type of criticism. I plowed through it with hopes of learning something, but it never happened."
2,*Could* have been good...,"The Introduction was so excellent; deep, complex, intelligent, and meaningful. But the rest of the book never matched its tone or quality. I kept waiting for the point, the meat of the personal discoveries, but they didn't come. For example, references to how Jane and her sister would only realize later how deeply certain parental aspects affected them, but never actually telling us about the revelation! So frustrating. And as someone working on memoir myself, it seems the book needed the hand of a good editor to help with flow, transitions, and theme. The raw material was there, but hard to follow."
1,Very Disappointing,"I read Skywriting to gain insight about the bipolar disorder, learn more about Jane Pauley's media career, her co-workers, the fascinating people she has met and perhaps some personal anecdotes about her husband, Garry Trudeau. It did not happen.Skywriting is uninformative, disjointed therapy writing.The only redeeming value of the book is the few pages near the end where Ms. Pauley writes about the final years of her parents as they aged and passed on.Giving this book one star is generous."
1,Yawn -- boring and bland,"I don't know what the point of this book was. Although it does give the reader a sense of her midwestern background, the book is very lackluster. I kept reading, waiting for some drama, some insight, something interesting!!! ... but it never came. Can Jane be that boring?"
1,Don't Bother!,"I now realise why it was I could not remember this movie, other than the title at the dollar movies, (Low-riders Heartbreakers).The only thing worth watching in this movie are the cars, when they cruise down the boulevard in their RANFLAS brings back so many memories. I remember hanging out watching the cars hop, scrape, and dance.This movie just drags, and the music is bad. The people in charge of the music should have had their head examined, there was just no research. No oldies, no disco, no soul, not even a spanish song! just a generic rip off of Blondies Rapture and some other c-r-a-p, even their generic wannabe jazz is bad.If you have to watch this rent it, or borrow it. If you must have it i'll sell you my copy cheep.Watch Boulevard Nights, American Me, Bound By Honor, Mi vida Loca, A million To Juan, Mi Familia, Zoot Suit, all these movies have better stories and plots.Another movie to stay away from is Lowrider Weekend."
3,Beautifully campy,"That's what this movie was, and it was entirely underrated. I hope that society will resurrect it sometime in the near future and revere it for the so-bad-it's-good movie that it is. Yes, as far as social commentary goes, the movie could have gone further. But unlike a lot of other movies out there that are just plain terrible, this one has the admirable quality of missing the mark but actually still being entertaining and, dare I say it, classic in its own right."
1,An AWFUL movie!,"This could be one of the worst movies I ever purchased. I have an extensive collection of movies, but would not enter this into my collection. (I donated it to the local library book store - some other pour soul will probably only have to spend a dollar or two for it, then burn it.)"
1,Not worth seeing..,"I thought this was gonna be a really funny, really good movie...but it just wasn't. Damon Wayans totally missed the mark and Lisa Kudrow just wasn't able to make it laugh. This movie you could easily skip...it's a stupid story about trying to get (an untalented) rapper to change who he is and show that he's not a threat to the kids, and Kudrow, who plays the daughter of the rich man who owns the record label that Wayans's character is associated with, just doesn't really deliver the kind of performance I thought she would. Basically this movie is something you can skip. Stupid storyline, dumb character, and not-so-good acting..I don't know about Damon Wayans but I do love Lisa Kudrow. If you want a great, funny performance by Kudrow, check out the movie ""Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion"", it's way better than this movie."
2,Damon Wayans missed the mark,"I'm very happy I did not pay $8.75 to see this movie in theaters. The movie is one of those you watch when you have nothing better to do, and want to burn some brain cells. There were some moments you can't help but laugh at. Overall the movie is just okay, it's not grab your sides, and fall on the floor laugh, but there were some funny moments."
2,Not so good,"I was really disapointed with this movie, it had some funny moments but not enough. The cast of this movie is far too talented to have participated in this project, I feel bad for them. I had to stop this movie after trying really hard to stick with it, but as soon as my gitlfriend fell asleep I lost my final bit of motivation to keep watching."
3,The Hi-Line,"If you are a Rachel Leigh Cook fan this movie is great. The movie is an interesting, somewhat, unique story. Rachel Leigh Cook is by far the best part of the film. I think she shines in this DVD and her role, in the film, is really the only real reason to purchase the DVD. If you are a Rachel fan the DVD is worth purchasing. The movie is interesting and the DVD extras are very nice, especially the interview conducted, with Rachel, regarding her character in the film."
4,The Hi-Line,"This is a delicate and subtle character-driven movie, which makes it a very good showcase for Rachel Leigh Cook. It's great to see her successfully explore a role with a wider and more complex range than Hollywood has allowed her. That's what indies are for, I suppose. It's beautifully shot, and has a tricky and understated plot. No car crashes or nude scenes, but a film well worth watching."
4,The Ceiling is Listening,"In one of Arthur Miller's more obscure works, he explores government limitations placed on a group of writers behind the Iron Curtain. The drama begins with the offstage seizure of a Russian novelist's manuscript by the KGB.Adrain, a visiting American writer, is alarmed by the seizure of Sigmund's novel and urges his colleague to seek asylum in the United States. Maya is the voice of reason yet she resides in the very problematic building that records the group's conversations.Motivations and affiliations are clouded as the story evolves. When the manuscript is returned to Sigmund, resolutions still seems to ellude the writers. I am not certain what to make from this work since I had difficulty digesting what I found to be a clunky ending. Regardless, the story is an interesting concept."
4,For Anne's fans and scholars,"Dr. Irene Gammel's newest book, The Intimate Life of L.M. Montgomery. The Intimate Life is a collection of essays based in part on the Institute's 2002 conference on life writing. It contains essays by known Montgomery scholars such as Epperly, Gammel, Rubio, and Waterston tha examine closely the author's examples of life writing so as to shed light on the private side of this enigmatic lady. The book also includes a secret diary penned jointly by Montgomery and her friend, Nora Lefurgey, during the period of January 1903 to June 1903. This diary shows the humourous, fun, and playful side of Montgomery as the two women recount some of tales of their schemes and flirtations."
5,Outstanding political humor,"This is truly a tour de force in political humor with an occasional serious note. Be sure to order both ""Sing along with the Democrats"" and ""Sing along with the Republicans."" They are set to traditional songs, with a production quality that is absolutely first class and professional. Part of the fun is in reading the insert included. I first listened to them after a very difficult day at work; it definitely made my evening. They make excellent gifts. Consider sending a set to your senators and representative, governor, etc."
5,Kim's lovely new single.,"I bought this cd for the Pulsedriver Vs. Beam remix(7:11) and it didn't disappoint at all. The song finds Ms. Wilde in great form and this song is too good. This is from Best Of collection and the remix is Euro/trance all the way. By the end of this mix you will be singing ""You are loved, you are loved "" over and over again in you head. Too catchy!"
5,Finding the courage to make your daydreams come true...,"Fifteen-year-old Barbara Perry has vivid daydreams about the way she wants her life to be, from becoming friends with the ""right"" people to having a certain boy ask her out. None of these things seem to come true, however...because Barbara is too busy daydreaming to actually take action in the moment.Part of the problem is shyness; another part is Barbara's typical adolescent fear that no one will like her real self. But, after a series of missteps and revelations, Barbara finally makes things start happening...instead of simply waiting around for them to happen to *her.*"
2,doctoring needed,The replacement strap I ordered for our recumbent bike worked only with some doctoring. It immediately snapped apart and my husband had to drill holes in our pedal to attach. It will work for right now but will order directly from our bike company from now on.
2,It is Ok but charts in DVD are barely readable,"The DVD attempts to present the most important metrics to use in Agile. There are several useful metrics, but it does not present some key detailed calculations to properly use them. It could have three stars but the charts and numbers in video are barely readable. It would have been so much better to include the original supporting spreadsheets. Additionally there is background noise and announcements of people joining this workshop. I would have not bought the book had I known these details."
3,The Last Days of John Lennon. Fact or Fiction??,"Having read this book twice now, it becomes more interesting yet more questionable. First of all, contrary to what he claims in the book it is very obvious that Fred Seaman (the author and assistant to John Lennon) had the intentions of writing a tell-all book of his days with the Lennons right from the day he was hired. The details in this book are quite astonishing and could only have come from his personal day-to-day diaries. The reading is easy and informative but it's hard to separate fact from fiction at times especially since he issued a statement in 2002 retracting alot of what he said in this book to be true and apologized to Yoko Ono after being sued by her. It seriously damages the credibility of this book. However, I do think alot of the details are true but take his thoughts and opinions with a grain of salt!"
4,Worth the time to read,I almost closed the book when the first acknowledgement was to Albert Goldman but I kept reading. There is some of the same type of informtion contained in Goldman's book (which I threw away) but there is also some cherished moments-specifically the chapters on Bermuda and the Hit Factory when John's creativity resurfaced.Hopefully we can all soon read the sequel: The Last Days of Mark David Chapman.
3,Good,"Technically, this book is good. I mean, wow, Fred Seaman wrote (with such amazing detail) and kept and collected everything what should have been very private about John Lennon , including John's shopping lists. That guy knew what to do from the start (since he was hired as john's assitant) just for his own good (in my opinion). Well, this is really a sellout. John, wherever he is now, will surely be [mad].(Positive side, though: this book shows that Yoko wasn't what I thought she seems [or seemed])"
2,"Sorry, This is NOT A Good Record !!","The Studio stuff is lame at best and really sounds totally unispired. The live stuff, although its rocks good and hard, is simply not a good sounding recording. Too bad !! For live Humble Pie, Stick with The Fillmore or the King Biscuit."
5,Still as strong as ever,"I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Season 3 was at least as strong as Season 2, if not stronger, which is quite a feat of writing.Duchovny is masterful throughout, and his stunning chemistry with his screen muse Karen, is the cornerstone of what has been an unparalleled series.Yep, it's strictly adult entertainment, and it needs to be seen as, to paraphrase the beautiful Embeth Davidtz, a mockumetary of the crazy, no-consequence LA life that it is portraying. The show, from the beginning, has been a parody of itself, but it works.As we go into Season 4, Hank will be facing some major challenges, partly due to his poor, reactive handling of the Mia situation in the Season 3 finale.Interesting times ahead."
5,Censorship Issue is Over,"Whatevr people saw that was censored, its not censored anymore. Great show! Season three is still good -- though not quite as good as 1 and 2."
4,Best Season so far,"If you only watch one series, Californication has to be it. A smart comedy about a down on his luck author Hank Moody (David Duchovny) who continues to get the runaround from his girlfriend/mother of his daughter Karen and his daughter Becca, both of whom he is crazy in love with. Unfortunately for Hank, he has a habit of being irresistible to the opposite sex which gets him into constant trouble. I was a little disappointed in Karen this season. She is starting to get on my nerves by blowing everything Hank does out of proportion, yet when he tried to propose to her, she shot him down. Will someone tell her to make up her friggin' mind already"
4,"Ballad of a (very) hard man.....,","By my reckoning, Hank fornicates on average at least5 times a week with different women.I just hope he has stocks of anti-biotics.Great fun!"
2,Season Wasted,"I enjoyed the first two seasons, but season 3 of Californication can easily be skipped. It's like being stuck on the last groove of an LP, it's going no where - and becomes annoying quickly. The worst thing about the series is the horrible duaghter whose shrill tone and off-dialogue analysis reminds one of the many uses of a bath tub, and an editor."
2,"Probably the last season, or it should be","As a big fan of the series, it's very disappointing too see how quickly it has lost its plot and turned itself into a mindless orgy that is unconvincing and tiring. Gone is the sexual chemistry and tension between Hand Moody and his harem. Instead, he lurches from one boring sexual conquest to another without the freshness of his wits that made series 1 and 2 so enjoyable.Perhaps Hank Moody is still the same and I am the one growing up, but after watching series 3, I feel Hank Moody is an old dog who has no more new tricks. Other characters, such as Moody's agent, also become irritatingly unconvincing and irrelevant. I don't think this series will last too much longer."
1,Unwatchable- this show makes me weep for society,"Full disclosure- I have watched the prior seasons of this show, and found it somewhat entertaining, if unrealistic. This season though, is totally unwatchable. The show has become a sad caricature of itself and is so offensive I stopped watching after two episodes. It is now an adolescent boy's fastasy of a world where women enjoy being raped, it's okay for teachers to screw their students, and the law of cause and effect does not exist. I hated it so much that I will never watch this show again."
5,Never lets down,"The third season brings just as much entertainment as the first two seasons. DD is his normal self at first, but then starts an enormous transformational process. The season finale is one of the best of any show I've ever seen. I just ordered season 4 to make sure I see how it all pans out."
1,Stopped watching after 1 minute,I'v seen more skin and swear words on network tv. This is not worth watching in its censored form with half the screen fuzzed out.
1,Mutilatd by censorship,"I love Californication. However if the first thing you see after the Review of last season is a big blob with a head then something is wrong!I need an account and a credit card to use this service but still I have to take up with this unreasonable amount of editing!Please put a huge ""CENSORED"" up on the cover next time so that I won't waste my time and bandwidth with something like that!"
2,Disappointed,Maybe because the first two seasons set the bar impossibly high? Season one was a complete surprise that kept my wife and I laughing and season two a better surprise because of its risk taking and dark ending. Season three I found not very deep/substative and many episodes rather boring. Maybe my expectations for season three were too high? The only episode I truly liked in season three was the last one. Maybe because it connected so much with the past seasons? Waiting for season four and hoping it surprises me in a good way.
2,Not Worth It,"This appliance reminds me of why it's never a good idea to save $20 and go for the cheaper one.Let me start by saying that it is very short, leaving no room to reach your hand in to do anything without burning yourself. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, with a removable tray, but this tray will not budge. The entire thing heats up to an untouchable temperature on the OUTSIDE, so don't even think of trying to pull out that tray for at least half an hour. It toasts very unevenly, turns a bright pulsing orange inside which is just weird, and to top it all of the door is now not shutting tightly.It receives an extra star for working and not bursting into flames... yet."
2,I burn myself EVERY day on this toaster oven,"Very Unsafe!although it toasts fine, the outside (including the handle)gets extremely hot and it's virtually impossibleto retrieve your food without getting burned.if you choose to buy this you should alsoinvest in a good burn cream-you will need it for yourfingers!"
4,It does what it says,"There's a big sticker on the top of the oven WARNING that it gets hot. For it's size and capacity it functions well, especially for warming and cooking small portions."
2,Do Not Waste Your Money,"Nice looking and cleans up well but...This oven takes forever to heat up, make toast, and after a dozen uses the timer knob broke off when barely tapped by the tea kettle. Very cheezy brittle plastic knob. Yes, you will get burned if you touch the outside of the oven so be careful. I put an oven thermometer in it and it only reached 325 degrees after 45 minutes.There's no taking it back at this point, but you should look at kitchenaide. My daughter has one and it's quick to heat up and toast."
1,Timer doesn't work,"I bought this cute little toaster oven because my old standby stopped working. This is one HUGE disappointment. Not only does it get super hot on the outside, but my unit came with a timer that didn't work! I should have learned my lesson when I tried it a few times, but kept hoping it was just me and not the unit. This morning I put two pieces of toast in, on the middle (light) setting, and before I knew it, the house was full of smoke and the timer hadn't budged. The toast was burned beyond recognition and about to catch fire. I'm returning it to the company because it is a piece of crap and I hope the replacement is not the same model. If it is, I'm going to call back and talk to a manager and get a different one."
1,Don't waste your money,"Very slow to heat up and cooking anything takes at least 2X longer than it's supposed to. Example: a frozen pizza takes 25 minutes instead of 10-12. We had this for about 18 months when it died. The timer(also the on/off switch)went bad. It's impossible to find this part, since it's made and distributed in China, so it's now going into the garbage."
1,"Emerson TOR49 ""toaster"" oven",This little oven makes the old Easy Bake oven look like a powerhouse. The Emerson TOR49 is a complete piece of junk. It can't even toast bread!? How can they get away with selling such garbage? DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.
2,toasts unevenly but burns fingers consistently,"This is clearly a product that has never been user-tested before going on the market, but I suppose ""you get what you pay for"". It's an affordable oven, not too ugly, and does an OK job. The primary annoying bit is the door handle and surfaces... they are a consistent source of finger burns (I now leave the door open after taking the food out and close it later in the day). The second equally annoying bit is the uneven toasting... if you don't turn your toast over and 180 degrees, it will burn on one end. You definitely need to monitor your food in this oven, especially since the toast settings on the knob are meaningless. And yes, the whole thing gets hot, but that's an easier annoyance to avoid. This toaster is essentially one step up from heating your food over an open flame."
1,danger - fire hazard,"this little beast burns your bread, your fingers and anything that falls onto the floor of the oven bursts in high flames. this is dangerous as well as disfunctional and is so bad it should go to the trash rather than the charity rummage sale. i hope amazon reads all the comments on this page and decides not to carry the product anymore.[BY THE WAY...I DID NOT BUY THIS THRU AMAZON]"
1,NOT worth the money,"We bought this to replace an old cheap toaster oven, and we loved the idea of having a rotisserie! Worked great the first 3-4 times... not anymore!- If you don't get your 5 lb. chicken (largest that you can use according to the directions) EXACTLY centered and weight balanced, it will not turn.- Don't even bother trying to make TOAST in this oven... it takes 10+ minutes.- The racks are annoying- the 'toast' rack falls out and drops your toast if you slide it more than a couple inches out of the oven.- The convection fan was noisy from the first time we turned it on.We've had this product for a few months now, and I am NOT IMPRESSED. BIG waste of money. :("
1,Piece of junk,"Don't buy this toaster oven! Timing controls are confusing and very hard to get right. One day my toast is undercooked, the next day it's burnt, and it's always cooked unevenly. The oven/toaster often doesn't turn off when the timer dings, burning the food. The heat doesn't shut off when the door opens, and the tray doesn't slide out when the door opens, causing burns. It gets incredibly hot on top too, which is dangerous. Mine's going to the dump. I'd give it zero stars if possible."
2,Noisy fan gets worse with time.,"We bought this toaster oven in a local store and had it about a year. Looks good on the counter top, and it appears to be a well built appliance, but when we started using it, we realized that it is not built very well. The convection fan was too noisy from day one -- it sounded like it was low quality China-made junk, which it apparently is. The control knobs do not work in some positions (noisy fan running, but producing no heat) so we learned which knob positions do work and have been using those settings. The oven still works, but the fan has gotten so noisy that we are now looking for a new one. We will scrap this one."
2,"please, kill this series!","I fell asleep....If you want to see a little T&A;, then this might be for you (then again why not rent a porno?)If you want to see a horror movie, then this falls right into the roger corman generic, no story line, bad FX horror movies...I gave it one star for the lead girls roll, and the fact that there is 100's of worse horror movies than this. The problem is, there is 1000's better than this"
1,"Bad, really really bad.","Oh dear, how can I begin to describe how bad Species III is? Umm... oh dear. Please do yourselves a favour, if you liked either of the first two and are curious to see how the ""story"" pans out... just DON'T. Truly, truly awful."
2,Can Somebody Pass the Cheese...,"OK, here we go again! Not bad for direct to video, but not nearly as good as the first. I get the sense a TV show may be coming, lets hope not. Unrated features lots more nudity and gore than seen on Sci-Fi channel. Acting is cheesy, creatures are cheesy, set design is cheesy, but so was the 2nd installment. If you have the first 2, then you do need part 3 to complete your set. Just sit back, grab some pizza for all that cheese, and enjoy."
4,Best of the series,This is the best of the trilogy. I believe this is a straight to video release but it is better than the usual of its ilk. The main reason being Ameilia Cooke's gas station scene.....
3,Decent Grade B popcorn movie,"Reminiscent of 50's sci-fi in that whomever wrote the script obviously drinks a lot, the acting doesn't always fit the scene being viewed, and there's a tendency to go right to T&A to keep you from noticing, which is fine by me, but I notice it anyway. The movie is pretty good visual look to it and the direction is adequate. However, the ending is nothing more than giving up for lack of anything better to do. As in, ""I don't know what to do here so somebody better start walking off into the sunset""."
2,Feh...,"Yeah, Species 3 has a hoochie and some decent blood and gore but it turns into a silly mess. This 3rd volume in the Species series is the cheapest of the three films and it shows.The plot of Species 3 centers around a crazy scientist who thinks growing planet-devouring alien monsters is a good idea. He ropes another dope into his scheme and they take turns cleaning up after the half monster/half hoochie.If you are really curious, then I guess you should buy this film but you will be disappointed."
3,A So so movie,"This movie is a so so movie. The acting, and the plot is terrible. The only good thing is that there is some nudity in it."
1,Don't even bother!,"This movie is nothing but cheap porn, don't bother its just an excuse to show off some ugly chicks boobs and just focuses on the straight male's want to see a naked woman. Anyone a fan of boys? Forget this movie completely. Trust me. You'll feel alot better and probably live longer ignoring this stupid, crap movie."
3,Not bad,"Considering it was a Sci-Fi channel movie that went right to DVD, it was good. Based off the 1st and 2nd film, it was horrible. This is a good movie to watch when you do not want to think and are rather tired and might fall asleep. Hot woman in it. (Parents - there is a great deal of nudity so be aware if watching with children.)"
4,best one yet.,species 3 is the best in the series. sexy and exciting and with a great story. cant wait for number 4.
1,Story line missed the mark,Not good. I and II were very good and married into to each other very well. This was a B rated movie at best and they are trying to bring in low cost actors to continue to the run. Do not watch. And please do not let there be a IV.
3,Start here and work backwards for the Species series,"This is not the best or the worst sci fi movie I've ever seen. It is a continuation of the series - which consists of three loosely connected stories about an alien strain of DNA and experiments in blending it with human DNA. As you would expect, the results are not good for humans. Lots of scientific babble and semi-ethical conundrums. Since the stories have only the flimsiest connection, there is little to worry about in watching these backwards. The payoff is seeing the first one last. Your experience only improves in this direction."
3,"Great Performance, Poor Sound Quality",[5 Stars Performance + 1 Star Sound Quality] / 2 = 3 Stars AlbumCould somebody please improve the sound and re-release?
3,cracked again,"When I received my table it too was cracked down the middle of the table top. It was not a little crack either, it went all the way through the thickness of the table. 2 of the chairs had huge chunks missing out of them as well. the people at target were very nice when I called for an exchange."
3,Arrived slightly damaged due to inadequate packaging,"Target ships this in the manufacturers packaging, which is inadequate for the rough ride on Fedex ground. The box is about 150lbs and the contents take a beating. As a result the corners were slightly damaged when it arrived... not too bad, but you do not want to get damaged brand new goods. The set is of fair quality - all wood and strong when assembled properly. Make sure you do not tighten the screws and nuts before you sit on the chairs once or they will not balance perfectly. Only after you sit on them and all legs touch the ground should you tighten everything. Those who say the parts do not fit properly have probably not followed this advice. I think the set is well worth the price."
1,piece of junk,I got the dining room set a little over a month ago. The table and chairs are falling apart on me already. The table and chairs shake
3,"bad service, decent table",... it's a nice table and i like it ... the pieces don't exactly fit perfectly together.
4,"Good solid set, especially for the price","This table and chair set is exactly what I wanted. It's attractive, easy to put together and solid. I'm very happy with it. Toss in the price, and you can't beat it. ... In my case, the package arrived and I found a crack in the tabletop, as well as one of the chair legs. ... the end result is a great dining set and a great price."
5,"Great Value, Sturdy Set","This arrived very quickly, triple boxed. Assembly was easy, most of it was already done. The wood is just beautiful, natural, with all kinds of interesting variations. The set is very sturdy and should last a long time, even in daily use. ... If you want a really nice, sturdy, simple set, for a fantastic price, this is it."
4,great furniture.,"I have 2 chairs with uneven legs (I fasten it while my wife sitting on it. so it was adjusted evenly as much as possible, they just didn't cut it even at the factory) that's about my only complaints except the damage it took during the shipping (4 corners of the table got grinded and chiped out)it's leaps and bounds upgrade from ikea furnitures. that's for sure. better material, better finish. highly recommmand it."
3,"Pretty Set, Missing Hardware...????","I have purchased many items from the Target collection to match this. This set arrived without any type of hardware and two of the chair legs were missing. After numerous attempts to contact them for replacement, I have given up. On the plus side, it is a very attractive set, sturdy and at a good price. It matches all the other pieces we have purchased during the past year. However, Target's lack of assistance (especially considering we purchased $1200+ from them in furniture alone) has been a real let down. While most places are competing for your dollars, Target just lets our emails go unanswered. But again, this furniture is a real good buy, what we have we really, really like. Just wish their customer service was better."
5,"Great Set, Awesome Customer Service","This set is beautiful. Heavy, natural wood, love the color and the weight. Since purchasing this set, have filled my home with this line from Target.com. There was a problem with this set, out of twenty-something purchases, this was the one and only. The hardware and two legs were missing. Target could not send the replacement parts, so they are sending another entire set (at no charge) so we can pick out what is needed to complete our set, then they will have the extra set picked up. Is that not absolutely awesome. Unfortunately, this type of customer service is all too rare. So buy with complete confidence, not only is the quality and workmanship great, but you have the support if you need it."
1,A disappoitment,"It looks so beautiful & it is , however the box was damaged in shipping also - which did affect the product - 2 of the chairs have broken the same way as stated in another comment by falling less than a foot off of the groud the over all quality seems to be poor when it comes to the set up - the wood on the table top itself was split & cracked at delivery. ..."
4,Robbie's Return,"After his departure from Take That, Robbie Williams was back on his feet and hit it big on his own with hits like Millenium and Angel. Although he had massive hits worldwide, he was absent in the U.S. shelves. He had two albums overseas that sold big, but many people thought he was over with in America. With his latest song Feel, he proves that he isn't out without a doubt. The song has a vibe that is similar to several songs that Elton John recorded, and a strong vocal impression to go with it. The song just sometimes comes as a shocker, when everything else is overdubbed like Eminem, and Nelly. If you really want to hear a real ""Bad Boy"", I suggest you listen to Robbie Williams."
1,Title Only - No Text,"This ""book"" is simply a list of titles for poems by the author, no text is included. Amy Lowell may write good poetry, but you will have to look elsewhere to read it."
2,Bathroom book,"This is OK as a bathroom book -- it's full of very short blurbs on various science topics, inventors, and discoveries.It is pretty good as a jumping-off point -- if you have a vague curiosity about something, this book can help direct your next google search.This is not good enough for use in a home school curriculum; I suspect most homeschoolers would do a better job on these topics.FWIW, this author is a True! Believer! in man-made climate change, all evidence to the contrary not withstanding. There is delicious irony on pages 276 - 280 as we learn about (first) environmental destruction (The! World! Is! Dying! and! It's! Your! Fault!), and then transition on the next page into ""the blight of bad science,"" with this warning: ""stifle the spirit of enquiry, and you can bring scientific progress to a halt..."" Delicious.The author has also written a book on Darwin, and saves a little venom for creation-minded people.Anyway, good book for the shelf in the bathroom. Enjoyable!"
3,okay..,"I thought this book had a really great plot.. but the writeing seemed sloppy, also some of it seemed very unreal, i liked how she made her be reincarnated.. but after so many years, they'd come back looking for there lost son? i mean he's dead, we all knew it. How couldn't they know that? i think the author made the charaters look stuipidNice try though.."
2,OK,"Roughnan has written a very functional thriller, with the usual and expected thriller twists and turns. Roughnan doesn't veer away from the 'thriller' formula, which makes following the plot pedestrian."
5,A fantastic book!,This book is terrific. It is well-written and fast moving. Roughan somehow manages to make the reader empathize with a main character whose conduct cannot be excused. The book starts with a nice pace and continues to pick up right through the wholly unexpected ending. Great stuff. I hope there's a sequel.
5,Fast Paced,"Mr. Roughan, where have you been?A truly fast paced action book with all the elements of intrigue and mystery.I enjoyed this very much.Please keep writing.The ending should not have been a surprise, however, it was!"
5,GIVES A REAL FEEL FOR LIFE IN NYC IN THE 1990's,"This book is excellent. Mr. roughan articulates what it was like to live in the fast paced (and anything goes) manhattan of the 1990's. He masterly accomplishes this through wit, insight and a keen observation of how the up-and-comers of that era lived life (and how the booming economy could turn a seemingly normal guy into a....READ THIS BOOK TO FIND OUT!)heartily recommended."
2,to complex,Buy Vedic Mathematics Made Easy by Dhaval Bathia. much easier fun to read and understand.
4,An Inspiring Saga,"This movie is an incredible story of faith in the midst of persecution. I think it is a ""must-see"" for Christians in America, because we can too easily take our religious freedom for granted. I highly recommend this movie!"
2,Dissapointed,Movie included sensual scenes in it not for children. Story focuses too much on non-biblical themes. I do not recommend this movie.
1,It's Only Missing God,"God is almost completely absent from this film, which, you'll have to admit is pretty weird. There were also two or three really uncomfortable sex scenes. No nudity, but still painfully uncomfortable to watch with the family. One especially where her husband threw her on the bed then pushed her head aside and said ""Don't look at me.""The acting, writing, directing were Ok, but when you see a christian film, you hope to see something that focuses on God.Definately recommend you skip this one."
3,Based on a true story,The acting is great. And Julia Nickson-Sole is convincing as Sung.As a result of the Japanese invasion of China a wealthy family is displaced from their home and divested of their servants. The Commie replacement government was not very sympathetic toward this type of family either.Now we see what is happening in degrees as she phased out of her cushy surroundings. She actually tries to comply with the new environment and approves of it.Then the government helps her to learn about the Christianity by accusing her of going to a Christian school as a child. She tries to explain that she only went to the school and that did not make her Christian. The unbending government makes her suffer until in her confusion she turns to Christianity in hopes of a cure for the situation.Bamboo Saucer [VHS]
3,China Cry,"After reading the book, the movie was a disappointment because they focused on such a short period of her life. It isn't up the standards of The Hiding Place even though it was made by the same producer, but it is worth watching and owning."
4,Not exactly a best of but still very good,"Ok, I love FLC, so I may be bias on my review. Anyway, I was expecting kind of a best of, but this cd is filled with strange stuff as well. well known hits in here, like Korean Bodega or 10th Street, but also some less known wonders like Half a Block, Up on the hill and an amazing version of Scooby Snacks in true Mafioso style (very cool indeed for FLC fans). So you won't find songs like King of New York (one of my favs), Loco, Big Night Out and such... Still it's a very good buy for fans."
1,Couldn't buy into,"his arguments. Tough to follow all of the points he was trying to make. Couldn't believe the length of the 3 forward's. I was expecting a lot more considering the build up. I had just read the Affluent Society and was blown away by it, so this was a major let down."
4,Sorry reviewer from LA,"Sorry reviewer from LA, but at least the previous reviewer who you were surprised could write well spelled Riesman's name correctly....oops! Guess we all have our strengths and weaknesses"
1,The Lonely Crowd,"I received a novelty: A book without text!!!!!!!!!!!! Completely blank, except for the front and back cover"
2,"A thought-provoking, though painful read!","Although the thesis of this book is thought-provoking, the language in which it is written is dull and disengaging. The author uses many references to books and films from the early part of the 20th century, which not many people are familiar with today,and this definitely detracts from the book's quality. Also, the entire book could have been compressed into 100 pages--the same thing is repeated over and over again in different words!"
1,WRONG!!!,What was pictured when I bought this dude diaper bag was NOT what came in the mail. I had to return it.
2,Very Outdated,"I bought this dictionary recently as a reference for an ASL class I'm taking. Unfortunately, many signs are missing or have changed in the past decade or two since this was created. Technically, however, this is a fine resource. The illustrations are well done and cross referencing is simple. Just know that you'll want to seek out a newer and or more exhaustive edition."
4,"Great book, full of most everyday signs.","Though this book is lacking in some signs, for the most part, it has every sign I could use. My daughter has a speech disorder, and I love that this book is so easy to use. The pictures explain what the sign is and how to use it. I'd definitely recommend this book to others."
5,Very nice!,Very nice ligth! I love it! Gives an special oriental touch to my bed room. Not very strong.
5,Perhaps their best album...,"Aggressive Measures is a claasic slab of brutal death metal. While I'm not the biggest fan of the dutch scene, this is one of my favorite death metal bands ever. While a slightly different approach from their first 3 records, the music is faster with a bit more technical prowess involved, the grooves are heavier, and Eric's (one time vocalist for Severe Torture) growls are menacing. The bass guitar is really low in the mix, but I guess it's better that way since keeping the bass down preserves the clarity of the guitar riffs. Buy this and you will NOT be disappointed."
3,something in the name,"My dad bought me this cd when i was in high school. My last name is Dingledy and everyone called me ""Dingle."" I can't say that this is by any standards a great album. At first listen is sounds like a bunch of drunk guys playing around on any instrument they can find. But once you get a few plays under your belt, you'll be amused by their quirky lyrics (i wrote my name in the snow/a place where nothing will grow), sentimentality (you called us, you wrote us, we moved but you found us), and insight (sometimes i drink a lot, sometimes its all i've got). You'll even come around on their musical vision. A must have for anyone named Dingledy."
3,"96K, not a full DVD-A","this is undoubtedly one of the best jazz recordings of all time, but this title is not a full DVD-A. it is a two-channel, 24 Bit, 96kHz DVD-A and as such only explores half the possibilities of the format. Even so, it sounds TWICE as good as the CD, which i also have, and i regularly use this as a comparison for people who doubt the power of 24 bits.So if you are a coltrane fan, this is about the best recording you can have - but if you are a patient man my advice would be to wait for the full 192 kHz version which will undoubtedly be released in the future."
1,Excellent Performance but Very Poor Quality Audio,"I bought this DVD based on the other anonymous review here and was very surprised to find the audio quality to be mediocre. Apparently, the original recording was processed to remove analog tape noise. You can here the noise modulation at times on the horns and other instruments. More disturbing is the constricted, non-dynamic sound. Most CD's sound far superior ! Do not waste your money on this version, buy the regular CD instead if you want this excellent performance. BTW, I am using high-end equipment (Mark Levinson, Audio Research, Martin Logan)"
5,An amazing jazz album..........,this cd was amazing to listen to right from the start!'blue train' puts me in a mood where i can care less about life and just sit back and relax.....the rest of the album has the same feel to it.....so if you need a cd that will let you relax...then buy this cd...ultimately one of the best jazz albums of all time by one of the best!
5,a great record,this disc is simply brillant.the tones out of Mr. coltrane's horn leaves you in a daze.it's not as well known as some of his other titles but this is a must have asap.the band sounds great.prime time john coltrane.
4,Jazz classic,"This is simply a jazz classic. The songs and the playing come together for Coltrane in this album. A must-have for Coltrane, saxophone, or jazz fans."
5,Blue TRain Review,"If you are looking for some of John Coltranes best work, Blue Train Has to be one of them. Featuring Paul Chambers on Bass, and legend Philly Joe Jones on Drums makes this CD Special. Recomended for people who are into real jazz. Ejoyable 1-7 songs.Enjoy!!"
4,get the ECD version instead!!!,"Don't get me wrong: this CD is about the best ""cool jazz"" that's out there, and considering people have been trying unsuccessfully to top it for 40+ years, that's quite a feat. This is the kind of music that leaves a residue on you long after the songs are over, and while it's playing, you'll be humming, toe-tapping, finger-snapping, just in an all-around better mood. The style is good, the instrument balance is good, and Coltrane and Co. are technical maestros on their respective instruments.Having given this CD my highest recommendation, now let me say you should get the ECD version instead (an enhanced CD). Aside from the CD-ROM bonus material, you'll get two extra songs: alternate takes on ""Blue Train"" and ""Lady Bird"" that give you another 15 minutes or so worth of music. As they say, ""If you go, go all out."" If you're interested in this album (and I hope you are) you might as well go with the ""Deluxe Edition"" instead of this very basic version."
4,There's a better version,"For those who are considering buying this CD, there's a better version that you may consider getting instead of this one. That one is titled ""The Ultimate Blue Train"" (1997) with the same cover photo but contains all the tracks on this one plus two extra tracks which are alternate takes of ""Blue Train"" and ""Lazy Bird"". Thanks to SBM remastering, that other version also sounds much more lively than this one. ""The Ultimate Blue Train"" is also enhanced with multimedia which you can play on the PC with video as well. However, if you can't get ""The Ultimate Blue Train"", you should at least get this classic recording of John Coltrane without which no Jazz collection is complete. In fact, this ""Blue Train"" is already a very good one. It's only that ""The Ultimate Blue Train"" is even better."
5,Incredible Resource for Coltrane fans,"Even if you have Blue Train, as most fans do, this CD is worth buying for the pictures, audio tracks, and interviews included that give behind the scenes info on this historic session and thoughts on the genius of John Coltrane. I would love to see more CD's with information like this, they are well worth the extra $."
