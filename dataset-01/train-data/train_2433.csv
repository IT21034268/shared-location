4,Review,"Im not sure the question is how ""Less than Jake"" the new album is, some of you seem to be judging the album based on their older stuff, in which case you where always likely to be disappointed. However listening to the album for what it is, each song is highly listenable, and i for one can't wait to see them at leeds festival this year !!"
2,"Lacking Energy, Not enough horns.","After listening to less then jake for about 3 years now i have to say this CD is unlike anything i've ever heard from them. It's lacking in energy and i'm finding it very hard to really get into it. How is anyone expected to skank to something like ""The Rest Of My Life."" I fear that the worst has happened and LTJ has sold out to the emo crowd."
2,Psychological Regression?,"For those who kinda grew up listening to LTJ, it was nice listening to how much it sucked to be different, how much your parents sucked, and how no one understood you... However... 10 years later, I dunno about the rest of the fans, but as I approach 30, the same themes just don't really ring true. I guess for new fans still in their teens that still feel all angry and misunderstood it's an okay album. For me, though, I wonder how old we're all going to get before they start growing up with the rest of us... It's just sad to have to outgrow a band. I wonder how many of the songs are really written from the heart, and if they are, how many more times will they screw up before getting things right... Because, wow, being in your thirties and stil rather lost and ungrounded is kinda sad. But like I said, new fans, sure it's okay. But if you've been a fan for a while, just listen to the old records."
2,"Incredibly Dissapointing, What happened Vinnie?","I don't know man..right from the start when I first heard LTJ preview these songs online, I knew I was going to be incredible dissapointed with this album.One of the reviewers made a comment saying ""this album is great for any true Less Than Jake fan.""Wow, what a disgusting reply. This album is good on it's own, if you're a fan of some unfiltered pop/punk. But for Less Than Jake, there is absolutely no energy in this album. I know Anthem departed heavily from the Less Than Jake sound we all grew up to... but it still had enough energy to blow up a small town.The fact that JR and Buddy barely have any horn lines is incredibly dissapointing.Vinnie, you used to write the theme songs to my childhood.Now you're just writing songs for the masses.I'm sure you'll gain more fans...but thanks for dissapointing that kids that have been there with you for years."
2,Is this LTJ or Good Charlotte?,"This is worthless pop drivel compared to Borders & Boundaries, Hello Rockview, or Anthem. I would recommend all of those highly. This was such a disappointment- cheesy lyrics, all the energy of their previous work simply disappeared, their sound has changed dramatically."
1,What a Bomb!,"I bought this toy as Christmas gift for a granddaughter and it was such a disappointment! We were able to get it activated but it never responded to any commands. Anything that it did was totally random and it stopped working entirely after a few days. A cousin of this granddaughter also got this toy for Christmas and had even a worse experience than we did. Her first toy never worked and after it was returned, a second still did not do as well as the one that we purchased. The maker should be ashamed for marketing such a poor product."
3,Does not follow commands,"My son fell in love with this dog at the toy store.I thought fifty dollars seemed a little high for the dog,but my son had recieved gift cards for his third birthday.This dog does not follow any of the commands like it is suppose to.It does bark and do all it says,but at random.Being my son is three he is more than happy with it.But I could've purchased a dog like it for a lot less.I would not recomend this toy for any older children who are want to ""train it"""
3,it is fun... a little,"i got it 4 xmas, and its fun2 play with but its annoying when u have 2 say everything 3 times be4 he does it and if u have the slightest noise around, it wont work. its fun though"
4,"Loved, but not played with often.","My 5 year old absolutely loves the toy when she is using it, but doesn't take it out to play with often."
2,High Hopes,"My niece received a Scamps for Christmas last year and it never worked correctly right out of the box. It moved as it was supposed to but it never had a voice at all. In spite of that my daughter loved to play with it, so I decided to take a risk and buy her one for her birthday last week. Our Scamps worked perfectly and was awesome to play with... for aboout 20 minutes. My little girl barely got to play with him when he completely malfunctioned. Now we have a Scamps that tilts his head and whines once in awhile, but will not respond to any commands or even move half the time. And yes, I have tried changing the batteries. It is a huge disappointment that 2 out of 2 of this product doesn't work."
5,Purification of the heart.,"I'm about halfway in this book and I love it. It's easy to read, and it's right on it. Motivates and guides you to become a better person. It talks about the diseases of the heart and the treatments. I am glad I own this book. Every person should own it. The world would be a better place if everyone were to follow the advice from the book."
3,"A great book, but...........","Ok, Motley is not the greatest rock and roll band--they had a few good songs, but most will agree that the catalog is a bit thin, if not weak. The book is very good--yes Nikki is arrogant and Tommy is the quintessential dude, but overall, a very entertaining, explicit, raunchy fun fest. I don't think the editor did a damn thing really--everyone seems to say whatever the hell they want, and I even saw at least one mispelling. Not a great book---but a good one--not a great band, but a good one."
3,Morbid curiosity,"The essential message of The Dirt seems to be that excessive drugs, alcohol and sex will ruin your life, unless you are a member of a gritty, determined metal band, and then they will ruin you life, but you will be (in)famous. Reading the book could be equated to a mile-long car wreck on the side of the road involving everything from 18-wheelers to Mazeratis--you just can't not look at it.While the Pulitzer committee won't be calling anytime soon, the story is a fascinating one and benefits from being told by at least four independent points of view. Readers looking for scintillating tales of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll won't be disappointed, but what actually makes the book worth reading is that ultimately, through their own words, these guys are revealed as human in the sense that the average non-rock star can identify with the outlandish members of Motley Crue on some level. Not normal. Not average. But still human."
5,the dirt,"This is an incredible book. It is as exciting to read as it was listening to my first Motley record ever. The boys in the crue take you on a journey that every teenage boy dreamed of, and also through the nightmares of drug addiction and alcholism.... Great read for any ""metal"" freak."
4,Rock n Roll Raunch,Very detailed accounts of sex drugs and Rock N Roll. Appaulling! These are some nasty guys! Defanitely a page turner though. I will always remember this vivid book.
4,....AND THEY MADE IT OUT ALIVE,"This book is a riot. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the language and descriptiveness. If you are not easily offended by decadence and debauchery, this book is for you. It will also give you a better understanding about the band members and some of what they hae went thru. I used to think Mick was just a freak that never spoke or moved--I found out why. This book is truly in their own words, if you want to hear it staright from the horses mouth this is the book for you."
2,Boring.,"If you have followed Motley Crue throughout their career, even part way, then you know what's in this book. There are some tidbits of stuff in there that have not been made to the general public before, and are the only interesting items to read. But over all, this book is beyond boring. Tommy and Nikki slept with every Playboy Playmate in existence. So? Then they married them all, divorced them all, and whined about them all. Sorry, but you get no sympathy if you go through Playmates the way normal people go through paper towels. They had the good life and screwed it up. Royally.Synopsis of the book - woke up, did bags of dope, slept with numerous women, passed out. Turn page and repeat.The true shining light of this book what the chapter on Vince and Skylar. That was truly heartbreaking. No one should have to go through that much pain.Save your money - go see them in concert."
4,Wild stories,"Pure entertainment Crue Style. I read Tommyland, Tommy Lee's book, and was interested in reading this one. Not a bad read and never gets boring."
4,"Great book, but just a little over-embelished.","This book is a FUN read and I have no doubt that for the most part things went down exactly as described. However I've also read Neil Strauss' other books and while a brilliant writer, he tend to make things larger than life and more polished than they really were (read the Game especially for examples of this.) Some things in the book seem a little too ""neatly"" described and he glosses over some of the more negative aspects of Motley Crue (And I grew up with them and obsessively followed their press since I was in middle school.)But definitely a thumbs up. Look forward to reading Nikki's new book for comparison."
5,High Praise From a Non-Reader,"I have always struggled to read. It takes me months to read a book half the length of this one. THIS book I finished in less than five days! It's that much fun!The first time I heard 'Shout at The Devil' at a friend's house, 17 years ago, I was hooked for life. I have to stress that you don't need to be a fan of the band to enjoy this book. It's just a really entertaining ride. The chapters by Mick are hysterical! The way that each tale is told from four (and sometimes more) points of view is clever and keeps you turning pages, wondering what the other sides to the stories are.(...)This book is a great gift for anyone who has ever dreamt of the Rock-n-Roll lifestyle. I only wish ALL books were this entertaining. I'd cut off my cable and stop seeing movies!"
4,For Crue Fans Only,"This is a pretty cool book, but if you are not a fan, I don't think you will really care about this stuff. The only problem I had with the book was the truth. There is some stuff that seems it was added for entertainment value. None the less, it was an easy and entertaining read."
4,This book made me angry,"I'm about halfway through as I write this...previous reviews are correct in that you simply can't put this book down, mainly because every time you think the band has sunk to the deepest depths of depravity, they surprise you by going further. This is a story of how four people who lived like utter pigs and treated themselves and those around them with utter disdain made millions of dollars with very little talent.The book makes me angry because I hate to see people with no values and minimal talent retire before age 30 with more money than they'll hope to spend in a lifetime. Still, the book is a bona fide page-turner, and I'll likely read it again and again with the fascination of watching a car crash."
5,Livewires,"I'd have to admit that regardless of whether you're a fan of their music or not, this book makes for an excellent read. It's almost like a memorandum of the blooming 1980's Los Angeles subculture that harkens back to something out of a Bret Easton Ellis novel only ""The Dirt"" actually works without the aimless drivel. Nikki Sixx & his cohorts infatuation with the hedonistic routine are ferociously direct in their escalation from a hungry local band to recognition as MTV darlings. Commencing grande tales of debauchery & fornication from arena concert after hour antics to glitzy mansion shindig's to the countless substance abuse outing's. It's all the incentives, high's, low's, depravity, & demons that come with fame & fortune brought to you by none other than one of hair metal's surviving leading bands. A truly great book."
5,I'm converted!,"I wasn't a huge fan of Motley Crue (with the exception of looking at Nikki Sixx), but reading this book has turned me into a total hardcore Crue fan. Not only is it extremely well laid out and written...it shows each person's personality and lets it all hang out....good and bad. Trust me, you'll love this book! I couldn't put it down."
5,I love Jack Daniels,"Now I remember, I was there in the 1980's. I remember I had a Crue t-shirt that I totally ragged out. I remember watching M TV and Girls, Girls Girls would come on. I really enjoyed reading this book and reliving much of what was fun about the 80's. There was booze, there was drugs, and there was sex. Some of the stories seem a bit far fetched, but that is why they are so good. Just sit back, pour a glass of the good stuff (we don't drink out of the botle any more do we?), and enjoy this read."
4,Good and Nasty yet Eye-Opening,"Its got all the sex, drugs and rock-n-roll you want. It's a quick, fun read...The ""eye-opening"" is more like a re-remebering that this genre of heavy metal was full of post-punk kids who bonded with music full of angst and rage. It is hard to forget formulaic ""hair band"" ... music and its multitude of players, but at its onset it was really touching a raw nerve and actually saying something about the times of these explosive kids. Then the ""we'll spray our hair and sound like Quiet Crue or Danger Ratt"" pawns fell prey to the ""corporate geniuses"" and washed it all away with teenage dance-marketability and sterile music. The Crue certainly became a victim of this themselves later on, but who could blame them for any decisions they made seeing as how they were very rarely sane. It would have been a wild ride to hang with them at the beginning of this mess, though. Tommy Lee does need to cut down on the ""Duuuude""s..."
5,Down and Dirty,Good read if you want to know all the gross and shocking details of Motley Crue among them a cockroach infested apartment-very entertaining and fun to read.
5,If nothing changes.......nothing changes,"...Lets face it,back in the 80's no one could touch these guys as far as debauchery and gut wrenching rock n roll but its 2002.I read the book on the flight out and sat in my seat giggling at their insane antics.Although the book is written in almost a diary way its all in past tense so the guys reflect on what they did in hindsight which made it a more interesting read.You wanna feel sorry for them but its kinda hard when you own 10 mansions,20 Ferrari's,private jets,have the best drugs,are banging the hottest women on earth,and have millions of fans around the world.This is what rock n roll is suppossed to be about the way i understood it...Buy this book.you will laugh,you will cry and you will see a side of the music business most people never realize exists..."
5,"Sex, Drugs & Rock n' Roll","This book was such an honest and eye opening look into the lives of one of the biggest metal rock bands. It was a real page turner and I didn't want to put it down. Neil Strauss has done an amazing job of putting it all together and the boys did an excellent job of telling the tale of their crazy lives, which to them seemed normal. It's all you ever wanted to know (and some stuff you can't even imagine) about the life of bad boy rockers and their triumphs and downfalls. I would totally recommend this book to anyone, whether a Crue fan or not, because I enjoyed it soooooo much! I really hope that these boys put out another one about their lives after the book was published, and that Neil Strauss will hopefully write for more bands! Excellent buy! It'll blow you away!"
5,Beyond belief,Read this book. But only if you have a strong stomach.The behaviour chronicled in this book is almost (but not quite) beyond belief: it has the ring of a truth beyond the comprehension of most.An awesomely entertaining read and a chronicle of debauchery at a supernatural level.
5,Dirtier than Dirt,"The Dirt gives the Motley Crue fanatic a real chance to glimpse into the minds of four of the craziest, excessive, creative, passionate, loving, dedicated, and impulsive rock stars on the planet. These bad boys pull you into their world and let the fan experience the parties, girls, drugs, car crashes, deaths, divorces, rehab visits, and the numerous times of cheating death. After reading this book you feel a genuine respect for these very real rock gods and wonder how in the hell they are all still alive (especially Nikki)!!!!! This book is an absolute must for anyone who is intrigued by the sex, drugs, and Rock N Roll lifestyle."
5,I've read it twice already,This is the one book that I could not put down. Some of the stories can be a bit outrageous but it made for fun reading. I had the same dream Motley did. They had made it to the big times and their book gave me a taste of what it would be like.
1,yawn,"They already told it all in their Behind the Music. Getting drunk, wrecking a car, killing a friend and maiming two people is not cool. Sorry Vince, but that's not ""rock and roll."" And then we learn that Nikki Sixx lapped up Ozzy's urine after Ozzy passed out and peed his pants. Pathetic.One star is generous."
1,site said they had the book but yet it was never sent to me or no refund,I never received a refund or my book. I will never buy from them again
1,the crue rules,is official the boys have done it all just when you think is all over they out do themselves this book is great even for someone like me that does not like to read but when I heard about this I had to have one and once I started reading I was hook I could not stop This is a must have for every cruehead out there now if tommy will get back....that will be something but then again they will save it for the dirt 2 buy the book it rocks
5,Lives up to the title,"Awesome book, hands down one of the best autobiographies of a rock band ever. Reads really easy and is a lot better from the entire group, rather than one persons memories of how things went down. Motley Crue really knew how to party!! Would have loved to have been a part of it (if I could have survived)"
5,THE BEST EXAMPLE OF R'NR EXCESS AVAILABLE,"Nothing can prepare you for what is in this book. Do yourself a favor and just read it. You don't even have to like Motley Crue, although you will after you finish. Hands down the most entertaining, hardest-to-put-down book I have ever read."
4,"Great read, very surprised.",I was very surprised that this book was so good. I expected it to be poorly written or self serving but it wasn't. I am not a Motley Crue fan but I love biographies and this one did not disappoint. The guys are very honest even if it doesn't make them look good. Great read.
3,Is this stuff true?,"Big book but an easy and quick read.This book does lack lots of details of their escapades. They really just state the escapade and move on. I am not sure if this stuff really happened or were they just too smashed to remember what happened.I did not feel like I was there like other readers express but I still admire the Crue's reflections on their upbringing and how they feel about themselves. Any reader can tell that due to their childhood that they lack alot of maturity or ability to handle all their fame and people they meet.Nonetheless, this book is great and I enjoy picking up the book and reading about their adventures with the drugs and the girls."
4,What You'd Expect,"This well-written book about Motley Crue is pretty much what you'd expect. Debauchery, drugs, sex, booze, insanity, and rehab. As a fan of 80's metal, you'll love it. As a fan of Motley, you'll go crazy over it."
5,Excellent Book,"Was made fun of at work for it and it was worth it. I absolutely could not put this book down. I laughed, cried and wondered if Nikki was ever gonna let the other guys have some input."
3,As always with the Crue...good entertainment,"This was a very entertaining read. I only give it 3 stars though because I'm a huge motley collector since 1983 and most of this book is old news. Plus it doesn't ask enough tough questions--and get the answers. Last time I saw them (Phoenix, AZ) they started a riot, fans got hurt, and Nikki and Tommy were arrested. Nikki laughs and says that's what rock n roll is about. No Nikki, that's not a cool thing to do. And the author should have called you on some of the nonsense you've said. Not doing enough to hold the band accountable is a biggie in my opinion. Other than this flaw though, the book is well written. I like that each member gets to say their piece. Check it out!"
5,Awesome,This biography is awesome. I really liked Motley Crue's music but had no idea how much they went through as (troubled) people growing up. I would recommend it to fans of the band as well as people who don't even listen to rock music
5,Awesome!,As a Motley Crüe fan I could not wait until read this! I don't know why but there's no translate to the Crue's Book here in Brazil...but finally I got my copy here in amazon. Awesome book!
4,BEYOND DECADENCE!!!,"Having been a rock groupie and no stranger to the Sunset Strip scene, I was STILL blown away by the antics of this band! Motley Crue redefined ""excess"", and I'm amazed that they were able to make music amidst the chaos and partying that was their existance. Some of the things the band did were horrifying.... and I don't shock easily. I recently met Nikki Sixx at a signing, and he looked hot. Vince looked a bit more worn out, but the girls still flocked to them. For any Crue fan, this book is a must read."
4,What wild history,"The men I thought of as gods when I was a teenagers were such PIGS, and I never knew it. But they have all grown into amazing men, fathers, husbands and best of all musicans. Through this book you realize the evolution of not only the Crue as men, but the evolution of thier music and the music of the 80's and now.I thought the book was a great history of the bad boys of rock and roll. I really liked that they each had various chances to tell their version of the same story, thier way. At times I did feel as though I was ready porn, it is true Motley Crue. I do wish that Mick Mars had more to say, I finished the book and really wanted to know more about the quiet gutiar player who could really kick some...I recommend this boook to those that are true fans and those who just might be a fan, you will be at the end."
3,If you like to be disgusted...,"If you want to be totally grossed out, this is the book for you!!!I knew it was going to be gross, but, I had NO IDEA it was going to be as bad as it was!Not a bad read, but will turn your stomach!!!!!!"
3,Needs to be put on AUDIO,"Since most Crue fans probably aren't avid readers, I bet they would sell millions of copies of this book if it were put on audio. Ask Gene Simmons."
4,"Motley Crue ""The Dirt""","I don`t read a whole lot of books. but I read this one in 4 days. The ups and the downs are all there, but the sideways angle seems to be the best sometimes.If you think you`ve heard the craziest Ozzy Osbourne story you could hear, then definitely get this book. You won`t be disappointed. Not to mention the other guys............."
4,Motley Crue Debauchery,I have a hard time putting this book down. I grew up during the 80's attending all of these concerts and to hear what was really going on behind the scenes is fascinating!
5,Motley Crue The Dirt,A very awesome book.I can't wait for a second book to be published.I enjoyed the book very much.For all the true Motley Crue fans I would advise you all to purchase this book for sure.I loved it!!
5,One of the best reads yet.,"I'm in no way a fan of Motley Crue, since I was born during their time of fame, but this book is still one of the best reads I've ever had. It's filled with crazy off-the-wall adventures and events that us ordinary non-rock stars will probably never come close to experiencing (ie. nailing a punk's ear to a table, killing someone in a drunken car crash, lining up girls on against the wall to have sex with them...), and it's thoroughly enjoyable to read about twenty years after the fact. The fun of this book isn't non-stop, though -- it seems that after about 120 pages into it, the reckless hedonism of the boys turns into a mature feeling guilty about living so recklessly and the whole rest of the book is about them trying to get into a clean and normal life, with two decades of trying to repair the band as well.You know you want to feel like a rock star for a few hundred pages. Here's your chance."
5,Awesome couldn't put it down,"I'm not a reader by any means. I prefer TV. I couldn't put this book down. The descriptions were so real. These people led a life of excess, debauchery and more excesses."
5,Rock N Roll Decadence at its best!!!,"THE DIRT gives us the behind the scenes look at the band that we thought we knew almost everything about. MOTLEY CRUE has been one of the top rock bands of the last 20 years and now we know the rest of the story. We get a look at their childhoods upto the present. I can say that there is never a dull moment when reading this book. The tales they tell make all the other rock stories seem tame. We see how drugs nearly destroyed the band, how dysfunctional their relationships with each other are. We get to see who slept with who's girlfriend, usually it was Vince the sex maniac. All the dirt of the last 20 years of the band is on display here and if you are a fan of the band, you will read this and really get the whole story. If you are just an avid reader, then I think that you will also enjoy this book. This book gets 2 thumbs up"
5,OK,"excellent book, arrived before the estimated time, good shipment, i recomend it, i will go back to buy with this seller.thanks"
5,To infinity and beyond!,"This book is entertaining as hell. If you're a fan of the genre or a fan of the band, you'll enjoy reading this book. Debauchery at its finest."
4,worth the price of admission,"""The Dirt"" gives an insightful and entertaining look into the lives and careers of Motley Crue. It amazes in the fact that any of band members survived their exploits to have written this book. If you're a fan of 80s rock and roll and have wondered about just how gluttonous celebrity is Nikki, Tommy, Mick and Vince lay it out there for you to bask in their marvels."
5,Not for the faint hearted!!! But this book @!*$@# ROCKS!!,"I keep putting this book down... This book has taken so long to get through...BECAUSE I DON'T EVER WANT IT TO END!!!! I have never read a book where i would finish a chapter and go back to re-read it immediately! It's amazing that Motley Crue has this kind of detailed recall considering the lifestyle, but I BLESS them for it!! This is a truly gritty read but if your like me, THAT'S THE BEST KIND. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, BUY IT NOW."
3,Good for your ADD child,"This book is obsessed with talking about ADD and ADHD, to such a degree that it seems these are the only children who can be ""Indigo Children.""It really should be called ""The Care and Feeding of your ADD or ADHD child."
5,Insightful,"I loved this book. If you believe in this kind of stuff, it's very helpful in understanding how to care for your special child! I would recommend this book to anyone open minded!"
4,It's good and informative,"This book is ok. I'm a christian person and who also likes New Age stuff.The author did the best she could in this subject. I enjoyed fully it was not a waste of my money. Whatever your believes are in does not matter b/c the truth is that there are special souls born into this Earth with a special purpose and they have been given more talents and more strenght to accomplish this mission. It's a true fact that stronger souls are being born now. Look at the world around you, it makes sense.I say if you are curious get it and you'll be ok."
4,Wonderfull tree,This is a really good looking tree. The only thing was some of the lights didnt work so we had to search through all the lights to find the bad one which took about an hour. I didnt realize how big the tree was gonna be till I took it out the box. But I am in love with it now. It was worth every cent we spent on it. I cant wait till next year when my grandson is 2. He loved our little tree this year so I cant wait to see his face with we put this one up. I highly recommend this tree. Just make sure you have enough room for it.
4,Im a real dog: A 11 year old's review,"I got Scamps for Christmas and I love him already. Here are Scamps good points and bad points.Some good points are:He teaches that you have to be patcient when training an animal.He cant brake that easily.Is very fun to watch when performing ""tricks""Cant walk (I swear he would run away)Some bad points are:Doesnt always listenHis neck can snap if not careful (ouch)So ya he has more on the colums but my fingers are getting tired. His price is a little high but Scamps is totally worth it. Even with some of the bad stuff (nobodys perfect). :)"
2,Scamps is not worth the price paid!,"My daughter received Scamps from her Aunt for Christmas. The dog does not interact as well as we thought it would. When you give it a command, it responds incorrectly. We do not like the idea that the dog has to be played with in a quiet room for it to work. We agree with the other reviews that the dog should walk for how much it costs. This is a disappointing toy and we are glad we saved all the packaging and receipts so we can return it for a refund."
3,It's Okay,"This toy is alright, but does not really do much; only buy it if your child is specifically asking for it and that is all they want for the holiday."
4,Cute toy!,"I bought Scamp the Golden Retriever for my daughter last year. Scamp is adorable. She had him doing tricks and responding to her voice commands within a few days, but he only sits on her bookshelf now. I think she just outgrew him. Younger children (3 or 4 years) would probably enjoy Scamps more than the older ones, but they will need him programming him."
2,"Fun, at first","I got this toy from my grandma, and I named her pearl. When I got home, I ran to get batteries so I could play with it. It was amazing, at first at least. It wasn't that it didn't stop working. It worked just fine, and amused my grandma, my sister, and me. Soon it had us laughing with joy. When my mom came home it amused her to. It never did stop working. I played with it for the first three weeks or so. But by then I'd stoped playing with it. I was 11, so mabey it was age. The next time I played it was at a family party, I showed a group of people some of the tricks it could do. It amused them to. I never played with it since. When I put some of my animals up in our attic, I took the batteries out, and havn't put them back in. It's on my self now, but onley because it is a cut dog, it is a quelity toy. I still havn't played with it. Now I want a nintendog plush. To find out more about that you hav to read my review on it. Just type in nintendogs plush on the search bar."
4,"Just as Advertised, Though It Would Be Nice to Get TWO in One Package","Not much to say other than what my review title says. i knocked off one star from a perfect 5 because, really, it should be two adapters for this cost and pairs make more sense for those of us who use a lot of adapters. i would buy again, though.i use this to connect my MacBook Pro's optical audio output to my home theatre amp's optical digital input with a standard SP/DIF TOSlink cable."
1,More fuel for hate,More fuel for hate...that's what Yakos' book's all about: hate and ignorance. Little wonder then that because of this blind Jeudo-christian hate for Islam and Muslims radicals such as Bin Laden are born.Paul
3,"Unit works well, but one fader sticks","The unit works, but my channel one 250hz fader sticks towards the top. The whole reason I got the dbx was for quality. I don't feel like I got that 100%.For this reason I would suggest just getting a cheaper Nady or Behringer. What's the point in paying the high price if it's made in china too and is lacking on build quality?Sound wise, it's transparent just like the other ones will be."
2,I just did not like it at all.,I'm not sure if I got a bad product but this EQ will not make much difference unless its all the way up on every single way. if you looking for a lot better unit than this one for a lot less money try the BEHRINGER ULTRAGRAPH PRO FBQ1502 this is a great beautifull unit and the sound its awesome.
5,A mystery devotional--what a great idea!,"I have two favorites when it comes to reading-God's Word and mysteries. What a treat to find that Linda Evans Shepherd has expertly woven them together! Although you'll be captivated and entertained by the story, the intended message is clear: sin has consequences. But the story doesn't end there. Tangled Heart shares the hope and freedom God offers each of us, regardless of our pasts."
2,Didn't realize it was a miniature book,"My own fault, but I didn't realize it was a miniature book that I ordered. I ended up having to purchase the full sized book in addition to the miniature one because I needed the full version for a study group."
1,VERY DECEIVING!,I am very angry over this purchase. I have purchased used books many times on Amazon and have always gotten a good deal. This was NOT at all what we wanted. Our study group starts this book in 3 days and I purchased it thinking it was the big book/ the original full-sized text. Now I've spent $3.00 plus $3.00 shipping on top of that for a book as big as my hand!! We'll have to go out today and purchase the full-sized book at a regular book store so that we'll be ready for our group. We are on a very tight budget and this was a very disappointing purchase. I just hope no one else makes this mistake.
3,Product stoped working after 2 minutes,The Oven stopped working after 2 minutes. I contacted the manufacture and hard a had time getting a replacement. The seller was very helpful in contacting the manufacture and I believe this is the only reason I will be getting a new oven.
5,We love this thing,We love this thing... We have used this thing every day since we have got it... It is great...
1,Buyer Beware!,This oven is not what they make it out to be. It is basically a heating element with a very weak fan inside a dome. You put food onto a rack and it gets browned very nicely FROM ABOVE. Note that everything you cook must be flipped over half way through cooking so the other side can get cooked! Anything frozen will get soggy on the bottom and will be a mess to flip over. You cannot cook with more than one tray level. Anything on the lower level simply won't get cooked.
1,Jack Conway,"I bought one of these Nuwave 20322 Pro Digital-Controlled Infrared Tabletop Oven, Black; with in one year the large plastic ring fell apart. I wrote to Amazon,no help. Wrote to Nuwave,no help I couldn't even buy a new large plastic ring. I liked it till it fell apart. I trashed it."
4,Very satisfied with purchase.,"I wouldn't say it performs exactly as the informercial but it is darn close. So far I have cooked a salmon, french fries, pizza rolls for the kids, and two expensive New York strips. The salmon, fries, and pizza turned out really nice. The steaks were good but not great as I was hoping. It could be that I am just used to grilling my red meats on an outdoor grill and was measuring the results to that standard. I say that this oven will be perfect for all poultry, fish, porks, beef roasts, and other frozen items that you would normally but in an oven. Steaks and burgers aren't meant for the oven, any oven. In summation, it cooks fast, seals in the flavor and is really easy to clean up. I love it's simplicity and how it doesn't heat up the kitchen. The only cons are it was bigger than I expected and the cooking times are longer than they list in the recipe book. I would buy it again."
4,Awesome addition to the kitchen,"I've had this device now for about 3 months. Was a little skeptical when I first got it because it seemed a bit overhyped on the infomercials. The food looked too perfect.I've used it for cooking a range of items, including frozen steak, fish, chicken patties, and frozen fries. For the ost part, the food comes out like it would from a conventional oven, but in less time. Fairly easy to clean as well. Only problem I've had is that the lid does get hot and you need to be very careful removing items after cooking."
3,"It works, but not as expected.","I was under the impression that this machine would speed up cooking time on everything that we cooked. Don't try cooking a whole chicken, and don't expect to save time with this thing. The chicken that we tried had to be taken out and put in the oven to get it done. We did cook a london broil on it, and once again, the cooking time was atleast as long as other methods ( it did taste good though ). It cooks bacon well, but don't plan on having more than 7 or 8 peices. It tells you in the manual that you shouldn't cook things in the Nu-wave that would be better prepared in another process, like a roast, or a pan dish like lasagna.... limiting the broad range of advertised capabilities. Overall, I think that if I had this information before I bought, I would decide to go with another peice of equipment. As I said before, the food that you can cook in here does taste good, but it would taste good in the oven just the same."
2,Nuwage 20322 Head heating system broke less than 6 months,"Customer service is efficient in replacing the defective head heating system which is what cooks the food. I'm not happy that this oven broke with minimal usuage. As a result my wife ended up with uncooked chicken. Since then, she does not want to use it again so I have it in my closet collecting dust."
3,Not really impressed...,"When I bought this product I was led to believe it cooks from the inside out as well as the outside in. It doesn't. It's a smaller version of a convection oven. It's okay but I also have a convection oven so for me, I don't really feel that excited about it. It doesn't always brown the food, it's not always tender and moist. Clean up is aggravating because you have to wipe down the dome thoroughly as well as all of the levels you've used. I'm actually happier with my miniature crock pot that I bought for just a few bucks! The bucket comes out. I clean that and the top. Simple. I sooo wanted to be impressed. I'm just not."
3,NuWave Oven Pro - disappointing,"I purchased my NuWave Oven Pro in Nov, 2010 - and in the 2.5 mo. I owned it used it about 4 times. I loved the way it cooked a frozen roast to finished perfection in an hr. Loved the way it makes pizza. BUT when I took it out of my cupboard to use it the 5th time it beeped at me when I plugged it in and then nothing. I could not get it to work... I am thankful the place I purchased it at is agreeing to take it back but it is still a hassle for something I only used a handful of times. I wonder if anyone else has had this experience. For this reason I rate it as merely ""OK"" and am not inclinded to replace it."
1,Reject,"This item was delivered with two chips in the base/dome. Packing of the Nuwave oven box and the exterior Amazon box were both unprofessional so I am not sure if this problem is a manufacturing defect or damage from shipping but I bet it was a defect that was deliveed to someone else, rejected and then delivered to me. I think if was a repackaged reject because the Nuwave oven box packing material appeared to have been opened and then put back/stuffed by someone who was not on the factory production line. So I have wasted enough time with Amazon/Nuwave on this, requested a refund and have sworn off acquiring this product."
5,Short and Sweet!,You ever watch the commercial for this product? Everything stated on it is true. Frozen foods cooked in an hour and a half...TRUE.... Many foods you cook in the microwave taste Much Much better in the Nuwave 20322. Just leave it out on the counter as you will be using it nearly everyday!
3,the book's instruction,"the books instructions on cooking are totally bogus. cut up chicken is tobe cooked at 170 degrees fahrenheit for 10 minutes on each side. not going to happen. but it does cook at 350 degrees F. maybe 10 mins on ea. side, not sure because i was testing with increasing heat. does cook it tho. good job."
2,False Advertising,We bought the Nuwave cooktop and we were going to get the 2nd one free just pay S&H. 2 months later We got the second after hours on hold over several days we finaly called the number to order a new one THEN you get a live person. Well after several calls to that # we finaly got are 2nd Nuwave. But we never got the promised walmart gift card. The cook top works well but to new to comment on its duribility. If someting goes wrong DON'T expect any real form of customer service.
1,Don't buy this product,"I had gotten my Nuwave awhile ago, at first I was really happy with it. But 3 Domes later and 1 terrible experience with customer service I hate this product!!! It works great, however the Domes have a limited shelf life. I have had three domes and all of them broke with in 3 months. You just have to keep buying them. They make an indesructable one with a warranty however if it breaks with in the three years, you still have to pay the price of the other one to get a new one. So basically the warranty is worthless, they don't send you a new one if it breaks, they make you pay the price for the regular one anyways. What is the point of paying for this machine if you are going to have to keep spending $40 every few months to keep it working?"
1,Broken after a year!!!,"Horrible!!!!! Broken down after 1 year of light use. I did not abuse my nuwave and kept is clean. But after one year the unit just stopped working and I have contact cust service and they said sorry your 1 year warranty just expired and there is nothing we can do about that. I really like the nuwave but for dam sure will not be purchasing another one since there is a chance this BS can happen again. I was hoping the company would understand that a ""oven"" should last much longer then 1 year. I have had my kitchen oven for over 6 years with no problem but do not want to use if for every task. I am hoping amazon can step in and help out. But I will not hold my breath. If you do purchase one of these make sure you get an extending warranty to cover yourself."
4,Use the oven daily,"We are on our second oven. The first one is still going as we gave it to a friend of ours who is a senior. He lives is a studio apartment and has little room. He loves the oven,but has dropped the lid a couple of times and it has cracked, but still usable.We use the oven every day for many purposes. It does amazing prime rib roast.Cons are it is a bit large and the lid holder is tricky. The dome will crack in time. It has done so on both ovens.Works great as a dehydrator ,too.In all I love this oven and would recommend it to anyone. Great for students and seniors."
5,Excellent Purchase For Busy People,"This product has really been an asset! I tend to work long hours and due to the quick cooking time and the fact that food can be cooked right out of the freezer, many of my dinner time dilemmas disappear. My husband has even started using it (now that's saying something) because it's so easy to use! It does an amazing job on chicken - even skinless chicken. We've had great success with fresh and frozen meats of all kinds (even bacon) plus eggplant parm and roasted potatoes - all excellent. Aside from the size of the unit this product has been a blessing and we use it regularly. It cleans up quite easily and helps my family prepare healthier meals because there's no need for oils to cook. Great product."
2,Nuwave 20322 Pro Digital Infrared Tabletop Oven,"When I saw the infomercial, I thought this unit would be great since it looked smaller than a convection oven. Pop it in and pop it back out...your food is done in a flash. What they don't tell you that you have to turn over your food and cook the other side. My convection oven does the same thing in less time without having to turn your food over. It comes with a cooking time chart. Got to play around with the cooking times...they are not always right. If you have a small sink, cleaning the canister can be a challenge since it's pretty big."
4,Great little oven! Not so good recipes.,"I love this oven. The best thing is being able to cook foods from a frozen state. Next best is the three-tier cooking - I can cook meat, veggies and potatoes all at once (I have a round cake cooling rack a half inch high that keeps everything out of any dripping grease and allows air to circulate around the bottom layer). The one downside is working out the cooking times. It takes a bit of practice to get it right, since the times recommended by the company aren't all that accurate, and cutting the veggies and potatoes into the right sizes and deciding which rack to put them on so it all comes out at the same time can be puzzling at first. I sure wish someone would write a good cookbook for IR ovens..."
5,Great for Non-Handicapped People in Wheelchairs,"My wife is now in a nursing home and I am alone at home. Since I am in a wheelchair, I need for cooking to be done as ergonomically as possible. This machine truly makes foods come out to perfection with little fuss or bother. This would be a must have item for persons living alone or for smaller families. However, when one is in a wheelchair, it is difficult to lift the heavy dome off the base. Included with this oven is a thing that attaches to the side of the base that permits the dome to be tilted to one side. This works somewhat but still is not a perfect idea. When tipping to the side, one must be very careful not to get burned by the hot dome lid. Silicone gloves can be worn for this. Overall, this is a great item for the home."
3,"functions properly, cheaply made","I have been using this for a number of days now. I think that my small convection toaster oven with ""exact heat"" works just as well but is better made.Its parts are all thin plastic or metal. The extra extension ring comes with a sticker that will not come off without destroying the finish on the plastic.I like the concept and the way it works. I just that it is cheap parts all around but for the two racks.Customer service never got back to me on how I was suppose to get off the sticker?If I had it to do over again, I would not buy it."
4,Amazing!,"This nifty little device really does cook like the commercial brags. My only complaint is that it takes longer to cook some things then the instructions say. I cooked a couple of boned chicken breast with some olive oil, italian seasoning, and garlic salt brushed on and they were amazing! I recommend pre-treating the stainless steel rack with a non-stick spray."
3,great product but has inferior cheap parts,"the product has everything going for it except great customer service at Nu wave website and when you call them--even asked to speak to CS supervisor and he's not nice at all...the other problem is their drip pan--i never ever did anything but wash it clean, handling it as if my life depended on it and the coating supposedly comes off without warning...when you call nu wave they say that part is not on warranty--if a product is suppose to be easy to clean then how come that drip pan isn't on warranty--you need that or you'll create a mess--i'm unhappy for those 2 reasons and you should be warned...the drip pan is not included under warranty--buyer be aware--thank you"
2,disappointed!,"I am really disappointed with this oven. I cooked frozen boneless (skinless) chicken breasts. The flavor and texture was not very good (compared to regular oven), especially considering that it didn't save that much time. It is a bulky unit and everything needs to be taken apart and cleaned each time. I don't have to clean inside my regular oven after baking a chicken. My local Fox news channel did a special ""Deal or Dud"" report about the Nuwave ovens on their broadcast the other evening. They determined to product to be a ""dud"". Save your money!"
3,"Nuwave 20322 Pro Digital-Controlled Infrared Tabletop Oven, Black","This product is a GREAT product but when I opened the box, I found the plastic base was broken !!! This is the second one of these I own and I am lucky to have the old base to use. Otherwise, It would be useless. I do not return items at my cost."
1,Pretty but useless!,"I should have learned from my Flavorwave 3 years ago. I didn't like the way that machine cooked at all, but the color of this oven swayed me to try again. I used it a couple of times and didn't like the end results either time. Yams in 20 minutes my eye. I cut the darn yam up and it still took over an hour. The Nuwave now sits upstairs in my attic in the carry all bag collecting dust. I should have learned from the first purchase. I don't recommend this oven at all."
1,second time i used it broke.,"I bought this oven after going through all the positive reviews. However, during my second time usage i heard some broken sound in the oven and ever since i could hear a broken part inside the equipment. I tried calling the nuwave and talked to a rude representative. they could not be of much help. I opened the equipment and found that there is a cooler fan which has broken inside the equipemtn and it is lying loose. Looking at the parts and the quality, I am terribly disappointed.I do not think the positive review in amazon is by real users, it could be a propaganda.I also do not think the quality of cooking done by this oven is uniform or having any special significance. The equipment is basically a heater coil with a fan spreading the heat.I will not purchase any future products from this company."
1,Nuwave review,"I have had this oven for several months and have tried on different items per the cooking instructions. It takes a lot longer to cook than advertised and does not provide the quality you are lead to believe you will obtain. True, I am not a gourmet cook but I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Very poor quality,"One year and 2 weeks and the NEW WAVE burns out, NO WARRANTY, In 6 months the plastic dome began to crack, and turns cloudy, It would not be too bad if the unit sold for $50.00 USD, But $139.00 USD can't afford one every year at this rate. On the positive note, It cooks very well and fast, saves electricity, Food is great, tender and tasty. The company needs to check on the quality control on these units. Very poor workmanship and product. What do you want when its MADE IN CHINA. Stay away from this unit unless you can afford a new unit yearly and a new dome every 6 months.. BEWARE......"
4,Great American/Celtic music,"As I know it, Rathkeltair is a North Florida Band. We have seen them perform at the Northeast Florida Scottish Festival. They are great. Very high-spirited and energetic energy from this band. This album is terrific."
5,Books,This book is a great addition to the first volume. Together they provide an enlightening journey into another critical evidence of the authenticity of Genesis 1-11. Good work.
1,A little Far-Fetched and extreme...,"Being Chinese in ethnicity, I was intrigued as to how the Chinese language and the Bible correlated. Many of the characters seemed like they were being stretched though to bring about the relationship so wasn't very happy with the purchase. However, I couldn't even get through a third of the book before I had to put it down. It got to where everything was really far-fetched and didn't make any sense whatsoever based on the Chinese I know. It's good for a starting point but would not recommend this to anybody who truly wants to get a good feel of what correlations there are between Chinese characters and the Bible. Or for anybody who wants a good laugh."
3,Snack Food for the True Crime Fan . . .,"Well, if you're looking for a little ""popcorn book"" of true crime, look no further! This one is pure snack food, comprised of 28 short chapters--with an average length of just 10 or 11 pages each--but for what it is, I would say it is well done. It has plenty of black-and-white photos that acquaint you with the principal players or the crime scene or both, and it spans the unusual range of 1872 to 1980. This permits an interesting historical backdrop to the universal motives of status, money, power, sex, and love. In every case, either the murderer or the victim was famous. Some of the more recent cases that you are likely to remember are those of Claudine Longet, Dan White, Jean Harris, and Claus von Bulow (alleged slayers) and Ramon Novarro, Sal Mineo, Dorothy Stratten, and John Lennon (victims). I got the book used, and I didn't plan to read the whole thing . . . but I'm glad I did."
3,it is ok,I did not like the way it fit me even thoufh I liked the skirt. I think I am too lumpy the wear skirt comfortably so I returned it.
2,Ruffle skirt,"You cannot tell from the pic or description, but there is definitely a ruffle on this skirt. I think I would have really liked it minus the ruffle, but that was just not flattering for me and I had to return it."
4,Comfortable and nicely made,"This is a nice, casual skirt for the weekend, etc. It isn't lined or anything like that, but it seems to be made of durable fabric and is well made."
4,Great skirt- way too big!,"I LOVED the skirt- but it was huge! I'm a size 4, tried the 4, then I ordered the 2, which was STILL too big...If they had a smaller size I would buy it. Sadly I had to send them both back."
3,product out of stock,"giving it 3 stars since other reviewers are every happy with the product. However, it was out of stockand could not receive it. The seller was prompt in cancelling the order."
4,Great skirt,"I purchased this skirt to wear on casual Fridays. I was intrigued by the pockets and the a-line look of it. When I tried it on for the first time I was thrilled. I especially like the pockets, i love wearing skirts but often times miss having a spot to put things!I ended up ordering a 12, I typically wear anything from a 10-14 and am very curvy. It is slightly loose in the waist and does hug my butt a little, but overall I am happy with how it looks, but for those of you out there who are very curvy like me, it will not fit both your hips/butt and your waist....but I think most of us are use to that by now. I intend to take the waist in about and inch and then the fit will be just perfect."
4,LOVE this skirt,"I wear this skirt a lot and think it is very comfortable. I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because it runs pretty big. The skirt size I fit in to is at least 2 sizes smaller, by the tag, than the size of my Eddie Bauer jeans (so, size 8 skirt, size 12 jeans). But, it fits me about the same around the waste as the jeans. The skirt also has some decent stretch to it, so take that in to account as you choose your size."
2,Not for me,"I bought this skirt for travel. It's lightweight, easy to wash by hand and dries quickly. However, the pockets protrude from the skirt, thus doesn't look good on and the material feels stiff and isn't very comfortable."
1,Not a cookie...,"I don't know how to better describe it - these were just absolutely disgusting. I kept them in the freezer like the directions said to keep them from spoiling, but they tasted spoiled from day one. The texture is akin to oatmeal mixed with molasses. The 'cookies' are very dry and very salty, and are not the consistency of a cookie. There is no sweet taste to them at all, nor any noticeable amount of chocolate. I had one and had a friend try another, and ended up throwing the remaining 22 away after they stayed in my freezer for several months. This has been my worse purchase on Amazon in years."
4,Yummy cookie,Very good cookie. We eat one most nights as dessert.Less cal than other choices and healthy also.And filling.
5,Excellent textbook,"I am currently using this text in a translation class. Larsen builds on the work of her predicessors, but does a much better job of breaking down the information on this vast subject into bite-sized pieces than anyone else. Note, this is not an easy read, but a textbook. It is not a night stand book or summer beach novel. It is very comprehensive and takes some effort in reading and utilizing the excercises in order to gain the most benefit. However, if you have an interest in how to translate meaning from one language into another, this text is indespensable."
2,They did not have it although they advertised it,I was told that they did not have it and I had to go to another source to get it. I had to pay a lot more and this is unfortunate. I depend on Amazon to help me keep the costs down.
3,fun but needs improvements,The game is fun but it could be larger. The squares are quite small. It would also be nice if navigating it was easier by using the keys more and the mouse less.
4,"Can't understand a word, but I love it","Somehow, someway this CD ended up in my collection. Honestly, I have no idea how this CD came to me. Just before I made it a coaster or a mini-frisbee I decided to put it in the player... Wow, MANA blew me away! This esquisitly made album is truly wonderful. The title cut Cuando Los Angeles Lloran is a marvelous song. In fact, nearly every one of these songs gets me humming along. Since don't know a word of Spanish I let the melody and the fine performances carry me along. MANA has a fan in the Great White North (Minnesota). Please don't let a language barrier disuade you from giving this great band a listen."
5,Un grupo que pone sentimiento en la música.,"Creo que Cuando los Angeles Lloran es el mejor disco de Maná hasta el momento, las letras dejan mensajes valorables. A mi parecer se destaca la sensibilidad y el cuidado conque tocan su música. Instrumentalmente también son excelentes."
1,overrated,"Nothing special about this album, or any of Mana's previous albums. They are extremely overrated! Aleks Syntek, Nek, and Ricky Martin are the best that latin rock has to offer."
5,It's time Mana got some RESPECT!!!!!!!!!!,"Mana is just AWESOME. Alot of english-speaking and even some spanish-speaking people aren't giving Mana the respect they deserve. If they would just listen ta a CD or even just one track, they would automatically start dancing or humming the tune. Even if you don't understand the words you can feel the music. I've been to 2 of Mana's concerts. When I went the vibe in the building is so positive. The music hypnotizes you. The feeling is great!!!!!! So all in all I just think that people should take the time to explore different kinds of music! Just because you don't know spanish doesn't mean you can't listen to MANA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Bird snacks,The corn cobs that I purchased are for my cockatoo. He enjoys them for chewing pleasure which keeps him busy and not bored.
5,integrity,"Thia is a favorite book of mine. I read it to my eight children and to any children's group I had the privilege of teaching. It teaches do not steal and do not try to twist the intentions of authority. Mama Panda gave her son money to pay for ingriedents for a cake, not for him to go to the fair."
5,Simply The Best,"The number one favorite of hundreds of books read to my four small children, (now honors graduates of Boston University, American U., and Syracuse U.) Panda Cake teaches lessons, rhymes, tells a story, entertains and remains memorable 20 years later. Wonderful illustrations and particularly great for younger brothers or sisters. Hands down the cutest relatively modern children's book we have ever read."
5,I LOVE IT,"This book is a childhood favorite of mine and sadly mine was worn to pieces from reading it so much. It was completely unreadable by the time I had my first child so I had to get a new copy. It has a wonderful rhyme and meter to it and it is a wonderful ""moralistic"" story."
2,Flagging Commitment,The citations show that this book was probably most current a decade ago. There does not appear to have been an effort to fully update it since. Pretty expensive under the circumstances.
4,Good but there's a newer edition!,"This is an easy-to-read book that encompasses many theories pertaining to psychology. However, there is a newer edition which may be a better purchase."
1,Problem with edition,"Actually the text was decent - some chapters repeat topics within the same chapter, but that just means you don't have to read the whole chapter! My problem is that I received the international edition and now cannot trade it in. I did not know that ahead of time and am stuck with an expensive book worth nothing."
1,How good can a book be when the publisher won't let you browse it?,"Pearson (the publisher) doesn't avail itself the opportunity provided by Amazon to let readers search the book. It's always helpful when making the decision to shell out more than $150 for a book to see such things as the table of contents and the first few pages of the text (to gauge writing style).I wouldn't buy it myself, and I certainly wouldn't recommend that others buy it. If the publisher is proud of this book, let them make it searchable in Amazon."
5,great product at $100 discount!!,"This is a cadillac quality surge protector. If you have invested more than $2000 in home theatre epuipment, it only makes sense to protect it and to do what you can to extend the life of your components. This item helps do both of those things. It not lonly protects against ""spikes"" and surges in power, it also protects against dips in power that are every bit as damaging to your expensive digital equipment. I had seen this product at local retail places for $254. I nearly choked when I saw it was available at Amazon for $158. Grab it!!"
5,SURGE PROTECTOR,So far this surge protector / filter has worked great and has not given me any problems! It came highly recommended and I have no complaints! Great product to protect a very expensive home theatre system!
5,"Oh, So Great!","This was one of my absolute favorite books when I was a little kid. It's so fun for children to find out the silly things in each picutre. I think it really helps children to be able to see something that's wrong and know how to fix it. Any parent could use this as a learning game, but it's still tons of fun."
2,Golly Betty isn't school swell!,"While the premise of this book is sound, it is too Pollyanna like to be terribly effective. But it makes a good story, sort of ""Joshua Goes to the School Yard"".Anyone who is serious about altering our current course will want to read Robert Fuller's Somebodies and Nobodies, Overcoming the Abuse of Rank. He clearly shows the effects of rankism on all levels, and offers what are such obvious solutions that it is amazing to think they have been ignored for this long. Every person of all walks of life should read this book, do a bit of (honest)soul searching and apply the principles set forth."
5,Beautiful Angus McBride plates,"This is by far the best book on the Vikings from a military perspective, Osprey or otherwise. The text is concise and is both exciting and informative. The plates depict the Viking warriors as well as their enemies and their women with lifelike expressions and poses, and include several spirited battlescenes."
3,Love them and hate them,They were great. reduce sagging by a lot. stiffen the ride a lot too. loved them. then they got older and was rubbing the coating off the springs. then they started squeaking loud. The worst part was they don't stay in place. they bunch up toward the rear of the spring. i feel that might not me good to have all the stiffener on only one side. took them off after dealing with them for a year.
4,Good knuckles,"I used these maybe 4 or 5 years ago. The fronts went in easy, the backs were hard as hell."
2,Woody Guthrie song book,I was disapointed in the number of songs in the collection and the in the songs selected
4,Seen Bees too many time to count,"Great album. I only wish they had recorded it at one of their many tour stops where they were much loved. The audience is not into the performance and the bad does not really fire up as I have seen them so many times. They also fail to include their best song Rasta man in Viet Nam, but if you like Reggae, This is good stuff. I will Miss seeing Michael, (he passed on in 2001). We will miss you! hope your skanking hard in Zion."
2,Doesn't work with iPhone.,"This dock will not charge an iPhone 3G. It will play music and does that well but running on battery power and not charging is a big limitation.With both the 3G and the older iPhone if you receive a text message or a phone call the dock puts out a really loud annoying buzzing noise. By loud I mean really loud and startling noise. So it makes sence to put the phone in airplane mode but then it's easy to forget.Anyway, to sum up. Great for non iPhones, bad for iPhones."
2,flawed,"yes this unit produces probably the best sound of most of the docks out there including the much lauded Bose. the remote also works well. however, it will not charge the ipod nano as stated. it also has fussy connectors that destroyed one of my ipods. now it will not even produce sound. perhaps this was a defective unit, but for the money I would not buy it again."
1,Not for the uncoordinated,"I bought this dvd with the expectation that the instructor would show me how to do each move. I am uncoordinated and prone to the two left feet deal, but if I'm shown how to do a move I'll usually get it on the second or third try. Vicky couldn't be bothered. She just shouted out the move expecting you to know what she was talking about and danced along her merry way. Half the time the video only showed the upper half of the torso so I had to search rewind every five seconds. I suggest this dvd only to those who have taken dance or have perfect muscle memory."
3,VICTORIA JOHNSON CARDIO,I LIKE HER OTHER SELECTIONS BETTER THAN THIS ONE. ITS A LITTLE TOO FAST AND HARD TO FOLLOW THE STEPS
5,Excellent New Zealand Reference,"This is a very well written, well illustrated book on the complete process of New Zealand bone carving. The book covers making your own carving tools, creating designs, choosing material, all stages of carving and finishing, and string lashing techniques. The author smoothly mixes traditional designs and techniques with modern interpretations and tools. This is a complete how-to book if you want to create beautiful bone jewelry, or just a fascinating read if you are interested in Maori culture. If you enjoy this book, also try Moko: The Art and History of Maori Tattooing by H. G. Robley."
1,ROTATING DESCRIPTION --- BUYERS BEWARE,I listed this item using the UPC code....it was a 2008 edition. It ALSO stated that lower in the original posting....NOW the description has REMOVED all DATES. Seems like this issue has been continueing for the past TWO years!!! Above review ordered a 2007 and got 2008....never ending switcheroo!
1,Wrong book sent,"I ordered as the listing stated a 2007 diary book. Instead they sent a 2008 book with no explanation prior to sending it or in the package. I did not need a 2008 i needed a 2007 book, that was the whole reason for my purchase. If they were out of 2007 books then they should have let me know instead of sending me somethin i didnt need just to pocket my money."
4,Loved the color --feel like a princess!,"I purchased this dress for a Naval fromal event here in Spain. When I took the dress out of the box I was thrilled by the deep red color. The fit is good although a bit big in the bust area. I had read in another review that these dresses might run small so I order a ""M"" for my 5""2 122 pd. body. Beside being a very tad (1/4 inch) bit long and a tad bit big in the brust area AND the speed which this dress got to me. I'm 100% happy! I would most certainly purchase from Pacific Plex again."
3,Busty,"After reading the reviews (which I must admit was spot-on)I decided to go a size up and it worked. I also am a size 16 and the 2X was a fit. Thanks so much for the info. Another tip that busty ladies should also take note of is that you will almost definately need to do some adjustment unless you really like to near bare them. I am comfortable with the dress, the material is fine, the style is nice and flattering but I will go for a scarf for some coverage. Which ever way though I will still end up showing more than I bargained for. I gave it three stars because of the ""bare as you dear"" fit at the bust for the bustier girl"
4,Verry pretty,"The dress is beautiful. I received it even earlier than was expected. It is more beautiful in person, than in pics. It is very figure flattering and creates curves for those who don't have them. My only problem is that it is very big in the chest area. It fits me perfectly everywhere elase, except up there. I am not a small girl, so i am not sure exactly who would actually have such big breasts. I hope to get it altered & use it as my wedding dress in November. Othere than that, it's perfect. It's definitely woth the money."
5,Excellent service!,This is such a beautiful dress! I just bought it for my wedding. I can't wait to wear it. I'm really impressed with the seller. I was able to exchange a dress without any problems.
5,loved it!,i absolutely loved this dress. i was looking for a elegant dress for prom not something absolutely ridiculous that was two times your size and i could not really find anything that i like in stores because i am a bit on the bigger side. so i came on here and seen this dress and i loved it so i ordered it. i got the dress within two days i live in sc and it said it came from cali. so when the dress got here i was so scared something wasnt going to fit me right on it but it fit me perfectly i ordered a 3x in the lilac and it looks great on me it actually makes me look smaller. i am very pleased with the size chart it is very acurate and dependable.and for the price of this dress it is amazing what you get. the dress looks like it might have cost up in the 200's not 69.00 so thats just going to be my little secret. if you are like me and cant find another dress anywhere else i would highly recomend this one.
4,Nice Dress for the price.,"I ordered this dress for my vow renewal on the beach. The dress arrived in four days. It came in a box but it was in relatively good condition. I tried it on. I originally ordered a large but after reading the reviews( about dress running small.) I emailed Pacific and changed the size to an extra large.The changed the size and sent me the extra large. The dress is a little big in the bust( I am a 38 D) and the rest of the dress fit ok. I usually wear a 12/14. I will probably have it altered (shorter in the front, longer in the back.)I will have the bust taken in a little as well. Nice dress for the past"
5,BEAUTIFUL Dress! Better in person!,"I bought two of these dresses in Icy Blue. The color is JUST what I was looking for! These dresses are for my bridesmaids. I have been searching everywhere for this color and all I could find were turquoise colors, not what I wanted!! But this dress is perfect! Even better in person and fast shipping!"
1,No WAY this was a 2x!,"it's like they took the XS top and just made a bigger waist. This dress could never have fit even an average chest-size on a 2x woman. And I'm a bit more than ""average"". Was really disappointed. It's a pretty dress, but just so wrong in the cut!"
5,Simple beautiful dress,"Since The last 2 dresses that I bought from them was beautiful and fit in size (by checking the size chart), I helpt my sister to buy this one. She likes it."
4,Great dress,"I was happily surprised with my dress! It is lovely and is a great bargain. The bust does run quite large, so plan to have alterations done on the top. It is a flattering dress on women who are size 12 and up especially. The medallian in the center of the dress is a pin, so it can be removed if you don't like it. I'm using my dress for a bridesmaid dress. I highly recommend this dress!"
5,Love it!,"I was really skeptical about ordering dresses from the internet, especially because they are for my sister's wedding in July, but when we got the dresses we were very happy. There are 7 girls in my sister's wedding and every one of us loves these dresses. They are just as pretty, if not more so, than the picture reveals. Matter of fact my sister loved the dresses so much that she ordered one for herself to change out of her wedding dress at the reception. I would recommend these dresses :-)We are also very pleased with the quality of this dress with the great price, similar dresses at retailer was close to $200.Satin Halter Dress Crystal Pin Prom Formal Prom Bridesmaid"
4,Very Nice!,"This dress is so pretty. Although if you have a big bust like me, it can get a little sore on the neck, but still I love it."
3,Luscious but loose,"This dress is luscious. I ordered 3 for bridesmaid's dresses for my daughter's wedding. Unfortunately, the bodice's are off kilter somehow that would have required the sides to be opened and resewn, not just shortening the halter. Had to send them back."
1,GREAT BUY!!,Fast shipping. I ordered this dress for my daughter's homecoming. Size chart is near perfect. Had to alter a little in the bust area. Was impressed with the quality. We had the slip removed because it was a bother to her legs. It didn't change the look by a lot. You will be pleased with your purchase!!!
2,Get what you pay for?,"The dress is very pretty, it fit, and I was excited about it until I noticed a series of small brown stains down one side, fresh out of the box. I attempted to send it back, but was told that since it was stained, I could not, even though the stain was on the dress when I unpacked it, and not caused by me. I took it to my cleaner, and they said it was unlikely it could be removed. So I'm stuck with a dress that cannot be worn. :("
4,Great dress!!,I am not one who normally buys dresses online but after reading all the reviews for this dress I decided to take a chance since it was such an awesome price. I ordered it late on Sat and got it on Thurs. I just love it. I ordered the Ice color and am thrilled. It is a Cinderella blue or at least that's what my daughter tells me! I am a 36D on top so I ordered the XL and it fits well. The only thing I will have to do is have the length shortened.
2,Pretty decent,"Its not exactaly a shining gem, But if you enjoy sea battles and diversity in your gaming, this is the one for you.You start by buildng a port and mines to support your economy. You then build race-specific ships to combat your opponents.Gameplay tends to get stale very quickly, however. And although there are three races, they all have the same tech structure and ship style, and few changes. I rated this game a bit higher because you can have multiple human players on the same computer, and offered me many good childhood memories. But if your looking for a refreshing and exciting game, maybe you should skip this one."
4,Love the feel!,One of my favourite brands and designs. The odd shape feels good to use and is reliable protection.One star off because it's still not as good as without. ;)Hard to find retail anymore.
5,The part that got me...,"The bootlegger hands over a dubbed copy of the Disney cartoon ""Lady & the Tramp""""Is the movie suitable for a child?"" the woman asks seriously."
1,Flimsy and poorly constructed,"This product worked fine for three whole days. It provided UV index readings and calculated exposure time based on UV readings, skin type, and SPF. Unfortunately, the device was extremely flimsy and poorly constructed. It could not withstand the turbulent forces of being placed in a backpack with other objects. The screen became unreadable as ink splotched its exterior. If you care for the product like a new-born, you may have some luck with it."
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"I was under the impression this was going to be an English translation of the Kularnava Tantra. I was disappointed when it arrived to see that it actually consists only of an Introduction by Arthur Avalon, ""Readings"" from the Tantra by M.P. Pandit, and then the Sanskrit text. Pandit explains in the Preface that ""Portions relating to rituals, technicalities of special types of japa, etc. have been kept out of the treatment so as not to tax the aspirant of the present times..."" Note: I found what looks like a full translation by Ram Kumar Rai, even rarer than Avalon's edition. Don't know how good it is, but it exists."
4,"Beautiful song, great production","This is a very international sounding release from Australian trio Bella.I use this song to check out PA systems, it's a good one too see howthe treble is going to come out (SShe SStill Believes...).All kidding aside, this is an awesome tune, soothing & rollicking,well sung & well recorded :)"
1,Skip this book,"The book cover states that the book is lavishly illustrated; the cover is but not the book. It is not up to Yale standards.The photographs are small and blurry, often the colors are incorrect.Please wait for a good Catalogue Raisonne. As for the text, so many years of good research wasted. The text is ponderous, poorly written with endless sentences full of quotes and inserts.The author is critical , judgemental and constantly makes assumptions or gives personal and mostly unsubstanciated opinions. It is another book for Art History students (the author is an Art History teacher) not for lovers of paintings. I returned the book to Amazon."
4,Conversation Piece,"Arrived on time and intact. I was worried about the rattle in the box but was the liquid filled (and sealed) thermometer. As was stated in earlier reviews, all of it should be handled with care (safely move the glass to another location and then move the base). I would recommend a windowsill for presentation.The thermometer took about 30-45 minutes for the sealed liquid to come to room temperature. It is referenced at 10 degree increments (Fahrenheit) and indicated 64f to 80f. The globe that has to be filled with water is delicate, but can easily be filled with the included syringe and fill tube with water and food coloring of choice (I liked blue).While not as accurate as myWeems & Plath Weather Stationgauges, it does provide a good indication of weather conditions. Also makes a good conversation piece.Wish the base came in darker wood. I can make that though."
3,Galileo Thermometer/barometer,"I ordered this as a gift for my husband. It shipped well, however, the overall presentation is good, not great. There is more assembly required than I thought and I would have preferred a more substantial thermometer and think this duo is more appropriate for a young boy or teen's room rather than an office."
1,Great item but bad packaging!,"Chaney needs to redesign its packaging. The foam box the globe barometer came in did not protect it from breaking off. I looked forward to playing with this colorful toy but was disappointed that the globe was broken, which I've read that happened to a few others. So I contacted amazon and within 5 minutes, a rep contacted me and refunded my money. Love you amazon! Bottom line, order it and hope that you're lucky and nothing is broken."
1,didn't work at all,All the glass balls were sitting on the bottom regardless of temp and I left it for a couple days to see if it would change but it would not.I suggest a different brand.
1,"Not worth the money,","Way to small for the money, fair quality, should have been half the price. Very hard to read, my daughter has a larger one and paid less.With much finer quality"
2,terrible quality control,"Received the product the day before Christmas. The platform the items sit in was not drilled properly the glass globe barometer wouldn't even fit in the stand until I took an 1/8 inch of wood out of the diameter of the ring it sits in. Also the glass globe has an uneven base so it sits uneven, had to add sand to the recessed ring in the platform to get it to sit evenly.terrible quality control"
5,Love It,"you will enjoy this fair priced weather station in your home. we love it. i catch everyone in the house stopping to observe the weather station, its fun to see everyone figuring out if there is a storm comming or not."
4,"Arrived broken, getting replacement","It came quickly and looks nice, but the thermometer is broken, and Amazon curiously does not allow returns for this item! However, after complaining to Amazon they are replacing it."
3,No directions,I bought this as a father's day present for my husband. He loved it except there were no instructions on how to put together the barometer or how it even works. :(
4,Good gift for nerds,"I bought this for my boyfriend who's majoring in atmospheric science. He gave it four stars but personally I would have given it five. It's a nice size fitting on most shelves, attractive, unique, and fairly acurate considering it's pretty old technology. I imagine this would not be a good gift for kids- it's very fragile."
3,Looks cool!,"We bought this as a birthday present for my 11 year old. He is very into meteorology and science. The Galileo Thermometer and Glass Ball Barometer look great on his chest of drawers. The thermometer seems to work perfectly. The barometer; however, has not worked as well as we hoped. It's possible that because we filled it a day or so before a storm came in that it started at the wrong level. It's been three weeks and we are not yet able to establish a pattern between what the barometer does and what weather comes."
5,Galileo Thermometer,This was really an excellant find because it suited our gift to our outgoing commander because our bonus for each year is tied to a thermometer.
3,Galileo Thermometer with Glass Ball Barometer,"It's amazing to watch the glass ball barometer show high and low pressure. It's been really accurate, however, the galileo thermometer does nothing. The globes sit at the bottom and don't move at all. I wish I had know this before purchasing I would have only ordered the barometer."
4,Neat,"Barometer is kind of useless and for show only. The thermometer does work and is nice.(also the continents on the globe are clear, not colored like some of the figures show)"
3,"Thermometer doesn't work, Can't return to Amazon","Update: changing review from 1 star to 3 because of Amazon; after writing original review, they somehow find out and issued me a full refund the same day! I think Amazon is simply amazing. I guess you just take your chances you hope to get a good one.Original: Looks good enough, but the bobbles for the thermometer just sits at the bottom, don't float like they should, UNLESS I put the in the refreigerator. AND I CANNOT return this item; something about harzard materials by Amazon. I guess I've a defective desk piece."
4,Wonderful Addition to Home,"I always wanted one of these and after not receiving one for Christmas, I ordered it myself. I love the thermometer, and the barometer looks great with colored water in it. The only thing I did not like, and this is a matter of taste, is the finish on the wood stand. I would have preferred something darker, but I can make my own base if I want to. Looks great in my living room with light filtering through it."
5,My weather station,"Shipped quickly and in perfect condition. Great shelf piece for looks, weather prediction (as good as the weatherman-maybe he has one!), and conversation piece. Educational for your budding scientist!"
1,It arrive defective... Amazon will not take it back...,"It arrived defective. The 80 degree bulb does not float and holds the others down. Amazon will not take it back due to flammable item... What??? They will ship it, but not take it back and will not refund my money! Poor form Amazon!"
1,beware of return policy from Geroy's,"Beware! This item arrived broken, since it is fragile. Geroy's and Amazon refused to send a replacement, but did give me a refund. I now can't buy it again at the same price, in fact it is about twice the price. This store should know better than to ship glass items and not offer replacements for breakage. Beware of return policies for this particular store."
2,Well...,Item was finally received after several inquiries....damaged. I'm going to take the loss and I won't be ordering from this company again.
3,Caution when ordering from Chaney,"I ordered this product at the very beginning of December. Despite being notified of its shipping, I never received it. I tried to contact the company to cancel the order and get a reimbursement, but they have not responded. I'm sure the instrument is a nice one, but I don't plan to order from this company again.January update: the item came after I left for my parents' house. I unpacked it to see if any parts were broken or missing. The thermometer works fine, and though the barometer is a little tricky to fill, it works fine too."
3,missing parts had to return it.,Purchased it for my nephew for his birthday and had it shipped directly to him. When he called to thank me he said it was missing a part of one of the temp numbers. Quality is questionable.
5,Got this book today of the bargain rack,"Filled with some great color photos and a lot of modern photographiers that are not always looked at. A beautiful picture of a rose in the center, some cute pictures of monkeys, and alot of powerful stuff."
2,This is ok,Just wish it had more christian prayers than catholic prayers and more topics.I am a little disappointed with it. The biggest disappointment was that limited amount of topics.Suzukisue
1,Read it just like the title says,"This harness is the pigtail from the main harness. Do not buy this one if you are putting in a head unit. You need the female side harness, this is the male."
2,Not for mailing,"There is an extra 20 cent charge for hand stamping the ""mailer"" envelop. Apparently, the automated cancellation stamping system cannot be used because of the flimsy envelop. Some of our recipients complained that the CD's were cracked. It should not be sold as a CD/DVD mailer."
1,500 500 6x9 WHITE POLY MAILERS ENVELOPES DOESN'T MEAN 200,"WHY IS THE PRODUCT 500 6x9 WHITE POLY MAILERS ENVELOPES BAGS, AND YOU RECEIVE LESS?"
4,utilitarian and stylish,"Got a pair in black about a month ago and have been using the shoes regularly. very comfortable right from the get go. I think the shoes look stylish too. Its too early to say if the shoes are durable, but I expect to wear them for at least a year."
1,Used,This shoe shows definite signs of being used. The heel of the shoe is worn and the writing on the inside of the shoe has been rubbed off from use. Terrible!
3,Fills like 1 size larger than indicated,"I'm a big fun of Bostonian shoes as they provide light weigh and very comfort shoes.It was my first time online buying shoes, but because I couldn't find wide models in the retail stores, decided to take a risk and order thru Amazon.Recieved product with no delays and overall the shoes were as expected comfortables, but the only problem is the size - it was too much room in the toe area.So, had to return them back."
3,Shoes are Great but Delivery will Kill Ya!,"The shoes are wonderful and fit well! The problem is it took almost three weeks to get these shoes. The company says it is UPS's fault and that may be, but it is still a long time to wait. I will say that the company was friendly and addressed and researched the problem promptly."
4,Great Information on a little studied topic,"I have been searching for information offered in this book for years, and I must say that the authors compiled genuinely interesting studies comparing the Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual experiences across cultures and genders, to include the heterosexual population.Initially, some of the data was challenging to absorb (I am a psychotherapist, not a psychologist!), but I pushed on to find this book to be the best of it's kind so far."
3,NSP and St. Croix,The book has a definate Left bias but it is still a very good read and illustrates the importance of community involvement in protecting a river. In this case it is the St. Croix River versus a coal fired power plant. The plant was built along the shores of what was called the cleanest water system in the midwest. The book delas with the ways in which public involvment forced NSP to change some of the plans for their plant to be more environmentally friendly.
5,My Scent,"I have been wearing Elizabeth Taylor's Passion for many years. Every since I first tried it, Passion has just been My Scent."
2,Disappointed,"Although it arrived ahead of schedule, the product itself is disappointing. It does not last long after sprayed. I've been buying ""Passion"" for years and have never had this problem."
5,Beautiful scent,"My wife loves this product. I buy it for her often. I would highly recommend it. Great product, great price."
1,NO HE RECIBO EL PRODUCTO,ESTE PEDIDO LO HICE DESDE EL 30 DE NOVIEMBRE Y TODAVÍA NO LO RECIBIDO ESTOY EN ESPERA DEL MISMO DIOS QUIERA Y LLEGUE PRONTO
1,Does not smell at all like Passion,I ordered this product for my wife for Christmas. It did not smell anything like the passion that she has been wearing for many years. We are very much disappointed in the product.
4,Frame By Frame,Marg Helgenberger in an earlier role (CSI currently). You definitely get to see 'a lot' of Marg (adult material definitely - murder and sexual encounter). Not for children but very suspenseful and exciting!
1,A horrible movie,"Marg Helgenberger plays the weakest, most stupid heroine ever. Starts out good until her partner's wife is killed. Even though she is under attack by a sexist co-worker, she allows her partner to sleep at her house with her the night his wife is killed, then has sex with him. She steals evidence. Earlier she watched an exchange between a source and her partner and didn't even ask what was in the envelope. Not a good movie. Not a good role."
3,Review Conundrum,"The movie was in excellent condition and the picture quality is very good.The only thing I have had difficulty with is it's in German. This is fine as I'm part-German but unfortunately I don't speak German, only English and French. I cannot seem to activate any subtitles or different language options. Otherwise it was delivered as stated and its condition was very good."
5,A must read for this issue.,"Yoshimi did much of the ground-breaking research, and this book shows the results. He writes like a true scholar: presenting the facts he discoverd and giving a clear reasoning for the conclusions he draws from then. He is explicit about his own convictions, but keeps them separated from the facts, carefully avoiding overstatements. Japan can take pride in this historian."
4,Sturdy and Good Quality,I have backed several loaves of bread with the pans (2 of them) over the last several months. All have turned out wonderfully with uniform baking throughout. The pans are easy to clean and don't stick to the bread at all.The one downside is the non-stick surface does get damaged when you stack the units within each other. The outside corner of each pan is rather sharp so it scratches the inside corner of the other pan.
1,I'm Done,"I'm done with non-stick. The coating on this pan has started peeling off, just as it did with Kaiser's and Chicago Metallic's non-stick. I'm going back to tinned steel. (My experience with cake pans, including springforms, has been the same.)"
2,Better than nothing I guess,"It is alright I supose. But it left out major classes and often cominded multiple classes into one. the experts are way to short. The things idisliked most where the lack of overall info on major navies plans, and the leaving out of future ship classes coming on line."
1,"it's ""painful"" that I actually paid for this book","Out of the whole 180 pages of the book, you're lucky if there's 10 pages SPECIFICALLY addressing oxy & prescription addiction verses addiction in general. even when you read it as a general addiction book - it's pretty superficial (main treatment suggestion is 12 step program)& not quite accurate - first chapter premise is that addiction only happens to people with genetic predisposition &/or ""trauma"" issues...how about the fact that some substances are highly addictive regardless of the others"
4,"Good, but not what I was looking for","The book was great. Very informative. I craved the information contained about dealing with addiction, especially as a family disease. However, specifically I was looking for information about a specific drug, Oxycontin. With oxycontin in the title I was assuming there was a wealth of information contained within regarding the perscription painkiller. However, there was not. So although I enjoyed the read, it wasn't really what I was looking for."
3,Not bad.,"This book was ok. I am a drug counselor, so some of the information I already knew and some other information was helpful. What I didn't like we're the brief examples of characters attempting recovery that were presented in the book. Too brief, which makes it appear too simple. Doesn't express the true challenges and set backs in recovery-like lack if motivation for some people. It was all presented too easily- recovery doesn't work that way. But I liked the historical information and science."
5,EXCELLENT pan!,"I've owned my Calphalon Brownie Pan for 6 years, and absolutely LOVE it! I'm ordering a 2nd & 3rd one today. We have the largest toaster oven that I could find, and this pan fits in it. We've used it for everything from baking fish, making cinnamon rolls, baking cakes, broiling steak, garlic bread, cookies.... and I think we've made a couple of batches of brownies in it. With 5 kids, it tends to rotate in and out of the toaster oven a LOT, and has held up wonderfully. I'm ordering 2 more so that we don't have to wash it 3 & 4 times a day. (It DOES go through the dishwasher, too! And that's a HUGE perk at our house!)"
5,excellent pan for brownies,This is the second one of these pans that I have purchased. We have 2 homes and I liked it so much that I bought another so I would have one in both places. It is perfect for any brownie recipe for a 13x9 pan. The brownies bake up perfectly. Just remember to line your pan with parchment paper that hangs over the narrower 2 edges. You will be very happy with your baking results.
3,Not easy to clean,I had to buy a replacement for my toaster oven as the original was very crudddy as it would not clean easily. This one is the same so I just use aluminum foil on it when making things. Not sure why they are hard to get clean.
5,Good Choice,I enjoy this while I work. It's smooth and easy to listen to. Good late night mood music. I have gotten a lot of complements on the disc.
4,This is Dub!,"Clearly Laswell wanted to genuflect at the feet of King Tubby and Lee Perry, and he creates music that is part imitation of them and part extension of what they had done (there is at least a small amount of cross-in electronic sound). If you like King Tubby, you'll like this.Laswell's secret weapon here is his bass. He drips fluid and funky bass parts the way Charlie Parker used to drip saxophone runs. The bass playing lifts this record up and makes it something at least a little special."
3,strawberry,I purchased this bag as a gift. She likes handbags and has not had any complaints about the structure.
5,Helps with doggie waste,This product is used in the Doggie Dooley waste eliminater. It really helps to keep the yard cleaner by breaking down waste into a liquid that can be absorbed safely into the soil.
2,Do not use outside of USA,"As a Peace Corps volunteer part of my duties are to teach English to my community. I purchased this book because I have little background in teaching. I had hoped this book would give me meaningful guidance. It fell far short of this.This book was designed with a very ethno-centric point of view. The pictures are of things most Americans would be familiar with but when I tried reviewing the pictures with some of the Thai people in my community they had no idea what the objects were in either language.Most of the pictures are crude and get worse if you try to reproduce them. The entire idea of a book like this is to provide reproduceable study material, otherwise what is the point?If you are in my situation, teaching to people outside of the U.S., Then this book is not for you."
1,"Monotonous: no bedouin, no class","There is no lack of talent on Badawi's label, there is just a lack of inspiration. The monotonous sounds may provoke instances of bewildered gasps for air from the listener. When is it going to happen? Maybe that is Badawi's motivation? It left this reviewer wondering why he ever bothered listening to the entire album. Not recommended!"
4,Good Shoe/Sneaker,I work in a hospital so these shoes are very nice because they are easy for walking. The only downside is the arch support isn't what it could be and so I have to alternate between this shoe and another or I get sore feet.
2,Too Narrow,"I bought this shoe because of the great reviews it had. I am not satisfied with this product at all. I ordered the wide fit and it seems that they sent me the narrow. They run small, you should order at least half size bigger."
3,Dancehall At Its Finest,For all of you who grew up during the late eighties and early nineties. This CD offers all of the best dancehall reggae classics for the listening ear.
1,Junk,"This is absolutely useless. If you want to hear a good Bohemian Rhapsody, buy A Night At The Opera by Queen. Don't buy this even if you are paid."
4,Remote cable works fine,"This does what I need it to do, but Olympus sure is proud ($$) of their stuff. During the recent meteor shower, I was able to sit in a chair next to the tripod and snap pictures. The one small complaint is that the button was more sentitive than I expected. Just brushing it against something, particularly when moving the tripod triggered unintended shots. Overall, a good, but spendy, product."
1,Waste of money,"The main problem is that the elastic does not go completely around the leg opening, making it very uncomfortable because the leg opening without the elastic stretches as a result any physical activity. Definitely would avoid this product."
3,unhappy consumer,"I purchased this value 6 pack and had them shipped to my sister who has a US address. She in turn shipped them to me in the UK. Well, I put them into the washing machine @ 40c then into the tumble drier on delicate and they shrank about 3 sizes, I'm unable to wear them now.When I first saw them they were perfect size 32, with good high rise (I have an ileostomy) and have great difficulty finding good unerwear with high rise. Clavin Klien used to do them but for some reason have stopped.Should I not have tumble dried them??"
2,Rock out with your ...,"Exclusive Y-Front? Exclusive for a reason. Every other manufacturer has realized that the Y-front makes it trivial for things to, err, fall out. Perhaps it's just the way I'm built, but I frequently end up ""rocking out"". This is most unpleasant in public, because there's really no discreet way to put things back in their place. I'll stick with Hanes, thank you."
2,Not true to size,"These Classic Briefs did not run true to size; too small. If you are used to buying this brand, perhaps you should consider going up a size in this particular style. The workmanship is fine and what was expected."
5,"Tidy Whities ""Rule""",Great product - great service! Would definitely buy through Amazon for our Jockeys again!!!
5,Easier than the store!,"I have always like the plain, white traditional Jockey briefs. The last time I tried to buy them at Macy's I couldn't find them. So I bought some of the colored Bikini style. When I needed more I went on line and found the ones I liked at a good price on Amazon.com. They arrived quickly and are just what I wanted."
2,Quality Decrease,"Jockey is a good company, the quality of the selected item not as good as expected,or as good as past purchases."
4,Exactly as advertised.,"I bought these and paid more than the others cost because they are the only ones who give you a size in inches. The rest to the ""small, medium, large"" bit. I find the size varies on these between brands."
3,Wish the material had been a bit heavier,"I would actually give the item about three and a half stars. I like the design, and they are comfortable, but I would really like to see a thicker material. Time will tell if the elastic holds up and how long before the material starts to wear out. I would be willing to pay more to get higher quality."
1,Not as good as they used to be,I've been wearing the same model of Jockey brief for 20 years. They literally let me down. The elastic in the old briefs is much better and they keep me supported (I still have a few in the bottom of my drawer that are really old -- different color writing and the tags are worn off). The bottom line is that the new ones have lousy elastic and they let go after an hour of wear or so.
5,Jockey Classic Full Rise Brief 6-Pack Underwear (32 White),Excellent product (very comfortable) and an exceptional price.
1,Description of the author's personal account,"This book does not teach any techniques to arouse and verify the Kundalini phenomenon. It is a personal account of the author, of the Kundalini phenomenon and some comparison with similar experiences of others. The only idea I get out of reading this book is that Kundalini rising through spinal column and coming back is only of one type, the other type being that the Kundalini energy having reached the top, returns from the front. This book talks about some higher worlds to be reached through meditation. It does not integrate with the thought of human psyche. The presentation and understanding is dualistic. It does not confirm to the highest truths of Advaita Vedanta at least in summary. Of course, to me it is similar to reading a paperback, and not a revelation of final Truth which I AM."
1,WAYYYYYYY OUTDATED,"Ok, i dont know when this DVD was really made, but its OLD... the information is un usable. For instance, at one point he recommends a computer with a minimum of 128MB of RAM... thats when I stopped watching... not worth $10 much less $40"
2,"All emotion, no facts",My title really says it all. Rollins has strong opinions but apparently he didn't use any reason and logic to come to them.I agree with many of the ultimate conclusions that Rollins has so I'm not complaining because I don't like his point of view. It's just that you aren't going to learn anything by watching the show other than maybe how to raise your voice and look angry.
1,You can not return!,"I ordered this item based on the great rating it got, yet when I received it I was unimpressed and found the size measurements to be wrong. I ordered a medium based on the manufacturer's notes yet when received found I needed a longer one. After researching how to return, since it came with no information on this, I found out you can not return this product from this store. I wanted to warn everyone before they purchase."
3,didn't work well for me,"It's a high quality item for a decent price, but I could never get us comfy in this shape of carrier. It doesn't support baby's back enough for me to go hands free. I think my son slept in it one time, but I wasn't ever able to relax. I am happier with a meitai style front carrier, or the Ergo for hip carrying."
4,dark sci-fi,"this anime is a great dark sci-fi show it is part end of the world,part bionic man,and part bloodey battle. this is allso a thinking man's story no dialog for cver a minute after the story opens this is on purpose to let you take this darkworld in. i thought this was very good if you like sci-fi,anime, or action i think you will like this itis very much it is allso a story. about the human spirt as well this is dark and bloodey so it is not for little kids or the squimish."
1,schlock,"Pointless, poorly written, poorly animated. Story(and I use the term very loosely) spends most of its time hashing and rehashing the same irrelevant points, while totally skipping really basic story questions. The characters do countless pointless and even idiotic actions for no reason whatever. It's like watching a four hour Russian film, but less exciting and far less entertaining, but with all the grim and pointless suffering -- mostly the viewers."
5,IT MADE ME LAUGH,"I really enjoyed ""EXPERIENCE THE POETRY OF A HEATHEN."" Thisis by far the best book that I have read in the last 10 years. It made me laugh and also it made me cry. All kinds ofemotions arose inside of me as a result of reading this bookof poetry. Everyone who likes poetry should read Euphrates Lois.Experience the Poetry of a Heathen takes you on a therapeuticjourney where you can find peace, serenity and hope."
4,FUN!,"'Here Comes Heavenly' makes for good, light-hearted reading. The plot is interesting and not heavy and boring. The characters catch you with their vibrant descriptions and you really want to read on, and find out more about Heavenly Litebody, the mysterious nanny who suddenly appears. Where did she come from? Who exactly is she? and so on. It's very fun. I finished it and I wanted to read the sequel immediately!"
1,njb,"This product is very small in size....may be my own fault for not reading the fine print, but the picture makes it look normal size and it isn't. I had purchased it as a gift for an elderly person and ended up returning it. The print was small, but also didn't think their hands would be able to work it very well either."
3,Not exactly what I expected.,"I cannot say it completely met my expectations because it is a pocket edition. I was expecting regular size or I would not have ordered this one. I saw no indication online that it was pocket size. However, it is a nice little leather bound New Jerusalem Bible, so I will keep it."
3,Smaller than expected.,"I had a previous version with a green cover that was a little larger in both size and print. However, this is perfect for carrying around."
1,very disappointed,"I found this book nearly unreadable....I had read a review of this book and had expectations that it would be an interesting historical novel in the tradition of The Piano Tuner and Fragrant harbor, two books that I had read recently but instead this book is composed of fragment of diaries and German military archival material. There is very little ""story"" and what little there is I found disjointed and diffcult to follow. This may be due to the translation but I think not -- I would not recommend this book at all."
2,I hoped for more,"I was given this book by my boss because we were about to work on an internationalized application. She wanted us to consider doing it with Visual Studio .Net.Unfortunately, it it did not work out that way. I agree with the other reviewers that the writing is quite good, its not that. The problem is that there is so very little there. There are too many things that this book simply does not cover. And this is from an expert?I am now doing a lot of research: in MSDN, websites, newsgroups, and elsewhere. Things that should have been here in this book. I am really disappointed in APress for not making the author do the work here so I would not have to."
2,A disappointment. The book is very 'padded'.,"I'm currently reading the book ""Internationalization and Localization Using Microsoft .NET"". The topic of this book is one which I'm very interested in. Unfortunately, this book has been very disappointing to me.When read a book on a targeted technical subject, I like to read something which is concise and to the point. Preferably with many useful examples in the text.This book fails on both points.The author often wanders off topic in a very conversational tone and there is an entire chapter on Visual Basic 6, which is not .NET. This would be fine if I was reading a book on a general topic which benefits from anecdotes and humor. But this topic is one where I want to get to the ""meat"" of things and move on. I think with a good editor, this book could be reduced by 100 pages!I've also found the example code to be trival implementations of the subject, with almost nothing which could be re-used in a professional environment."
4,A Real new York Legend BUSH TETRAS RULE!!!!!!,"I could not believe the whippersnapper above comparing the bush tetras with Bikini kill. Ha!! Bikini kill * W I S H E S * they were in the same league as the Bush Tetras ((by the way, the reuninted band will play a gig on feb 24 here in NYC).I Am old enough to remember them playing live in 1981 So cool so real so perfect in their time. Myself and half of the other straight guys were in love with the butch dykes that ruled downtown with everything one could hope to have= real style, Intelligence, wry humor, poetry, good music and defiant politics.They did not become big because of their in-your-face lesbian sensuality. I remember when ""Too many creeps"" came out, everyone was like ""hey who are these women, and what are they saying?"". Sadly, heroin took its toll and members went downhill and destroyed a great band...Do yourself a favor. buy this record.This is the real deal."
4,"PJ Harvey with a hint of funk, before PJ Harvey","This is a very good collection of rock music. I know little about this band, but was very impressed when I saw them as a warm up band in 1998 (years past their prime?).It's not sweet, and is tough in large doses on headphones and/or an office environment, but if you can get yourself speakers and a little distance, it's very solid. Like most rock it takes more than a single listen to get what's going on. It's not harsh on the ears, but it is a tad cranky.If you're an alternative commerical radio devotee you may not get it. You may not be able to have your Cake and like this too."
4,Very good!,Now this is really seminal post-punk new wave. It sounds like a lot of stuff you have heard by now but back then it was completely new and fresh. It still surprises me how innovative most of these new york new wave bands were.
5,Very Nice Book,"What an absolutely delightful book this is. First, the cover design is sure to catch the eye; it is bright and inviting, wooing you to taste the morsals of spiritual wisdom inside. What is this work about? How to live a better life by living the Word of God. This is done in a non-preaching way, light-hearted yet packed with the truth of the Word of God. We have topics such as words, worth, and relationships and we have questions, answers and tips to help along the way. The format is a personal, easy to follow read and draws you from one page to another.All in all this book is a big winner. It's real, it's fun and will be a jewel in any readers hands, young or old. Highly recommended!"
5,Best product bought,I don't like buying shoes through the internet because not only are my feet big but they are thin and I always have problems with any type of shoes. But this time I really needed training shoes and decided to try my luck. I was very surprised and satisfied with my purchase. These are the most comftable shoes ever. Thanks.
3,Only for the true fans...,"I have been listening to Die Ärzte ever since my trip to Deutschland, and they have some very good material. However, I must say that this album was far below my expectations for the band. With the exception of about 3 songs, the album as a whole should have never been released. This one is only for the true fans..."
3,Its a bit thin.,Not bad but not that great.Its only a few pages thick but the stickers are great colors etc.
2,"well played out, but mundane","Many of these stories are old hat, but the acting was very well done. for someone just entering the fascination of the paranormal and it's related stories, this is one of the BETTER ones. If I had to pick a DVD to see these episodes for the first time, I wouldn't pick anything else first!"
1,CD-ROM attached never worked,"Only seven problems in the practice exam works, after that everything is messed up. Something wrong with the CD. AMAZON's service is A+, they sent me a new one immediately but the CD has the same problem. Checked with different computer still did not work. I believe all the CDs with this book have the same problem. I did not ask refund because of the good service of AMAZON. But disappointed at Kaplan."
2,SAVE your $$$ on a better book,"I was able to get through this book in only 2 days!! This entire book offers the reader ONLY strategies and no review of content. For some of you, this is what you are looking for, BUT the strategies they offer are all common sense. I have confidence that, if you were able to graduate from nursing school (ADN/BSN), you have ALREADY mastered the techniques they have to offer.If you are looking for a good book that offers strategies I suggest using ""Saunders Strategies for Success for the NCLEX-RN Examination.""For a good book that reviews content I suggest using ""Saunders Comprehensive Review.""If you want practice questions you should use ""Lippincott's Review for the NCLEX-RN Examination"""
1,Test Taking Tips not Content Practice,"If you are looking for a book to help you learn how to take a standardized test then this is the book for you. However, if you are looking for a book to help practice content in prep for the NCLEX-RN, do NOT use this book. Saunders suits that purpose much better IMHO."
1,Might as well not have a CD,"From the number of people who seem to have had problems with the CD-ROM, Kaplan might as well just sell the book without it. Mine didn't work at all. I take my boards in a few weeks, so I can't say for sure yet how helpful the book alone has been. I have done all the questions in it (I wish there were more). I am using Saunders also. I have tried everything I can think of to get the CD to work. I have tried contacting Kaplan several times and they don't respond. They seem pleased just to have gotten the money and have no interest in follow up. My Saunders CD works fine however."
4,happy2be,"I actually have the 2004-2005 version, but it still helped prepare me well for the RN test (I took it a few days ago). This book is useful if you want to know how to get the right answers on the NCLEX RN test. It does not review nursing concepts and disease processes, but it is very useful to use in combination with another nursing review book. A good one that I used was the Incredibly Easy Guide to NCLEX-RN, if you want a review. If you want to know how to pass the test, get this one. The questions at the back of the book were the most useful to me as far as passing the test goes. I had 3 different CDs of questions and found these to be the best(after passing the test!). The format of these questions are closest to the kinds of questions on the test. Other CDs I used (NCLEX 3000, etc) are good, but better for the PN test."
4,The guy at the end of the bar,"I've been a fan of Ken Nordine's word jazz for almost 40 years; I've been a fan and (I hope) friend of Rich Herstek for only 4 or 5 years, but this is the real item, man, the genuine article, coin of the realm. It's hard to like and easy to love, like a lot of people I know. Rich has been in all these little dives, and though he doesn't smoke, he'll light yours for you. Thanks for the album, Rich; like someone said of Ken Nordine, you're the light in the refrigerator."
2,Don't need to see it.,"I have seen Colin live probably more than I have seen any other artist. I love his shows. I have seen him before he met Cecilia Noel and I'm actually going to a Hay/Trapper show on 9/8/11. I love the solo acoustic stuff and the band stuff. I much prefer just Colin with a guitar and no band, but a full band rocks too. What I cannot stand is when there's just a few players and Cecilia dancing around. I seriously have to look away or just close my eyes and enjoy the sound. Knowing that she's on the DVD, makes it an easy PASS for me, but then again I live in LA and am fortunate enough to see him often. He doesn't always bring her, but it's never noted... kind of a crapshoot."
2,Lackluster at best,"I'm a dedicated fan of Colin Hay's work, and was eager to own a video to be able to demonstrate to others why I'm a fan, but this one will not do the trick.This is a very low-energy, lacklustre performance. A video of a performance needs to present something worth watching, and while these are all faithful reproductions of great Colin Hay songs, this could just as easily have been a CD, as there is nothing to look at here.The performances are rote, with very little of the engaging banter from the stage I am so familiar with from Colin. The audience is comatose. The venue is miserable. The band is crammed into a corner against a white wall with lighting more befitting an elementary school class performance than a professional artist's DVD release. The venue could have been overcome by a great performance, but that's just not the case here.Colin remains a favorite, but he needs to find a far better performance and producer to achieve a DVD worthy of his talent."
2,better without the f-bombs,"What a great musician! He came to town this year and I was ready to take all my kids to see him, but at the last minute, we couldn't go. So I bought the dvd so we could all watch it together and enjoy him in concert anyway.....wasn't prepared for the f- bombs. Colin, clean up that potty mouth and you'd have another generation of fans!"
3,Dude needs help,Wow. The single star dudes don't seem to be able to buy anything they like !! Need help ? Or maybe get another life !!
2,"A rehash documentary, a badly edtied show... skip it!","Up until now, I had never imagined Scorpions to be one of those bands that would release a bad official DVD on the market. Unfortunately, that's what we have in this DVD.Choppy edition, a old documentary made for German TV included in the DVD. It's not a doccumentary made for the DVD.Very weak release..."
1,Waste of time and money,"Although their last studio offer, UNBREAKABLE, was a pleasant surprise, this DVD lacks the quality of its counterpart CD. Edition is atrocious, cutting from musician to musician in less than a second, the whole show."
1,One night to forget.,"Due to bad edition, this DVD by the greatest German band of all times is almost unwatchable. The sound is strong and crisp. What ruined it all was edition, by someone called Anna Hausing, something like that."
1,Totally disappointed... almost useless...,"It hurts me to tell this about a beloved band of mine, but it's the simple truth. What went wrong with this product? There are two MAJOR problems:1) Headache-inducing edition. The sound is perfect, you can feel the band is in top notch form. The only trouble is that you can't watch them! Each frame lasts sometimes less than a second, it's awful, it's boring, you can't watch Mathhias Jabs perform a solo, you can't watch the drummer complete a drum roll. It's not Unbreakable, it's Unwatchable.2) Simply by viewing the musician's clothes during the songs, you can see that they used footage from different shows in the same song!! This is so annoying!!I already sold my copy of this DVD."
3,I can see it both ways as most reviews stated,Like the title says I can see it both ways. The video is busy and they do show way too much of the drummer even when there is a guitar solo going on. Whats up with that?A drummer should be heard and not seen for the most part unless its his time to shine. The music is good the video quality is good as well. I like the Scorpions so I can overlook the rapid video changes. Overall its good but not great. I have seen better. But I'm not completely disappointed with it.
4,Unbreakable world tour 2004:One night in Vienna (SCORPIONS) DVD,"One thing I learn about reading some reviews is that is not allways the case,you have to be a fan first and then the critic,reviewers have different taste in music was it the video? was it the audio?this is an example I won't even mention the reviewer's name but this is what happened keep in mind that every reviewer deserves respect first of all,He gave Michael Schenker a low star score but he gave Madonna 5 stars so you see he wasn't a guitar player fan,in the case of this DVD I think it was a pretty good DVD for the concert the videos and the interesting interviews I kind of balance the reviews and most important to check the profiles first before you make the decision to buy the item or not!"
4,Not perfect but good,"The rockumentary is great with cool old footage. The live footage is not as good as worldwide live, but still good. and it proves that the last studio album ""unbreakable"" includes fantastic tracks that fit directly to old classics from Blackout, Love at first sting or Animal Magnetism."
3,not so stung,thought this would be excellent...turns out to be average....wacken is better performance ....bio and extras are very nice and make this package worth getting
3,Not bad DVD,"A good representation the Scorps live show.Although their live shows pale in comparison to the studio work (I've seen them three times live) this is a very good representation of their live show.Excluding ""Humanity Hour 1"" (not written by the scorps, what the hell were they thinking?) I can't really think of a bad album.If you're a fan, this DVD will be right up your alley !!"
1,Love the 2.1 better than the new ones,"I have the 2.1 Version and a friend has the 3 version. I updated to 5 Silver and my friend also reviewed it. We both feel that the 2.1 and 3 are better. They are much easier...seems to have more variety of cards. I would like to be able to buy another 2.1 or 3 for other friends for whom I know 5 would be too confusing as it certainly is for me. If CreataCard would combine either one of these with more cards and programs, ok.I was thinking about 6 but don't think so. Am happy with my 2.1 and will try to get to know 5 better but am not as happy with it as I had hoped."
1,Disappointing.,Was looking for erotic stories with perhaps new ideas for my relationship. Nothing of the sort here. Kinda' silly stories and voices used.
4,Dbx 231 Equalizer,great DJ product to reduce feedback and enhance sound...used it for mic channels and subwoofer and main speakers
4,Works fine,This has worked fine for what I use it for. No problems yet. Use it for live shows for a three piece band.
2,be careful if you own a 2x AGP,"This card is not compatible with 1.0 compliant AGP. The confusing thing is you think 2.0 compliant is 2x, it is not. I called costomer service before buying this card. I had asked if 2.0 compliant was the same as 2x, she said 'right', that's was her only word! She odviously didn't know what she was talking about. I like Creative products, it's not that, I have the SBLive X-Gamer and it's excellent but I bought my PC only last year and this Anhilator 2 should be compatible with 1.0 slots but it isn't. Most other top of the line cards(Voodoo 5) are 1.0 compliant and AMD super7 compatible. I give it an extra star because it is said to be good on 2.0 AGP systems. No stars on mine because it doesn't work."
3,Easy to setup. faster to burn out,"A great card, a bit expensive here. Look at Tomshardware.com for comparable cards. I owned this card and ran it in a high end, well ventilated tower. This card runs HOT!!! I mean to the point that the heatsink couldn't be touched!!!! The heatsink is cheap and Creative Labs may as well let you put your own heatsink on. Mine burned out in under a year and that's without playing games on it!!!! If you buy it, get some fans to blow on it!!!It get's great ratings, is a bit expensive, but you get what you pay for. Good video quality. But Creative Labs did themselves wrong by placing the chip at the bottom of the card. Heat rises and the card heats up. A little redesign and a quality heatsink and this would get 4-5 stars."
5,You -have- to buy this :),"I just bought this video card.. and wow. If you play any sort of 3d game other than unreal Tournament, this is the card for you. I had a voodoo5 5000 before and the geforce2 is a lot better, and faster. It supports OpenGL and Direct3D just fine. Also, with the newest drivers from nvidia it supports Full Screen Anti-Aliasing (FSAA, what 3dfx has been bragging about) for almost any game, making it look incredible. It is expensive for just a video card... but if you buy it, you won't regret it."
5,Fantastic Knife,"I've had mine for about a year now, and have (ab)used it in every way I could think of. It's held up perfectly. It can only be sharpened using a diamond sharpener but that's the trade off for holding an edge forever and being ridiculously strong. The Eagle sheath seems unreasonably expensive, but it's extremely well made, versatile enough to attach to belts, tactical webbing etc. and has a little pocket on the outside that holds a SureFire L4 perfectly. Very happy with this purchase."
3,seems to capture the Heartbreakers doing what they did best,"Johnny Thunders was clearly one of rock and roll's great beautiful losers (a compliment). His artistic triumph was the great, at times genuinely moving, So Alone. But here, he and his bandmates/drug buddies simply do what that seemed to do best - crank out one highly catchy, energized punk or oldies tune after another for a clubfull of their devotees. Like Lou Reed in Take No Prisoners, Thunders also was notorious for his moments of audience baiting (going back to his NY Doll days). This record captures some of this typical ambiance of a Heartbreakers show. There's even some bonus CD tracks, making this a must for any serious fan of honest, back top basics punk-rock"
5,Insight into living with chronic illness.,"Ms. Klein establishes important rules to live a fruitful, productive lifestyle, despite a chronic illness: Live life by celebrating life. Independence is control over one's own life measured by the quality of life sustained with whatever help is needed. Sometimes dispair can lead to depression. Sometimes, it can be motivating."
2,This the third time he has written this book,Bartov has written two earlier book on this. Those two were nearly the same. This one is yet another repeat. That is how how academics build their resumes. Save money and read his earlier work Hitler's Army.
1,very disappointing,"I thought this would be a wonderful way to carry my son around during the first few months. He was completely engulfed in the fabric and I was worried that he may suffocate. Then when he got bigger, I couldn't figure out how to get him into it properly. He was either about to fall out or would have his face smashed against the carrier. The Baby Bjorn was much better."
3,There must be something better out there,"I was disappointed with this carrier. My newborn was consumed in it, meaning he was buried within the material. I couldn't see his face, and I was constantly worried his nose might get blocked.Also, I found the material rough. It's not a soft cotton; it's more like a canvas.Lastly, the carrier also ended up hurting my back after about 40 minutes. In the end, I returned it. I just couldn't see myself comfortable enough with its safety and structure to use it much."
4,"The Definitive ""Pines Of Rome""","I concur will all the reviewers who said this is one of the best ""Pines of Rome"" available. It still is yes. I never heard the third movement ""Pines of the Janiculum"" sound so fresh. ""Fountains of Rome"" also receives a great reading from the Reiner and the CSO. I'm withholding a star primarily for the mediocre reading of Debussy's ""La Mer."" I'm afraid this piece has been bettered many times since this recording. Boulez, Martinon, Tortelier, and Dutoit own this composition as far as I'm concerned and I haven't heard it bettered by any other conductor.I would say that if you want to hear an outstanding ""Pines of Rome"" and ""Fountians of Rome,"" then you will find very little to complain about with this superlative recording.Note: I have not heard the SACD layer of this recording, but the CD layer sounds fantastic."
1,terrible tape,Absolutely terrible tape. Not at all what I expected in terms or quality or amount ... did not last the time I expected 25 rolls of tape to last ... in fact it only went as far as one roll would go. DO not order this. only shipped 1 tape instead of 25 tapes.
4,Lovely braclet,"I recent had gotten this for a birthday present. Since it will fit to the size of your wrist, great is you have skinny wrists when most bracelets won't fit. however I do not recommend wearing this when moving boxs etc as I lost my first one when having a lawn sale. I did however order another because I liked the first one so much."
4,MALTESE CROSS Celtic Irish Silver Tone PEWTER BRACELET,Bracelet is very nice. Overseas delivery was very prompt. I'm very happy with the service I received
4,No need to be a music lover or a physicist.,"I do not include music or physics among my interests, yet I enjoyed MOW. The book really makes you think about the way things are (or appear to be). Since this book is about a musician, and you do read it as opposed to listening to it, the author wonderfully conveys the essence and the power of music. For this alone this book is a must read. After reading of one of the concerts in the book, I was left absolutley floored as the narrative was that powerful. This was the first KSR book I have read. I was very impressed with the connection the author made with me. KSR uniquely addresses the reader at various points throughout the book and that added to my reading experience. Some of the physics theory really slowed me down as I struggled to understand as much as I could. All in all a very engaging and thought provoking work."
4,"Hard science: Social, Physical, and Aural","I really adore Robinson's work in general, so am not surprised that I also enjoyed this book. It's definitely not his strongest work, but in a SF field filled with putrid tripe, this book is like a glorious orange blossom.It does tend toward the science more than the characters, which seems unusual in comparison to Robinson's other work, but the science is engaging, and the sociological facets of the book (always Robinson's strong suit) are riveting (the wide variety of cultures represented throughout the Solar System ring incredibly true).One caveat: As a caucasian male with a shaved head, it's rather uncomfortable to read a book entitled ""The Memory of Whiteness"" in public; I often felt as if others were pegging me as a neo-Nazi due to the ambiguous title. But maybe I'm just being overly PC."
2,This book came highly recommended by a respected friend.,"I adore music theory, physics, and science fiction, so I dove into this book excitedly. A third of the way in it was a painful slog through and I had to fight to get to the end. So disappointing. A couple of the characters were worthwhile, but the insipid plot overshadows them and I can't recommend this at ALL as a result."
2,Never became engaging...,"Johannes Wright is the Ninth Master of Holywelkin's Orchestra, a magnificent machine that produces music. Every so often, The Orchestra, with the Master, tours the Solar System to perform. However, during this tour, there are those who want The Orchestra, or the Master, to fail. The originator of The Orchestra, physicist Arthur Holywelkin, may have left behind a legacy that most can never understand.I'm a fan of a number of Kim Stanley Robinson's books (Mars trilogy, Antarctica), but this one really never left the starting gate. The Orchestra always seemed like a weird device in a time of advanced physics. Wright was being chased, The Orchestra was being threatened, the planets and asteroids had their own unique cultures...I expected more."
3,I Wish,"I wish this book had had more vampires, devils, and fairies, which is what I was looking for. What was in it was very creative and made me rethink. All Christopher Hart's books seem to be worth their weight in gold and have helped me tremendously, even though he sometimes jumps ahead in his technique without giving the beginner more instruction on how to do that! Anyway, I am delighted with this book; it has things in it I wouldn't have thought of. Still looking for funny vampires, though."
2,"Viriety is the spice of life,but can't be found in this book","Not really what you would expect...This book would have been so much better if it had viriety, it had fantasy characters in it but its mostly stuff thats well...boring, thats is the only word i can think of for it. The only section that was worth the book was the unicorns, i mean most of the characters are mounster fantasy, they only had one fairy in it and it look like a bug , and only one kind of angel which was, a fat guy with yellow wings, the mermaid look like a 5 year old drew it. its really not worth the buy just go to the libairy and check it out, in a day you will have it read."
3,Nothing Special for me,I don't feel it numbed me enough... I ran through three o these in no time. And I was pretty tipsy.Hell I almost have to inject myself with novacain or someting I guess..
5,The Pioneers of Hardcore,"They say punk has no memory. That styles and influences are forgotten only to be brought back by the next generation as something brand new. The Bad Brains break that trend with the immortal ""Bad Brains"" album. Every track is a blueprint for the hardcore sound. Sure there will always be arguments about other bands that came before or since but the Bad Brains not only laid it down in the studio but continue to tour today. Definitely a must buy for both musicians interested in the sound and fans interested in the music."
5,exellent,"Exellent hard punk rock, by far alot better than todays punk,very original, very good hard sound and good songwriting."
4,I really did enjoy,"I really did enjoy this old western movie, the story line was good and the stars are all good actors"
1,Our Town,"I sent you my review when I got this dvd but I guess it didn't go through as I couldn't find how to send it.I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A LOUSY COPY AS THIS ONE. I WILL KEEP MY ""EYES OPEN"" IF I SEE IF ANY DVD MARKETED BY PASSION PRODUCTIONS BUTTERMILK ENTERTAINMENT AND REFUSE TO BUY THEM.This outfit must operate from the basement of some dinghy place. They even cut off the head of Martha Scott in the cemetery scene at the end of the movie as they did with some other heads in this rotten dvd.I threw this dvd in the trash where it belongs !!!Please don't offer any more trash dvds as this one.Thanks.G. Gonzalez"
1,I hated it!,"I hated this book. When the authors weren't manipulating the way they presented statistics so that everything was the worst this or the most frequent that, they were asking more rhetorical questions than providing useful information. Even my professor, who had no choice in the textbook, based the final exam entirely on her lectures - thankfully there was no real need to finish reading the book!"
5,Wow. awesome.,"This is one of the best concerts I have heard, musicians are going to love this dvd, the music is so well arranged, Terrence Palmer on bass is awesome and really anointed, Israel is so anointed, and all his songs are really great. The cameraman on the dvd wasnt all that good, but the music is really awesome, from beginning to end. I love this dvd, I recommended to all who like Gospel or praise and worship, and I recommended to all musicians."
2,Not her best work,"I love Lori Wick's books, but was disappointed with 'Wings of the Morning'. There were too many happenings and unlikely decisions made that kept the heroes apart till the end. It made me crave a quality novel that has romance and adventure without silliness."
5,The best!,"This was one of the best books I've ever read. I couldn't put it down, I had to know what was on the next page all the way through. I love books like this that keep you intersted from cover to cover! I had to read all of this series!"
5,Nice light strings,Changed to these on a new mandolin. Much easier on the fingers and they sound really bright. I use similar strings on my guitars also and have not found any thing else that I prefer playing.
4,A great mandolin,"It is a great mandolin for beginners, high quality with affordable price. We really like it and recommend it to everyone. You may need a tuner though."
1,Really Bad...even for Full Moon,"Wow, this one is bad.....really bad. Once you take out the credits it runs about an hour. There's about 30 mins of content padded out to an hour. Probably 2 sets, 6 actors, and less plot than Killer Eye 2. Easily could have been filmed in one day. Makes Gingerdeadman 3 look like Transformers and that was actually cheesy fun. I know Eric Roberts isn't an A lister, but dang he stooped low for this one- Charlie Band must have thrown him some cash. Again, an ending that almost isn't even an ending. Incredibly awkward and ludicrous - definitely skip this one. I had hope for this one being cheesy fun with a 'name' actor in it, but its a waste. Not worth the $1 at Redbox."
3,Intriguing Debut by Stunningly Talented Author,"I am a bit of a China-phile, so it was with great anticipation that I read Gail Tsukiyama's WOMEN OF THE SILK. Her spare writing style provides the perfect foundation for the spell she weaves in this story of sisterhood and self-discovery. Pei's journey from unwanted daughter to independent woman as war looms over China is a fascinating one, and Tsukiyama's first novel is impressive, however, I think her talent and story really comes together in her second novel THE SAMURAI'S GARDEN, which is dangerously close to being a perfect book. It is interesting to see how she develops as a writer from WOMEN OF THE SILK to her next novel. The seeds of brilliance that shine from these pages glow like pearls in THE SAMURAI'S GARDEN. Tsukiyama is an author not to be missed."
1,Predictable,"Clumsily written. I don't know her basis for the silk factory scenario, so I won't comment on that, but all the personal stories of the characters were cliched.I read it in 2 days, because I simply started skipping a lot of it once I gave up on it being interesting."
3,Women of the Silk,This book was not as compelling as The Samurai's Garden but the theme was interesting. I was not motivated to continue with the writer until I understood that there was a sequal to the unfinished story of Pei.
3,Interesting if you have an interest...,"I am fascinated by China. I admit it. I read everything I can about the country, the people, and the recent past - especially as it pertains to women in the society. So this book was something that met my criteria for a potentially good read.I enjoyed the book a good deal....but more because I wanted to learn more about life in China than that it was a fascinating or particularly well written book. (Wild Swans, for example, I think would be fascinating whether you were fascinated by China or not.)"
4,Women of the Silk,"A sensitive, portrayal of women in China in the 20's and 30's. I enjoyed reading it and will seek out other novels by Gail Tsukiyama."
2,It could have been so good.,"I don't leave long through reviews, but overall this book just had some parts that were ridiculous (even as fiction) or not needed for the plot. It had great potential, but overall I was disappointed."
4,Lovely but quiet,"This book gave me much of the same feeling as ""Snow Falling on Cedars""--that of very lyrical description. I actually liked this novel better because it knows that's what it is and does not try to force a lot of fast-paced action or intense drama, as ""Snow..."" did. Instead, it moves much like a dream. A good bathtub book."
3,Good Book with Minor Problems,"This is a truly wonderful story that may be universally applicable to all women, though it centers aournd Chinese silk workers. It addresses freedom and independence vs. family constraints and forced passivity. It is a story of women coming in to their own identities, and for that it is valuable.Nevertheless, the writing lacks sophistication. The author does a lot of ""head-popping"" within scenes, and so it can lead to confusion about point of view. Additionally, there are several contradictions and inconsistencies within the background and framework of the story. I found these problems to be VERY frustrating, and I thought they impeded the flow of the story."
3,"Good story, poorly told","Like so many other reviewers here, I have read many stories set in pre- to post-revolution China. There was a fascinating twist in this book, namely the class of women working in the silk factories. These unmarried women broke many taboos and lived unusual lives.Unfortunately, the writer never brings the women or their times to life. She narrates the story in a dry, cliche-ridden manner, with stilted, unnatural dialog. Even the ""dramatic"" climax comes and goes without much drama. It's like a show-and-tell with no ""show"" ...I sincerely hope her subsequent books delve into equally interesting topics, but that her writing skills develop to a level that can do them justice.In the meantime, I would recommend ""Wild Swans : Three Daughters of China"" by Jung Chang, ""Bittersweet"" by Leslie Li , or anything by Amy Tan.Barbara"
1,What is it??,"I lost my copy of an incredible compliation that has 12 unique versions/enterpretations of Stairway To Heaven. This posting does not say at all whats on it. If it is the same STairways to heaven where all musicans take a familair melody and insert the words from STairway to heaven.Yes it sounds deranged - It is. Its also funny, in some cases, outright brillant, if you can get past the humor.Who ever is in charge of posting items, it would be greatly apprecated if we got a COMPLETE summary. Thanks"
5,It really does work,"After reading Alvaro's review I started taking LS7 in August, I have lost 13% body fat, and have not suffered any side effects. I have reccommended it to several friends and they are steadily losing weight."
3,So So,"This was OK, but just OK. One dead pixel, no driver on CD (Had to get it from the ACER support site, didn't matter because the quality wasn't improved. Spend a few dollars more for a Samsung or Viewsonic."
5,good reminder of what its all about,This book is great as it has helped me realize why i play the trumpet and helps me drop any ego i have. I enjoy playing the trumpet and it is truly easier to sit down and just practice something now because of the books great view points and explanations. great book for any musician
4,Highly recommended for musicians of any instrument or style,"I'm a drummer, and although Kenny is a pianist, the principles still applied.He's a jazz man, and I prefer and play Rock, but his message still propels me to recommend this book. The only reason I rated 4 instead of 5 stars, is that I am Christian, and some of his ""lessons"" will definitely conflict with that faith. Disregard those passages, and you're still left with awesome material to internalize, and learn from."
4,Promising,"I just finish reading this book. I can relate to what the author says in many levels including being overwhelmed with my study materials and being intimidated with my musician piers. I can see how the meditation may improve my confidence. I would love to give it a go, although I am very mindful that it may take few years before I can see how the meditation practice would have any noticeable impact on me as a musicians. Nevertheless I recommend this book to other musicians."
2,It means well...,"Sorry, but I just couldn't take this seriously enough for it to be helpful. I can see the point it's trying to make about positive thinking, but I actually found the CD rather funny,especially when it says ""Relax your kidneys"" How on earth do you do that? Perhaps we Brits are just too cynical."
2,Incomplete Package,"This is a terrific text potentially capable of guiding the reader through improvement of his/her performance. However, it is wothless without the CD. I received the book all right, but WITHOUT the crucial part for practicing and/or meditation - the CD.The Amazon did not specify that the book includes the CD and did not forwarn the purchaser before finishing the sale that this particular book is missing this important intrinsic part.The book without the CD is useless. I wasted my money.I would change my opinion of Amazon and the book should Amzon complete the package and forward to me the missing item."
3,Underdeveloped but servicable,"I read in one of the reviews here that this soundtrack was recorded before the cast even went to Broadway, which makes my complaints with this CD understandable. The performances are quite lackluster. Susan Egan borders on forced-genuinity and at times sounds a bit too --I don't know -- like a voice for a Disney channel ad, for example, when she sings the line, ""I love the funny way you stand out from the crowd"" in ""No Matter What"". When the Beast is dying it's downright pacifying. I have seen clips of Susan's Belle live and she is amazing -- her voice much richer and natural as Belle and her acting superb. This CD does her no justice. Terrence Mann's voice isn't deep or powerful enough for my taste but he does a nice job conveying the Beast's despair with surprisingly effective gentleness. The orchestrations could be richer and just a tad faster."
5,Time to throw out all of my 300 golf books and keep this one,A very sensible approach to cutting your handicap! The author maintains that he only has 3 months to develop a winning team; and he can't screw with swing planes etc. He needs to improve the teams scores. He lays out the strategy nicely.Best $ I ever spent on a golf Book!
4,Great advice for the weekend golfer,"Crosby's book has lots of good tips on improving your game for beginners, occasional players, or those who don't like to practice (99% of us). He also, which a lot authors miss, explains in terms usuable regardless if you are left or right handed. I especially like the section on keeping stats; even after a couple of rounds, I could see immediately which areas I needed to work on. Only quibble is the book has a little too much Tiger (the photos in the middle of the book add nothing). Wish I could have given it a 4.5."
1,slippers,product looked nothing like pictured and came as socks not slippers as listed. I did not have time to return them before my event.
4,Very edgy,"I own a lot of flamenco chill CDs and this one probably ranks as one of the more edgier discs. I dig it, it's very different. Your friends will say, ""what's that! it sounds pretty cool."""
5,Tonic Sol Fa Yay!,"We first heard Tonic Sol Fa live when we were living in Nebraska. They are an awesome group and their tight harmonies and impeccable rhythm are a joy for the listener. If you like totally a capella singing (with a very few small percussive instruments, mostly bass beat), you will enjoy this dvd."
4,"Very good, but they'll get even Better!","Tonic Sol-fa will improve when they learn that they need to have greater variety in style. The Bass is great, but does too much Bass Fiddle (walking bass--One-man rhythm section) stuff. Give him more solos; feature him more / be his backup group. Also, the group needs some rubato/legato goosebump harmony numbers (a la some of the old Hi-Lo's acapella songs)-with really sensational chords (with perfect intonation, of course)!!--just for contrast to the terrific rhythmic numbers. Tonic Sol-fa must be accutely aware of the sensational Take-6 group which does the ""walking bass"" thing more perfectly than any other vocal group in the last 50 years. Even the great Take-6 came to realize they needed more variety! -YOU ARE TERRIFIC! -(but Greatnessawaits you.) !! STUDY the Hi-Lo's CDs and the SINGERS UNLIMITED 7 CD box set. These are the Gold Standard.Yours, Paul Sjolund"
3,Super Reader,"Where Captured by the Engines is a horror novel, this is a thriller, as Batman plays Bat and Mouse with an assassin, or more like big ugly nasty rat than mouse.Specter is an international assassin of spectacular success. No one can catch him. He is hired to deal with an informer who is a key witness at trial to put away a South American crimelord.The first part of a book deal with some police and FBI politics, and recaps Batman Year One.The rest is the law enforcement types desperately trying to find this man Specter. Batman kidnaps the witness to keep her safe in the Batcave, and calls for help from people he has saved in the past, taxi drivers, an Asian citizen vigilante group, his sensei, and others.This allows the good guys to catch a break.Specter, however, as well as blowing people up to cause chaos is hunting Batman.This ends in a confrontation, and the female witness is involved."
5,Perfect,"No frills, fully functional, easy to use and install.A Quick flip of the module and any channel is normalled or de-normalled."
3,Reaching For 5 Stars and Missing,"I have small law office network (NT server, W9x clients) running fairly standard law firm software: Wordperfect 8.0, Timeslips 8.0, Quickbooks Pro and the Wingate internet proxy server (allowing all computers to have internet access across the network through a separate firewall and server).As a printer and copier and as a scanner and hand-fed fax machine the G95 gets typical high marks for a Hewlett-Packard product -- 5 stars.However, I encountered *severe* install problems and operational software conflicts when trying to use the unit as a network fax machine --which is, I think, its primary attraction. HP very much needs to get the machine's tendency to conflict with standard network-compliant software fixed and documented.So -- only 3 stars from this reviewer because of the tremendous problems we've had getting this otherwise fine machine to work with our existing network and software. Although, we're back up and running this week...so far."
3,Great Costume,"Great costume. My grand daughter love it. Highly recommend this supplier. Costume was so true to style of dress my daughter had on her doll when she was a child. She got a big kick out of seeing her own daughter in it. Funny thing was, my daughter trick a treated as Strawberry Shortcake when she was 4 years old. Here daughter was 4 this year and we didn't realize it until I was looking at old pictures."
3,"Great, Initially","I loved these dried strawberries. In fact after I started munching on them right out of the container I had a hard time stopping. It was sort of like eating potato chips, ""Bet you can't eat just one!"" The only problem I have had is that once opened you probably should get rid of them quickly because the container lid just does not keep out the moisture and after a relatively short time you are eating something less than dried berries, more like potato chips which had laid around open for a few days."
1,The evil fruit of 21st century decadance!,"What kind of sick genetically engineered horror is this?! Both a tomato and a strawberry, it must have been devised by some mad scientist and loosed upon an unwary world.And it's being sold with the usual slipperiness of the product naming industry. While being of both tomatoes and strawberries, it's advertised as Just, or solely, both of them.Don't fall for their corrupt science and sophistry!!!"
2,LES BARBOTINES,"A GOOD INTRODUCTION TO FRENCH MAJOLICA. LOTS OF COLORFUL PHOTOS. TEXT IN FRENCH. FOR THOSE WHO CAN READ FRENCH VERY MEDIOCRE HISTORICAL NARRATIVES FILLED WITH ERRORS. NEVERTHELESS, VERY GOOD FOR ANTIQUE COLLECTORS WITH LOTS OF GOOD PHOTOS TO HELP IDENTIFY ORIGINS."
1,USED DVD re-sealed in plastic and sold as new!,"This DVD arrived OBVIOUSLY re-sealed in plastic, the DVD box broken, and the disk severly scratched. It is OBVIOUSLY a used item in poor condition that was represented as new and sold as a new item."
4,Understanding Folk Religion,This is an excellent book to give an understanding of different worldviews. Particularly useful in understanding people with animistic beliefs.
4,Great but!!,Its great if you like brand name dvds but its b the same as the others out there for less money. All I can say is its your choice what you want..
2,DVD's,"forget about ordering these with your camcorder, It took about a month to get them after my camcorder came in, go to walmart and pick them up for less money."
4,Good price and quality,"Works good for regular use on my DVD camcorder,good standard quality media for a reasonable price.I use the discs along with the memory card which records at the same standard DVD quality.They work well together."
1,This Stuff Doesn't Work,I have had RA for years and thought I would try this product for relief as described on the infomercial. After 5 days on the product I had to stop because I was in more pain than before I started taking it. I was so dissappointed because I had high hopes. The sad part is when I tried to call to get a return number for my refund (you can't get a refund without it) I couldn't get through to their customer service department. I was on hold forever to the point that I just gave up and hung up. If you want to place an order you get through immediately. I hate these tactics that companies like this use. They don't want you to be able to get your refund. That alone makes me not trust these people and I wouldn't suggest anyone order this product!
5,Great book for pigeon enthusiasts,This video has 'secrets' which were unknown to my step father who has been flying for over 50 years. He thoroughly enjoyed it.
4,"Good price, good reliability, and so far so good.","Does everything I need it to. I have 30mbps internet, and it is getting the same speeds as the one built into the motherboard. No internet drop outs since I've installed it. What more can you ask for, especially for the price. I only gave it four stars because I've only had it installed a month or so, with it being so cheap, I'm not sure of the reliability. If it lasts over a year, for the price, it's 5 stars, but that's yet to be determined."
5,Good Card.,"A friend of mine's computer went dead. His older computer did not have an RJ45 port for fast internet. This card worked great! He is running an older machine, a 333mhz, running Windows 98!!!!!!!! At least now he can do some web surfing, and get his email. This was a great, little, quick, emergency fix.Make sure your cable is secure in the socket, it might be a little loose."
5,Startech PCI ethernet card,it arrived on time. was recognized immediately by my computer and works great. the price is very fair and I would recommend it to anyone.
1,DOA out of box,"This device didn't work at all. Also the driver disc doesn't identify which drivers are for which devices. (IE: The phrase ST100S is not mentioned on any drivers, and there are a lot).Went to their website and downloaded the drivers. The folder for XP was empty. (Even though XP is supposed to auto install this, nothing I tried worked). Refund was instant and I didn't have to return defective product!"
4,Multiple Install options,"This network interface card comes with 2 slot plates, one normal for regular computer chassis and the half plate for those smaller form factor chassis. Wish more manufacturers did the same."
5,"Easy to install, does what it's supposed to do.","I am running Windows 7 64-Bit and right after installing, it worked.I didn't even have to use the driver disc, and so far it is running really well, no problems or anything.My old ethernet motherboard jack burned out on me, and this was the perfect replacement.Great product, does what it was meant to do, can't ask for more than that."
2,Not all created the same,"One of the sellers of this item is shipping a slightly different card. The seller says that this card is ""AKA MOTOROLA LPC810."" But, beware-----this card (the Motorola version) is NOT the same as the Startech product. It does not work in Macs!!!! The seller was quick to refund my total purchase amount, and that was nice, but he was really reacting to a low rating that I gave him. I maintain that this was misrepresenting the product because Amazon Customer Reviews clearly say that this card works with a variety of Macs and the one he sent doesn't. Don't make the same mistake if you have a Mac!! Frustrating, and of course it took a week to find all this out."
4,I wish I had written this!,"Couldn't put _Evolution's Darling_ down. I loved the depiction of our machines achieving sentience. I loved the extrapolation of how the world might cope with it. I loved the sweetness and strangeness of Darling's character, and enjoyed the way that Westerfeld imagined the possibilities for S/M play in a world where physical damage is more easily repaired than in ours. Then I looked at how he imagined the economic realities of the world he'd created, and I felt a bit envious of his abilities. But I didn't dwell on that too long; I was too busy enjoying the novel. Well done!"
2,Weird,"I got this book from the library because I love Westerfeld's YA science fiction and fantasy books. This, I didn't like so much. I couldn't really connect with the characters, I didn't really care about them. It didn't have anything to do with the fact that one of them is an artificial intelligence - I've read numerous other books with AI characters that I liked or loved. This seemed more like an exercise in how many weird things could be packed in one short novel. And there was a lot of sex. Really strange sex.I did very much like the end of the book, but it didn't make up for the rest of the weirdness."
2,It is a joke,"This flare nut wrench is a joke. I tried using it on steering gear 18mm nut. The wrench does fit nice around the nut. Nonetheless, when you try to break loose a tough nut - the two sides of the wrench box will start going apart, ultimately becoming wide enough for the wrench to skip to the another set of sides on the nut. In other words, the walls of the boxes on the wrench are too thin to handle any serious job. I ended up stripping the nut with the wrench, but luckily was able to use a regular non-flare wrench on remaining sides to undo the nut."
5,Dr. Willey is awesome!,"I love Dr. Willey! He is the most awesome music theory professor! Plus, he writes a hell of a string quartet! This recording is WONDERFUL! To anybody who's ever taken Dr. Willey for any class: you NEED this CD! :-)"
3,"Ambitious, yet flawed","Close to Home (Karov La Bayit) ends with an, assumedly, Arab man being pummeled to death by a crowd, over the objections of the two protagonists. We don't see the beating, as the filmmakers choose to not portray violence on screen. (An earlier bombing occurs off screen and we just see its relatively benign after effects.)While Close to Home is about two women doing their obligatory duty in the Israeli Defense Force, the filmmakers appear to have two agendas, one a simple coming of age theme and the second, women caught up in a ridiculously male-oriented organization.Viewers of any gender will alternately identify and reject both lead characters and their peculairities. In that, is the strength of the movie as the filmmakers aren't afraid of making both leads human, even if it borders on stereotypes (the timid rule-follower and the brash rule-breaker.)For exposure to a world and country that is seldom featured in movies, Close to Home is worth a look."
3,Worth reading,"This is the second book I have read from Connie mason and she has not disappointed. I really felt depth in the characters and their problems. A lot of historical romances are a lot of fluff,but I could see and feel from reading true anguish from the characters. Especially from lord Lyon and how he had to internalize looking weak in front of all his men. I liked how Ariana had to deal with falling for a man that lead to the destruction of her people. It was a good story."
3,A good book by Connie Mason,"The thing I love most about the hero is that he's jealous and possessive. He would give up his honor to save his wife from being another man's wife. Though, he ends up blaming her for it... which I believe she should have made him crawl for forgiveness at the way he treated her, but it still turned out to be a good read.I'm thinking Connie Mason books will have fans like me wanting to read about alpha males and their love stories But I STILL can recommend better stories written by many other different authors that will leave you breathless..."
1,Flimsy,"As others say in their reviews, it's flimsy. Also, the clear plastic ring at the base fell off after its first use."
2,"disappointing, difficult to operate","Difficult to make corkscrew stay straight in the cork. Enters at angle & breaks up the cork. Also, it's not as sturdy as expected. I've been opening wine bottles for many years with no problem, using the standard inexpensive corkscrew that everyone owns. Thought Italy might produce a better product than China. Wrong."
3,Kelly...cmon...,"He could have done better.There are only a few good songs on this CD such as In the Kitchen, Trapped in the closet, and a few others. Some songs are corny while others are just plain dumb. What happened to his great ""I Wish"" daays? R.Kelly we want you back...you hear?"
4,This is the closet truth,"Talk about drama. I think that Mr Kelly has a neck for writing a soap opera. Cos trapped in the closet is one of the best soaps I have ever seen. It is well acted and has gotten people talking. I think that this track is the core of the whole album.I don't even know about the rest of the album, for me it is very avarage.I really do look forward to where this story continues to.Hey Kelly go talk to a tv station about making a proper series of this whole song. A musical soap, that's genius."
2,Yall Know Da Truth,"Okay, being a big R.Kelly fan, I can be real a give u exactly what Kels gave me and dat wuz nothin. I'm sorry but afta they played all of da parts of Trapped N Da Closet on da radio, I got pretty tired of it, and I bought da album thinkin I would get way more dan a DVD, but of course, I wuz wrong. I hate he named dis album TP3, bcuz dis wuz a horrible follow up to da masterful Twelve Play and TP2. Kels needs to really go back to actually writin songs instead of givin u dis wild and crazy person he portrays himself as. Look out fa da Trey Songz album comin, dats goin 2 b a real drop yall. Holla at Ya BoI!!!!!!"
1,"TP should sand for Toilet Paper, cause this record is CRAP","No words can express how terrible this record actually is. What has happened to the old R. Kelly? The one who gave us smooth jams, sexy grooves with meaning, and properly produced music?I cannot believe that after all the support that his fans have showed him he has decided to release this load of crap. Not one single good track!!! I can forgive that from a new singer, but from an R&B; veteran???Big let down. This will hopefully be his last CD, cause it truly reeks."
1,dumb,"I haven't heard most of this album just the closet saga thing. And wow what a massive pile of crap that is. My 7 year old sister writs better lyrics than this man.I saw it on TV and will admit R kelly has made some ok songs in the past but this whole thing is just dumb. Lets start with the lyrics bad bad bad. And as for the ending when a guy comes through the door. Errrr is that supposed to be shocking or something. Get with the times man.I cant believe this has been released or that anyone would even like it. My advice Go out and buy some real music with proper lyrics like Juliana hatfield, the early feminist music by liz phair or any singer or band with original thought provoking lyrics. This stuff belongs in the bargain bin."
4,Regular Ole Pied Piper,"I could listen to ""Remote Control"" all day. That song is so soulful for me. I got ready to quit my job, went on break, listened to that song, and calmed right down. That's how serious it is. This cd is a regular ole R. Kelly cd, full of soul, laughs, and freak nasty lyrics (Note: R., it's okay to leave some details out...I really didn't need to know you toss salad). The ""Trapped in the Closet"" DVD was entertaining and the guy who plays the woman's husband did a great acting job. The only problem is once you know all five parts, you're really not trying to hear it again. It loses its flair. ""In the Kitchen"" and ""Kickin' it with your girlfriend"" were great songs too! I didn't care for ""Playa's Only"" or ""Happy Summertime""--too cliche. But other than that, this cd is just what I expected--a great listen.On ""Put my T-Shirt On"" at 3:51 time frame, I could listen to him do that ""Eee ee ee ee ee ee"" over and over again too."
2,R KELLY'S WORST ALBUM!,"R Kelly's third instalment of the Twelve Play albums is downright horrible.Listening to this album gave me the impression that he lacked inspiration while he was recording it.Most of the songs are crass and forgettable.The only highlight of the album are the melodramatic chapters of ""Trapped in the Closet"".Overall this is a below-average album."
2,What happened?,"This is NOT what I expected from R. Kelly. The songs do nothing to express his true writing ability. Listening to this album, I was amazed at how boring it was. The most exciting cuts on the album are In the Closet. There is really nothing else about this album that stands out. He could have done much better."
2,Where is the Real R. Kelly,"My mistake, I must admit, was falling for the name of the cd TP3 Reloaded. Before my purchase I'm gearing up for a cd that's loaded with slow jams much like 12 Play(...). Boy was I wrong. Reggae, Reggaton and other fast tracks kill the mood of songs like ""Sex(Love is what we makin)"" & ""Touchin"". We already knew about ""Trapped in the closet"" & ""Sex in the Kitchen"" so there are no good slow jams other than the previous two I mentioned that really grab me but even those are not true R. Kelly classics. I'm giving him two stars only for his rep, (as a musician that is)."
2,Only five good songs on here,"And they're all titled ""Trapped in the Closet"". Okay, six songs: ""Hit it Till the Morning"" is pretty good. Other than that, this album's trash. The rest of the songs sound like Kelly being a shadow of his former self. Stick with the original 12 Play."
4,R Kelly is smart,"People say R. Kelly is a really horny dude and that could be true but one thing is true is this guy is really smart. He know's that sex sales and that's the theme. Nope this is not near his best work but you know what you are buying when you heard those silly singles on the radio. I was entertained by them. ""Sex in the kitchen"" is a wild song.Nobody does it like Mr. Kelly...I just can't wait until he get back to real music making and stop clowning around but him clowning around is still better than some of the others in this genre. Oh and this sounds like it could be a porn movie sound track."
3,((This is the Devil with the talent to decieve)),"Ha I'm a brother and I have to say that there is a bit of bad timing for this album. We are living in an age were we are facing an epidemic! And this album is not helping the youth nor others at all. His talent is there but, it's misleading and heading the wrong direction! I do like the Trapped in the closet production, because it really emphasizes the scenerios people face in life. It's a wake up call for all those who are sleeping. I listened to the album and it's strongly sexual I think he could have set a better example for us all. There is not one track on that album which he states in using protection.TP2 was a much more low toned erotic album which I think most people could listen to and not feel like they gotta go out and bang a prostitute! lol.... But still R kelly is still r kelly even in this album and like I said nothings different about his style or talent just his direction!Note: If this weren't R kelly I'd give this a single star."
2,More 3 not enogh TP,I'm a hardcore kelly fan and i have every cd. This album has its r-kelly moments but he should have chose another title for the album. 12 play and TP-2 were creative albums and had a sex feel to them. this album you actually have to search for it. there are 19 tracks and about 14 you will never listen to after the first time. ovarall as much as i love kel's music i could have saved the money to get a haircut or something. If you love kelly buy it if you think he is okay then you wont miss much. I expected more from kelly. ALOT MORE!!!
3,Too many expectations,"I love R Kelly's music, but this album has toooooo many other people on it. I would rather hear him at his best and that is alone. The album is good, but not the quality I am use to. He just wrote Hypnotic for Syleena Johnson and Charlie, Last name Wilson for the legendary Charlie Wilson, so my point is where did that spark go on his on album. I would buy this at your own risk. You may like it, but me kinda disappointed. All in all still love to here this genius at work. VA Holla"
3,Ok!!!,"While the other reviews are great, I didn't think it was that great of a CD. I love how different in the closet is. R Kelly is truly creative. As for the other songs on the cd is just ok. Same beats same types of songs. This CD can not compare to TP2 or even Chocolate Factory."
1,Insulting!,"There was a point when I would have proudly said I liked R.Kelly, unfortunatly that all finished after the last decent album he did ""R.Kelly"". This album is just terrible, no other word for it. Monotonous drivel served up by R. to make some more money out of his loyal fans under the guise of another ""12 Play"" album. Yeah right!For one making 5 'chapters' of the same song is just rediculous. R seems to be all out of ideas these days and seems to want to insult us by releasing this rubbish. R&B; is in a state and R.Kelly seems to be leading the charge, what happened to all the soul? What happened to somebody actually writing a song that meant something? I'm tired of defending R&B; music and I give up because albums like this just make it impossible. In fact nearly every album realesed these days makes it impossible. Goodbye R.Kelly, you've insulted this fan for the last time!"
1,The only good thing to come of this will be,"another hillarious parody from Dave Chappelle, are you people listening to the same thing I am? this is TERRIBLE, don't support this cradle robber"
1,I thought he was a changed man.,This must be the record for quickest backslide I've ever seen.He went from U Saved Me to a potty-mouthed melodramatic soap opera that has already gotten old. This all shows he wasn't sincere about his spirituality. All the praise and glorifying was just relief of being given a free pass for using the wrong thing as a urinal.I admit I was intrigued and entertained with Trapped in the Closet; but the continuations are just getting more and more ridiculous. To continue to extend the installments until you eventually get to Chapter 100 (which seems to be his plan to hear him tell it) is unacceptable.
1,Music Has Gone To Hell,When I listen to this album it makes me think how in the world did music come to this. All I have to say is that this is horrible. There is nothing good about anything on here. If you're a fan of R&B/Soul dont even think about looking here because this aint even music. The quality of everything nowadays is devesatating and sad. I dont know were music is going but its getting worse and worse each and every year.
2,wack,"I have always liked R. Kelly's music. When he produced ""Trapped in the Closet"", I thought it was a joke. This is one of the stupidest, corniest, and blandest song I heard."
4,Good Album,"I enjoy the Slow Jams on this set. the Whole Trapped in the Closet Saga is Ground-Breaking&truly One of a Kind. what can you say about R.kelly? he is the Greatest Artist Ever to me.the Man is a Musical Genius who knows Melody,Rhythm,Groove&timing. He has no Peer.I dig the TP2&12 play Album a Bit more overall but this Album is Good.can't nobody touch this Man. He is the Best Songwriter,Producer,Arranger,Vocalist&Musician going."
1,All his music sound the same,Every album sounds the same. The same beats and almost the same lyrics. I can sing any song over every song he has. He's not a genius. He never challenge himself. I saw the In the Closet video. Looks like an old standard Chi-town building. EVERY player in Chicago knows about the law that there has to be 2 exits out of every apartment. He wouldn't be stuck in the closet if he just went out the back door. Jeez.
1,THIS CD SUCKS!!!!!,"I've been a BIG R. Kelly fan for a while. I know Kelly is know for his ""baby making music"" but the album is BORING and over the top with the sex songs. Don't waste you money on this!!!!IF YOU WANT TO HEAR SOME REAL R&B; GO GET RAHEEM DEVAUGHN'S THE LOVE EXPERIENCE. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!"
2,Not his best...,"I give him 2 stars just for Trapped in the closet and Sex in the Kitchen Remix.The album is not worthy, but buy the first single.His best album: Chocolate Factory. Happy people was good as well.His Remix album is due in December..."
1,Hip Hopera? More like the Jerry Springer show caught on cd.,"Anyone who says his trapped in the closet series is 'magnificent' and 'innovative' must be on crack. I actually watched one of the videos thinking that it was a parody of the song, because it was so stupid and ridiculous, but it was the real song! This goes to show how simple-minded people are and can truly find anything entertaining. The singing is terrible, the stories are terrible, the videos are terrible, and people love it! You, reading this right now, probably think these videos are the greatest thing since 'Gettin Jiggy Wit It'. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL."
4,DAMN THE CD ISNT THAT BAD,HE SWITCHED IT UP N IT WORKS REGGAETON IS HOT RIGHT NOW HE GOT A TRACK ON THERE THAT IS STRIAGHT THat CHEATING WIT UR GIRL IS HOT MESSED UP BUT TRUE IT HAPPENS SLOW WIND WIT A JAMIACA FEEL IS ALSO HOT HE DOIN ALL TYPES OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOODS REGGAE REGGAETON SLOW CUTZ THE ALBUM IS GOOD HE SWITCHED IT UP N ITS SOUND GOODCHI-TOWN BABY KANYE NEW ALBUM FENA BE HOT
3,TP3-RELOADED,"I enjoyed this CD as I do all of R.Kelly's Music. The man is very creative artistically (personal problems notwithstanding)Among the songs I like are Players only, Tshirt, all five trapped in the closet, Kicking it with your girlfriend, in the kitchen, Happy Summertime and Girls go Crazy. Lyrically I think [...]was much better but this one does not disappoint."
1,Big disappointment,"I remember how happy I was when I bought this cd several years ago...and how disappointed I'd been afterwards. This cd is just pure crap. I could have never expected something so commercial and bad-written from who I considered (and I know I'm not the only one) the king of r'n'b.Apparently double-up is just as bad as this one, so I've never bought any cd from Robert again.This is really a waste, the guy used to be so talented!"
2,R. Kelly is one horny dude...,"All i gotta say is R. Kelly is one really horny dude. Three descriptive words for this album: sex, sex, and sex. Don't get me wrong he has a nice voice, but his themes just get overplayed, Trapped in the Closet is good, but gets old real fast, and the first song Playa's Only with Game is good, I like Burn It Up alot, and the one he does with Twista and Do Or Die is good. But other than that this album is boring and repetitive...check my reviews on all Ja Rule albums except VVV,Rule 3:36, and Exodus (the three best ones lol), Fat Joe's Loyalty, and Mike Jones' albumJA RULE IN 2006!!!!!!!"
4,A Musical Genius,"This man truly is a musical genius in my mind, forget all the controversy thats old news and im tired of hearing about it, the bottom line is R Kelly makes that real feel good music with that little bit of an edge that keeps it interesting. Trapped In The Closet is amazing the way they all play into each other and the drama just makes you want to hear the next one. I cant wait to hear 6-10 it really catches your attention that much. Overall i'd actually give this 4 1/2 stars, a great album from Kels as usual and you wont be dissapointed with this one."
3,not bad....but way over hyped,"Lets all be honest here...the only reason any of us bought, or are thinking about buying this cd is because of trapped in the closet series. R. Kelly is a decent singer, but not great. he just knows what it taes to sell records. I love the trapped in the closet series and i cat wait to get th other chapters, but other than that, there were only about 4-5 other songs on this album that were good. Almost every single song sounded the same to me. From the production, to the lyrics, to the sound, there just wasnt enough variety to satisfy me. Every single song it seemed was about havin sex. havin sex fast, slow, in the kitchen, etc...C'mon R. Kels there is a lot more that you could be singing about than sex. Overall i give it 3 stars maybe 3 1/2 but he needs more variety on this record. If you want a cd about sex and only sex, then buy this cd. If you want a good, solid r n b cd dont waste your money."
5,Still the King of R&B...,"Ok, there are a lotta people judging what's going on in his personal and most of them probably haven't even listened to the cd yet. No matter what kind of music he makes he is always gonna have people hating on him. The sad thing is it's his own race trying to bring him down. Anyway, this album is not a 5, but it's far from a 0. I'd have to give it a 4. This isn't even his best effort, but it's still better than most of these r&b albums floating around the airwaves. No other r&b artist can do what he does. Whenever someone wants a hit single they always run to him. That says a lot!"
5,Reloaded,this is a good cd it features trapped in closet 5 parts / playas only the old r.kelly is back and better than chacolate factory.and simular to tp2 and 12 play .
1,"This may be the single most untalented ""artist"" I have ever heard.","I have watched Trapped in a Closet and I have read about what MTV and VH1 have said about it. They claim that this is the greatest urban opera since what Micheal Jackson did. Athough I have never actually watched what Micheal did, I know enough about it to know that Trapped in a closet does not compare to it. The next time you listen to Trapped in a closet, listen to the lyrics. They are so bad that it is funny. Literally. My 4 year old cousin could write better lyrics. I, a 13-yr old(didnt bother with filling out stuff)skinny white boy could write better lyrics, easily. Maybe the rest of this album is better, but I wouldn't know(I haven't heard it). If it is, then I'm sorry, but as for Trapped in a Closet, that is a disgrace to music."
4,R.Kelly Trapped in the closet,I thought the cd was good players only was a hot track and i liked the trapped in the closet parts 1-5
1,He should have stopped,"When he got caught molesting underaged kids. His drama and fake soulis tired and drawn out. If I want soul music, I'll listen to the real stuff and not manufactured garbage like R.Kelly.Seriousally.... It's like the guy is mocking today's mediocre R&B; and he doesn't even realize it. The joke is on him and modern day R%B stars."
3,Go on and do it!!!!!!!!!!!!,Somebody needs to hurry up and give R.Kelly a movie. It's so obvious that man wants to act so bad he can taste it! His songs alike Tp.2 are hilarious and are not to be taken offense to. Its comical in a DOLEMITE kind of way! Hence his video with him and some dang numb-chucks! Just enjoy the album and take it for what it is!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,In between,"I can't say that I love the album nor can I say I hate it. It seriously does have some classic R. Kelly tracks that stand out among the rest (kickin' it with your girlfriend being my favorite). However I don't care at all for the faster tracks or the whole trapped in the closet drama. Without the videos trapped in the closet is lacking alot. But he definitely makes up for this in the slower cuts like sex weed, and sex in the kitchen among others. But dang R. Kelly!!! does every song have to be about sex? Start makin them classics like ""I believe I can fly"" again."
5,Kelly is off the Chain,"This man is phenomenal. R Kelly has been impressing me since 12 Play. The man can write about real life dirty situations (Trapped in The closet).Then he can come at you with soul stirring songs like U Saved Me and the Storm is Over. The man is truly an artist. I don't care what these ignorant people say about him being just another artist, or not fitting in with Luther, Marvin Gaye, or Al Green. I think he ranks right up there with the best of them. This whole CD to me is Excellent. I think there are alot of people that situate Kel's personal life next to his music. Me, as well as every other so called critic out there, no nothing about his personal life so we can't judge. As far as his music and god given talent goes, the man is a genius. Keep em coming Kel's. You'll always get my 13 dollars."
1,WOW,"this is like the worst cd ever created. i don't care how good the other songs are, all i need to listen to is the trapped in the closet. WHAT THE HELL IS HE TALKING ABOUT. Its such a stupid series of song, but hes not stopping at that, he's coming out with 6-10. This is not bad for laughs though, its frickin hilarious."
2,Same Ol' Junk Since 1992,"R. Kelly is doing nothing we have already heard before. The sex on here is ridiculous and over the top. Nobody need to know what you do in bed just like we didnt need to see you having sex with that 14 year old girl. He's suppose to be this so called king but yet he doesnt impress and bring nothing new to the table but the same sex me this, sex me that songs which are very played out. Nobody sings about sex anymore the way they use to back in the days and what makes it worse is that the sex being talked about here is so embarrassing Oh my goodness like that song with Nieva is so dumb and retatred. R. Kelly is tired like the repetive subject matter and the album title."
4,about the album TP3 Reloaded............,"This album is made possible with the collaboration between Liang Wen Fu (Singapore swing songwriter - chinese) and me Ang Poon Kah with indication on the front of jewel box that is on left and right which indicates our names. I hope all would enjoy this exquisite album. Have a nice day enjoying. Singapore HMV and Gramophone sells this album currently.TP.3 ReloadedWritten by:Dr, MR Franc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon KahDirector Lou Ye - Ang Poon Kah for film summer palace."
4,NOT ONE OF MY MOST PLAYED R. KELLY ALBUMS...,"This project is all mixed up with various settings and/or grooves, and doesn't fall in the pocket as a Solid Album Project. Standout Tracks are: ""Slow Wind"", ""Kickin' It With Your Girlfriend"", And the Main Track that sold the album: ""Trapped In The Closet"". If you were lucky enough to get this Compact Disc when it was first released you got the Bonus DVD of ""Trapped In The Closet"" (And what a Video!!!). R. Kelly ALWAYS managed to get a Billboard #1 Hit Single, and a few Top Ten Singles to boot from EVERY Album...So far, but there's always room for improvement, and I'm pretty sure he will get better with the next project...He has too much talent to let it go to waste. Maybe he was rushing to get this release finished, there has to be a story behind this almost weak project."
3,Solid but not so...,"When I picked this album up back in August I decided I would make an attempt to like an R. Kelly record on my first listen.Not so, it took me about 2 1/2- 3 months to get the feel of it.There are about 3 or 4 tracks that could go missing on the album.Girls Go Crazy should be the main one because it is so annoying.However, it took some time for Slow Wind to grow on me.I'm not a major fan of reggae so it was obvious, but the album is solid once you take some time to listen to it."
3,Let him out of the closet already!,"Not so pleased with this CD. I love the Chocolate Factory and this falls WAY short of that! It's sex this and sex that. I thought the ""big R."" had left a bit of that behind but he comes back at it full tilt on this CD. It gets WAY too repetitive and annoying. There are a few good club bumpers on here. Not many good signature R.Kelly ballads (they all have to do with sex). Then you have the whole ""Trapped In The Closet"" saga!! UGH! A few are ok....but, 5?!?! My god! Then he is releasing 6 more?? Jeez! Me giving it 3 stars is being VERY generous.I do like the songs: ""Playas Only"" F/ The Game, ""Happy Summertime"" F/ Snoop, ""Slow Wind"" and ""Reggae Bump Bump"" F/ Elephant Man But that's the extent of it."
3,No his best work,The truth is the only reason I bought tis CD was because of the hype about the Trapped in the Closet mini saga. Those are the only songs I have listened to since buying the CD a month ago. This is not the R's best work at all. Would I buy it again? NOPE!
1,Um...,"...you are joking right? Does R Kelly know what a Thesaurus is? These are the most simplistic, juvenile lyrics I've ever heard. Sounds like someone fell asleep at the mixing board, woke up and hit 'save' on the Master copy! Do yourself a favor and buy ANYTHING else!"
3,He's still the king but he needs to act his age,"This cd has its promises and I just love the trapped in the closet series but, I expected more from the king of RnB. I own every one of R Kelly's CDs and I saw a gradually maturing Pied Piper. [...] was in my opinion his last sex craving cd. With Chocolate factory made for the steppers and the lovers, Happy People/U saved me is in my opinion his best CD. It shows his talents and it brought me closer to GOD. I beleive he is almost 40 and he needs to act his age. Leave to sex songs to Omarions and the youngans that know nothing about love and GOD and that is where you step in and make so of the most memorible love and gospel songs in the History of RnB. For you next cd please return to love and Gospel songs."
3,Im gonna keep it simple and plain...this album is not that good because,"1. The album starts out with a bang (""Playa's only"" and ""Happy Summertime"") then begins to drag on. You ask why? I'll tell you2. His three note philosophy (rain drop effect, and 2 bass cords) this is going on through song #'s 3-15. Repetitive, huh?3. You feel like throwing the cd out after hearing the same beat over and over and over and over again.This is not his best work, if you wanna hear R. at this best get ""R. Kelly"", Tp-2, Chocolate Factory, 12 play, and Happy people/U Saved Me."
4,"Kelly, You Go Boy!!!","Well, I must say this CD is pretty Hot!!! to me. I just love ""Sex in the Kitchen"", ""Touchin'"", ""Remote Control"", ""Slow Wind"" and ""Reggae Bump,Bump"" is going to be HOT on the Club Scence. However, ""Playa Only"" and ""Happy Summertime"" I don't care for at all. The ""Trapped in the Closet"" short movie really held my attention but once you see it...well then it over. And as for the other songs on the CD they are just alright to me nothing special at all. Now I am just sitting back and waiting for Chapter 6-10 of the movie to come out!!!!!! Really lking foward to seeing it."
5,very useful,"A wonderful investment of time and money. This book is easy to read, contains a great deal of information, gives good examples of ways to teach and ways to monitor outcomes. A must for anyone who works with residents."
3,decent poseur,"james chance is very very schticky. his pose as an ultra funky jazzbo with violent tendencies works sometimes. it works on about half of this. first off, his vocals and sax are VERY offputting: if you're not into a certain amount of shrill annoyance in your music, stop right here. his bands have never been the new JB's as he thinks they are. and his disgust and contempt for everything around him isn't very effectively put across. he comes off more often sounding like a very crabby 4 year old...uh..singing from heroin's point of view. all that said, this is okay but not a legendary lost recording by any means. to experience this fiend at his ""best"", check out the ""no new york"" album or ""live in new york""."
3,Check expiration date,"The cookies themselves are great. However, please please check the expiration dates on the cookies when you receive them. Mine were 6 weeks past the expiration date when I received them."
2,Ok for health food,"This cookies tastes ok for a healthy snack, but don't bother if you're looking for a good cookie in general. At 300-ish calories, this cookie is pretty caloric. However, you get a very good serving of fiber and protein along with it. I personally wouldn't buy this variety again. I way prefer the taste and texture of the double chocolate chunk variety from the same maker."
5,This was one of my favorite books,The book is about a dog named Seaman who traveles on across America trying to find a North West passage with Louis and Clark. It was set back in the early seventeenth centry. I think this book is very realistic. It had a very interesting ending that really surprised me. It is one of the best books I have ever read. I would recommend this book to dog lovers and fans of historical fiction books. I would recommend ages 9 and up to read this adventure filled book. I liked this book more than all the Harry Potter books combined.
4,My opinion,The Captains Dog is about this group of explorers that find Louis and Clark journey log and they followed the way that they went. The dog was the guide of Louis and Clark tribe.I liked this book because it was interesting to me.It was interesting to me because it was about great explorers.
5,great book to read,"I got this book to use it in a school. I so much enjoyed reading this, I could not put it down. Now, each day, a little of the book is being read to the children. They love it and look forward to hearing more about ""The Captain's Dog."""
4,Sword in your palm,"I've always liked swords so I just had to have this piece. It looks exactly like the picture. My only complaint is it bends a little too easily, it isn't straight. I never purposely bent it, it just bended over time. However, it can be bended back. Other than that, it's a great little piece."
1,Pass on it.,"Major negatives: The hose on this unit has the nasty habit of working loose from the wand no matter how hard you insert it. This happens unexpectedly and makes the unit tricky to use as the wand can fall out and hit you on the leg. And the cheap plastic hose material kinks easily. Also, after 9 months of light use, the motor is beginning to sound like it needs replacement. Minor negatives: there is space at the end of the handle but no way to stow any of the accessories in it. What were the engineers thinking? Pass on this thing."
5,"oh yes, one more tiny thing....","whatever happened with Hugh?? just a little loose end i was slightly disappointed not to find tied up....however, i definetly think she was better off with Morgead...power to the soul-mate principle!"
4,A good Read.,"From the beginning, the book was a great read but as I neared the middle and end, it seemed as if L.J. Smith didn't have a better way for the characters Jez and Morgead to overcome their being soulmates. Granted Jez had a tougher time coming to grips with their being soulmates which is to be expected but when it came to Morgead, he seemed to take it better then you would expect. L.J. Smith had Morgead's character give off a tough appearance and because of what happened in his past, when he realized that he and Jez were soulmates, he should have had a much harder time adjusting to something that would change the rest of his life.The book is a good read when you feel like reading something but the ending was unfortunately unsatisfying."
4,Very good book by a GREAT author!!,"I love all of LJ Smith's books, and I was very glad to see that this one followed in the footsteps of the other books in the Nightworld series. I, unlike some other people who have written reviews, think that the soulmate principle is an excellent and most crucial part of the book. In this book, I kept expecting Jez to find out that she was maybe 1/2 witch instead of human, which would make her situation more easy and which would create an interesting base for possible upcoming books with her character in it. But this book was great anyway. It was touching, with a great plot and plenty of twists, with that perfect ammount of romance added in. I hope LJ Smith keeps doing what she's doing, and I can't wait for the next book she writes. I'm hoping for a book where some of the characters from previous books are used, like James and Poppy, Ash, and Quinn in particular"
5,A really good book that anyone should read!!!,"This book was really great. The storyline was very interesting, the soulmate principle was in full form, and the characters were well described and understood. I also like this new thing about the apocalypse, and the four standing against it. I can't wait until they find the other three Wild Powers (I won't tell you who the Wild Power is in this book. It would ruin the surprise!) Jez, Morgead, and the rest of the characters were great, and I hope to see them popping up in some of the other books, as well as some of her previous characters (Ash, M'lin, Quinn, Rashel, Poppy, and Blaise in particular). I hope that L. J. Smith keeps doling it out! ~Sunn"
5,excellent read,"i found LJS characterisation in this book excellent. we are brought into a world by Jez that is so different from ours that we begin to start to believe it may be true. once jez is taken from her reality and is made to live in the 'human' world, we are brought through her struggles at becoming a human but are the same time trying to right the wrongs that she has done. the love story plot throughout the book makes the reader confused as Morgead is what Jez used to be and what she dislikes now, which makes the reader feel sympathy towards Morgead about, although also makes us mistrust and make us ask ourselves 'if he knew the truth about Jez, will he still love her?'the ending is unexpected, making the reading even more worth while an excellent read, the best out of the Night World Series"
5,This book is wonderful.....,"It's the best NightWorld one yet. This book had more action then the others, and it wasn't so involved with the ""soulmate"" theme. Ignore the summary on the back, it's kind of misleading. I enjoyed the apocalyptic context, very interesting"
5,My review of Huntress,"L.J. Smith's book ""Huntress"" was one of her best. Jess Redfern is a vampire who hunts humans; until she discovers she's half human. Then she begins to kill vampires to protect humans. There's lots of action and romance. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys horror, because LJ. Smith is the master of horror/romance novels. I can't wait for Strange Fate to hit the bookstores. I've read all of the Nightworld series and I've been waiting for the conclusion of the series for years now. Does anyone out there know when this book is coming out?"
5,Awsome Book!,"I LOVE THIS BOOK! I ESPECIALY LIKED MORGEAD BUT TO ME THE NAME SEEMS A LITTLE GEEKY FOR HIM. I ALSO LIKED PEIRCE UNTIL HE HIT MORGEAD OVER THE HEAD. THIS BOOK DESERVES 7 STARS!

5,The best L.J. Smith book ever!,Secret Vampire used to be my favorite book until I read this book. I read this book four times and it gets better every time. I love the soulmate idea and the wild power thing is even better than that. The characters are great. The whole book is great.
5,"The most romantic, heart-wrenching book yet....","This book is the best yet in the Night World series...and the most romantic. Jez was by far the strongest and bravest heroine ever. I admired her strength and courage. Morgead was also surprising, he was the last character I expected to bend to the soulmate principal. The all time best part was at the end... the ending just proved how strong the soulmate wire is, and how strong a love for one person can possibly be. Once, again this was the best book ever, and I hope to see more like it in the future."
5,This book is a gift for all seasons.,From May Sarton's Well is beyond doubt one of my most favorite books. I keep it on my coffee table at all times and I have given it as a gift many times over. It is always gratefully received and treasured. One can look at the photos and read the words over and over and always find something new in them. Thank you Ms Schade.
4,Wonderful photos of each state!,"The photos are wonderful, though, personally, I prefer more photos of landscapes. It's a wonderful book on America states!"
3,Cautionary: Weighted heavily in favor of poetry!,"I bought the book and have read 1/3 of it. While the author is unquestionably qualified and writes well, I do have a beef: Many, perhaps most of the examples cited in the first third of the book relate to poetry. This is a personal disappointment, because I translate prose and frankly find it hard to relate to the technical issues he focuses on, e.g., rhyme, meter, etc. As long as you are aware of this, the book is a good read and arguably of interest to those who dabble in literary translation, as well as professionals."
5,AWESOME DISC,I first heard this playing in a local music. I was immediately sold. The sound and lyrics are all genius! I LOVE it!
4,Corvette's and more Corvette's,"This tape is a good look at individual Corvette's from 1953 - 1989. The first Corvette made it's debuted on June 30, 1953 for only $3,500, this tape has the first black & white commercial advert on this car.The tape is only 30 minutes long, which I thought was a bit short, but it is worth having in your collection. It gives buyers a good look through each model specifications, and what has been added to each car through this period.Sit back and have a look through the best car ever made.... CORVETTE."
4,Compelling but heartbreaking.,"Powerfully spun tale, both compelling and unflinching in its portrayal of 'scapegoating.' The tale builds around the cruel abuse and treatment of Mokie, a young girl abandoned at birth. While beautifully written, each chapter compounds the injustices served on this likeable protagonist. The reader never enjoys a sense of equality for Mokie -- justice is never served -- hardships are not incurred for those who make her life so miserable. Tightly written with intriguing characterizations in an original voice, this novel is hard to put down, and even harder to forget. Vivid and graphically described assaults make this a book unsuitable for sensitive readers."
3,"Gripping, but very dark","I have to agree that this book is not for sensitive readers. It is gripping, with good characterization. I agree with the reviewer who said that Fleiger sometimes tells rather than shows us. I had trouble putting the book down, but it left me feeling down."
2,"Introduces ""I don't want to go to sleep""","My 27 month old toddler is very interested in ""first reader"" stories, so I was looking for a bedtime one. This story is about a little kitten that doesn't want to go to bed. My toddler is verbal and remembers the ""I don't want to go to sleep"" responses of the kitten to his parents. I prefer to have a book that models a desired bedtime routine rather than one of the child resisting and the parents repeatedly insisting that it's time to go to bed. My daughter favors dogs over cats, so the Biscuit series is very popular with her, and I like how they are written and illustrated."
1,This Must BE a virus!!! Its definately trash!!!,"Unfortunately I didn't read these reviews until it was too late. I bought from CompUSA and installed on my ME machine. Subsequently problem after problem developed until I couldn't even get a clean boot. It somehow trashed some utilities I had on my system which are now completely missing. I finally was able to disable most everything during a boot sequence and uninstall. Thank God. This software is garbage and certainly not compatible with ME. I still can't access the internet through IE, which now occasionally blows the entire screen off. I returned it and I bought Norton at a recommendation from a friend. Other people I have talked to since have had similar problems with this software and had to use rescue disks just to get their machines to boot. I hight recommend AGAINST anyone buying this product."
1,"bad software, bad custom service","Bought one from CompUSA and installed it. Really feel bad, the uninstaller (v6.02) integrated in it doesn't work at all. After several times of installation and uninstall, I gave up. The custom service is ridiculous. There's a phone number, but it's not a 800 number so I have to make a long distance call. After several entries I was told I should call another number (long distance call to me again). This time I was told their office hour was before 4:30pm. So I have to use their 'smart' internet custom service, sent emails and wait. No response yet for almost a day by now.Fortunately I returned it to CompUSA and got a refund. A person worked there also thought this software was really bad and recommand me to buy a Norton. At least I won't buy any other product from McAfee."
1,"Windows ME and McAfee Office 3.1 NOWAY, ME & 3.5 OK","Bought McAfee Office 3.1 to run on a Windows ME computer. Initial installation is when the nightmares began. Could not uninstall all the McAfee Office 3.1 components either. Not about to spend ADDITIONAL $$$ on Toll Calls, used the McAfee Chat over internet. After a few weeks of deadends and frustration, Demanded to chat with a supervisor. McAfee then sent a new McAfee Office package. Guess what ??? What came in the mail was not version 3.1 but version 3.5 This new 3.5 had a totally different set up screen. Version 3.5 loaded without any problems and ""so far"" runs just fine even after 3.1 about messed up the computer. McAfee has real problems with anything less than version 3.5 and Windows ME. If your users manual says Version 3.1, don't wait -- Make them send you a new package with version 3.5 (or higher if they have it).Beware of new purchase, current ""advertised"" versions all say version 3.0"
2,A big no-go on my system,"After installing the suite my computer has been seriously misbehaving and freezing. Like other users, uninstalling seems to be the impossible order of the day. I finally had to reformat. I took a chance and reinstalled but this time only one application at a time. After each application I would reboot and then do the next. That seems to have done it. I'm not convinced yet, even after the reinstall, that the suite works that well."
5,"MCAFEE HITS THE BALL OUT OF THE PARK AGAIN, GRAND SLAM","I HAVE SEEN THIS PRODUCT RUN. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET IT ON MY SYSTEM. I RUN A HP PAVILION 8750C PIII WITH WINDOWS ME AND MICROSOFT OFFICE 2000 PREMIUM. I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN MCAFEE. THEY HAVE ALWAYS STOOD BY THEIR FINE PRODUCTS. MY WIFE RUNS NORTON PRODUCTS AND I DON'T LIKE TO KNOCK ANOTHER PRODUCT BUT, I ENJOY USING MY COMPUTER ON FRIDAY NIGHTS AND NOT BEING TIED DOWN TO AN UPDATE. MCAFEE RUNS WHEN YOU WANT IT AND AT ANY TIME OF THE DAY OR NIGHT. THREE CHEERS FOR MCAFEE THEY MAKE ME PROUD TO BE ONE OF THEIR MANY CUSTOMERS. THANK YOU GOD BLESS AND KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK"
4,I loved it!,"I actually started with this book first out of the series due to my interest in the Phoenix clan. I had read about the Phoenix clan in the Rokugan roleplaying books.Since I did not read any of the other books in the series, I base my review ONLY on this book.I really enjoyed this book alot. The character Kaede, Mistress of the Void, was defenitely my favorite in the book. She was torn between her own self-preservation, her clan & the Empire.One of the best book I have read in awhile. I am looking forward to the rest of the Clan books."
2,What Happened?,"I've read the entire series so far from Scorpion, Unicorn, and Crane. This is the weakest and worst. There are too many characters from the Phoenix clan. Everything seems disjointed. It needed to concentrate on one or two characters. Instead there the at least 7 phoenix characters with not enough done to flesh them out. I'm not sure but this will probably be the last book of the series, because WOTC is ending the 5 rings product line."
1,Lightweight legs,"Not as good as the sturdy units I ah purchased from BB & B, whcih has sold looking frame instaed of this one with ""thinnish"" legs. Should have stuck to the BB & B model"
2,"Straps not the same length and color is more brown than ""espresso""","Two problems with this luggage rack. First, the straps are not the same length, so some are slack when it is fully opened. Second, the color is not ""espresso"" - it is a medium brown. Espresso should be a very dark brown, almost black. This is a medium brown.It is very lightweight and seems pretty cheaply made.It works, but I dont think this is a very high quality item."
1,A substandard product,"The rack was well-packed and arrived on time. Unlike the website picture, it was cheaply made with poor finishing. There were several rough and uneven spots. The straps were flimsy thin strips attached to the wood with a single staple. It also had an unsteady appearance. May be able to hold a small hand-luggage bag. Certaintly won't hold an average size suitcase. I have already returned it. Please do not waste your time or money on it."
4,luggage rack,"Perfect for my new guest bedroom makeover. Hard to find in local stores, but Amazon had a nice selection.Winsome Wood Luggage Rack, Espresso"
4,Functional rack at a good price,"I gave this rack to a friend as a house gift for a new apartment. I told her to look it over carefully since other reviews indicate damage. It was good looking, and worked fine.. no problems"
4,"Works great, looks fine","Nothing fancy about it but so far (couple of months), its been fine. We don't use it very heavily but for those who use it for the occasional packing for a trip or guest room use or even to sit a laundry basket on when you're putting the clean stuff back in the drawers, you'll get your money's worth."
4,Luggage rack,I thought this was a very good luggage rack for the money. It should work just fine foroccasional company.
2,"6"" crack, poor finish","One leg is cracked (through a doweled area) probably from no protection other than cardboard shipping box. The finish, while a nice dark color, is uneven due to poor prep of wood. Some areas are shiny, others have a rough texture. I may glue and refinish the crack or just send it back. I am too busy prepping for 35 arriving for Christmas!I have been an Amazon shopper for over 6yrs.; recently placed about 16 orders! This is the first item that was unsatisfactory.Update: This item was returned. I bought a small folding table instead."
2,"arrived in three pieces, not one","I ordered this despite reading the reviews that said it was of low quality because I needed something quickly. That is also why I am not returning it, and am hoping that the glue job needed immediately will be effective. A large piece surrounding the screw on one leg was broken off upon arrival. Good be poor product, could be inadequate protection during shipping but was probably both - for a product of this quality, you need alot more protection during shipping."
3,Design could be improved...,The straps are spaced too far apart so that small or medium pieces of luggage or supported only by the interior two straps. I would have preferred a slightly narrower spacing. Overall acceptable but not outstanding.
2,Not so great,"It held the suitcase nicely and has a nice appearance. The fault being that it doesn't stay closed when you are not using it. It would need Velcro stapes or something. If you are keeping it up all the time, it is at a good price point."
3,As advertised,Meets the basic requirements that I was looking for. Shipment was quick and arrived on time. Appears to be a good product.
2,"Works, but NOT as good as new","Easy enough to install but the battery is nothing like the original one. Even after I had my 5G for 3 years, the original battery held a much longer charge than this does. This one is often down to 1/2 after a few hours use. Many times it has gone from 1/2 to dead just by sitting unused for a couple days. If you can find another battery option, go for it. This one works but I find myself having to recharge it far more often than with the original battery."
4,Available as CD too if you know where to look,"OK, as part of the ever burgeoning series of Goon Shows made available by BBC Radio this here is volume 17. You can get it as a double cassette with one half hour show per side or as a double CD version with two shows slotted onto each disc.The episodes featured here are The Reason Why - not one of their finest moments IMHO; The Treasure in the Tower - ditto IMHO; The Plasticine Man - a great episode with all sorts of cultural throwback comedic moments and very much a Britsh style of humour and finally The Silent Bugler - another great episode full of spoofs of the spy trade and a number of nicely realised comedic moments.For The Plasticine Man and The Silent Bugler this is a good buy for fans of this 50's/60's franchise of British radio comedy. General comedy fans should approach with caution unless your pretty sure of what you are getting."
4,Lost Your Swing & No Pro To Help Find It?,"This book will help you find it, uncomplicate it and play better the next round.He goes step by step through the grip, setup and swing, with great photos from all angles.Useful drills as well, especially the one about finding your tempo by gripping the clubhead and taking some swings this way."
5,Excellent Book,"This instruction book is absolutely fantastic. Easy to follow for beginners and packs enough info and drills for seasoned instructors like myself. Lots of pictures, nice section on rhythm looking at Sam Snead swing sequence, and multi angle swing sequence of Tom's swing at the end of the book was very appreciated. Easy to understand verbage coupled with drawings make this very user friendly. Should have picked this up years ago...that good. At the very least just pick it up because its Tom Watson, still going strong into his late 50's, must know something. Highly recommend for all golfers and instructors."
5,fun to read,"This is one of my favorite books for my toddler, we read it more when she was littler, between a year and two years. The rhymes are fun without being too boring for adults, the illustrations are gorgeous, funny, and clever. A great book for kids and parents."
5,Read to me readily!,"Originally picked this up at the library. The illustrations are soft and tender and whimsical at the same time. The rhythm of the text when read aloud is joyful and soothing. The book is divided into three sections, which I find unnecessary and a little choppy in flow, but a great book for bedtime or quiet time nonetheless."
4,Addictive reading for the young set,"I find the language annoying but the pictures are charming and keep my interest for the thousands of times I have read this. My almost-2-year-old daughter loves it so much that I'm buying it because I can no longer keep checking it out from the library. Even though I know it by heart, she still needs to know that the actual book is there."
2,Aimed at the American nostalgia market,"This book bears little relation to the TV series, being more the author's personal travelogue than a useful survey of the archeaology. It is probably better aimed at the American nostalgia market, rather than anyone with a genuine interest in Ireland, historical or modern. A small book - the size, but not the thickness, of a paperback - with few pictures, I felt it was poor value for money. I would, however, strongly recommend the 3-part TV series which it accompanied, which successfully combined academic rigour with stunning visuals, and delightful vignettes of modern throwbacks to more ancient ways of life (DVD Region 1 only, alas)."
2,"Keeps the ""famine"" lie alive.","In Search of Ancient Ireland compiles in a popular way what has been promoted for the past half-century. This includes its description of the 1845-1850 Irish Holocaust (or genocide, or extermination) as ""famine."" One of McCaffrey's spokespersons recently responded to my objection to her perpetuation of ""famine"" regarding Ireland by accusing me of not having read her books. But in this book she refers to it exclusively (and falsely) as ""famine,"" and does so three times (on page 52); therefore it can hardly be said that she is a dependable historian even if she eschews the ""famine"" falsehood in her other books and contradicts in them what she wrote in this one."
2,Needs editing!,"I was disappointed in this book. It fails for two reasons.First it has been downloaded without any subsequent editing. For example words beginning with ""R"" are written as ""B""s - so we are told of the Boman (Roman) Empire, Dalraiba (Dalriada), Bussia (Russia), baided (raided). The Book of Kells is frequently referred to as the Book of Kelts. Words are frequently hyphenated for no good reason. Spelling of the same Irish names are spelled many different ways - some very obviously wrong.Second the book is meant as a companion to the PBS television program and does not work well as a stand alone.This could easily been a much better book."
3,Just Like Watching TV,This book was based on a TV series and I felt just like I was watching it on the Discovery or History channel. It was very easy to read. I missed the trappings of scholarship found in most history books. I would recommend to those who are interested in early history and have little or no college education.
3,For the Completist Only,"Their first full-length release back in '83 or something. Includes vastly inferior and uncompelling versions of Drzhava and Panorama (with a totally pointless, unimpressive high pitched electronic tone in place of the later version's east and west speech), but if you can't get the brilliant 'Rekapitulation 1980-84' CD put out by Walter Ulbricht Schallfolien then get this for the evocative and lesser-known cuts like 'My Brother' (Brat Moj) and 'We are Creating the Future' (Mi Kujemo Bodochnost). I have it (because I'm a completist), but don't listen to it that often."
5,Nice kit,"I've already had to use this kit on my car. I had a cheaper kit before, and the handles seemed flimsy. This one is very sturdy making it easy to push the plug in. If you need a tire plug kit for your road kit, this one is good."
3,The package does not seem to be new,"The suffs can hardly be said well-kept in seller's storage. Once the mail package was open, the plastic part of the pack had already be detached from the back. Luckily, it can be used whereas the first look of this package was reminding me that it may not be brand new."
1,Cheaper at WalMart,Good way to repair the average flat BUT. This same kit is available at you local WalMart for $3.00. Next time I will check WallyWorld 1st.update: This item is no longer available at Walmart. It has been replaced with the more expensive 11 piece kit for $5.97.The 8 piece kit I reviewed was sold for $3.00.
1,This Product is Pointless,"The instructions make it seem easy, but in practice it is very difficult to use, and I wasn't able to get the plug into the tire at all. The soft plug just sort of deformed around the hole in the tire and wouldn't go in. I don't see how it is possible to follow the instructions and have this thing work. It's worthless."
3,why use it?,"what bother me in the Product Description ""Designed for emergency tire repairs "" ""Enables you to get to a service center safely ""to do what? buy a new tire! if this thing can fix the tire why do I need to go to the service?if not then I'd rather use the the spare tire till I get to the service center and fix it."
4,The seed of some essential guides to Appalachian waterfalls,"This is not a great book in and of itself, but it is Morrison's first entry into what have become some great waterfall guides. This book took a large area and tried to tell a lot about it. His later waterfall guides basically superseded this book, and limit themselves in geographic area. ""Waterfall Walks and Drives in the Great Smoky Mountains and the Western Carolinas"" and ""Waterfall Walks and Drives in Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee"" are the two latest versions of his guides, and both are excellent. ..."
1,"Way to go, Razor and tie, another exploitative album","Razor and tie lines their piggy pockets again with this ""gem."" Exploiting artists and undermining their efforts as usual. No limits for these guys. It doesn't matter that they are robbing children of a chance to listen to good music or an opportunity to choose what they want, nor does it matter that they rob parents of $18, (plus s&H;, of course) and sanity; as long as they make a quick buck. Way to go, sycophants.Just get the originals, they sound better, ARE better, and you don't have to deal with these sleazeball slick slicksters ""Razor and tie,"" nor the headaches associated with the sounds of starving tone deaf children wailing to faux-music."
5,Dog-Opoly game,"I bought Dog-Opoly for my niece for Christmas. She loves it and so does the whole family. We played it for hours. Great game for the whole family.If you love dogs, you will love this game, each game piece had facts about dogs. For hours of fun buy Dog-Opoly."
5,Good Stuff and Great Fun,"I have not played the Dog Monopoly only this product Dogopoly, and I enjoyed it. My sister plays it with all her friends and they play it a lot surprisingly. It has the same features as Monopoly except instead of property it's dogs. I think the dogs make it more fun. Also my sister will trade me a good property for a lousy one just because she likes the dog better. Some how she still wins. I enjoy the playing pieces, they are good quality. This game is some what hard to find, and Amazon is the cheapest place I know to find it."
1,Wow More monopoly!,"Just what the world needs, another clone of the worst board game ever to sell like hotcakes.I can not think of any reason to recommend this game. The winner is determined by luck, there is no skill involved in winning this or any game of monopoly. The game hardly fits into a single evening of play, and for a few unlucky players who exit early that means either sitting around watching or finding something else to do (This may be a blessing if it means not playing anymore).So to anyone who is buying this to play it (not because you are a huge dog fan and must own everything that has a dog on it) I recommend that you look into a better product.I would start by going to Google and searching on ""board game"". Follow the 1st link you find."
5,it's the best book of internal medicine i've ever read,"""Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine"" is the best book about internal medicine I've ever read - not only in English. I use it often for checking several problems not only in clinical but also scientifical work. M.K. MD"
4,A good review with a better reference,"Harrison's handbook gives a good review of it's main textbook.Advanced treatment sections with dose calculations were missing details in older reviews.Usually ""firstER aid"" in emergent situations like visits & exams with experts...Gives nearly a full picture to topics.But I think,these kind of medium sized reviews do NOT need so detailed statistics etc.Most important point to notice must be that:""shortest detail,fastest format & guaranteed reference"".Still lab. references are poor,many survival mistakes on edition...I hope we can trust more to next edition & find a pocket so large to carry them.it must be thinner & larger to be called ""pocket size""...Worth of time and money..."
5,If your a Third year Medical student this book is a must.,"I just finished my third year of medical school, and I found this book to be a must own. the topics quite interesting and comprehensible, and will help with most areas you need to reference."
5,great reference,"Great reference resource. Can also be used as a doorstop, wheel chock, and can stop a .357 round at close range. I will buy this one again."
4,"Heavy going, but a great reference text","When any medical student is studying, they usually end up with a copy of this book.It's BIG - over 1200 pages of the tiniest possible readable writing, and covers vitually every disease in clincal medicine.You'll find yourself referring to this one a lot, as it's the de facto medical bible, it's a wonderful reference text.However, I'm not sure you'll want to learn from it directly, as the writing is disjointed from chapter to chapter (it was written by many authors), and it just doesn't ""read"" well. I certainly find an entire chapter at a time too much to bear in one sitting.That said, you'll still want this book - the breadth of chapters is amazing, and it's hard to argue with its authority!"
5,THE textbook of internal medicine,"I think harrison's should be the reference book for all the undergraduate students in the world. it is concise, yet awfully complete. it's my bible in my study"
4,Funny,"These guys are hilarious! If you get a chance check them out down in Key West. They perform their comedy songs every night between 5:30p and 9p. If your not going down there anytime soon, check them out on their website between the same times. They stream the video feed of them at the bar where they perform LIVE!They are really funny."
5,It's a Beauty!,"This is an album of great beauty. The songs have a simplicity and purity that is rare these days in pop and rock. It's like the classic naive teen pop soundtrack for sharing a strawberry shake, with that someone special to (with 2 straws), only done on synths instead of by a Doo Wop vocal group. Rev's singing style is unsophisticated and disarming, while the use of synths and general ethos brings to mind Brian Wilson's masterpiece of primitive pop The Beach Boys Love You. Rev's group Suicide always had romance aswell as darkness in their best work. There isn't much darkness here but there is a lot of romance. Pop music doesn't come much purer or more perfect than I Heard Your Name, it would be worth the price of admission for this track alone."
4,Plastic chain,"Correctly sized for landscape decorative work, this chain looks sharp and is simple to work with."
5,From Dinosaur to Dynamo via Word 2000 MOUS Study Guide,"I am a 70 year old lawyer who was a Dinosaur in Computerland. Before using this text I believed that the telephone was a miracle! The MOUS exam was more terrifying to me than taking the LSAT. After coming across Word 2000 MOUS Study Guide, I was able to answer the ""complicated"" questions raised by my computer-smart secretary. This book saved me both time and money, and earned me some respect!"
4,An uneasy tense emotional ride,"One of the best albums I own, from one of the most inspiring bands I've ever heard. This album slowly pulls one mood out from under you and replaces it with another. It slides from melancholy trance, to over whelming intensity then back again seamlessly. It runs the gamut of musical emotions. Most of the album inspires a mood very different from their live shows, but no one could ever put a Crashworship show on a CD, and the mood they produce on this album is sublime in its own right."
1,"Garmin-Transducer, Sort-of. . . but not really, be cautious!","This item is advertised as a Garmin Transducer at a very attractive price. The invoice even lists it as Garmin. The only trouble is, it's not really a Garmin product. No where on the enclosed instructions or litterature is the name ""Garmin"" mentioned of course And it doesn't work with my Garmin chart-plotter. Now since the boat has to be hauled to install or reinstall this device I'm certainly not going to the expense of a second haul-out this year just to retrieve this junk product. Just be warned when dealing with affiliates. I've had nothing but good experiences when buying products direct, but often dissapointed when redirected to an affiliate."
3,Just an ok DVD,"Come on, we're talking about Edgar Winter, the man behind ""They Only Come Out At Night"" and ""White Trash""; the man that, at a particular time, played with two of the most expressive guitarrists of the rock canon, his own brother, Johnny Winter, and the monster Rick Derringer... How can I fire 5 stars to this DVD when I see an ordinary guitarrist playing (and ruinning) ""Frankenstein"" and ""Free ride""... sad... the best instrumentist in this session, besides Edgar, of course, was the bass player... but that is not a plus, since the performances and renditions of fantastic songs is in just an average level... the show is 2 stars at the max... The sound and image of the DVD is fantastic, however, hence, an extra star. You deserve better sidemen, Edgar...."
5,Excellent movie............very accurate and compelling.,"This video very closely folows Jane Schwartz's book, Ruffian, Burning from the Start. The characters are perfect for their roles, the story is very well-developed, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Anyone who has read about this beautiful horse will be moved to tears at the end. After reading the book, the visual images enhanced my understanding of the horse, the trainer, and the untimely death of a magnificant animal. I would highly recommend it to anyone............as I would highly recommend reading the book.........first!"
1,This Movie Does No Justice for Ruffian!,"This movie is lame and doesn't do justice for her. Ruffian was an exquisite, wonderful being. I watched her race... it was amazing. I watched the match race... it was horrendous. Why make us relive it? The last 30 minutes of the movie was just as horrible as it was watching it real time.The best part of the movie was the ending credits where it actually showed Ruffian. (I only saw the movie when it aired on tv.) Maybe the additional clips on the DVD are worth it; not sure. I recommend instead purchasing the book ""Ruffian"" by Edward Claflin."
1,I saw her last race live.,"I witnessed the breakdown and there's nothing in this world that would make me want to relive that horrific moment. That was the last Thoroughbred race I ever watched.As long as owners continue to race horses as 2 year olds we will continue to see these 'breakdowns'. Horses are not ready to run that young. I suppose this movie is just another way to make money, exploiting Ruffian yet again."
4,horse movie,i enjoyed it and will watch it again even with the sad ending .good movie for people who love horses
3,Good for Most,This pan worked alright for me. I was expecting it to be a little deeper. Arrived quickly.
1,NC Baker,"The Platinum collection of Nordic is lightweight and inferior to their older pound cake pan, its light weight and the platinum spray is bubbled. So much so that the Amazon shipper should have noticed, but I haven't gone through the hassle and expense of of returning it yet! Buyer beware!"
3,"Cake rose and browned nicely, but getting it out of the pan was another story.","I bought this pan to start making angel food cakes, but decided to try making a sunshine cake in it first (a few less eggs wasted in case of a disaster). The cake rose and browned very evenly, and it was the perfect texture. I inverted the pan when cooling the cake as the recipe directed. Unfortunately, I did not have the same experience of the cake ""almost falling out of the pan"". The cake did not want to want to budge. I had a very, very difficult time removing the cake and it was not very pretty to look at in the end. Next time, I guess I will have to try parchment paper at the bottom of the pan."
5,Good pan,Glad to get this pan. My old one was in two pieces and it would leak batter in my oven and then I had a mess and had to always clean the oven after baking.
5,bakewear,Love Calphalon cookware and was glad to see a pound cake pan and a decent price. I got this for my husbands birthday and he loves it.
2,"disappointed with ""angel""","I was so excited to receive this pan, but find that it bakes the cakes too brown when following standard instructions on cake mix box. And the cakes are always very dark on the top, and although the cake doesn't stick to the pan, it really makes the pan hard to clean. Need to bake at a lower temp. on the top oven rack, if your able to."
2,Thank goodness for frosting...,"The first time I used this pan, I was baking a black and white angel food cake for a dinner party last winter. The pan cooked evenly and the cake tasted wonderful. However, the cake stuck to the pan terribly. You can slide a knife around the sides and the tube, but you can't do that along the bottom of the pan. I spent an hour trying to get the cake out of the pan, and when it finally came out, it sure wasn't pretty. Frosting saved the day, because after twelve straight hours in the kitchen, I certainly didn't have time to start over.I've tried it a few more times since, spraying the pan with non-stick spray, baking shorter, baking longer... nothing helps. The pan sticks, and since it is all one piece, there's no hope of the cake just sliding out.Do yourself a favor - skip this one, and buy a regular two-piece pan."
4,Great seat cover for the price,"I have been looking for an inexpensive, good looking seat cover and finally settled on this one. Please note that the package includes 2 covers and it will not work for seats that have the seat belt attached to the seat. I bought it for my civic and am very happy."
3,Good Product For The Price,"I purchased these seat covers for my Ford Escape. I have leather seats, which don't agree with me in the summer.The pros:1. The price is right.2. Blends in nicely with the interior of the car.3. Keeps me from sweating due to the leather seats.The cons:1. The fit is a bit loose. Even after tucking in the edges as much as possible, I still tend to slide around a bit, especially when getting into and out of the seat.2. It covers the entire back of the seat, so the storage pocket on the seat is inaccessible.3. The material is a bit scratchy and uncomfortable.4. The recommended laundering process is to hand-wash. (Too high maintenance for me!)Overall, this product is delivering on the intended purpose of my purchasing it. However, I think I should have taken more time to look around and find something I would like more."
4,These seat covers fit my seats so I'm happy with them,I wanted some inexpensive seat covers and picked these. So far they do the job as intended. Time will tell how they wear and how long they last. As of now I'm satisfied with this purchase.Auto Expressions 5040620 Braxton Grey Bucket Seat Cover
3,Didn't fit,Universal fit is inaccurate. Not sure what this cover would cover. At least return process was as good as always.
5,Good buy,"I bought these for my Jeep Liberty because I don't like the manufacturer material that comes in the Jeep. They fit perfect and look really nice, a great price!"
5,Impressed. Not cheap looking.,Bought for my 2012 Honda Civic EX with light grey interior. Installed in less than 10 minutes. I only wish they had a matching set for the back bench seats.
4,Grey Bucket Seat Cover,"These seat covers fit the 2010 Honda Civic very well. I had no problems putting them on, and the fit is snug. Looks nice with the grey interior of my car. The price was great, so they only thing I'm hoping is that they hold up well."
4,Review of Carter Family Favorites Cookbook,"This book was interesting and had wonderful recipes. There were many old south recipes, for example; Collard Greens or Cornbread. There are recipes in this book that cannot be found in other cookbooks. I highly recommend this book for it's high quality recipes."
4,Great Southern Style Recipes,"I don't have an opinion on the Carters, but this book has some great recipes. Apple-Peanut Cake, Brown Sugar-Banana pound cake, Soufflé Grand Marnier. MMM....I'm looking forward to making all the great recipes in this book."
1,if youve already seen it dont read this review.,"Ok the only reason im writing this review is because I saw the other 5 stars and thought, gee, must be good. Well this isn't a review more than my opinion. Couldn't even finish it. Every episode was soooo boring, I had to force myself to watch it, after all, spent money on it. But no, no no, not one single element interested me, boring characters Long winded dialogue about carbon credits and economical fail. Some people will Problibly love this and thats great. I hated what I saw to the point if there being no reason at all for me to even continue truging through more painful watching. What point us there after all when one finds absolutly no entertainment in the first 6 episodes. Thats a fail in my notebook."
4,paperback,"wow another gripping economics textbook!!!!I keep this one on my coffee table, displaying it proudly in my home.the chapters dont match the ones in the case fair hardcover principles of economics."
2,Over this dub,"This album wears thin after two listenings. While Mikey is talented, he muddles through on this one. I enjoyed his work with the Clash and recommend World War 3 instead."
4,Libretto please.,"This is a moving performance, although the superlatives that have been cited for Janet Baker are excessive. I cannot fathom any offering of an opera which is not among the twenty most popular that lacks a libretto, even if only in the language in which it is sung."
5,A Practical Formulary,"Boothe's Small Animal Formulary is a great addition to my practice. We refer to it several times a day. The format is easy to follow. What is especially useful is the ""Indications"" column. There is an ""Alphabetical List of Drugs by Propriety Name"" which helps to identify the generic names of the more common human medications. There are conversion and therapeutic drug monitoring data charts and a number of appendices. All of this info is packed into a convenient spiral-bound book that is small enough to be carried in a labcoat pocket! I highly recommend this book for all small animal practices."
2,Disappointing |Sojourn,I opened the book with high expectations...What a terrific title...and what a shame to find such immature writing. I kept waiting for the moment when I could share the author's experience...when I could admire her...or sympathize with her..but honestly...a pet fly! A captivating topic...wasted!
2,Hmmmm. A Parking Lot Puddle?,"I seem to be in the minority but I found this book particularly annoying. I found Ms. Holmes-Binney's ""discoveries"" rather shallow. While reading the book, I kept looking for a gem or two and found only fool's gold. I would have to say to Ms. Holmes-Binney ""You, my Dear, ain't no Joan Anderson!"""
4,Well written personal adventure,"A great story of personal examination, both of the author's past & current lives. The first third of the book grips & holds you firmly as you follow her adventures and struggle to survive. I couldn't put it down! (Stayed up way too late to finish the book!) The stories of her family and childhood were reflective and loving, but the narratives of her day to day existence and survival will fascinate any reader. I intend to give this as a gift to several people I know. I recommend it to just about everyone."
2,Not happy,About 10 pages were missing right before the last page. Really disappointed to get that far in the book and this happens
5,Wonderful Read,"Debi did what few people are willing to do. She told it like it was. She didn't try to make herself appear any other than real, with all that entails. Of course she made mistakes, darlings, that is how we learn. That was what she went into the desert for, to learn, not to get it perfect. And what did she learn? That she was strong, resilient, that despite her sometimes overwhelming fear, she could face it and overcome it. She learned that it was okay to be Debi whatever that might mean. That she didn't have to be any one of the images she'd been trying to fulfill, she could seek her own truth in the silence of her own being. Wonderful !"
5,"A griping, insightful and humorous book","This is a terrific book. Debi Holmes-Binney writes beautifully and with great humor of her sojourn to the desert. The book hooks you from page one and is a griping account of her couragous forty day adventure. I found the lessons that she learned and shares in the book to be insightful, sincere and meaningful. I highly recommend this book to men and women, it is fascinating to see how she responds to 40 days of solitude. This book will appeal to adventurers and cowards alike."
4,Great Adventure for women,"THis book shows a lot of spirit by Debi, camping out in the Great SAlt Lake Desert with only a tent! Some humorous parts about mice and her pet fly! Kept my interest, was hoping for a more 'spiritual' ending, but glad I read it!"
5,A Family Friendly Film,"Very funny, Hillarious, Cuba Gooding Jr. makes this film a bonus must have buy it today kind of feeling. It also made me want to go back to camp too. If your a fan of Family Friendly Entertainment and Cuba Gooding Jr. then this is definately for you."
3,Daddy day Camp,This was not as good as Daddy Day Care and they changed the lead actor which always makes it not as good. It has a few funny moments..but it could have been better.
2,Stupid doesnt make funny,"Its true, its not intended to be an oscar winning movie, but that doesnt mean that its supposed to abuse the same joke (spoiler: theres a kid who easily gets sick and throws up) up to three times when its not even funny once. The movie does have some entertaining parts but when it comes to the comparisson to Daddy Day Care it really leaves much to be desired."
1,worst movie ever made,"this movie was so boring , i did not enjoy it at all. it is nothing like daddy daycare . daddy daycare was actually a funny movie. this movie was a waste of time and money , BORING"
2,not Very well done....,Not as good as I hoped it would be... Most of the children didn;t really enjoy it.
3,This is one of those movies....*SPOILERS*,"that you know is going to be silly, but you figure...""Why not?""It was a rainy afternoon, the kids-five boys, 14, 12, 9, 4 and 6 months-were bored and antsy, so I popped some popcorn and put this in. It wasn't Oscar winning material, and a part of me is sad to see Cuba Gooding, Jr continuously in this goofball roles, but it wasn't bad either. Daddy Daycare had Eddie Murphy's comic timing and at the time it was a more original idea. This is recycled material, and Gooding doesn't always hit the mark, but it was a nice family movie. We laughed,and though we knew what was going to happen we still enjoyed the 'underdogs' winning at the end.For a family movie you could certainly do worse."
1,My out of tune Symphony of Bells,"Should call it ""Cacophony of Bells"". The bells are in perfect tune with each other, but NOT with the accompanying electronic music. Some songs are a whole key or two off, actually hurting the discerning ear. Ouch!"
4,My wife loves this....,"This special music box is really nice. The choice of songs, the sound, and the looks makes it very appealing. The only negative I can see is that the power switch is in the back...it would have been nice up front some where for easy access. Other than that, this is a great addition to your household decor, especially for Christmas."
3,has some exercises that other books don't,"I got the book to diversify my flexibility exercises. About half of the exercises i had encountered in other books, but i got some new exercises, so i got some reasonable value."
2,not that different than regular dried pineapple,"Thought that the freeze-drying process would make this a tastier snack, but I find that the flavor is very comparable to plain dried pineapple...which is a lot less expensive. It's good, but just not worth the price to me. However, if you were looking to take pineapple along on your backpacking trip, this would be the way to do it. For home snacking, I'd choose something else."
4,Workable music software for composers,"I liked this software. I used it for 3-4 years until I got a new computer and it apparently was not compatible. Though some parts were hard to figure out and a little tedious, I was able to do everything I wanted with this software--which included writing music in 4 part harmony, a vocal line with an accompaniment, single lines, several verses worth of lyrics, etc. I found all the notations that I needed. Additionally, I was able to make title page entries, play with page numbering and copyright, transpose the whole song, change the size of the measures, easily create a pick-up note, etc.I miss this software. The later cakewalk software does not offer the notational ease of writing that this software provided."
2,Who chose the artists and why?,"This might have been a potentially great collection, but sadly,is a ""falls short"", collection. Ed Sullivan would never have allowed its release, as is. Why are bands like the Dave Clark Five missing completely, when I recollect they were Sullivan's favorite, and performed more often than any other, and trivial artists included? Way too much ""chatter"" of little value is included. Petula Clark was great--I saw all of these performances back then--but her entire song is in,as a few others, when the IMPORTANT ones are brief clips, or missing completely. AFTER Petula had performed a mere 2-3 minutes earlier,they announce, ""The British Are Coming!!!, next"". This looks like a collection someone who just didn't ""get"" that era directed. Hello, Petula Clark was a Brit too, and not in the very, very first wave. Did this have an editor??"
3,More and more of the same,"More edited songs, more unnecessary dialogue and more Supremes, Mamas & Papas, edited Beatles (didn't they have their own DVDs issued?). C'mon guys where are all the classic performers we havent seen yet from the 50's and 60's? Put them out year by year or group them with some kind of consistency. James Brown is on this set several times and they used the same introduction each time! I give this 3 stars for sound and picture and finally showing some Dusty, Darin & Rascals and a full I Get Around. Could have been so much better."
3,Actually a 2.5 rating,"I agree with the other reviews. Narration and extra music between clips is unnecessary and extremely annoying. Watching some performers lip sync is also very disappointing. I just skip over those. There are some performances that are a lot of fun to watch. On the whole, though, I am disappointed and would not recommend this DVD."
4,requested gift,"This was a birthday gift for my boomer age son-in-law, My daughter and he loved it. It brought back old memories"
4,UK OT student!,"I ordered this from the UK, as an OT student I love study cards, pocket guides etc, and this is the only thing available that I could find. These cards cover a lot of information, the majority suitable for me in the UK. Excellent as a revision aid and handy in your pocket during placements. I have laminated some of the cards to help them last."
3,okay for just a quick review,"These cards are not really helpful if you need a more in depth review. Each page of the card gives a quick summary of the diagnosis. I just preferred the books. I was hoping that the cards would be like my friends nursing cards, but they are just like what is stated. Just a quick summary."
3,Good intro summary to th field,I needed a good reference book to the topic of empirical content analysis. This book did a good job at a reasonable price.
5,A great basic primer on content analysis,This book was very helpful to me getting a jump start on content analysis. It has all the basic concepts and is wonderfully concise and clear.
1,The Content Analysis Guidebook,"My paperback version, which I purchased from Amazon, has several missing pages. The following pages are blank: 15,18-19, 22-23, 26-27, 42-43, 30-31,33-34,and 38-39. I haven't tried to read the book, since it might be too confusing. Unfortunately I bought the book in 2006, so of course it is too late to return it."
4,Good plate,"I think my biggest letdown was no Fender engraving on this one, but not a deal breaker. The plate is thick, which is obviously important. Plating is good, and holes are properly beveled and not too small. This allows them to accomodate different variations of screws, as I don't think this plate comes with them.My only issue probably has nothing to do with the plate but the body they are currently on, with the neck currently being used. The current screw holes seem to be too narrowly spaced in width (not length). This is a little odd, since the body seems to be cut for a slightly wider neck. But since the body is aftermarket and all this stuff varies and is a bit of a gamble until you measure everything, I can't really criticize the plate at all."
4,beware of ripoffs from Taiwan,"There's a low cost ""New DVD"" version of this with abominable English subtitles, which you can find on eBay. Evidently, the Japanese was translated into English by Chinese speakers, so Precis is ""Polixisi"", Claude is ""Kuloto"", and worse. Not only is the translation horrible, but the spoken Japanese is absolutely sparkling clear and nothing like the dub. That said, ANY Star Ocean DVD is interesting, and may be worth collecting. If THIS particular set is well-dubbed, and the price suggests it probably is, I'm certainly going to think about buying... which I am ;-)"
3,Good series except for the ending,"All I can say is what the heck. I did like the series it was very good up until the ending. It ends with them going to confront the main enemy. what kind of ending is that. I mean does Claude get home, what happens to Rena, what even happens to the rest of them. Also, do they even figure out where Rena is from :( I always thought a series was supposed to end with the enemy defeated and questions answered. The only other one that I know of that does this is Saint Seiya leaving off with an arrow in the girls chest (I know ADV went out of business but somebody please finish):("
1,This camera takes the worst indoor pictures,"I bought this camera thinking: because its a Nikon it will take great pictures. However, I soon discovered that any picture taken indoors with the flash resulted in round dust orbs or spots appearing in the picture. I had no idea what was causing the problem then, after researching it on internet photogrphy sites, I realized it was a reflection from the flash off of microscopic particles in the air. This made the camera virtually useless indoors. When I contacted Nikon's help number, they acted like they never heard of this problem. Then, a look at their website reveled that they were, in fact, aware of the problem but chose to treat it as an acceptable design flaw - bottom line, the flash is located too close to the lens and results in reflective spots whenever the flash is used. I would definitely not recommend this camera to anyone seeking quality indoor photographs."
2,exactly 1 year later - non functioning camera,"Up until yesterday this camera has been decent. I found this on clearance on Aug 13 last year at a great price. Since the last Panasonic Lumix I had died just after the year warranty, i figured i didn't want to spend $400 for another digital camera since we still love our SLR film camera. We opted for this one. Maybe i am just cursed, but just after one year on this one and poof- no more pictures. The LCD is black except for the on screen display, and I can view pictures in memory. It seems like everything still works, except there is no picture. I don't expect to keep spending decent money on digital camera only to have them break DAYS after the warranty expires. They should not be disposable!"
3,"Decent book, SQL Server 2000 coverage lacking","This book is the same decent book the version 7 book was. That's really the problem -- they're too similar. As some of the other reviews have pointed out, you won't find coverage of XML in this book. Should you expect to? Well, I guess that's debatable. Me, I expected it and was really disappointed when I couldn't find anything on it at all. That said, there's still useful info here. Most of the internals between 7.0 and 2K didn't change much, so the book still applies. Some of the same errors that existed in the 7.0 book are still here, but, mostly, the book gets it right. I guess the final verdict is: if you already own the 7.0 book, don't waste your money. If you don't have the 7.0 book, this book is probably worth reading through."
1,Too much stuff repeated,"This is really the 7.0 book with a pretty adequate find-replace job done on it. None of the new features in 2000 (XML, multi-instancing, server federations) is covered in this book. A real let-down."
1,Lots and lots of errors,"One thing is very clear to me after reading this book. Delaney is not a practicing DBA. He spends far too much time on things DBAs couldn't care less about and far too little on the real important stuff. The worst part of it is the book is loaded with errors. Lots and lots of them. There are three errors in the discussion of RAID that any practicing DBA worth his money should be able to get right. There are numerous errors in the discussion of the query optimizer. I feel sorry for him that he doesn't know the technology any better than this. On top of all this, this is some of the dullest writing I've ever read. I liked the 6.5 book, but this one bores me to tears."
2,"Not that bad, but not that good, either","There's just something missing about this book. I have the 6.5 book and really liked it. Maybe it's the fact that Delaney isn't actually on the Sql development team like Soukup was - I don't know. It's just kinda weak, that's all. I wouldn't say it's not useful, but if you don't already know most of this stuff, you really shouldn't be using the product in the first place. Look elsewhere if you want an in-depth exploration of the internals of the product - it ain't here."
1,Seems like one VERY long whitepaper,"Hardbound or not, this is really just a whitepaper (or a collection of them). I recognize almost all of it from other sources - TechNet, the v7.0 book, MS whitepapers, etc. I suppose I'd be ok with that if the book did what its title implies - cover SQL 2000. But it doesn't. None of the new features are covered at all. My advice is not to waste your time-money on this one."
1,Laughably bad,This book is so horrible. It represents the worst in technical books these days. It's dreadfully dry - like put you to sleep dry. It's redundant. Most if not all of the info in this book is also in the Books Online. Delaney doesn't write well and the book lacks technical depth - it's laughably bad.
2,Not worth the hassle,"The book is too long and too full of stuff straight out of the BOL to be really useful. There's also way too much academic stuff in here and not enough practical application of it. While it's interesting that an allocation map page controls 512K of other pages, why do I care? In only really isolated, extreme circustances would that matter to me (or if I was building my own SQL Server) and in those cases I'd already be on the phone to Microsoft.If you cut out all the stuff that's nigh useless to the practitioner, you have very little of a book left. Me, I didn't feel it was worth all the hassle looking through the bad stuff (much of it very dated) to find the good."
2,Missing many key elements,"I found this one not to be what it was cracked up to be. It's not an internals book about the the product. It's an internals book about *certain* parts of the product. Whole pieces are missing. Where, for example, is the SqlXML internals coverage? Not there? I could list a host of others. I'm so incensed about this that I'm considering returning it. I saw this on a web site that recommended it. I guess I'll have to remember to consider the source on those web sites. The operator is probably a friend of Delaney's."
2,Does CORe = BORing?,"The one is a good sleep aid. Gees! Its just like the other one. Lots of info, not much of it useful."
2,Inside sql server is pretty good but could be better,"While its true that the book is very similar to the previous edition, I don't think thats necessarily bad. The products are very similar - the books should be to. I have the same problem with this version that I had with the last. There's to much stuff left out. IN the 6.5 version, we got everything that was of any consequence about SQL Server, as is the tradition with the Inside books series. In this one, we only get updates of what was covered in the 6.5 version. The problem is, there are lots more new areas of the product. they shoudl be covered to. The book could be so much better and more useful than it is."
2,Inside SQL Server 2000 is okay,"There's nothing terribly wrong with the book, it's just not what I was expecting. I have some of the other Inside books and this one just doesn't live up to them. It's not the comprehensive reference I was expecting. It doesn't cover about half the topics I was interested in, so now I have to go buy another book. That doesn't make it a bad book, it's just that it really doesn't meet my needs."
2,"Not Inside, not really","90% of the stuff in this book can be found elsewhere. First of all, most of it is in the online documentation that comes with Sql Server. Second, nearly all the rest can be downloaded from the MS Web site. Third, anything that's left can be found in other books, including the precursor to this one, Inside Sql Server 7.0. Not only does the book not take you inside Sql Server, it doesn't even include info that you can't find elsewhere. Add to this that Delaney seems like a really inexperienced author and you have a book that's very dull and not very useful."
4,One of the book to keep,A very useful reference combining with microsft web help during database programming
3,Decent Surface Overview,"I've been scouring this book and found that the there is well written overview of SQL, much like a whitepaper. You'll learn about the types of backup/recovery or replication, but you won't learn the how.Given the ""Inside"" in the title, I was hoping this was more in depth and perhaps presented the ""HOW"". I would recommend this for the sales force for SQL Server or general casual reading, but not for people that want to actually do stuff and need to learn that.I did like the history of SQL Server section, which I think is invaluable being a history buff, but I thought that it was unnecessarily defensive about Microsoft's business practices. One has to assume that if we are using the product, we are not openly hostile at Microsoft."
2,Bring back Ron Soukup,"This book lost a lot when it lost Ron Soukup. It's like a really long whitepaper. I recognize a good part of it from TechNet and stuff written by people who work for MicroSoft. If I wanted a whitepaper, I'd just download it. I was expecting a book. Bring back Ron Soukup."
2,A re-run of a mediocre book,"The 7.0 version of this book wasn't that good but this one is even worse. Even more core topics are not covered in any depth or not at all: fail-over, clustering, replication, XML, etc., etc. If ""core"" meant the same thing as it did in the 6.5 book, all of these would be covered. Instead they aren't and we're left with a book with major pieces missing."
2,Beginning to show its age,"I read the first version of this book and thought it was really useful. I don't feel that way about this one. It really needs to be updated. Many key SQL Server 2000 topics are not covered at all. Others have mentioned XML. While I agree that this is certainly worthly of an Inside book, I'm more disappointed by the lack of coverage of high-availability features. People would naturally expect features like this to be covered in a book like this, but, alas, they aren't. The book really needs to be updated."
5,Solid and very readable,"I used this book while researching printmaking during the Renaissance period. Wechler's writing is clear and interesting, and the book provides a detailed overview of printmaking processes and the most important prints and printmakers starting in Europe before the Renaissance. For each print that he examines, Weschler talks about the artist, the historical context, the technique and the subject matter. The images are large, good-quality, and not crowded--one to a page. I would recommend this to anyone interested in art history or printmaking."
3,not remixes---get them only if you are a fan of the guests,"Every mix is just about the same, just that you have a small section with a rap thrown in by either Eve or BG. nothing too impressive here."
1,Didn't work at all on my lawn.,"I used at the concentration for remedy of an existing condition, using two bags on my < 5,000 sq ft lawn. No change after one week.Sorry to post a 1 star but that was my experience. We have both dollar spot and red-thread."
3,Really didnt see a difference,I put this down on my lawn after seeing a fungus. I followed the directions in regards to watering and after four weeks really didn't see any difference in the lawn. I guess every lawn accepts this product differently.
5,It Worked!!!,"I got this for a friend, she was trying to conceive. She wore it 1 month and now is pregnant!! Very great!! Congrats Tracy!!"
5,Kokopelli Bracelet,"I bought this for a friend for Xmas as she is very fond of Native American Indian and when she received it, she absolutely loved it and knew all about this style. It arrived beautifully boxed and very well shipped.ch"
2,Could use an update,"I am an avid follower of Marianne Williamson and A course in Miracles and thought these cards would make a great gift.I thought they would be a combo of A course in Miracles and Tarot, but they are more of a meditation or affirmation subject card.They are definitely dated looking-dreary photography and colors, very 80's looking.Could use an overhaul."
2,Pop-out bottom slips and doesn't work well for liquidy tarts,"I was happy with the look and feel of this pan when I received it. However, when I actually tried to use it, I found several issues with the construction.The pop-out bottom, which is advertised as making cleaning and serving easy, kept slipping when I was handling the pan. The lack of a grip makes carrying this pan a bit hard. If you grip the bottom, the pop-out piece may slip and shift the contents and even break the crust.This pan is not at all suitable for pies and tarts with a porous crust and liquidy filling. Half the filling of my tart leaked out of the bottom since the pop-out bottom is not tightly sealed. From now on, I'll only use this pan if I'm making a pie or tart with a solid pie shell and a solid filling."
5,Fantasic!,This was the best stuff for my first trimester! Even my husband enjoyed nibbling on it. Not too sweet and full of ginger flavor.
3,Nice for the price,"The material was good quality for the price, and works great for a workout shirt. I am 5'4"" and the shirt came a bit short on my torso, especially afetr the wash/dry cycle. I usually order smalls...I recommend ordering a medium if you wear a small, they ran smaller than hoped (you can always shrink it---these definitely will shrink!). Still looks cute for working out and has a bit of stretch to it (and is on the thicker side), so it works great. Great deal, can't beat it."
3,The gutter punk icon,"What a terrible man. I would've never bought his albums if he were still alive in fact. But the guy did have some (limited) talents, as evidenced by some of the very entertaining punk music on this release. It has some hilarious moments like ""I wanna P-- on you"", etc. But it also has some scary stuff like ""I wanna R-- you"" and similar garbage/shock rock. Is it good music? Well, since this guy made Marilyn Manson look like the mother theresa its hard to judge the tunes on their merits alone. But it is good punk rock, and GG did have some talent writing catchy melodies, besides the public's perception of him."
5,"Good condition, as stated, fast delivery",The vendor stated the book was in good condition and it was. The only thing keeping it from being in excellent condition was that it was older paper but that is just fine. The vendor sent this product immediately. It arrived several days earlier than expected.
3,OK ..,"What used to be fun when I was a kid, is sadly no longer as exciting now. I have had high hopes both from Asterix and Tintin, and Father Time has moved me along way too much ..Kids may still enjoy it and find these hard to put down, but I have found it difficult to finish these books.I am currently reading one Asterix book to my 7-year old, but there has been little progress in the last few weeks.Borrow it from your local library prior to buying the entire set ;-)"
1,Item Paid For But Not Recieved Seller Unreachable,I paid for this book but never recieved it. The seller did not respond to my emails and do not give a phone number on their website. I would not recommend seashell books.
5,2 amazing deliveries!,"I used this in combination with the Earth Mama Angel Baby Getting Labor Started CD. They compliment each other very well. I had planned a natural birth in the hospital and was still almost a month out when my OB told me I was going to be induced. I listened to the Getting Labor Started CD throughout the night and come morning she was willing to let my natural labor progress! It progressed so well that by the time I had noticable contractions and began the Natural Labor Companion CD it was only four hours until my daughters birth. My sons delivery was very fast, only one hour thanks to the Getting Labor Started and Natural Labor Companion!"
2,Not worth the $!,"I bought this hoping to add to my cd's for labor, but this was a big disappoinment. I listened to it one time and couldn't even finish it. It was much more yoga then spiritual for me. I can't reccomend this cd."
5,Virtuoso performances and amazing compositions!,"I recently heard FAREWELL [to Mingus] for the first time. I own a number of the Toshiko Akiyoshi big band recordings - both the LA and NYC bands. FAREWELL ranks in my opinion as one of the best - highly focused, energized, striking compositions, great performances by the band and outstanding soloists."
3,tarzan & valley of gold,"This was the first Tarzan movie starring Mike Henry. Mike Henry has the physique and rugged good looks to be one of the greatest Tarzans of all time. Unfortunately, he is trapped in a low budget movie with poor direction and a lame plot. It is an disappointing movie. The only redeeming point is Mike Henry's athletic ability and rugged physique."
3,All the elements are there but...,I saw this movie when it was first released in theaters. Forty five years later I figured out why it never quit blew me away. Tarzan never has a face-to-face meeting with the main villain and in the one encounter he has with the villain's chief henchman there is no dialogue. It's still fun.
1,Defective or can't play it,Doesn't work in a DVD player and computer can't even read it. Very disappointing.
5,A Most Excellent Work,"This is an extremely fine history of Greece up to about 1990. The word MODERN appears in the title even though it starts with Constantine, but this only enriches the total work. Its main virtue is that it weaves the cultural and intellectual life of Greece into the story of national development in the post-Turkish period. Especially good is the way it details 18th and 19th century attempts to develop a national Greek consciousness. It also offers fascinating details on the intellecual currents that led to the armed insurrection against the Ottoman government.Probably deserves more than five stars."
2,Look out for Misprinted Copies,"The book was an excellent read, but I wanted to read about more recent 20th century events, which I couldn't do because the last chapter or section of the book was missing due to some type of misprint. I brought this to Amazon's attention and asked for a new copy of the book, but only if it was correctly printed. I returned the misprinted book and received yet another misprinted book. I tried to explain this issue to Amazon's customer service department, but they didn't seem to have any way to cope with this type of problem or to guarantee that I could receive a correctly printed book. I returned the 2nd book and was never able to finish it."
3,"Sufficient quality text, but lacks suffient maps","This history book did a fairly good job explaining the greek history. However, it only has 4 very poor maps in a 350+ page HISTORY text. In the text there were many references to cities, regions and countries related to significant events, but those places were not shown on any of the maps. I consider this a major flaw. Buy a different book unless you eastern Meditrainian geography very well."
5,Just buy the damn CD,"People don't understand the meaning of good music anymore...they just think if they hear a song on the radio it has to be good. A great song needs to have heart and feeling. 6 or 7 has that potential to become a great band, they already have the great music...almost every song on the CD tells a story and you become so evolved with the music you can't help but know ever song by heart. So what I am saying is... 6 or 7 is a great band and people should buy the CD and go out and see them live...you won't regret it."
5,A Rare CD,"Fluffy Bunny Clouds is a rare CD in that every track is a must-hear. The hooks keep you singing long after the music stops. I prefer the CD to anything on the radio today, and their live shows are always a great time. ...check them out for yourself. All Six or Seven needs is the right person to hear them, and any one of these songs could easily be a hit. This band absolutely has the potential to make it. Call your radio station and request Six or Seven!!"
4,Finally a singer who sings.,"I heard of these guys through a friend of a friend, and you have to catch them live. One of my favorite cds to put in, turn up, and sing along to. One of my favorite break up records. Love ya' Ken C."
4,Fun with Vocal Chords,"Firstly, the song titles listed above aren't song titles at all, they are the titles of the CDs in the Swedish Folk Music series. Ancient Swedish Pastoral Music is music that comes from the vocal chords and lungs (and what powerful lungs they are), from the pastures and fields of Sweden. You'll hear an amazing variety of herding calls, sheep and goat calls, kulning (calling in a vibrato-free high register). There are horns from the meadows: willow bark horn, goat horn. Many of these recordings are remastering of classic radio folk music recorded in the 1950's and 1960's, but there are some more modern musicians like the amazing Lena Willemark (of the Nordic folk bands Frifot and Nordan). The CD closed with a 27 minute live concert recording featuring the vocals of Suzanne Rosenberg (R7), Agnetta Stulpe, Eva Rume, Ana Arunsson and Pella Jacokson. Not for everyone, but if you like the female voice stretched to the limits, give this a try."
4,Girls Just Wanna Have Fun '64,"Producer Sam Katzman sure has his finger on the pulse of America's youth. In previous efforts he defended their right to rock and twist despite the protestations of their disapproving elders. With this film he is championing feminism long before Gloria Steinem burned her bra. No, these ladies are not looking for enacting laws for equal pay for equal work. They want to Watusi! And who better a standard bearer for women's lib than former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley. All kidding aside as camp this is pretty good. Mobley's rendition of the film's title tune is a hoot. The youthful cast is energetic led by Chris Noel, Nancy Sinatra, and Chad Everett best known as that dreamboat Dr. Joe Gannon on ""Medical Center"". The featured acts(The Animals, The Dave Clark Five, The Standells among others) lip synch their songs admirably. Eric Burdon seemed a little stiff on ""Blue Feeling"". He recovers nicely for the film's closing number, ""Around and Around""."
4,Prescient 1950's gay journalism.,"The late Jim Kepner both capsulizes and comments on the news of interest to gays (mostly) and lesbians during the 1950's. He was not only a clear writer, but he also anticipated most of the best arguments that have been put forward since for tolerance and acceptance of homosexuality as natural. A good reminder that gay activism didn't just start with Stonewall."
3,As a series progresses...,"...it can lose some of its bite. I watched all of the episodes contained on here, some of them could be considered shockers, but some are a little ho-hum and outrageous even for this show's standards. Still, I like them for just the nostalgic value and the fact it can be considered in my mind, a family show. Always a good buy for a collector or a real fan."
1,Ugh.,"Nice concept, but very little of it worked. If you're going to write something for yourself, you better make sure it plays up your attributes. Hoashi and the rest of the cast are mostly garbled in this recording and in the show. I saw the show with a friend of mine and was extremely disappointed with the lack of fundamental elements of a good story/musical. The actual music is not too bad, but Hoashi needs to learn how to write lyrics and dialogue."
5,fantasy anime is wonderful,"Taro Hanaukyo is a young boy who has inherited a vast family fortune and more importantly, the near hundreads of employees working at the family mansion. While dressed and referred to nominally as maids, there are discrete albert sometimes unusual departments for most of the employees (including Defence, Science, Catering, etc.). Presumably the various extensive projects in the house pay for most of its expenses."
5,Bride & Groom fishing cake topper,"This cake topper is so cute and very appropriate for my daughter and her fiance, who love to fish. It arrived very quickly and safely. The price was great! I can't wait to see the reaction of their guests when they see this on their wedding cake. It will be a fun keepsake for them long after the wedding is over."
5,Well Constructed,"I love this rosary. I use it daily at home and take it with me when praying away from home. It is beautifully made, just the right size and and well constructed for every day use."
5,Olive Wood Rosary,"This is an excellent rosary for the Holy Season. It is very durable; I left it in my pocket in the wash, it survived with no ill affects. It would make a great gift. No FLASH OR FLUFF.This product is all you need to inspire you to pray. It is not hokey at all, it does not look cheap. It is simple, if you like simplicity then you will adore this rosary."
3,Looks nice but needs constant care.,"I would not buy this unless you are using it for a looker and not going to use it. I had to constantly fix it, as it was breaking all the time. It finally broke where it was not repairable. Now I have the cross on a separate chain and it looks nice, but I really liked the rosary. Oh well. Time to go shopping for another. It took less than a month for this to wear out."
2,Looks nice but buyer beware,"The item looks nice upon arrival and was packaged well. However, within minutes the beads started to fall off as the string broke. I dont think I'd pay this much again for something so cheap. As of now, I have the cross hanging on a piece of twine and I've thrown away the beads."
3,It is what it is,There's not much you can say about this. What you see is exactly what you get. There very light and flimsy. I They were useful enough for a fashion statement.
4,Olive Wood Rosary,"These were accuratly described. They are being given as gifts. Therefore, I have not used them. They seem to be of average construction. They do look good."
2,feels cheap,"it just feels cheap, the metal is extremely thin. the whole piece is extremely light, and it is much smaller then it looks. will be looking for a better rosary for the project i am doing"
1,totally disappointed,"I bought this video hoping to be able to watch and learn. There are no close ups. Close ups are of finish products only. Steps by step images are much too far to actually see what she is doing. An individual is better off buying a book with images at least you can see a close up of a ""how to image"" and what the step should look like. She does give you lots of info but video is defintely not for beginners. I did have a friend who is jewelry maker watch the video and she was not impressed. I must say I was totally disappointed. Not all what I expected from a how to video."
2,Pater Is No Steven Underhill,"I was disappointed in this photo essay of twin brothers. As I do not read German, I am unable to determine if the letters between the brothers and the photographer add any character or structure to the photographs. The brothers seem distant from each other and their nude posing is just that..posing. If you're interested in the idea of twins together invest in Steven Underhill's wonderful photo essay ""Twins""."
5,Wonderful!!!,Very informative documentary on vaccines. Please watch this regardless of your views. THis is not an anti-vaccine video....It is important as parents and health professionals to educate ourselves and question the status quo in order to protect our children.
2,Very depresssing and very unsatisfying ending,"Read Kirkus review. It is right on. This is good writer but as one of the other reviewers commented, I don't have the fogiest idea what the ending is supposed to be all about. If anyone has figured it out, I also would like to know"
5,Armands,"I have had about every Nascar Racing game since Nascar 1, I downloaded the demo for 2003 and just love everything about it. I think this is the best yet. All the choices for settings is great. My side winder Force Feed Wheel works nice with it. Better then it did with Nascar 2002. I will buy it."
5,Sim racing doesn't get any more realistic,"EA Sports doesn't have anything in their invetory that can conpare with this game. Papyrus is way ahead of everyone else when it comes to Racing simulations. Yes...I'm calling it a simulator instead of a game because that's what it is. Dale Earnheardt Jr. has been know to use the game to prepare himself for the next race. Yes folks, it's that realistic. It's a real shame that this was the last edition of this game. Ea sports bought out the license from NSACAR."
3,Best Series Ever But Obviously Rushed To Market,"I have been a huge fan and purchaser of all the Papyrus designed games distributed by Sierra. Be very wary of this sim until a much anticipated ""patch"" arrives. This game causes numerous system crashes/reboots and has got TONS of bugs. If you think the problem is specific to my system only, I invite you to visit the message boards in the community section at Sierra.com. to see the experiences of others as well. It is my opinion that this game was developed very quickly (in under 1 year) and clearly put to market before it was ready to go. Not sure what sort of licensing or deadline deal had to be made.When it does run it clearly outdoes each of its predecessors and is an amazing racing sim. Multiplayer is an absolute MUST and be sure you have a decent internet connection (cable or DSL work best). It would clearly be a 5 star product but until all the bugs, fixes, and obvious hardware compatibility issues are addressed, SIT TIGHT!!!"
5,Nice,"I only have the DEMO and let me tell ya this game has it all, I cant wait for this to hit stores tuesday. What got my attention the most was the new black-flag rules, I sped down pitroad and I got a blackflag saying ""you must drive down pitroad without stopping."" I thought it was the coolest thing, and to see the driver moving inside the car was awesome, I added laps to the demo and ran 194 laps at Dega with 1X wear with that I had to pit every 30 laps or so, I ran the fuel short one time so I can get a longer run. I ran 45 laps and I could not see out my window I actually had to use a different camera in order to keep up, but this is awesome I would say everyone who is into nascar sims to stay away from NT2003 and go right for NR2003"
1,Crashed my computer,"Purchased this game and was looking forward to it. Would not load on a Intel 845PE 2.4 512 memory, TI 4200i GF4 128 video card. This game will not run with Intel IAA program. It has a number of video card issues."
2,Dont get your hopes up...,"I just got this game here and it works fine no problems but if you are thinking of getting it you may want to think of this first: This game is so hard to drive compared to Nascar Racing 2002 Season, its made so it always turns to the left alot. In races you have to keep turning to the right to keep from spinning out, my best lap in Nascar Racing 2002 Season at daytona was like 199.00 mph but in this game it was like 170.00 mph and that was after a week of practice. My advice is to either get last years one or just wait for Nascar Thunder 2004 that is coming out this fall."
2,lacked substance,not what I thought it was. I was hopping for more about his life and teachings. It was really just a lot of interview and opinions. Everyone has an opinion and not worth much
2,Not all that great.,"My daughters and my niece all wanted this for Christmas. The furby was a hit the first day but after that she wasn't so great. it was hard to figure out it's language, you had to talk to it you had to talk in a quiet place. Sorry but it was not what it should have been."
3,Don't pay attention!,"Don't pay attention to me! Ahh,Furby I remember when it was so famous and every kid wanted one.Well I really wasn't like that and I never had the old one.Though I do like that now other young kids get a chance to get this Once very famous toy.Just like i got a chance to buy the great tamagotchi! Anyway,I remember seeing this toy on t.v when i was younger and be really scared about ! Really!To me it does not look cute at all.Yeah now it could dance and play games,but after you play those games after a while,it gets boring...I also thought that the price was really high.Not even tomagotchi costs that much! And it does more then a Furbycould ever do."
3,"Limited, but grows on you!","Compared to the old Furby and Shelby, this toy is very limited. Sings only one song, tells only one story, plays only one game. Bigger and more cuddly than the old models, it seems to be geared for the very young child only. The humor of the old ones entertained the adults, too, but this one does very little in that regard. I hope I can find the ""Easter Eggs"" (hidden tricks) in this one as I did in the old models.I must say, though, that after a couple weeks I became fond of this guy and appreciate him more now. And he definitely makes a better choice for kids than the older models because he is not rude at all."
3,"Strauss ""Lite""","Reiner's approach to the Strauss Viennese style is somewhat inconsistent. For example he takes the Emperor Waltzes in ""straight"" 3/4 time and is thus devoid of the traditional anticipated second beat slightly throwing off the snare drum and mars a tradition that gives the Viennese waltz its uniqueness and charm. He also makes in my judgment a serious error in cutting part of the finale coda...a move which knocks out the necessary tension leading to the grand rise of orchestral forces culminating in the final tympani roll. Other tracks do include some very nice idiosyncratic ""lite"" touches and are delightful. His use of rubato could be a bit more liberally applied. Reiner's tempos are lively and the orchestra responds with polish. The SACD has a fine sound presence in comparison to the analogue CD version.Three stars for interpretation. But for authentic Viennese music making try Karajan, Kempe or Boskovsky."
2,Cartoonish,"This story is full of black or white, good or evil characters, in which the hero, the ""great"" Alabaster, has nearly superhuman powers. All of the women have large breasts. The only humor is unintentional. I was only able to finish it by visualizing a comic book."
2,dave,"Granted this book was his first book and it was published years ago, but the ""Perils of Pauleen"" feel for the protagonist getting into impossible life and death situations and then extracating himself was a bit mutch. Even Ian Flemming didn't have this hyperbole. It was good enough for me to not stop in the middle, but not good enough for me to read this author again."
1,not moisture proof,"Bought this gauge for my wife and her new car. Put it in a tool box in the trunk without even using it. Two months later decided to check the tire pressures with it. Unfortunately a bottle of window cleaner had fallen over in the trunk and leaked. Seems despite the gauge being in a tool box and the window cleaner outside the toolbox, it managed to collect enough moisture to short out the batteries and the device was dead with droplets of water covering the digital display. Never got to use it once. Think mechanical gauges are more robust. Never had a problem with the old stick kind, and they are lot cheaper."
4,"Works well, minor issues","I've had one of these for several years; picked it up a W-mart. It seems quite accurate (when compared to my other gauges) and consistent. My main complaint, a minor one really, is that it works on a timer. Once you turn it on, you've got a minute or so to take your readings before it turns itself off- no matter what. You must turn it back on to keep going.The lighted display is nice for use at night outside. There is no need to reset it after a reading is taken; just use it again and it reads the new value. Like most of these cheap gauges, it does not have a pressure release valve.A perfect product would have a pressure release valve so you could bleed down to your desired pressure, and would turn itself off a minute or so after the last reading is taken. Easily replaceable battery would be a plus. So I gave it 4 stars."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I was in Salt Lake City in August and had the priviledge of hearing The Mormon Tabernacle Choir at their new venue. I was amazed at the astounding voice quality and the beautiful sound of the music.This CD is of very poor quality and certainly does not reflect the clarity of the voices. After listening to the CD once, I will not play it again."
4,Cool book,GhostsAlvin SchwartzReading level: 1-3Your review: This is a good book! I would recommend it. It has really funny illustrations and really good ones too! It isn't a chapter book but it does have 7 funny but not scary stories about ghosts!
1,What were they thinking?,"My 7-year old 2nd-grade daughter has been up for the last two hours because she was frightened by this book that her class read today in school. Out of all of the Halloween stories there are out there this one was chosen? I haven't read it, but my kid did and it scared her. There are hundreds of books out there for ""leveled"" readers that would be more appropriate. You know your child the best. If he or she gets scared easily - think twice before buying this. If your child handles fear better - he or she may love it."
1,I wouldn't give this to ANYONE!!,"I remember when my Dad read this to me when I was 5 I guess, and I got soooo scared by that ""Suzie the Cat"" story, I had constant nightmares EVERY SINGLE NIGHT!! I still remember it to this day! I was sooo scared I tell u! I didn't like the book after my Dad read it, I couldn't even walk past it! Don't buy this for ANYONE no matter what! I'm serious! Don't buy this! If you want to have a child that cries and screams from nightmares all night, then buy it."
3,shrinkage,It was smaller than true to size and shrunk also. I would buy a size larger than you normally get.
3,AT&T phone and plan,"Phone arrived timely but had a new number assigned. Getting my old telephone number transferred required Amazon, AT&T and myself in several calls which was very frustrating. The phone was great, shipping was really good and fast, getting the number pushed over was a pain. Went to store to make new equipment purchase."
4,Carson Halley,"This CD really caught me off guard. I could have sworn that it was unreleased Weezer due to the excellent production quality and the overall sound of the band. The songs (though not well known as of yet) will have a profound effect on your life. There is a nice mix of pop and rockin' goodness, within the same songs! Overall the band has excellent musicianship which is very apparent in the compositions on this album. I can't believe it was self produced! Watch out for this group because they are climbing up the ladder, and fast! A must buy for rock fans!"
4,For those about to rock...,"Talk about a CD! I was amazed by all the inumerable textures and the delightful tone of the disc. v I f you are planning on buying one no name band CD this year, this is it! NO RECORD LABEL OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND THEY STILL KNOW HOW TO STICK IT TO IT! Buy it! YEAH!"
2,Trying to stand on the shoulders of giants doesn't work,"Comparing Tibanna to great bands such as Weezer or Superdrag is a huge joke. Rivers and John can both sing well, where as Tibanna`s lead singer Josh sounds like he's pushing the envelope on even the simplist notes. Somewhat like a famous frog named kermit. Somehow by affiliating themselves with these giants, Tibanna feels as if they are somehow similar to them, but when listening to both back to back, there is a huge difference. Weezer and Superdrag have what Tibanna doesn't, talent."
4,Rock redefined...,"TIBANNA will be huge! If you haven't already purchased their CD, do so immediately! You will regret it for the rest of your days if you don't. It is so exciting to be in on the ground floor of this up and coming rock band. Their energy is contagious and their commitment to success is inspirational. This CD will become a favorite, I assure you, and if you have the opportunity to see them live, make it happen, they are incredible in person. Rock on TIBANNA!"
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED DO NOT BUY,"I did not receive the Champion Laboratory Oil Filter as advertised and paid for. Instead, they ship to you a cheap ""Parts+Plus"" Brand Oil Filter made in Korea. Item is labeled "" P3244 replaces: AC Delco, Champ, Fram, etc."" ... Champion manufactures Mobil 1 Oil Filter in the USA .....This looks like the Walmart Oil Filter for $3 dollars and no shipping !!"
5,just perfect,"I looked and looked for an outdoor clock in stores, but this one was just perfect. It came right away and looks much more expensive than it was. thanks."
2,not as bright as photo,"I bought this product because the mosiac colors looked so bold from the photo and one of the reviews also said it was bright and cheerful. Although, it has more color than most clocks, I was dissapointed because the colors do not look like the photograph at all. The yellow looks more beige, the blue is not cobolt but a dull blue and the red looks more rust brown. It does not look mosiac even from a safe distance. And when you look at it up close, it's obvious that its a poor attempt at replicating mosiac. If I had seen this product at a store, I would not have bought it. I believe the photograph and product description is misleading."
4,Children's Book,"Gorgeous, illustrative stickers are included in this activity book. It should be said that it is also informative, and not merely a sticker book. It would make a good gift for a child."
5,Gift for musician,My son in law requested this gift and the actual product which arrived in a timely fashion lived up to it's expectation.
4,A fun ghostly experience,"This book is great in many senses of the word. Its stories are brief and to the point, delivering the chills and delicious spookiness of old Irish ghost stories. It is very accurate (a story in this book about the Irish bride jumping over a cliff to her death after her newly-wed husband is mistaken for a sleeping guard off-duty and is shot, is also in another of my favorite ghost books, 13 Ghosts. Both stories measure up to each other.) My mother just got back from a trip to Ireland and she got this book for me, and I just started reading it. It is extremely enjoyable to read, and if you love ghost stories that are easy and fun to read, consider this book. It truly is cool."
3,AS-P6000,"+'s: The AS-P6000 product is fairly good, Bass response is very good, speaker is decent. Life on the AMP, that is another story. -'s: I'm waiting to see if they back up their product."
5,very nice sub,"first off, this thing is huge, but to go along with its huge size is its huge sound. this thing gave me everything i was looking for. and the lows are awsome.this thing truly delivers and you wont be dissapointed"
1,Save Your Money,Not impressed. Rarely used and only watched around 10 movies until the amplifier died. The sound was not great either. The subwoofer alone is cheap. Looked at it and laughed. The warranty on this is not good. Be advised. Find a good company with a good warranty. Stay away from this company.
2,Disappointed....a little,"My fault for not doing enough research prior to buying the sub. I purchased the sub for my stereo system. My main speakers are rather small in size but totally efficent and fast. (Totem Mites) The sub was a mismatch. First of all, the sub is too large and massive to compliment the accuracy of the Totems. It simply cannot move in unison with the main speakers. A better match would be a smaller (8"") sub that has faster response and tone. The Athena will hopefully be better suited to our home theather setup. I bought the Athena because I was taken by the low price compared to the size of the unit. I figured I could dial it down and adjust to my liking. There is simply not enough adjustment to get the system tuned correctly.Bottom line. Poor call for stereo system. If I had it to do over again I would spend twice as much in order to get something that really matched the other components and I would not buy a 12"" woofer just because it was inexpensive. I got what I paid for."
1,Nice while it lasted.,"Worked really great for 372 days, then it died.At first I thought it might be a loose connection since it was buzzing, but no luck on that front. I even swapped to a different cable, reset the receiver setting, etc. but no luck. The auto-detect feature that turns it on when detecting a signal still works (light turns green), but no sound comes out no matter what the volume setting."
2,AS-P4000 amplifier died,"My AS-P4000 amplifier fried 1 week before the 1 year warranty was over (thank god). The rest of the components carry a 5 year warranty but I was worried from the day I bought it.I use the speaker-in inputs as opposed to the line-in because my receiver doesn't have a sub-out (O.K., I know, time for a new receiver). Anyway, I didn't push this thing very hard so was very surprised to discover it wasn't working one day.I like and own other Athena speakers but probably wouldn't buy another of their subs. In any event, they've been bought out by Klipsch (since Klipsch bought API who owns Athena)."
3,Great subwoofer but lousy amplifier!,I bought this amp a few years back and was very happy with my purchase. Then the amplifier died and I wasn't so happy with my purchase anymore - plus it was out of warranty. These Athena subs are notorious for this problem. I bought another amp to replace the dead one so overall the Athena was an expensive purchase but I loved the sound so I bought another amp rather than just ditching it. I brought it back to life and I still love the sound.I just wish Athena had fixed the issue. And I wish Athena was still around.
2,Lacks information on Mack trucks of the 1950 's era,I bought the book looking for information on the LTL and W 71 model Macks. There was very little info on the LTL and none on the W71. There was very little info on the H model. The book might be good for someone wanting some general knowledge on a wide variety of trucks.
5,Very happy with purchase,"Easy to install, easy to clean and very comfortable. Much better than my old wooden seat both in comfort and ease of cleaning, from now on I will be buying only plastic seats."
4,Well it's a toilet seat...,It's a snap to install and can easily be taken off for cleaning. I went through a couple of wooden toilet seats and the finish always came off but so far this seat is perfect. I just wish it had whisper close
4,Great,"Easy to install, clean and change, I would recommend this item. Just make sure you get the right size for your toilet"
4,Good inexpensive toilet seat,"This is a decent inexpensive toilet seat that seems to be working pretty good after a couple months of ownership. One thing I have noticed is that if you shut the lid and sit on it you can feel the lid sink in a little bit. I'm not a huge guy, about 190-200 lbs, but I do notice it when I'm in there sitting with my kid while he's using his potty chair.The inner seat seems plenty sturdy to me so if you don't ever sit on the lid you'll never notice it."
3,"Good seat, but surface can be damaged very easily","My wife and I both like these seats. They are comfortable, not cold compared to other seats, and easily remove for cleaning. They also when in place are solid. One thing I don't like is the surface easily gets worn off while cleaning. I used my finger nail on it to remove the glue from a sticker that comes on it and it wore off the finish. When cleaning only use sponges or something very non abrasive - don't even use a finger nail - otherwise the surface will wear off. Disappointed in how easily the surface can be worn off - especially since they put a stupid sticker on the seat that you need to use a little force to get the glue off that is left behind from peeling the sticker off. Otherwise good seat."
4,Good product.,"Well, buying a toilet seat appeared to be not that black and white. I mean it makes a difference what material it is made of. I will never buy a wooden seat. The plastic seats are so much more durable and hygenic in my opinion. They are easier to clean. They look nice and clean for longer. This plastic seat is quite good. The plastic is lighter than I'd expect it to be. But it is still good."
4,A solid foundation,"Easy installation, and it does not fall on its own during critical standing stream operations, which is a plus. I've found this toilet seat to provide a fairly solid base for most seated toilet activities. I'm sending one to the President so he doesn't fall off while he's flushing the entire economy."
5,A Must-Have CD,"I first heard of Emerald Rose at the Bardic Circle on Witchvox. ""Freya, Shakti"", ""Fire in the Head"": these quickly became two of my favorite songs. The live Fire in the Head rose to my most-listened song very quickly. I lived off of MP3.com for some time.When I came to buy an ER CD, this was high on the list. I came into it loving Freya, Shakti and Fire in the Head. ""Pagan Girl"" I had heard wonderful things about (I understand why: a GREAT song).Penny in the Well and Merry May Folk are just awesome songs. This is my CD of choice when I drive, now.All in all, I am able to listen to this CD almost non-stop, skipping only 2 songs that I don't particularly like.I HIGHLY recommend this CD as one of the greatest musical compilations that I own."
3,This book is deceptively about South Africa,"and while I may be accused of missing the point, I found the relationship between Ruben and Tessa extremely annoying. I bought the book thinking it would deal more with the South Africa of today, but even that was trite, with violence and corruption the two prevalent elements. As I read on, Ruben became a joke of an old man and Tessa a sadistic tease. I did enjoy A Dry White Season and why this author has decided to sink into the musings of an old man rather than explore more about South Africa and the myriad layers of its society after apartheid is a mystery to me. I must admit that I did read through it avidly and with some anticipation, assuming there would be some deeper meaning. If there is, I will have to have it explained to me because I didn't find it. It is well written and easy to read but certainly no more than that. One would be advised to read Disgrace by J. M. Coetzee instead."
5,Exactly as advertised.,These are useful hooks. Don't forget they only hold a pound; about the weight of a wet washcloth. BuyCommand(TM) Utility Hooks w/Adhesive Strips 17003 Largeif you want something stronger.Don't forget the instructions to: 1) prep the mounting site with alcohol; 2) press hard 3) wait for the adhesive to set before using the hook.
4,Does the job...,"Like all Command hooks, these do the job for which they are intended very well.Reading the other reviews, I was surprised to see that someone thought that raincoats should be hangable on these. For that kind of job you need the large metal hooks. These hooks are for things like potholders, small hangings (I use it to hold various wreaths during each season), etc. And for use in the bathroom, there are speciality hooks with special adhesive that resists water. So these aren't for that application either.But for use on a normal wall, for items of lesser weight (they list a 2lb limit right on the package), these hooks work well and remove without leaving residue on the wall."
1,poor adhesive,"I bought two of these hooks,neither one of them stayed attached to the door. I initially bought a larger hook which held up to 3 pounds. I followed instructions and hung up the decorative wreath. The hook and wreath stayed attached for about one hour, then fell off the door. The second hook I purchased was for a 5 pound limit. I followed instructions again and this time the hook and adhesive both came off the door...approximately 15 minutes after it was mounted. The tape backing on the wall side was barely sticky enough to attach to my finger so it was no wonder it wouldn't stay on the door. I have used these hooks before and they have worked but it appears 3m is taking short cuts or has made changes to its product because these recent purchases have been a waste of money."
2,very very small,"there is a sense of fragility with these, wondering if they are sturdy enough to hold a raincoat e.g.but most of all, their size is vastly disappointing, these are indeed very small!!! and hence vastly overpriced...the hook portion is about 5/8"" long, and thin...update...i would like to lower this to a one star, better yet..zero..we placed some on the tile shower wall, high and well away from water and spray...they would NOT stick...we followed directions...what a waste of money...and they are even more overpriced with limited use ability."
1,Not a value pack,"I ordered this in the woodpecker variety, also advertised as a value pack of TEN cakes and received only ONE cake. The company said these items are listed incorrectly on Amazon and issued me a credit."
3,OK book.,"The tunes in this book are mostly session standards in America, and it could be useful because of that. Personally, I know most of the tunes in this book from playing at sessions. What would make it useful, that it is notably missing, would be chords. I know that there are many possible ways to set chords to any tune, but it would be nice to have something you could just put in front of a guitar player that they could read. I think you would be better off learning the tunes by ear (get a minidisc recorder or something). Chords would make this useful, but, as it is, I can't really recommend this collection."
2,Disappointing!,"I purchased this CD set because it had many songs that reminded me of the good old days. On the cover it did say ""New stereo recordings by the original artists."" I figured it would be alright because it was the original artists. I was disappointed after listening to the songs. They didn't sound like the songs that I fondly remembered. I realize that artists want to express their creativity and not do things the same all the time. That's not what I purchased these CDs for. I wanted to hear the songs the way I remembered them while cruising back in the '70s. This CD set is OK if you just want the songs and don't mind that they don't sound exactly like the original recordings. If you're looking for a trip down memory lane, forget about it. You'd be better off getting compilations with the original recordings. Also, I wouldn't trust the MP3 downloads. They aren't accurate. Todd Rundgren's Hello It's Me is a re-recording but isn't listed as such."
5,Romantic look at the Wisconsin outdoors,"As an ex Badger and outdoor writer, I am a real sucker for these kinds of anthologies. This one was particularly attractive, because I knew many of the writers, having written for Chuck Petrie's Wisconsin Sportsman Magazine once upon a distant time and having worked at a Madison radio station with ""Pappa Hambone,"" the radio stage name for the late George Vukelich. The book did not dissappoint. The stories were well chosen to cover the spectrum of activities and seasons in Wisconsin. I was especially touched by ""Christmas at Bridge Pool,"" the contribution by Papa Hambone. That story alone is worth the price of the book. It provide new inspiration for me to continue as an outdoor writer, now living in far off (but much warmer) northern California. Wisconsin Seasons is well worth the time."
4,A Good Book,Overall this is a great investment book. It covers an extremely broad range of topics and for the most part the reader cannot go too far wrong following the author's advice. The sections on the nature of markets and his advice on commodities alone makes the book worthwhile. Bear in mind that the book was published in 1994 but most of the content is timeless. Another book with much of the same advice is The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need by Andrew Tobias. One additional thing- some of the charts and tables and examples date from the 1970's and are evidently from magazine articles that the author wrote. Just so you know what you are buying. The example are good ones and mostly remain relevant today. The only real limitation of the book is Train's simplistic approach to growth stock picking.
5,What A Book,"It is impossible to praise this book enough. I have been actively investing for greater than 10 years, and I have read more books than I care to count. You will feel much more confident in your investing and making choices. I finally have a good grip on why do stocks go up and down. But you get insight into other matters as well ,and get to feel the wisdom of a true master,in a well written easy style. Just what we need during this deflating bubble we are in now."
4,jazz at its best,one of the few crusader albums that took so long to re-issue. i have the album and just bought the cd. a must for the jazz crusader fan.
2,Average attempt,"I love the (Jazz)Crusaders but this one didn't work for me. Their 1966 salsa rhythms sound amateurish compared to ""Brazil '66"" who hit the sound right on the head. Kinda neat hearing an early recording, but misses the mark. Sorry..."
1,Thought it was new,"I bought this thinking it was new. The CD came unwrapped and the case was cracked. Happy to have the music, but unhappy with the packaging."
4,"Ok, but could be better.","These clamps work fin on most larger diameter tubes. If you try to use them on a light stand, they're too wide for the mast, but not by much. You might need to find some sort of metal cap to go over the bolt so it can get a firm grip on tube diameters slightly smaller than what the clamp is designed for.Not sure I like the fact that these don't have any rubber padding to protect the finnish of whatever the clamp is used on, or that it has a ribbed form which puts two sharp edges in contact with the tube. That can't be good for the finnish.I also don't like where the graple fixture is located for bolting the light to in relation to the clamp's thumb-screw knob. Kind of gets in the way of the light's yoke, especially split yokes."
3,fair for what it is,"This clamp is very good for what it is. I mean you don't want to hang anything very heavy with it, but works great and aren't as bulky as the heavy duty clamps."
3,Note the layout of this clamp before purchasing,"Please note that the mounting bolt for the light fixture and the tightening screw are placed so close together that you can't use this clamp to mount most fixtures vertically - like on the shaft of a stand. It only works on the horizontal part of a stand or truss.Both Chauvet and American DJ make clamps with the mounting bolt on the wide part of the clamp. These clamps can be used both horizontally and vertically, but they're more expensive.It's just something to be aware of."
5,easy,great clamp to hang up my laser lighting equipment to my truss. holds tight and don't have to worry of it falling
4,"Works, but not perfect","this is a good little clamp that does the job but it will tear your truss apart if your not careful. i place a rubber band between the clamp and the bar to prevent severe damages, but otherwise, gets the job done."
3,"Nice Atributes, but Stylistically Weird","These are without a doubt well made boots, of good construction and material, but when you take them out of the box, they have what is to my perception a verry strange style to them. They look for all the world like some sort of prehistoric creature, with a furry ridge running down its back rather like Pumbaa, in th Lion King. If this your taste go for it,these boots are going to be warm and comfy, and could be fun if you know how to play them, especially at the greatly reduced price. I myself will go with something a bit less shall we say ""circusy""."
4,Nice Boots,"Having never ordered this brand of boot before I was a little hesitant. Loved the way they looked when they came in and the fit is pretty good. It does seem like there's a little something off with the heel which made my toes slide in at first making me think they were too small. But, because I liked them so much, I have learned to walk more on my heel with these on and it works out fine. For the price, you can't beat the look of these boots. Definitely worth the money!"
5,Chocolate Bunny!,I purchased these for my grandaughter who resides in the big apple...winter will come again. Good sale price on an excellent product!!
3,Good buy,The boots looked like expected. The fit was a bit unusal but once you wear them around for a few minutes you adjust. Really warm boots with padding straight down to the toes. I gave it 3 stars because of the fit but otherwise great boots.
2,Bearpaw Eskimo Boot,"I received the boots promptly but found them uncomfortable. I ordered 9's b/c of other reviews that said they run small. However, I found these too big. More problematic is the cut of the boot: the instep, or part where the foot part meets the shaft of the boot, sits way too far out on the foot so that the bend of your foot/ankle does not line up with the bend of the boot. This makes them feel very stiff and loose. I will be returning them. Unfortunate b/c the lug soles are great and the quality seemed fine."
5,Wonderful boots,I would definitely encourage this purchase. The boots are of very good quality and the treading on the bottom seems like it will hold up in cold weather. I would definitely recommend these boots
5,Wonderful buy and great fit...perfect for cold Winters in the South!,"I bought a pair of Eskimo Bearpaw boots last Winter and absolutely loved them. Wore them with my jeans and leggings and had no problems keeping my feet warm, dry and comfortable on cold concrete as I did my ""court yard"" duty every morning in the cold Winter we had last year. My students love them...they feel great and if you feel you need a bit of support,insert some soles from the drug store...but I have never had a problem with these boots. They are true to size so wear thin socks or sock liners...or leggings."
3,bad fit,I own bearpaw boots that I luv - I wear a solid size 9 but these were way too small - need to upsize
3,Odd fit,"This is a great looking winter boot but the fit is very odd. The heel is wide and my foot slides. It eats my socks so I put a lambs wool sole liner in it. The liner helps but it is not perfect. Wearing no socks is am option, but it is winter!"
1,ill-fitting,"Bearpaw fits horribly - tight through the toes and loose about the heel. I tried two different pairs (one order) with the same experience. And to make matters worse, Clausette charges an 8% restocking fee in addition to paying to return the merch, which was exorbitant in the first place."
4,I love it,This furby is amazing it really does work but the only bad thing is it says the same thing over and over but other than that its so fun.
4,FUN BUT THE BATTERY LIFE EXPIRES TOO SOON.,I PURCHASHED THE NEW FURBY A LITTLE BIT OVER A MONTH AGO.MYSELF AND THE KIDS ENJOY FURBY VERY MUCH. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I SEEM TO HAVE IS THE BATTERY LIFE. WHEN FURBY SPEAKS HE MAKES A FUNNY SOUND LIKE SOME TYPE OF AUDIO TRANSMISSION.
5,"The CUTEST, FUNEST, TOY EVER!","This toy is so fun to play with. Its like way better then the old ones. The coolest thing about it is it can really understand you, and talk back to you. And also it is like so cute. I just love it so much."
4,The Robot Reveled,"EEK!!! I'v had my furby for about a year and a half, and its lips are peeling. They are cracking and it's almost like they're rotting. It's kinda weird, the same thing happened to my mio pup."
4,Furby revisted,"My 7 yr old daughter received this toy along with Scamp My Playful pup. My nephews have the original Furby & were fasinated by this one. At first we didn't think it was working properly, but after a couple of days of interaction, it had gotten better. Both my husband enjoy playing with Furby, as much as my daughter. She said it's an e-toy (electronic toy)! At times it even responded to the Scamp pup. IT also teaching my daughter imagination & how to look up Furbish & respond back"
2,TRUE DESCRIPTION PLEASE,"Being a person who only buys leather shoes - I was not very pleased when I got these that have ""man-made material"" marked on. The product description, on which I rely heavily says leather - that's misrepresentation"
1,stay away,"I've had mine (steelfish x-plus) since 2007 and there is one probem. It doesn't keep time. If I take it off my wrist for more than 2 hours, it stops. After winding and wearing it, it takes about 2 days to get to the point where it loses about 15 seconds every hour, never gets any more accurate than that. Making an attempt to get it fixed (god knows what that will cost) when I am in Vancouver in Feb/09 and if that doesn't work, I'm just going to chalk the watch up to exprience."
4,Heavy duty rubber seal,The rubber seal construction is very good. The attachment hold tight. The rubber seal takes some time to get a memory for the doors. The doors need to be slammed to get closed.
4,Sessions and his Art,"My first introduction to Roger Sessions' music was his First Symphony on this recording. I found it while browsing around in the library. The first movement was a mind-blower. Instantly accessible, great rhythms, and good and loud. I wondered what other wonders were on this CD. Well, my first impression was that it was akin to white noise. I love Lutoslawski and Penderecki and it seemed to be noise. However, I gave it a second shot, and a third, and so on and the OTHER wonders of his music became apparent. Get this CD, give it a chance, and it'll grow on you. I have most of his symphonies and have several other pieces and I'm going to get more soon."
3,Honda P/S Fluid,"Can't rate this item, as I was sent Johnson's P/S Fluid and not the Honda OEM Fluid I ordered. The Johnson's P/S Fluid seems to work well however."
4,"Gong - 'Live At Sheffield,1974' (New Rose) 4 1/2 stars","First off,please do keep in mind this import CD may be tough to locate a copy of.Nearly as outstanding as it's companion disc 'Live In Paris:Bataclan 1973'(see my review).Sound quality couldn't be better.Most memorable tracks are the eleven-minute ""Crystal Gnome"",""Mister Pyxie"",Tim Blake's ""Deep In The Sky"",""Flying Teapot"" and their somewhat obnoxious ""You Can't Kill Me"".The last tune is from a Glastonbury,1989 gig ""Titicaca"" where I guess Gilli Smyth provides the vocals and Daevid Allen plays acoustic guitar.Nice little folk ditty.Smyth is listed in the credits but I didn't hear her very much during this archive show.Line-up:Allen-guitar&vocals,Smyth-space whispers,Didier Malherbe-sax&flute,Tim Blake-synth,Steve Hillage-guitar,Mike Howlett-bass and Pierre Moerlen-drums.A must-have."
1,Alien Worlds 20 Movie Pack,"I bought this pack thinking I couldn't go wrong for $6 or $7 dollars. I was wrong. The production quality of the movies is not very good. Four or five don't play on my DVD players (I have three). Some that do skip and jump. I would never buy this again, especially if it was from Mill Creek Entertainment. Buyer beware!"
5,Very good,"Good shipping. This is not for small children. It is good for olders kids. It is a lot of fun. It can be too messy , you have to handle it with care."
2,read if you like skipping to the more interesting chapters,"i usually let my daughter read up on a book before i buy it but not this time and she was definately dissappointed, i had to constantly remind her to read it or even ask her if she read the book each time she complained about being bored, maybe her being age 14 has a little to do with it because at that age they basically like more drama"
4,Christmas Tree storage bag,This is a great storage bag for relatively low cost. It works great and keeps the dust off your tree...
5,Great product,This bag has plenty of room for large trees and is really heavy duty. Smaller trees may even fit in it while they are still assembled. It is a great product.
2,Tree Storage Bag,You get what you pay for on this one. The bag tears pretty easily because the material used to make it is one step above trash bag plastic. The only saving grace for this product is it's massive capacity. Holds a 7 footer no problem. Just make sure you keep the metal from the tree away from the bag edges or else its ripsville.
2,Just a big green bag,"I bought this thinking it was a great deal, but it wasnt. It is just a big green plastic bag. You cannot see through it, so its pretty useless for storage of multiple items. The plastic is not really thick, sure its not saran-wrap, but its not even as thick as duct tape. It opens from the Side, so getting things in and out of it is pretty annoying. In general, it does the job, but its nothing spectacular."
4,Tree Bag,"Sturdy, yet lightweight. Easier than storing an artifical tree in a box. Able to move into smaller spaces."
4,Christmas Tree Bag,"So far--so good. My 7 1/2 foot Christmas tree had no problems fitting into this bad, in three seperate pieces. Material seems strong. Still..this is my first year of storage...so I'll give you an update next year!"
3,Storing the tree,"The bags were received farily quickly and were of course new. They were priced at I what I thougt were a good price. However, I thought that the shipping was a bit high."
2,oversize plastic bag,picture this.... put the tree in this bag had to store it in the attic. pull down stairs. not easy.
4,Great bag for the money,I had a little trouble getting my xmas tree back into the original box. I went to Amazon and hastily reviewed several tree bags and this one seemed to have good reviews. I had it shipped next day air. The bag itself is made of a fairly strong plastic and had plenty of room for my 7 1/2 foot tree once it was dismantled. The straps and zipper seem secure enough. It is a bit difficult to carry once the tree is inside but over all a decent solution at a good price
3,tree bag,"This is not a bad product at all but be warned this bag is friggin HUGE!!! And when it has your tree or whatever in it, its very heavy and difficult to move. I am just going to go back to storing my christmas tree in a large storage tote. Its a whole lot easier to deal with that way! This bag would be great for maybe burying a dead body in!"
4,Sturdier than it looks.,"When I pulled this out of the package, I never thought our 7ft. tree would fit, but after it's all opened up, it's huge. The tree fit, with a wreath, and a few other light tall decorations with room to spare. The plastic seems sturdier than I originally thought, but this is the first year, so time will tell."
4,Tough use,"We purchased these to store our tree. Tree is over 10ft tall & it's VERY WIDE & HEAVY. Bought two, there was no way in heck that the whole tree would fit into one. With that said, it has worn well with what we have put it thru and demanded of it. Yes after 4 years of towing the line it has gotten rips in it. These are from the metal poles & stuff. I have duct taped them & it still works great. BTW, when I mean heavy I am talking 110+lbs each. I am guessing lightly. I can pick up my 12yr old 117lb son more easily then the bags with the trees. With my impatience for my husbands help (again heavy tree) I have dragged the bags on the cement to get them into the house."
2,Interesting...but that's about all,"One star for every song worth paying for. I love Velvet Teen's original sound...love the other records...this one is interesting...promising? The first track is the best, has some great sounds, amazing drums, good driving guitar, amazing vox. The second track is a waste, Alvin & the chipmunks do The Velvet Teen, it finally gets good 3:30 into the song. The third is a really good acoustic song. We'll have to wait until the full length comes out to understand why these three eclectic songs were put together."
1,"poor quality, bad spacing on brackets","The sanding on this shelf was poorly done and requires more work. And the brackets are spaced at 28"", rather than the 32"" that is required to go stud to stud. So with only one screw holding up each side, you can only anchor it in drywall. That means that you can't put much weight on the shelf. Very disappointed..."
5,Another triumph of the McCourt spirit!,"The story of the McCourt Family continues. If I have any regret about this book, `tis that I read the bound version, whereas I listened to the unabridged audio versions of the other installments: Angela's Ashes,`Tis, and A Monk Swimming. The tapes are a richer experience, as one is drawn in by the brothers McCourt recounting their own tales - the joyous lilting highs and the flat out lows.Included is a description of Angela's death by BINGO (in Malachy's inimitable style, he attributes this almost-addiction to the beginning of her end) and discourse on such diverse matters as Nixon, VietNam, conservatism amongst Irish-Americans, and the care of the mentally ill and developmentally disabled.I heartily recommend it!"
1,Enough Already,"That's it, I've had it with the lesser McCourt. This ""inspirational"" blather is a cynical attempt to cash in on brotherly success."
3,Nice but not sure how accurate.,"Maybe it's because of where I chose to hang this, but it doesn't seem very accurate. I'm still glad I ordered it because it's pretty/decorative."
4,A true behind the scenes look at the business world.........,"Go behind locked doors of boardrooms (and bedrooms) of the rich and powerful to witness one of the biggest & sensational business conspiracies in fictional history. How one man seizes the opportunity to push the company he works for into a takeover bid against an even larger corporation in an attempt to further his own already spectacular career. He uses sex, bribery, corruption and a lot of other things you don't learn in business school. Although fictional, this is a believable novel. I really liked the style of writing - I truly enjoyed this book!"
5,Extreme III 8 gig card,"Hmmmm. What can I say about a CF card. I bought this because I'm a compulsive clicker with my Canon 40D, and my old 4gb card was filling up too fast on some of my outings. This 8gb card gives me 616 shots shooting at ISO 100. So far, I have never filled it up before I have a chance to download. I was definitely going to purchase an 8gb card, so when Amazon ran this one on sale, I got it."
4,"Excellent capacity, a little slower than I'd like","This card is excellent for most DSLR use. I can store about 1100 JPEGs or 200 RAW with my D300. New buyers should know this card does nor support UDMA so the speed is only around 60% as fast as the new UDMA cards. However, depending on your camera, it can still handle endless continuous JPEGS (As long as you set it to a lower quality) but still perfectly acceptable for high motion photography."
1,Extremely bad customer service,"I had one of these cards burn up while downloading pictures. So I lost about 350 images.But getting the card replaced turned into a LOT of messages back and forth from the ""Customer Service"" department. They just keep sending stock ""Trouble shooting"" tips instead of reading my messages or issuing and RMA. They don't seem to have any intention of replacing the card. And at this point, I'm just going to post the card on the wall of our rental studio with a printout of all the messages from the ""support team""Maybe the 300+ people who use the studio will get the message, never buy Sandisk again.I own quite a few 4-16GB CF and SD cards. I'm putting them on eBay before I lose more data."
1,Watch Out for Fakes: Buy Through Reptable Stores,"The rating has nothing to do with the product quality. I bought this card from an individual versus one of the main stores. Make sure you can find the serial number on the CF card when you open it. If you cannot find one, guess what? You got a fake. Some cheap card with the Extreme sticker on it. Other things to look for: Was there a hologram on the box? Was the plastic casing sealed shut or were you able to pull it open with no effort? But definitely look for the serial number!"
1,Damaged Camera,"I purchased the Compact Flash Unit. I have used four other lower capacity units made by the same manufacturer in my Canon Rebel XT. When I put this unit in I received an error message. Subsequently, I had to have my camera repaired at a cost $154.72 . San Disk replaced the Flash Unit but has refused to reimburse me for my cost to repair the camera. I am extremely disappointed."
5,Excellent performance,Purchased this item to go along with a Sony A200K DSLR. It had very quick performance on all file types including RAW format at 10 megapixals. It handled continuous shooting without any problem and did not slow the camera down. I would definitely recommend this card for anyone needing a high capicity quick read/write CompactFlash card.
4,Good solid product and works as advertised,"I use it on a Canon 40D. This gives me around 580 photos per 8GB RAW format. The writing is fast considering the 6.5fps from 40D. After the 17 RAW continuous shots, I need to wait for 3-5 seconds for all the data to be recorded.I am happy with the purchase and recommend it.Given 4 stars as I have taken max 1000 shots and yet to put it to real stress. The lag of 3-5 seconds after continuous shooting also is a downer but this is not a very regular scenario and hence I am satisfied with the purchase."
5,Excellent CF card. Fast and reliable.,I use this card with my 50D and when I shoot in RAW I get about 330 shots but in jpeg over 1000. The card is extremely fast and keeps up with the 50D when I chase my niece and nephew around. I was able to take multiple shot of them going down slides and running. The card didn't miss a beat when I was shooting high speed continuous.Highly recommended.
3,have one that is great and one that is defective...,"I have one Scandisk 8g extreme iii that is great- I shoot RAW on my nikon d300 and it's super fast and loads very quickly onto my mac. HOWEVER, I have another one that just stopped working. It is un-readable by my camera and my computer. Fortunately I got all the images off of it. I contacted scanisk and they're sending me a new one, though it will take a while, so I am still going to have to get another one to use since I shoot weddings. Kind of annoyed. Oh well, here's to hoping my other one holds up!"
4,works for me,Works fine w/ my Canon 30D. I'm not into utilizing high-speed photography so I can't really comment on transfer speeds but it works great for me.
5,Monsterous Storage! GET ONE!,"Very fast, very reliable and used in an olympus 8080 with thousands upons thousands of super fine resolution huge jpegs. I used it with a Nikon D200 with well over a 1,000 raw files and 4-5,000 jpegs on various fine settings. I recommend it and watch the pricing, I paid about $10 less than I currently see it listed, however, go to a local store and see it at triple the pice easily. If you use or want to give a gift for a photo person this is it!"
4,digital camera memmory cards,Works great with 5 fps or greater digital SLRs. On a Nikon D300 I can shoot continuously for 15-20 seconds generating more than 100 frames w/o any errors and amazing refresh rates!
4,Yes Indeed This Maama-Jaama Is Fast,"This card is super fast and works great in my Canon 40d. Damn near zero lag with snapping pics super fast. The only thing I don't like about this card is the price. In recessionary times like this with falling memory prices this card and others like it should be much cheaper by now... about 50% cheaper. I expect over the next few months the price of these cards will drop significantly, too bad I couldn't wait until then. If your looking for speed , make sure you get the SanDisk FireWire card reader too. It transfers at about 1 gigabyte per minute, which is fast...Dont get the USB card reader because its not as fast. Anything less than Extreme III sucks if you need to snap pictures fast."
4,"Its huge and fast, although not so impressively fast","I used this to take pictures of a wedding, the space was great and completely neccesary and the speed is great too. I never had to think about the card because it was doing its work so well. I used it on a rebel xti and the speed of the camera improved (of course) over a Ultra II San Disc card. After I used it on a 40D and worked like a charm. The thing is, although it is noticeably faster, Im not completely impressed with it. When I transfered the files to the computer I used a USB II port and the speed was around 10MB/sec not 30. Maybe Im wrong in some interpretation here... I dont know. Thats not so important, the important thing is that the card never limits one to take pictures becouse it cant save fast enough.Bottom line, its great, it does it work well and as far as I know I recommend it."
3,SanDisk 8 GB Card---not the Extreme III as advertised,"The 8 GB card from this vendor works fine. However, I needed it for a research trip to Africa with no chance to re-shoot key photographs so it had to record, store and later reproduce images flawlessly. Problem is that the vendor did not send what I ordered. I ordered an Extreme III card. I did not get an Extreme III card. When I inquired, vendor said the one they sent was better than the Extreme III. I did not have time to research response. Since I used Extreme III previously, I wanted that particular one. Vendor should have contacted me BEFORE sending the ""replacement."" That would have been the appropriate thing to do and not caused me concern that I might be relying on an inferior product...or perhaps a ""knockoff."""
4,Rudhyar practically invented the New Age.....,"As a seeker, astrologer & philosopher, Dane Rudhyar practically invented the New Age. But his compositions bear no resemblance to the wallpaper music New Agers use to take snoozes disguised as meditation. Rudhyar composed to be listened to with complete attentiveness. His music can be dissonant, but it is not a dissonance of anger. Like Charles Ives, he was mining for sound in a place where words were inadequate. Eventually, astrology received Rudhyar's full attention, but he left this music behind to demonstrate other possibilities."
1,twisted to say the least,"Demented. This film has nothing like a storyline in it. If your looking for skin its here but look else were anyway. The plot was weak and sick a real pain to force myself to sit through this twisted waste of time. There just isnt the words to properly convey just how bad an experience watching this was. If I can spare just one person the misery of seeing this @$%#, then i didnt suffer it for nothing. If you read this and see it anyway, I told you so."
2,Bof,Not great. Cheap. Girls sex. Not recommended. Try some other movies. Soft porn. Bah. 2 stars or even 1 star
2,No even interesting,"I think previous reviews covered it but generally this movie is pretentious, hard to follow (what's the deal with the angels?, what's that strange soundtrack about hell?) - maybe its a 'lost in translation' situation but really not all that interesting. It is well shot however...if that helps."
3,editing,I thought the blout well done for this type of movie. the editing suchs though. they move from one scene to a scene that could be minutes or hours later with no transciention.
1,this film has grotesque violence at its end,"This film appears okay until its second half, which ends with destructive violence against the director's body. Totally uncalled for. This is an ugly film. I think the director of this ""Exterminating Angels"" movie (who also wrote this movie's script) was himself a victim of destructive violence against his own body (male circumcision), and that, working its way thru his unconscious mind, resulted in this awful movie."
2,Girl on Girl soft porn,"Exterminating angels should have just taken it one step farther and made it a porno. I know there was supposed to be some sort of message behind this so called artsy film but all I took away from it was a voyeur getting his jollies by watching damaged young girls masturbating themselves and others. I must be dense or maybe didn't read fast enough to catch the meaning behind this film, but I truly didn't see any real reason for making it. If you're looking for a lot of girl on girl action and don't mind reading your porn, this one might be for you."
2,A let down to the title!,The title is so promising. The opportunity to delve into the metaphysical and the mystical was squandered. The film remains too mundane with an ultra weak story line. There was no development of the angels and they remain cardboard-like. The film has some merit in the exploration of sexuality but it is too myopic in scope. The best part were the interviews. They even promise better things to come. Again; nothing more than soft porn was delivered.
4,Strikingly Different,"Not a movie for everyone, very sexually explicit, parts are very erotic..just a very unique, different movie..has a good story, is photographed beautifully, resolves itself well and then there's all the sex...hard to recommend because of the fact that it is so non-mainstream..but if the above statements intrigue you, try it.."
2,s'okay,unpleasant fantasy with a sad ending. 14 more words required. 14 more words required. 14 14 more words required.more words required.
1,Porn,"Holy ships and giggles, this is straight up porn. I'm almost appalled the actresses did this film. This leaves nothing to the imagination. It is a product of male fantasy not lesbianism. Ill give the actresses, and their spouses if they have any after this, credit it takes guts and talent to do a film like this knowing millions are going to watch. Overall one star on the plot level. three stars to the actresses. I don't usually watch a film based on ratings but I wish I headed the warning of everyone else."
3,The Exterminating Angels,"I got this movie in hopes that it would be as erotic as his previous movie ""Secret Things"". To say the least, I was disappointed. It does more less give a hint to reveal what happen to the director for making that movie though."
4,Don't skimp like I did... get the deluxe version.,"Print Shop has been a fine product ever since the days of the Apple II, and this version is no exception. All the tools you need for just about any project are here, from professional-looking business cards and letterhead to report covers or greeting cards for any occasion. Plus, the software is bundled with a well-written manual (unlike many competing products), but the interface is so intuitive you'll probably never need it.So why not five stars? First, the system requirements... your old store-bought Win95 Pentium just won't cut it, at least not without a memory upgrade and an extra gig of disk space (but this is something of a testament to the program's capabilities). The real problem with this version is the clip art: you would think 140,000 images would be plenty, but I find very few useful ones on my two CDs. Do yourself a favor and get the Deluxe or Pro version to get the most out of this fine product."
5,Soundjam MP,"The program, Soundjam MP Plus, is an incredible program which allows you to easily download the names of all tracks on your CD, turn all audio tracks into the hot new MP3 format, as well as the ability to create and manage your own personalized play lists, based on the music that you like to hear. Soundjam MP Plus also allows the user to download and utilize custom created ""skins"", which alter the appereance of the players display and controls. This program is a must buy for music fanatics and casual listeners alike."
3,Too wierd,"This is a concert from the complete group from the Radio Gnome Trilogy, including Steve Hillage and Tim Blake.Gong was probably the best space rock band in history (I don't consider Pink Floyd to be space rock). During the Radio Gnome days, the band had an amazing line up of musicians.But, the music on this album is just too spacy, eerie and wierd. While driving down to LA at 3am, I had to turn it off because the first 17 minutes were giving my wife the creeps.The problem with the music is that is all mushed together and incoherent. There are a number of solos on this album, but you really can't enjoy them becuase they are muted by a ""wall of sound"". For instance, you never really get to hear Steve Hillage breakout. There is a short flute solo, but the sax is never highlighted.I think I would choose any other Gong live album over this one. But a number of the Gong live albums end up sounding alike. If you want to get something truly different and spacy, this is the one."
3,"Fine Book - Can't Look at It, though","Its been covered that its a good Quantum problems book, but I really can't read it. I knew it was old, but it looks like it was done on a type-writer. Can't fault them though, Caveat Emptor."
4,Nonstick cupcake form,"Great quality, however the size of cupcakes is very small - about 2-3 bites. Good for parties - not everyone may want a big cupcake."
5,You DO get what you pay for ...,"... and in this case, it's DEFINITELY worth it! This Calphalon pan is sturdy and absolutely non-stick. I've made mini orange-cranberry muffins (sweet - sugar usually causes things to stick, but not these), corn muffins (less sweet, but still can stick in a lesser quality pan -- not with this one), and hors d'oeuvres ""shells"" using round wonton wrappers that I baked and filled with crab salad. Absolutely NO sticking on anything so far.No warping, either -- a real problem with my old 24-cup mini-muffin pan. This is a heavy-duty pan.Yes, it's more expensive, but I figure this will outlast ANY of the other pans available. I consider it a good investment."
2,Stuck!,"I have been using this pan for a couple of weeks now, with mixed results. Brownie bites have been sticking a bit, even if sprayed with Bakers' Secret, but I had better luck with pecan tassies. Unfortunately, today I decided to try mini frittatas. Even after oiling the pan generously, the frittatas stuck so firmly that the pan has been soaking for 4 hours now and the thin egg crusts are still attached and even resist scraping with a spoon.Definitely not worth the hassle. I will have to search for a different pan."
3,Works good but you'll need some bandaids.,"Just got it in the mail today. Works well and doesn't leak at the faucet, however, it took me four bandaids on one hand & two on the other to patch myself up after removing after use. I'm still going to use it because it serves it's purpose. I'll just have to use a towel to take it off the faucet when I'm done watering my plants."
2,Not deep enough to attach to faucet,"I have a Moen pull-out spray faucet and I need to attach a garden hose to it. The aerator on the faucet unscrews and it looks like this adaptor ahould fit instead, but the threaded part of the adaptor isn't deep enough to reach the threads inside the sprayer. There's a raised lip that prevents the adaptor from fitting into the threads."
2,Leaky and Sharp!,"The product attached to my sink without incident, but when I attached the hose to the other end and tried it out the connection was leaky. To top it all off, the adapter got stuck in the end of the hose. After cutting my hand and destroying the adapter trying to remove it from the hose, all I can do is go to the hardware store tomorrow and buy a new hose connector, repair the hose, and find a better faucet adapter."
5,Great,"Fits perfect, no problem installing it and it attaches to the hose I bought. So now I can was the inside of high rise apartment windows without hanging out of the window."
2,didn't fit!,"It is the exact same size as my faucet! Doesn't go inside or outside. So disappointed, because I wanted to bathe my dogs outside in nice warm water. Noticed that none of those advertised have any measurements. I thought it was some sort of universal size. Would have liked to know the sizes. Can't send it back, because somebody threw away the box and invoice. Probably wouldn't be worth the shipping anyway. Guess I should have considered the size issue before ordering.. Was shipped super fast and packaged nicely, though!"
4,great for hanging dishtowels and such out of sight,"This fits nicely inside a kitchen cabinet door (though we needed to mount it on a piece of wood rather than on the cabinet door directly otherwise the cabinet door wood would split) and is useful for hanging dishtowels, rubber gloves, and dishwashing brushes etc to dry and be out of sight. In order to hang a veggie brush on one of the hooks, we pinched the hook so the hole in the brush handle would not slip off the hook, and voila--it worked."
5,Just what I was looking for,Perfect little towel rack for the kitchen. Holds many items and it's just the right size. No complaints at all.
2,Not the best available,"This performance. featuring the ""dream cast"" for this opera falls far short of expectations. The best overall is actually James King who sings the music much better than expected at that point in his career. The most irritatinbg thing about this performance is the fact that it is running a whole half-step high, which really makes things sound more frenetic than they are. Rysanek is not at her best and is clearly vocally exhausted by the finale. Ludwig has some real problems with the tessatura at this point in her career and barely makes it to the end of the performance, ducking the last high C altogether. My suggestion is to find the magnificent 1964 Salzburg recording with Von Karajan, Rysanek, Thomas, Ludwig, Berry, Hoffman, Wunderlich, and Popp. Now that is a dream cast!"
5,A Book for Birds in My back Yard,I chose this rating for this book because it shows a moredetailed feature of the make up of the birds structure andwhat to look for.I like the full coloring and explanations of the birds.I would recomend this to students and family's wantingto share learning about birds in and around their home.
2,monotone,"This album is supposed to invoke a nightmarish vision of, well, 'polygon' (: futuristic, dehumanized) cities.Believe me, it doesn't.Apparently, Robert Henke is a little doubtful himself about his evocative powers, because on some tracks, he lets vocoded voices of the train station variety offer descriptions of the cityscape you should be seeing in your mind's eye. Spine-chilling stuff... if Doctor Who is your idea of spine chilling stuff.Apart from that, there's no music worthy of the name. Just an hour of low-frequency drones with the occasional bleep or bloink, over state-of-the-art digital rhythms showing a remarkable similarity with battery operated beat boxes from the early eighties.That's pretty much it, really.Save your money, leave some coins in your pants and listen to your washing machine."
5,Hair raising and gripping,"I was lent this book by a friend and could not put it down, so I bought my own copy. It is exciting even if sometimes unbelievable but you do get a feel for a Museum trying to get a certain piece for its collection. The cross is amazing and I suggest if you are in NYC to take a trip to the Cloisters to see the cross, examine it and wonder at the workmanship; the pictures in the book don't do it justice. Besides, there are other gorgeous items at the Cloisters, not to mention the view and the building. Read the book and then go to the Cloisters."
1,Don't waste your time!,"After reading one book by Judith Kelman, I thought I would give her a second chance and try another. I didn't possibly think that another could be as bad as the first. I was wrong. Where Shadows Fall is an insult to suspenseful romantic mystery readers everywhere. To start, the relationship between the two major characters in the book is developed hastily and unbelievably. The murder or suicide plot is weak at best and everything surrounding it is just words on a page. Laboring through this leads to a ridiculous ending that arrived 338 pages too late."
2,does hold shape...TOO WELL,"Just like the descriptio says...this product does hold its shape. However I have had the substrate in my Leopard Gecko's cage for over 2 months and he has not begun to burrow. I have felt the substrate and it feels far to hard for him to burrow in. I did take the liberty to make my own burrows for him and left a good section for him to burrow in, but nothing. I prepared the clay just as the package says. I think that this is great if you want your reptile to live on rock. I, personally am going to switch back to using play sand as I did before."
4,Thought-provoking,"Adam Phillips writing is extremely thought-provoking, though a little more academic than I'd expected. Also, another reviewer has written that a more than fundamental knowledge of Freud's philosophies are important before tackling Mr. Phillips' text. I agree. It's been fifteen years since I've read Freud, so the memory was a little rusty.From someone who never reads philosophy, this really held my interest. Time well spent..."
2,not for general readers,"It should be a good book for a person who has psychology or related background but not for a person who doesn't have the background. The writing is little bit annoying. Most of time, I was lost in the long, unnecessarily complicate wording."
5,A firm hold,"The Jockey 3D-Seamfree low rise briefs are on the pricy side but they are well worth the cost. They fit snug and hold firmly so you feel secure all day. They have a excellent form fitting pouch providing the right support for the right parts whatever the mood happens to be. No matter what the activity, they stay in place and do not pinch or creep to where they don't belong. Fast drying so you don't have to worry about them coming from the drier still damp. Unfortunately there is not a large selection of colors, but in white, I suppose they can be dyed any color you want."
2,All That Matters,"Elizabeth Katherine Tate, better known as Honey, has returned to her place of birth, New Orleans. Now her mother is gone, and Honey wants to reclaim her old home and her place in New Orleans society. At a masked ball given in her honor, she meets the mystery man, Stephen Turner, who comes from a prominent family of attorneys. They begin dating and soon proclaim their love for one another. However, there is mystery surrounding a beautiful young woman Honey befriends by the name of Jacqueline, who is the daughter of now deceased well-known ""courtesan"" Madeline. Though set in current times, many of the terms, mores, and dialogue were geared more for a century ago, or even the early 1800's. The pretensions of the so-called aristocrats seemed forced and false. Mst of the characters were caricatures of themselves. Unfortunately the story just didn't jell."
1,A waste of time,"This book focused on the Creole society of New Orleans. Unfortuntely, the characters seemed to be stock characters at best. I could never get a feel of the characters, therefore, I could not get into the story, nor sympathize w/their situations. The problems that they faced were more appropriate for the 1800's than the year 2000. The romance between Honey and Stephen felt forced and stiff. I just did not enjoy this book at all."
2,"It has all the words, and it's free.","I decided to read some of Lindsay's work after reading a piece on Slate about this lost progenitor of the Beat Poets. Heh, progenitor. See what happens when you read poetry? Your vocabulary gets all aggressive. The reviewer of the first (free) Lindsay collection I downloaded, ""Congo"" gave it one star because there were no poems in the book, only the intro to each poem. So I wasn't surprised to see that despite including the actual poems this time, there was no formatting to them. If you actually want to read the work as the author intended, this is not the volume to try. If you want to just try out the order they're in, and guess at pacing and rhythm, be my guest. I'm deleting it from my Kindle Fire, and considering retyping it in myself and putting it up.Or I could buy one that costs money. That could work too."
4,Grill comments,"This grill works great. The only problem is it's size , four people are about max. I knew this when I purchased it but due to to storage problems could not purchase anything larger.The smaller size does make eating more intimate and fun"
3,"a good, solid read","George Forell has done a very good job with the nicene creed. It is a lively, interesting and readable job. A small book but packed with information. He is of the Lutheran persuasion but that does not override the information and ideas that he presents. Enjoyed it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,Wilson Castaway Volleyball,"Picture of product is not as shipped. Should contain the black plastic piece (used to pump air into the ball) but it is not included. Makes his face look a little off, with just a hole there where the black plastic piece should be."
5,too cool,"My son asked for this as a christmas gift. Who would have thought, but it was a hit when he opened the gift. Anyone who is a fan of Castaway will appreciate this special volleyball."
5,**** Wwwwiiillllssonnnn !!!! ****,"WELL, AFTER I SPOTTED ""WILSON, THE CASTAWAY VOLLEYBALL"" AND STOPPED ROLLING ROUND THE FLOOR,lmao, I ORDERED THREE OF THEM. WHAT A BRILLIANT GIFT. I'VE STORED THEM AWAY FOR XMAS PRESENTS BUT I KNOW I'M PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TO ORDER A FEW MORE, OTHERWISE THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME XMAS DAY BATTLES OVER WHO GETS WILSON lol. AN AWESOME PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE AND VERY QUICK DELIVERY."
5,Excellent,"It's just an awesome ball. My visitors didn't even think about seeing Wilson in real life and now they have the opportunity to do it and it is a success!Only thing is that is ""nose"" isn't in the right place, but is a minor thing to a excellent ball."
3,was going to buy it,I was planning on buying this because i thought it was a great novelty gift for a great price so ia dded it to my wishlist until i had the money to buy it...one week later and its almost double the price!!! cant buy it anymore
5,Co(wow)boy Junkies(!),"Co(wow)boy Junkies(!) Great value. This band is so dear to me! Thank you for such a wonderful find! Great product, great price, great service. Caryn (&Joe) in Carmichael."
5,Storm and Jasmine-SPOILERS,"Favorite scene with Jasmine-Going to Storm's room after dinner.Favorite scene with Storm-Fight with a ""friend"" about Jasmine.Together-Jasmine telling Storm she can't leave with him."
4,Seasons Ignite,"I finally found my funny vampires and devils. An unexpected delight are the centaurs and Pegasus, plus the usual funny witches and Santas. I loved the section on reindeer; you have 4 good choices. A wonderful book for the seasonal characters and beyond. Another hit by C. Hart."
1,Be Careful...this is a paperback...not hardcover!!,"If you are purchasing this book from Amazon, be forewarned...for thirty four dollars you are receiving a paperback book. The title says both paperback and hardcover...they have not updated the site since I complained.The book is gorgeous, and I agree with the other reviewer this is an amazing coffee table book...if it were hardcover."
3,THE SUPERBEINGS,Very interesting information in this book and how it relates to Christianity. Seems like new age information. Take with a grain of salt.
1,Disappointing,"Purports to combine science and religion, but appears to have little understanding of the nature of scientific logic and a narrow view of religion. As George Bernard Shaw said, ""Beware of the man whose God is in the skies."""
1,very new age humanism - terrible book!,"This guy seems to me to be pretty smarmy. He goes farther than humanism -- telling readers that they are God, and suggesting that there is no need to avoid evil. I find his concepts to be harmful and deceitful. But he throws in just enough Bible to make it look good."
1,dangerous,"Actually, I'd rather give this book 0 stars, but Amazon doesn't offer that option.This book in my opinion falls into the category of blasphemy of the Holy Spirit. I would urge Christians to stay away. It is full of lies, and tells us, among many other things, not to resist evil."
5,Changed my life...,"I'm only 20 years old. But this actually made me change all my friends and my life. You know how every day is diferent? I mean one day is good, then the next day sucks? Well, after I read this book, every day since then has been good. And I mean more than good. It's like every day is a miracle. 1 week after a copy was given to me, I went back on this, and ordered 5 more copies to give to my friends. I wish I read this a long time ago."
4,China Sea--A Page Turner!,"David Poyer continues to deliver sea stories that have realism, believability, and foundation in fact, yet completely engage the reader in multiple, concurrent high seas dramas with events twisting and turning every which way! This pre-Gulf War novel kept me on the edge!China Sea continues to refine and enhance the image and character of LCDR Dan Lenson. He is junior for this command, but appropriate, given the story line. Dan is stretched to his personal limits and demonstrates unswerving dedication to duty and following orders. Even though the 'orders' were unclear to begin with Dan quarterbacked a difficult mission under unusual circumstances. I can't wait for Dan's role to be played out in the Gulf War!"
2,tedious,"I've read all of Poyer's other naval novels and enjoyed them. However, this one was tedious. The plot was ridiculous -- hanging men from the yard arms -- ho ho ho and a bottle of rum! Give me a break."
2,Once again Lt. Cmdr. Lenson is surrounded by dregs,"While Desert Storm is being prepared, Lt. Commander Lenson gets his shot at a command billet. A short one preparing the Frigate, USS GADDIS, for delivery to the Pakistan Navy. But a series of verbal commands, and strange reassignments leaves the Lenson and the GADDIS partially manned with a crew of castoffs and no logistical support in the North China Sea attempting to intercept modern day pirates that have bigger guns and better crews. - A bizarre plot line, within a lousy 'environment'. Once again Poyer has portrayed the 'modern Navy' as rife with murderers, mutineers, and incompetantants, including the main character. I don't understand why I keep buying the Dan Lenson books, the writing is good but Poyer's population of Navy personnel is something from a 60's antiwar flower child that thinks all military personnel are the dregs of society."
2,Not a Clancy alternative,"I am constantly on the hunt for a writer that will fill in the gap left behind when clancy decided to write jaw-dislodgingly boring books, and Poyer's not it. I am halfway through China sea now and I have to force myself to keep going. Other reviewers have complimented him for his ""poetic"" writing, and compared to some of the semi-illiterates seen in this genre, they have a point. But this heroic effort to use beautiful imagery is constantly punctured, as when the main character, Dan Lenson, is at the railing at the end of the day. The sun hanged ""like a blood-filled condom"" over the sea.......Dostojevsky he's not.Anyway, to sum it up, it's mildly boring but there's worse to be had.C."
1,Doesn't work,"This unit drains my ipod in about an hour. Drains it completely dead, I tried it twice. Also, despite item description, this unit has no S-video or audio/video outputs at all. Even if it worked, it's too complicated to use the alarm function on a daily basis - needs much refinement."
5,review,I love all of the Hillerman's books. I am so sorry that Tony Hillerman is no longer with us because I miss Chee and Leaphorn.
5,"Grim, Gritty and Creepy Shadow Book!","This is a great book with excellent art by Michael W.Kaluta.It's starts out as a sweeping Shadow adventure with seriouscharacter development. Once you get to the Nazi stuff,things get creepy and sadist. There is a good back storyinvolving the main title and you will see why it is calledHitler's Astrologer. I mainly purchase this for the artwork only and the pulp hero called The Shadow. It servesmy purpose on that level. Great Art!"
5,Spell Binding,"This book is a great balance of art and story-telling. Plus, a lot of low life Nazis get the everlovin' bejezus walloped outta them by everyone's favorite anti-hero...the Shadow.Great addition to series."
5,Great under counter lamp.,"Bought one of these for under a workbench. Plugs into a power strip on the bench. Mounts easily with two screws, and provides adequate light to the shelf which was always in a shadow. Doesn't take much room. Has a low profile. I wound up buying a second one for under a desk. They're really good lamps."
4,Great toy for little boys!,This is a great toy for little ones. My son had one like this and it was his favorite toy for years! I recently bought this for my 2yr old nephew and he liked it right away as well. It is very life like and makes great trash truck noises that the kids seem to love. I would recommend this over other similar trash trucks that I've seem at other places.
3,Just OK,This is super cute & resembles a real trash truck which is what liked most. My only real complaint is the price. I don't mind paying $40 for a truck...if only it were a little bigger & more durable :-)
2,$30?? REALLY???,"Let me start by saying this is a really cute toy. It makes real sounds & has a little piece of ""garbage"" that you dump in the truck. That being said, the garbage was lost the 1st night, the noises are obnoxious, it is pretty small & is plastic. My son loves it though & it is well worth the price I spent on it. I am trying to find another one for my nephew who has not let it out of his hands since he arrived today. But it is NOT worth the price it is listed for on here. I'm not sure what is with Amazon sellers lately, but they are becoming ridiculously overpriced. The new ebay. I got this truck at Kohl's where the original price was $15.99. And anybody who shops at Kohl's knows their toys are way overpriced there to begin with. They were having a sale & I got it for under $11. Well worth it. Not at all worth nearly $30. Save your money & go get a garbage truck 5x the size from toys r us or walmart. If you can find this between $10-$15, go for it. I think you'll be happy!"
5,You can get these for $10-$15.....,"This is a great toy, but you can get them at Kohl's for $10 right now....the price seems a little ridiculous on here. Just an FYI."
4,trash truck,I got this trash truck for my grandson and he plays with it allot. I would recomend it to anyone who has small children and grandchildren.
5,It's great,"The previous reviewer thought the backlight was too bright but it has three settings so I have not found that to be a problem. The radio is clear and the phone quality is excellent. The contrast on the caller id can be set for easy reading at a glance, even without my glasses. I also like that I can turn off the ringer on the phone. The delivery from Amazon was quick. And I got free shipping. All in all I'm very pleased."
1,Cheap Quality Unit,"This is one of those units that had potential but I guess when you build it in China and get it for less than $30, you get what you pay for.Pros:1. Compact unit/phone clock/radio2. Can set two seperate alarmsCons:1. Screen lighting is too bright--no way to adjust the intensity lighting.2. Unit allows you to adjust screen contrast using 5 settings but if you try to change it (more/less contrast), the text on the screen becomes pretty much unreadable/useless.3. Manual fine-tunning for radio stations is difficult.4. No automatic radio tuning! You can get this feature in those cheap $3 miniture/pocket radios.4. Radio reception is very poor. This unit doesn't pick up many local radio stations even if those stations are the main ones in town."
2,"Good concept, poor execution...","Well, somebody had a good idea but I get the impression that the same product managers that brought us the Pontiac Aztek worked on this one.The good:-Small footprint - it fits on my tiny nightstand-Radio is clear with reasonably strong signal-2 alarms-battery backupThe bad:-The display is as bad as everyone says. Somebody in China or at GE needs their eyes examined.-Phone is hard to grasp, especially when you're bleary eyed.-Battery backup does not remember radio tuned locationThe ugly:-The stupid flashing blue light when the alarm (radio or buzzer) goes off.The sad thing is, this was about the best corded unit I could find on Amazon."
3,GE Alarm Clock with Telephone,"I like the small size and convenience of the combined telephone and alarm clock. The caller ID is good. The downside would be the red button that continually blinks if you don't delete the record of every past call. I can sleep through anything so it doesn't bother me a lot, but it does bother my husband. Also, you can increase the contrast of the display, but increasing it makes it totally unreadable. The button to turn the alarm off is also a little inconvenient. With a few minor changes this would be a great item."
4,Nice Phone,"Very nice phone for the bedroom. We wanted a corded phone in case the power went out, I had an older GE Bedroom phone but this one has more features such as caller ID and a better screen. The only thing my older GE B.R. phone had that this one does not is the ability to turn ringer off for a certain amount of hours than come back on ( do not disturb feature). I like how the base of this phone feels weighted and it does not slide around when you pick up the phone from a dead sleep, it stays still. I paid approx $32.00 on Amazon.com. I am glad I bought it."
4,clock radio phone,After having had a clock radio for 15 years we wanted a new look and this phone gave us the look we wanted. It blends with any decor. The radio could be better quality but all the features met our needs for the price. Overall would recommend.
1,GE alarm clock,The only thing I need to point out about this alarm clock/phone is that is to bright at night time. I do not recommend this phone for this reason.
2,Poor Product,"Well, we can send people to the moon but we can't create a corded phone/alarm clock that works. Where to start?First of all, when speaking on the phone, you can here the radio station in your ear. Fortunately, the individual on the other end of the line cannont. This just seems crazy to me.Second, the FM band essentially does not work. It receives the same station for about 50% of the dial range, again, this seems crazy. The AM band works ok but the unit has questionable reception strength.Third, the display light is very bright but now I am just getting picky.I rated this two stars because it essentially technically does what I ask, which is be a clock radio with a phone. Do not expect anything above and beyond these features. This product functions, but on life support."
2,Night Light,"This is just what I wanted with clock and radio together, but the light is very bright and if I had known that would have gone with a different brand."
4,I like it,I like this product. It does have a few flaws such as the bright light and the crazy high pitched squeaking noise that occurs when you are hanging up the phone. But....I normally just put something infront of the light at night so I can sleep and I wait till the other person has hung up so that they don't go temporarily deaf from the high pitched squeaking noise.I love that it has a dual alarm feature and that the volume can be turned up pretty loud when your favorite song comes on. It also is a great space saver.The two features I would add to this handy device is a dimmer light and a cd player. And if the squeaking noise would go away this phone/alarm clock would be perfect.
2,It works but!!!,"The radio works good, the phone part is just OK! The caller ID call back is confusing the sound quality of the phone is poor, unfortunately.. and the backlight of the LCD clock is really too bright for a bedroom. I had wished at night it would only light up if you tapped it or something.. I have to cover the face so the light doesn't distrub me.. I like my room dark."
2,Bad FM Reception,"While I was impressed with the overall design of the phone, I was disappointed to discover that it had very poor FM reception & no place to attach an external antenna to improve that condition! Very disappointing, given the attention to detail otherwise."
3,Excellent service...just ok product,The vendor service was great. I find the product only ok as the backlight doesn't give enought contrast until its' turned all the way up.To get the phone out of the cradle is clumsy and tends to fall out of your hand.
4,It works for your office as well,"I have been searching for a phone that I can use for my home office that also saves me money. I already have another GE phone, so I didn't want to break the bank with my new phone. This phone is not only affordable, but does everything I want to accomplish in a phone. I am not too much into eye candy features. The caller ID, call waiting feature was a big one for me. I also like the compact design, and the backlight was a nice bonus. If you are looking for a phone that gets the job done, you should consider this one."
1,Clock Died After One Year,"After six months the clock started going haywire whenever the 9V backup battery was installed. Now the clock has stopped working completely after 11 months.This is not the first newer ""inexpensive"" alarm clock I've had do this. My 15 year old clock is still keeping perfect time but two replacements for my wife's clock have died in less than a year."
2,Nice size unit but can't see the time!,"I like the small footprint of the unit, but the lighting of the clock is poorly configured so it is either too dim to see the time, or too bright at night and disturbs my sleep. Not an auto setting clock for synchronizing with satellite like newer models and the zero on key pad doesn't always work for keying in digital responses via the phone. Overall, disappointing to say the least."
2,To bright,"Seemed like just what I wanted to save space on my bedside table--Took it back the next day. The backlit display, even at lowest level, was way too bright. Worse, there is an annoying caller ID indicator on the front that blinks red whenever you have a new call, regardless of whether you answered on another phone or not. Before you go to sleep you have to delete the entire the caller ID list or watch a blinking red light all night. I doubt anyone at GE actually used this thing before putting it on the market."
1,GE Should Be Ashamed!,"Looks good but a waste of money! The display is completely unreadable at any setting and after one frustrating hour of trying to program I packed it up and returned it. The manual is clear, but unfortunately the product doesn't respond. It does look good, and would be acceptable if the display weren't so poor. I had no trouble with radio reception as others indicated. Do not waste your time and money on this item!GE Alarm Clock Radio Bedroom Phone"
5,Piano Duo -- Toni and Rosi Grunschlag,"Absolutely stupendous! I have heard them in concert, and they are phenomenal! They are also wonderful ladies whom I admire greatly."
5,Pure joy with the Grunschlag sisters,"This recording is sheer joy. To listen thereto relaxes every care and carries the listener to another world. Thank you, ladies!"
1,Bad,"it was totally horrible, i want to chuck this cd out a window after pissing on it and repeatedly soaking it in lighter fluid and setting it on fire, but not before i rub it in a large quantity of cow pies."
4,Bought it used...,"Cute book, very popular with my French Immersion primary students, but I bought it used and it already had some pages folded back. Its design makes that happen easily. Still, my students really like it."
3,interesting,"I think that this game was very poorly made, but the concept was very innovative, so if you really like this genre of games, then run and order it today! But if you think that graphics and sound effects are an important feature of computer games, then I would not suggest this graphically inferior game. Hope I helped you."
3,Disappointing,"I agree with the authors' basic premise that it's possible to happily retire at an earlier age and with less income. However, I was disappointed with the way they assume everyone reading this book has a spouse, is debt-free, has a middle to upper-income salary and will never have serious health problems. They ignore realities such as: 1) the Canadian Pension Plan is based on earnings/contributions so the lower your salary, the less pension you will receive. 2) Eating healthy and getting regular exercise does not mean you won't won't get a long-term illness (e.g., Alzheimer's or Parkinson's Disease)that requires an expensive nursing home. 3) Owning a mortgage-free home and/or a loan-free car doesn't mean you don't have maintenance and insurance costs.I'm still in favour of retiring early, but it's not quite as simple as these authors suggest."
5,book,"Why Swim with the Sharks? An Unconventional Guide to Early RetirementVery pleased with this purchase. Book was hard to find, glad to find it here. Arrived in terrific condition."
2,Wine gums ( real ones),"This disc contains an interesting mix of early LPD material.When I first heard this set I was very disappointed as this was my first LPD disc and I had heard so much about them.At the time it seemed to me to be amateurish and badly recorded( and very obviously Eighties style music..never my favourite decade).However..something about it kept drawing me back and I have really come to like this disc a lot.I would not recommend this as a first LPD disc( how about Crushed Velvet Apocalypse...)but it certainly has merit...and will find a place in the collection of every true fan of the band.Favourite tracks..well obviously ""Premonition 1 & 2"" (these seem so much more advanced than some of the other tracks here,and I am a fan of the series) ,""Splash"" ( I know the feeling) and ""The Whore of Babylon"" .All in all this is a very good collection,but not the place to start."
2,gorgeous but killer on your feet!!,"these are as stunning as they appear in the photo but man did they do a number on my feet. my foot is a true 7.5M and that's what i bought but they fit more like a narrow. i live in high heels so i never expected pillows under my feet but these are exceptionally uncomfortable... i've never had to get shoes stretched before this so i went down to my local shoe store and invested $12 more in these shoes. also, the elastic in the back that sits at the ankle is VERY tight... now that my foot fits into the shoe i can wear them but still have to wear band-aids on my achilles tendons every time to preserve my skin! besides all this, the workmanship is pretty shoddy (the leather upper is actually glued to the platform and it's noticeable even at 2 feet distance... kind of a bummer bcs i wanted to wear these in style). certainly not worth a penny more than $40. but i have to say, they ARE pretty hot, if you can stand the pain."
1,I was very disappointed.,"The majority of the recipes require quite a number of extra ingredients, some of which you may not have in the house. As well, there was a lot of prep time involved with many recipes. Basically this is a book of recipes that you add ramen to, not a ramen recipe book. Most of the time you won't be saving time or money."
5,101 Things to Do with Ramen Noodles,Received this item in a timely manner and am anxious to give to our daughter for birthday....she LOVES Ramen Noodles!
3,Good Service ....,"The seller provided great service, but the book wasn't all that amazon advertized, great basic, but not amazing for those of us who have worked with the noodles before."
2,Recipes Unimaginative or Bizzare,"I have tried a few recipes involving ramen noodles that were really great, so when I saw this book and the reviews, I thought this would contain 101 great recipes. However, for having so many recipes, I found this book to be rather unimaginative. Many of the recipes involved tacking on ramen noodles to traditional recipes, or substituting ramen for another kind of noodle. More still seemed to be similar with slight variations or even just bland combinations of ramen with different kinds of canned soup. I don't need a recipe book for that! Any attempt at being creative seemed like strange, unappetizing concoctions. Simple, or ""basic"" as other reviewers have mentioned, does not have to be so boring."
4,Ok. But not as good as I expected.,"I love ramen noodles & I'm always looking for new ways to eat them. I eat them once a day almost. This book has a few recipes that are very good, but most of them remind me of a campbells soup cookbook. I just was not that impressed. There are a couple of other ramen cookbooks out there that are supposed to be pretty good? I'll get them from the library first before I spend my money on another."
4,Great Gift,I bought this as a gift for my husband who absolutely LOVES Ramon Noodles. He thought it was a clever gift idea and actually made one of the receipes that night!
5,Noodles R Us',"I book is okay when it come to cooking in the ""college"" setting. Used the book more then I though I would.-NachoBell"
2,Ramen non-delights,"I was very disapointed with this book - give it to my college son and he and roommates tried many and thought they were awful. Of course, what can you expect of ramen noodles? My fault for the cholce I guess."
2,"Too ""basic""",I saw the author being interviewed on the Food Channel and thought the book might be a bit of a kick.This is for a REALLY beginning cook. (Which is what it claims to be.)Too basic for me.
3,How could a student in a dorm use this? They can't.,"Thought this would work for a friend's daughter going off to college... but the recipes call for things to be sauteed and baked, and for that matter, the book demands the user have a pantry of some sort. Not really very useful for college students in a dorm setting, but maybe for non-dorm students? or for grads just going out into the world and living on a shoestring... I would never eat most of this stuff, but i could see my son -- who's not terribly into food OR cooking but who loves Ramen noodles -- using it when he's living on his own in the future."
3,101 things to do wtih ramen noodles,The book was smaller than I expected and the recipes were not as good as I had hoped they would be.
4,101 Things To DO With Ramen Noodles,There are a lot of easy recepies in this book. I got it for my step-son who is always to worn out from his job to do much cooking.
5,Yay Ramen!,I love ramen noodles and this is the perfect cook book! From the full meal recipes right down to the recipe for trail mix.
1,Won't be using it again...,"I just finished a Modern Physics course using this book and was not happy with it at all. The exposition is less than clear in many places and the problem set is sub-standard in my opinion. Some sections were so poor that I found myself searching through other texts for a better treatment of the subject. That was when I stumbled upon a 1981 version of ""Concepts of Modern Physics"" by Arthur Beiser. To my dismay, Thornton's text seems to be a cheap knock-off of this much older (and better) text. Or, perhaps it's just a case of most Modern Physics texts being very similar. All I know is I won't be using this text again."
5,awesome book,I bought this book for my dad who is also the father of a Junior A hockey player in Montana. He LOVES this book- quotes from it and laughs so hard he can barely talk. Highly recommend this one!
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I am a hockey lover, I follow college and semi-pro hockey. I have read numerous hockey books but this was not a standout by any means."
5,One of best sports books I ever read,"The great thing about this crazy book is that you don't have to be a hockey fan to like it. My sport is baseball, but this Goon was so interesting and funny, you can't help but laugh along with him and his strange journey."
5,Money well spent-GOON,"I have to disagree with the last review from ""Hanover"" who thought this book was ""not worth the money"". I have read numerous hockey books and this one is a jewel. There are no books to my knowledge that give such an in depth look at the lifestyle of a minor leaguer who is literally fighting for his job every game. GOON has opened my eyes to the pressures and dedication it takes to successfully achieve a dream that nobody feels you can.Last reviewer; being from the hometown of the author, its sounds as though you have a personal issue with him...were you one of his victims on the ponds ??"
5,"Buy it, you'll like it!","If you like hockey fights and fighters, buy this book, Doug takes you along for the ride of your life. I've reat The Hammmer and Tiger's book but this one is by far the best."
5,LOVE IT! LOVE IT!!,I had a Hoover Futura for about 16 years and it just broke. I wanted something similiar to that because I loved it so much.This model is not a disappointment at all. It is so great.I like how I can clean the hard floors with the one attachment. It is so handy!I also really like the feature where the cord gets stored inside the vacuum and I have to just push a button for the cord to go in. Truly a great product!!
4,Great Vacuum,Product is very light and mobile. It has good power for its size and has all the tools you need. No problems at all.
4,Satisfied customer,"A great vacuum, especially for the price. Very compact and well-designed, it handled more like a European vacuum cleaner than a clunky old American model. I have both hardwood floors and area carpets and am very satisfied with the performance of this model, I am not even using half the attachments that are included. You could easily spend lots more money, but for 150 bucks, this Hoover will do the trick."
2,Windtunnel vaccium,"I like the vaccium, but the handle was defected, and I was unable to get help how to get it replaced. I spent 30 mins trying to figure out how to contact someone. So I probably won't shop for something this way again. There should be some kind of help phone number so that I could have talked to a live person. I still am using a defected handle and it doesn't seen right, but because there is no store to return it to I stuck. So I don't like this at all."
3,It could be more user friendly!!,"This is the second canister vacuum that I have. It is good, light weight compare to Kenmore, but the handel and attachment could be a pain to remove and install. Specially, the electrical cord for the brush head is very dificult to plug in. Of course, Kenmore brand would cost three time this brand, so it should design better."
2,Vacuum power only good thing about this machine,"This vacuum has excellent power for cleaning. However, the cord winder broke in less then a year and the nub on the hard floor brush that is used to connect it to the wand broke shortly after that."
1,not good with high rugs,"Very very poor vacuum for high rugs... had to replace it with a bissell that did a much better job (still loving the bissell by the way..). after using the hoover twice, it started to lose suction and spit the dust and everything else right back out. was such a pain...."
1,Motor burned out,"I bought a hoover windtunnel cannister vacuum less than 3 ywers ago. The motor burned out. I only use it at home. Since my husband is in the military and we moved, I was unable to bring it to my point of sale. The hoover customer service was not helpful. I will never buy a hoover product again."
5,Just what I wanted,"My old Hoover canister of 20+ years bit the dust. I found this Hoover online and it has surpassed my expectations. I mainly want it for vinyl and hard wood floors, plus car and boat carpets. It is extremely light weight - compared to what I had! I can even carry this one up the stairs. It does well on the hand tools too, like the upholstery attachment. I have a good upright for the carpets, but this is perfect for everything else."
3,sucks the dirt into the motor instead of the bag/Turbo 5000 model,"Loved it for about one year. I considered it the best vacuum I have ever owned. Noticed one day it was getting hot, and it blew my circuit breakers .Seems now the dirt and dust it picks up does not go into the bag but into the motor! I use the proper S type bags. I have cleaned out the entire inside of the canister and washed the filter cover of the motor each time it happened as I thought perhaps I was not attaching the bag properly. However, there is really only one way to attach it in order for the canister top to close.I may bring it back to Macy's as they are pretty reputable. I am hoping it is something simple that can be resolved. Curious if anyone else has had this problem"
2,Send this vac BACK!,"I've found customer reviews very helpful in weeding out lemons. Too bad, I didn't read the ones on this product before I wasted $300. The carpet attachment sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. The retractable hose stopped working, so I've been winding it around my arm and tying it with a plastic tie. The last and most serious problems is with dust coming out of the bags and covering the interior. After washing the entire interior, replacing filters and bags, the same thing happened over and over. It's history and I will never buy another Hoover. I gave it two stars because it's a nice blue color."
3,plastic not durable,"I have owned the S3630 for 3 years. Performance is OK. BUT shortly after I got it the plastic handle clip broke, then the headlight bulb went and I couldn't find a replcement in any store. Next the 2 small wheels on the motorized power head kept falling off (they seem to just clip into the plastic and won't stay put). Also if you try to buy replacements for the dust filters, you're out of luck,unless you special order from Hoover and who needs the hassle? It cleans well on the whole. I do find that dog hair tends to cling (thro. static) to the body and power head and is hard to remove. It's a pricey disappointment!"
2,Plastic broke,"Bad design on the plastic cover to hold all the accessories in --it looks like they were going for looks rather than practicality.The suction is OK, 12 amps just like my previous Eureka upgright. I guess not much has changed in 5 yearsThe storage position is a little weird since the assembled wands hook onto the canister. You always need two hands to move this thing around.Again, if it weren't for the cheap plastic cover, this might be OK, but I can't recommend it. If I paid list of $369 for it, I would definitely return it. Fortunately, I paid $179.99 - $30 off and a $20 coupon from Amazon, making it a $130 vacuum shipped to my door. Still I would say it is only worth $99."
1,"Run, don't walk, away from this stinker!!","What a dissapointment! This vacuum was good for about two weeks, now the rubber belt has stretched and it will not spin the brush-bar. The hose from the cannister to the wand attachment is too short, so I am constantly hauling the cannister towards me. Also if you want to vacuum blinds, you have to lift the entire cannister off the floor with your other hand - not convenient. The bag is small and requires replacement often. It is easy to move from carpet to bare floor, but all the other problems make this a poor choice. Too bad, my twenty-year-old hoover worked better. This one is headed to the landfill."
5,A phenomenal vacuum at a fair price,"I recently purchased this vacuum after having used one that my mother purchased, and I have never been more satisfied with a vacuum cleaner. The canister is light and easy to carry as you go (it also has wheels), the cleaning head is very effective, and the cord is plenty long.The standard attachments I don't use that often, but the windtunnel head is just fabulous for cleaning upholstry and other cloth articles not normally vacuumable. The whirly brushes get jammed sometimes, but don't they always.In short, this is a very versatile and powerful vacuum, in a small package at a very good price. Highly recommended."
5,"I say 5 stars, my husband says 4","Why I give it 5 stars: 1) It's much quieter than the ancient thing we stopped patching and finally tossed; 2) it's lighter--I can haul it about without further injuring my shoulder; 3) the upholstery attachment works GREAT on pet hair; 4) the crevice tool is flat enough to fit in the narrow slots of cast iron radiators; 5) it slides all the way under the bed; 6) great suction.Why my husband subtracts a star: 1) The only off-on control is on the cannister, and it's very easy at first to confuse it with the cord retractor button; 2) the upholstery attachment sits in a plastic bubble that rides on top of the cannister, and which needs little provocation to come unhooked; 3) watch out for that great suction around the fringe on the good oriental rugs."
1,piece of junk,"When I had this vacuum less that a month the plastic cover broke off. Then, a wheel fell off. Then the plastic piece that holds the wand to the canister broke off. Now the motor has burned out. This vacuum doesn't even get a lot of use, since I also have another one on another floor. This was a huge waste of money and I'll never buy another Hoover again!"
5,great vacuum,Great vacuum few things I did not like putting plug into wand I put a little white nail polish on both ends so you know how it goes in also marked the foot and cord switch so I know which one is what. Other wise I love this vacuum my other hoover is seven years old the new one is so quite.
3,old but works,"I was surprised to see when this vacuum arrived that it was EXACTLY the same as the model I had purchased years ago that had died. No changes, upgrades, modernizations of any kind at all. I also felt as if this vac itself might be pretty old. It came in a faded and battered box with shredded and broken styrofoam.But it works fine so I can't complain."
1,don' bother with this one,"I purchased this vaccuum because the reviews were so good and I wanted a canister vac. Well- the attachment for rug cleaning is a pain to put on and change when you have to go back and forth from rug to floors. And it doesn't work that well, I can't push it forward so I have to pick it up and then drag it backwards on the rug. So, no I use the floor attachment on the rugs because it's easier but doesn't have much suction power on rugs. And the whole thing isn't quite as light as I expected for tugging around the house.Big disappointment!"
4,Vacuum Review,"Recommended product by professional cleaner. Prompt delivery , very good price. Works as predicted. Highly recommended cannister vacuum"
3,my first canister,"This is my first canister vacuum.I also have an upright but with tile and wood floors on the first level, a canister was recommended. It was a little confuding to put it togeteher. What ever happened to appliances already assembled? anyway, it is very lightweight and therefore, a little difficult to control. It seems to do a good job with the floors and rugs and self adjusts. As for its longeviety, it is so light that I feel it won't last very long. Oh, where are the vacuums of yesteryear??"
4,hoover s3639 windtunnel canister vacuum cleaner,"vacuum sucks great, the edge cleaner on the power head stinks. I love all the attachments but they could be a little bigger and the place to put all the attachments is a little cheezy. This vacuum is worth what I paid for and it sucks as well as the higher priced ones."
2,"Great suction, but plastic construction sucks, too!","I have owned this machine for 2 years. As the title says, it cleans well. However, it is poorly constructedout of a lot of plastic. I am NOT hard on appliances and yet I've had to make extensive repairs on the bodyof this machine to keep it operating. Thank God for duct tape as that is the only way I'm able to keep thehose connected to the body as the point of connection in the plastic top simply broke out from standard use. I've also had to use tape on the small wheels on the carpet nozzle to keep them in. I would not buy another Hoover product after this due to the total lack of structural integrity."
2,Very Disappointing,"I've owned this vacuum for less than a year.While the performance and cleaning power are very good, the poor quality construction and refusal of Hoover to repair these issues overshadow the positives.In the past 6 months the cord rewind has performed sporadically, the bag level indicator has frozen in one position, the cord to the powerhead has frayed, the wheel under the power nozzle has fallen off ($5.00 to replace after a 30 minute drive to the closest repair facility) and the power nozzle headlight cover disappeared.After dropping it off for repair (and being advised that parts take 1 month to be delivered) I got a call from the repair shop that the main housing is cracked, which causes vacuum suction to be reduced, and this is a $50.00 repair not covered under warranty.Bottom line: Spend your money elsewhere, this company is a disgrace"
2,Not impressed!,"I have always used the Kenmore canister which always does a great job buteveryone of them that I have had ended up with a crack by the front wheel on the bottom of the vacuum. For this reason I decided to try another vacuum. The Hoover advertised a power hand tool. It is not. It works on air and if you push down too hard it stops spinning. I can't seem to get the vacuum to its full suction power. The bag never completely expands. The tools are also a pain to get on and off. I don't even bother with therug power head. I use my upright. I can't stand plugging and unpluggingthis! Overall, stay with Kenmore. Much better quality."
4,Very Happy Deliveres What Promissed,"Very impressed with the suction, and the filtration. Love the way you can turn the roller brush on/off with a easy to use handle switch. I have always been a canistor user and found the Hoover to exceed my needs. You can use either filtration or regular replacement bags. It's peace of mind to know that Hooverremains the only manufacturer of Vacuums Cleaners in the US that have their own Factory Repair Centers and great service after the sale. They are also located in the Internet. Try finding that when you buy a Fantum or Regina. I did and they're a joke."
2,Not real hapy,"The Hoover Wind Tunnel vaccuum is not very user friendly and has design issues:1. The extension handle has to be unplugged to use small attachments.2. The extension lock should be a quick snap and not have to hold the metal snap up.3. The cannister does not move freely. Needs to be directed by pulling.4. The hose gets tangled and does not swivel well.5. The small beater attachment is useless.On the positive side, this product does have good suction.Had I seen this product in a store I would not have purchased it.G. Zaborsky"
4,Windtunnel,"It is a very powerful vacuum for the price, but somewhat heavy and bulky to use. This has resulted in my wife turning over the vacuuming to me. Not what I intended. A good buy for the price however."
2,Breaks too easily,"I bought this vacuum based on it being a consumer reports ""best buy"". Unfortunately, after only using it for about a year, and I don't even vacuum as often as I should, it is falling apart. First the motorized floor nozzle broke where it attaches to the hose, now the power cord no longer rewinds all the way. Yes, it worked pretty well, but it's too cheaply made and falls apart."
5,Hoover Vacuum Cleaner,"The product arrived in super record time, within a few days infact. The product met my expectations and the price was excellent."
4,great value,Hoover S3639 WindTunnel Canister Vacuum CleanerThis was a purchase to replace another hoover canister vacuum that was showing its age after 10 years of service. This vacuum works great. It has more power than the older model and more attachments including a small power head attachment for the staircase. It was a great value from Amazon. Very please with its performance and highly recommend it.
3,OK,Vacuum performs fairly well. A little hard to maneuver and the accessories lid refuses to stay on but it does clean the rugs well.
2,Too bulky,Unfortunately I had to return this vacuum. The head is so big it wouldn't fit around furnture. I had to move everything out of the way and then back again. I'm going to look for something smaller.
4,I'm Happy !!!,"I am pleased with my new Hoover Canister Vacuum. After, our old canister vacuum burned out unexpectedly. I wanted another canister style, after using them for several years. I decided on Hoover, instead of going back to my previous brand. Now, that I have experienced using my new Hoover canister, I am glad I chose it over my old brand.This vacuum works nicely on hardwood floors. It glides right along, without the need to pull it sharply, as required by my previous canister vacuum.It is impressive on carpets as well. It has powerful suction. It leaves the carpets clean and with that new carpet look. Overall, I am very satisfied with my new Hoover Vacuum. I am confident I will have many more years of reliable service from this vacuum cleaner."
2,Barely Adequate,"It's a good thing this vacuum is cheap because that's what you get - a cheap vacuum. The collection bag is small (get used to replacing it often), the canister doesn't roll freely behind you (get used to tugging it), the return spring for the power cord is barely able to do the job (get used to helping it back in), and the power head wants to jump out of your hand when the brush is spinning (get used to fighting it).On the plus side, the thing is inexpensive and has a good selection of attachments, but it's not enough to overcome the many negatives. Save yourself the aggravation and disappointment and buy something better."
5,I LOVE this book.,I think this is the best book in the Night World series.I like the way Maggie uses her brains to get out of trouble. And well atleast she didnt kill every vampire in sight like Rashel did.
2,Spare me!,"Now..don't get me wrong. I have nothing against L.J Smith. Look at her following! She is apparently a very smart business woman who knows how to sell sub-standard books. Night World took her away from a few trilogies that were excellent fluff, into a pattern so predictable, I could write these myself! Sure...soulmate principle. Cute..I like it. But when every person meets their soulmate, I just have to say ""yeah right!"". Other things come to mind, that no matter what, all the girls are instantly found devestatingly attractive to the gorgeous hot-shot vampires. *Just Once!* I would like to see something that wasn't so tired and predictable. How about having a vampire..oh, I don't know, actually kill someone innocent? Or not find their soulmate. I don't know..I really have enjoyed Smith's books..but this is getting very very old."
2,"I didn't like this Book, I can't believe L.J. Smith wrote th","I really didn't belive that this book was written by Smith, L. J. she wrote some really good books like soaulmate and Daughters of Darkness, but this one was unreal. I hope she comes out with some better ones, I lived most of the other ones but this one is on the bottom of my list."
3,I couldn't believe that she wrote this!,"I can't believe this book was written by L.J. Smith. With all her other wonderful books in the Night World series, I expected this to top all the others. It took 136 pages just to get to the point of the story. There was too little info about to make the story come together. And never did it mention in Spellbinder that Aradia was blind. Never. This book disappointed me as an avid L.J. Smith reader, but I still can't wait for the next book to come out."
4,Black Dawn:what i thought.,I think that this book was very well wrighten and exighting. If you are a fan of the other night world books you would enjoy it. I think the characters are cool and as usual i was sitting on the edge of my seat going hit him hes dangeros dont fall for him. But that might just be me. Some of the characters in the book are quite commical and as usual the Redferns are involved in the plot. But this book also has something about the witches in it. I found that this book keept me guesing to the very last page on some thing or another and i really enjoyed it. I would say that Black Dawn is one of the best night world books.
5,One of her best,"As a reader who has read this seiries as well as the Dark Visions and the Forbidden game series, I can say that anyone who is a L.J. Smith fan is sure to love this book. It has romance that is not over the top mushy, and Smith incorporates real feeling into believable characters in a story that is sure to hold your attention until you have finished reading and even after you're done. I highly reccomend this book."
3,Helpful but not essential,"This book was helpful, and the stories were relevant, but I have found personal experiences and those of others in the business to be much more practical in training sessions."
3,too large,"received earlier than when promised. attractive boot.leather stiffer than I like, boot was too large - ran wide - so had to return."
4,Best book on 1864 Valley Campaign,"This is the best book on the Valley Campaign of 1864 and features lots of research on the 4 battles that occured during the campaign. The book is well-written, but I found that it could be dry at times. However, this is still a very good book. One of the best points about this book is Wert's analysis of Sheridan's and Early's generalship. Wert gives well-reasoned and sound conclusions on the analysis of the two generals. The book also features a terrific chapter on John Mosby and his Rangers role in the campaign and features a pretty good look at the role the campaign played in Lincoln's 1864 reelection campaign. All in all a very good book, but due to the amount of detail and research perhaps only Civil War and history buffs will enjoy this book."
4,Freaking awesome knife.,"Looks alone make it stand out. It opens VERY smoothly, closes easily, extremely sharp. Have had it months, remains sharp, no problems opening after all this time. Clip is also strong. I love this pocket knife."
2,Sloppy Lock Up,The blade on the unit I got had way too much side to side play. Was charged shipping anyway on the return.
3,Gnarly garlicky !,"Well, awfully crunchy. Maybe too, for some things, and it doesn't seem to soften much with time. It's still a presence in my handmade Russian Dressing - 4 days in. Seems to impart good flavor, and undertones. But the ad said it would be great in pasta salads. I don't think so. Too hard to chew, if you get more than one. Interesting flavor rather offsets texture. Would I order more ? Not at this price !"
1,Hunks of Garlic,"I love garlic, however, I did not like the taste of biting into a re-hydrated piece of this roasted garlic. I used it to make soup and have thrown the bag of ""Just Roasted Garlic"" away. If you like the taste of fresh garlic (sauteed or roasted), I would not recommend this product."
1,They sell as Blu-Ray but are actually normal DVDs,"I purchased this product as it clearly stated it was in BD format but when it arrived, they are normal Region 1 DVDs. I paid courier for this so returning is not reasonable so I'm stuck with these."
5,"It's love, and I've found it!",Judith Shatin is an amazing composer. She is a really important teacher at UVA and so I think you should all listen to her. Sometimes when the flute is playing at the same time as the violin my ears hurt but otherwise its really pretty and i almost see pictures in my head if i think about it really hard. I love music and most of all I love Judy Shatin!B. Purvis
1,I want to punch this guy in the face,"This guy is a blatant Nick Drake rip-off artist, and a poor one at that...I thought this was a generic stock song farted out by a band that made commercial jingles (so Sprint could have Nick Drake's sound w/o having to pay royalties)...I can't believe this is an actual ""recording artist"""
3,"Pretty Solid, Not as good as reviewers are saying it is","This is a pretty solid album and Alexi has a very cool chilled out style. My favorite track is ""Dream About Flying"". It almost kind of reminds my of the John Butler trio a bit. I think he sounds a little like Nick Drake as far as some of the guitar arrangements however I think he has his own thing going on. I also disagree with the Jose Gonzalez comparison in the review, I believe they are clearly different artists. Gonzalez has much more of a spanish style classical guitar approach. Overall I would say this album is a good purchase. Some of the songs kind of blend together in my opinion and I'm not sure it's as good as some of the reviewers are making it out to be though."
2,"CD has defect, Orange Sky song is listed, but is not on the CD","Love the music, know the songs, but found on the Time Without Consequence CD that the last song listed on the CD: Orange Sky for 6:11 minutes is actually Towards the Sun for 4:41 minutes (in its place) and there is no Orange Sky song on the CD at all. I already have Towards the Sun (song) on another CD, so I am disappointed that I paid the $14+ for 11 songs, and then didn't get one of them. I am trying to find a way to complain to the record company and have sent an email to management@aleximurdoch.com. [One month later:]There has been no response."
5,"Finally, the full album - worth the wait","Alexi Murdoch stands out amongst today's up and coming singer songwriters. With songs like Breathe, Orange Sky and A Song for You, Murdoch is setting the tone in today's folk scene. The way he melds his vocals and guitar is reminiscent of Nick Drake and some of Cat Stevens' acoustic music. But he is really his own thing. If you ever get a chance to see him live, it is well worth it - like the wait for this full length CD."
2,Poor Excuse for A Quotation Book,"If you are considering this book as a resource to search for quotations on a given subject, leave that fantasy behind. Quotation books are often subjective in how they are organized and this one is no exception. However, this book of quotes will leave you wondering ""What were the editors thinking!"" The organiztion and inclusion of many quotes are questionable at best. Examples could be found on the heading Laziness:'He has a head that is for rent unfurnnished,' anon. Is this laziness or an example of the elevator that does not go to the top floor, a basket two sandwiches shy of a picnic, or essentially an empty headed person?'The lazy man gets round the sun as quickly as the busy one, Wombat, and 'The lazy are always wanting to do something,' Vauvenargues. While these quotes could have use for a reference to laziness, they beg for the punchline that brings home the concept of laziness. They could also be useful under a different catagorization."
2,Book Two: Life Outside of Four Bee,"""Drinking Sapphire Wine"" isn't as good as the first book in this series, basically because the protagonist is stranded in the middle of nowhere with nothing going on except creating a new Garden of Eve while trying to keep out straying desert creatures (similar to the ones in the Unicorn series) and Jang at the same time. I think this sequel really put a damper on the whole storyline. That's mainly why I gave it a 2 / 5 score.I would certainly recommend the first book (""Don't Bite the Sun"") over this one. But if you liked this book, then I would recommend the combined edition of these two novellas: ""Biting the Sun"".If you're looking for a really good sci fi novel, though, then I would highly recommend ""The Silver Metal Lover"" by the same author, which is one of the best books I have ever read."
5,Fantastic!,Nice feel to keys. Nice to have cordless - often more convenient than having a keypad on my laptop because I can reach it even when I'm working on my bed.
4,important black voting scholar produces book,"Bositis is considered the leading academic on African-American voting behavior. As important as the CBC is, I'm glad to see an analysis of their work out there. Nowadays, this book may seem dated. Still, if you want to know about black politics and black elected officials as a group, this is a good selection to peep. Bravo, Bositis!"
3,Stories about growing up Southern that will touch your heart,"Herron has captured the experience of growing up in white Southern culture in the 1950's and 60's. As the foreword states, ""This is a book of stories about values."" And indeed it is. He writes in a way that calls up images or memories of World War II and patriotism, small town life and farm work, being a boy and growing in faith, so that our own reflections are stirred, whether or not we share his exact recollections. He weaves his faith story through the narrative in a way that draws out the best of what Christianity offers, and challenges the errors of the church of the last half of this century.This is a book that will make a great gift, especially for baby boomers' parents who can really identify with Herron's soul stories, or for anyone who likes stories of how character develops. Herron has allowed us a glimpse of his own character formation. Consequently, more than his own sons benefit from the effort."
5,Best tool for diagonal patterns,This tool made the job so easy. I would recommend to any one laying a diagonal pattern for marking the cuts against the wall. Great product.
1,Junk!,What a waste of money... Over priced Ruler!!! Tool is junk and so is the company that sells it... Just try to get Tile Right to honor anything... Good Luck!!!
5,TileRight Measure,Been using it on a difficult project. This is my first tile project so I bought everything I needed. I checked out the video on you tube and decided to buy. Its worth every penny!
5,6 stars,this is one of my favorite series when it come to anime im at I'm done with all and are waiting for seasong 9 so much Cant wait.
4,Drip Clips,"Chose this little sink over others because it stated in came with 25 BLUE Clips. They came with silver slips that are square at the bottom and triangular at the top. When shopping on the internet it is very important that what you see is what you get...The sink itself is cute, the size shown is accurate. Should look cute on desk."
1,Bitter,"I love a good latte' - which was why I purchased this Syrup (as well as, the Pumpkin Spice Syrup) - I have always used the Gourmet ""Sauce,"" but decided to give this a try, big mistake! I found it to be bitter and the flavor was harsh, even when dispensing less than a 1/2 of tsp. To say that I am disappointed would be putting it mildly. I haven't tried using either of these syrups in baked goods, so I am unable to comment on that particular aspect. However, if you are searching for a product to put in coffee to make your favorite hot or cold drink, I recommend purchasing the sauce not the syrup, it is well worth the difference in cost. The sauce is thicker, has a full bodied, authentic flavor and mixes well with hot or cold beverages."
4,"Patricia Cupido-The O.C. The complete seasons1-3 received twice, ordered once.","I was pleased with my original order. The problem started when I received another of the same order in the mail days later. I went on line to review my account and it showed only one order ordered of the OC. I didn't appreciate having my credit card billed twice and having to go through all the hasstle of figuring out what to do with this additional order. I have sent it back and registered on line to Amazon that it is returned. I am not sure if I will be able to count on Amazon again. I was pleased in the past, but this second shipment of the OC was over $100.00. That is a big mistake. I sent the second OC back with the return label from your web site, be sure to re-imburse my American Express asap.Thanks"
3,"Buy the First Season, Rent the Second Season, Forget about the Third Season...",I rate The O.C.: The Complete First Season 5 stars. I rate The O.C.: The Complete Second Season 3 stars. I rate The O.C.: The Complete Third Season 1 star. I'm sorry but this show has gone downhill. I don't think that it will make a comeback during the fourth season. It already lost its audience and it is very hard to bring them back. I'm predicting that it will get cancelled during this fourth season...
5,"Love it, Love it, Love it!",Furby is a great toy/gift. Infact I was playing with mine an hour ago. It is super fun!
3,Fun At First,"When you first get this toy, it is a lot of fun to see the things that it can do, but this is fairly short-lived as the limitations of the toys actions become apparent when you can't handle hearing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star one more time, and your sick to death of playing redlight/greenlight. It is adorable and has a sweet little voice, but you can easily loose interest quickly when you run out of commands for Furby, or it smart's off at you and tells you ""No"" everytime you tell it to do something. If any of you have kids, you probably hear enough of this already, and don't need any help teaching the kids to respond with ""No"" when you ask them to do something."
3,Great gift,"I'm kinda wishing I bought more of the old furby's. I know I'm definitely going to buy more than 1 of these. Great gift for this year for about anyone. I can see that this isn't just for kids, adults have kids in them, too!"
2,Mine won't do anything,"My husband and I were excited to get this for our 2 little daughters (5,1.5) But we can't get it to do anything. We've all tried the commands and all it does is ask if we want to be friends. And yes we turned it from the 'try me' switch to the 'on' switch. It seems like we are the only ones having trouble so I can't say it's a bad product. Maybe it needs new batteries. Anyway it seems to have potential."
1,Excessively frustrating,"Don't waste your money on this. It was fun for a few minutes, but is extremely frustrating for a child who wants something more interactive.The commercials are misleading about the amount of interaction that actually can occur with this toy. Very limited play possibilities with this one."
4,"Released on VHS, but DVD?????","As of this date, Sept. 13, 2006, I'm not sure this has been officially released on DVD (seen at Amazon for $125 on a DVD release!). I've got it on VHS (paid $5). That said...A Gunfight is a good western, but not quite a classic. The story is striking: two friendly gun fighters agree to duel to the death that one of two might rake in a lot of dough for shooting the other. Cash puts on a marvelous performance, and makes you wish he had acted more regularly. I like the film immensely--can't wait for it to really come out on DVD!"
2,very good music but audio is terrible,"this is one of the most underrated donizetti's opera but despite the good quality of music the audio si very noise, full of high and low disturbs, others 1955-56 operas that I heard are more listneable"
3,Not for Everyone -- but don't ignore it!,"First off, the sound is not quite so bad as two fellow reviewers say here. It certainly is not good -- but, compared with some other Opera d'Oro recordings, it rates fairly well. In a word: don't be put off from discovering this VERY obscure Donizetti opera by those comments. At this very low Od'O price, with a more than acceptable cast and a good conductor, give this a listen. It's a far cry from LUCIA -- but various sections grab the ear and the listener's attention."
2,Not a diamond in the rough,"OK folks, I never write reviews for these things, but Amazon is sort of pushing this video, and given the positive reviews, I felt I had to chime in with some sobriety. I'm sorry to say this is not a great movie. At most it is a slightly clever, low budget entertainment - sort of on par with a strong student film. I don't mean that with disrespect, just being honest. The high ratings it's gotten here are pretty inflated, imho. The scenario is preposterous, which could accelerate wonderfully into fabulous campiness, but the film never leaves the ground. Acting is a bit uneven and the script isn't strong. Unless you are friends with someone in the film or someone who made it, this probably won't rank high on your list of favorites. Too bad. I was looking forward to a diamond in the rough, but this ain't it."
3,Amber,"OK... this is hokey, but entertaining. Kept me watching and the end surprised me. I think it was worth the watch, maybe."
2,Mediocre,"I didn't know quite what to expect but it was included in Prime so I figured I didn't have much to lose. Good thing. I would have been disappointed had I actually rented it. The story line has possibilities galore for a good psychological suspense film but it never delivers. The characters are stereotypical and over the top - so plastic that it's hard to identify with any of them. The move from three sisters who can't seem to stand each other, to three who are now 'bonded' by this experience (in less than two days time) is very hard to believe, and the over the top use of the F-word is hard to understand. Quite honestly, if it wasn't for the 5,000 uses of that swear word it would have been a least passable. For most of the movie I thought I was watching an old Richard Pryor routine. Good idea. Decent premise. But it needed a much better script and much better acting."
5,Am going to buy it now,"The best way to describe this movie is that it's somewhere in between a dark comedy and one quirky ass mystery. The 3 main characters are sisters who've never met each other, and who all happened to be named Amber. They are each messed up in their own special way, and I really can't say I had a favorite. The 3 of them were all awesome and you'll quickly become engaged in the relationship that forming between the three. Can't say much about their shrink of a dad without giving anything away so see for yourself. I'm not the most enthusiastic person in the world, but here!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not Worth Renting,"Any movie that depends on the ""f"" word for every other word is not worth watching. This movie is all about three girls swearing all the time, acting badly, and their father acting patient and understanding through all of their behavior. I did not finish watching it."
5,actually available elsewhere...,"look on amazon for number B004V0B81U Kitty Wells Johnnie Wright Final Tour (VHS) and you should find it! it's only on vhs but there are several copies, including one new! cheers! good luck!"
1,EXTREMELY SCARY,This thing is goddamn freaky... It looked cute online but when I opened the box I soiled myself!
3,Interesting concept of the afterlife,"I thought Peck's version of what the afterlife might be like was very original, and interesting. However, I only gave it three stars because the writing did not seem very ""inspired"". It was written from the perspective of someone who is analytical and not very emotional about his experiences. There were a few parts that I felt were a little awkward, namely the part where Satan gets involved, but even so I still think the book is worth a read. If you are are more interested in the concept then you are in the writing style, I would recommend this book. It's a very quick read."
5,Keep on purchasing,I've bought this book multiple times to share with colleagues and friends. It is quite thought provoking and well written.
1,"Great performance, defective bluray disc","A very disappointing experience. To make a long story short, the disc hangs at the beginning of chapter 5 (4th movement) and will not continue. Received a refund notice which is a good thing (thanks Amazon) but I was looking forward to the complete Mahler/Abbado/Lucerne cycle for it's uniqueness in concert history but alas, it looks like a blu ray ""Resurrection"" from these forces is not in the cards."
3,"Troll - ""eh"".","I give Troll and ""eh"" rating.It is a so-so fantasy story about a boy, named Harry Potter Jr., no less (played by Noah Hathaway) who discovers his sister is possessed by an evil troll (hence the movie's name).June Lockhart shows up as a good witch who swears a lot, Sonny Bono plays a victim who is turned into an elf.The Lord of the Rings it ain't!"
5,Outstanding writing and story,"The characters are so well developed and the story so well told that this book is hard to put down. You feel as if you are walking with Alice and Siegfried as they tour their grape yards and you feel their anguish at how to stay afloat if the rumored ""Prohibition"" is passed. The romantic story is well presented, but not over done. I throughly enjoyed the book and was amazed and how quickly I read through it. I look forward to reading future books by Michaela August."
3,interesting story,"i don't read very much. i read this for a college course. it is not painful to finish at all. in fact, in comparison to other college related materials, it is quite fun because it tells a story, which also tells something about the time period of french revolution. so probably a good read for many of you out there."
4,Marygrace,"It was easy to set up, I love the finish on the wood. It isn't a five star for me because the chairs aren't comfortable in the least. But I love the look of it.Great durability."
2,Not the best,I have a boston terrier that needs his ears cleaned oftern. These pads were ok. I found that they were not as moist as other brands which made cleaning his ears more difficult.
5,Great set,Bought this set for my mother's living room. Very sturdy and easy to assemble. Dog loves to stretch out underneath the cocktail table and it is easy to see where he is hiding out.
2,Not for sale,"This is not made of wrought iron, I complained and was reimbursed. But was also promised the listing would be updated to clarify it is NOT "" wrought iron """
4,Very Comprehensive,"I am taking the test this weekend, so I guess then I will really see what type of guide this is. Overall it's a great guide for those who have experience and learned the math at one point. But like me its been a really long time since I had a real class.This is not for someone who is learning the concepts for the first time. Maybe a few things you missed here and there (Matrices, Permutations, etc..) But not for major concepts (Algebra, Functions, Calculus, Trig).Lessons have plenty of examples with a verity of different problems. Also has great exercises and a full length test at the end. Also has several chapters discussing Mathematics teaching. Which you don't want to forget about, that's part of the test too!"
3,Serves it's purpose for those with a math background,"Some of the examples and concepts do not have adequate explanation. Definitely will not get you through the exam if you have not had math through the Calculus level. Also, there were actually a few errors in their solutions."
2,Too many typos,"The book is of limited value to someone trying to recall mathematics learned and is fuzzy on the details. There are too many typographical errors which means the book is actually giving out wrong information! If you're not really sure of what you know, the book doesn't help you review but steers you wrong."
1,Lots of errors and hard-to-follow explanations,"I'm sorry I bought this book. It's filled with errors, the explanations are not clear and it doesn't teach specifically to the test. I shelved this one and bought the XAM FTCE Mathematics 6-12 study guide and like that one way better.The XAM book goes over the topics that will be on the test one by one and the explanations were a lot easier to follow. I took the exam today and passed! I also highly recommend Purple Math and Khan Academy as great free sources for learning and review. Good luck!"
2,Numerous erros in formulas,"First, I have used 3 different study guides from this publisher. In general, these guides overly prepare you, which isn't necessary bad, but be prepared to delve deeper (and longer) into review than you really need to. In addition, there are numerous errors in math formulas used to the point where I would not use this guide as a source for memorizing any formulas, of which the Calculus section is often wrong in the formulas presented."
4,Shows that Clinton isn't the only pol with a few skeletons,"Authors Hilton and Testa chronicle numerious allegations of misconduct and misbehavior of a variety of political figures. In a bi-partisan way they clearly demonstrate that Clinton is not alone when it comes to allegations relating to sexual misconduct and other abuses.From rumors of children born out of wedlock and cases of sexual harrassment, to helping friends and supporters gain special favors from the government, this book is a must-read for anyone interested in ""official Washington."" If the old cliche ""You can't tell the players without a scorecard"" is true, here's the scorecard."
4,Refreshing view of people protecting my morals.,"I am surprised that the number of reviews and discussion about this book is so limited. Why aren't there more? I know why. Everyone is afraid of being sued. I believe the message in this book leads to realistically removing the garments of hypocracy. I find this book a collection of facts and opinions fascinating. I can do without the psychological comments. The profiles illustrate the unprincipaled devices used by those thatare charged to ""protect"" us. I feel that these peole should be exposed.Potentially, they represent a serious threat to the average citizen. Though not all the transgressions are monumentally serious, I believe that our protectors need to be carefully monitored. If ignored, we will lose our freedom in small, continous assaults by greedy and power-hungry special interests"
1,Just the type of junk you expect from Larry Flynt.,"From a bunch of hypocrites who claim that the ""politics of personal destruction"" is ruining American politics, this piece of trash is just another salvo in the war to protect Clinton and his cronies from their crimes."
2,Flimsy Design Consider the Lutron 3-gang,"The plastic looks and feels flimsy. For around the same prince you can get theLutron SC-3-SW Claro Three-gang Wallplate Snowwhich is easier to install, much sturdier and looks much nicer."
2,Better ones available,"This is a simple item but I returned it because I disliked the true shape is not rounded square and all along the edges were the ""imprint"" left over of the plastic molding (I don't know the technical term for this). I reordered the Cooper Wiring brand of screw less plate covers and they are much more satisfactory."
2,Poor design,"Allow me to add another issue with all of these screwless wall plates. Unless you have an inventory of fairly new switches, these screwless plates will not work with any switches using the pre-decora hole spacing. With decora, wall plates are available to handle the older spacing. With the screwless plates, its new spacing or none.I was ready to purchase over 80 wall plates before I realized I had expensive fan switches, catv, ethernet and phone jacks that these switch plates could not mount to. I don't mind replacing catv/phone type stuff but replacing high quality fan switches is expensive.The install is a also a bit of a pain. Fortunately I got as far as buying one plate to see what it was all about and that was the end of that project."
4,A Collection of Thoughts truly a delightful collection!,"Only Major John Wooden, the Master Storyteller, could write and compose such insightful, captivating, eloquent, and a revealing collection of beautifully crafted stories. Mr. Wooden collection of stories, poetry, brief inserts of history, and biblical principals launches the reader on an exciting journey down a vast variety of fascinating paths: life, love, laughter and sorrow. Mr. Wooden Collection of Thoughts is a well-vested addition to your personal library.Janice Teddleton, PresidentNorth Texas Chapter of Blacks In Government..."
1,Therapeutic Exercise for Athletic Injuries,This book was never sent to me as I was told the postage was too much and my money was refunded. I was not happy.
3,BEAUTIFUL PHOTO SHOPS,The picture was beatiful but it is in French with no subtitles so I returned it.I recomand it for those who understand French.
4,"Good, but a little cut up","For the price, this was a good buy. It has a lot of great guests, but I think they could have used some more Ed mixed in for continuity."
3,The Ed Sullivan Show,"These were alright but not the best grouping of people. Not very Christmas oriented as I had hoped. Maybe it is my memory that's bad, but thought there was much better shows than this collection highlighted."
3,"Not bad, but not great",I loved the Ed Sullivan show growing up so I was really looking forward to this DVD. I don't think the clips that are included were the best ones they could have put on this type of a DVD.
5,A wonderfull trip through time,This approx. 45 minute video makes time fly bye.This is our new favorite of 2011.What a marvelous time we used to live in.Buy it watch and enjoy.
2,Great product. Terrible paper label that will leave glue!,"It's a basic steel blade that can't be bad.The paper label that comes sticked into the blade is the bad idea. You can try to remove it, but no matter what you do, there will be glue behind, which won't come off.Great product, will definitely use again. And everytime I'll remember about the worst label and its glue."
2,Okay,"I am new to staying-at-home, and thought that this book would give me inspiration for the hard days, but I'm probably going to get rid of it. It did make me feel really guilty for not staying at home with my now 2 year old. But I wasn't really impressed with the writing style, nor with the amount of information in the book...seems like it could have been about 1/5 the length. The author kept going over the same information over and over again. Don't think I'd recommend it to anyone."
1,2 of four burnt out within one week... Don't spend the money,"I ordered these bulbs liking this style of light... However, in a box of 4 two burnt out the first week. I would give the product 0 stars if I could. Who wants to box up and return a light bulb?"
4,YES,"The Ditty Bops are all over the place. They are taking over. They are coming out with a record every year. I like it. This time they have hooked up with Mitchell Froom. Even Pete Thomas shows up on this. I am surprised The Like have joined the action. The Ditty Bops are still set in the 1940s. They have some lovely songs like ""Angel With An Attitude."" It's not like everyone is doing this sort of music. They do have a bigger range of songs on this one than the last album. They do a cover song ""Bye Bye Love"" which is great. The Ditty Bops are refreshing and ultimately inspiring."
5,Excellent Music,"The Ditty Bops are fun and there music is crisp. This recording is well done and I consider them my favorite new group, at least new to me. I heard them for the first time on Xm Cafe and became a instant fan. This is a must buy CD and rate it 5 stars."
5,This is a must have!,I first saw the Ditty Bops on LOGO and fell in love with them. Even after listening to my favorite song of theirs I still don't think my head's too big. I love their humor but most of all their music. Check them out. You won't be disappointed.
4,Cool Cultural Doc,"A film writer friend actually recommended this to me. I'm not Asian, but very much into hip-hop and have been pretty unimpressed lately about the direction it's heading. Not that this film changes that, but it gives me hope. Though it may or may not be intentional, this documentary showcases more than just Jin and his Asia tour. It highlights the emerging Asian hip-hop culture and its fledgling followers. Along with its pure newness, hip-hop's many artistic elements, which have all but died in America, unlock an expressive outlet for Asia's increasingly progressive youth. I would love to see more films like this out there."
5,The Authoritative History of Ted Williams,"This is an absolutely FABULOUS book. It details not only the career, but also the life of the greatest hitter who ever lived. I am generally not a big book reader, but I could not put this one down, reading it in a little over a day. I guarantee that if you are a baseball fan, you will love this book!"
3,More fluff than good stuff.,"The book's title should change to ""Mostly contemporary recipes using very uncommon items and just a few traditional recipes."" I was very disappointed with this book. Maybe for my personal tastes only, but when I'm looking for great German food, I'm not looking for herring with apples, pickles & horseradish, or tripe soup with morels, or jugged rabbit. I couldn't find any jägerschnitzel or parisien schnitzel that you should find in any good German restaurant. It can be difficult to find things in the index as everything is sorted by category - but not very sensical at all, instead of being just alphabetical."
5,I cook from this book all the time,"I live in Germany and experience true ""German"" cooking. In comparing this book to several other German cookbooks I own, this one is by far the best (and easiest). I am truly impressed."
2,Disappointing,Far too many contemporary off-beat german recipes & far too little traditional german recipiesIf you want good basic german recipies this cookbook is not for you.If you are tired of true traditional german cooking and want to try some off-beat ' not what you would expect from german cooking ' recipies you might like this cookbook a little
5,great very heavy duty,very heavy duty there a product witch i would deffintley buy again cant go wrong with this price
4,BEST PODS,i bought these because the picture makes them look awsomean no i did not get STD'S from them as tld by the boldest squid but i did get my gf pregnant......
2,too superficial,"I purchased this book hoping to learn more of the daily life of ancient palestine. It is true that the book makes an extensive coverage of this subject ( food and its preparation, cereals, grains... how people dressed, jewelry, family order, houses and villages, etc. ) and with plenty of photographic material (in this the book excels many others ) but nevertheless it doesn't seem sufficient, on almost each of the chapters I was left with the feeling that the book lacked of something, maybe I expected it to be more centered on how life was organized, read the temple and the palace, economy is not really covered either. The style of the writters maybe considered very easy to follow, like if you were reading a tale, this may not necessarily be bad, on the contrary, but you may end wanting it to be more like other scholar works, more ""dry"". Read carefully the index and some excerpts and decide wether it is what you are looking for or not. Hope this review may help you."
3,They're called the Dark Ages for a reason...,"...because we don't know much about them. The authors are ambitious, trying to characterize various amorphous peoples and histories. The chapters and text headings seem to suggest that the reader will find some insight into the cultures and practices of various barbarian groups. However, much of the text consists of listings of grave goods, and the pictures are the corroded armor and shields you've seen in other books before. Scanty information is no fault of the authors, but they did offer chapter titles such as ""warfare and society"" without having much to fill those chapters except for speculation and in some cases accounts of contemporaries. Which brings me to my recommendations, which is to read ""Chronicles of the Barbarians"" if you are curious about the dark ages. These are verbatum translated accounts by contemporaries writers, mostly romans. Also you might try ""the anglo-saxon chronicle"" or Beowulf."
4,Theory,It is always interesting to read current ideas on the universe and what they think is going on. I always enjoy reading Stephen Hawking because his books are not too technical and can be read by the common person.
3,Quality Ring and Nice Looking but too Thick for Small Hands,"I originally bought this to replace an extremely heavy platinum band. It's a nice looking ring but it is way too thick for my hand. I'm not complaining about the top-down view thickness (7mm), I'm referring to the thickness from the finger to the top of the ring (from the top of the inner ring to the base, where the finger slides through). It is 4mm thick.Ring Review:+ Good Quality+ Nice Looking- Too thick (for small hands)If you have small hands like I do (from base to top of the middle finger measurement = 8 inches), I do not recommend this ring."
2,"its not exact the way it looks in the picture, well my suggestion to every one is do not buy any thing by just looking @ the pic",well I was not happy when i received it b'coz it did not look the same the way they show in the picture..............buying stuff from Amazon is a big problem they dont have the direct contact number from where ever you are buying so that if for some reason you dont like it you can call them and tell them about it or you can send it back...........so may be I will stop ordering stuff from amazon I would like to talk to a live person where ever I'm getting my stuff from and their is no contact number ever and you wont know where your order is comming from
2,Broken before two years of marriage!,"I bought this ring for my husband as his wedding band. It is a beautiful ring and we both liked it a lot. Less than two years later the cable in the middle BROKE and fell out of the ring. I was under the impression that the entire band was made of titanium, but apparently the center piece is steel. This is no good for a man who works with his hands all day handling heavy packages.Now I'm in the market for a new ring. Very irritating."
4,Keep On Talkin' By Stephen Briodi,"Good album. Worth the price, for sure. New Age guitar. Vendor sent this item in a timely basis.Would recommend, if you like New Age Jazz."
4,El Demonio de la Depresion,"Un buen libro para informarte acerca las depresiones y todos sus complicaciones. las ideas suicidas, adiciones etc.. Este te da mucho que pensar y a mi en lo personal me ayudo mucho a entender la depresiones en diferente terminos."
1,deceive,"I receive a book with this stamp ""palm springs public library 300 south sunrise way palm springs, ca 92262. Important mistake not to verify what you sell."
5,Very Bad Copy,The book is excellent and a good introduction to the basis beginning of Yoga. The current offering of the book is a very bad copy of the original book and is marginal for reading. The original book was obviously copied on a copier and the pages inserted into a soft cover book. Do not buy this book.
5,Breathtaking!,This book will literally leave you breathless! I have always had a difficult time getting that whole breathing your way to enlightenment thing down...but this manual is an extensive blueprint on the how-to's of breath work. A tantalizing and inspired read.
4,Great for the beginning cook/chef :),"I bought this for a friend of mine, who was needless to say clueless about cooking and cooking techniques. I have one of these cookbooks that my mother gave me over 20 years ago. It still is as informative now as it was then. My friend loves it and it has answered so many of her basic cooking questions and some of her more ""how the heck do you do that"" type questions. This is a classic beginner and pro cookbook. Timeless info, it even has etiquette and table setting info in the back for reference!"
5,oldie but goodie,"The tandoori chicken recipe alone is out of this world. I made it years ago and my mother has raved about it ever since...the cookbook was hers to begin with.It has fancy recipes like beef wellington, but also simple ones. It has a great section on different table settings and even napkin folding techniques."
5,This is the best purse ever!,"This is a great purse. I don't like carrying big bulky bags or purses, so this is the solution I was looking for. It's plenty big enough for carrying wallet items, plus the side pocket can carry a cell phone, lipstick and gum. Perfect."
