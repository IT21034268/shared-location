2,Literature Lite,"It was a mindless, plodding book, fun, lite, good for summer at the camp if you don't want excitement and suspense. Some of the writing was ok, other parts very dull. The plot leaves much to be desired, motivations are weak. Characters are wooden and never clearly seen. At times the plot even contradicts itself. Yet, reading this is like walking through a garden looking at flowers, it's fun for a while but then you crave looking at people and eating a hearty lunch. Unfortunately this book doesn't deliver the latter two experiences."
5,The very best.,"A very lovely novel. One that I'll never forget, one that I anticipate rereading many times. A keeper."
2,A dreamy coming of age novel,The book describes a year in a young man's life as he encounters the perplexing unfolding web of three other lives in Japan in the late 1930's. The story has much to say between the lines if one ponders the issues. It creates a peaceful delicate atmosphere - very much like the garden of the title of the book. In my opinion it was poorly written in a sharp directed fashion from a young man's viewpoint lacking in poetic depth and substance. I cannot recommend the book unless you have plenty of time on your hands with the ultimate goal of reading everything that ever gets published.
5,Hard to put down,"A wonderfully written book, very fluid. Like a bonsai, this book has been crafted, not written. Enjoy for yourself, and see if you don't pass it on."
5,A Soothing Masterpiece,I did not want this book to end. I tried to read it as slowly as possible because it moved me. I loved the characters Stephan-san and Matsu-san they were two opposites when they first met and in the end they were like father and son. I finished this book two weeks ago and find myself daydreaming about the events in this book. I am hoping to read more of Gail Tsuikiyama's books.
1,Not worth the money,This item was disappointing. Previous model had digital radio tuning whereas this model reverts back to a clunky dial. Radio tuning is terrible. No stations come in. Has feature to allow you to play mp3 player through the unit which was the reason I bought it. MP3 sound quality is terrible and has a constant humming sound behind it. CD player did not work out of the box. Returned to vendor asap. Save your money and don't buy this product!
1,False Advertisement,It states it is 14oz but it only holds barely 12oz without ice. The glass is extremely heavy and uncomfortable to hold.
5,A Bargain!,"This 2 CD set containing the complete John Cale Island Records releases; together with a handful of great bonus tracks, is really a bargain.His three Island albums are all classics, each containing several Cale Classics. To mention just a few tracks from each album, I would bring out ""Buffalo Ballet"" and ""Ship of Fools"" (Fear), ""Mr Wilson"" and ""Guts"" (Slow Dazzle) and ""Cable Hougue"" and ""I Keep a Close Watch"" ( Helen of Troy)Among the bonus tracks ""All I Want is You"" and ""Bamboo Floor"" from the ""Slow Dazzle"" sessions are gems that had deserved inclusion in the first place.The 24 pages booklet with a fine essay by Ben Edmonds contains interesting recollections from the various sessions and informative notes on many tracks.Simply a great buy!"
4,4 stars as an historical piece but one item is missing!,"I have worked with John. He is a raw and unique talent who has a sensitive soul surrounded by heavy gauge barbed wire. His music reflects this. As his associate in recording and live performance, you always had to have the tape running since you never knew what would happen and you didn't want to lose it. My only regret on the listings here at amazon is that Carribean Sunset (Zee Records, 1983)is missing. It was a unique eclectic pop album that struck out in some way at Lou Reed's success ala Cale. Most notable was the love pop tune Hungry For Your Love and Modern Beirut Society complete with Israeli missle targeting commands and a rocket explosion that delivers you into the title track featuring the great background effects of Brian Eno. Does anyone have this on CD? I would like a copy!"
2,Very inconsistent,"I'm a huge fan of about three of the songs on this collection, but was very disappointed with much of the rest. I'm very familiar with Cale's VU catalog, and some of this later work, but this mid-70s period was largely a mystery to me. There's no debating Cale's talent or passion for his music, but there are about a dozen tracks on this compilation that sound like b-sides that were just added to their respective albums as an afterthought. ""Ski Patrol"" for instance is just an awful song. That said, ""Pablo Picasso"", ""Heartbreak Hotel"" and a few others are just brilliant performances."
4,For fans of Brit pop or The Jam,"The title track that starts this album is a rockin' number but not the best the album has to offer. The R+B roots can be felt throughout this album, as is the case with most Weller solo stuff I've heard. ""Up in Suze's Room"" smacks of the Jam and is a great tune with wonderful guitar. ""Heavy Soul Part II"" is a fantastic instrumental piece with also a nice, trippy electric guitar showing. Overall the album has good song writing, and if you're a fan of Weller or the Jam you won't be disappointed. ""Friday Street"" is a particularly good tune which shows of Weller's pipes. The album is definetely worth the purchase."
2,Heavy Heart,With a heavy heart I have to say Heavy Soul is Paul Weller's worst solo album to date. There is not a single song that has anywhere near the magic of his first two solo albums. The songs seem stuck in the same groove and never break beyond the mundane.The best tracks are Up In Suzes' Room and I Should Have Been There To Inspire You. Better Paul Weller recommendations are Paul Weller (1992) or Wild Wood (1993).[DW]
4,the return,"For fans of Weller's guitar playing (see: Nonstop Dancing), this album is a belated return to form. While this recording will not surpass Wildwood in the hearts of the Weller faithful, it does SOUND fantastic. The choppy, syncopated yet punctual guitar bursts make me remember that, back when Paul's voice sounded like a laryngitic daschund, he could really whack out some riffs!The lyric content is about on par with Stanley Road, which is to say... passable. Buy it for the guitar work, you won't be disappointed, and you'll have FUN listening to a Weller album for the first time in quite a while."
3,"Fantastic songs, bad production.","Lyrically, Heavy Soul is one of Paul's best albums. Production-wise, however, it's too cluttered. Brendan Lynch put too much psychedelia onto some of the songs, and it takes away from the whole product in the end. Peacock Suit is a good example of that, with those weird chirping noises. The songs aren't allowed to speak for themselves when they're being truncated by all the noise!"
3,Heavy Soul,"Having thought ""The Gift"" was the Jams' best album (and hence unlikely to bring about their disbanding), I was hoping for a similar sound in ""Heavy Soul,"" but my personal tastes wouldn't rate this as Paul's best work.It's still got great songs though, and the 1970s look to the cover sells it too."
4,Great oil medium,M Graham produces quality oil mediums for painting. It's definitely a more economical purchase than linseed oil.You also don't want to buy cooking walnut oil instead of the actual mediums for painting since they do tend to spoil faster. I find this brand great for longevity as well. Haven't had a problem and coats palettes easily and removes oil paints easily as well.
5,Fall Colors in NC,"This was a great book for us when we were in Durham NC in the '90's. My husband was building the ""Crap Shack""we so enjoyed our stay there. And tried to learn the names of all the beautiful trees and scrubs."
5,The Best of Pete,"I loved this dvd. it gives another side to the Beatles. But I always wondered why Pete got fired, until I bought this documentary. He was a real trouble maker! He got himself and Paul arrested for burning a condom. He talked John into robbing a sailor. And many many others. I guess the Beatles wanted to spend their money on sound equipment instead of bail.It's always the shy ones..."
5,"It's been a long, long, long time...","Pete Best has put together a very nice retrospective of what the early days were like. I don't think anyone will ever really know why he was kicked out of the band, just as they were about to become arguably the biggest music sensation of all time. But it seems Pete finally came to terms with his fate, and is enjoying a certain level of success in his own right.It's pointless to argue whether it was his drumming, popularity, aloofness or whatever. It is what it is and it happened. Take the journey back through time with Pete, Astrid, Klaus, Cynthia Lennon and numerous others who were there. It's not often you will get this close to the early Beatles!"
3,A Sad Story In Music,You get the feeling this guy is tired of being asked questions about being a Beatle. I re-listened to a few Hamburg recordings and he repeated himself more than Ringo and tried to grab attention (which Ringo never once did.) Over the long run it couldn't work. Too bad George Martin didn't speak. There is some new insight on Liverpool clubs but very little new about the Beatles.
3,Not bad. Not great either.,"I disagree with the folks who say this is just ""sour grapes"" - I think Best showed considerable restraint in this program. He didn't go on and on about how he got the shaft, etc. It could have been a lot worse in that department.But, the whole thing seemed amateurish to me, particularly the music. I'm guessing they couldn't use real Beatle music, but the stuff they did play was awful. Another major gripe - a number of the people interviewed were not identified.I had to laugh at one statement (that they showed at least twice) - ""you never saw the Beatles unless you saw them in Hamburg."" I forget who said it (maybe one of the unidentified), but that's absurd."
1,Not really explaining anything!,"One of those programming language books where the printed source code is used to fill the pages. The authors to not show HOW things work. It's just a collection of well documented Tcl code. Most of the example are based on the Spynergy Toolbox, which is a rather ""exotic"" toolbox for Tcl/Tk and not at all a Tcl/Tk standard. Half of the book is a Tcl/Tk introduction. But if you want to learn Tcl/Tk use Brent Welch's book. The second half is nearl ONLY Tcl source."
1,old software received that is obsolete,"old software received that is obsolete, and can work in only xp that is not currentfor today's usage and was not mentioned on the description and the costumer service of the software did not help or sent replacement for the newer version of windows 7"
3,"Good for learning math, but could we skip the propaganda?","I had to get this textbook for an online course I'm taking.I have found that the basic presentation of the concepts is very good overall, and I ""get it"", but some of the real-world examples strike me as being propagandistic (from a liberal point of view).A couple of examples would include the modeling of the Gray Wolf population (subtle inference that we humans 'r bad for reducing said population), the number of AIDS cases in the US since 1983 (which peaked at the end of the Reagan/Bush I era, hence Republicans are to blame), and also fuel economy of American cars since 1940. We big bad Americans used too much gas back in 1958, apparently. That's why it's so expensive now, I guess.Anyway, it's not bad overall, but take the examples with a grain of salt. For the really egregious examples, take them with a few shakes of salt, some lime, and a shot of tequila."
5,brand new condition,"Sells for $170 at my schools bookstore and this book included everything and in perfect crisp condition, saved a ton on a book I'll never use!"
4,pre cal book,"Worn cover, looked like it had been thrown across the room, but few marks inside and works for the class. Fast service."
5,Annoying at first but dog thinks its the BEST TOY EVAR!!,"My 100 lb Akita mix destroys all his toys. Not the dude. Loves the dude. We call it playing the song of his people and have now made up dances to the song and alternate lyrics. I found it to be pretty durable. The first one lasted about 3 months until he sang his last song, which for a dog toy that he plays with multiple times a day is a pretty good deal. Just got his second one next day delivery due to all the sadness of the first dudes passing. Think I may have to stock up.Awesome product, makes my dog super happy."
2,A Great Idea Poorly Made,"My Airedale loves Deedle Dudes and has owned four of them, including this shark. Here's the problem--each one has gone silent on her after only a few days. They always still look like new, but they just stop singing. I have to conclude that while this line of toys is wonderfully entertaining for dogs, they are, unfortunately, cheap Chinese crap that have no durability whatsoever. I hate to support such poor quality."
3,It's ok,I wouldn't recommend this toy for a dog that is a strong chewer. The music is annoying but it drives our dog crazy in a good way for him. Good size toy for a medium size dog.
4,Can't wait,"I got this for my parent's dog - haven't sent it to them yet, but I know she's going to love it...and drive them crazy!"
5,My dog loves this toy!,"My dog loves this toy! If someone steps on it and the song playes, he will run over and take it away to cuddle with it. We all hate it, becuase the song is so annoying, but the dog loves it!"
3,Lasted for only a week,"The Deedle Dude kept my 70 pound lab entertained for all about a week but then the voice box just went silent. My lab brought it to me to have me look at it but I couldn't tell why it stopped without ripping open the toy and taking all the stuffings out. Oh well, it was great for at that one week but now it's just another stuffed animal toy for my dog."
4,"Don't crowd me, taco.","I first heard some of the songs off this album,the freed weed, on a mix tape an old girlfriend made me. I think she hated my gutsor something, but I am glad she turned me onto this band, Sebadoh. These songs are reallystrange and very badly recorded, yet they are really beautiful and catchy too. Some of the best ones here are : ""i believe in fate""(apparently about a 7 yr old) and ""broken"" and ""subtle holy gift"" to name a few. But really, all these songs are really cool. Some haunting, some funny, some stupid. And ""yellow submarine"" is pretty epic, too. These songs will make a deep Impression on you, if you let them. Sort of like having a goofy older brother in handy CD format. Enjoy."
2,Good thing I didn't pay 30 bucks...,"I took the advice of the other reviews here and tried it out. I'm not quite sure what it takes to garner 5 stars, but this one doesn't cut it. I found myself skipping forward through most of the tracks on Disc 1. It doesn't take much effort to put together lounge-disco covers of 80's pop tunes, and it's just embarrassing to listen to them.I would have given it no stars at all, but the last 35 minutes of this two-disc set make up for the sad beginning. The mix gets decidedly more adventurous - once you hit the Royksopp/Akufen/Zongamin/Royksopp section of the disc, you'll be turning it up.1/3 gorgeous, 2/3 expendable = 2 starsSince Amazon doesn't offer previews of this CD, go and listen to it before buying. Too bad they don't sell the discs individually."
1,"Don't waste your time or money, AWFUL","I read at least 3 books a week and this book has to be one of the worst I have ever read. Besides the spelling errors, the plot was incredulous. A niece witnesses a murder and then must keep quiet about it or else. Give me a break. I couldn't even follow the dialogue of the first ten chapters at least. It was hard to finish this book and as a matter of fact I couldn't, it was just plain awful."
4,Lady Mistress,"Tressa Devlin is hiding from her villainous uncle in the house of a man she's never met. When Hannibal, the owner of the house, comes home, he finds a strange household set up, complete with nicknames like Miss Sweet-as-Pie (Doro), Miss Dearie-Dear (Tressa), and Mr. Wrong (Hannibal's cousin Robert). Hannibal is immediately attracted to Tressa who is so secretive it takes a while before he even knows her name. She fights her attraction to him while he first opposes and then approves his cousin's marriage to Doro. But Tressa still has secrets-- secrets that she can't tell for fear of endangering Hannibal's life. And secrets eventually catch up with everyone. A fresh writing style and intriguing characters liven up this tale."
5,History coming alive for us!,"I really enjoyed this book! Not realizing the information I was getting at the time--shortly after reading this book, my husband and I flew to Bucharest to take a Danube river cruise. We visited the Carpathian mountains with the beautiful Peles Castle and the Bran Castle talked about in the book. We listened to the stories all about the Hapsburgs entanglement with the Austrian/Romanian/Spanish dynasties. The heirs to the Romanian throne actually live in NYC and are related in the Hapsburgs. the last Queen Marie talked about in the book died in 1939--just before the Nazis envasion. It made our trip even more enjoyable to know some of the history. It helped with the smaller countries around that area and how they still feud till this day. I have loaned this book to others to read and it has helped we Americans to understand how everyone in Europe is related to someone and how they all have had conflict with each other but they come from a common lineage."
2,"great movie, poor DVD!","this is a great film about a upper class family in italy during the waning years of world war two. I will not delve to far into the plot, etc. due to the fact that this DVD seems to be a low quality dupe of the film, rather than a studio release. while it is a clean transfer the contrast is not as good as it should be. the worst factor is that on two of my three DVDs ( a sony and a philips) players the sound is NOT AUDIBLE after chapter 6. only one of my DVD players (a panasonic) can play the sound all the way through. beware. I would wait to see another release by a major sutdio before investing in a DVD of this truely great film."
1,No sound--save your money,This DVD goes silent starting in chapter 6. The sound doesn't work! What a joke. Save your money.
5,Pycnogenol Tablets,I take these daily. Actually I need to order more... Very good product. Would recommend to anyone. Arrived in great condition and very fast. Great Service
5,BLACKWOOD AT HIS BEST!,"I have been working my way through Algernon Blackwood's short stories (including his ""John Silence"" series), over the last year, and I have become very fond of his style of writing. With Blackwood, the atmosphere and mood of his stories frequently supersedes the plot so, if you're looking for a lot of pyrotechnics and fast-paced action, his writing is probably not for you. However, if you appreciate a true ""wordsmith"" as much as I do, then you will definitely enjoy the way he weaves a moody, palpably ""not-quite right"" atmosphere into what might, otherwise, seem like a boring, slow-moving story wherein not much happens. His descriptive prose frequently approaches poetry.I can see why H.P. Lovecraft thought so highly of Blackwood's work.I definitely recommend this collection (and other Blackwood stories) to those who appreciate quality writing that unfolds at its own pace over a lot of the ""wham-bam"" garbage that gives Horror and Dark Fantasy a bad name."
5,Great alphabet book!,I love this alphabet book! It has large letters & animal pictures along with adjectives describing the animals & their attitudes. I bought 2 more copies so I could hang the pictures on my son's wall. Great for any fan of Boynton or anyone who wants an entertaining & educational a-z book.
4,sandra does it again,sandra boynton never fails to amuse myself and my son.her clever word plays and fun illustrations are a gem of children's books.
4,A good introductory to political economy,"Although this book is nothing spectacular, it is what it is. This is the best introductory book on political economy that there is. Without being weighed down heavily by cumbersome mathmatics, etc. (which is something that economics teachers should probably leave to the appendixes) this book expalins most if not all of the major interest-areas in this ever important subdiscipline.There are no breathtaking theses in this book: it is simply the best minds in the business explaining their particular subdiscipline: be it voting beahvior or Niskeanan bureaucracy. As such, it is also a convienient reference for a more advanced student."
2,DEPRESSING,"I think willie is a very talented man,but this album gives me deppresion. A clasic example is the song ""I'm not trying to forget you anymore"". I could be walking home from school feeling happy, and the second I hear his music I just feel sad. The bottom line is, if you get depressed all the time and like willie nelson, this is a solid purchase. If not, look elsewhere."
5,Another Willie concept album,"There aren't many songs on this album that stand out individually (at least in comparison to some of his other 90's albums like Across the Borderline and Teatro), but Willie's latest concept album is strong anyway because of the way that the collection of music creates a mood for the listener. No one does the job that Willie does establishing a mood with such simple arrangements. Strange as it sounds, this album is morose and uplifting at the same time. You'll have to listen to understand"
5,"One he most inspired, deep-rooted performances of his career","This album is a must for any true Willie Nelson fan. The laid back but powerful ""attitude"" that is vintage Willie is made even more inspiring by the incorporation of true south-of-the-border flavor."
5,"""Spirit"" Will Touch You","Willie's signature relaxing Spanish themed guitar flows like a river, this CD has touched my deepest soul."
4,Requiem to a Lost Love,Willie Nelson's song speaks to those who have lost love. The painful memory of better times are echoed in the chords of his guitar. I've never heard a more suited collection of country ballads for the broken hearted.
2,looks nice but shoddy design,"I bought one of these from a local store, as the clean looking design is complimented nicely by the brushed nickel, which matched the other nickel hardware in my bathroom. Too bad the materials are cheap. The bolts holding the seat to the toilet do not stay tight, you have to constantly reach underneath to tighten them. If not done regularly the small screws holding the mdf seat to the hinges start stripping the mdf seat (it is a very cheap material and shouldn't have screws trying to stay tight drilled into it). Even with me regularly tightening the bolts the mdf eventually gave way, and the seat came apart from the hinges, requiring me to replace the whole thing. This was not just bad luck, as I had also bought one with the rubbed bronze hinges for a different bathroom and had the same problems. Also, don't use any heavy duty bathroom cleaners on it or the finish gets a stained look and will look dirty permanently."
2,COMMON SENSE! VERY REPEATATIVE!,"This book just repeats itself OVER and OVER and OVER again. I figure to make the book longer? Maybe they thought readers wouldn't notice? I don't know! But in the first chapter alone the idea: Know your grocery prices is headlined five times and under each headline is the pretty much the same paragraph worded differently. Come on how many different ways and how many times do you have to say ""know your prices""? This is the same for the topics: Plan your shopping list, know your coupons, ect. It was frustrating to continue to read thu the book to reread the same stuff over and over. Seems like a publicist or editor would have caught this?Anyways, the book is all common sense things you already know. Some I can't believe were even mentioned and made me laugh, ""Use bigger scissors to cut your coupons, it's faster than using small scissors"" REALLY? GREAT! Thanks! Didn't know that! LOL! Well, you get the point. There are better books out there than this. Save your money."
1,"Save your money, don't buy the book","I want to break this book down for you. Look at it in 3 parts.1st part- Common knowledge and same mission statement repeated over and over again.2nd part- Plugging her website which is more $ to spend.3rd part and comprises HALF of the total book- Telling you to donate food to charity. Nothing wrong with donating food, but it takes half the book to tell you this.I will take the 17.99 that I spent at a bookstore for this as a learned lesson."
4,Coupon secrets,"I purchased this for my mom & she likes it. She feels there are a lot of good tips to maximize your coupons. Item received as described, shipped fast, would buy from you again.Brian"
5,INTERESTING BOOK,RECEIVED PROMPTLY. HAVE BEEN READING THIS AND HAVE FOUND A GREAT DEAL OF INTERESTING INFORMATION.
1,Another Secret - Don't bother!,"Don't waste your hard earned money! You can learn most of her ""secrets"" on her website. Do your own homework, if none of your stores double coupons then there's no way you can save as much money as she claims. I'm in California and NONE of our local stores offer ""Double Coupons"". Also her weekly BEST DEALS list is only about 40% correct. Our actual coupons received and what coupons she lists is totally inaccurate. I've even emailed her several times and she never responds. What a total disapointment. If your really want the book, I'll sell you mine!"
1,secrets of coupon mom,Order took two weeks on standard mail to arrive. Packaged in flimsy paper folder that was torn upon delivery.
5,Such sane and easy words.,"I began the book last week. In it, I found such sane, easy, and simple ideas that I am amazed her strategy did not occur to me. Duh! ""Use coupons while the item is on sale."" It more than DOUBLES your savings at the check out, if not makes the item(s) free! Double-DUH! So simple!This is but one peace of sane advice from the coupon mom. It was like reading a mystery, learning who did it and why, and wanting to hit myself in the forehead. All the facts were there. Only the ""coupon mom"" figured it out and published it so that others, such as myself, could learn.This book will probably pay for itself in one, single trip to the grocery store. NO KIDDING! Highly recommended!Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Don't bother with the book... save your dollars and go to the website for the few good tips. If you already use coupons then there is nothing new here... If you're a working mom then you don't have the time to play around going from store to store (and with gas prices these days, is it really worth it to run from store to store anyway).Finally, if you live in a rural area, as I do, it's not worth it at all because we just don't have the variety of stores from which to shop. Not a good use of your valuable dollar."
3,The Silk Man,"The title literally means ""The Paper Man"" but the b/w Serbian translation I've read was named ""The Silk Man."" Anyway, the point is that one of the two main characters (the Caucasian cowboy) is considered too tender by his companion (the native American Indian woman).The story about their travel has some elements of magic realism and not all pieces fit. For example, they get extremelly fast from the Grand Canyon to Fort Larammy, basically on foot. But the Western atmosphere and sentiments have been rendered quite well, while the tragicomic human interest story is enterntaining and involving."
3,This is okay,This is not at all a bad performance but it pales in comparison with the ones by Colin Davis and Richard Bonynge.
2,Bottom line: Two excellent songs. The rest are awful,"There are two awesome songs on this album: ""Bound For the Floor"" and ""Fritz's Corner"". The rest of the songs are so awful they aren't even worth listening to. They're not mediocre or middle-of-the-road; they're crap. They're sludgy and they've got no hook or melody. Go ahead: Say that Grunge isn't about melody, but any WORTHWHILE music is. If you take away the elitist label, then you have to judge it on its own merits. And that's what I'm judging As Good as Dead by. It's a shame Local H couldn't have cranked out another ten songs like those for this album... even if the band does try its hardest at ripping off Nirvana. Not that I care though: the two excellent songs on here are better than anything Cobain did."
3,Debut of the Nirvana clone fails to impress,"As much as I love the band's effort, I'd advise people to pass over this album by Local H, one of the first of many Nirvana wanabees. Some songs are sheer genius--""Fritz's Corner"" has the best mix of loud guitars and screaming I've ever heard in a grunge song. ""Bound for the Floor"" is also a great single.However, singles cannot carry an album alone. All the rest of the songs should be just as good, and this album is filled with slow plodding tracks. Some of the songs have long interludes with acoustic guitar followed by loud electric power chords. There are very few dynamics in these filler tracks. Unlike the Smashing Pumpkins' album ""Siamese Dream,"" the boring parts just continue on end.It's a shame because the singles are just awesome. If you really like the singles on this album, get it. Otherwise, just buy Nirvana's album ""Nevermind."""
3,Hmmmmm.....,"Man, these guys are crazy. Its not a BAD album; cool trax like Eddie Vedder and Bound for the Floor rock. But, there's a lot of stuff I don't really like. If you're into loud, heavy, depressing tunes, here ya go."
1,The Worst Cd I own,I can honestly say that i can't stand this CD. I bought it when Bound for the Floor was popular. I thought it was the best song ever and expected the rest of the CD to be the same way. The rest of the album is the complete opposite. Don't waste your money on this horrible CD. It isn't worth it.
4,Terribly underrated; a fine collection of songs.,"At first, I was skeptical of this album. The sticker on the front advertised not good music, but gratuitous use of ""the F-word."" Island never knew how to promote Local H, a truly first-rate band with incredible range. I still don't know how two guys are able to pack such a punch without help from outside, but Scott and Brian are pros at the game.""Bound for the Floor"" is a perfect anthem for the 1990s, but other singles like ""Fritz's Corner"" and the brilliant ""Eddie Vedder"" are just as good. If you can't see the band live and hear unreleased classics like ""Baby Wants to Tame Me,"" then at least get yourself this album. Otherwise, you'll miss out entirely on some phenomenal music."
4,Powerful post-grunge music,"I generally don't listen to Rock -- I prefer techno -- but this is one of the few rock albums that is always in my cd changer. Local H extends early-90's grunge in a manner that is always original, never imitative. If all you've heard of Local H is ""Bound for the Floor"" (Copacetic), if you're a fan of Nirvana or any other grunge bands, pick up this CD!"
5,Swiss Army Knife & Mini Flashlight Set,"These are not exactly what I was looking for but they came very close to what I was looking for and they are very good, too! Great value and a great set to have! :)"
4,Nice gift set,This set consisting of one of the smaller Swiss Army knives and a pocket-sized mag light makes a great guy gift. Victorinox is known for quality and this set does not disappoint.
5,"very stable laptop, much better than sony vaio",i bough this laptop because my sony vaio is very disappointed me.x1030 is ver stable and runs multi-task very well. you can watch DVD and run VB program or word without a problem. also the slim designed body is very easy to carry.
2,Hmmm...,"Some 35 years since its brief release it is unclear why Rita Hayworth chose to appear in ""THE NAKED ZOO"". What is clear is that the film is very poor. Utterly directionless, with no real storyline (although a twist in the final scene!) and shot in ""softporn soft focus"", it really ISN'T the place to start your Rita Hayworth DVD collection! ""THE NAKED ZOO"" is more a curio from the Love Generation and certainly ain't no ""GILDA""!For Rita Hayworth completists only."
2,Arrowhead Stadium Print,"Would have been a beautiful print if it did not have a crease in it, I assume from shipping and handling. I did not want to deal with the hassel of returning it so I just accepted it."
3,A few good songs and some pap.,"I'm a big fan of these guys and this album wasn't the best experience. It looks like it's supposed to be a double album, but really it isn't. You get one disk with ""Disc One"" tracks, ""Disc Two"" is an iTunes only feature. You have to have the disc in a computer to unlock those tracks in iTunes. This is completely counter to the image of the band and my experience with their music. I only bought this thinking there was more bang for the buck; had I known what was up, I would have bought another Jackpot album. With this, I got only a handful of good tunes. Not one of their best even beyond the technical B.S. Get ""Weightless"" instead."
3,The Let Down,"The revised edition of John Fowles novel,The Magus, is one of the best works of fiction I have ever read and contend it as one of my all-time favorites. Have it in my library. Seeing the movie without reading the book is meaningless. But the DVD is worthwhile because of the young performers namely Michael Caine and Candice Bergen. A two hour movie does not do justice to the novel itself. Buy the book or get a copy from the library. The revised edition preferably."
1,The Magus. A below average film.,"Not much to say. A simply below average film. Stick to the book, which is really superb."
5,This Movie Was Weird In 1968 And It Is Still Pretty Weird Today!,"I remember seeing this movie when I was 8 years old on late night TV because even back then I liked beautiful women such as Candice Bergen.Anyway enough about my Youthful Raging Hormonal Desires. The plot of this movie seems to be about this English guy who travels to a mysterious Greek Island where nothing is what it appears to be. This kind of reminds me of the ""Promise "" of Enlightenment and Education that they said I would get in College. I give this movie 5 stars because Ms. Bergen doesn't even have to take her clothes off in it to look really hot!"
3,"A recommendation, and one correction to the overall plot description.","One comment: I fully agree with another reviewer here: READ THE BOOK FIRST!!!Absent this, the movie will be incomprehensible.(BTW, there are in fact two version of the book around because Fowles revised it at some point.)And a correction to the main plot summary: Lily is NOT Conchis' wife! (How the writer got this impression, I have no idea.)Good luck, and I hope you enjoy it--or at least, enjoy the book!"
1,1 star w/explanation or i'm not jiggy with Jiggy,"i ordered a motorhead classic T-shirt, which is supposed to have only the motorhead logo on the front, nothing on the back. just like it was described when i ordered it. on or around the same day the shirt arrived, i get an email from ""Jiggy"" the vendor. (wtf with that name anyway. jiggy? do they specialize in Will Smith merch or what?) the email says that if i have any questions about my order to email them. so i politely inquire why the T-shirt i received has some printing on the back because the shirt i ordered wasn't supposed to have anything on the back. a month goes by and no response from the JiggyPeople. why send a customer an email asking if they have any questions about their order and then not respond when they email you with a question about their order? do you see the irony here, Jiggy? so anyway, next time i need a t-shirt, i'll get it from one of the thousand or so other places i could choose from."
4,"Not their best, but still a good album","The 2000 production of the Flower Kings is great - although it can't keep up with its predecessors ""Stardust we are"" and ""Flower Power"". Contrary to the latter, which contained about 60 minutes of joint work by Roine Stolt and Tomas Bodin, ""Space Revolver"" is again heavily dominated by Roine Stolt compositions. Both Tomas Bodin and Hasse Fröberg have contributed very short tracks of less than 3 minutes. The CD is ProgRock in its purest form - highly inventive, with great melodies and perfect guitar/keyboard arrangements. The style is less homogenous than on previous albums - that's why I had to subtract one star from the maximum rating. However, most Flower Kings fans agree that it contains another Roine Stolt masterpiece: ""A King's Prayer"". This is probably the most touching ballad that I have heard in my lifetime."
4,Different but good,"I own only two other Flower Kings cd's - Alive on Planet Earth and Flower Power. I prefer each of those, but this is a very good cd. The production is heavier than the other two, but the vocal quality and overall sound more than make up for the sometimes ""heavy handed"" approach. I also noticed that they flexed their technical muscles a little bit more on this cd. As with the other two cd's there are some very beautiful songs on this one. If you are a fan of their other works, Dream Theater, Spock's Beard, Yes and the like, you will enjoy this cd."
3,The Flower Kings can do better that this,"I am a fan of the band, I have discover them with this album, I have to say that this one is one of their weakest work. The album open with force with I am the sun part one, but the song is getting weaker and weaker as it progress. The best cuts for me are ""Rumble fish twist"" and the closing track ""I am the sun part two"" The previous and the following album of the band were better in my opinion."
3,It's a mix.,"This CD is worth the fifteen bucks just because of the first half. The second half leaves me worried though. After ""Chicken Farmer Song"", the band sounds almost mainstream. Granted, it's GOOD mainstream, but it's not the type of music we associate The Flower Kings with. Check out one of their others first, like Flower Power."
5,Not 5* but 10*,"Amazon, you need to increase your star rating to 10. The Flower Kings have surpassed their previous genius with this ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE. When this CD is at 76.10 on the timer, after you have been thoroughly immersed in FK's magic, melody and prophesy, all you can say is, this CD can't be finished, there must be more....please. It transcends and soars above the redundant musical catagorizations and boundaries with sheer genius. IT IS BRILLIANT."
4,A new direction for The Flower Kings,"""Space Revolver"" marked a major change in The Flower King's sound. The replacement of bassist Michael Stolt with Jonas Reingold took the band into a funkier, more jazz oriented sound. It's a shade more, dare I say, progressive, than earlier recordings such as ""Stardust We Are"" and ""Retropolis.""The album's greatest strength is in the performances. Reingold is without doubt a virtuoso player who keeps the tempo fast and fresh, while keyboardist Thomas Bodin turns in some impressive melodies in the title track ""I Am The Sun,"" a massive tribute to that great ball of helium in the sky. Lead guitarist Roine Stolt, meanwhile, shows off his perfect chops in ""A King's Prayer"" and ""Rumble Fish Twist.""If you've only heard The Flower King's first four albums, this one will come as a surprise. Nevertheless, while this is a welcome change the band have honed their new sound and created better albums since."
5,My favorite FK record,"I have all their stuff and this one is my favorite. Long enough to savor the wonderful extravagance, but tighter than Flower Power and Stardust and the other big projects. Beautiful music all around - highly recommended.Ken"
5,Amazing,"I'll make this short. If you love symphonic progressive rock then you need this in your collection ASAP. Combining the best elements of the greats (Yes, Genesis, ELP, etc.), these guys are unstoppable and display an amazing grasp of musicianship, arranging and composing skills that are unsurpassed. A pleasure to listen to from beginning to end."
5,My favorite PJ CD...,"This is the first review I've ever written on AMZN, for my favorite PJ Harvey CD. Maybe it means I'm not a true fan, but I find the combination of her lyrics and melodies and John Parish's music to be perfect. It's an incredibly atmospheric record, with some amazing moments of words and music colliding in the most delightful ways... not easy listening, and I usually skip the cover of ""Is That All There Is?"", but otherwise 5 stars."
3,Mediocre.,I don't listen to this much. I'm literally obsessed with the music of PJ Harvey (and John Parish in some cases) - but these songs sound unfinished and uncomprhendable.
5,buy it,"Why would anyone give this review less than 5 stars? most of these songs, if not all, are freestyle classics. they are near impossible to find on vinyl, let alone on cd. so grab this compilation while you can. With your first listen, the memories created during this era will come flooding back. they were good times, for sure. its worth every penny you spend."
5,It works,This is the second non-contact voltage tester I have had. It works well. No complaints. Rugged and does the job.
3,An interesting style of writing,"This book was initially difficult for me to get into. It reads like several short stories and I had a hard time staying interested in the main character. It felt very disjointed. However, after I got to the middle of the book, got accustomed to the writing style and knew Yo a little better, I really started to enjoy her. I was teary at the end because I found that I really liked this person. I was touched by her and all that she had experienced through the eyes of her family and friends."
3,The Interesting Book,"Initially our thoughts, about the book called ¡Yo! Are that it is an impressive novel. This novel represents the thoughts that people have about the girl name Yolanda Garcia. Therefore our opinions about the author Julia Alvarez way of writing the book ¡Yo! Are that the book's paragraph structure is challenging to understand. Julia Alvarez writes the book ¡Yo! Using many points of views from different people targeting Yolanda Garcia. To conclude our opinions about the book ¡Yo! We would like to say that the book is interesting yet challenging."
5,It was a good time spender,"This book really makes you think about what it is that people think about you, although it could be bad there are also good points. This book i enjoyed alot and it's recommened be me!!!"
5,memoir masquerading as fiction,"I've never known anyone (clearly Julia Alvarez is writing about herself in this book, maximizing on the genre of creative nonfiction and morphing it into Fiction) with such an ability to see oneself as others see one. I've written a memoir myself (Baby Catcher: Chronicles of a Modern Midwife) about my 15 years as a homebirth midwife in Berkeley, and I could never come close to Ms. Alvarez's unflinching self-analysis through the eyes of others. Cudos to this prolific, entertaining, and self-revealing author. I have met her at bookstore reading events, and she is as delightful in person as she is in print. Write on!"
4,A life story,The author uses this book to describe how an author develop materials for a book for which she is writing. This is a story of family with all its craziness.
3,Not a very productive Book!,"I bought this book in mind, that it will guide you with the smooth transition of fsm/fsa to modern UML based state-charts. providing practical examples in C/C++ as the title is""Practical Statecharts in C/C++"" that means guide you from design of state-charts to implementations, it lacks in that too. not a very exciting and practical examples.. My expectations were very high for this book, i thought this is it, we have some good additions in fsm category. little bit disappointed. Good points are the Quantum programming discussion is very well written and does a great deal of job there! There is nothing new or well written for state-machines. for that you you have to really look for other books.... allrighty, thanks"
1,Useless Book,"As a senior computer engineer who has been in embedded systems programming for 5 years, I found this book very useless.If you are looking for my advice, just save your momey and find something else."
2,Overpriced Tea,I bought this tea on sale at Whole Foods for $6.99. It is definitely overpriced at the sale price. The quality is only average. I actually thought it lacked flavor. There are much better black teas on the market for far less.
3,Excellent album from rather unknown group!,"Searching through the CDs, I found this one that caught my eye. I took it over to the listening station and gave it a listen, and I was quite impressed with this CD from what I heard!The vocals on the CD are very good to say the least, in a few of the songs, you can hear where she really shines, like in ""Time"". Some of the songs are slow, others are upbeat and garage bandy sounding, like ""Fascination"" or ""Ha Ha"".All in all, this is an averagish CD. Nothing quite different, the scheme is pretty much the same it seems. But if you like bands like ""Metric"" or ""The Fitness"", you'll probably like ""Monsters are Waiting"" as well."
1,go away monsters are waiting.....,"Boy is this band lame or what? The songs are slow, not catchy and she can't even sing. Jon, go back to Eve 6 and make some real quality music again!! EVE 6 ROCKS!!"
2,Fairly dull,"I got the book for the worst reason: the title. Someone had mentioned the Blue Harpsichord as an inspiration for wanting a (blue) harpsichord. And it was inexpensive. As a harpsichord enthusiast I looked in vain for something to latch onto. The characters are so numerous and thinly sketched that I quickly lost my way. Some sort of a crime story, involving an unconvincing Latin professor who looks like a young businessman. Who cares. I abandoned the book about half way. Better things to do."
5,Does anyone know the Jazz song,Hi- in the movie Basquiat is painting in the basement and hes listening to a live broadcast of Charlie Parker (I believe)- does anyone know what that song is? And where I can find it?
5,"No matter where I am, This album goes with me","Both the movie & this soundtrack opened my eyes to a world that I had taken for granted. As an aspiring music connoisseur I find this collection to be nothing short of amazing, spanning heartfelt sorrow to vivid provocation. One question that I didn't see below; I know that PJ Harvey is on the album, but if that is her voice in the film then I am terribly confused."
4,Good But Buy The Film Instead,"This a good soundtrack to a great film. Wait's, Public Enemy, and Van Morrison's cover of Dylan's ""Its All Over Now Baby Blue"" are all great. In response to the fellow from Sydney about the Jazz track, that was Blue and Green, from the album Kind Of Blue, by Miles Davis. The whole CD is great and there are actually a few other Miles songs in the movie. Does anyone know what song is played during opening titles, I love it but have no idea what it is. This a good cd, but your money would be better spent on a movie that is worth owning twice."
5,THE SONG DURING THE BIKE RIDE THROUGH CENTRAL PARK,"Great soundtrack but yeah I've also been trying hard to find this track, and its called India by The Psycadelic Furs."
4,Buy it,"My personal favorite is David Bowie's update of his song ""A Small Plot of Land"" - punctuated the intensity of the enotional scene struggling with giving up on the world and giving in to the heroin."
3,The Mezmerizing Pogues Tune is Missing,"This cd has a good compilation of tunes from the movie, except for the greatest one...If I Should Fall from Grace - the Pogues. I can't seem to find the version of that song used in the movie, only the quick tempo original. Too bad!"
5,Basement Scene Music,"I know the artist is Miles Davis and I believe the chart is ""Flemenco Sketches"""
3,Help!!,Can Anyone please tell me what the jazz track is that Jean Michel is listening to in the film in his headphones when he walks into the gallery for his major opening????? Much Appreciated!
2,To Chris in Ft. Lauderdale,The song Basquiat opens to is Fairytale of New York by The Pogues. The name of the record is If I should fall from grace with God. The soundtrack should have included the jazz he painted to. I don't understand what two Texas bands from the 90's are doing on the soundtrack. I doubt those were in his collection.
4,Basquiat is alive.,"Having read the previous reviews I would like to clear one thingup. Jean Michel Basquiat is in fact still alive, he did not diein the early 1980's but instead faked his own death to escape hisgrowing fame and heroin addiction. He retired to Cuba where hehas lived quietly to the present day - I know this for a factbecause on a recent holiday I bumped into him at a bar where hewas having a few drinks with Tupac Shakur. Both are very well.Great soundtrack, by the way."
5,Incredible Compilation,"I place this soundtrack in the upper echelon of film soundtracks. It has had such a profound impact on my musical taste, as the film had on my taste for visual art. ""Tom Traubert's blues"" was my introduction to Tom Waits and I've devoured everything else since then, and long to play his songs on the keyboards. Brian Kelly's "" and Keith Richards' ""The Nearness of you"" (which was in the film but unfortunately not on this soundtrack probably because it was a studio session)are also incredible. Need I mention ""It's all over now, baby blue"" by Van Morrison? One of his finest songs... A must have!!!"
3,ANSWER,"yeah, thats Waits, its called ""Red House"", off of Bone Machine i think (without looking at an album listing). cool movie, artsy sound track, David Bowie was the best thing in this movie"
4,Basquiat is alive.,"Actually, Basquiat played himself in the film. And chose the music for the soundtrack. In an interesting side-note, Amadeus chose all the music for the film bearing his name, and was the executive producer."
4,Hawley recommended!,"At last, a disc to stick in between the Nick Lowe ""crooner"" trilogy (Impossible Bird, Dig My Mood, The Convincer). Like Lowe, Hawley writes strong material and sings it in a warm, trustworthy voice perfect for 3 a.m. Also like Lowe, he has his hard rocking period behind him for the moment (a former member of Pulp) but now sounds like a man who has come to terms with himself. So, you'll find several touching love songs, along with a tribute to the pleasures of riding his motorcycle (see it on the cover). No cool poses, just the truth as he sees it. Nothing fancy in the way of instrumentation either--everything serves a purpose, and the playing is as warm as the vocals (Hawley is also an outstanding guitarist). In these cheesy American Idol days, let's celebrate honesty and real talent where we can find them. Lowedges is a great place to start--one of the 3 best albums I've heard this year."
5,Strikes a chord,"This album is touching from start to finish. It is a seminal example of one person speaking to another through music. In few words, and few chords, Hawley manages to articulate feelings that would otherwise have no outlet. My favorite track, ""Oh My Love"", captures all of the awe, tenderness, and resignation of a sparkling love that for whatever reason, cannot bear fruit. Moving."
2,OBTUSE ESSAY OF NETWORKING ESSENTIALS,"The compilation entitled ""Implementing Cisco VPNs"" was a rather disappointing choice of technical literature. A significant amount of text was devoted to development of PPTP services and related Microsoft networking concepts. Although this information may have value at some fundamental level, it really serves to deliver deminishing impact when constructing environments of highly scalable architecture and elevated security requirements. The chapter on Dial-up networking presented an anomaly with respect to concept flow. Information of greater value may be found free of charge on Cisco's website."
4,"Known Space Rules! Interesting as hell, too.","This collection of stories was the first book of the now renowned Known Space Series. A lot of the stories are from a long time ago, so they seem kind of outdated, but most of them are still pure Niven, pure cool. Especially liked that one, ""Hole Man"" I believe it was, where the scientist on Mars murders someone with a black hole. Man, this is some good stuff."
5,Libby Coco Cola Glasses,"These are very good glasses, and I highly recommend them. And I will puchase another another set when I have a need for glasses!"
5,like to teach the world to sing....,Glasses remind me of the ones i had as a kid. They are original memories....It reminds me to slow down and relax
3,Great glases; can get them cheaper though,I love these glasses. They're very sturdy.We found them on sale at the dollar tree for $1 a piece.
4,Guitar Footrest,"Purchased and delivered without incident and timing was very good. The item is described as Oak - the one I received was not. It was maple with a very nice finish - I like maple over oak anyway.Works well, is very comfortable with a good ergonomic angle to the foot. I would note there is nothing to prevent the footrest from folding back up with an errant kick - a keeper of some type would be an improvement.All in all, I consider this to be a good value and I am satisfied."
5,great quality!,This is great! it's so nice looking i can leave it out but it's also so easy to flatten and put in the carry bag. I love it and take it everywhere! it seems very sturdy too and has three height options. very cool!
5,a book of beautiful photos,this is a very good book although it is quite short. the photos in it are beautiful. the book is well worth the price.
4,What Has He Become?,"Dyno seems to come laid back on this one. He has one old school sounding song on there. Also has some gangsta beats. Dyno covers almost everything on his new album. My favorites are 2,5,6,7 and 9. Only one song that I didn't like. If you are a true DARKROOM FAN then you should get this one."
1,personally i think this stuff is bap,"yo holla, playa. this stuff is old school shiznit. it is bap, this mofo aint keepin it gangsta, and if yall fools think he is then you playin yoselves. im out, latah.Sticky Ike"
5,I love this movie...its the greatest ever!!!!!,PN is wonderful ..I really enjoy the conversation the dialouge is to die for --I mean nowadays there is never any word wars--smart word wars---IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT WATCH IT NOWOne word WITTY!
5,One of my favorite Pual Newman Movie,"Love this movie! I cannot tell you how many times I have seen this movie. All the actors are excellent in this and Paul.....whew, looks Great!!"
5,"The Long, Hot Summer","Paul and Joanne at their best. This and ""Cat on..."" are both in the same category...excellent movies at their best!!!"
5,Best of the best,There are only about ten movies I can watch over and over. This is one of them. The version with Don Johnson Judith Ivie and Cybill Shepherd is also good (I just looked it up-- had not remembered Ava Gardner was in the Johnson version). But Newman-Woodward is the best of the best!
2,hemingway,"I enjoyed Paul Newman in this film. The plot could have been better. The portrayal of the secondary characters was needless. Orsen Welles was enjoyable to watch as Joanne Woodward's father. Angela Lansbury was cute in her role as Welle's girlfriend. Not the best Paul Newman movie, but he as always, gorgeous to look at."
4,DON'T GO TO THE WELLES TOO OFTEN,"A really good motion picture with Newman earning an Oscar as a southern misfit who suddenly becomes a Welles favorite. Welles,43, dominates the film as a 60 year old property owner who's looking for someone to oversee his southern ranch/ land ownings. Franciosa, Welles' son,is a total dud to his father. Enter Newman,in whom Welles develops a grudging respect, enough to entrust his posesssions (including his daughter in an arranged marriage to attempt to produce a male heir). Enter daughter Woodward,who breaks off one relationship and then develops an open disdain for Newman.Civil War 2 is averted when Franciosa burns down the family barn with Welles inside, thus proving to the eventually rescued old man that his son has gumption after all.One problem: this is a film for impending geriatrics,definitely not filmed for 2008 adolescents. Sadly!"
2,Tennessee Williams Wannabe,"This film seemed to be an attempt to give an encore to Newman's searing performance in Tennessee Williams' ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"" complete with big Southern daddy character and twangy speech, but the missing elements were: 1) Williams' gift for dialogue, 2) a truly compelling plot, and 3) a worthy counterpart to the female leading role of Maggie the Cat. Woodward is a talented character actress in her own right (see ""The Three Faces of Eve,"" for sure), but she is missing a character to play here. Plus, let's face it, Liz Taylor she is NOT, and she does not cut it as sultry bait for Newman's lusty drifter. I'm sorry, but the attraction between her and Newman has been and always will be a mystery to me. If you want show-stopping performances, wallop-packing dialogue, and enough heat to singe your eyebrows over an authentic Southern flame, buy ""Cat..."" instead."
5,Entertaining Southern Soap Opera,"This is a very entertaining melodrama. Paul Newman is incredibly handsome as a charismatic drifter and Joanne Woodward is perfect as a repressed yet spunky schoolteacher. Orson Welles plays Woodward's father in a manner that brings Boss Hogg to mind. His fake Southern accent, though, is so tough to understand it is fortunate that this film is close captioned. Lee Remick is lovely as a brainless Southern belle but Tony Francioso seems miscast as Welles's despised weakling son. Angela Lansbury is also at hand and does a passing Southern accent for a British gal. The ending is not at all what I expected but I'm sure it pleased 1950's movie audiences. An AMC channel ""Back Story"" is included with Newman, Lansbury and Woodward sharing their memories of making the film."
4,GREAT CLASSIC!!!,"I loved this movie!!!I keep watching it again and agian.Director Martin Ritt made this movie work.This is a moody drama,adapted from Faulkner Story,about small- town lovers resisting paternal tyrant's mandates.A favorite movie for drama and classic movie lovers.Out of 10 I would give this a 7."
5,FAST DELIVERY,THANK YOU FOR THE SPEEDY CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER MADE!!!! LOVE THAT PAUL NEWMAN.......YOU GET 5 STARS FOR QUICK DELIVERY!!!!
5,Paul Newman At His Best,"This is a great movie with a little something for everyone. Writers of the older movies managed to express the gamut of human emotions and get their point across without the use of bad language. If you need to use bad language, you are a poor writer with a limited vocabulary."
5,It wasn't just hot - it was SIZZLING!,I've had a copy of this classic movie in VHS format for many years. This Amazon.com purchase was simply to upgrade to DVD. One of my all-time favorites.
4,LOU IS A PRETTY THING,"Lou Pride I WON'T GIVE UP KS 9441 Lou has got the pipes thing downcold...With a little help from Kingsnake house band, Lou just sets em' up &knocks em' down. MIGHT GIVE OUT outstanding balls to the wall tune. Does justiceto DEEPER SHADE OF BLUE, Roy Roberts tune. BLUES FOR CRYING OUT LOUDhorns blaring, Lou out front, doin' his thang.

2,This pair is Joe Hollywood,I have a pair of these that got broken; I loved them. I'd give these a 5 Star rating but the frames are a glitter black - I feel fabulous wearing them!
1,Cheap,You can buy better sunglasses at Walmart for $10. Bought from Sunglasses Giant who said the glasses retailed for $98.00 (what a joke). Will never buy from Sunglasses Giant again. Misleading website.
3,Good for the non-communicative couple,"This book wasn't too bad, but it was really aimed at couples who are not in touch with each other. Most of the advice was not needed for us as we are not afraid to share. I was looking for something a little different than this; however, I know several friends of mine who would benefit from the information and plans laid out in this book. Definitely get this book if you feel your partner is nervous or unsure about lovemaking."
2,Good tips but very one-sided,"I eagerly awaited EO and read it carefully. There is much good information about a man expanding the pleasure of a woman but essentially nothing about expanding the man's orgasm. I reread the cover to see if I'd missed something informing me that this book is about coaching, and considers enhancing women's pleasure only. My re-review revealed nothing about the onesidedness. Certainly I love giving my partner incredible sexual pleasure. And my level of excitement is directly connected to her's. But what about some thoughts on how to touch a man, talk to a man, truly share with a man. While I will study the book and we will explore its suggestions, I feel a little [cheated]. I have erotic senses too."
1,Misleading title!,"This is not so much a review as it is a protest. The title of this book should be ""Expanded Orgasm for Women."""
1,For Useless Academics,"If you are a practicioner, skip this book. Even academics will find this rehash (and outright clone) of better material a waste of time."
3,Interesting,"Yvgenie is the third book in a difficult to follow, but eminently enjoyable series. it is awfully nice to get to enter the world of Sasha and Pieter again, and to try to wade through Cherryh's complicated prose, (it really is worth the you spend to try to understand it.) The way that Cherryh approaches magic in this book is really quite fascinating, and extremely complicated. When a wish that you make can defy all time constraints and work in the past, or the future, things are bound to get difficult. Well, I am not going to try to explain everything in this short review. Let me just say that if you are looking for a book that will get you thinking, or just a good time, don't pass this one up."
2,"Functional, though disappointing","These speakers are better than the internal speaker in my computer, by a longshot, but I am disappointed that an AC Adapter did not come with it, runs on AAA batteries, the cord between the speakers is too short, and the speakers periodically (often) have noise (apparently very cheap wires that pick up any small bit of interference). However, they are help in my office where the internal laptop speaker was not sufficient."
4,Power Adapter?,"The size and quality of the speakers are great! I use them with my laptop but the batteries need to be replaced often. I am looking for a power adapter (5.0 volts) and so far with no luck. Si-Technologies offers one but they want another $13 for it. If you just want to use these speakers with the batteries, you will be amazed at the quality considering their size."
2,disappointed,"after reading the excellent reviews, i was very disappointed with the sound quality from these speakers. if you plan on playing them even slightly loud the distortion is incredible"
1,"Good sound, but didn't last long","I bought these speakers to take on vacations with my MP3 player, and they actually have pretty good sound for their size. However, after only two uses, one of the speakers lost its sound unless you press on the face of it. I would suggest buying any other speakers but these!"
3,"Portable, but wheres the bass?","Pro:- Small size (the speakers are the size of a cd player, excluding the amplifier and the wires)- Portable when used with batteriesCon:- Bruch was right about the speakers. They do sound doll on the bass side.- When the batteries die out you'll hear a hear raising yell coming out of the speakers."
1,Absolutely horrible...,"And absolute waste of money. I threw them away. I am no audiophile by any stretch, but this is the worse sound I have heard from any speakers any time.I don't care what kind of deal you may get on these, stay far away. They are not worth the effort of removing them from the box."
1,Horrible,"These little speakers are loud and cheap, but the cords suck and there is little or no bass on these speakers. Buy the version with the external subwoofer, it's worth the extra money."
2,Disappointed with these after reading so many rave reviews,"Yes, these are small and light. Now the bad news: The separate amplifier and all the wires going everywhere makes the connected assembly look like a science lab project, especially if you opt for the USB power connector.Yes, the sound quality is better than the one inch speakers in my IBM ThinkPad but not nearly as good as your typical $19 desktop computer speakers. The problem is that the sound is limited to highs with little if any midrange. Bass is nonexistent. It's like listening to a pair of big tweeters. The enthusiastic reviews are a mystery to me."
2,Nice size but zero bass,"Small, portable, nice design with plenty of treble and middle frequencies but no bass. If you want your CDs and MDs to sound as if they were being played through an old 2"" TV speaker, these are for you. If you prefer a fuller sound, you won't like these speakers. Another caution: They have very powerful magnets. Don't put them anywhere near any magnetic-type data storage (floppies, hard disks)."
1,my notebook speakers actually sound better.,"I ordered these to carry around in my notebook bag after reading good reviews, and was seriously disappointed. The sound quality is mediocre. The low-end is nonexistent, and my notebook speakers have slightly better mid-range; only the high-end comes through at all. Moreover, the sound is REALLY quiet (2 watts per channel, maybe I should've expected that).Two other drawbacks: you can clearly see the DC-in on the little amp module in the photos, so I expected it to come with a wall power converter--not so. I keep having to remember to turn it off when I step away to conserve batteries. And, the speaker magnets are strong enough (and unshielded enough) that I can't throw it in a bag with my computer without thought.Overall, a waste. I'm sending it back."
2,Good if you don't have any Speakers,"I bought these speakers to use with my Toshiba Satelite 2805-s402 Laptop. Unfortunately, i found that these speakers were not a significant improvement over my laptop speakers.They are very small, and they snap together handily, making them great for traveling, but i would only buy them for use with a discman, mp3 player, or something similar that has no speaker function."
4,excellent,"its not the best sound when you turn it up all the way but otherwise its wicked good. the sound it pretty good if you keep it at a resonable level. if you just want something to play your cd or mp3 player outloud this is the thing to get, it's cheap and has great quality"
5,SI-5 portable speakers,I hooked these up to both my Dell laptop and my Compaq hanheld and was shocked at the clarity and depth of the sound. I am sold!!A.P.
4,Great for the Price,"For 20$, these are very impressive little speakers. They look a lot chaper than they sound; the cardboard-like grill did not impress me. But, give them a chance, they impressed me a lot once I truned them on (and I am an audiophile). The mid bass and the highs are much cleaner than I expected. There is no deep bass, but I expected that. Also, the surround effect is nice especially when you have the spakers placed on your work table at near-ear level. Great for travel as they are very compact. However, if you want pounding bass you should maybe look into a subwoofer design, but then again those will not be so compact and inexpensive :) Good job, Sonic!"
5,This is shocking,"When I first got these speakers, I was extremely apprehensive, as I had read both hateful and raving reviews for this. After testing them out on various songs/games/registers, I found that these speakers are spectacular. They're clear, give great surround sound, and give ample bass, ESPECIALLY considering their size and price (I paid 20 bucks for them). These are a total steal, and you will be stunned when you turn them on the first time. Fantastic speakers."
2,somewhat disappointed,"The unit works well after sorting through all the wires. The lead from the music source is extremely short and requires some dexterity. The biggest complaint is the battery cover which refuses to stay on with modest handling. Also, the on-off switch is cheaply constructed and I found it prudent to remove the batteries when travelling. Switch activated when travelling and caused battery loss. A neat gadget for the price. Sound quality is more than reasonable for the weight and compactness."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"These speakers would have been a perfect compliment to my portable DVD player due to their size and portability, however, the volumn was minimal even after purchasing new batteries. These speakers were beautiful in appearance but wiring could be more substantial. Speakers should be shipped with DC power supply to improve performance."
1,Caveat Emptor,"Buyers should be aware that this release primarily consists of year 2000 re-recordings of classic early 80's material. Only one original member of Agent Orange, Mike Palm is credited as having participated in the recording sessions."
2,Some things are best left alone,"Don't waste your time. I saw Agent Orange about a year ago at the Avalon in Boston. Maybe it was the sound system, but they were not what they once were - much like this album. Stick to the original Posh Boy release of Living in Darkness. Maybe it IS better to burn out, than fade away . . ."
5,This tool did things I never thought possible,"My 4-lb Maltese has terrible teeth. We brush her teeth every night now, but the plaque is still really thick and ugly. One night, my girlfriend held her down while I scraped her teeth. By using the squarish end, putting the edge just below her gumline, and pulling down, I was able to chip off huge chunks of plaque, revealing white teeth underneath. On her molars, I chipped off a piece that was 3-5mm in diameter. Even on her front teeth, I was able to chip off some of the gross dark colored stuff. It took forever and I was not able to clean between teeth or in the creases in the middle of the molars, but it was pretty painless and didn't draw any blood.I haven't yet tried this tool on my German Shepherd. I suspect this may not end well."
5,Good Value,"We wanted to improve our dental care for a 13 year old cairn terrier. It's risky to use general anesthesia on a dog this old for teeth cleanings. So we brush daily and apply a topical tartar control. This new tool has already been useful in removing stubborn tartar. Our vet says his teeth are in extraordninary shape, and our pet has not had a cleaning under anethesia in four years. This tool performs exactly as we hoped it would."
3,Dental scraper,"This is not what I expected when I bought it. I thought it was a pointy probe that would fit between the teeth. Instead, it is more like a flat screwdriver that is sharper for scraping flat surfaces. Either I made a mistake and didn't realize what I was getting or the picture didn't depict it properly. I'll keep it and just reorder another probe someday."
4,Decent,"Care and practice are required for good results. Practice on a hard flat surface like a piece of wood to learn correct angle to hold tool for maximum cleaning ability. Be extra careful not to cut your pets gums. If your pet allows you to brush their teeth,chances are they will be ok with this tool as well."
5,Dental Device Works,"You must know what you are doing when using this device. I use it to clean the tartar off the sides of my dogs' teeth, but be careful. It does what it is supposed to do and the angles on end of this tartar cleaner are more effective than some of the others that I have seen."
3,works but...,It is square on the ends not round and is hard to get between teeth. Great quality though.
1,Did Not Work As I Had Hoped.,"I bought this tool with hopes that I would be able to successfully use it on at least one of my dogs. They are complete opposite sizes, one small and one very large. Both have a lot of dental tartar and build up. They are well behaved and sit very still for me to to things like this to them so that is not an issue.The first thing that I noticed when I removed it from the packaging was how sharp each end was. If your hand slips at all, this could potentially be very dangerous in your dog's mouth. Still, I carefully tried it on each of my canines but it made no difference. It was not able to chip off any of the plaque or remove any tartar and I was afraid to put too much force into it as I didn't want to damage their gums in the process.Personally, I would not recommend this tool to anyone else."
4,An epic tale of a robotic girl,"A robot named Tokiko (Key) goes to highschool in rural Japan until one day she is summoned from class to find that her grandfather has died. Having little in the way of feelings she has trouble accepting this. Although he died quickly he had time to leave a message to key, The message says that he had found a way to for her to transcend her robotic body and become human, however The process will take the friendship of at least 30,000 friends. The following day Key leaves for tokyo, she tries many things but befriends no one. After a full day she stops and runs into a photographer an then into her childhood friend Sakura. The story isn't great if your looking for a laugh but it is interesting and it will have you guessing at every turn and the music for something like this is superb And the ajo corperation is very well thought out but I'd definately recomend this to anyone who enjoys mature animes."
4,So sexy and so beautiful,"I was so excited to finally see this much anticipated and controversial Bollywood Lesbian installment. For anyone that loves big Bollywood production, then this drama for lesbians is perfect for the eye candy feast femmes. Two girls(early 20's) are roommates after college. When one goes away, the other one meets, of course, a man. The rest is up to you to see... I liked it."
3,Best movie line - You're a bloody lez,"If you are looking for a movie with oscar-winning acting, witty dialogue, and artistic cinematography, than keep looking. If you want to waste two hours of which you will never get back, this is the movie for you. I gave it three stars because the actresses weren't offensive to the eye. When you reconcile yourself to the stupid story, it's actually funny."
5,a glimpse into the artworld of the 80's,"this is a wonderful movie and a great ensamble cast.i love Claire Forlani's deadpan line ""Benny your crazy you should do more drugs""!"
3,I WILL NOT SELL YOU 'BASQUIAT'.,"But I will say this:I give it 3 and a half stars as a film and 2 stars for the depiction of Jean-Michel. While the depiction is accurate, it is only part of a much larger character."
2,Bad,"David Bowie does a great job playing Andy Warhol. He's better a actor than most full-time actors. The movie itself, though, is bad. I'm a writer, and have published a lot of fiction, and it takes time and practice to master the rules and craft of fiction. Too often someone like Schnabel comes along and thinks he can write a script without any training for fiction writing. His script has every amateur writer's mistake you can make. It's really a piece of junk. But I'm giving this two stars instead of one because of Bowie's performance."
1,Heaping pile of doo doo,"If the point of the movie was to show how sick and disoriented people become rich and famous, then the movie succeeded. However, it is difficult to enjoy the movie because you can't identify with the characters. They're just too damn bizarre."
5,Jeffrey Wright Does It Again!!!!,"Good movie about a life gone too soon. Wright does a fantastic job at his portrayal of Basquiat!! Love, love, love this movie and became a Basquiat art fan."
5,I loved this movie!,"First of all, I'd like to say, that the purpose of the surfers was Basquiat wanted so badly to go to Hawaii - and so, when you see the surfer behind the buildings, it was Basquiat daydreaming of going..He talks about going to Hawaii a few times during the movie. Anyway, i saw the movie because i'm a big fan of Benicio Del Toro, he's an incredible actor indeed, he's sooo good, so talented and so quirky. Also, the movie itself was very impressive. I thought it was well written, all the actors did a superb job and i'm probably going to purchase this movie and name it as one of my favorites. Other than that, if you love art then i'm sure you will relate as well as love it!"
4,Art/Design Student Alert,"This film is a must for all students interested in design.The use of color to communicate thought, emotion, timeand place is exquisite. Superimposed images, used throughoutthe film, give us entry to Basquiat's mind and emtotionalbeing while reality swirls around him.The rhythm and theblocking of place give rise to the form of the film. Notto be missed by any student of time based graphics.Highly recommended.Lagniappe:Through a door opened slightly, a glimpse of the New Yorkart scene can be had in all its generosity and selfishness.Characters abound and personal pocket art museums thatare studios surface.The script reflects an insider'spersonal perspective of Basquiat's story."
5,Enlightening....,"What I loved about this movie is that Jeffrey Wright showed the emotional and sensitive side of Basquiat, as well as his creative side. It showed his struggles with his personal life as it overcame his professional. The characters were so real...so human and true to life in that time. I really enjoyed this movie. It pulled me into his life....only I wish I knew more...."
4,Not a DM album but worth a listen,"This a great album by a singer of a band for 20 years were he didn't write a single song. I was expecting a rock album. I was pleasanty surprised. He voice is amazing on this album. He really does sound great. My favorites are Bottle living, I need you and Dirty sticky floors. I can't afford the import like some others but when its release here in the states I will have it. I will agree that I would have liked to see more development in the sounds. Its his first solo album and who knew he could write. I am glad he can and I hope he has a more electric album next time. Maybe evan have Alan Wilder produce wouldn't that be something. There is a lot of good material on this album. I do think its better than Martins too. Now if we could only get a new DM out."
2,not much for the money,"This video costs nearly $800 from it's producer, the qi co.The price of $500 is thus a deep discount.What they do not tell you is that it is only 60 minutes long and english in origin.In my opinion, this is a very high price for such a short video. Furthermore, british and american cultures are very different.What may be very effective in britan may not work here."
3,Haynes manual,"This is the first Haynes manual I have ever bought. It is nice and has given me answers for what I have needed. but I will go back and order Chiltons from now on though, they seem to be more complete and easier to use."
4,You will love this,"Diana Millay is a fascinating person, and would have a hard time writing anything truly boring or frivolous. Read ""Three Books of Occult Philosophy"" by Cornelius Agrippa-if you try to read it as a history book, you really miss the point. This is a book about Halloween, a book meant to be as much inspirational (at least) as it is informative. Treat it as such, and you won't be dissapointed. This is book is a great read, for kids and adults.I appreciate the criticism of the first reviewer, but I suggest he missed a lot-maybe even missed the point of the book. Would you read ""Aesop's fables"" and complain because animals actually talked in the stories? Don't be so one-dimensional! This is an interesting work by a very interesting woman. Get it while you can, it's a one of a kind."
2,Skips!!!,"I bought a few seasons, and I've made it through the fourth so far. Two or three of the episodes are completely unwatchable, because it skips so bad. Even though I bought it because the quality was ""very good,"" the case was not in great condition and the disc was CLEARLY and VISIBLY damaged. Sure enough, when I try to play it, it skips!"
3,Sex and The City 4 bought in used condition,"Cover was damaged, but user had made that known so not a surprise. However one of the discs had scratches on two episodes that made it skip a lot making a few scenes unwatchable. Other than that the other cds were perfect. Wish I would have known about the damage on the cds but arrived fast."
3,BAD 3RD DISC,I ordered seasons 1-4.....everything was very good til I was watching disc 3 of season 4..... all but 2 episodes were flawed....and sooo flawed that the screen went to black.....ugh
2,Overrated and cheated,"The episodes are great, the storylines superb. But this fourth season is packaged with reruns and almost half the episodes are repeats. Am disappointed."
2,Not the same Sex you are used to,"I have been a fan of SATC since the very first episode. After the remarkable ending to season 3, I couldn't wait for season 4. In hindsight, I wish I would have stopped watching after season 3. Season 4 used to be the worst season of Sex and the City (that is, until season 5). The show took incredible liberties with each of the 4 characters - changing nearly everything about them entirely. Samantha a lesbian? Carrie back with Aiden and spending time in the country? Miranda having a baby with Steve? The only character who stayed true to herself was Charlotte. If you liked the earlier seasons of SATC, be careful - season 4 may just ruin the entire series for you!"
2,SELFISH SAHLLOW SILLY (AND NOT THE GOOD KIND),"How old are these women supposed to be? I thought they were all over thirty, WHY then do they act like co-eds? It's embarrasing to grown-up women. The show used to be very cute and funny - in season 4 it's just nauseating. It feels as if a gay man is writing this show not an intelligent, witty woman.Carrie is the most self-centered brat I've ever met...She had an amazing man in Aidan (although maybe unrealistic) and she couldn't see past her shoes - give me a break. I thought I might be losing touch, but both men and women I talked to had the same take on her. Charlotte has definately become the most likable character.I haven't seen season 5 or 6 yet, let's hope it's better than 4!LuLu."
2,Average at best,the Show over each passing year has gotten weaker to Me.without without Mr.Big being featured more the show really suffered.I dig Kim Cattrall alot.She is a Babe.but the Show seems to Be just going through the motions much growth.
5,Perfect!!!,"This product was exactly what i wanted!! New, and now i can watch sex in the city whenever i want!!! great quality. Thanks amazon!!"
3,Background noise overpowers the characters speech,"In some instances, the actors can not be heard over the background noises and I find this to be annoying."
1,Sex and the City: The complete Fourth Season,"While the DVD and case were in good condition, as promised, it took about 2 1/2 weeks to receive the shipment. And it only had to travel across 3 states! The Pony Express could have gotten it here faster by horse! I will not order from gohastings again."
3,Sex and the City: Fragile,"I love watching Sex and the City (4th is a fun season). My only gripe is with the packaging. Worst DVD packaging ever! You can't read from the outside what episodes are in it. Also, the push tabs to extract the DVDs are really clunky. Be careful when taking them out, as the CDs do not always pop out, and can crack if you use too much pressure."
4,Great fun for any City fans,"This is simply the best so far in the boxed set series of the Sex sets. It has the best of both worlds. NOt to give any clues away, but your heroine gets the best men! Truly a must for any fan!"
1,Rent this season...don't buy it,"I LOVE the first 3 seasons of this show and bought them all, so when the 4th season came out, I bought that one too. I was so disappointed in this season! Apparently the writers ran out of ideas and they didn't stay true to the characters. Certain storylines lasted way too long, like Samantha & Richard and Charlotte and Trey (Trey should've been gone a LONG time ago!) This season was just not funny like the other 3. My favorite season was the 2nd. If you don't have HBO and you want to keep up with the show, rent this one, but save your money and don't buy it."
5,the best,If you love Sex and the City you must see this series. It's one of the funniest shows ever made.
3,Mystery/adventure sci fi,"The Solar Queen, a merchant ship, arrives for a delivery. The crew discovers a mysterious stow-away who has died during the trip, and who apparently hid a package on board. The stow-away and package are later linked to the politics of the destination planet, which contains strange mutated creatures. Animal telepathy plays a role in the story, as in other Norton novels. This is an easy, fast read and entertaining as an adventure."
1,Junk,"Had high hopes for this mount, but it's poor quality. It doesn't hold even a 20lb projector in a stable location. The mount connects to the arm with a flimsy ball and socket configuration, but does not lock in place well. I returned this to shop for an alternative."
4,this came first,"I watched this movie with my dad, and within about fifteen seconds, I said, ""wow, this feels just like Ocean's Eleven."" and he said, ""really? I was going to say Out of Sight,"" not realizing that both were directed by the same guy. So if you want to see what was almost certainly one of SS's inspirations, check this out. It's a riot. It would be hard to go wrong with William Goldman writing and Robert Redford starring, but then you add in Zero Mostel and it's just out-of-control funny. An excellent heist flick."
3,thought I found what I needed...,"... so far, no. I purchased this via Kindle to help me with _Naked Lunch_ by Burroughs. I even searched beat generation and this was the only beat-to-English dictionary I could find. So far, not a single word or phrase I've needed help with was in this book (except 'croaker' and I don't think it's right). I searched the book for ""burroughs"", because this author does cite (hooray!), but there were no references found... searched ""naked lunch"": zip. So far, not useful. I am very disappointed that it does not serve my needs. It is a neat read and I will keep it, but I was hoping for more."
4,Groovy,"This is such a fun book. The best part are the footnotes. They explain where the terms originate from (movies, novels...)I got Straight from the Fridge, because I wanted to look up ""normal"" words and find what the slang might be so I could jazz up the speech in a short story. However, the book is not set up that way. It is organized in alphabetical order for the slang term only. Despite this drawback, it is a great source and well worth the read."
3,Straight from the Fridge . . .Hipster Slang,"This book is available in both paperback and hard cover. My paperback is 190 pages. The primary advantage of this book over more formal (and better documented) slang dictionaries is that this publication includes slang phrases - ""togged to the bricks"", for example - that are bypassed by simple listings of slang words."
3,Stand by while I pad your skull,"This book is a ""reference"" guide for slang phrases used in jazz, rockabilly music, and pulp fiction/noir until about the early sixties. The phrases/terms used in the aforementioned mediums are displayed in alphabetical order, but this guide does not offer a reverse look-up; for instance, ""bottle baby"" means drunk but you can't look up drunk and find all the phrases/words in this book that mean drunk (and there are ALOT of phrases/words that mean drunk.) So for a reference guide, it sucks.Also, I would've enjoyed more of an explanation on the origins of the terms/phrases. He often references where he found the terms, but he doesn't tell you their historical or generational siginificance (although some are obvious.)Plus, this book would've gotten definite thumbs up if there were pics, but sadly, not one pic.All in all, it's a pretty unique and interesting book to pick up."
4,This book slays me!,"Decharne has collected some interesting nuggets of American slang in this book. It has also been illustrated with photos and artwork to illustrate where some of those nuggets have come from. Overall, a fun read if you're interested in the nuances of American English."
1,Don't buy Kindle version!,"Horrible formatting makes it totally unreadable! Do not waste your money or your time. Nothing else to say, but ""Reviews must contain at least 2 words..."""
5,No More Orphan Egg Yolks,"I saw this book many years ago in the library and was delighted to be able to have my own copy. Now when I want to make a souffle or meringue, I can first decide on a good way to use up the egg yolks instead of having to discard them. Thanks Amazon."
5,Hysterical.,"Fans of Kate Clinton will get a kick out this book. It is funny and insightful, just like her stand up."
2,READ OUR LIPS: ENOUGH ALREADY,"Mainstream lesbian comedian (and Provincetown resident) Kate Clinton's humor is showcased in this collection of 26 short pieces -- part stand-up routine, part essay, part schtick. Some of them are quite funny: ""Whenever a woman describes herself as 'post-feminist,' I picture women lashed to posts. Joan of Arc was an early post-feminist."" Some are mildly amusing: ""Jean Harris was an early hero of mine. Who hasn't wanted to blow away a diet doctor?"" Some are perfectly dreadful: ""When CBS sportscaster Ben Wright claimed women don't make good golfers because their boobs get in the way of things, I thought, 'Two words, Ben. Beer. Gut.'"" Once you get her started, you might want her to shut up. For a bit."
4,It just works...,What can I say about this product. Not real fancy. Just a practical cell phone cover.Does a good job of protecting your RAZR. All connections are not impeded.Great cell phone cover for the price.
4,A gripping story of survival (and Jimmy stewart in the lead),"Any film with Jimmy Stewart in a leading role is sure to be a hit and Flight of the Phoenix doesn't disappoint.A plane crash in the desert follows into a gripping two hour film of survival and hope. Led by Jimmy Stewart, the crew which include great acting talents like Richard Attenborough, Peter Finch and Ernest Borgnine courageously try to survive the desert heat, lack of water, and high tempers between crew members.When all hope of a rescue is gone, an idea by a German model plane maker, to rebuild the crashed craft, initially not taken seriously by Jimmy Stewart, is eventually seen as the only option of survival and the movie climaxes into a gripping story of team effort and a race against time to get the plane flying. This is a highly recommended film that will have you on the edge of your seat right to the end. The film got 4stars because the UK DVD lacked even the simplest extra, like a trailer."
5,Fantastic Movie,"My favorite kind of story is about a group of brave, intelligent, resourceful men facing a crisis and working together to get out of it. This film is a classic of this genre. Jimmy Stewart, who plays the pilot, was a real bomber pilot in World War II who flew missions over Nazi Germany in which there was a high risk of being shot down so no one is better qualified to perform in a role like this. If you like films like Apollo 13, The Great Escape or Memphis Belle then you can't miss this one!"
1,Warning: Package contains mutilated work of art!,"This version was made from a full screen version where the left and right sides were sliced off. Then the tops and bottoms were sliced off so the image would fit a modern 16:9 monitor. What you see is a small rectangle cut out of the center of the original movie.The first clue was that the familiar 20th Century Fox logo was cut off on all four sides. When the actors came on screen, it looked like every shot was a closeup. Lots of giant faces, like how they used to shoot TV shows. The effect is gruesome. Watching this version is most unsettling. I could not stand to watch for more than about ten minutes.The package says ""widescreen edition"". Maybe it's time for legislation to define terms, because this labeling should be illegal. All copies of this version should be destroyed.I hope they release a genuine version of this terrific movie."
5,How about a restored DVD of this with lots of extras?,This is one of my all time favorite movies. I would love to see someone clean it up and restore it with all the extras for a DVD. How about it Hollywood? I am sure there are many other fans of this movie and the actors in it who are just waiting to see it released on DVD.
4,Something is missing,The overall story is extremely good as are the actors. However somewhere I don't think that the tensions of this small group of men fighting to survive comes though 100%. That spark often was missing. Some of the acting was extremely wooden.However it certainly is an above average movie.
3,No Spoiler Here,"Some of these reviews give information that, I feel, should be kept unstated because it ruins part of the movie if you know it ahead of time. As for the movie rating itself, while this is not my type of movie, I did enjoy it for the most part. I felt it was too long, spent way too much time showing them putting the plane together (by the end of the movie, I felt I'd learned how to build a plane) and there were some parts I felt weren't necessary for the plot, but for the most part, it was a good movie for it's time."
1,Disappointing,"Being a Jimmy Stewart fan and having read the other online reviews, I purchased this DVD. I was disappointed mostly because of the language and the ""fantasy"" scene that one of the men experienced. It may have been more realistic to have that stuff in a movie of men in a plane crash, but I didn't appreciate it and wish I had been aware of that before I bought it. In my opinion, the story wasn't as good as other James Stewart films."
4,Great survival-adventure!,"A diverse group of men brought to a precarious situation, far from aid, no hope in sight, mental faculties failing along with their bodies . . . irresistable stuff!DVD has no extras other than a theatrical trailer, but that's OK - this is entertainment, not egghead material. Great to see it in widescreen finally, plus a clear, sharp print, clean sound.Read the book if you can find it - it does a fantastic job of putting you out there in the middle of nowhere, feeling the mounting desparation and dwindling reserves, even moreso than the film."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An engaging adventure that is better in almost every way than its more modern remake, The Flight of the Phoenix makes the most out of its interesting premise and desert setting; with a cast of top-flight character actors behind the somewhat-annoying Jimmy Stewart, it's a worthy film."
3,Not's Stewart's Best Acting,"Watchable film with a good story and inspiring ending, but marred by overacting and b-movie music score that is more obvious as the film shows its age. I loved it as a kid, but have to say not so much as an adult. The making of the movie was tragic as a stunt pilot (Mantz) died in a crash. (Note the movie has a tribute note to him in the credits.) The cast was impressive but doesn't always deliver because of the almost forced over the top acting, so makes you wonder about how much better it might have been with a less melodrama director."
2,worked fine about 4 months,"then it just blow!!, that's it , no more to say about it. I think better invest ina more robust one"
1,Please.,"The Cantos of Ezra Pound are not ""the most important literary work ever"" or some other such nonesense. Essentially they amount to a man, steadily losing his sanity(notice that the cantos become increasingly fragmented the longer the poem gets) who was spouting a lot of crackpot political and economic theories via incomprehensible poetry. And his readers weren't the only ones to whom the Cantos are incomprehensible:Pound himself didn't know the meanings of most of the Ideograms that are spewed throughout the poem. This is not an ""acheivement"" or ""an indictment of our society"" or a ""brilliant satire""(to utilize some of the favorite phrases of readers of pretentious, incoherent, and ultimately meaningless literature), it's just drivel. Not that Pound was a horrible poet-some of his early writing is actually quite good. If you're going to read any Pound, read ""Personae"""
1,Good luck....,"with this drivel. I can't remember ever reading anyone who used so many words to say so little. If Pound should be credited with anything it should be that he could be looked upon as father of the beatnik generation where you could spew out any blend of flowery language and then lavish yourself with praise.Sorry but if you think this blather is the greatest poetry ever written then you need psychiatric help. If you ever wonder how radicals are created then read this garbage. It's always easy to be looked upon as a genius when the critics are radicals like yourself. Pound has said that America is an insane asylum and if that were so, he would be our most famous inmate. What a nut."
1,Pound sucks,"No one person has done greater damage to the English language and its literature than Ezra Pound. After being mistakenly hailed by T.S.Eliot (a great poet) the works of Pound have been taken as a licence for thousands of mediocrities to gush their meaningless tosh all over the rest of us, get worshipped for their esoteric genius, when in fact they are just lazy, sloppy, selfish, regurgitators of rubbish. Language was invented so that people could communicate with each other, and make sense of what the other person was saying. Pound kicked into the 20th century full of sound and fury, signifying nothing, since he had nothing to say, and was in fact a kind of mental and spiritual dyslexic. Still, that certainly qualifies him to represent the 20th century Zeitgeist."
3,This video could be shorter,This video has way too many breaks in it. All of the information is broken down into too many small bite size pieces. I hope the team at Dance Crazy will redo this with an updated product and not have so many 'cuts' to each segment.
4,Popcorn Kitchen Towel Set,"The towels are very nice. I do wish they were a bit thicker. The size is absolutely perfect. They are definitely worth the price. Just beware they are not very thick. Fine for drying a small sinkfull of dishes, but not much more. For a hand towel in the kitchen they are perfect."
4,Good for drying hands in kitchen,"Yeah, these are just kitchen towels, but they are great kitchen towels. If you use a dish washer or dry rack, and are just looking for towels to dry your hands (and the occasional dish) with, these are perfect. They hold up very well in the wash (no shrinking ends or loose threads), look great hanging in the kitchen, and are very soft."
4,Nice Towels,-Nice color and style-absorbent-Good for everyday use - not too thin and not too thick-Washes OK-Seems to be holding up wellJust an overall nice towel set.
2,Kitchen towels,"I ordered the same towels and was very happy with them so I ordered more - this order is the ""more"". These towels were much smaller. I don't believe it is ethical for a vendor to offer the same product under the same picture and order number and switch the delivered item. Very unhappy with this business practice."
2,product quality,"I've had the Bardwil dish towels previously and have been very happy with the quality. I ordered 2 three piece sets recently from amazon and received 2 different color variations. Not the end of the world, but definitely not as advertised. I threw them all in the wash before using them. The stitching on one side of one of the towels came completely undone and ruined the towel. The towels on a whole are thinner and less plush than the ones purchased at Macy's."
3,Somewhat disappointed,The patterns received were not the same as displayed. Two were of the same instead of three different as advertised. This was misleading to buyers.
5,great towels,these towels are very absorbent and the color is bright even after numerous washings. an excellent buy. thanks Amazon!
4,A little bit fuzzy,I like the towels but they put of a little bit of cotton fuzz. Maybe it'll go away after they're washed a few more times.
2,okay dish towels,"How rhapsodic can one get about dish towels? These dishtowels are just okay. After using them, I've decided I much prefer smooth, tight woven towels to the 'popcorn' texture."
2,Towels,"Popcorn 3-Piece Kitchen Towel Set, RedThese towels are nice-looking, but I won't buy them again. I use them as kitchen hand towels, and they aren't as thick as I would like. The red towel faded a bit in the first washing."
4,Great Towels!,"Good towels, especially for the price. Pretty colors. Goes well in my country blue accented kitchen. Good quality - thick and big. Only downside is that one of them has had some loose threads on the seam. Still, would definitey buy again."
4,Very nice ..,Look nice...have not used yet. Might give as a gift. I assume the other reviews do it justice. I have faith in you people.UPDATE....very nice.
3,"Good, not very absorbent","These are decent towels for the price. I use these for drying my hands and large pots & pans. I've found the towels are not very absorbent, perhaps due to the fabric pattern. The black one easily shows crumbs and other dirt."
4,Great Bargain AND Cute Too!,"Cooking more at home makes me want the kitchen to be a pleasant place since I'm in it more :) I purchased two sets of these towels to replace the others I've had for years. I'm sure these will last as long if not longer. They're durable, cute and do the job at a good price. I'm sold!"
2,Disappointing,After the rave reviews I had high hopes for these towels. I ordered two sets and have been very diappointed. I thought after a few washings they would be more absorbant. They are not. They just move the water around on the counter. I would not recommend these towels. I will probably buy bathroom handtowels next time.
3,"Good for drying hands, but not for drying dishes","These towels are really absorbent and work well for drying your hands. They are also thick enough to make great pot holders. I don't like them for drying dishes though. The set I got was black and white and even the one with just a little bit of black in it leaves black fibers all over the dishes. I also have a set of flour sack dish towels, and those never leave fibers on the dishes. I can't stand having the little fibers all over my dishes. If you are looking for something to dry your hands on and use as a pot holder these are great, but if you want to actually dry your dishes try something else."
1,Kitchen Towels Nonabsorbent,"The purpose of a towel is to absorb water. These towels just glide over the water. They are advertised as ""cotton."" If these towels are cotton, they must have a Teflon coating."
4,Great Value!,"For $10, I feared these would arrive and be less than great. But, I took the chance, based on reviews, and glad I did. They ARE great value. Highly recommended."
5,Great towels for the money.,"I bought these when they were priced at $5.99 w/free delivery but I think they are worth even full price. They are absorbent, durable and come in a good range of colors that match up well to my kitchen."
5,Kitchen towel set,"This is a great product for the price. I like them so much, I will probably order some more. They are a little larger than the standard size you might buy at a grocery store."
5,nice shoe,good quality and comfortable. the most important thing is the blue color comes out great look.
1,Don't Buy,"This MP3 player will work well for a while (except for headphones which will suck from the very beginning). But after a while it won't turn on and there won't be anything you can do about it. This happened to me, and the same thing happened to a friend who warned me about the problem a little too late. Coby customer service is also bad, and returning it wasn't an option for me as the warranty is up after just 90 days. Maybe they don't expect it to last much longer than that, or maybe they just hope it won't malfunction before then. Either way, the length of the warranty isn't that good a sign. I give it one star because Amazon won't seem to let me give it none."
4,Buena relacón precio/valor.,"Buen reproductor mp3/wma, tiene radio, se puede utilizar como grabador, el display viene en vario tonos de colores, el volumen no es muy alto pero se escucha bien, trae cd de controlador, manual de usuario, la tapa queda un poco floja, trae audifonos y batería. Buen producto para los que por primera vez quieran tener un reproductor de mp3 portatil."
2,Mediocre Egyptologists Review,"It takes a few attempts to get through this book. I read it through about 3 times before I could understand what the authors point was. It is more of a documentary then anything else. Perhaps he could have ellaborated on the myths and ledgends, as well as zodiac references to the pyramids. Other than that, it's an interesting read."
4,Belkin Pre-N 170262 rounter,"Router has worked great for years until Vista where I've discovered the problem with uploading a large number of jpeg files to Kodak's ofoto. Router locks up and I have to reboot or unplug it. I think I'll re-install XP, Vista seems to be a dog in many ways."
1,"Nothing good to say, unfortunately","Unlike most of the other posters, this desktop card would not work in my PC. I have a fairly new 1-year old PC that has the 32-bit PCI slots required by this card. It recognized the cardbus adapter and the NIC with no problem - but I can't get to connected to anything at all. The card does not see any network - nothing.One thing to note is that, unlike most other people, I did not buy this with the Pre-N router. The card is supposed to work with non-PreN hardware but it did not work with my Linksys WRT54G. I called Belkin and the tech support was downright horrible. The tech, who barely spoke english, gave me such useful advice as getting off the cordless phone (was on a corded phone), moving the PC closer to the router (was 20 feet away), and updating the drivers (already done). When I explained all that was done, I got hung up on. Nice, huh?In short - I am returning this, and buying something else :( what a waste of time."
1,Fed up with Bait and Switch,"Even though this network card works amazingly well when everything is configured properly and it's a great bargain, Belkin is doing everything within its power to make you buy the N card and router instead. The day the Belkin N router was introduced at my local Staples and Bestbuy stores last year, the Pre-N cards and router mysteriously disappeared from the shelves and no one could explain why. Now Vista has been out for months, yet Belkin is still unable/unwilling to deliver Vista compatible drivers for most of the older Pre-N cards. All you get is a ""coming soon"" note on their web site with the implied message that they hope you run out of patience with your old, useless Pre-N network card and upgrade to N."
4,J.Lovell's problem solved,"I know J.Lovell returned the card because of the message -""The device Ricoh R5C520 Carbus Adapter has detected a CardBus card in its slot, but the firmware on this system is not configured to allow the CardBus controller to be run in CardBus mode. The operating system will currently accept only 16-bit (R2) pc-cards on this controller.""We had the same problem and message from XP - it was caused by the BIOS of the host Gateway PC not being uptodate. After a flash update of the BIOS from Gateway the card worked OK. So I guess that was J.Lovell's problem as well.We solved it ourselves - Belkin responded to emails but did not have a solution."
3,"Great with XP for 3 Years, but...","I bought this Pre-N Desktop Network Card several years ago and had no problems with it in conjunction with the Belkin pre-n router and then when this desktop PC was physically moved to work with an older g non-Belkin router. However, when I updated the crashed PC with the FSD8000 in it, I discovered that it wasn't going to work with the newly installed Windows 7! Although a couple of reviews here say they have been able to get it to work with Vista, Belkin says it will not and that means Win 7 support ""ain't"" likely. I'm now considering installing a dual boot XP & Win 7 simply to use the internet without having to invest in more hardware (the PC is not close to a hardwire connection). I certainly wish there was some work-around/hack to get it to work with post-XP systems..."
1,Still no Vista support?,"I can not believe that almost a year later and still no Vista support. On their support site it still just says Coming Soon! What a joke and a waste of time and money.I have the Pre-N router and am happy with that, and had hoped to get the maximum performance out of it by using the network card made to use with the router. Boy, am I dissapointed."
1,Not Vista Compatible,"I was disappointed to learn this card won't work with Windows Vista. I bought the router + card together in hopes of getting broader coverage even though it isn't fully standards-compliant (""Pre-N""). I contacted support about the issue and they sent me instructions that didn't work out. Might be a good product for WindowsXP, but for my purposes I rate it 1 star."
4,Upgrading,Well when dot net first came along I more or less refused to upgrade until I saw a stable platform. I have finally upgraded... not sure if it is all that stable but I will say upgrading from VB 6 my application development time has just about been cut in half and I can very impressive looking interfaces. Overall I would say I am happy with the purchase.
3,Not bad but not great either,"this is the one gaiman/mckean work that had escaped my collection until recently and to tell the truth I was a bit disappointed. the artwork is excellent (mckean always is excellent) but not as inventive as his later work. and I think gaiman definitely is way too political in this book. his blatant statements about the environment are nothing short of spelled out. As far as putting in other DC Universe characters; I , for one, expect more creativity from Gaiman. The cameos were too simple and didn't really add to the story. More a marketing ploy really, I think.this is a fine piece of work, but I would suggest others by gaiman such as: anything from the sandman series, violent cases, angels and visitations or neverwhere. on the mckean side I would suggest cages or arkham asylum."
5,Going Down. . .,One thing is Certain. . .This was one of Dave Mckean's most beautifully illustrated works for DC. Very similar to his work on the Arkham Asylum Graphic Novel. Yes...Gaiman's writing was top notch too. And I loved the way he brought in cameo appearences of other DC characters. You don't have to be familiar with the DC universe to read this though. The story is strange and wonderful.
3,Passable,"Love the artwork, but every time I read this, I just end up scratching my head. It wanders, and just doesn't get anythig interesting done. None of the sweep and scope that you expect from Gaiman.The world itself is not terribly cohesive either. It seems part Daredevil, but it isn't really. It's certainly not Sandman, or anything like that.It's just a story. Worth buying, perhaps, for completeness sake.Hardly worth reading."
2,torn cover,Book came with a tear about 3cm long on the back near the binding. Apart from that it was as described.
2,Everyone Has To Start Somewhere,"As a big fan of Neil Gaiman's novels and Sandman series, I was truly looking forward to this. Of course, as seen in the early issues of Sandman, Gaiman wasn't a natural at writing comics (but, then again, who is?) and he needed a bit of time to develope his ""sea legs"" so to speak. As such, this work of his was a little weak, nowhere near on par with his later efforts in works such as Mr. Punch, American Gods, The Books of Magic, Neverwhere (the novel), and, of course, Sandman.Dave McKean's artwork, though, is always a treat, so I should point out my review is focused more on Gaiman's writing for this rather than McKean's artwork."
5,Beautiful and compelling,"I was introduced to Black Orchid in the late 1980's by a college friend. I was captivated by the beautiful artwork, so unlike any other comic or graphic novel I'd ever seen. As I read the story, one of Neil Gaimen's earlier offerings, I was equally drawn in. From the moment I finished this I became an immediate and lasting fan of both Gaimen and McKean's work."
3,Gaiman's done better,"First, the good news. McKean's art is a real asset. It's varied, skilled, and very expressive.The story just didn't work for me, though. It was a little too close to the super-hero-in-spandex genre, with character crossovers from Superman, Batman, and I don't know what all else. There's a market for SHIS stories, but I'm not in it.Gaiman's done some incredible work. He's set a standard for thoughtful, unusual characters and settings. The problem is, he set the standard so high that not even he can reach that mark every time. I really expected something more mature from Gaiman and McKean - maybe next time."
3,Ok for the cheap price.,This item arrived in good shape and it does the job it is designed to do but it is nothing more than a styrofoam ball with reflective pieces glued all over it. Maybe I am not a disco/mirror ball expert. Looks cheap to me.
4,Good movie but it omits George Mallory,"How can this movie omit the story of George Mallory? Ok, it is called 50 years and not 70 or 80 but still it seems odd. Otherwise it is well shot and a worthy purchase and or rental. Good imagery. I would say anyone who likes movies like ""The Wildest Dream"" or ""Touching the Void"" would appreciate this one as well."
4,Great documentary,This was an excellent documentary about Everest and the history of those who tried to climb it as well as the countries these men and women represented. The only thing that would have made this documentary better would be for it to have included more information about their gear and the cost of getting to and from base camp and the like.
4,Another one for the collection,"I have 7 Everest DVD's and this one is towards the top of the list. Very enjoyable and pretty well written/scripted, and the historical side of the story is educational too. Basically, a fairly solid and more than satisfactory documentary as one would expect from National Geographic. If you plan to choose an Everest DVD for family viewing then this is, in my opinion, the one to get. Some of the others are either too technical or scary for younger family members."
4,A good quick read,"This is not really a book about zen in the traditional sense or a comprehensive study of the martial arts, but rather it's about the author's experiences while studying martial arts. The book is composed of many short chapters, each covering an insight attained or lesson that the author learned in the martial arts. Some insights are easily applicable outside of the dojo while others require a bit stretching to be useful in everyday life. Though this is an entertaining read with sprinkles of wisdom throughout, it's more anecdotal than how-to. After reading you might feel like you've understand a little more about certain zen aspect in the martial arts and life, but you won't necessarily be given clear instruction on how to reach that state of being. If you like zen, Eastern culture, or the martial life then you'll definitely enjoy this book, just don't expect it to turn you into a warrior sage or anything."
2,there are much better books out there,"i was fairly interested in this book when i got it but after reading it i was left with the sense that i should have read something else. the book isn't bad, it just didn't give me any insight in regard to the title. it was a quick read and didn't bore me but i felt no new ideas about Zen or the martial arts were gained. if you want to understand Zen better read D.T. Suzuki and Eugen Herrigel gives a great account of Zen as it relates to training. for martial arts there are far better books. this book was a huge disappointment for insight into martial arts and i was left with the sense that while Hyams has certainly trained in a vast array of disciplines his understanding does not go beyond the surface of any of them. one thing this book may be good for is that there are numerous quotes from other books, some of which i have read, and i would recommended reading some of the books he quotes instead of this one."
2,That's all fine and well but...,"I think i would be far more impressed with this book if Mr. Hyams had internalized anything he wrote about. I have nothing against the author personally, but i also see no obligation to diefy someone who does not hold true to his writings"
1,"""name-dropping and ego filling""","Unbelievably shallow. As one of the reviewers has put it: ""just name-dropping and ego filling."" There are much better books on the subject: ""Zen and Japanase Culture"" by Suzuki, ""Zen in the Art of Archery"" by Herrigel, ""The Zen Way to the Martial Arts"" by Deshimaru."
1,Are you kidding?,"I can't understand how anyone could give this book a good review. It's nothing more than a series two page explanation of some very difficult concepts, and most of the explanations are either slightly off or just plain wrong. The author makes it sound like all you need is for someone to explain what Mushin means and ""poof"" you can now attain ""no mind"". It doesn't work thatway folks. His anecdotes are ridiculous! I especially like the one where he is told that pain doesn't hurt if you simply put your mind elsewhere, and then he claims to have simply performed this feat next time has oral surgery. LOL...right! People that can pull off this kind of feat work at it for years. It doesn't just happen! I happen to be a big believer in the Zen/Martial arts connection. That's why I bought this book. The mental aspects of the martial arts are every bit as important as the physical ones. But read something instead like ""The Zen Way to the Martial Arts"", which is a much better book IMHO."
1,You've got to be kidding?!,"Where did all the 5 star reviews come from? This book is little more than an egotistic, self promoting, shallow piece of tripe. Joe Hyams is no maritial artist, no Zen Roshi, and a nobody. Much better to buy 'The Zen Way to the Martial Arts' or 'Zen and the Art of Archery'."
5,"Perfect for the martial artist or just your average ""Joe"".","This is the perfect book to carry around with you whenever you have the chance to read it.It is a relatively small book, with enlightening short stories that teach their own important life lessons. I found it to be invaluable to my own personal development as a martial artist and as a person. And for the price, it is definitely worth buying! You will get way more than its worth."
5,Favorite Zen Book,"After reading two books on Zen, I was confused and frustrated. This book really helped me understand certain concepts because I can relate to the author's experiences. I used this book as a primer and it helped me grasp ideas from other authors."
5,Intriguing Introduction to Zen,"I checked this book out from the library with the intention of only reading a few chapters. I could not put this book down and recently purchased a copy of my own. I was not familiar with the concept of zen before reading this book. Since then, it has fueled my curiosity to seek out other, more in-depth books on the subject. The book itself is very well written and contains beautiful photographs. The book technically discusses zen as seen through the martial arts, but one does not need to be a martial artist to enjoy the text. Hyams gives us important life lessons as taught to him by Bruce Lee and other masters of the martial arts. So, here, I will sum it up for you in one sentence: Zen in the Martial Arts is a simple, yet intriguing fast read that could lay the foundation in changing your life."
4,A very good read.,"I really enjoyed this book.I originally bought this book because I just recently had gotten into martial arts and I thought that this book would help give me a cool mindset during my training and I thought it would probably help me with my anger problem,and it did.It was a very good book."
4,Zen,This book was an easy read and very interesting. Could not stop reading once I started. While not an indepth book about Zen yet one man's journey through the martial arts and realization that there is more to the art than technical ability. A great intro book for Zen. The stories were great as well.
5,Life changing,"You can re-read this book over and over again and learn something new each time. The lessons are simple, but hold such meaning that can be applied to not only the martial arts, but every aspect of work, home, family & life. If you live on this planet, this is a MUST READ book. From those who have read it to those who have yet to, ""Empty your cup""."
4,The Way of...,"ZEN IN THE MARTIAL ARTS is one of the more seminal ""Zen in the Art of...""-type titles. Karateka Joe Hyams (FKA Mr. Elke Sommer) is a martial arts generalist who studied under, among many others, Bruce Lee.Within the covers of this slim volume, Hyams' approach to Zen seems a bit haphazard and informal. Although epigrams from various Zen masters pepper the pages, Hyams seems to have only the most limited grasp of structured Zen practice, such as koans and shikantaza.Hyams' exposure to Zen seems to have occurred less in the zendo than in the dojo, a fact which does not detract from the pragmatic lessons he illustrates but does give the reader a foreshortened view of Zen as a way of life. But Hyams does provide a path to understanding Zen as the critical underpinning of the serious study of any martial art.Hyams shows us that Zen imbues the martial arts with a deeper philosophical meaning, so that what would otherwise be just a way to war becomes a just warrior's way."
4,Wonderful Quick Read,This book is a great read. The author is a regular guy - living the Martial Way.
5,Don't think twice...BUY THIS BOOK NOW!,"This is an excellent book for anyone at ANY stage in martial arts. If your a master of the art or someone with an interest in it, you will find Zen in the Martial Arts to be an amazing book. You will certainly find it is well worth ten times its value in the key insights and helpful philosophies within it. I am almost certain you will find yourself re-reading it many times over as I have. Don't wait..get it now! You will not be disappointed."
3,"An OK read, but don't buy the hardcover...","I read a few pages of this book at my dojo and became a little intrigued, so I ordered it when I got home. After reading the whole thing, I will admit that there are some gems of wisdom hidden among vast amounts of name dropping and self promotion that lace the pages. Apparently Mr. Hyams studied martial arts for many years and was fortunate to meet and train with people who would eventually be considered pillars in the history of martial arts in the USA. He learned some worthy lessons from them, but takes you through a lotta hoopla before he tells you what those lessons are. I recommend buying the book used or in paperback. Its not worth the price of hardcover -if its even in hardcover."
5,My favorite martial arts book,I am instructor with over fifteen years experience and I give this my junior students at Christmas. It's required reading for my adult students. I love this book.
5,Quite a Jam Session,"Jazz Giants: Quite a jam session. Six musicians in high energy live recording that at times sound more like a big band than a sextet. Hank Jones on piano, Keter Betts on Bass, Don Menza-Tenor Sax, Buddy DeFranco on Clarinet and Conte Candoli on trumpet, and 71 minutes of great jazz. Recorded at the 1989 International Jazz Festival in Berne, Switzerland. All 6 titles are over 10 minutes long providing ample opportunity for fiery solos from all the performers. Threesome shuffe includes several alternating solos from Bellson, DeFranco, and Candoli. Excellent recording quality, almost like being there."
4,A Beautiful Song,"After several years raising her family, Nancy began recording in Japan mastering the newer technology. ""I'll Be A Song"" is notable for the title song, as well as ""Casablanca"", but the crowning star in this collection is ""The Island"". Nancy sings it with raw passion, her voice rising geometrically to create planes which lead to a a climaxing crescendo. It is a masterpiece. Think of Cubism in painting. Think of Marcel Duchamp's ""Nude Descending a Staircase"" only upward. Compare and contrast with her other recordings. Buy it! My apologies: I should have rated this CD five stars."
1,durable,"very strong clasp,I have 2 Jack Russels, and these collars are very strong works very well with my dogs"
4,I absolutely adore this movie,"I saw this movie for at least the third time today and I told myself: go ahead and get this on DVD because you watch it every time it comes on TV. Well, I just simply must have it near me. I love the ""how do you like them apples"" part in the movie. What a move! I love every minute of this movie. It is like a short story! I love the dialogue! Watch it people!"
5,Talk about corporate climbing!!!!,Great movie depicting the corporate rush to the top. Expert acting from all performers. Great entertainment...and lets face itwe all love watching Newman!
5,From The Terrace,"I love this movie. It is a wonderful love story. As always, Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward are fantastic. I've seen it about 5 0r 6 times and no doubt will see it many more times. It's one of those movies you just don't get tired of. It's G-R-R-R-REAT!!!!!!"
4,Paul & Joanne at there Best!,I love this movie. I have seen it several times and that is what I do when I like a movie. I am not tired of this one.Paul Newman is at one of his best in the feature. Joanne is a awesome actress & when teamed up with her husband WOW.I enjoyed From The Terrace and highly recommend this movie as a must see (especially for a woman).
5,from the terrace,"great movie..big fan of early paul newman..this movie holds you from minute one,showing the frailties of the characters and the slow return to his values of paul..."
4,From The Terrace,For rail buffs this movie has some fascinating railroad scenes. The opening scene says Philadelphia 1946 . The scene was actually filmed at the Central RR of NJ Jersey City Terminal. There are views of Reading RR steam engine 2124 arriving at Jersey City. This large T-1 steam engine was used on the Reading RR Iron Horse rambles steam fan trips around the time of the filming. The engine was too large to fit through the trainshed at Reading's Philadelphia terminal but it could fit into Jersey City Terminal so this section of the movie was filmed there. The late rail photographer Don Wood was at Jersey City Terminal during the filming and gave me some nice photos of Myrna Loy and Joanne Woodward posed on front of Reading Steam engine 2124 and the two actresses meeting with Reading RR PR people. There are some other train scenes throughout the movie with a different locomotive at different locations. I like the movie it reminded me of the classic movie The Best Years of Our Lives.
4,Damn....,"Hey Rudies all around! I have to say that I agree wholeheartedly with the ""Bearclaw"". (Wow! Someone else knows the ""Onion"" Song! Although I'm not surprised it's him.) This album is definitely worth owning. It's a fabulous addition to any ska lover's collection. The album is tight and has a more ""grown-up"" sound. The only thing that could have made it better would have been seeing it live in Japan."
5,Great Gift for those who love Germany,We bought Visions of Germany (2 DVD's) for my father-in-law as a Father's Day Gift. He loves anything to do with Germany and we were looking for something different that he would enjoy. He couldn't wait to watch them and he absolutely LOVED it!
2,disappointing: labels truncated,"Love the shows for the beautiful aerial shots and wonderful background music. However, the Germany Bavaria DVD has the location titles at lower left cut off, e.g., instead of seeing the label ""Bodensee"", only ""ensee"" appears, and so on, for all the town names and sights. It's not a problem with our TV: we cycled through every possible viewing format (wide, zoom, wide zoom, full, etc) and none would allow for the complete labels to appear. It seems that when the DVD was made, the picture aspect ratio was made too narrow; the package indicates it's 16:9 widescreen but it sure doesn't appear to be. If we had known this before ordering, we probably would not have bought it, as part of the enjoyment is knowing what you're seeing. We rated it 2 stars instead of 0 because of the beautiful photography but in our opinion, the disk is defective. We haven't watched the Rhine disk yet."
3,A little disappointment compared with my other Visions DVD,"I was a little bit disappointed when I watch these. It seems like Germany does not have as beautiful a scenary as that of France or Englnad. But I knew this is not true when I watched other travel DVD. Let's put it this way: When I watched the Visions of England, France, Scottland, I can feel the distinct difference in each country and their beauty and was grateful for the hellicoper views of those coutires. I had a hard time to even finish the first DVD. After viewing the first one, I lost interest to watch the second one."
3,Homeland,"Germany from above is better, but I have not been able to find it in English. So this was 'in lieu' of, but I would prefer the other."
5,Vision of Germany,"Great video with helicopter perspectives on many grand sights of Germany from the Rhine Valley to Bavaris. Even if you have seen the various places, the aerial orientation will privide fresh perspective."
3,Not HD,"Although the DVD is wonderfully shot, it is NOT in High Definition, and because it is in widescreen, I presumed it was. Moral: never presume."
1,Never received,"I was greatly looking forward to this item, but it never showed up. I did get a credit on my account, but I'd rather have had the item sent and the money accepted. Now I have to look elsewhere."
3,The other Larks...,"Not the Larks who had the hit with ""The Jerk"", but the Philadelphia-based Weldon McDougal group. Basically, a minor one-hit wonder, this group scored only with ""It's Unbelievable"" in 1961. With the turnover of group members, the lack of marketable material and little promotional power behind them, there was little daylight seen by this group's output after their first hit. The disc contains the title hit plus a number of non-charted sides and alternate versions.Sound quality varies considerably as the source material was a mix of master tapes and vinyl, some of it fairly well worn. A few tracks (10,11,12,17) are in stereo, having been remixed from the original session tapes. Unfortunately, the flagship song is a fairly noisy disc dub so there is little improvement sonically over other available sources for this song.While mostly of interest to collectors, this new collection does offer fans a retrospective of this early rock-era Pennsylvania vocal group's recordings."
3,"Not THOSE Larks but pretty good,nonetheless","I was unfamiliar with this group.Of course the real Larks, featured the great Eugene Mumford(""My Reverie"",""I`ll live true to you"")This group wanders too casually into mid-sixties type Soul-rock that doesn`t really work too well for them. However I found two small gems on this collection: ""There Is A Girl"" and""Heaven Only Knows"",two rare and excellent offerings!"
5,Outstanding,"This is the last of a trilogy for young people that is exciting, adventurous, and thoroughly different: each book is an introduction to another land, another culture, another set of beliefs and religions, all seen through the eyes of a couple of curious and brave teenagers. Exceptional!"
3,Hope the 3rd one is better!,"This was a much faster read than the first Alexander Cold book, probably because it has substantially less content.It idolizes the isolated parts of the world and demonizes capitalists (with a gently pointed caricature of a certain software billionaire). It reveres mysticism at the expense of logic, and involves a ridiculously convoluted plot among the bad guys.I'll keep reading them, since I'm 2/3 of the way through the trilogy, but would not recommend this volume. Here's hoping book 3 is better!"
1,Allende Trilogy,"I loved this book on tape and its two companion stories. I've always been a fan of Isabel Allende and listened to Daughter of Fortune and Portrait in Sepia in the car. Then Id purchased Kingdom of the Golden Dragon and the the two other books in this series on tape. I really enjoyed them although they are very different from Allende's other books. I imagine that a 10-13 year old child would really enjoy these books and have set them aside to give as a gift to a special young person in the future. Despite the more simple story line I loved the tapes and couldn't wait to get back in the car to listen. Books-on-tape are, I think, the complete answer to road rage. When I'm listening to something good I don't care how long it takes to get where I'm going."
1,Has a freaky attitude,"Isabel Allende's ""Kingdom of the Golden Dragon"" seems like a cool book at first. It has a village of yetis, indomitable Buddhist monks, and a talking statue made out of gold. Though her writing drags, she has some good ideas.But she really puts out some weird and disturbing ideas as well. Allende seems to have a problem with Americans in general. Her ideal 'Forbidden Kingdom' is a benevolent dictatorship, where the king gets to tell people how to dress, restricts what Western influences they get to see, and generally controls their lives according to his whims. The sheep like subjects all like that. And this is shown as a good thing. Call me a materialistic, soulless Westerner, as I'm sure Allende would, but I call that a lack of freedom and rights.Who knows why Allende doesn't think much of Americans. But it's weird that she puts forward an ideal civilization that is far from ideal. And unfortunately, the Forbidden Kingdom wrecks the rest of the book."
4,Congratulations!,"I'm disapointed...disapointed that I'm almost at the end of ""Someone To Love""!!! I like the quick pace, interesting storyline. Congratulations!"
4,A Book Club Must Read!,"""Someone To love"" is a story about the marriage (and I use that term loosely)of Terry and Stephanie Collins. This relationship is full of disrespect,distrust,lies, betrayal, deception, Terry's need to control Stephanie, and Stephanie's inability to parent her children, all because of something in her past. This story has all the ingredients of a good novel, and the contents for a rousing book club discussion.My book club decided to read this book after meeting the author at a book signing. She promised us a good novel and we was not disappointed. The only thing we ask is that when the sequel is done that we be notified immediately!Thank you Karoline for delivering on your promises...all of them!Freda W""The Elegant Reading ladies Of Rockland County"""
1,SNOOZE-FEST ALERT!,"I think the only alien Mr. Tyler (the main character woman) saw was herself in the mirror. I mean if you shave her head bald, doesn't she look like an alien herself? I'm not talking about Milla Jovovich that portrayed Tyler, I'm talking about the lady herself.Anyhow, I was bored to death and in general I'm not too crazy on the alien idea. I'm pretty sure they're out there, I'm just not as fascinated about them. I mean what is more scarier, a creep dead Japanese demon chick ghost or a green/rainbow colored alien. I'm just messing, but yeah this movie bored me and I really felt like I wasted my life (more than usual) watching this."
2,Waste of viewing time,This movie was not what I thought it would be. I didnt like the way the movie kept jumping around from person to person... waste of money and time
4,Alien Abduction,"If you're looking for proof that alien abduction is and has been a REAL THING, forget it. If you're looking for a movie that makes it seem like alien abduction has finally been discovered as the real thing, you might enjoy this movie. The movie is filmed as if it's switching between scenes with actors from the movie and scenes of actual psychiatric sessions of patients who have been hypnotized and go through the buried memories of their abductions by aliens. In the genre of exciting sci-fi, this is an enjoyable movie, but don't watch it expecting to find ""the truth out there."""
3,The Fourth Kind,"After doing a little research, it appears that the original video segments were faked. In many different scenes that they were re-enacting, they did not even try to make clothes, furniture etc. look the same. This takes away from a very real problem in our society. Alien abductions are not new, and it is disappointing that they took something which was probably real and tried to discredit it by faking old video footage. Having been around UFO investigators since I was a kid, the story is probably true.As our government has done so many times in the past, tell the truth by doing it in such a fraudulent way as to discredit the truth. I believe this is the case. If you look past the fact that they tried to make it look false, therefore blurring the truth, then there is much good information there. Look to your gut for truth. Something did happen, and I would not have put these encounters past Marduk or Enlil."
3,Decent.,"A decent movie, cool story. Not perfect, sort of over the top. Good acting though. Good for a boring night. Fresher than most movies of its type."
1,Not for me!,Disturbing. This is nothing more than demon posession made out to be aliens. This happens when towns people practice witchcraft.
2,Done better before,"If you want to watch a good film about alien abduction, Fire in the Sky does it better. If you want the cream of the crop of alien abduction, then watch the X-Files television series. The 4th Kind is alright, but it's been done much better before."
4,The Fourth Kind - Abduction,"Great movie! Completely fictional but well done. It is based on real theories about extraterrestrials/gods but the supposed ""real"" footage in the film is actually not real, at all. This isn't a slasher film or anything horror like that but it can actually put a realistic fear into your mind."
2,Bored stiff.,I'm glad I only rented this. I admit this sort of movie is not my cuppa tea. I won't be buying it. Owls are messengers according to some Amerindian beliefs. Is this why they were represented? I didn't get anything out of this. Certainly no fright. It takes something extremely scary to do that. Movies generally do not have that factor. Not for me anyway.
3,The Fourth Kind,"When I bought this Movie I was under the impression that the film was based on fact, which it is not. You can do your own digging, and find out for yourself this whole film is nothing more then Hollywood make-belive. This is basically the Blair Witch Project of science fiction. This is an entertaining film, but dose not portray Alien Abuctions in a good light. Why, out of the total population of Anchorage, they all responded in like fashon. Being abducted is not that scary, as long as you know you will be released like a fish. It's like a roller coaster ride, not everyone screams their heads off."
1,The Fourth Paranormal Activity of the Blair Witch,"Laughable.Yes, all the handi-cam footage you can bare in this one! Another movie trying to use ""actual footage"" to make someone believe in the supernatural. Not really even sure what to write here? I would have MUCH rather have had an alien abduction movie that is just exactly that. A nice, simple, plain old alien abduction movie, not some giggle inducing footage of real actors, playing real parts that are really ridiculous. The whole ""actual footage"" gimmick is kind of over for me here and if this movie wasn't billed as something it's not than I would have enjoyed it far more.So if you're still a fan of the Paranormal Activity movies then there is no doubt you will be roped into this one and could very well enjoy it. But if you aren't a fan of that genre, as I am not, then steer clear of this one as it is a waste of a precious hour and a half that you won't get back."
2,Disappointment!,"Hollywood continues to frighten the viewing public while exaggerating the negatives connected with the UFO phenomenon, even lying in this case. The film was publicized as a true story, which it is not. They professed to having real interview footage, which it does not. What it does do is scare the heck out of the audience by planting horrific visions and psycho-babble connected with UFOs and abduction. The script, effects and acting were big disappointments."
2,NOT REAL FOOTAGE.,"I just had to write a review. This was a decent movie overall. It is not filled with vulgar language, gore and sex. It is compelling, and well written. I would have given it a better rating had it not been for the HUGE DEAL they made about this being REAL footage in the movie. I can assure you, it is not. I would have been able to accept the premise, and the style because it was still well done. HOWEVER, I am still torqued about the fact that they spent SO much time trying to convince me this was actual footage of interviews. I would still recommend it. I would compare it with Communion."
4,"Alien Abduction, Real or Fantasy--You'll have to decide yourself","A tale of alien abduction and the reality of reality, The Fourth Kind is a mix of pseudo-documentary footage and fictionalized recreation. A widowed psychiatrist, Abigail Tyler, is disturbed when her sleep-disordered patients all tell the hauntingly same story. Under hypnosis, they tell tales of alien abduction, enhanced by an unusual presentation in which a split screen shows what is purported to be actual footage of the patients and a simultaneous recreation of the events they describe. Little by little, Tyler becomes increasingly frightened herself, and begins to believe their stories, and then that she and her whole family are victims of abduction.The Fourth Kind recalls movies like Communion and Fire in the Sky, but is unique in that it plays with our beliefs about truth and fiction on many levels. A complex and deeply unsettling movie."
1,"It should be called ""The BAD kind"". It's one of the worst movies of 2009.","It should be called ""The BAD kind"". It's one of the worst movies of 2009.- The whole movie never showed anything that scared or thrilled me. There were no aliens, no beasts.- There was one scene blatantly copied from ""The Exorcist"". That was where the victim floated about 2 feet above her bed. Did the director expect it to scare the wit out of us?- Ninety percent of this film is very much like ""Paranormal Activity"" in a way that it does not show any ""bad guys"". The only 3 different things are Paranormal does reveal the ""bad guy"" at the end and it's much scarier and more suspenseful.We wasted $20 on the tickets."
1,Very disappointing,"I love scary movies and watch a lot of them in all kinds of genres. I like alien abduction stuff, but probably not as much as I did as when I was a teenager. This was very slow, not scary, and the ""real"" footage was more actors. Showing the ""real"" person and the ""actor"" talking side by side about what was going on was annoying and stupid. This was one of the very few movies in the hundreds I've watched that I turned off a third of the way in and couldn't care less how it ended."
1,One of the worst movies of the year!,"This was the stupidest movie I have seen in a long time. My friend drug me to it saying it was going to be terrifying, and I wound up rolling my eyes through the whole thing. It wouldn't be that bad if they didn't claim it was real but from the opening scene it was VERY obvious it was completely fake so it was hard to like.- Not scary what-so-ever- Horrible acting- Common story plot- If you go into it thinking its real, its a major let-down.But if you like alien movies, this is for you. Its entertaining if you have nothing else to do, but RENT it DON'T BUY it. Its a waste of money."
1,This movie sucked!!!!,"Can I give less than 1 star? How about negative stars? It was just stupid, from there being a sheriff to the evergreen forests to the trendy yuppies on the street to the wonderful roads. Why say Nome? Just say Vancouver, get a location scout. And a writer, and an acting coach. Don't waste your time, read a book."
2,The Fourth Kind Just Doesn't Cut It!,"The Fourth Kind has a few scary moments, but over all, the movie has many segments that are very poor in video quality because they are apparantly from actual footage from actual events. The movie itself also seems fragmented and does not flow smoothly. I wouldn't waste my money on this one. If you are curious about the movie, just rent it."
1,Disappointed,"Think ""Blair Witch"" meets ""60 Minutes"" - with the worse of the two. poor editing, poor values; so, so disappointed."
3,Wierd Movie,"Not really what I expected, but watched it anyway,..don't think I'll watch it again though and I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Strangely watchable,"I heard about this film, and thought I would give it a chance.I must admit, it is genuinely creepy and I love the split screen effect where we see the real people - and the video taped evidence - being played right before our eyes.I cannot make up my mind that this is a ufo abduction, but if it is really just mass hysteria that is playing before us - it certainly sends a shiver down your spine.The film's direction is really very average - average performances, shots, sets etc.However, it is the real life footage that gives the film its edge. These washed out, strangely out of focus videotapes are really creepy to watch, as is the real person the film is based on - her wide eyes, frayed looking features really convice you that something very strange was going on. What? We will never really know."
1,Shades of Blair Witch Horror and Amityville Horror--fake and not as well produced,"For God's sake don't waste your time on this movie. Like the Amityvill Horror and the Blair Witch Horror this was produced to make you think it is an actual story but it is not. Worst still, it is badly produced and badly directed. The acting is non-existent. Obviously the producers,director and the woman playing the ""actual"" Dr. Tyler believe that speaking in a monotone is acting. It was all I could do to finish the movie and wish I hadn't Unlike the two mentioned, this one will not be around long enough for the admission that it is a fake. It is neither scary nor disturbing, it is too badly done to achieve either of those effects."
2,Shakycam,"Awful art direction, terrible acting, weak premise and inconsistent storytelling. Sickening overuse of blairwitch-cam. Overall a terrible restaging of the stargate plot. Leelu did okay except for some seriously awful writing and direction. YouTube they took my baby for all the impetus you need to move along."
1,Who gives a hoot?,"This film makes the ""Blair Witch"" look like an ""A"" movie. You should have had a clue when you see that the writer and the director are one in the same, Olatunde Osunsanmi, who was involved in the most horrendous abuses of the film industry. Unless he has deep pockets, someone is still funding him. Milla Jovovich can ruin her career if too many people see this film. This is a dead slow mocumetary.Abbey Tyler an Alaskan psychiatrist helps people realize that the owls in their lives are not what they seem. Then she must face her own big owl. Lots of screaming.Avoid even watching out of curiosity. It is too ridicules for words.The Shadow Men ~ Dean Stockwell"
1,Boring...Don't waste your time.,"It has been 2 days since I watched it and other then some people getting really scared under hypnosis, a white owl and Milla Jovovich, I remember nothing about this movie. Maybe the ""aliens"" or the ""Men in Black"" came and wiped my mind so I couldn't remember it. I think it is more likely the movie was so bad that my mind did me a favor and blocked it out."
1,"Beware Doubters: From, Al I. Enufo","Warning to all you reviewers & viewers (especially all you night stressed Alaskan northerners) that dare to give our story one or fewer stars. We are watching and we might be a comin' any night now. Yours, Al I. Enufo"
1,One of the worst...,"I have seen enough of ""Paranormal Activitie"" and ""Paranormal Entity."" They could have done this like a movie with the levitating and/or posession stuff being acted out. It was annoying with the split screen acting and intereviews. Hopefully they will make a remake of this one and show everything. I am so disappointed that the best parts of the movie were blocked out with fuzz and screaming. What a waist of money all the way around."
1,"I wish there was a ""NO STARS"" option!","Maybe honor is just in too short a supply these days. I believed Mila Janovich or whatever her name is at the beginning of this movie. She said it was based on something that actually happened. I would not have even watched ""The Fourth Kind"" otherwise. I believed there was actual footage in the movie, and it scared the living daylights out of me.To find I had been duped, and that the production company had to pay thousands of dollars for creating false obituaries and the like was very disappointing. In the grand scheme of things, it's not a big deal, but I don't appreciate this kind of duplicitousness, and won't watch anything that involves this cast and crew, if I can help it, ever again.The weird thing is, it wasn't necessary to lie like this. There is plenty of evidence out there of very strange goings-on that are scary as hell."
2,Quite lame,Its amazing what you can do with cheap camera tricks and a psychotic women. They seem to have a lot of time on their hands in Alaska....nuff said
5,Great Mockumenatry Movie,"It's a great movie with a great story about alien abductions in a small fictional town. Milla Jovovich is a reason alone to watch the movie. I love mockumentaries, but there's going to be thousands of tards that think this movie's real.."
1,Wow! Glad I saw this movie!,"So glad I saw this movie. It's given me the inspiration to finish my own movie on the great government cover-up over New York City, and the fact that the city is really a space vehicle made up of a cheese-like substance from the planet Zarcon One.The fact that so many people do not think that the director's use of fictional archive footage isn't a dismal addition to the sci-fi canon and demeaning to the audience's intelligence, inspires me that I, too, can make money this way. As Mencken said, ""Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public""."
1,"Sucks,boring",I should have just tossed my money out the windows. One special effect and that was talking real low and soft then crank the sound up to 10.
1,awesome as spot the goofs game terrible as a movie,where do i start about this terrible moviefirst saying that a movie is a true story and based on real eventsis really low and its really offensive to the people who actually lost a personand putting an actress as the real abigail without even putting her name in the creditsis as low as it getsthe actress who supposed to be the real abigail has actually performed wellbut the story is not convincing at all and there is a lot of goofs and mistakes in the moviethat its hard to mention all of themi used to respect universal pictures and it was my favorite studio actuallybecause they gave us focus features with its awesome movies but after thatno more universal for me and i suggest people do the sameso the studio could learn to respect the feelings of the people who actually lost a personand second the studio should respect the viewers and don't use made up stuff and say its realits just unethical to say the least
5,Fourth Kind is excellently done,"Well written material and greatly directed. Also, wonderful acting by all the actors, especially Mila J. Good setting in Alaska"
4,The Fourth Kind,"I've always been interested in this sort of stuff so this movie was right up my alley. I liked the way they incorporated ""real"" video footage with the movie, thought it made it more frightening which made it more fun to watch. I got a good thrill watching it, and if you’re a thriller/alien/UFO enthusiast you’ll like it too. No comment on the acting/directing as I’m not qualified to do that, but all were very good."
3,Movie was good but online service... Eh,"Enjoyed watching this movie. I have Amazon Prime so I also have options to free movies. There is a problem though. Your sound quality is terrible! It's really low! I also use other services like Netflix, Sony Movies, etc. & they all have perfect sound as it should be. I don't understand why Amazon's the only one who has this problem. I will be choosing to do most of myMovie buying or renting via another service forThat reason. Sorry!"
3,Is Alaska creepy?,Every time something paranormal happens the footage that is supposed to be real seems to get a bit blurry. Nice footage of Alaska. Milla Jovovich as as Dr. Abigail Tyler was great. The film is supposed to be based on a true story but there is some question as to weather or not the events are a hoax. The use Sumerian language and UFOs and most paranormal occurrences are often attended with a strong smell of sulfur. Will Patton is good in this film as well. It was at times scary and disturbing yet a bit tedious as well.See alsoParanormal Activity
3,UN-believable but Fun,"Thanks for letting me know I'm free to believe what I want Milla! I personally believe it is a Hollywood creation, which is fine by me. I see the line between ""real"" and ""fake"" is getting blurrier and blurrier for films these days, to the point they're faking footage for the purpose of storytelling. I would have enjoyed it more if it were just admittedly fiction.Still, it was creepy; you won't find me in Nome; and, I watched it during the day! (just so happens!)"
1,Terribly disappointing...,"Although I had somewhat high expectations for this movie, it didn't even qualify as mediocre. It is quite evident that the ""real footage"" isn't really real at all, the ""story"", if you want to call it that, it bunk, and the movie overall is very slow. And I won't spoil it, but the ending just kinda leaves you thinking, ""OK, now what's your point?"" I'm very critical of movies, but I can usually see past the flaws of them and at least appreciate them as entertainment, but not this. I legitimately thought that this movie was a complete was of 98 minutes of my life, and $20.00 out of my wallet. Don't waste your time or money."
3,Not Bad,This movie had one scarry part. It had my attention in the middle of the movie till the end. But it wasn't as scarry as i expected it to be. You should rent this movie but i'm not sure if it's worth spending over $10 though.
2,Another pretense of real incidents,"I love sci-fi movies, and maybe I would have liked this one better if I hadn't purchased it on the advice from a friend that this was based on true events. It is not. It's another one of those productions like... I can't remember the names of those movies. But, it's an ok movie, nothing that I would recommend though."
3,Different,"A differnet film about alien abductions. This movie was a kind of reenactment to the events surrounding the time of the abductions in northern Alaska. If you like this, you shoudl watch Fire In The Sky wuth DB Sweeney."
3,Blair Witch with aliens,"If you liked the Blair Witch Project, then this is right up your alley. It's amazing how every Alien, Witch, Ghost, Spirit or whatever it may be, has the ability to screw up any real evidence that can prove their existence. There were some interesting facts they threw in, but just enough to make you wonder. So decide for yourself, this is just my opinion."
4,Incounters,"I have been lucky enought to see a UFO in the late seventy's. To my recolecktion there was no abduction, but I do remember time loss.This movie/dockumentary brought me back to that time in my life, and make's me wonder what really happened that night."
3,Modestly entertaining pseudo-documentary,"This film didn't do all that well at the box office and was universally panned by critics. Well, it's not all that bad, but not very good either. The filmmakers do try out something different. That is, paring up real documentary footage (I think) with actors replaying the same scenes at the same time. While it's a bit disconcerting, it does give the film a sense of reality...or does it? I was fairly entertained but at the same time never really cared about the characters much. I spent a lot of time looking at Milla Jovovich and thinking how much more attractive she is than the real woman she was portraying. In the end, the film may have great appeal if you believe in UFOs and abductions. If you think that premise is all bunk, you will think this movie is too. Me? I'm not convinced either way."
2,Coulda been...but lacks polish,"A good cast starring Milla Jovovich and the venerable Will Patton.Half way through you're OK. But then it gets weaker and weaker until you find no end to ""The End"". At least not in the traditional Horror, Sci-fi genre. It's as if the director ran out of money and used a lenghty on-screen script to finalize his endeavor. The audience is left hanging with quite a bit of unresolved situations previously introduced. No resolve!The cinematography is awfully pale considering the location.The sets are droll.If you're going to do a ""true story"" piece you had better be right on or at least introduce a bit more melodrama to even the score."
1,One Of The Worst Ever,"I bought this off iTunes and almost failed to back it up on purpose, now they allow redownloading purchases to yeah. I AVOID watching this it's so bad. Prior to viewing i thought it's got Milla it can't be bad, it's so bad... simply the worst alien encounter type movie imaginable. The most disturbing thing about it is the creepy bug-eyed lady playing the actual person the story is based on, or the actress... whatever, it's just horridly bad.I only own the dvd, but i doubt HD would make this any better."
2,For those who thought Chariots of the Gods was a work of nonfiction,"Designed for the gullible and the easily impressed, ""The Fourth Kind"" (as in ""Close Encounters of ..."") is an alien-abduction tale that is long on gimmickry and contrivance and short on credibility and suspense.Milla Jovovich plays a hypnotherapist in Nome, Alaska, who, in 2000, allegedly discovered that some mighty strange things had begun happening to the residents of the town, incidents very possibly extraterrestrial in nature. The movie mixes re-enactments of the events at the time with audio and video recordings purportedly showing us actual, first-hand accounts of those events - although anytime anything of any real interest or significance starts to occur, the sound and images conveniently go to static.Directed by Olatunde Osunsanmi, this warmed-over serving of ""Chariots of the Gods"" foolishness - combining ancient Sumerian dialects with invasive body-cavity probing - is strictly for the tin-foil hat crowd."
2,A mockumentary,"There have been several movies in recent years that have done a decent job presenting fictional stories as documentaries but this isn't one of them. For starters, Mila Jovovich opens the movie with a monologue as herself (""I'm Mila Jovovich..."")stating that the footage we're about to see is real - that's an unethical stunt. It's one thing to present documentary style footage and lead the audience to buy into what they're seeing (Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, etc), it's another thing entirely to make a statement that it's real when it's not. I question Mila Jovovich's integrity for even attempting such a deliberate deception. Even knowing it's fake before watching didn't alleviate my ire watching them present this fictional work as real."
5,upbeat and mellow,all the music i purchased and will continue to purchase is very satisfying to the ears. this cd makes the enviroment peaceful and very pleasant to listen too!!!!
3,Important note for your decision *,"Shon Harris materials are an excellent training resource. Highly recommended, but for this video package, I learned a very expensive lesson after purchasing. Unlike a school book that you may resell as used after class, Shon Harris (Logical Security) End User License Agreement (EULA), does not permit you to resell as used or even un-used, nor give it away, nor rent, or lease it; they only allow you to distroy it.

Now that I'm done with the CISSP, I tried offering through eBay my used original DVD package, Logical Security contacted eBay and removed the ad. That's when I became aware of this situation.

2,MISERABLE...,"Books, especially books for young people, don't have to be full of misery to get a point across. Didn't see much to laugh about here."
3,comfy,comfy but it only last for a few months after that it looks very old.. even though I only wear it to my office but not everyday..
1,My wife was thoroughly disappointed,I got this gift wrapped for my wife's xmas present. When she opened it she thought it was an interesting play on one of her favorite items. She tried it out and ended up in the ER. Not cool. This is not what you think it is.
2,undiscovered was by far the worst movie of the year,OK lets just sum it up for everyone boy meets girl in corny subway scene then they meet up a couple years later they sleep together then they break up he makes it big time as a singer and he becomes mean (it was shocking NOT) then he becomes nice they meet at the airport and get back together and he decides to become a writer WOW that was sooo lame and boring i left to go to the bathroom and i actually looked for a way to escape lol. o and of course ashlee simpson sings b/c then the movie wouldn't of even made it to theaters. and the main characters name is breyer why didn't they just name her turkey hill or edys. and wat ever moron played Breyer did a terrible job i mean horrid.i clapped when it was over i think i was the loudest in the whole theater.
1,"OY, the pain!","This movie was truly awful and a waste of time. It has a very typical and predictable plot. It's a ""boy meets girl, boy meets girl again, boy loses girl, boy finds girl again."" A moron could write this storyline. Let me just say one thing: Stephen Moyer and Carrie Fisher must have owed an agent money to be put in this awful piece. It's a waste of their talent and an embarrassment to their careers. I was cringing for the both of them.Do not waste your money. Get something with substance instead of this, something with a better storyline that is not strewn with stupid dialog and predictable predicament."
4,very good,"I am a big fan of Ashlee Simpsons! I read alot of the reveiws online and was alittle worried to get this movie, but I did, and I have to say, I'm glad I did! Ashlee isn't in it alot but she is alittle but! She sings two songs and one with the character Steven Strait! I thought it was an awesome movie! If you like Ashlee Simpson, and Romantic movies, with hot musicians (haha) then get this!Lots of these people probably haven't even seen this movie, they're just writing bad stuff about it cause of Ashlee! So ignore them! :)"
2,not very impressed,"I wasn't expected much when I went to see this movie, and so I wasn't too disappointed. The acting is all right, but there really isn't any story and it's generally neither enjoyable nor believable. The entire movie seems to be about how good looking Steven Strait is and what a great musician he is, and while he is relatively good looking and can sing, there isn't enough there to make an entire movie out of."
1,BOOORRRRRIIIIIINNNNNGGGG!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is way too predictable..... boy meets girl, boy and girl go on separate roads, boy girl find once more...and so on... one can pretty much guess the ending. Like said before teh story line is way to predictable and thus BORING. Acting was mearly OK, even ashley's acting was lacking. Over all I would say dont wast your time and money on this one. But then again this is only my opinion."
1,Ashlee Simpson.... enough said.,Just the fact that Ashless Simpson is in it should be warning enough. Her performance seemed froced and she was better on SNL the (first time). This movie was Terrrible!!!!!
3,GREAT SHOW !!!,"And the best Gary Numan live performance ever in my opinon.Despite the dismally apalling sound (you'll really need a lot of signal reconstruction processing like a BBE or a harmonic enhancer to just make it sound acceptable) the perfomance is incredibly vital and rockier than ever due to the incredible guitarrist Kipper (some kind of Steve Stevens clone) and freshman Richard Beasley on drums,who adds an incredible percussion job to his not-as tight-as-Cedric -Sharpley drumming.No live bass this time except those few older material that keyboardist Ade Orange performs at his own risk (first time on bass.... !! )giving most of the tracks the one note boom synthesized bass typical of that time in Numan's career.The tracklist spans his entire career,from early singles to 2 songs of the then recent Machine And Soul album.There is a VHS tape with this same show that's said to feature better sound.For the Numan initiated ONLY."
4,Mysterious Twist,"HNIC is a novel written in today's time, however the many facets of slavery rings out as Chuck, the main character, wears the title obliviously. He is a great `love-to-hate' character. HNIC is a true `who-dun-it' page-turner. It enlightens and entertains the reader on everyday doings in the world of big business and big money. With a mysterious twist this novel dictates the cons of politics and the diring need of a ""racially"" operated city to groom a HNIC in order to keep ""faux"" peace within the communities; black communities that is. HNIC differs greatly in plot as the author's first novel, 'Zon', but the need to reveal the world and its prejudices plays major roles in both. This is a quick and easy read."
1,the character section is fictitious!,"I actually give this zero stars!!!Part of this book was written by Martin Bowman, the section about character animation. I happen to know that Mr. Bowman does not know a thing about the subject and he knows that too!I find it disgusting that a student may have bought this and wasted what little money they have. They are being decieved by this section of the book!! This is meant to be a teaching aid but his section just misinforms. There are plenty of books out there that are a thousand times better and are written buy people that have the knowledge and a wealth of experience of the subject matter they are writing about."
1,GREATEST STORY WORST EBOOK,WONDERFUL BOOK. TERRIBLE DOWNLOAD ON KINDLE. LOOKS LIKE NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS CUT UP AND PATCHED TOGETHER. SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH NOOK VERSION. WHY DOESN'T DOUBLEDAY MAKE A CORRECTED AND CLEAR VERSION FOR THE EREADERS
1,Very bad copy!,"This ""e-book"" is one of the worst scanned documents I have ever seen! It is a badly scanned copy with lines cut out and letters along the rim cut off. The book is wonderfully written. I'd suggest you buy a hard copy and scan it yourself. 5 Star book 0 star copy! If they gave it away for free it would still be an injustice! Whoever did this doesn't deserve your money!"
3,SANTA,MOVIE WAS DIFFRENT BUT IT HAD BILL GOLDBERG AND HE KILLES A LOT OF PEOPLE BILL IS THE EVIL SANTA CLAUSE EX WCW AND WWE WORLD CHAMPION
2,Racist Against Santa Claus,"After 1,000 years of spreading Christmas cheer, Santa Claus turns evil and kills people at Christmastime. Lame! The only redeeming value of this film is its humor. The reason most people like it is that Santa kills people. Ooooh. Entertaining. I think the Chronicles of Narnia did a better job. They had Santa Claus in that film, but they didn't even need him to kill people. And since when is murder and killing regarded as funny?"
4,Santa's Slay Is Good,"A very funny and enjoyable Christmas flick. Goldberg does an excellent job at being a hilarious killer santa, worth the buy for the Christmas season alone. The deaths are very cool and the film itself isn't too bad either.If you like this one i would recommend you get ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" it is the best killer santa flick ever made.Buy This!"
3,Satan's Slay !,"David Steiman's ""Santa's Slay"" staring former pro wrestler Bill Goldberg as the evil santa claus is a very fun & absolutely stupid 100% tongue in cheek sit back with your spiked eggnog & roll your eyes while chuckling new holiday classic. This dvd package comes with plenty of extras & is a must for the film fan in search of worthy christmas horror flicks,wich there are not many of!"
4,Ho ho ho,"Bill Goldberg is Santa. Goldberg is Jewish and now he is Santa, what an oxy-moron. I should also note that Goldberg hated comedy. He didnt like it in wrestling and hated how WWE portrayed him because they used comedy. A year after leaving WWE, he makes this yuletide log. It says that Brett Ratner directed this film but I cant tell if its the Ratner who made big Hollywood movies or a guy with the same name. I checked The Internet Movie Database but it gave little info about the movie. It starts off by killing some C list celebritys and then ensues a funny moment with a old woman in a deli. The movie has some great moments and is a very short movie. I enjoyed it and will probably watch it every Christmas till I die. Highly entertaining for fans you love crappy horror movies."
1,"Help spread the ""yuletide fear!""","Everyone in this film knew what they were doing and they pulled it off wonderfully. ""Santa's Slay"" is a hilarious film starring Bill Goldberg as an evil Santa Claus. It's violent, cheesy, and just plain fun. Who doesn't want to see Goldberg as Santa kill Chris Kattan? Or how about all the great one-liners? For me, what separates this movie from just regular B movie horror trash is its self-consciousness and the effort the writers put into the story. It's not just your run of the mill slasher flick, they actually rewrote the history of Santa Claus and created their own myth. And it works, for the most part. The first half is much more entertaining then the second half.All in all, this movie goes down with other great/horrible Santa Claus movies like ""Santa with Muscles"" and ""Santa Claus conquers the Martians."""
1,santa's slay,I thought this movie really sucked. I went by the reviews I read against my better judgement. This was a total waste of money. The price is outageous for this piece of crap. What is happening to this genre?
4,Great Dark Christmas Story,Pleasently surprise by this movie. Now this is a bad bad Santa.Dont ask him anything for Christmas.... you wont like what hebrings you.The movie goes staight to the point of entertainment. Prettygood scenes ...and check out Santa's sleigh....excellent.I did notice some quality actors in there too.Worth a couple of viewings....
5,A crystalline fragment of aesthetic sensibility.,"This is the document of a poet consecrating himself to memory. His attempt to maintain perspective; his aesthetic self objectification that is repeatedly shattered when he looks into society; his Catholocism, his ennui, his mistress, his mother...all these cast a definitely ""intimate"" hue to the pages that are essential for any reader wishing to come to terms with Baudelaire's psyche: to see why his self-destruction was inseparable from his creations. For they were both necessary symptoms of his sensibility - an immaculately modern sensibility. The fragmented nature of the writings prevents the work from actually being a ""work"" - it is more like an authentic gesture, an unpremeditated act of self revelation. A fascinating and ultimately harrowing document from a poet - nothing more."
4,Good-Not Perfect,Set-up was a breeze. My only problem with it is you need alot of light-natural light works best- to get a good picture.
5,Collinite 870 Wax,This is a realy great wax as it keeps my cruiser shining all summer long! It is the only wax that I use and I have been cleaning and waxing my boats for over 45 years. I use a swirl remover polish to a clean and mirror like surface to start and then apply two coats of Collinite 870. It makes my cruiser shime like a mirror!
2,NOT COMFORTABLE,My friend bought a pair of these skates for me her and her little sister. They are not comfortable at all!! My friend and her sister have to wear 2 pairs of socks with there skatings because the bottom of the skates hurts your foot and I can't wear mine at all. They fit good as far as length but they are very narrow and I have had these skates now for 2 years and nothing has changed i go skating twice a week and I have to get the skating rink used skates because mine hurt my feet. This was not a good buy.
5,Long Time Coming but Worth the Wait,"I would like to review this product but more than a month after it was ordered it still has not been delivered. I originally wanted to give this as a Christmas gift but until about a week after the confirmation I had no idea that the item was going to take so long to be delivered. Amazon should be a bit more upfront about their product offerings. I am sure that Mike Seeger does not have to create each video and in the product description, when it is not in current stock, it should be noted. Unfortunately, for all of the videos in this collection, the delay is a couple of months.The DVD finally arrived (in August) and like other Seeger products it is first rate. In each of the songs Mike goes through the specific style at full clip and slowly. You need to play this through several times because a lot of his style is subtle - but the DVD is well worth the price for anyone interested in old time banjo styles."
4,Don't read into it too much... just prepare to laugh,"It's not anti-gay... it's not cleverly disguised subversive wit... it just is what it is - spontaneous acoustic made up on the spot tunes with extremely hilarious tongue-in-cheek improvised lyrics delivered first-take that loosely revolve around a homosexual theme. If that bothers you then don't listen. If you're looking for something deeply intellectual then look elsewhere. If you want to laugh yourself senseless then buy this album. It sags a bit in places, but tunes like ""I've Got Drugs (Out of the Mist)"", ""Hot C@*ck Annie"", ""Queen Boys"", and ""Baby Greaser George"" never lose their novelty."
4,Utterly Hilarious (for the most part),"Let me put it this way: If you are at all amused by Wesley Willis, Ween, The Moldy Peaches, or any other disturbed ""outsider"" act, you'll love this album. It's about a half hour's worth of surprisingly catchy ""anti-folk"" with (apparently ad-libbed) lyrics about sodomy and child molestation that sounds like it was recorded on a boom box. What more could you ask for? Find it used if you can."
1,words too distracting,"The music is somewhat clever, perhaps a little better than the average amateur rock band (they know more than 3 chords), but nothing like TMBG or the Beatles. There is some clever mixing and a few extra instruments brought in for effect on a few tracks. But what mostly makes this CD unique is the words, which seem designed to instill homophobia. Every track (except the first, which is about being stoned) is a song about ""what that gay guy did to me on the beach"" and ""this is a faggy town we live in"". This theme is overused and distracting."
4,A superb story of survival,"Meg Files writes great fiction: important, moving, and entertaining. This book is full of high-stakes danger, choices, and consequence. It's bravely written, scary, page-turning novel with a strong and admirable young woman (and dog) braving the worst odds, and surviving."
4,Nice book,"This book is mostly exciting. The writing is superb and the plot is unique. I thought it was going to be another ""On The Beach,"" but I was wrong. I had a little problem with all the past to present segues and since I was most interested in the present story got a bit bored. But it is a worthwhile read."
5,SIMPLE CHOICE,IF YOU ARE A HARD-CORE TULL FAN THEN YOU WILL LOVE THIS DVD. IF YOU ARENT THEN YOU WON'T. THIS IS MY 5TH TULL DVD AND THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY BEST.
3,She compared HIM to Mozart...,"Even though I enjoyed some of the anecdotes and testimonies of the various members and ex-members of Jethro Tull regarding their experiences on the road, it seems to me that MUSIC is the great absent from this documentary. There is no real discussion of Jethro Tull's music -of the way it progressed, or rather changed, from one album to another- and of the influence of the rest of the band in Ian Anderson's songs. There is some old gossip (Cornick departure, the APP era retirement, the ""revamped"" Jethro Tull of 1980)and little surprises.Oh, and there is a moment when Dee Palmer brings out, without any valid justification, some soporific comments about the presence of ""scatological humour"" in some of the Great Geniuses of Mankind: from Mozart to... Ian Anderson!!! Did she had in mind the ""warm fart at XMAS"" from ""Bad Eyed and Loveless""? C'mon, give us a break!!!"
3,It's true about judging a book by its cover.,"I read this years ago, and I've kept it because I do remember how well crafted and compelling the short stories were. It's important to note that the cover, with an illustration which I find to be incredibly unappealing, belies the quality of the writing inside."
4,I think that it was a really exciting book!,"I think it was a really good book. The feelings and emotions i it make it so strong. I think any book with Ned Nickerson in it is a really good book. I love being able to read a book and actually feel what and how the characters are feeling, and I could feel how worried everyone was over Nancy's safety."
5,AWESOME!!!,BEST BOOK EVER!!! NANCY DREW IS STILL COOL! IF YOU LIKE NANCY DREW THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU!!!!
3,Not the best....,"I read this book and it was preatty good, but, I like some of the other Nancy Drew books better than this one. There aren't many parts that have to do with skiing so the title should have been something like ""Mystery of the Forest Fur Company"". Another thing is that you knew who the bad people were, start to finish. A good book, but I reccomend some of the other Nancy Drew books more than this. (I reccomend all of them :-D)"
5,It's A Great Book!,This book is so great! This book is about Nancy Drew solving a mink mistery. It involves a lady named Mrs. Channing who is selling fake stock and mink stoles.
2,It Never Held My Interest,"This review concerns the original 1952 edition as well as the revised 1968 edition which is a shorter version of the original. Nacy investigates a woman named Mitzi Channing who is selling stolen furs and worthless stock to people. I don't know why the author titled this book ""Mystery At The Ski Jump"" because skiing and ski jumps have next to nothing to do with the mystery. The mystery is alright, but there isn't much action or suspence. The ending of the book is not bad, but it's another one of those boring ""Nancy has nothing to do with actually capturing the criminals and only hears about it after the fact"" endings. This is not a book that I'd strongly recommend."
2,Tool vs toy,Dont send a boy to do a mans job..Dissapointed in Milwakee's product for the first time. problems with chuck bearings. can not screw or drill much load. maybe a 12V drill should be called a screw gun not a drill
5,La mirada a un mundo fascinante,"Ya sea que lo lea como una historia de ciencia ficción (novela) o como una entrada al mundo de lo esotérico encontramos los relatos muy amenos. Se encuentra cronológicamente estructurado y bien redactados. Es observar las prácticas de lo que se encontraba hasta hoy oculto, en la mirada inquisitiva de una mujer profesional. El lector debe comprender que no se comparte profundidas de conocimiento sino; como bien se títula el libro sus experiencias."
4,Good intro to Santeria,"This is a pretty good introduction to the basics of Santeria. There is some information in the book which is questionable, so I would say read this with a grain of salt and decide for yourself. The author does describe Palo Mayombe as dark and evil, and this is not so, Palo is a beautiful practice and should not be degraded like this. That aside, this was one of my first books on Santeria and it does give good descriptions of readings, recieving beads and warriors, asiento, and more. There are also several photographs of altars, botanicas, and fetishes. For the most part, a good solid book. For difinitive answers, seek out a santera or santero."
1,I am an Olorisa (priest/Santero) with over 29 years of training,"I am an Olorisa (priest/Santero) with over 29 years of training and experience.Based on my credentials, I must say that over a span of more than 30 years Migene Gonzalez-Wippler has put out more misinformation on Orisa worship/Santeria than any single author I can think of. There is no enlightenment on the religion I serve in these pages. To really learn about Orisa worship/Santeria ask an Olorisa (priest/Santero).Sincerely,Temujin Ekunfeo Ala Aganju"
1,Santeria - by Migene Gonzalez-Wippler,"I am not satified with this product. I ordered this book and instead they sent me two copies of ""Santeria The Religion"" (World Religon and Magic Series). I would like the book that I ordered and paid for ""Santeria"" By Migene Gonzalez-Wippler"" immediately.Thank you,Mona Ghaffari"
1,I Don't Appreciate The Author Including Pictures of Items I Wasn't Supposed to See,"The author includes pictures of otones and I was told that only the initiated are supposed to see them. If the author was truly versed in Santeria, she would have known better than to include those pictures in the book."
3,"comprehensive, useful dictionary","well organized, comprehensive, useful dictionary. The English translations could have been better proofread (some mistakes), but i don't know about the Portuguese side. Overall, only minor errors that cause minor complications. Serves its purpose for someone needing portuguese-english translations."
4,Very good,This book exaggerates the competence of the Germans and the incompetence of their enemies but is otherwise the best book on Norway in 1940. Adam Claasen's book on Luft operations is also worth looking at. Now all we need is an English-language book on the Netherlands as good as this one on Norway.
2,"A political history, not a military history","I purchased this book hoping to read about the naval engagements during the Norway campaign, and learn more about the ground battles. Sadly, these were dealt with in passing. The sinking of the German destroyer fleet in Narvik, for example, is barely given a paragraph! Also, this book is overloaded with explanation marks and rather dry and poor humor.On the other hand, it is a good history of the political machinations - which were no less dramatic than the military ones. On all sides other than the German (Norwegian, British, and French) there were ever-changing arguments, strategies, and conflicts ultimately leading to both defeat and replacing Neville Chamberlain.It is a worthwhile book, but would be better off subtitled ""The Political Conflict Between the Allies."""
5,Must have for all production libraries,"This book covers it all in the technical world of content delivery. I wish I had this book much earlier. Even though it is not current in the area of HD, it covers enough ground to make the numerous delivery fomats clear. This book should be required reading for all students of broadcasting."
5,A must have.....,"As somebody who started compressing video - and 2D & 3D animations, a couple of years before Ben, I still found this to be a great book, a good read and well laid out. I'm sure I'll be refering to this book every now and then for a good time to come."
5,lovely lovely,"There is no reason not to love King Kong. King Kong makes me jump around like a mad fool. Ethan sings simply about animals and weird objects, but it's just unexplainable how King Kong is not just music, but injectable happiness. Put this beginning CD in your car, blast it or dance around your house in your .... Ethan would want it that way for you."
2,Great bra if the underwire didn't break through so quickly,"This bra is great for large-busted women - the wider, padded shoulder straps, four-hook band and full coverage. I also really liked the seamless look, great to wear under t-shirts. It doesn't come up too high under the armpits and does not have a band under the cups, so there is nothing to roll up. However, I've had two of these, and the underwire breaks through in the same place - at the breastbone. For as much as it cost, it'd be nice if they reinforced the wire better."
2,Goddess Smooth Simplicity bra,"Though this is an accurate fit, it tends to allow slippage under the cups after wearing awhile."
2,Not so happy but that is kinda expected,"As a girl that can't just go out and buy my bras in the store because most don't carry it I was supremely unhappy with this bra. The style is okay, but it rides up in the back, and the wire shifts drastically because it is missing like two inches of wire. Not okay manufactuers, not okay. It arrived ahead of schedule which was great, but now I have to send them back because of the defect with the wire the other stuff I could have dealt with but the wire shift makes it hella uncomforatble to wear all day long. As a big girl I expect these kind of malfunctions when looking for a bra it is just the way it is. Sad but true."
1,Should be called a minimizer bra,"This bra should be called a minimizer bra. I ordered a 40C and when I put this bra on, I swear I could see my feet! It was extremely uncomfortable. If I was looking for a bra to smash me down to a smaller size, this would have been ideal. But, I was looking for support and lift. I gave it away to someone who wears a small C and I hope it works better for her. I am a full C and don't want to be a B!"
4,Nice Lift,Good fit...Comfortable...I've only worn it once.I don't know how it holds up to wash and wear.
2,wire too long?,"This bra is constructed exactly the way I like, with double-ply molded, SEAMLESS cups. But the underwire is slightly too long for my C cup size, and it digs uncomfortably into my underarm, making this maybe the most uncomfortable bra I've ever tried to wear. I was very disappointed."
3,"They need to add ""underwire"" to the description.","I was hoping to buy a wireless bra and I prefer Goddess brand and I thought this was looked great BUT it does have an underwire but there is no mention of that in the description.Everything else was fine, and if the description was accurate, it would have earned 5 stars, but I then I probably would have bought a different Goddess bra."
5,Dated but Still Applicable,"I still have my original copy that I purchased in 1977. It is one of the more entertaining ""training"" flight training manuals. All the information is pertinent to off airport/ paved strip operations. I love the way Link Grindle illustrates and he doles out some great jewells of wisdom especially for those new to flying."
1,Not an extension cord,Whatever you're plugging in must be able to reach the outlet. The 15' cord is for the on/off switch only.
1,NOT an Extension Cord,"I bought this item thinking it was what the product name describes, namely an extension cord with a switch. It does not extend the power at all. Instead the item you want to plug in plugs in to one end of this cord. The cord then has 15 feet of wire with a switch at the end. I did not use the product, so I don't know if it has the problems that other customers have mentioned. But I can say if you want an item that has a switch AND acts as a power extension cord, do not buy this product. Amazon, please change the name to something like ""15-ft Wired Electrical Power Switch."""
4,Faulty description,"This is a single one piece plug and socket with a switch on a 15' cord.The Good:Well made.Works as stated.The Bad:The plug and socket are part of a piece that's ~2"" tall so you will need 2 1/2"" or more clearance to plug it in.Single socket not 3 outlets.The Ugly:The cord for the remote switch could be longer.Socket is one piece with the plug not on the end of a 15' cord.Overall a good value, just not as easy to use as I hoped."
3,Sticking switch,"The ""Woods 16/2 Extension Cord with Switch, Wired Remote On/Off"" does exactly what I need it to do but there is a slight problem, the large push button occasionally sticks within the switch body."
5,magnificent,majidi is brilliant. he has a finger on the pulse of humanity and and suffering with an eye toward redemption and truth. all of his work is special and beautiful and if you want to cry and be touched then explore his work. you will not be disappointed.
2,NOT MADE WELL,"I purchased this sack to compress my clothes on a trip and it tore on the top seam, the first time I used it. I sent it back to amazon, they sent me another one, and the second one tore in the same place. I liked size and idea of it, but the seam on the top lip is a poor design."
2,"Great fit, horrible buckles","I bought this stuff sack to match my wonderful Slumberjack sleeping bag. As soon as I put my bag in the sack and began to tighten the straps, one of the buckles snapped off. About a week later, another one broke, forcing me to tie two of the straps as tight as possible. I don't know if this is an isolated incident, but I don't recommend tightening the straps all the way unless you want to lose a buckle or two."
1,don't mean to be critical but . . .,"the guitar work here is not that stellar. In fact, these songs are very simple licks repeated over and over. There is some tweaking on some of the tracks with basic shaping tools but that effort is quite pedestrian as well. These guys have a long, long way to go before they begin to approach the musical talent of, say, a Buckethead. MY monkeysoop CD is for sale; make an offer."
5,This book shows what it's like to be in high school.,"This book was dealing with the pressure some students face in high school, wanting to get into a good college to please their parents, and trying to look good in front of their peers at the same time. The character has some tough times, including having to deal with some racist kids, but she's a very dynamic character and by the end finds peace with herself, her parents, and her friends."
4,NICE!,It was a very well written book. I just wish I had a picture of Marie G. Lee for my Oral report on her.
4,: ),"I'm an international student from Korea. The book itself was interesting and it made me think a lot about Korean people in America because Ellen, who is a main character of this book is from Korean immigrant familly. Through this book, I could see how she has matured in her thinking and I thought about how the Korean people went through their troubles. At the same time, I found the answer to how I can cope with my living situation in America. It was a precious experience for me to read this book."
3,Finding My Voice...,"The story is about a Korean girl whose name is Ellen and lives in America with her family. Ellen is a senior high school student. She is under a pressure from her parents who really care about her future and want her to get all A's to be qualified for Harvard, just like her sister Michelle. Ellen was also under a pressure from some popular senior students who tease her about her Korean or Asian appearance. All in all, the book mentions almost everything that comes to Ellen's mind during the conversations and events, and thats what makes the book more realistic. It is interesting specificly for high school students. Besides, it is easy and quite short."
4,A Young Priest in Turmoil,"Office of Innocence tells a somewhat familiar story (that of a young priest experiencing an inner crisis) in a different way. The fact that the story is set takes place in World War II helps because it gives it added drama. Frank Darragh is tempted by a POW widow, and he's faced with difficult choices because of his feelings for her. This novel is also a mystery story. All the plot elements all come together very well. Office of Innocence is not Mr. Keneally's best book, but it's readable and enjoyable."
1,Broken,This item came in with the right hinge broken.I was so mad I threw it in the garbage can!!! Toilet seat!!
1,What a waste of time and money,"Pretty obvious that the company that ships this doesn't care if it makes it in one piece or not... mine didn't. Gees, the hing was broken, a hard part to break the way it was packaged, so I think it must have been broken before they even shipped it. It was banged up, nicked, scratched and a total mess. Amazon was great and paid for shipping back to them (I haven't gotten a refund yet but don't expect any problems with Amazon. They's always been great). But for the small price difference, you're better off going to Home Depot or Lowes and seeing what you're getting."
1,Hinge is a piece of crap,Hinges are made of crummy quality metal material. They're engineered very thin around the screw holes. Then after six months of use the metal corroded and broke. Very low quality design and construction.
4,a modern romance,"For a modern romance, it was pretty good. Being in my forties also, I like the idea of a middle life romance instead of the main female character being in early twenties. It has a mature theme and identifies with today's society ( I'm not saying today's society is living right), but the book does reflect issues of today. It is the first Stockenberg novel I've read and I look forward to reading more. I have ""Dream a Little Dream"" and have heard good things about it. Hopefully, it will further intice me to read more of her novels."
1,CHARMED PLACE,DIDNT CARE FOR THIS BOOK. TOO SAPPY AND DID NOT HOLD MY INTEREST. IST BOOK BY THIS AUTHOR. DISAPPOINTING FOR SURE
3,authorpholloway,"This book is very slow moving. If a book is long because it has a lot of story to tell, that's good. But this book seemed to be long for the purpose of using as many words as possible. I like a book that moves along at a better clip.The story itself, I loved. It's a love story about two people finding each other after years apart. They are now both middle aged and have, what appears to be, too many road blocks on her part. Maddy's own mother thinks the love of her life, Dan, killed her father. Maddy's ex-husband has gone crazy and is determined to break them up and Maddy's teen-aged daughter is on her daddy's side.The reader finally gets to find out who did what to whom but that's not the end. It should end there but then there's a long epilog. Once a story is done, finish it.This book is probably ideal for someone who likes to make a book last over months and the writing is very good. But I prefer a faster pace."
3,Okay workout--best before 20 weeks,"I rented this DVD from my local library and found that much of the Pilates work is done on your back--without modifications made for those of us past the 20-week mark. This DVD is made in Australia and does not follow the guidelines of the American College of Obstetricains and Gynecologists which says to avoid any exercises on your back after 20 weeks. I tried to make modifications, but since I'm not a Pilates expert, that was difficult. I really enjoyed the stretching parts and the Pilates that I could do, but I would have enjoyed the workout more if I could have done more of the exercies (currently 34 weeks pregnant). The instructor does comment that pregnant women should not be on their back long and so he spreads out the on-the-back exercises so that you would be on your back for several shorter sessions rather than one big long session. Just understand this workout's limitations before you decide to buy."
5,New to Serious Band Literature?,"If so, this disc is a great place to begin. The performances indeed are technically assured; any perceived balance problems may be due to closer-than-usual microphone placement. The interpretations are expansive yet spirited, with plenty of enthusiastic percussion to drive home the point. The Chaconne of the Holst First Suite, in particular, benefits from an unhurried reading, while the reading of the Schmitt is noteworthy for its high energy. No other disc offers both of the Holst Suites and Grainger's Lincolnshire Posy, and this one throws in the Schmitt as well. Unless you're looking for a Holst/Vaughan Williams pairing (such as offered by Reynish and the RNCM Wind Orchestra on Chandos), you'd be hard-pressed to find a core-repertoire band disc much better than this one.Performances: 4.5 out of 5 -- Choice of Works: 5 out of 5"
2,"Great Repitoire, Mediocre Performance","I am a big fan of the Holst and Grainger on this album, and I appreciated the introduction to the Schmitt. However, I was sorely disappointed at the amateurish sound of the ensemble. While I did not note any mistakes per se, the balance of the group, as well as the sound of the individual instruments, was not up to the standard I would have expected from a national military band. (I guess I've been spoiled by the high quality of the US armed forces ensembles.) If you want a recording of both the Holst and the Grainger, spend the extra money and get discs where they're recorded separately, and better."
5,good condition and excelent CD,The CD came on time and in excelent condition. I am very pleased with my purchase.thanks.
2,Griz,"Spanish dialog. A modernized version of the classic Mexican ""LLORONA"" folk tale. Story line seems to be a compilation of two Mexican and American folk tales. The American, Lady in white tale and the Mexican, Wailing woman tale. Special effects and acting by the characters in the movie left much to to desired. This movie will disappoint. Do not buy it, if you must see it find it as a rental."
1,Way overpriced,Purchased toy as a gift. The price for this toy was six times more than what it was going for in the stores. Even though it may have been discontinued in some stores making a little profit is ok. However this mark up was outrageous. I will think very hard about buying from this merchant again. In addition i found the delivery to be slow.
2,Very poor finish,Sewing around the edges is large and cheaply done. Fabric is nice. Too bad they make it look like a DYI effort.
5,Great yoga music,"I love this album; great for my yoga classes. My clients enjoy it as well. Very soothing, great for meditation as well."
2,Worked well until data corruption became the norm.,"I've been using the SimpleTech Bonzai STI-USB2FD/2GB for over a month now. My primary use is to have a portable version of Eudora Pro and to maintain my PGP keyrings. The speed and size of the flash drive made this a perfect application.A few days ago, I transferred a few large ZIP files onto the flash, pretty much filling the 2GB of drive space. Ever since, the drive has become unreliable, resulting in uncorrectable 'chkdsk' errors and causing file corruption errors. The drive has been formatted multiple times to no avail.The SimpleTech 2GB flash drive was one of the first, and by far the cheapest one to market. Either my device or the design may have been slightly before its time. I'm currently waiting for other vendors to come out with 2GB flash drives under $200. I will not be considering SimpleTech in the future."
2,Good for Beginners,"The book gave suggestions of how to become a more assertive person without a drastic personality change. A good book for learning beginning methods of setting objectives, communicating more honestly, and working through uncomfortable and akward situations. I would recommend for business students who are without practical experience."
3,hmm...,"well... i had one of these before and loved it but i think the coils on this one is slightly smaller because they tend to slip through the grill rods... the last one didn't... a little disappointed. it still works, but i need to be more careful."
5,Excellent Introductory Book,"If you're a novice at wireless networks like me, you'll love this book. This book will give you all the important information and tasks you need to successfully set up a wireless netork. You'll learn what you need to know from an maximum of visuals and a minimum of dense, techno-speak."
2,Disappointed,"This is a very basic book - if you want to configure as they outline it probably will work, but if you have anything not on their path, it won't. In addition, there was no overview at the beginning of each chapter explaining what was the objective of the chapter, which made it quite hard to figure out whether you should follow the steps outline. This really limited its value.I wanted to connect three computers wirelessly together, share information and print on a printer attached to one computer. Based upon the title and description of the book it should have contained that information, but didn't."
3,Incomplete and TOO visual!,"Maybe a ""Visual"" format is really too much here. Do we really need to see a picture of a computer with folders flying out of it? The screen shots were great, but there were far too many pointless pictures. This book also did not even mention channels! C'mon...thats a pretty important concept I wanted to know more about. the book also failed to mention wireless bridging hardware or even considerations when setting up a network with several possibly overlapping access points. Too basic of a book, probably only suited for the home networker."
5,WOW!,"This is constantly in my cd player! It's the perfect CD if you're a fan of Eric Whitacre. Every song I ever wanted is on there, and I thank the BYU singers profusely for recording this CD. The chord structures get me every single time. It's enough to send chills down your spine."
3,whitacre,"I bought this CD because it included the piece ""Lux aurumque"", which I feel must have been inspired because it transforms the listener into another realm. The other pieces are well done, too, but none reach me in the same way as ""Lux aurumque"". I love the tight overlapping harmonies and suspensions."
5,Great Lo-Fi with historic value,"Along with Pavement's ""Slanted & Enchanted"", ""III"" helped Lo-Fi garner respect as a credible subgenre. It's pretty uneven, but overall it's very good. Most of the tracks are more interesting than fun, though (but with 23 tracks that's not a problem). Because of the number of its highlights, as well as its historical importance, I give this 5 stars (but with caution, except for ""The Freed Pig"" its a very acquired taste and only for fans of the genre). Highly recommended for Lo-Fi fans as well as music collectors and historians.Highlights include:""The Freed Pig""""Total Peace""""Truly Great Thing""""Kath""""Perverted World""""Wonderful, Wonderful""""Limb By Limb""""Rockstar""""Renaissance Man""""God Told Me""""Violet Execution"" (parts of)""Scars, Four Eyes"" (parts of)""Holy Picture."" (parts of)"
4,"Better than Judas Priest's ""Hell bent for leather""","this cd is cool. And when I say cool I don't just mean cool, I mean really cool. It's like, just the other day I was talking to my Dad and he was all ""Mow the lawn"" and I'm all ""Make me"" and then he's all you must have been listening to that Boston CD that I gave you for Christmas, so I'm like all Sha, right! I've been listening to Sebadoh III. And everything is alright with the world."
2,Avoid,"Gracian is a man worth studying, and his Oracle (usually titled something like The Art of Worldly Wisdom) is a must read, but not this version. Do a search on Baltasar Gracian and you should end up on a page by Lachlan Cranswick, which has a good comparison on translations. You will see that many of those in this reviewed version are either weak or missing. I got my copy at a used bookseller for cheap. Not sure it is worth even that price. It did get me searching on Gracian, which has led me to better translations."
3,Historical notes and selected quotes,"The tape flips back and forth between selected memoir passages and 'favorite quotes'. Neither is particularly enlightening, but the determined listener will probably find a few phrases which inspire further reading."
2,It STINKS!@,"I don't know folks, it looks like a nice package, but in it is just a bunch of stuff that you can't use or you don't need! And seriously folks, don't buy cheap, cause that is the price we pay!peace out!"
4,Airball,"Kirby Nikel loves basketball. However he can't play basketball. Kirby joins the basketball team when he learns their seventh grade team will get to meet his idol and former school alumni, Brett McGrew. This meeting is very important because Kirby is sure that he has all the clues to prove that Brett McGrew is his father. The one thing that stands in his way is the school board. They have informed the coach that there will be no team or meeting Brett McGrew if the team can't win the first game of the season. Between the coach and Kirby things just might work out."
4,Maria Costa's Review,"I thought Maria Costa was very funny. Her monologue was universal. It applied to Latina women, Black women, Asian women, white women, etc. Her portrayal of the different characters was 'Right on the money.""She reminds me of Whoopi Goldberg with a Latina accent.I highly recommend this CD for any woman (Or man) who wants to laugh at life."
4,Baldwin is brilliant,"Baldwin's reasoning, deduction and ability to convey deeply personal thoughts with such command and authority are part of what make this book of essays so riveting.In ""Notes of a Native Son"" I began to understand more about the author through his relationship, or lack of relationship, with his father. And in ""Equal in Paris or Stranger in the Village,"" I was transported into a dimension of racial prejudice that I have never experienced through prose before. As powerful today as it was then. A must read."
4,Two thumbs up!,"The book provided an excellent insight as to the troubles facing women, children and families following he Bolshevik revolution. The book is relevant for anyone studying gender issues in the early 20th century as well as those interested in Russian history. The book is extremely easy to read; however, it does at times get bogged down in overuse of statistical data. The data fully supports the author's conclusions, but at times the smooth flow of the book is interrupted by too many examples. Overall, the book was extremely easy to read and provided good historical and analytical coverage of the problems facing women, children and families in post-revolutionary Russia."
5,Fantastic,"I was really in need of these guns and they arrived exceptionally fast. It only took 6 days to get to my FOB in Afghanistan and that's lightning speed considering smaller items have taken up to 2 months to get to my location. As for the guns themselves? I had already been using this model and they work just like they were fresh opened from the factory. Cosmetically they are in amazing shape as well. There are not dents, dings or paint scrapes. I am most impressed with the product. Thank you very much."
3,28 Degree nails are harder to find,"This gun shoots 28 degree nails. They're more expensive than 21 degree or 33 degree nails. Buy a 21 degree round head nailer, or a 33 degree clipped head nailer. 33 degree clipped head nailers hold the most nails, but the 21 degree round head nails hold better, and they're required by code in many places."
3,Bostitch Nail Gun,Didn't use this product.Had to return it.Didn't have any problems with returning the product.Only have a Lowe's Hardware in our town and they have to special order the nails that I needed to use in the gun.
4,Needed a better title...,"This book is not about ""problems"" so much as it is a comprehensive overview of what it takes to become a professional, classically trained pianist. Especially usefull is the section describing a list of basic piano music (of the Masters) to purchase and to study from."
3,Handle with care,"If you've already seen a number of books of this type, you know that these must be read very critically. For basically every conceivable answer to any given question (and some inconceivable ones, too), you'll find a book that advocates this as the only path to true mastery, especially if you add some older books to the mix.The present book, while not patently absurd, strikes me as only moderately useful for the average reader. As another reviewer has noted, it is aimed at very advanced pianists. It also assumes the supercilious tone so commonly found in such books (I for one do have a clear preference for Chopin over Bartok, a condition Newman diagnoses as ""unbalanced taste"").That said, most readers will probably take a few useful bits of advice out of this, so if you, like me, love to read about the piano, consider adding this to your library anyway."
3,Schizophrenic band,"These guys were totally cool but frustrating, too, back in the day. On one side there was a indie-riffy/melodic side that was catchy, rocking, angular and fierce and on the other was a spoken-word, dissonance-for-dissonance sake kind of thing that was totally forgettable. That might have been there Beefheart influence, but if so, they didn't channel the good Captain very well. But they did do wiry, indie-pop excellently. So on this disc you get the first three songs which are hypnotic and tuneful and then the last three which are pointlessly noisy and throwaway.Oh well, this and Color me Babe are worth seeking out for sure."
1,Shamefully bad,"Please read the posts below as well as other posts regarding this company's scores. This is the second soundtrack I have ever bought from this company and have to say that if you listened to the original record, you would get better quality. This cd sounds like they attached their record player to a cheap soundcard and burned it right to a disk. You hear all of the crackling sounds of a record and the actual soundtrack can be heard in the distance. Please! Please avoid!"
3,Is that fuzz?,"A friend and I tried the sweet rice cake despite what he thought was green fuzz all over the cake. Once we tasted it, we discovered it was sugar and that the cake itself was green (the green tea part in the title). It wasn't half bad."
4,Nice Book,"This book is great, I am a sophomore who ordered this too. I used a friend's 4th edition, but it was not good. Then I ordered this edition on Sept 20th and it was shipped Nov 3rd, I think it is worth the wait. I have now gotten it and I enjoy using it and those hilarious comics in the beginning of each unit!"
2,How to Build a 35-40 Ford Street Rod,Very little useful info. Had ordered another book on Model A's put out by Street Rodder and was expecting the same helpful kind of book. Very disappointing!
1,this book sucks,"I was greatly disappointed by this book. I had hoped it would contain information about various ways to build the car, for example the difference between parallel leaf springs, the transverse spring or coil-overs. I had even hoped that they would compare the required modifications for some of the more popular engine choices. It is basically the same information you get in a magazine written by people who visit rod shops and write what they do. It doesn't explain the various build options. It simply presents how one rod shop builds a fiberglass car using a pre-built frame with a crate motor.The title should be one way to assemble a 35-40 Ford"
1,How to build a 1935-1940 Ford Street Rod,"This book is about building a fiberglass car with all components bought. if that's what you want this book is for you, if you want to build an original it is not."
4,How to build a 1935-1940 Street Rod,"Was worth the purchase price but not exactly what I was after, I am satisfied with the book!"
5,"animals, vegetables and minerals a to z",I liked the animals and what they did. my daddy read me the story and it was fun. I specially liked the long dog he looks like my dog he doesn't wear hats
4,THE LAST STAND,George Howard a very talented brother.. was on top of things before his death.. his music will always be left in my heart .. His final stand was this release a very funky version of Sly and the Family Stone's classic There is a Riot goin on album .. he remain pretty true to the orginial work in keeping the same arrangements on most of the songs.. there might be a couple of songs on here that he added his own little touch making it more danceableFav.. CutsBrave & SoulFamily AffiarYou got me Smiling (again)This is a pretty nice last effort from a talented musician
2,Dont use it...,It creates not a nice effect on UWA lens such as my sigma 10-20mm. I never liked the pictures taken with it and have found myself not using it at all.
2,the 300 spartans,"it was o.k ,but wasn't to my liking.the was just too old for me.i like the more up-to-date version better,i only brought this item because it was low price."
3,Spartans,"It is cheesy. Just as cheesy as ""300"", but in a different way. Still, it has a few good moments and t portrays the Persians more accurately."
3,Not as good as I remembered,"Of course, that is because I was a very young child when this movie was originally being played. It's still fun to watch. The acting is marginal, costumes are poorly done and some of the spoken lines are terrible. It's main redeeming quality...it's a good clean movie that is biased toward the admirable qualities in mankind...duty, honor, country. This is something that you don't get to see very often from Hollywood these days.I waited a very long time for this to come out on DVD, and bought it immediately. It will forever be part of my collection, and I will watch it many more times over the years. It's not The Ten Commandments or Ben Hur, but for me and probably many other baby boomers, it's still a ""must have"" movie."
3,Spartans,"I have been looking forward to watching this movie again. I had watched it when I was younger and had enjoyed it. Now that I'm so much older and watching it, it didn't have the same appeal.I love Richard Egan. He was good."
3,Wooden? Yes! Glorious? yes ... yes .. yes!,"As many reviewers have pointed out, the acting in this semi-epic is wooden to the extreme ... with one major exception.It's almost like Ralph Richardson is acting in another movie. His Themosticles is eloquent and truely moving. But his scenes with Richard Egan are almost painful to watch ...As for the rest ... well, this is a movie I saw when I was like 13 years old and it was perfect for me then. Now? I look back with affection, despite its flaws. It's not a great movie by any means, but it's still a wonderful film. I'm very happy to get the widescreen edition at last on DVD (allowing me to retire the old PS version I taped off TV).For a slightly more sophisticated look at the battle of Thermopalye, let me recommend Stephen Pressfield's novel ""Gates of Fire."" It's available in paperback and is a first-rate fictional re-telling of the stand of the 300 Spartans."
4,"Excellent, Classic film","I first saw this movie on TV in the 70's. I still remember it well. The story is a highlight of classical history, yet seldom heard. This is a very well done movie with excellent casting, acting, screenwriting and cinematography.I also saw the new recent version, entitled ""300"", which was also excellent and more stylish, but this original version with Richard Egan and Diane Baker is good movie making.For older adults, I'd recommend this version over the new one; though both are excellent and faithful to the story."
3,Good,"This movie is no modern 300. The action is 60's and the dialogue is too, but this was the film that inspired Miller's creation and for that we have to be thankful.This film has a bit more history to it than 300. They take the time to mention Athen's involvement in the battle and they take the time to even explain how and why Sparta was there, as well as the other city-states. I felt they did well with their version of Ephialtes betrayal, even if it was just very short.The ending left a bit to be desired, but it wasn't awful. It's a fun movie to watch for an afternoon."
3,I loved this as a kid!,This is great although weak in comparison to todays' Mel Gibson epics! Why aren't there more movies made like this today?? Who goes to see the trash made in this era?
3,Don't stop the DVD!,"This has a lot to dislike...say, the first half of the movie. It features some very poor acting. We can also discuss the historical accuracy of the costumes, makeup, etc. So just when I start complaining to myself how bad this one is, it gets to the fighting. The climatic battle scenes are very good, and make this one worth viewing. The 4 star battles bring this up to an overall 3 star movie."
3,Old movie; it is what it is.,"This is an older movie, and that means a few things. It may come off as a little campy to younger viewers. There are no big special effects, no CGI, no elaborate sets. The acting and direction is typical of movies 40 years ago - not slick, and lacking in the intensity you would might find in a movie like Gladiator The Spartans looks surprsingly un-athletic in comparison to the buff actors you's find in Troy or Alexander. It's a little like watching a play that was filmed.All that said, it is what it is: an old movie about the battle of Thermopylae. And if you love watching any movie you can get your hands on about Ancient Greek history, you'll probably get a kick out of it. And I'm not aware of any other film adaptation of the battle, so it may be all there is out there."
2,"Another ""peplum"" (sward and sandal) epic of the era","I saw the film in 1962, the era of italian ""sword and sandals"" epics, this was a little better than usual, mainly for his American participation, they say Greece helped on the stagin of the battle. in cinemascope was OK. for children matinee.The acting is bad and the dubbing is worst.But those films had their charm, and it remains today."
1,The 300 Spartans,"One of the worst movies I ever saw. Attack of the killer klowns was better. Worst than a B movie. Acting was horrorible, story line also stunk."
1,horible film,"This is one of the most inacurate and worst films i have seen in my life! 1)No Horses 2)NO CHARIOTS 3)CHEAP. i had done a report on thermoplaye and this has very inacurate info on the battle. I saw a comic more realistic and i recomend the comic ""300."" i do not recomend this film."
2,Routine but mildly interesting sword and sandal,"The story of how 300 Spartans sacrificed themselves at Thermopylae in the battle against Persia here becomes an only mildly interesting film, though it has its merits: Sir Ralph Richardson gives a good performance as the great Athenian statesman Themistocles, the landscape photography is impressive, and there's a very good score by noted Greek composer Manos Hatzidakis. But these can't save the film from its wooden acting in most roles, a trite script, pedestrian direction, and an unconvincing and obviously tacked on romantic interest in the form of a pair of young star-crossed Spartan lovers.All in all, I'd say this movie would be of interest to people particularly interested in Ancient Greece or in the Hollywood sword-and-sandal epic genre. Others are likely to find it watchable but forgettable. (Triva note: it's the only movie I can think of in which the script includes a few lines of ancient Greek.) The Fox DVD transfer is good."
5,Great Epic/Historical movie!,"This is a great Historical movie date back in 480 B.C. and stars: Richard Egan, Ralph Richardson, Diane BakerBarry Coe, David Farrar plus others. This movie was released in 1962 and is presented in Widescreen format (2.35:1) and is in color. This movie runs for about 114min (1hr 54min) and the video quality is great! I would recommend this to anyone adding to their movie collection."
3,Good for the time,I used to love this movie but I'm afraid to sat time has not aged it well. The acting is basic as is much of the film. Since 300 was released this film is looking more and more dated. A nice overall account of the story but I'm sad to say that 300 is now my favorite 300 film.
1,Bad product,I hoped to have a classy sleeve when I bought this product but it is no where near being elegant. The leather is tough and the sewing is thick. Certainly not for office use. Waste of my money.
3,"Great idea, details aren't accurate","Just a note that everything in this book is a ""truck"" - my 3 year old knows better. The pictures and idea of the book are great, but it was obviously either written by someone that does not have a feel for the details or it was dumbed down for the audience. There are better books out there for the 3 year old audience presenting the material accurately yet at the proper level."
4,Great Book!,"My son is only 20 months old and just LOVES this book! The details in the drawings are so realistic. And it's great that they have both men and women working at construction sites! Too bad it doesn't come in hardcover, as this is a nightly read before bed and that has taken its toll on the paper pages."
5,Great book for boys & girls,"We've had this book since my twins were 2 years old. They both love it. The illustrations are colorful while being realistic; they're actually *better* than photos, because the artist can juxtapose several different trucks in one picture, which would be hard to do with a posed photo.The book addresses suburban house construction, roads, and city demolition and building."
5,Perfect for a curious child,My son loves construction trucks. This book reads like a story book but is full of facts and great pictures too. I would recommend this to any parent whose child has taken an interest in construction.
3,smack dab? too cute for their own good?,"there is some connection between smack dab and another band, but being that i am getting old i have forgotten it. this was a fun, maybe too cute, album that kinda hit on the tail end of that whole love rock thing in the late 80's and early 90's. (would this be a precursor to that whole 'twee' thing?)the lead singer's voice is very unusual and cutsie and may drive you batty after too many listens.but, still a fun album."
5,More gorgeous than the picture shows,"This watch is unbelievable and worth every dollar as it looks like it would cost twice what I paid. I ordered this item three days ago with regular delivery instructions and have already received it. I would recommend this watch for the gentleman with distinctively good taste and style. I promise, you will not be disappointed!!!ebrune@msn.com"
2,Wrong Vol.,I was disappointed in this book because I thought it was the original and was looking for a particular recipe that was not in Vol 2.
3,Stetson,"This book is about a teenager that had grown up in rough time. His father isn't the kind of person that would anyone would rely on. So he's been doing it almost all by his own. Then one day, his life would change forever. His sister that he never met before were before his door.Stetson is the teens name. And his sister's name is Kayla (a fourteen-year-old). whenhis mother left him and his father, his mother was pregnant. Until now, he has never met is sister. Stetson is an very good artist and he could build or fix an motored vehicle. All he needs to do is get a passing grade then he his set.Now read the book and find who the will live there life from now on!!!"
4,great book...,"You have a drunk dad and you work a lot you have this car you really like. One day after work you find this girl in your house turns out she is your sister and your mom died. this is what happened to Stetson (the main character) in this book.This was a great book it had a little bit of everything drama, action, hate, love, and cars. I liked that the author put the car in this book. Stetson really likes that car and I think it symbolizes that one thing you cherish. Something I didn't like was that once or twice the author emphasizes some things a little too much. I would recommend this book the author writes i very well. Overall this was a great book this is only my opinion you maybe agree or disagree but in my case I thought it was a great book..."
4,Fabulous,When I started reading this book I put it down but near the end I could not stop reading.On the positive side it had a great story and awesome ending. Also the characters were not just descriptions they were like real people in my mind they were that good.On the negative side some parts were over dramatized and some parts were to slow. For another thing it took so long for one day to go by in the book I thought it took place over a month.
3,Not enough links on the watch,"I bought this watch for my sister. However, when it arrived, this watch did not have enough links that would fit my sisters' wrist and my sisters wrist is a medium one. As this was a gift it was embarrasing for me!!"
4,"Easy to assemble, OK value",I spent much more time trying to get the set out of the boxes than I did assembling it. The packing foam will make a mess so open it outside. It's low end / cheap quality but it does look impressive. A quality piece would be all welded together and would look more rust proof and scratch resistant. Chairs don't feel too stable. The table has adjustable height feet which is nice. I don't think this would be a good choice for daily use but hopefully I'm wrong. If it lasts a couple of years I'll be happy. I don't think I could have purchased anything better for $200 considering that high quality barstools start at $100 each and these were thrown in with the table.
2,not as good as I thought,I wanted some of the young Sarah during her jazz days. This is a collection of lesser and unknown tunes. I don't think it does her justice. it not the best I have heard from her.
2,Missing concepts,"The auther does provide some nice examples of Java Beans - just about half of the book consists of program listings.Unfortunately, he has absolutely no concept whatsoever concerning just WHAT he wants to tell the reader, or HOW he wants to make himself clear.After having read the first fifty pages (called ""introduction"" by the author), you may well ask yourself one question: ""Excuse me? What was this all about?""Do yourself a favor, and read J.Feghhi's grossly mistitled book ""Web Developer's Guide to Java Beans"" instead - an excellent introduction to beans programming, and a terrific comparison between Beans, DCOM, and CORBA."
2,Essential?,"The value of this book depends on your interests and knowledge in opera. I agree with the previous reviewer on the books' strenghts so let me just emphasize the reasons why I din't like it: 1 - The authors defend their choices by stating that they do not know how to define the 100 best operas so they just pick the 100 essential ones. That seems silly to me. One could have objectively decided what are the 100 most performed or recorded operas and recomend their best recordings. That, I think, would have been a useful introductory text. 2 - Quite aside from the actual choices of operas the chosen recordings are, at times, quite idiosyncratic, just like in the original, full size, rough guide to the opera book. They seem to compensate the choices of modern operas for the ""essential"" repertoire by picking many old recordings for several of them. For these reasons I can not think of any group of people (begginers/experts/occasional collectors etc..) to whom I would recommend this book."
5,Christians get lost!,"I happen to be a Religious Studies teacher in the UK who loves Pere Ubu, Rocket From The Tombs and this lot. God may not say the 'F' word in the Bible but he is quite into genocide (1 Samuel 15) and unaccountably wants to murder Moses in Exodus 4v22. In fact as Nick Cave has pointed out, the Old Testament is a wonderful example of violent literature. In summary, the previous reviewer is an ignorant idiot and if God is omnipresent I'm sure he appreciated the Cleveland scene and the mayhem this band contributed to it."
3,"God, Indeed, does say f-you. On a daily basis, I might add.","Music is okay, a little sloppy and rough. Not always in a really good way. BUT the idiot christian review got my blood boiling. The history of the christian church would truly validate the title of this album. I suppose throwing away leftover frozen embryos rather than saving peoples lives and hating homosexuals because of traits that they are unable to change are better things to worry about than genocide, torture and economic and military imperialism. I can't understand that ANYONE believes in this religion b.s. Don't worry about the earth being trashed and heated up, melting the polar icecaps. Hey, there's gays that want to get married. When you die, you rot. No heaven. No hell. That's it. A long dirt nap."
2,uh....what?,"I didn't care at all for this tribute compared to Violent World. Now while the Violent World may have had poppy new school punk bands covering the Misfits , they did the songs in the same classic vein as the Misfits considering the Misfit's were a little poppy at times to begin with. But this is a handful of Death Metal and Extreme Metal bands covering the Misfits..and they do it BAD!!!!. Also there is two versions of Devil's Whorehouse when it wasn't even the greatest Misfit's song to begin with. However the Helicopter's cover of ""Bullet"" is really really good. Stick with the original Misfits or you can go ahead and go for the tribute album Violent World if you care to hear it."
1,Not the original versions from the '70s - stay away!!,"I ordered this disc because it was the only one in print that included a recording of her 70s disco hit New York You Got Me Dancing (More More More is available on several disco compliations). Alas, it - and the remainder of the contents - are not the original versions, but horrid, recent remakes. Former porn star Andrea True was never a great vocalist, but she was at least passable on her disco hits in the '70s. Now, her voice is completely shot and I wish someone would shoot me for buying this awful cd without doing more research."
2,less is more,"Am I in hell! How many versions of this song do you need? Could have made more mixes of new york... or whats your name,whats your #.I don't need more, more, more."
3,not that bad,"I agree with another reviwer, it's funny to hear how the same artist 're-invented' his own classics, I found it cool indeed!"
5,Enjoyable for the entire family,"The title says it all! Celtic Woman at its finest! Beautiful scenery, surroundings, orchestra and the women! What an enjoyable couple of hours!"
2,Deceptive,"I really enjoy the quality and presentation of all the Celtic Woman DVDs.Now that I've had said that; allow me to to say that I hate to be deceived.Since this was nothing but a montage of the previous concert DVDs, the producers should have made that clear. Yes, the DVD is high quality and the performances are fantastic as they are on the first two DVDs.Since I already have the first two DVDs this was a waste of money."
3,PBS tv...,"Music. arts & such are a very personal experience- live, watch, participate & learn. Do yor best to improve ! Enjoy!"
1,Not Very Authentic,"I do not mind these videos although PBS shows them a bit too frequently. However I do mind that they are not authentic voices. I have been in the performance production busines for many years and it is obvious to me that all of the vocals in this ""live"" concert are dubbed. Meaning that the nicely dressed and coiffed young women are not singing. The voices may be in fact theirs but these are just lipsynching videos. I find that makes them much less authentic. If you have ever seen other Celtic performers ie. Chieftains, it is of crucial importance that the performances be real. These Celtic Women videos are all fluff, the singers look too much like they came off of a Las Vegas soundstage, and, as I said, the lip synching takes away any possibility of an authentic experience."
3,What is on this DVD??,"I am not able to find much information about this DVD. Is it a DVD of a particular concert? or a mix of the other DVD's? I notice there are four new songs on the CD, but very little information about the format or location of this DVD. If anyone knows please post. Thanks"
2,JM,I thought there would be new material on this DVD. I had their earlier DVD's and this had nothing new.
1,Felt abit cheated,"I have always really enjoyed the Celtic Woman dvds, but this one is just a repeat of the first two albums, that I already own. Had I known, I wouldn't have spent the money in buying a duplicate."
1,Celtic Woman - The Greatest Journey Essential Collection,I was very disappointed with this DVD. It is nothing but cuts from their previous DVDs. Since I already have the previous DVD's there was really no reason to purchase this one.If I had know it was only a re hash of the first two DVD's I would not have ordered it. I was hopping to see the new Celtic Ladies but that was not to be. They are no where on this DVD.Buy the first and second DVD's. Don't waste your money on this one.
4,Good Fill in DVD,"I did enjoy this DVD though it wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be. It played well and the video and sound were very good. It seemed to be like a best of album, so if you like things like that you will enjoy this DVD.I rate it higher than the Cristmas DVD, mostly because I din't relate to alot of the songs on the Christmas DVD."
5,excellent collection of Celtic Woman music,"I was first introduced to Celtic Woman's music when I saw their debut concert on PBS. Celtic Woman is made up of vocalists Chloe, Lisa, Meav, and Orla and fiddle player Mairead. All of them are very talented young ladies. Their music is a mix of Irish music and pop music. This CD/DVD combo is a good ""best of"" collection that is perfect for new fans.Tag: music dvds"
4,Vibrant fast-paced music.,"Most of the musical cuts are the same as ""Celtic Women, A New Journey (live at Slane Castle, Ireland)"". We really enjoyed ""A New Journey"" more than this DVD since we viewed the other one first. If you own one, you need not purchase the other. Great entertainment."
1,stardard deviants school nutrition program 2,"This dvd had little educational value, much prefer bill nye or even magic school bus. the dvd was only 15 minutes long and was way too expensive for such a short program."
2,"Not for everyone, flawed in basic ways","I disagree with reviewers who found this book useful for self-study. I would not recommend it for individuals first learning this material. The book is frankly contradictory in places, and frustratingly repetitive in others. In the early chapters it assumes concepts not yet explained, and introduces terminology and symbols that are nowhere defined.If you already know quite a bit, you may find this approach enlightening. But if you're just beginning to master these concepts, I suggest you look elsewhere.I also suggest that much tighter editing would do this book a world of good. Go with Kreiszig, or Lovelock and Rund instead."
1,not an intro - so exactly what is it ??,"Let's be honest. No one could learn forms fromthis book without a professor leaning over theirshoulder. The formalism and exotic notationalone would be overwhelming.To offset this the author should give detailed andsubstantial worked examples (much more than justthe simple ex of polar coordinates as this one does).Furthermore, there are some eccentricities in theexposition such as section 8.9 which is offered asa novelty but which in fact appears in virtually everytext on vector analysis which treats applications.If you want to learn about this stuffand have a much better time doing it,check out John Baez'swebsite and save your money."
3,Good for use as supplementary material only,"The book by Crowley introduces the operating systems while explaining how to design one (just as the name suggests). After every chapter in which on of the OS function is discusses, there is a chapter on how to design these features.The book does not give the operating systems basics. While reading some chapters, it seems that the author assumes that you know the concept. For example, when discussing messaging, nowhere in the book, it is explained what it is, why it is?Most of the code written in the book is beyond understanding. No useful explanation is given anywhere.Apart from that the information provided in it is good for supplementary material. I've used it as supporting book along with 'Operating Systems Concept' by Silberchatz for undergrad course. Some topics like threads, IPC, and synchronization are better explained in the Crowley's book than in the Silberchatz book."
4,must read,A must read not only for OS concepts and design but for thedifferent aproaches to be taken while doing a product development.Gives design considerations and techniques for all the major OS modules in detail and with examples.
1,"Someone light a match, because this book stinks.","It would be nice if the code in Crowley's case study implementation of an operating systems class would actually compile! (With out me having to fix the bugs.) I find the fact that most of the tripe in the book does not apply to any real operating systems. What the hell? References to specific algorithms and how they are implemented in REAL operating systems would have added much to this book. (i.e. Like what scheduling algorithm does Linux use in its virtual memory management and contrast that with what algorithm WinNT uses. Benifits, problems, etc.)Frankly, Crowley's book is too idealistic to be useful. I recomend buying a real OS book! Like the Stallings OS book. Also, the OReilly book on the Linux Kernel rocks! Get the Stallings and Oreilly book, and you will be a OS guru in no time."
4,"Sam Fuller, the storyteller","This is on the surface a documentary about a film Sam Fuller once wanted to make, an attempt on which time and effort was spent, but which for various reasons fell apart. It would have been a fine film, displaying his far-ranging interests and passions and his deep caring for people and their plight. All told, of course, in an exciting fashion with spellbinding action scenes! Romance! Thrills! Excitement!But what makes this film really so interesting is that it really is a tribute to Sam Fuller, the storyteller. His voice permeates the film as he recounts his past and ponders on the future, talking with Jim Jarmusch who follows him on this journey to the village that he once visited while location scouting for TIGRERO.I can just smell the cigarsmoke. And smile when he laughs!"
1,Disappointingly Obvious,"This is a useful book if you've never seen the inside of a house. This is in no way a professional sourcebook. When I opened it up and saw listings- not categories, but individual listings- for ""plywood"", ""carpet"", ""bricks"", and so on, I felt bitterly disappointed. This is not the book to pick up to learn about technical specifications, the advantages and disadvantages of different wood species, or anything to do with the vast array of new materials that have recently come out (3Form Varia, Interface FLOR tiles, molded drywall, etc.) Take a walk through Home Depot instead."
2,Only okay,"Starting off with the promise of ""John's Other"", an original by funky violinist Papa John Creech, this album slides into mediocrity pretty quickly. ""Never Happen No More"" is a great song, but is over busy with harpist Will Scarlett and Papa John competing for space around Jorma, Jack and drummer Sammy Piazza. ""Been So Long"" is a great piece, but was tinkered with in the studio a bit. ""I Want You to Know"" is just another blues piece, and Papa John just overpowers the rest of the band on it. ""Keep Your Lamps"" is okay, but Jorma doing it solo on Double Dose knoock all other versions in the dirt, and again, Creech just overplays.And maybe that's my problem with the whole set: Papa John. Don't misunderstand, I think he added a distinct flavor, ESPECIALLY on Burgers but on the live electric sets (this and Classic Hot Tuna Electric) he gets annoying and repetitive after about two songs.If you're just discovering Tuna, I still recommend Burgers or the first Hot Tuna Live as starting points."
5,excellent...,"Excellent album. I would recommend to either new fans or veterans. They evolve quite well into this album. Mike's vocals have gotten much better with this release as well. Him and Peter play great guitar, and Lopez is a freak as usual. Some might call it ""more proggy"" which might be true, but I think its an excellent relesase from a most excellent band. Favorites are Ghost of Perdition and Harlequin Forest."
5,Altered Mind Material,"Fancy words, a comma or two, some insightful experiences- none are needed. Opeth is from another world full of alien metal-playing beings who sent out their best band to enlighten our lives. That is all."
5,Mesmerising sonic poems,"Relevance is important. Music in our time must be listened to in order to sort traditions and gain perspective. The Swedish band Opeth has achieved a classic work in ""Ghost Reveries"" and they've done so outside the mainstream of the metal hierarchy. In so doing this band has made itself relevant! All of the ""serious"" music of North Americans has deep roots in the European tradition, and this includes the Classical and the Metal genres. Ghost Reveries is not some empty, head banging gesture- rather, it boasts achingly beautiful melodic lines, with clean and lyrical vocals. Each song features imaginative instrumentation and ideas. Opeth uses a characteristic ""voice"" in some of the weightier sections, and it's more like a character in the music, rather than just some heavy posturing.All round, atmospheric, nice dual guitars, epic concepts and sweep - a great outing!"
1,For crying out loud,"This album is basically just like any other death metal album. albet with quite a bit more effort put into it, but still it has that fake ""trying to hard to be scary and demonic"" growling instead of singing. opeth....if you want to be taken seriously as musicians, grow up and stop trying to sound like a scary monster. it's something most people gave up after childhood.....pathetic"
2,Damnation Should have been their Sound Change,I would have thought after the release Of Damnation they would have stayed in that mode of intense vocal feeling. Instead they went back to their old worn out Metal screaming vocal. Ghost Reveries is just plain horrible. Opeth had the feeling and melody with Damnation and that is where they should have stayed.
5,This is a very impressive album,"Yet other improvement. This album is a another major step forward for Opeth because they added a keyboardist to the band and incorporated him very well. It's a step forward because they managed to create another CD without reproducing any song or soundlike anything from any previous album, and in such a way that they creted another masterpiece (in typical Opeth fashion), some say along the line of Blackwater Park. I think it's more comarable to Still Life or My Arms Your Hearse. The Baying of the Hounds and Atonement or remarkable, but every song is its own well-orchestrated piece. It (like very other album of theirs) is for rock fans and every one else. Listen to one song and you'll agree."
5,Opeth's top 3 best albums,"Ignore the guy who gave the album two stars. He must not be atrue Opeth fan, because he has reviews for rap albums. Opeth'snew album is probably in their top three best albums. No, Opethhas not gone mainstream even though they are now on a mainstreamrecord label. Their old record label was a mainstream record company to, so why worry.Now, onto the album the lyrics are probably their best. Mikael has more vocal work - both screaming & singing. You can definitely hear the help of Steven Wilson in the vocals. The newkeyboard adds a new and darker sound to it, as well as melodic. The last song Isolation Years has a musical sound to it. The new album is definitely not mainstream. Would you compare it with Limp Bizkit or Lincoln Park? Ghost Reverise is the best metal album of the YEAR!"
5,Progressive Death Metal defined.....,"If you're tired of monotonous metal music, then better buy this now! All albums of Opeth sounds good!Opeth is not Melodic Metal or whaterver ""Melodic"". They are Progressive Death Metal! Melodic metal bands tend to be so boring that all of them sounds the same."
2,am I the only Opeth fan who didn't like the new album,"Too much synth, too much awkward clean singing, not enough metal. Don't want to call them sellouts, but they have definitely taken their music in a whole new direction under Roadrunner's management."
4,GLAD THERE BACK TO METAL/ACOSTICAL!!!,"Opeth's newest release is a very good interpretation of what this band is. Im actually glad that the band has picked up a keys player (I mean its no like it doesnt fit, its not Dream Theater keys playing so whats the harm). The heavier stuff on this album is really the good stuff. I didnt quite know what do make of Damnation (although very good), it just got boring. Opeth is starting to get boring and i hate to say it. They are incrediable song writers and i think it would be very great if they would release an album that gave us about 5 minutes of metal madness with some structure and solos and a chours lol. I love Opeth but i definatly need to see a change or else im going to lose interest like so many others that already have."
4,Will never be the same,I loved this album to start this review off all the tracks are incredible the only thing i do not like about opeth is that the death metal vocals sound like mikael is trying to sound like a death metal vocalist so hard(i know it sounds wierd but if you listen to other death metal bands you will know what i mean)the thing that opeth did to really make me loose faith in them was something they didnt even do on the record they went to roadrunner records and i think this will cause them to now be a more mainstream death metal band and people will associate them with bands such as lamb of god and lamb of god sucks there in the same boat as all those so called new wave of american heavy metal bands. So all in all this album was another fantastic opeth album but i think future opeth albums will not be the same with the 10+ minute songs i think opeth might try to make there songs shorter so they can be put on TRL.
3,Continuing to proportionally refine,"Many death-metal groups cannot even muster the energy to make marginally compelling music, so it is no surprise Opeth is often cited around the top of many metal lists, a band who has consistently at least attempted to raise expectations as to what a growl and crunch-chord can achieve. But, praising innovative death metal is almost as sadly easy as praising innovative hip-hop, with almost as little true innovation taking place."
3,well...,"I like Opeth a lot, but they really should figure out when to stop playing a section of music. Track five has that part that starts at the 10 min. mark and goes until the end, 1min and 40sec later!! On Deliverance they did the same kind of thing, except it went on for 3MINUTES!!!!!Of course they have long songs! Because they don't know when to stop. I would love an Opeth cd that had a bunch of short heavy songs instead of long heavy songs. The only songs that they ever do short is the mellow stuff and the mellow stuff on this cd isn't the best, it's not at the same level as Damnation.Overall the cd is good. The first track is pretty awesome, one of my favorite songs by them, but it kind of looses steam from there.BUT, even the worst Opeth cd is better than 95% of the music out there."
3,I little disappointing,This is a mediocre cd compared to Opeth's other cds. Compared to the new music coming out these days it is definitely 5 stars. Opeth fans are reading Opeth reviews so I'll say 3 stars.
1,Save Me From This Dissonance!!!!,"I will keep this review breif for times sake this album is nothing specail ,i personaly believe this genre of metal (porcupine tree,nevermore,opeth,dream theater)is nothing special people misinterpret bands like these because thier songs are quite lenthy to be creative and origanal but thier not slow metal that realy can be compared to your nieghberhood garage band .By the way im not a child just too lazy to make a profile . I think that these bands are nothing more than a fad ,who claim to be real metal listeners but would soil themselves if they went to a real concert. It has come to my attention that Roadruner has taken complete control of this band it is also quite evident .1 star for lack of creativity and being a false metal band it has all been done before . By the way Opeth is quite lauphable in concertonly a fool and a enemy of metal music would give this more than 2 stars .You need to get passed the illusion this is all FALSE."
2,Not quite the message I expected,"The illustrations are adorable, but I was a bit disappointed in the story. I thought the book was more about trying new foods at the table, but instead, it's ""eat your dinner so you can get a cookie."" Now I love cookies as much as the next person, but this is not exactly the message I want my toddler to learn. Unfortunately, the book is collecting dust on our shelf. I do recommend the author's books, ""Puppy too Small,"" which my daughter loves and ""Sammy's Special Day,"" which has a great lesson in sharing with friends."
5,I loved this book as a kid..,"My mom read this book to me as a kid, now I'm 21 and can still remember it. We even named our turtle Frieda Fuzzypaws because it was mine and my sisters favorite book back then. :)"
4,An Accessible and Thorough Critical Appreciation,"Stanwood's reputation is high amongst students of seventeenth-century literature, and deservedly so. This book provides an engaging critical survey of Walton's principal works and their place in English literature. The prose is admirably clear and direct. Altogether, Stanwood provides a solid resource on Walton, and a valuable addition to the less-than-vast Walton bibliography."
4,"Bought for 2 songs, but I like the rest, too!","I love Swedish prog: The Flower Kings, Pain of Salvation, Brother Ape, Opeth, Beardfish, Anekdoten, Dungen... and Ritual. This release is kind of all over the place, with harder-edged material and a lot of folk/country influence. I knew that before I purchased the disc and I wasn't sure how I'd like the inclusion of whistles, fiddles, and a Swede-styled jamboree. But it's very cool. Especially like Seasong for the Moonmingpapa!"
3,Okay,"The original basket I bought at the store had five bands, this one only has two. You need five bands!"
3,okay for the price,"I purchased this for my mom after hip replacement surgery. Her waker is the curved in front type, so the basket had to be modified by cutting some of the wires and bending them out of the way. We also used zip ties instead of the velcro. Also, if you cut the wires out of the way, the walker can be folded without removing or disturbing the basket. The plastic insert in nice. If not for that, any basket from a craft store would do the trick."
4,Stability,"This tray is somewhat stable if only they teach you where to wrap it up, but I kinda figure it myself and so far if hasn't fell off yet. And it really help to carry things around. Wish they could come up with the side area that would be great."
3,Walker Basket with Beverage Holder Tray - Walker Accessory,"A wonderful concept for users of walkers, such as my mother. Unfortunately, with the basket on her walker, the walker would no longer fit through the door to the bathroom, and we removed the basket. We finally attached the basket to the inside of the walker--problem solved. Do have to remove basket to fold up walker."
3,Basket & tray for a walker.,"I bought this for a gift, and it is not as nice as the one I got for myself. The velcro fasciner is awkward. I should have looked closer, I assumed it was the same as the previous one. The basket is smaler and the tray is white instead of clear. Fortunately the person I bought it for will not know the differences."
3,Wire Walker Basket,"Don't know if it's the walker I have or the basket at fault, but both the basket and the tray inside the basket sit tilted. The cup holder will hold a soft drink bottle but my coffee mug will not fit. Still, it's better than nothing when I need to carry something from one place to another.."
1,PIcture of item is deceiving,I had to return the item. This basket does not attach to curved fronts of walkers. This basket will only attach to totally straight fronts on walkers.
2,Difficult to get on,"It is hard to get onto the walker and it does not sit up very well. It tends to hang downward. It is connected with strips of velcro. If you need to fold the walker, you have to take each one of these back off again."
1,Don't purchase this !,"This item doesn't even deserve one star.It is so cheap; it comes with Velcro strips to attach and support it against the walker and it doesn't support it well.The ""beverage holder"" is a flimsy piece of cheap plastic."
3,"They're real, but they're not spectacular.","I was looking for the UK band with Chris James, whom I recently heard on DJ Shadow's latest, but mistook this album for that group.The ambient/electronica/jazz mix is smooth and chill, the compositions are good and well produced. It's respectable, but not particularly spectacular.Personally I feel artists like Zero 7, Esthero, Imogen Heap, etc. have done much better with their forays into this genre."
5,A GREAT ADDITION TO YOUR SSC COLLECTION!!,"I was skeptical about the new SSC Doll by Playmates. I really loved the Bandai brand SSC Dolls, so I wasn't too impressed with the look and the appeal of the newest Playmate SSC Dolls when they came out a few months ago. However, my daughter got this doll for her birthday, and I honestly think she is just as cute and even better in some ways. This Strawberry Shortcake doll has a pleasant strawberry scent that is much stronger than the Bandai SSC doll. This doll has long, shiny hair that doesn't frizz when you comb it and your child can style it in so many different ways. Her outfit is hip and seems to be of pretty good quality (some of the Bandai SSC doll clothes ripped and were a bit flimsy). However, she is slightly bigger than the Bandai dolls so the outfits from my daughter's Bandai SSC collection don't really fit this doll. Other than that, I think Strawberry Shortcake by Playmates is a great doll that is worth a second look!"
3,Good product; poor shipping time,"Seller said they would send an email when shipped. They DIDN'T send email; and while item did finally ship and arrive, it did NOT ship by the promised date. Tracking info thru Amazon was no help on this particular item because it was not updated regularly; just showed up in my mailbox. Other than delayed shipping on the part of the seller (Pacific Industrial Components), item was as promised and I was happy with the product itself. I wouldn't advise buying from this seller unless you are not in any hurry to get your item shipped."
2,Cinnamon or Cassia?,"I have been reading up on Cinnamon, it appears, some are not real cinnamon but indead ""Cassia"". Cassia can be hard on the liver so, I am posting this link to a site and you can all read up on it your self and decide what to do. I would love to hear more on this subject. I am ""NOT"" saying to buy from this company but it has good reading and would come more good reading on the subject. www.ceylon-cinnamon.comI was made to put a rating on this product, I did buy and good price but now need to check out to make sure it is ""REAL and not ""CASSIA"". All welcome if know about it already..."
3,not fragrant or flavorful enough,"i bought these to brew in coffee for something different or to use in cooking recipes that called for cinnamon sticks, but find that these are not nearly fragrant or flavorful enough. they get the job done well enough, and the sheer quantity makes this a decent buy, but there's got to be better quality out there and probably wouldn't purchase these again."
5,Fabulous Story,"Love the factual story line! So interesting and unusual, you will be captivated that this actually happened. Superbly entertaining and highly adult in content. If the content wasn't so controversial it would have gotten much wider public marketing."
3,"Good start, but poor follow through","Luke Wilson's movies always start strong. Creative stories, fun acting, good plots. But then they just fall apart. Example: Idiocracy.This is no different. It went from being a fun, playful movie to a dark story with guys and murder and kidnapping and drug lords with Russian accents. Boring. Seen that.Overall, I enjoyed half of this movie. The cliche stuff and 50% of it I did not. Meh."
5,Great movie,"Really good story, a million times better then the Facebook movie, that was all hype. I loved it and recommend it."
4,Very Entertaining,"Kept wondering what would happen next. Great begining, middle, and end. Luke Wilson playing a part i havn't seen him do before. Really good movie."
1,Depressing,Stupid men acting like idiots. Sex is sacred so when nothing sacred is attached to the reproductive system and the pleasure it brings it is degrading. This movie is degrading to watch.
4,Very good film,"Should not be under comedy, but this movie was good. Worth watching. Very entertaining and the story line was awesome, unlike a lot of other action films."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I did not expect this movie to be this well taken -caught my interest the whole time. I was almost about to sleep when I decided to watch this for 10 - 15 minutes, but I did not go to bed till the movie was over. It was good to know how the whole industry came by."
4,The rise and fall of the creators of internet porn is actually pretty good,"While based on the truth, realism wasn't exactly the top priority of director here. A good rise and fall crime story with more humor than to be expected out of this genre of film, this movie is a solid view. It definatly has some replay value but isn't a top crime film by far. Interesting and funny this film is worth a look by anyone who's ever seen porn on the internet. Overall I'm happy to have added it to my collection."
3,wow...really?,"Not a must see production, but I did let it run all the way.......over the top acting does not make a weak story better. A .99 kind of movie..."
2,Nope,"Good actors. Terrible script. You have something better you could do with the next ~2 hours of your life. What's that you say? You live in Northern Siberia, and you are trapped indoors until first thaw? I still say skip it, try eating your own arm instead."
3,Good but the sequel should be better,The movie is an interesting and glamourised take on Chris Malick life. Unfortunately the portrayal of the squeaky clean Chris Malick is far from the truth. I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel where he creates a webmaster payment solution and closes it down and flees with 10/100s of millions of dollars of webmasters money.
2,boring,Not very interesting or entertaining. Seemed they tried to make a movie out of a story that wasn't all that worth telling.
1,Boring,"Crude, cheap humor suited to high school boys. We didn't suffer through the whole movie. There may be a good story here, but it is just not worth it."
4,"Enjoyable, not classic","It is fun to watch, but don't expect the best acting or script. I thought, for some reason, that it would be closer to the real life story. But I wasn't disappointed."
4,Not your average subject.,Based on true events it is an interesting story. Great cast who make the best of the script. Love Giovanni Ribisi!
1,Don't waste your time,"No humor, boring, plot poorly executed. This was a total waste of my time. Do your self a favor and find something worth while."
4,Very interesting and worthy of consideration.,"Frankly, I found this film to be quite interesting and worthwhile. I completely agree with Amazon reviewer Ms. Hansen regarding this movie and her spot-on comment; ""If the content wasn't so controversial it would have gotten much wider public marketing."" (See; `Fabulous Story' 02 JAN 2013. Amazon reviews)Despite all the less than flattering reviews I've noted, I would highly recommend this film for your un-biased consideration and viewing experience. Being the mortal humans we are I suspect this topic is something most of us have already done (or) have thought about doing."
3,What its worth,It had some scratches and skipped a small bit and dragged in certain areas but I did buy it used. But it did arrive on time but next time I will buy new. All in all I got my money's worth.
4,Luke Wilson's characters keep finding themselves in such great prediciments,Luke Wilson plays basically the same character as he did in Old School. He's the regular guy who 10 minutes into the movie has stumbled into a debacle that spirals out of control for the next hour of the movie. Just like in Old School he fixes it all (mostly) by the end of the movie but what a fun story. He is great at keeping it together even under the worst of circumstances. I feel bad for the producers of this movie as it claims to have been made in 2009 but didn't get released until 2011. I think this movie flopped because it tried to be a drama when it should have been a comedy. Giovanni Ribisi's beard was worth a laugh each time he was on screen.
4,Interesting Story,If you have any interest in history of commerce on the net this is a good story even if its not 100% accurate. Just go with it and enjoy.
4,Middle Men,True story that captures you from the beginning with an ending that you do not expect.We've come a long way with the intro of the Internet into our lives.
3,Middle man,Narrative through the entire movie. Not as good as the trailer makes it out to be. It was interesting to learn that this is a true story though.
5,Very good movie,"If you have not seen this movie you definitely should. Interesting plot, stunning characters and some good acting. I have watched it a bunch of times."
2,Despite a great cast Middle Men is barely worth the time,"With such a great cast this seemed to be a solid bet but both my wife and I were disappointed. And how this is in the Comedy section is a mystery. Yes it had a few funny moments but its definitely not a comedy. At the end of the movie we both wished we had made a different choice. As a ""based on true event"" type movie it was interesting but even then you will probably find many other movies that are more entertaining and have better character development. I kept feeling like there were points in the story that were being left out just to make the main character look better."
1,Not original and not JVC as pictured and described,"See the picture of and description of ""Original Lamp"". NOT!!!!!!! Recieved generic box and generic bulb. Seller really should picture and describe the item as to what it is. If i wanted a generic bulb i would have bought one much cheaper than this. JVC is nowhere to be seen on this box or item."
1,Fraud at it's worse,"Do not be fooled. A JVC lamp is stamped on the housing ""JVC."" This is an aftermarket lamp, probably made my Phillips. This is NOT A JVC LAMP. Avoid this person. Amazon know this person is committing interstate fraud, and yet here they are, still committing fraud. Using the postal service to do it is a federal offense. Just buy a Phillips lamp if you want one of those, and DO NOT PAY THE PRICE FOR A JVC LAMP FOR THIS PRODUCT."
2,Doesn't work well for me -- dries and creases,"As a Clinique devotee, I really wanted to like this product, but it just isn't a good one for me. Although the sheen is pretty, it doesn't apply very smoothly on my lids and dries out really quickly. (Incidentally, in the few months since I got it, it also appears to have dried out in its own case; there are two big circular cracks in it where it seems to have shrunk into itself.) I get more creasing when I wear this (alone or under other shadow) than when I wear just other shadow. I have tried using this base in varying amounts, as in applying very lightly to fairly heavily, and haven't gotten a good result in any amount."
1,Not even usable,"When I received my eyeshadow, it was dried up and unable to be used. I was unaware at the time that it should have a seal over it, which it did not. I will not purchase from this seller ever again."
3,Dried out!,"UPDATE: I tried to rub in a drop of water and it didn't work, but when I used it a few days later, the water actually had soaked in and the product was usable again.I Clinique's foundation and moisturizers and love them. However, this product is no good. I kept it in a little plastic baggie and it still dried out quickly. I tried mixing with a drop of water and it wouldn't mix in. Huge waste of money."
1,Completely useless as a primer,"If you want a product that keeps your eyeshadow from collecting in the crease of your eyelid, this is totally useless. It's a nice eyeshadow, but it doesn't work at all as a ""base"" or ""primer."" Honestly, I get worse crease lines with it than without it and will be returning it to the Clinique counter post-haste. If your problem is smudging your eyemakeup, maybe it helps. Couldn't tell you. But for me, it didn't do remotely what it was supposed to do and looked terrible within an hour."
3,"It's okay, but I pass","I read this book because it's my book club's May 2007 book selection. This is my first time reading this author's work and I honestly feel nothing for this book nor the characters. The book did NOT resonate at all with me and I had to read the book synopsis on Amazon to jog my memory. I certainly wouldn't recommend it to a friend as I could barely recall the names of some of the main characters, let alone the central plot or any supporting themes.It also took me awhile to get used to the language and I often had to re-read passages, which is NOT a good thing when reading an unfamiliar and/or new author.The only positive thing I can write about the author is Hopkinson does understand the craft of writing. I also liked how she wove historical elements from the middle passage into the novel as an origin/explanation for the sea people -- very clever. But, these things aside, I am NOT compelled to read previous or future works by this author."
5,Leonard Maltin destroys his credibility with one deft stroke,"I agree with all the reviewers who bemoan the fact that you can only give a movie 5 stars. I also agree with the reviewer who said Leonard Maltin must have had a bad day when he reviewed this movie.This is a movie which, after 90 minutes, has you convinced that it will be the most depressing movie you have ever seen, and then becomes one of the most satisfying movies to be experienced.It is, without doubt, the BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!"
5,wonderful movie,This movie is one of the greatest of all time. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are magnificent!
5,One of the most underrated films of all time,"Probably one of the best films to ever come out in the last 30 or so years. If you want to see a good film, with a great cast, storyline, and one heck of an ending, than The Shawshank Redemption should certainly be on your list. Came exactly as described, and fast shipping to boot as well."
5,never miss this one!!,"it was so great that it still give me a lot of spiritual energy. it shows that living with a hope is so important through one's life. if you've never seen it, just try it now!!!"
5,Great movie!.,"This is a movie you'll love at first viewing, and appreciate more and more each time you watch it. The extra features let you get inside the movie."
1,Worst Movie Ever.,"I'm sure no one's disputing that The Shawshank redemption is a bad movie. However, I would like to go further, and suggest that Shawshank redemption is one of the worst movie's ever made. For starters, it's got Morgan Freeman in it. Morgan Freeman(this spelling may be wrong, but I don't care) is a man of limited talents: he can play a guy hunting a serial killer, and sometimes the president, but when he tries to act he's terrible. And you know I'm right.Two: The film is really boring, goes on forever, covers a span of decades yet the cast never age(Morgan freeman should be dead by the end), has voiceover to explain everything, is really sentimental, everything ends ridiculously happily, he escapes in a stupid way, it actually contains the tagline ""hope can set you free"" and so on and so on.Three: The film's star, Tim Robbins, actually said it was awful. He is right and you are all wrong."
1,overrated treacle,"This paean to middle-aged scofflaws, attempts to persuade the viewer to side with rapists, thieves, and murderers. If Mr. Freeman didn't want to imagine what it was like inside that pipe, then he should avoid viewing this waste of celluloid, I assure you it is 100 times worse. A rampant glorification of gynicide."
1,A special edition of a horrible movie.,"Morgan Freeman ruins this movie with his horrible voice over and acting. If you want to see Morgan Freeman in a good role, see ""Dreamcatcher"". That is an epic film."
5,Great plot twists,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite movies. The first time I watched it, it kept me guessing till the end. Anybody who likes movies with plot twists should like this."
5,Leonard Maltin doesn't have a clue!,If you read Leonard Maltin's review above quickly dis-regard it. This is one of the greatest movies of all time. I personally don't think a movie that is a little over 2 hours long is at all too long for a Oscar nominated work such as this. I never found a boring moment in this movie and the cast and directing was phenomenal. You won't be dissapointed if you buy this movie.
5,"Great movie, shipped quickly, perfect condition",Great movie!!! Definitely a classic. Shipped quickly by Amazon & in perfect condition.
5,Awesome movie!!,This is a wonderful movie and one of the best climaxes I have ever seen in a movie. There is a similar TV series which I like called The Prison Break.
5,Beautiful,"This is one of the most beautiful and uplifting films I've ever seen. The first part of the movie with the ""sisters"" was extremely brutal look at prison life that some viewers may not want to stomach. If you choose to keep watching you will be rewarded however. The movie is the story of an innocent man named Andy who was convicted of brutally murdering his wife and her lover. While in prison, he becomes friends with a man named Red who is the only guilty man in Shawshank and knows how to get things (including Rita Hayworth). Andy becomes a valuable man at the prison because of his skills as a banker (perhaps too valuable for his own good). The friendship between Red and Andy is the centerpiece of the movie. Andy keeps his hope in spite of everything that happens and he gives hope to others, especially Red who thinks he has been in prison too long to do anything else. A wonderful film"
5,Best Movie Ever,"Obviously Shawshank is the best movie of all time--or at least of the 90s. No surprises here. I owned the VHS forever and thought it was time to upgrade. Can't speak to the bonus features, since I generally ignore all the extra content--just give me the movie. Biggest tragedy: Shawshank lost Best Picture to that overblown piece of fluff, Forrest Gump! Great price! Can't believe I waited so long to upgrade!"
2,"Nice, but over-rated.","VERY long, well made TV movie of the week kind-a-film. There's a whole lot to recommend this film, it's well acted, well shot, and the basic story is fine. Problem is, it cannot escape being just another prison-film. It uses EVERY cliche' in the book."
5,Can't get enough of it,My wife and I have seen this movie 5 times on TV and are captivated each time we see it. We are now buying it for our very selective film library.
4,Not really the greatest movie ever made,"The Shawshank Redemption is a very enjoyable film to view. It's simplistic story and stupendous acting should be enough for anyone. Despite having a simple premise, the movie churns out good drama and suspense. This movie also has some good quotes.Overall, I didn't feel like this movie has done anything other than being an enjoyable film experience. It wasn't original or complex, and it didn't really amaze me. Good film nonetheless, but not necessarily a masterpiece."
3,Shawshank Redemption,"Good movie. However, I am disappointed with the liberal slant, unless it is typical practice in the USA for a murderer to go free after 50 years. But, even if it is customary, the writers purposely attempted to make the viewer feel sympathy for the murderer. In addition, by design they made the viewer feel hatred for the prison system and for the people who run it."
3,A good sacharine hollywood movie - but thats it!,"Maltin's review is correct - its predictable - theres another bad prison movie with an overwrought good white guy (Tom Hanks) and Black Guy with a heart of gold out called the Thin Green Line - its called Formula Folks! I saw this in the theatre first and was very dissapointed, i saw the DVD and I saw no reason to change my opinion."
2,Too much movie and too few surprises,"I love Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, but this movie took a very long time to say ""Absolute power corrupts absolutely,"" ""Prison is a bad place to be,"" ""The human spirit is a miraculous thing,"" and ""People can change."" We rented it because we'd heard such good things about it; I guess it makes a nice change if you don't usually watch this sort of movie, but if you've seen other films in which someone is the victim of injustice, you'll probably be bored."
3,It's OK.,Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were super. But the story is really so so. It is a good movie and it should not be rank No. 1 on IMDb.Crawl through 500 yard of sewer pipe people will be killed by the pioson waste gas. For 20 years digging a hole on the wall the posters will be ruined in weeks for him to get in and out. I do not think he can stay in the same cell for 20 years. Inmates moves in and out. Prison will rearrange the cells.They did not change the warden and guards in 20 years is hard to believe. Every inmate has his own cell is not real either.The cells are one next to the other. The hole digged by Tim Robbis will lead to other cell. Not outside world. How did he knew the hole will lead to a waste pipe? How did he know the pipe is bigger enough for him to go through? How did he know the pipe is not metal and he can break it with a stone?
5,Shawshank Redemption DVD,"I ordered a Shawshank Redemption DVD after I continued watching the movie every time it came on tv. It's a great movie that shows perseverance of one person who was wrongly convicted of a crime and spent 20 years in jail. It's a good example of what goes around, comes around and that good usually wins out in the end. There is one scene at the beginning I could do without although it's not graphic it is a little disturbing. If you have not seen this movie I highly recommend it."
5,Superlative Shawshank,"The Shawshank Redemption is a character study in which the audience can develop a healthy and well-earned respect for a man whose spirit will not be crushed. We get to know these people, and writer and first-time director Frank Darabont is able to make us care for them in a way that makes the relatively slow pace of the film more than bearable. Shawshank transcends its genre much the way Cool Hand Luke did all those years ago, but while Paul Newman's Luke was a smiling, hardened con, with a longing for escape, Robbins, in a superb performance, makes Andy's intellect and imagination his salvation. It's a beautiful film that is able to portray the power of hope through the eyes of a rich and rewarding character. A man brutalized but not beaten by a corrupt system."
5,Shawshank Redemption,Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make a great pair. The story line has many different facets and keeps yourinterest as to what happens next
5,Shawshank-The Best Movie Ever Made,"In my humble opinion, The Shawshank Redemption is simply the best film ever. It combines humor, pathos and hope in an unforgettable visual style.The extremely high level of writing and acting combined with the obvious chemistry between Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make The Shawshank Redemption a timeless classic."
5,By far the greatest movie of the decade.,"Frank Darabont's magnificent adaption of King's juicy story is pretty close to perfect. Tim Robbins, not a particularly great thespian otherwise, shines in this film. Morgan Freeman, always better than the movie he's in, finally finds a match for his talent. The story slowly pulls you in, you can practically feel it oozing in through the pores of your skin. And the more times you watch it, the more you appreciate the way the intricate plot unfolds. Also features the best ending ever filmed. If I could give this movie more than measily five stars, I would. Simply astonishing. Can't wait for ""Green Mile""."
5,My favorite film,"If you have not seen this film, then I highly suggest renting it. It grim, the acting is wonderful, and has one of the best endings of any book/movie that I have read or watched. I think I've seen it about 20 times and still watch it from time to time. The pacing is very well done, the music outstanding, and I always enjoy watching it. The message is wonderful, no matter how dark or dreary, no matter how loathsome life can become, there is always hope. There is always a way to get out and start again. The only regret I have for this film is that it wasn't highly considered in the award season because it came out the same year Forest Gump did."
4,movie--not for children,"is a pretty good adult movie.Several sexual/homosexual talking etc scenes that are not for mixed company xcept married.I KNOW THE Scenes are real life stuff, but do not subject kids, adolescents to it. other than that it was a good movie.The seller did a good job with quality and shipping."
4,Awesome Movie,This movie is one of the best I have seen. The actors are excellent and the story is unforgettable. 4 stars for sure!
5,"MOVIE = 10, DVD EXTRAS = 2","as a movie, there are very few, if any, movies that can be enjoyed like shawshank redemption. as a dvd, i was utterly disappointed. it has been said that there would have been commentary by director and actors, deleted scenes, etc. however there is none of that. since trailers seem to be standard on dvd these days, there were virtually no extras. but still, the dvd is one of my favorite based on the movie and the transfer!"
3,good but not great,"This is a good but not great movie. There are good performances, but nothing memorable. The acting is good, but the characters are like cardboard cutouts from other movies about prison. The plot is predicatable. The plot twists would be more entertaining for a grade school child. However, the movie has several violent scenes and language which make it wholly imappropriate for younger viewers.I did not feel that this movie gave me anything to think about. It may have several messages, but none of them are particularly interesting."
2,You gotta be kidding....,"The #2 best movie of all time? Are you kidding? ""Shawshank Redemption"" is formulaic, dumbed-down Hollywood treacle. The heavy-handed Morgan Freeman voice-overs right away indicate that you're in for two hours of safe, sentimental mass-appeal entertainment devoid of any irony or intelligence.The movie's depiction of gays (the ""Harpies"" in the prison) as violent rapists out to defile decent heterosexual men needlessly promotes dangerous stereotypes.""Shawshank"" isn't a horrible movie. It's just a mediocre one that doesn't belong even near any ""Best Movies of All Time"" lists."
2,"disappointed,overly hyped.","After many years of hearing How great this movie is, I Finally saw it. I was very disappointed; itwas way too long, and had the usual hollywood baggage. In 20 years no 1 ever ages. Only 1 prisoner ever admits their guilt. Anyone with a religious view point Is of course a vicious hypocrite. Robbins's Portrayal is so understated as to border on comatose. The climactic development Is patently ludicrous morgan freeman is great. I feel no great interest in ever seen this movie again. this is not even the best movie I saw this weekend, much less of alltime."
4,.,"Thoroughly enjoyable, well-directed, and generally uplifting movie, but you don't have to be an ex-con to realize how painfully far this is from being in any way realistic. It's a fable. But it is a entertaining fable that I can't imagine too many people finding especially disagreeable."
2,Completely overrated,"I have been hearing great things about this 'classic"" movie since it came out in 1994, but only saw it for the first time recently. Even the librarian who checked it out for me vouched for it in the strongest terms (women especially seem to love this movie, for some reason). I found it to be mildly engaging, but formulaic, saccharine, surprisingly vulgar, and painfully cliched. I will never watch it again. For a truly great prison movie, watch ""Cool Hand Luke""."
3,It was okay!,I read the book for class. I watch the movie before the showing of it in class. I thought it was okay. I do love being able to rent the movies over the computer it is like 5 stars convenient.
5,Great Story,"I don't usually like talky movies with little action, but I thought that the story and acting were great in this."
4,The Shawshank Redemption [HD],"This is a great movie that kept me interested the whole time.It is almost 2.5 hours long, but it doesn't seem like it while you are watching it.Even if you don't like Tim Robbins or Morgan Freeman, this is an excellent movie."
5,Excellent movie in all respects.,This is a serious movie that ends on a light note. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both excellent actors who really drive this prison story along nicely. This is one of those movies that you don't mind watching again every year.
5,Excelent Movie,Another well deserved 5 stars for this film! This is one of those movies i will never get tired of watching.
5,One of the best movies ever made.,"Frank Darabont's first movie, this adaption to Steven King's ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" is nothing short of it's Academy Award for Best Picture. The ending was brilliant, only Steven King could think up such a fine ending and only Frank Darabont could make such a great adaption as Stephen King carefully picked him to direct. You will love this movie. Also, if you liked this movie you will also fall in love with the brilliant ""The Green Mile"", also written by Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont. I can't wait untill, Frank Darabont releases his third film ""The Majestic""."
5,Shawshank Redemption,"This is one of the greatest movies ever made. I think the name ""Shawshank Redemption"" probably kept a lot of people fromseeing it in the theatres. It was more or less praised by word of mouth after it came out on VHS back in the day.Highly recomment to one and all. Movies like this are just not made anymore, and I can't figure out why?"
4,good movie,Enjoy watching it. Love how it ends. My husband and I enjoy watching frequently. Enjoy debating the morality points to confronts.
5,The Shawshank Redemption (Two-Disc Special Edition),The films is terrific!!!! and the price in amazon is OK.
5,Amazing,Words cannot describe how masterful this film is. Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman are one of the best duos to ever hit the big screen. They're chemistry together is uncanny. The cinematography is great. The scripting is right on point. And the characters actions are justifiable. Shawshank sucks you in from beginning to end. From the moment Tim's character enters the gates--you feel as though you're being sucked in with him. You feel his pain and you begin to relate to all of the inmates. The movie is very inspirational and offers some form of hope to a brighter better future. I love it. I just love it.
5,A View Inside Prison,"When Andy Dufrain (Tim Robbins?) finds his wife cheating on him he finds himself drunk and ready to kill her and her lover. But his last bit of common sense stops him and he throws the gun in a river. Unfortunately for him on that same night, the murder he intended was commited by someone else. Andy is the prime suspect and is sentenced to two life terms, back to back in Shawshank Prison.Andy finds himself in a cold hard world with nothing but time. Red (Morgan Freeman) is the man that can get you things. Cigarettes, posters, whatever you want he can smuggle it in. Andy approaches Red in search of a rock hammer, the two become friends instantly.Because of Andy's innocence he is restless in prison, being a smart man he always tries to find a way to make his life better.The Shawshank Redemption shows the life of a prison and what the prisoners do to pass time. This is a powerfull film showing the dependence that some people show ti Shawshank, and the defiance of others."
5,An instant classic and one of my top 10 favs!!!,"The SR is one of my favorite movies. The tale that this movie weaves about justice, injustice, redemption and just deserts was done marvelously. Everytime me and my husband come across it while channel surfing we usually watch until the end again and again. Morgan Freeman's voice draws you in and captivates you. And this was Tim Robbins best performance ever. It is the best prison drama ever made."
5,A Triumph,"This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. It shows us the values of hope, friendship, and patience."
5,Only Movie Here That Has Full 5 Stars,"Whenever films are being discussed and good films are being discussed The Shawshank Redemption has become a benchmark. For example if you watch a movie you think is really good you may consider it ""Shawshank-good"", similar to the Godfathers (I & II) but more recent. This is what a truly great film and what truly great acting and filmmaking looks like (so rarely seen these days). If you ever wondered what it is like to be liberated through cinema watch this film and you will understand."
5,A classic,"This film was wonderful. I totally enjoyed the journey to Shawshank. It did not disappoint, and it brought the pages of the book to life."
5,Excellent,"I was determined not to watch another ""prison"" movie chock full of violence and man-rape, but people kept suggesting this movie, so finally at the age of 30 I watched it. I can honestly say I was blown away. Riveted from beginning to end. This movie is a ""prison"" movie, but also much more. If you've never seen it, take a chance."
5,My favorite movie of all time,"I cannot imagine how someone could give this movie a bad review. Sure, everyone has different tastes, but this is truly a masterpiece."
5,"more than a 5 it is like a 10,000","this si most definatly one of my favorrite movies of all time . it has everything is it that any viewer will want to see . the whhole movie is about a man who is thought to have mudered his wife because she was having a affair . this happenes in the begining . throughout the whole movie you are able to see what a real life prison is like . this includes all the griddy details such as gayness among inmates , death , beatings , punishment , and many other detailed things . even though this movie has many unwanted desciptions in it there are many sceens that will make the whole movie worth watching . if you have not seen it is awsome and i highly recommened it to you ."
4,Nice,"Great movie, Quality is great just which the audio portion was a bit better in regards to the dolby sound over all 4 and 1/2 stars"
5,What an incredible film,This movie is worth every penny. So many different emotions throughout the film but by the end will make an impression on the viewer.
4,"Great film, but best film of all time? Gimme a break...","This films is perhaps the only example of a film based on a book, that is actully slightly better than the book (novella really but who's counting hehe). I saw this one in the theaters years ago, and loved it. It's an inspiring story about redemption, but it is *not* the greatest movie of all time, sorry. Top 100, no doubt, top 10, no chance. Either way, you should love this film, almost as much as the 700+ fanatics that posted below me, so go out and buy this fine film and add it to your DvD library."
3,The Shawshank Redemption,Worth buying for the film alone. A great story and a well chosen cast make this film a winner - the only problems are the poor picture qualty and the lack of extras on the DVD.
4,Robbins' Redemption,"When I first saw this movie, I had no idea what I was in for. Tim Robbin's portrayal of Andy is spell-binding. His voice is calm and even, almost monotonous, yet you see the wheels constantly turning. The twists at the end were especially clever. Morgan Freeman's character, Red, was an accurate example of a man in prison and his refusal to look for hope. It was also interesting to see how the once tough-in-prison Red became the mild-mannered grocery bagger after his release, even forgetting that he didn't have to ask permission to go to the bathroom anymore. Some complained of the length, but every minute was interesting and enjoyable."
4,No Commentary as Advertised,"Of course, if you've seen the movie, you know it's good. But, contrary to what the advertisements about the DVD state, there is NO COMMENTARY of any kind. I don't know what happened, but I was disappointed with that. Other than that, the transfer is clean."
5,I never saw it coming...,"I had heard many good things about this movie before I finally decided to rent it in the summer of '98. This movie is amazing, to say the least. I did not anticipate the surprise climax...it was so clever and it is what sets this movie aside from the other prison movies. And like so many others, I was shocked to hear that it was written by Stephen King of all people. Just goes to show that the quality of King's dramas rival even his best horrors!"
5,One of the best movies ever!,"This movie will surely make any heart weep with joy and emotion. It centers around an innocent man triumphing over violence, sexual abuse, and emotional and spiritual devastation that haunts his prison-bound existence. Robbins and Freeman move the viewer with subtleties and friendship and give the performances of their careers, making one of the best duos in movie history. A must see for any one who understands the lows and highs of life."
5,A real picture of the inside's inside,"There was reasonable doubt in the guilty conviction of an innocent man condemned to life in prison run by corrupt officials. What else is new; it's not just in Mexico or some thrid world country where this happens (hopefully it won't happen to you or me). The details of this movie are astonishing, at times unpredictable and filled with surprises. A colorful example of how the American system of justice however blind can be dumb and perverted."
4,Great movie,Too bad I found out we already owned it after the package arrived. Either way though it will make for a great gift for someone else.
5,TSR,"What can I say, this is a great classic movie, with the culprits being those who run the prision. A classic well worth adding to your movie collection."
4,great classic,"The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it is 2 hours and 22 minutes long, and builds slowly. I liked this very much. My students, however, were mostly unable to concentrate on a movie like this. It is a sad commentary on the attention span of the social media generation, but I think my students are fairly typical and that many readers will want to know that if you are not a reader as well as a movie-goer, you may find this a bit challenging."
4,Thought provoking,This was a great movie. It really made me think about our criminal justice system in America and all the innocent people that have been put behind bars. It's really too bad.
5,The most well-made movie made!,"Tim Robbins stars as Andy, a banker who is put into prison and on the way finds trouble and some friends. He becomes great friends with Red (Morgan Freeman), and their friendship builds up in the movie till it reaches it's maximum peak. This movie is a ""Total Triumph"", and probably the best movie of the century. I have been writing stories so I can make movies when I'm older and thought I could make some of the best movies ever. But I would never make a movie near as good as this one. It's mainly a prison film which suprises viewers. Great acting by the main actors, and in my opinion should have won 'Best Picture' and many other awards it was nominated for. I gotta say Stephen King is an excellent writer. Watch this movie!"
5,A movie about freeing the captive spirit...,"Once upon a time I lived in an old crappy two bedroom apartment in one of the most rundown areas in San Diego with two roomates...They didn't pay rent and they never made me pay either. One of my roomates, Andrew, said that this was his favorite movie of all time. i had never seen it so we rented it and then I understood why...He wanted to get a little pickhammer and chisle his way out of the ghetto...He would've had to go through about two feet of concrete and then he would end up in the garage...if he was lucky, it would be unlocked. If not...well, I'm sure ol' Andy would figure somethin' out."
4,Jail Movie,I bought this movie a while ago i believe that this is one of the greastest jail movies ever maid. Morgan freedman was phemoninal this movie was his best role... Tim ribbins did an awsome job this was his greatest role ever.. i reconmend this movie to everyone and anyone... again this movie rocks and one of the best movies ever maid....
4,I preordered this for the commentary...,"...only to find that when it arrived, it had none. I almost returned the DVD, for this was the sole reason I ordered it. But because the film is one of my favorites--far superior to the racist, treacly Green Mile--that I kept it. A testimony to a work of art triumphing over false advertising. Shame on Warner Bros. for dropping the ball not giving this fine film a DVD with the embellishments it deserves. Memo to the Amazonians: please correct the description of the DVD before more people order a product that you cannot deliver."
5,Shawshank,Great movie. We enjoyed it so much. It's one that you can watch over again. It's definitely one of a kind.
4,Awesome,Sent fast! Go it fast in the mail. Will love to do business with these guys again! It's also an AWESOME movie.
5,Excellent!,"This is a keeper for you video collection. It will make you laugh and cry. A wonderful movie. Some sad moments, but they all work themselves out. Great to keep and great to give as a gift. Based on a short story by Stephen King."
4,Great Movie!,"This movie was wonderful. Each character was fully developed and realistic. It gives the viewer a good glimpse at what prison life might be like for inmates. Morgan Freedman, especially as a narrator, was fantastic. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a movie with a good plot that keeps the viewer tied to the screen till the final scene(which was directed perfectly, by the way). Compared to the last several movies I've laid my hands on, this one, by far, puts them to shame."
1,"This is NOT widescreen, check for yourself!","My third submission on this, if you are doubtful, check for yourself. I own the VHS of Shawshank. I recently purchased a DVD player and Shawshank was one of my first disks. I set both the disk and the tape up to play simultaneously, and flipped back and forth to compare the superb quality improvement of DVD. I was in for a surprise. The picture DOES NOT get wider-AS IT SHOULD-and the top and bottom of the picture of the DVD version are ERASED and replaced by the black bars. The other movie I found with this flaw is Jackie Brown. Check out the point where Bridget Fonda ""services"" Robert DeNiro. On the VHS widescreen version , her ""buns"" disappear. They are fully visable on the fullscreen version! The top and bottom have been erased on the widescreen version and the picture does not get any wider. I suspect more movies have this flaw. Now that we know what to look for, let's look!"
2,"The ""F"" Word Strikes Again","I've seen this movie on television several times and enjoyed it greatly. A good story of triumph over adversity, however when I purchased the video I was greatly disappointed because the notorious "" F "" word ruined the writing for me and the acting as far as I'm concerened. Thats all I could see or hear and it ruined the quality of the movie for me, my husband didn't even enjoy it as much. It's a shame that a briliiant actor and director had to fall victum to the use of vile language when it was proven by the television version that it was completely unnecessary to the impact and story line."
1,Conned by the retailer,Another victim of false advertising. I ONLY ordered this for the audio commentary (like all the DVDs I own) and there's nothing! Mine's going back for a refund!
5,Great Movie,"I bought this movie because I read the book Differnt Seasons (by Stephen King) that has this story in it. The book was great and so was the movie. The plot is the same but the story is a little differnt in the movie. This is one of the few movies as good as the book. My only complaint is that the movie would mot play on Windows Media Player on my computer, instead I had to install InterActual Player. I personaly did not see the point of that."
5,Great!!!!,"This film is just great, everything about it, the plot, the actors, how is made, this is an incredible film. I just got surprised how can the Academy Award honored Forrest Gump instead, this is a film that really makes you think, it makes you cry, it makes you laugh, and it just makes you feel great. 5 stars all the way, one of the best movies ever."
5,One of the most incredible movies I have ever seen,"I have seen this movie about 30 times, mainly because TNT shows it every two weeks. Really good movie to buy, cause you will watch it over and over again. this is the plot summary - ""Tim Robbins plays a banker named Andy who's sent to Shawshank Prison on a murder charge, but as he gets to know a life-term prisoner named Red (Morgan Freeman), we realize there's reason to believe the banker's crime was justifiable. We also realize that Andy's calm, quiet exterior hides a great reserve of patience and fortitude, and Red comes to admire this mild-mannered man who first struck him as weak and unfit for prison life."" Overall I think this is one of the most entertaining movies of all time and has one of the best endings ever recorded on film.A+"
5,One of the BEST movies EVER!,"This is a great movie about hope & friendship & justice. It unfolds as it needs to. You get to know the characters & you start rooting for them. Morgan Freeman & Tim Robbins are stellar. I've watched this time after time since it was released, and I always catch something new. I recently visited the Mansfield Reformatory where this movie was filmed, & it was like reliving the entire movie. Go there if you get a chance. (The Russian prison scenes in Air Force One were filmed there, too.) The prison is haunting, disturbing, and gets into your gut, just like the movie."
5,Extraordinary Movie Making,"I've watched this film umpteen times now and never tire of it's wonderful composition. Everything about it is just enchanting; the script, the photography, the acting...I could go on...It's a film that truely moves you and offers amongst the most compelling viewing I've ever experienced. Miss it and die unfulfilled."
5,Do yourself a favor and watch it.....,"If you haven't seen this movie, you have too. Classic. One of the greats. No matter who you are or age or anything, you'll love it. That simple. I don't wanna give away the story though."
5,Hope.,"All time favorite movie. I am not a critic, just a guy who watches movies. I will not talk about the screenplay adaptation, or the score, but merely the single most important part of this movie. Hope. This movie has given me something that I now carry with me. The line ""Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'"" is the absolute truth, and hearing it has given me something to do now. Get busy livin'. There is hope in the world, and this movie has shown it. A must see in my book, and one that I watch whenever I feel there is nowhere to turn. :-)"
2,The Shawshank Redemption,Order was received sooner than expected ... in excellent condition. Was very pleased.
2,AWFULLY BORING!,"This movie must have been one of the greatest snores of the decade. It just did not have any substance to it. I was hardly riveted to my seat as I was watching this. The film was very slow and there were very few parts the I actually enjoyed. I do not know why this movie got high ratings.... but for me, it was one of the worst in some time."
3,How does Red get all that stuff...,"This a movie about Andy and Red two inmates at Shawshank Prison.Andy is busy plotting his escape and Red is busy getting little treats for the other convicts like a pick ax, a poster, a Big Mac, a tube of Ben Gay... the movie never does explain how Red is able to come up with that stuff."
3,Criminals' Rights,"I have to admit, I loved the idea of 'The Shawshank Redemption' ... an innocent man convicted by the evil fascist state of a murder he didn't commit, even though overwhelming evidence places him at the murder scene. What's more prison is a wonderful communist paradise where all the felons are perfect angels and martyrs of the state. That's perfectly wonderful. What I couldn't stand however was the worship of individual determination of perseverance that was idolized in this Hollywood tripe. That main character guy was terrible. Didn't you just wish the sewer rats had gotten to him? I know I did!"
2,Dissappointed,"First off let me state this is my friends favorite all-time movie. I had such high expectations but feel I was let down. Slow moving, felt like the movie was ""floating"". The acting was well-done. but moving it wasn't. O well to each his own. I am a comedy/horror fan. I enjoyed Morgan Freeman in ""SEVEN""."
5,See it to believe it. You'll root for the bad/good guy.,"Growing up, did you ever get accused of something you didn't do? What if you went to prison for it? How would you feel?How would you feel, stuck inside a prison with many other folks, most of which could be classified as psychopaths? How would you feel if death and rape and truly evil people were the penalty for a crime you didn't commit?Kind of like the star of this movie...This movie covers a mans journey into hell, the cruel treatment at the hands of his jailers and his fellow prisoners, the friendship between him and his one true friend, and final redemption from the worst that true institutionalization and cruelty can bring.There's so much wonderful feelings in this movie. Lots of reasons to own this one.Get it."
4,One of my 20 favorites,"Although I don't seem to love this one as much as other film enthusiasts, it is one of my 20 favorite films of all time.And the DVD is well worth it."
5,Raquel,This isn't so much a remark as it is a question. Am I the only one who has ever wondered how Andy got the poster of Raquel back up on the wall after his great escape?
3,Movie was great,"But Server kept resetting. Got so annoying we had to stop watching it and come back to it the next day. If you're going to stream movies, make sure you have the capacity to do so. Amazon is really starting to tick me off!"
2,So much for the special edition.,"I payed extra for the special edition copy of this movie, which came with the movie and a metal cover case. When I got the movie it was in a cream colored sealed envelope, when I opened the package the case was so crushed I couldn't even get the movie out to watch it. I guess the extra money I paid for the special edition version was to protect the dvd from getting broken, cause if it wouldn't have had the metal case the dvd would have definitely been broken when I got it."
4,shawshank redemption,it is such a great movie that a have seen a hundred times and would see it a hundred more times.
4,The Shawshank Redemption,"I've seen parts of the movie at AMC and have been wanting to see the entire movie. It's not available in netflix so I bought it here. Great movie, love the plot and life lessons."
5,judge8000@aol.com,"I have just returned from county jail, where a inmate(friend) told me that I have to see this movie. I have just finished it, and I believe that this movie should be in everyone's library. It really shows you a story about life. I would recomend this movie to anyone- that wants to put a smile on their face."
2,"Great Film, Less than stellar DVD","This may be my all time favorite film, which is why I have the most trouble understanding why it recieved only minimal treatment in the DVD format. With all the great ""Special Editions"" and ""Criterion Collection"" films that have come out, films that are worthy of true in-depth exploration, why hasn't Shawshank gotten its proper DVD release for the people who love this film. I try to get the most for my DVD dollar, and love DVD's for the ""behind the scenes"", ""making of"", ""directors/actors commentary"" ""alternate endings"", ""storyboards"" special features. Shawshank doesn't have any of these to speak of....just production stills and trailer. This edition is really a glorified VHS copy, and that is a true shame....a big let-down for me."
5,Best movie ever made.,This rivetting tale based on a Steven King novella captures the greatness of a man when faced with troubles behind the cold walls of Shawshank prison.
5,One of the 1990's top 10 films,"Being a Stephen King fan, I first read the novella upon which ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is based when I was 12 and immediately considered it my favorite King work. What amazed me is how Frank Darabont not only remained faithful to the book but made it his own and, more importantly, into one of the decade's most moving. There's great poetry in Morgan Freeman's voice and the last 15 minutes of the film absolutely reduced me to tears. I can't wait until the DVD version is released so I can appreciate the film in all its splendor."
5,Full Greatness,"The only great year of the academy awards. Too many great choices with the worst of the bunch winning. Same as the year of the boat. Me and a fellow critic who I admire were just talking about Morgan Freeman's performance. It was outstanding, only seen by him in one other film(Seven). A film like this deserves a better version on DVD though. This is the feel good movie of all time. It is a story of the human soul and spirit and overcoming things that keep your inspiration down. If I could own just fifty movies, this would definitely be one of them."
4,Must Have Blu-Ray,"This is not a review of the actual movie, because Im assuming that if your looking at the blu-ray that youve probably seen the movie in the 14 or so years its been out. But what I will say is that this movie is a great movie, an awesome story, with good direction from the same man who directed The Green Mile (Frank Darabont). The picture with this blu-ray is very good, which is the largest thing your looking for on a blu-ray, and the sound is also meets expectations....A Must Buy"
5,Not sure how it took me so long to see this movie.,"Anyway, my fiance really wanted me to see this movie, and how could I pass up a Morgan Freeman movie with his sweet seductive narrative throughout the entire movie. Sadly, I had seen so many parodies of the movie or just parts of it (Simpsons, Family Guy) that I already figured out the outcome. Regardless, it was still a really great movie and both Tim Robbin and Freeman did an amazing job in it."
4,Good looking back,"Chuck Berry is one of my old favorites. I danced to his music when I was a teenager. This CD contained many of my favorites from back in the day such as Johnnie B. Goode and Almost Grown. Also, some of his less known music was introduced. Havanna Moon was a surprising musical treat."
3,Great Music - No Energy,"My parents used to have a live chuck berry album and I loved it. I bought this thinking it would give me that same feeling but I think he was just a better performer - the energy is more tangible in the live performances than on the record.All the songs are great, but now I kind of want to get a live album because this seems so much more dull in comparison."
5,Great travel product,"This is a great addition to you packing accessories, The tube will hold a weeks worth of socks, and I use one for computer and phone charging cables."
1,A Waste Of Money,"You can find everything in this kit at Home Depot, or even Big Lots, for about $20. Take the rest of the money that you saved and get a set of feeler gauges and an appropriate radial gauge for your guitar brand. Neither of which comes in this overpriced set."
2,Maybe a bargain... at 20 bucks,"For how much I paid for this I feel kind of ripped off. The main reason I got the kit was for the ruler/ strait edge, which was so thin I bent it getting it out the package. I can see the tremolo pic coming in handy for a floyd rose or Strat type trem, but far from nessesary. The winder works, but its a cheap piece of plastic. I cant imagine what guitar truss rod could be adjusted by the allen wrench set, 4 wrenches all too small. About the only things worthy on this kit are the string cutter and mini mag, which I suppose could come in handy for an emergency repair at a dark gig. Oh they through you a two sided screw driver incase you didnt have one of those. Fast shipping though."
2,GImate Pro,"Nice box, let you have it all together, and avoid you missing any item, but too expensive for the tools that brings inside.You can buy everything separately much cheaper."
3,Mixed results,"I actually bought 2 of these (one for each grandchild). My son and his wife love it for traveling, becauser they don't have to bring a separate stroller, but we found it difficult to use in our car with our grandson. We are olderr and it was very awkward for us to set up and use the stroller portion. We DID use it for about a year as a regular car seat, but he started to be taller than the back ( at 2) so we bought another seat."
4,Worth the investment,"We have used the Sit N Stroll system on two trips and found it well worth the investment. The ability to act as a stroller as you enter the airport, switch to a seat on the airplane, back to a stroller at luggage claim and into a car seat in the rental car was everything we asked for.There will always be issues. Multifunction devices never have the quality that an individual car seat, stroller, etc. would have but we are willing to look past that for this very practical device.You may have issues with an airline employee about the seat on the plane but stick to your guns. You'll usually get it on the plane. It is technically bigger than the seats on the regional jets and DC-9 we have taken it on but made it work. In the rear-facing mode on smaller planes the seat in front of the Sit and Stroll will not be able to recline.If you travel with an infant or very young child this is well worth it. Keep perspective on the fact that it is a multipurpose device and you'll be OK."
4,"Very helpful, but...","I bought this for a 20 hour trip from Alaska to Mexico. It was very helpful!Pros:Easy to change to car seat to stroller and vice versa.5 point harness, it is almost impossible for my son (2 year) to unclip it.Fabric is easy to clean.Cons:It does not fit in the airplane aisle, I had to carry the seat and my daughter (1 year).The fabric made my daughter sweat.Difficult to strap in.It's kinda ugly."
2,There's a better alternative!,"My husband and I looked into buying this for our vacation. While it looked good, it just seemed like a lot more gear we were bringing with us! Something we were trying to avoid!Yes, it's a car seat, but then you have the wheels attached and the handle, etc. We just wanted to make our trip (& life) easier. We found the TOTEaTOT. It serves the same purpose, but I think it's better. It's two straps, with a built-in backpack, that attaches your child's car seat to your suitcase with wheels which we use as a carry-on.It's a fraction of the price! Just $25. And so much less gear to bring, and we used the backpack once we got to our destination. www.toteatot.com"
2,Does not fit down the aisle in coach,"Despite the description on Amazon, this stroller does not fit down the aisle in coach. Standard aisle width is 17"" and this thing is wider. You need to actually carry it over the seats and heads of all the other passengers, in my case with my child still strapped into it with my carry on bag over my shoulder. The manufacturer apparently makes no claim on their website that it fits down an airplane aisle, neither do they tell you how wide it is. I don't know why the description on Amazon says it fits. Do not buy this if you want to roll it down the aisle of an airplane."
2,Easy to convert.....NOT!!,"At 6 months old our son grew out of his travel system car seat. Since we travel a lot, we thought the 5 in 1 travel system would be just great. The conversion from car seat to stroller works well empty, however as soon as we put our 9 month old who weighs 21 pounds in the seat, the conversion was extremely difficult. The manufactor says it can be used up until 40 pounds....no way."
5,Tested and True,"We have had our sit-n-stroll for almost 4 years. It is best used as a travel stroller, due to the use of the shoulder harness, however I have it works great with sleeping babies. My son would fall asleep in the car seat, and I could take stroller and all in the house and not wake him. Overall a great investment for anyone who travels more than once a year."
3,car seat/stroller,"This was a very useful car seat-combination-stroller. The problem I have with it is that the seat belt straps cross over the child's chest for securing the seat into the car and airplane seat. My two-year old, surprisingly, did not raise objections to this, but I imagine that could become a big problem. Also, the airplane seat belt straps just barely were long enough to strap in the seat. In addition, sometimes the mechanism that brings out the wheels and retracts them stuck. This was very inconvenient in the security line for the airport. On the plus side, the stroller moved very smoothly."
2,flimsy as a stroller,"I found the product highly unsafe as a stroller. The handle is very flimsy, and is not strong enough to control the direction of the stroller. Also the wheels do not lock properly and safely. Its ok as a car seat but as a stroller has a lot to improve."
2,Not for everyday,This is not for everyday use. It was a little heavy for me. Especially while trying to convert it into a stroller while my baby was in it. As he grew I would make him get off to convert it which defeated the purpose of the carseat/stroller combination. The handle doesn't feel sturdy enough. After a while I used it just as a car seat and used a separate stoller.I can see how this would be useful for the frequent travellers.
4,Great concept but a few drawbacks...,"We recently purchased this for our 11 month old as we do a lot of travelling and found it a hassle to cart around a carseat and a stroller every time. It is a fantastic alternative--very comfortable, strolls easily, converts easily once you get the hang of it, and very convenient. We do, however, have two complaints: (1) It does NOT work well rear-facing. We would not recommend this if your child is still rear-facing as it is very difficult to secure in place. We ultimately gave up and turned our daughter around even though she was only 11 months old. (2) It is awkward getting our child in and out since the part that secures the seat to the car goes over the top of her. Basically, we have to unhook the LATCH buckles every time before unhooking her from her harness. Doable, but awkward and annoying. Nonetheless, if you travel a lot with a little one, the conveniences far outweigh the drawbacks."
2,One unfortunate problem!,"It's a shame, this is an otherwise a great product. However, unlike regular car seats that strap into a car from the back so that you can leave the car seat in a car and take the baby in and out without much trouble, this seat requires the seatbelt to strap OVER the baby! This is not only uncomfortable for the child, but a hassle because the seatbelt has to be undone and redone each time you get out of the car or every time you take the child out of the seat in the airplane. This may not seem like a big deal, but reaching over the child every time to find the buckle can be difficult and time consuming, and very uncomfortable to the child. I will not use this car seat again, I am very disappointed."
2,"Great for the plane, but annoying for the car","I purchased the Sit & Stroll when we took our 11-month old to Hawaii. It was awesome in the airport. Very convenient to get the baby from the car and to the plane, and very convenient to be able to install the seat on the plane.However, once we got off the plane, it got annoying. The seat was difficult to install with a seatbelt (much better with LATCH). But the part that was really annoying was that the straps that secure the seat to the car go OVER the baby. This means that you can't easily leave the seat in the car and just take the baby in and out of it.If I was making this purchase again, I would purchase a dolly/cart thing for my Britax car seat and just take that.The concept is great, but practice is klunky."
3,Just got it...but...,"I am not sure yet, we just received the Sit N Stroll because I want to use it for a trip this week to San Diego. We will be in and out of hotels, flights and rental cars, so I want something easy. Anyway, I am not sure if I want to use it now because it didn't come with any sun shade and Babies R Us doesn't sell it online. In the summer months and in sunny destinations, I feel a sun shade is a must. So, who knows. It is very easy to convert to a stroller and is simple to manuever. We just have to see how easily it will be installed in/out of the rental car...I guess I am a bit disappointed that I can't buy a sun shade very easily, I think it should either come with or be offered by the retailer who is selling the Sit/Stroll."
4,"Essential for travelling, overall","I like this product, it's nice to keep the baby in the seat as you go from the car to the restaraunt/airport/whatever, although it does take some strength to lift up the seat and extend the wheels with the baby in it. Baby is also very low to the ground when in stroller mode but I never cared. It's a good combo. And I think it's the only combo.On planes, It *does not* fit through the aisle in coach class, you have to lift the seat over all those other seats, with the baby in it (whew). If baby has his own seat you don't have to use it rear facing, the flight attendants will ask you to face it forward no matter what the baby's age.There is also no storage space, really, as in traditional strollers. However for sheer convenience, I do recommend this product!"
2,Strapping design is dumb,Just look at the user guide menu. You will not want to strap your baby down like the way they present in the menu. I don't think any baby can feel comfortable with all the strapping over their shoulder and another strap around the baby seat itself. It's just dumb.Unless you want to pay $250 for a stroller only.
4,Sit n Stroll - Love it for the right reasons,"I do love the sit n stroll. We used this when our son was 6 months old and at 16 months and it was a dream. You just have to be use to taking the child out of the seat before you collapse it into a car seat. We only used this for the airport and car rentals. We already had a stroller at our destination which makes things a lot easier. So using the Sit n Stroll for the Airport, Flight car seat and Rental Car Seat is the optimal way for us in having this a success. We have used other solutions such as the CARE seat belt which is also awesome, but our son is still to small not to use the 5 point harness.We hope this helps other parents."
4,Car Seat Stroller great for traveling parents,"I love this car seat stroller. It goes from car to airplane in no time flat. Great if you travel with small children with just one adult. Also great if running errands and your child falls asleep, no need to wake them up to get in and out of the car. However, the older they get and the more they weigh the harder it is to get the whole thing in and out with them in it. I still love this product."
2,Bad experience,"This travel system is a good idea. However a wheel broke off on our 2nd flight, probably due to baggage handlers, so would not buy this product again."
4,GREAT!!!,"Everything you need in one! Takes a little getting use to and hard to use in bad weather, but other than that it works great. Although if you're tall it might be a bit of a reach to the stroller handle bars. I'm 5'6"" and it works for me!"
5,Perfect for Travel,"We have used this carseat/stroller for all airplane trips for the past 2 years. It is wonderful and we get a lot of questions from other traveler's with children (while they carry their car-seat and push a stroller). It takes a little bit to learn how to use it, but once you learn...it's a cinch. I can still lift it with my 34lb son in it and retract the wheels.We did attempt to have Grandma use it as the carseat in her car. But, since you have to ""install"" it each time -- it's just too much for her. But, for trips it really is indispensable."
1,actually negative 5 stars....DO NOT BUY!,"This product was terrible. First and foremost this seat did NOT fit on American Airlines Business Class seats! Secondly, the rear facing car seat tilts so far forward that your baby is falling forward agains the harness and if they fall asleep their face is pressing against the seat belt. The wheel covers fell off the first time I used it. The stroller is a piece of junk. When I called the company to explain my problems they never even called me back, so on top of it all they have a horrible product and terribel customer service to match. Do not buy."
1,Not worth the price,Sure it's ok for travel but we had trouble lugging it through airport security. We had trouble folding it up every time as the wheels would get stuck. You need to be strong to lift this thing out of a car and forget about folding it with a child inside. The wheel covers finally broke off and only then could it be folded easily. The handle is very flimsy and does not extend high enough for a person who is 5'10''. If you're tall you will be hunched over trying to push this thing. It does not roll smoothly on carpeted areas and tends to wander so you are constantly trying to steer this thing with a flimsy handle. You will be totally worn out after using this.
4,All important stroller,"I must say that this is a really good car seat/stroller. We needed it for a long trip from Europe to Oklahoma. It made it sooo much easier. Then when we got to the states it was great for the ride from the airport then the other cars we had to use. As we were waiting for our other car seats when began to love it even more. We were able to go from car to mall, church, movie, store what ever with ease. The only thing we didn't like was that it didn't have an umbrella or something to protect for shade and it isn't suitable for rough areas like gravel or large brick areas. It tends to move funny around those kinds of areas other than that it has been great."
1,Poor hardware quality,THE hinges were of very poor quality .... seat could not be lined up with toilet(causing constant shifting) ..... after only two weeks in use and much slipping .... had to be replaced ... the only thing that got sucessfully flushed involving this seat was my 30 bucks !!
1,Wrong color,"I ordered one of these back in 2008 and liked it so much I decided to reorder it again. The oak color matched the rest of my bath and the seat was comfortable. However, since then I have order it twice now and each time it comes - it arrives in the wrong color.Amazon has taken them back so that is positive. However the color is brown..almost like a very dark walnut. Perhaps the company has changed the color and if so hopefully Amazon can take out the word Oak in the description and also put in a proper picture. I mention this because I ordered it twice and had to send it back twice thinking that maybe they had just packed the wrong item the first time around.Apart from the issue with color, I really liked the product."
1,The seat broke very easily,"The seat is made of four pieces of wood glued together. After only a couple weeks, one of the joins began to split, and within two months, the seat was completely broken.It's very pretty, and priced well, but I can't recommend it."
1,In the Toilet,Do not buy this item ( Ginsey Deluxe toilet Seat ). It is of poor quality in workmanship and material. I purchased two. The seat split on the first one 2 days after installation. When I opened container of second one the lid was cracked in two pieces. Took seat from one and lid from other so as to make one until I could purchase a product of better quality. Again do not buy this item.
1,"NO SUPPORT, CLUMSY INTERFACE","This product (although it lasted a while and never broke) is a clumsy device. Awkward size and bulky with its 40 (or whatever) gig harddisk. Useful in surveillance exercises, fits in your pocket and records video from say a shirt button spy camera with audio nicely. BUT the mp3 interface has no folders options. All mp3's are unsortable in a linear fashion which you cumbersomely have to sift through page by page with no shortcut keys to get to what you want to listen to.. It utterly stinks. Worse than that there is NO NO NO support for this device out of Korea or Taiwan or whatever, and when the rechargeable battery dies... your device is dead. I found this page while searching for a battery and I cannot find one anywhere. It is WAY WAY overpriced. Stay away from it. For mp3's use ipod or something. The SUPPORT is NON existant. Bad Bad product."
3,Decepcionante,"No me ha gustado demasiado. La trama es casi inexistente, y el lenguaje parece poco cuidado, como si lo hubiera escrito de un tirón, sin pararse a repasar lo escrito. Me gustó mucho más ""La nada cotidiana"", que resultaba más fresco y vital."
3,A reader from New York City.,"La novela es previsible, no tiene una trama solida pero a pesar de todo es capaz de atraparte. Pienso que tiene momentos excelentes como el capitulo del Diario-Guion de Cine que mucho recuerda a la pelicula ""Te quiero y te llevo al Cine"".Los personajes son bien cercanos a la realidad, estan vivos. Se lee de un tiron como parece haber estado escrita.De los Cubanos se dice lo que la gente quiere oir. Pero se hace camino al andar, como decia Machado. Puede encontrar mejores cosas si lo que busca es buena literatura, mas si solo pretende leer la va ha pasar bien."
5,A great resource for parents and campers,"As a former camper, counselor and staff member at summer camp, I enjoyed reading this book. As the mother of future campers, I will keep this book handy for me and for the kids. Thank you Chris and Jon for a job well done!"
5,Just in time for summer,"This is a really helpful book for preparing for summer camp. Here's a tip I got from a friend: if you buy it through acabookstore.org (ACA = American Camping Association) then it comes with a DVD-CD set. My son, who's pretty anxious about going to camp, watched the DVD and that really helped turn his anxiety into excitement. The book and DVD give great tips on preparing (packing, etc.) for camp, but also gives great insight on how to approach the camp experience. Together they answered a lot of questions I didn't even know to ask. It's one of those things you can't afford not to get."
4,"Solid, basic and easily portable protection for your rack gear.","The finish and fit of these ""roto-molded"" cases is a bit rough, with lots of minor cosmetic imperfections. For example, the front and rear lids don't mate and seal as nicely as you might want for best moisture and dust protection, but this is the most basic rackmount case you can get; cases like this are generally made to take a beating on the outside (so your rack gear doesn't), and they always end up looking pretty ugly anyway. More importantly, it's a good design that's easily portable and stackable, and SKG warrants the case against any kind of breakage, for life. That's MY kind of warranty. Mine also came with all the hardware needed to mount three ""one-unit"" rack effects. I honestly think these things are a bit overpriced, but all in all, it's a solid value. Buy with confidence."
1,wont let go!,"I have heard all these good things about this holster but I could not get it to let go of my 1911. one out of 3 tries, now I have been useing handguns for the last 40 years and carried/comp/military for 32 yrs. I have used the Safriland SSIII duty holser before and no problem. no go on this thing. I tried a ITAC no problem, on a 1911 and a friends sig 250. So dumped it (got money back) and went ITAC now just gotta get a belt loop back for it... they dont make it so just have to impro..."
1,Does not fit all 1911 clones as stated,"This product does not work with a Taurus 1911 w/rail. I am asked to rate this product but cannot, a no rating is appropriate because the product is unusable for the handgun it was purchased for. The one star is the only way to submit this comment."
5,good hoster,"I bought this for a friend, he said its great and he likes it very much, he is a police officer and uses it for off duty."
3,"The Authors, should have mentioned Stalinist Genocides!","Gentlemen: I have read your book and found it factual to a point. I failed to believe, that the authors did not experience any form of genocide commited by the partisans and Gypsies against Yugoslavias ethnic German population i.e., the ""Donauschwaben"". These people lived in the Banat for more than 250 years, they were not Nazi transplants as some have said, many partisans lived of their farms. The Nazis used them and Communists exterminated them, I feel, they were the victims of both sides.I was born in the Rumanian Banat 14 Kilometers from the Yugoslav border near Cernje in 1933 I saw the carnage from Cernje, Kikinda to Knicanin and more,as a 12 year old I saw Hell on earth. As refugees we had only one horse, therefore, we moved very slow in six inches of mud,I was mostly with the horse as a guide. I have more to say!!!"
3,Not the same as the photo,"I ordered this and got it in about a week, which is good. But I got one with dark colors and not pastels, so I wrote and told them about it and they said they would send me another one, which they did in just a few days, but they sent me the same one they sent in the first place. So either they have the wrong photo up or a crappy camera cuz it doesn't look like the photo."
2,watch for stripped top balls,"I ordered this one, its a great color, but was defective. The company was great on how they handled the return."
3,Enjoyable,"It's always a pleasure to watch John Savage and this movie is no exception. He plays a Hollywood director who's desperate to rekindle his career. So desperate that he would do almost anything, including destroying the only thing he has left: his home. Unfortunately for him, more and more people get wind of his deed and now everybody wants a piece of the action.Unfortunately the DVD does not have a lot of extras. Only two: a picture gallery and the electronic press kit. Although John Savage has not been interviewed for the press kit, it's well worth watching for the comments of the other actors and the director. The picture quality of the DVD was not very good, but I might just have gotten a flawed copy.Burning Down the House is a low budget independent movie and will not be to everybody's taste, but if you like black off-the-wall comedies go for it. ;-)"
5,A better idea,"Here is a new idea on on old product, I own other reciprocating saws and they only do one thing. The movable handle make plunge cuts easy and the adjustable foot gives better control at angles. Just a better idea."
5,Sawzall with benifits !,"Most of the time I use this thing fully extended like any other sawzall , It's rugged, macho and inelegant as the best of them. Don,t worry that this tool has an extra yah-yah tacked on as a novelty selling point that will inevitably fail undermining the whole tool . The handle (stock ? ) simply has a hinge , not connected to the workings of the machine , simple and smart . Mostly its just another sawzall but in those unavoidable awful crap demo moments when you need to cut something kind of flat in a ugly smelly to small space , you find you can fold the handle and this tool will fit in the cavity like nothing else on the job site . This tool is worth a few extra clams ."
5,Milwaukee 'the hatchet',"Excellent tool, great for tight spaces. It's a discontinued product, to my knowledge. A battery unit is being sold. Stick with the corded version: all the battery cutting tools that I've owned had a short battery life... No good !I've ordered my hatchet to do a major overhaul to my house main beams & floors. I did receive my tool on time... But my factory new tool (in a sealed OEM box) was missing the power cord. I called Milwaukee that turned me back to Amazon.com. Amazon was willing to send me a new tool, I was'nt interested: I needed a cord, that's it. I called my local Milwaukee serv. dept. to get the cord, Amazon gave me a credit note on my Visa to pay me back for the cord.Thank you Amazon: you rock !Great tools, fair prices & great service."
2,Get the heavy duty model instead.,"Be aware that this model is only the 7-1/2 Amp saw, not the heavy duty 11 Amp saw. I'm surprised that many are paying more than $110.00 for this light-weight instead of just paying just a few dollars more for the 11 Amp, which will outlast this model, and blaze through your projects without overheating and bogging down."
4,Good tool,"The hatchet is up to milwaukee's usual standards and is of excellent build quality. I see this reciprocating saw as being for someone who only needs it for small to medium jobs. Right now I have been using the saw for a demo project on a commercial building and my only complaint would be that saws gets extremely hot after long uses. Black handle grip gets hot enough to burn hands when used for long periods under heavy hand pressure and therefore gloves are needed. Even with gloves many breaks are needed as the saw even burns my hands while wearing gloves. Because of this heat problem I gave this tool four stars, but otherwise I would definitely recommend this tool to a DIY type person or someone who needs a sawzall occaisionally."
2,"An inconsistent, boring, even terrible book","The first third of this book is a series of confused images that are a struggle to get through. I kept having to re-read sections to find what point I must have missed, since the trail that the author was taking was too obscure. The last third of the book appeared to be sort of another novel tacked on in order to satisfy the publisher's requirement for a book of 300 pages. Some of the middle third are the only parts worth reading, and they are still not that good!There are huge logical inconsistencies throughout the story, and the sudden changes of time and place are so clumsy that they are confusing rather than clever. All the female characters are basically the same person, and are cardboard cutouts of people with no substance.If only the author could stop her literary self-indulgence, she might be capable of writing something of substance, since there is a little potential here. But I can't recommend this book."
2,"incoherent,unfocused and very non linear",I could not believe that I read the same book that received such gushing reviews from almost all reviewers. This book did not know where to go with a potentially fascinating premise. I have read alot of Holocaust literature but find this book the most disappointing of all.
3,Over-rated holocaust novel,I was very disappointed. The book has a few moments of beauty and insight but lacks narrative drive and is frequently pretentious . A willingness to deal with a serious subject like the Holocaust does not in itself qualify a book for greatness. Pales into insignificance besides the work of someone like Primo Levi.
3,great images; poor fiction,"Yes, the writing is jewel-like, but so stunning that it often calls attention to itself rather than to the underlying ideas, thoughts, and characters. The images from the first section are stunning. the final section is simply shallow and bewildering. A suggestion: read the first section. And then use your time instead to read Charles T. Powers' In the Memory of the Forest for a much more fully realized and wonderful novel peeling off the layers of the present to find the hand of the past that still holds the present."
4,Review of Fugitive Pieces by Forrest Pangborn,"Anne Michaels' novel entitled Fugitive Pieces tells an interesting and intriguing story. Although it relates a somewhat typical story of post-Holocaust life for a Jewish child, Michaels captured my attention with her deep imagery and poetic language. The use of the imagery creates many dramatic effects and helps convey a number of different themes and feelings throughout the book. I recommend Fugitive Pieces for anyone with an interest in the Holocaust and a love for poetry."
4,Fugitive Pieces Review- Dena Boone,"The novel, Fugitive Pieces, is an example of outstanding literature that takes a hold of readers and makes an impact on their lives. Anne Michaels uses effective language that takes the reader through specific events of the Holocaust and tells of its effects on the characters throughtout this novel. Fugitive Pieces focuses on three main characters, their families, and their struggles through life, love, memory, and silence. I recommend this novel for individuals who are interested in history as well as Michael's talent for portraying characters in powerful ways."
3,Fugitive Pieces,"Anne Michaels Fugitive Pieces demonstrates her beautiful use of language but also her lack of imagination and creativity to develop a captivating story. Her examples of imagery and metaphors rank high and are among the few points of the novel that kept my attention. The plot was somewhat predictable and contained very little that connected me to the characters which would have caused me to appreciate the plot more. The thoughts of the main characters, Jakob and Ben, jumped constantly from topic to topic and didn't focus on any particular subject at one time. The themes brought out by Michaels are notable, as are the ways she illustrates them. However, the book is very difficult to follow and very ambiguous at times. Even though the use of language is excellent, the ambiguity and confusing jumps found throughtout the entirety of the novel overwhelm the language. I would recommend Fugitive Pieces only to those who find language more interesting than plot and interpret meaning easily."
2,Fugtive Pieces,"Ms Michaels writes like a woman wearing all her jewelry at once. Why not sprinkle those literary jewels with more care. She hits the reader over the head with all the lines she has saved up over the years for her poetry. We know she understands the subtly of metaphor....but she isn't sure her reader does. I will go to her poetry and hope for more, which will hopefully be less."
1,"Is ""Fugitive Pieces"" really worth the reading?","""Fugitive Pieces"" was a book that I thought was not worth my time because it was a really hard book to read, understand and some of the imagery used was hard to figure out. I think that other people like this book just because it it hard to read, so they think it must be good. This book tries to correlate two readers to be the same, but it just makes the story more confusing. The beggining of this book was really intruiging and touching when Jakob was narrating about how he found a new ""family"" and ""fatherly figure"",Athos who made gave him a new life to start over from his terrible past. But when the other narrator,Ben, started narrating, it confused me and made me think how worthless this book really is. It seems to me like Ann Micheals took a stroy and tried to add meaning and value to were their is none. So, overall this book is not worth your time."
1,Terrible,"In the past week since I finished the book, I find myself every so often experience a small wave of genuine relief that I am no longer reading it. There is little to no plot development, although the story begins with a good start and beckons the reader to keep reading it in the hope that it will develop. It doesn't. The characters remain the same monotonous bores throughout, basking in ad nauseum ""poetic"" descriptions of the gray details of their lives. I could accept a book that is built on poetry rather than plot if the poetry itself was insightful or beautiful or even a cohesive collection. There were a couple of lines that resonated with me and that I will continue to think about. But they were buried within pages and pages of incoherent drivel. A entire book of this stuff was just not warranted."
4,You have to understand what the author is trying to convey.,"Fugitive Pieces is neither a novel nor a book of poetry. It is another form of expression which shares elements of both.With novels, the plot of the story is usually central to the understanding of the themes- not so with Fugitive Pieces; the events in the lives of the main characters are only secondary to their thoughts and feelings about their pasts. Because the plot is a less important element to the book, the author expresses her message in the thoughts of the main characters.To try to read this work as if it were a traditional novel is pointless. It might be boring to some but only because it is entirely different from most books. There is a profundity in this book that must be sought in the metaphors and short stories rather than a main plot. Only after these are understood, do the lives of the actions of the protagonists make sense."
4,Beautiful. . . Nearly Great,"I found this book to be immediately engrossing. Unlike many of the reviewers, I did not find it necessary to let the book ""grow on me"". If anything, it seemed to me that the integrity of the book deteriorated towards the end, when it became somewhat over-wrought and plot driven (not necessarily a bad thing, but secondary to the effectiveness of this book). Nevertheless, overall I would say that this is a lyrical, evocative read. I look forward to reading some of Michael's much-acclaimed poetry, because I think her style would translate more naturally into that literery form."
5,Simply Beautiful,"I found this book to be quite simply, beautiful. I passed this book on to friends who enjoy reading and all have concurred. What a treasure it was to find something well written with signifigance and style. I would like to thank the author for the enjoyment given."
1,Sooo boring ....,"I was so excited about this book, but was greatly disappointed. Don't waste your time and money on this one. It has to be THE most boring book I've read in ages. And very difficult to read too. Unless if you're truly into poetry and poets, don't bother with this one. A huge disappointment. I want my money back!"
5,5 stars for the poetic writing alone!,"Forget the story of this book (it is great)....the sheer magic of the writing is great! There are so many of those great ""one liners"" that just hit you and you know you will always remember."
3,Bits are genius.,"I know what I loved about this book, but unfortunately I have never been a fan of poetry and could tell this work was written by a poet. The first quarter of the book (I believe it was a first addition from the library) had two serious type setting/lay out errors that I'm sure made Anne Michaels cringe. Content wise, I thought there were too many lovers, I lost track of the main characters women. I loved the haunting visuals and theory of Holocaust heros. But what brought me the most joy was the segments about the Scott expedition and the Inuit who found his fathers remains in a museum, both topics I have a passion for and was so shocked and thrilled to see them mentioned. No regrets in reading and I do look forward to reading more from Ms. Michaels."
2,Mediocre,"I wanted to enjoy this book for the description sounded so enticing. Parts of it were beautiful and enjoyable to read, but most was too poetic and choppy to follow. Would imagine that many would enjoy it if the style was were appealing to them. Not for everyone. I never understood the introduction of Naomi and partner."
3,IT IS JUST LIKE READING POETRY,"I've just begun reading it, but it's clear from the opening that the writer is a poet - calling the reader to follow visually and emotionally the experience by means of lots of similes which are rich and strange. The imagery is powerful, the language precise."
2,"Beautiful prose, lousy novel","Fugitive Pieces is filled with stunningly written prose that makes you stop and ponder. Although I appreciate the prose, the book lacks any type of plot, and the characters are so distant that I never grew to care about any of them."
4,Emotionally draining,"I've read many pieces dealing with Jewish persecution and the Holocaust (I'm not Jewish) which moved me, but this one reached me at a deeper level. It is, at once, compelling and emotionally draining ... AND it's a poignant story. Thanks to my book club for selecting it!"
4,An elegant book about the post-Holocaust era? Yup.,"Winner of 6 Canadian literary awards, author Anne Michaels constructs the story, set in post-Holocaust Poland, of a 7yo boy's journey to healing and redemption via the age-old power of love - but not conventional love, this time. No, it's love for an old man and for ancient botanical history.The story begins during the war when Jakob, the protagonist who has recently seen his family murdered by Nazis, is discovered by a Greek geologist who spirits him off to Greece and hides him till the end of the war. There Athos, the Greek, helps Jakob recover from his psychic wounds by teaching him about the flora and fauna of ancient eras.A stunningly beautiful story that leaves a powerful afterglow."
2,Just Couldn't Get Into It,"Sorry Ms. Michaels, I just could not get into this story. I liked the first 35% of the book, and then it deteriorated (in my estimation) substantially, when the chief character moved to Toronto.What I identified as the problem for me was that I felt the book was frequently ""over-written."" Too cute for its own good, too often, and then the sentence-fragment-add-ons were a kind of show-off, an author saying, ""See how clever I am?""The author is a poet, and this book too often reads like a bad marriage between prose and poetry.I'm sure others loved the book. Just not for me.A 2 on Amazon's scale."
5,One of the best books I ever read,"The book is simply fantastic. Like most wonderful reads, I shared it with other people and have done so for years. Amazingly, each person has felt the very same way and has then passed it on to someone else. I have yet to speak to anyone who thought it was a failed attempt at anything."
1,Offensively cutesy,"C'mon people. It's time to expect a little more from the books we read than what's offered in this trite, limp, detestable piece of holocaust exploitation. Anne Michaels should be ashamed of herself. After finishing the book, I promptly threw it out. I urge the publisher and all booksellers to do the same. My only comfort lies in how soon Fugitive Pieces will be forgotten."
1,I couldn't finish it,"While this book may be well written and in general I enjoy historical fiction, I could not stomache this for some reason. There are so many true stories of the Nazi's atrocities that need to be told and read. For me, the real stories are so powerful that any attempt to fictionalize what happened to the Jewish people and others almost seems wrong."
2,Fugitive Pieces,"This book could have been reduced to about a quarter of it's size, the author has tried to include every word in the English language in the story. The story itself would have been a good read without the paragraph upon paragraph of tortured meaningless sentences that added nothing to the story. Would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Like an overstuffed chair,"I tried at least six times to pick up the rhythm and flow of this book but always felt like i was being preached to rather than joining in an imaginative recreation. lacks the quality of felt life, is overwritten, extremely abstract, and hardly a novel at all. Some memorably evocative descriptive prose but too fragmented and, despite its horrific subject, curiously detached."
4,Better line- by- line than in overall construction,"This is truly a poet's book, and perhaps it is most moving in its line- by- line perceptions. What it seems to me to lack is a sustaining picture of situation and character which moves us to greater interest and knowledge as we read. I had the sense that once I understood the basic relationship between Jacob Beer and his Greek rescuer that there was no overall development.I can be wrong.And I believe most readers would say I am.This is one review I would not bet on myself on."
4,"Time, Language, and Memories","Through a captivating style, Anne Michales writes of the joys and sorrows of time, language and memories in a man's life. Her way with words such as ""Time is a blind guide"" evokes one's every thoughts and emotions to look deeper into the meaning. Jacob Beer, the protagonist, lived in the Holocaust era, and through the book, the reader enjoys watching him grow through time, language and memories. The tragedy's of a childhood will stick with Jacob Beer as he learns a whole new way of life.I enjoyed this book because of the writing style Anne Michaels holds. It was that of which would intrigue one's thoughts even after the book was put aside."
2,Another cry against hyper-lyricism,"This book seems already to have been amply reviewed on Amazon.com and so I will be brief: I fully concur with those reviewers who found the lyricism excessive, the poet virtually bullying the novelist right off the page. The concept was strong - the successive and only partially interlaced lives of a holocaust survivor and his protege. But Ms. Michaels seems always to have to remind us of her poetic gifts, page by increasingly tedious page. I began to feel the way one does having to watch a parlour performance by a child whose parents have told her too often how talented she is. If you want a book by another Canadian Anne who can match Michael's lyricism stride for stride but also spin a captivating tale of how history insinuates ordinary lives, go instead to Anne Marie MacDonald's ""Fall on Your Knees""."
3,One-half success; one-half failure,"This book is a wonderful success and, at the same time, an utter failure. The author has a rare gift for using words to paint a feeling, a mood, an atmosphere. However, reading this book makes it painfully apparent that a story requires more than just a gift for language. To construct a story that works, a writer must be able to paint with actions as well as words. Actions move the plot forward; the choice of action reveals character, bit by bit. This book has beautiful language, and no action, and therefore, no story. It is a book-length poetic meditation. If that's what you're looking for, you can probably not find a lovelier one. If you are looking for a story, a novel, a drama, characters -- this book simply doesn't have them."
5,Good basic information for the dancer or teacher,"This book covers, in a brief way, some of the orthopedic problems encountered by dancers in their training. It gives basic advice on developing a conditioning program for dancers. These topics are covered in greater depth in other resources (for example, Dance Technique and Injury Prevention by Justin Howse; and Dance Kinesiology by Sally Fitt). The most valuable sections come towards the end of the book. It covers basic things that athletic trainers know, but may not be known to the dancer or dance instructor. For example, treatment protocols for common injuries. It goes into taping techniques for many situations. This is particularly valuable."
3,Certainly less than meets the eye,"Parsons makes a few useful observations. The pattern variables are somewhat useful for talking about modern versus traditional politics. However, much of this book seems old and outdated."
5,Sanctity of personal space,"The art of relationships begins with respect, which begins with respecting oneself, according to this book. It gives a great deal of wisdom on the best way to conduct oneself in the art of relationship building.The authors cover the relationships to oneself, to God, to others, to children and even to the earth. All of this information comes in the framework of Jewish theology, of course, but insofar as it is based on the Tenach, there is no reason that the book cannot be insightful and helpful for Christian readers as well.There is even solid advice of how to heal when it is no longer possible to talk with another person--for whatever reason, including death.This is a marvelous book that I recommend to one and all, Jewish or non-Jewish.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
2,Not much content,"The history of warfare: the Zulu Wars is a documentary type presentation of the events in South Africa in 1879 when the British invaded and conquered Zululand, mostly because they wanted their land. The invasion and the ensuing battles are described in the video though it is a mix of a small amount of original content with a couple of actors and then clips from the two movies Zulu! and Zulu Dawn. While the movies are very good recreations of the events (with some Hollywood thrown in, of course) it seemed pretty lame to me to simply include movie footage as historical content. Not a bad video but nothing really new."
5,Delicious,"If you've never read this book, don't wait! Is slowly becomes creepier and creepier and...SPOILERThe bad guys win!"
2,A disappointment,"This book came to me highly recommended, but I had to force myself to finish it. I know that many people consider this book a classic, but the writing style was simply too distracting for me to get into the story and enjoy myself. No one can seem to speak normally. They gasp, whisper, purr, rasp, drone, etc. It was very distracting. I don't feel that this book has stood the test of time. It may have been something special back when it was first printed, but it has not aged well. The premise behind the book was interesting, but the writing style was just too old fashioned and borderline silly for my tastes. Despite all the other rave reviews of this book, I felt very let down and disappointed."
5,And better than you could hope...,"It is great to have this pulp classic (first published in the pages of ""Unknown"" in the early forties and expanded in 1947) back in print. This is the best in ""epic horror""; every chapter has a new suprise, a new shock, a new monster -- but Williamson keeps it all together in his focus on a tortured and confused protagonist, caught between his friends and his confusing ""lust"". Although supposedly a werewolf novel, the author expands the story into a titanic struggle of humanity and the dark unknown, a struggle that lasts through all time and infects all of us. Impossible to put down, and worth it for the surprising emotional climax that reverses all conventions of horror (at least as horror was known then). Get it now!"
3,"Good, albeit flawed, novel...","The book, The Mammoth Book of Wolf Men, led me to this novel. There just aren't that many great werewolf novels out there (as the introduction attests) and this is one of the better examples. It is a good book, but I don't know if I would really describe it as a ""werewolf novel."" It is certainly a variation on the theme. People do turn into wolves in this story, but they turn into any animal they choose. Also, it is not so much a transformation as simply choosing an animal avatar that becomes real while the ""actual"" person sleeps. It is more a book about witchcraft with a pseudo-scientific explanation.I did have a few problems with the text. The writing feels a bit dated. You just know that the ""good guys"" are going to do the wrong thing at every turn because the plot calls for it. Mainly though - it has a weak protagonist. Will Barbee doesn't seem to have any will of his own and is simply the pawn in other people's schemes."
5,timeless piece enjoyable for any ears,"This song is so good it sounds good in any remix. Nothing beats it. It combines so many aspects to it, beautiful rythym just awesome. I could listen to this all day! Buy it or the safri duo remixes episode 2 and you won't regret it. Whether you like trance or not, if you love beautiful music this is for you!"
2,One of the worst I've read this year,"Eliots tale of the Raveloe weaver was not only boring with a shaky and divided storyline, but held a trite view of the materialistic loner Silas and his previous life. He who was entraped in his own world of pain and anguish with only his gold to comfort him, reawakened from the appearence of a young girl, Eppie. Eliot's potrayal of Silas's metamorphosis, however, held little real meaning for me. With the exception of a few kicks at the upper class, the book didn't accomplish much (especially in the way of entertainment)."
4,Diffrent than what I expected,"I just recently ordered Lambert Wilson's CD ""Loin"" and absolutely LOVED it, so this one was next on my list. At first I was disapointed because ""Demons & Merveilles"" is nothing like the other album, but after listening to it for the second time it grew on me. This is an album of old French movie songs, some of them are beautiful classics, and all of them are nicely performed. If you like the old 30's and 40's movies it is worth getting and the vocals are beautiful, very intimate at times and in period. Lambert Wilson can do no wrong for me, so I really got to like this album a lot. But if you expect another upbeat ""Loin"" to listen to while driving, this might not be your best choice..."
4,A better book if it's printed instead of doodling text.,"The first inline skating book I come across deals with real life situation. I just moved to Atlanta from priers. I was used to plat park. Here in Atlanta, I haven't found a place where are no steep hills. Being inexperienced to slope, I took a hard fall. It put me out of action for a month. The section about down hill is lifesaver for me.It's a good book.But, I hate the presentation of the book. It's so damn hard to read. Have you ever attempted to figure out the description that your doctor gave to you? Image a whole book of those scribbles. My brain hurts when I read this damn book. Plus pages after pages autonomy incorrect cartoon figures to show the fancy moves. I believe I'll fall harder if I try to learn a power slide stop from this book.If the book was typed and with photo pictures of real skater, it would be an excellent 5 out of 5 book. Now I give it 3 out of 5 because of its shabby production."
4,A good investment for a beginner,"This book can't be read and understood at one sitting. If you do try to read at one sitting as beginner or low intermediate skater you will certainly miss many subtle points.I have read this book about 4 times, nearly cover-to-cover as I needed to be reminded of different points or I didn't fully read the points indicated. Of course if I were a good skater I wouldn't be doing this. There are moves I still don't understand but that's ok as I am a long way from that level at the momentThe lack of photos instead of diagrams was disappointing, but now I think diagrams are better as, there are so many and the labeling is extensive.This book wont makes you a great skater. You need an instructor for that, but as a guide it is excellent.I would have preferred a more-structured layout in terms of points to remember and perhaps a greater depth of explanation of subtle points. Having said that I doubt you will go wrong buying this book given the audience it targets."
5,Excellent,"An excellent publication. Diagrams are well thought out, giving all the steps required to complete a move along a timeline. The writing style and use of humour in the text and illustrations makes reading and learning fun, and the author really captures the inner thoughts of a beginning skater as he prepares to execute a move, making the reader feel comfortable with trying them. I keep the book with me and review a page or two now before I skate to hone my skills. Thanks for an excellent publication!"
2,Inline Skating Review,"William Nealy's book is a tough read because he's chosen to present basic instruction with hard-to-sort-out and confusing drawings, hand-sketched caricatures of actual skaters. While his overall comments on basic inline skill sets may be helpful, the myriad cartoon drawings aren't, often times appearing indecipherable. Of course an intermediate-level reader most likely will recognize what's going on, but for a beginner seeking underlying fundamentals--good luck!"
2,It's sloppy! (I can't get past that.),"This book is packed with valuable information that is pretty well organized. Also, it has a great system of diagramming techniques: for example, showing weight distribution between skates using shaded in triangles. I haven't seen this in any other book and is quite effective means of showing the concepts.But - the text is hand written sloppily (why?)and the diagrams are very sloppily drawn (again, why?). It have to really slow down and focus to read the hand writing (capital N in the middle of a word? I doN't uNderstand!) The diagrams are abundant and contain a lot of detail, but are so filled with unnecessary details, it's hard to draw out the information being displayed.I keep thinking that I'd be glad to help this team rewrite the book - first, using a computer to get the text in and then inserting the SIMPLIFIED drawings. Simple? What could have been a valuable resource to either read a lesson at a time or to research for an technical answer..."
2,Contains Unnecessarily Vulgar Language,"The book uses plenty of detailed sketches to provide all of the techniques you'll need to know, and then some. The content of the book is more than sufficient to enable someone to become a proficient inline skater, and is easily understandable. Unfortunately, the book is equally thorough in its use of profanity, making it unsuitable for my kids to see. A book about skating that is too profane for kids to see? Give me a break . . ."
2,Cheaply made,I ended up returning this. The power cord kept falling out of its socket in the back of the radio.
4,Rock me,"A friend turned me on to these guys a while ago and I've had the pleasure of seeing them live a couple of times in Chicago. The New CD is very cool. They do a good job of mixing several different electronic styles (dub, jungle, trip hop, house) into one unique style. TRS-80 puts on a great live show and they've put out a good 'ol CD as well. No buyer's remorse with this CD!"
3,Not his best,"In my opinion, this book is not at all up to the standard of Williams' other novels. There are some interesting characters and ideas but a lot of inconsistencies and rough edges as well. Read it if you have read the other novels and want this one for completeness. The one memorable character for me was Isabel, and her most memorable quote,""But those that die may be lordlier than you; they are obedient to defeat. Can you live truly till you have been quite defeated? You talk of living by your hurts, but perhaps you avoid the utter hurt that's destruction."""
1,"unclear about what ""edited"" means here","I have the same question -- still unanswered -- about this ""edition"" as about the ""edition"" of Williams's _All Hallows Eve_ This ""Shadows"" is substantially shorter than my hardcopy of _Shadows of Ecstasy_ If ""edited"" here really means abridged, I would like to know. The older Williams e books were full of typos, but I'd rather have that than the product of some jerk who thinks he knows more about prose and fiction than Charles Williams does.I really would like an answer to this question."
3,Ten Tenors are entertaining ten fold,"This CD doesn't do justice to the entertaining live shows these Aussie crooners put on. The Ten Tenors are about showmanship as they are about a singing ensemble, yet there's no denying the powerful vocal presence on 'One Is Not Enough'. Generally classified as adult-contemporary, the tenors are accompanied by a lush backing orchestra and grandiose production. Each possess gifted voices, and as a unit straddle one-part opera tenors, one-part church choir, and one-part lounge/theater act. Individually much in the same vein as Tom Jones, Neil Diamond, or Barry Manilow, singers who combine power with an impressive vocal range. Collectively the vocals are inspirational and enlightening, and combined with Andrew Lloyd Webber type arrangements, it makes this recording that much more divine. Easy listening as it is joyous if you like choruses raised in song."
1,Inu Yasha,Hey all! I reccomend you all to buy this dvd for 10 reasons and I list them below!1. The episodes on cartoon network were awesome!2. The fight is great3. you get to she shippous dead father!(mhawhaha)4. No corney editing5. You get to see the tetsugia in action6. repeat all the reasons above and if you don't agree with me that this dvd will be great ten you should jump off a clif
1,too much,"I bought this for my grandaughter. I paid $129 for it, so disapointed. It didnt even come with a doll. so now I have to spend more miney for that. For $129. you would think it would have been a little bigger then a 12 by 12 box, I mean inches, never again!!!!!!!"
4,"Easy buy, easy install",The package arrived the second day after I ordered it.This drive came with everything that was needed. I did have to open the manual---big deal. I'm running it on WinXP SP2 and it works fine. It's a necessary evil because new PCs don't come with floppy drives.
3,FRUSTRATION!!,"After many hours of trying to get this to work, I finally got it to work. The drivers are not compatible with windows XP, service pack 2. Since I'm not a computer genius I had no idea what to do. Finally after reading how to unzip a file I finally got the thing to work. Their website tells you that you need winzip for $29. You really don't. Just unzip the file and you are set. I really like the product, but installing it was a real battle for me."
4,Great Gadget,"I needed this multi external drive to read and write designs for an embroidery machine, as my new laptop does not have a flopy drive nor a drive for a compact flash card. And the Iomega Floppy Plus 7-in-1 Card Reader seemed the best and least expensive solution.I have not used it much just made sure it worked for what I wanted, that would read and write the designs I needed. So far everything seems to work ok."
5,Mirror and magnetic pick up tools.,"Have used the mirror a couple of times to view the fittings at the rear of my truck engine. I have not used the magnetic tool, as of yet, but it has a strong magnet."
2,It wasn't that great.,"I used this part sparingly and in terms of time it lasted for quite a while, but to my surprise one day I had to play around with it to make it work and I noticed that there was a tear in the cable. I threw it away right after and not too long after that I got a new car with an Auxiliary port. One should only buy this if you're desperate for a cable and don't like any other of the selections because after a while if you fiddle around with it by pulling it in and out every time you want to connect your iPod you may end up tearing it."
1,This item doesnt work,This item is incompatible with my ipod nano. Its waste of money..... I will be returning this item and looking forward for the refund..
1,Ipod Nano 5Gen - THIS DOES NOT WORK,It is not explicit in the advert what Ipods this does NOT work with. I thought all chargers fitted all Ipods. Now i have brought this item for an iPod that does not support this charger - Arggghhh
1,Caution!,"The charger worked fine for a week, then when plugging it in one morning it fried my IPOD. I was using the Itrip and plugged it in, then nothing. Apple said it was completely dead and i had to get a new one. I'm not sure if it was a faulty socket in the car or a faulty charger but i'm sticking to the mains charger from now on!"
1,Freezes up!,"Worked great at first, but now it freezes my ipod up just about everytime I try to use it. Once it freezes I can't get it to work again. I have to wait until the battery completely dies out and charge it back up at home."
3,Belkin power cord,I bought Belkin FM transmitter to hook it into my portable DVD player. Use the Belkin power cord to power FM transmitter instead of using conventional battery.Power cord should be supplied with a filter to avoid a nuisance humming interference noise from car generator.
1,Worthless Time Wasting Product,"If You are thinking of buying a Belkin Product DON'T. There products are hard to find, and you will get conflicting information from their vendors. This is what happened to me. I was told to order this product by a salesperson at Circuit City. I went to Bestbuy, Radio Shack and then Circuit City to find it. None of these stores had the product available. I was told at Circuit City that this product would solve my problem by allowing me to charge my Belkin wireless FM Receiver which I purchased for Christmas for my Daughter from Costco. The product didn't solve the problem. I still have to buy batteries for the Belkin Wireless FM Receiver. Which by the way uses quite a lot of them. After all the time I spent trying to fix this Belkin Product I purchased a Sony Product online that was cheaper, easier to get and did the job better than any Belkin Product."
2,Liked it until it broke,"It worked well for about two years (of very light use) and then the connector just crumbled into pieces. For an item that typically sells for $20, this isn't the sort of quality one should expect. I would look elsewhere."
3,Ok if you can bear the hissing sound.,"The ipod can play songs and simultaneously get charged by this charger. As long as you can bear the low background static, playback is just fine. It's not really noticeable until your car comes to a stop though. One other feature I'd have expected to see is the ability to automatically put the ipod in standby mode when I turn off the engine when the ipod is charging."
5,Love this item,I got this item after reading some of the other reviews while searching for the perfect ipod charger for my car. Belkin definitely makes some of the best products for ipods and would definitely recommend this item for anyone. Its a tad more expensive than other chargers but far worth it.
1,Killed my iPod - twice!,"The unit worked very well for a while, but, one day, I plugged it in and the iPod just went dead. It did not register in the computer, and would not play any music. I returned the iPod to the Apple store, and they gave me a new one. But, a few months later, the exact same thing happened again! This time, however, I'm beyond the 1-year warranty, and do not think Apple will help me out again.Beware of this product! Don't trust your expensive music player to a cheap power cord - buy a different brand and save yourself a headache."
3,"It works, but...","I have a 3G iPod and I have not lockup problems like other users said they had.However, it does introduce some hiss sound to your music. It bothered me at first but then I just forgot about it and enjoyed my endless music traveling time. Some said this can be fixed by adding some kind of ""filter"" to the AC connector in your car.I would say, it's a decent charger with a decent price tag.Hope it helps."
1,Doesn't work,"It won't work in my vehicle. I've tried it in both the lighter plug and the alternate power source. I tried it on my wife's vehicle also, but it didn't work there either. The light comes on, but nothing happens when I plug it into my iPod. At first, I thought it was because I had just unplugged the iPod from the dock so it was fully charged, so I played it for a while so the battery would drain a little. The bar went down noticably, yet nothing happened when I tried to charge it up using this cord. I have the model F8V7067-APL."
5,Does it's Job,The Mobile Power Cord is useful if you are going on a long trip. Not many of us go on trips longer then a few hours though so just remember that the iPod does have a 15 hour battery life (yeah right) so unless you are driving to Canada you won't need this accessory.
1,killed my ipod,"I was using this power cord in conjunction w/ the belkin fm transmitter during a recent 4 hour car ride. when I unplugged the ipod, it was incredibly hot, and now it does not work (I get the folder w/ the exclamation point on the display). I tried to restore the ipod, but it is toast."
1,Never arrived,"It's been a year since I ordered it, and I found out that this book has never arrived."
2,Not Moore's Usual Quality,"I really enjoyed 'From Hell' and thought that the first volume of 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' was brilliant.'V for Vendetta', however, posesses little of that quality. I found it to be very two-dimentional and introspective. It reaches for an epic scale, but comes across like an adolescent in-joke. This graphic novel might play better to youths than Moore's other works- but clearly NOT to adults."
5,Worth your trip to the movie threater....,"Having just seen (yesterday)the film and read the original graphic novel in 1987. I would give a thumbs up to the film, although the Wachowski Brothers have stay mostly faithful to the book with a few exceptions ie Evey's occupation, Finch's relationship to V and the ending. I can see Moore's objections to the changes, however these changes in no way lessens the tone & feel of the book. Go read the graphic novel & watch the film. It really does not matter which order you do first. Enjoy the book & film - I did."
2,Not that great,"Maybe it's because of the failed aspect of some predictions (survival in a nuclear war), the ""gee whiz"" quotiant of the science (little of it makes sense), the troubling endorsement of anarchy (what? that'll make everything better?), or the tired cliches (the dirty old priest, the narcissistic announcer, the power-hungry vamp, etc.), but this story doesn't have a lot going for it. Sure, it delves into the ruthless terrorist against the oppresive regime motif, but he presses his POV with a hammer, and it leaves you wishing for more subtlety."
3,V for Vendetta,"I bought this because I thought it was a novel. I didn't realize that it was a graphic novel. It's ok, but I don't really like graphic novels."
1,This is a cartoon book,"I thought this was the book that the movie was based on - sadly, it's a cartoon book and a mask."
4,Exactly as expected.,"I was a fan of the movie and was very curious of the comic after hearing teases about it. I have not had a chance to read it due to a busy schedule, but in glancing through it looks as though it will be just as exciting."
4,"Great in it's day, still good now.","Yeah yeah, it's a landmark publication... blah blahI got a bit bored to be honest, just didn't care about the characters all that much. It makes you think, but it's somewhat dated. Every serious comic afficionado should try to read this at some stage, but only people over 30s (or very well read modern history students) are likely to get the whole picture."
4,"I liked it, but didn't love it","V for Vendetta is a book that has a lot of impact when you first read it, but it wasn't the most entertaining thing I've ever read. I think it does a lot of things better than the movie, although it does have its shortcomings too. However, I would still recommend reading it."
4,Enjoyable Anarchy,"I felt that this was a masterfull piece of writting that created one of the most original characters ever in V himself. It was not a Love story, it is a story about revolution and how once Big Brother is allowed to much control, the only way back to peace is Anarchy.Awsome read. Really Enjoyed it."
2,Stick to the Movie,"Unfortunately, the artwork in this is really poor. It may just be this printing, but the colors look really bad, and it's pretty difficult to even tell what is going on a lot of the time or which characters are saying what during conversations. I also didn't find the narrative to be particularly interesting. Go buy Locke and Key Instead."
4,V is for Verbose,"I could give a damn about art, I read graphic novels for story, and stick-figures would still get the plot across.That said, V is For Verbose.Alan Moore is a genius when it comes to ideas, but he could really use an editor, or even a buddy at the bar proofreading his work and pruning out the endless pages and pages of text that don't seem - to me - to contribute to the story.I don't want the story hacked, as Hollywood keeps doing with his books, I just want to avoid thousands of words of seemingly extraneous dialogue in poorly typeset fonts."
5,Timely once more,"I found this, on my second read, more timely than the first. A Nazi dictatorship in England where the goverment denies citizens liberties and claims national emergency as their excuse. A land where the press is controlled by a group intent only on preserving the status quo. How could it be more timely. After all, the biggest lie in America today is the ""liberal press.""I only hope they do justice to the movie due out sometime soon.""Death to all tyrants"" and Cokeheads in office"
4,Brilliant,"V FOR VENDETTA is completley worth your wile. It will keep you entertaned to the end.V FOR VENDETTA is a powerful story about loss of freedom and individuality, the story takes place in England following a bazar war that changed the face of the planet. In a world with no freedom or precious little faith in anything comes a mysterious man in a mask who fights political oppressors through terrorism and seemingly absurd acts. this is a gripping tale of the blurred lines between good and evil.I relley liked this stoy but felt that there where som"
2,Trade Paperback was Disappointing,"I'm writing this review for the actual product and not the story. I was very disappointed. To start this was like reading an old newspaper comic that had been heavily exposed to sunlight. The colors were faint and it made it hard to distinguish faces and follow the intricate story-line. I was very excited about reading this but the presentation just made it difficult. I've seen digital versions of this graphic novel and they look way better, as expected with a digital copy. I may try a different format but I was disappointed with the quality of the paperback edition. This is a highly rated novel but I'll have to try it on a different format. I'm selling this one back to Amazon."
3,It's okay...,"I read this after seeing the movie so generally I like the first versions of something, songs, movies, etc, and this was the case with V. I really liked the movie but the graphic novel kept losing me. I had trouble keeping up with the supporting characters. I don't really know if it was the writing that lost me as they just showed up from out of nowhere or the art when I couldn't really distinguish one from another at times. Whatever the case, I got lost several times."
4,"It's not a comic, it's an art form.","That somebody could write a tale like this as a graphic novel is ineffect a bewildering achievement. George Orwell, 1984 and all that. Well, the old man would have been proud of an accomplishment like this himself. Alan Moore's obvious talent, if it was ever in doubt that is, shines through in this awesome piece of work."
4,Significantly Different From the Movie,"This is the original graphic novel that the movie was made from - and the movie took some interesting liberties. I love the movie so I had to get the book.While scenes in the book are quite different from the movie - especially he Houses of Parliament and the Old Bailey - it's an absorbing read with very good graphics and an excellent story line.As soon as I finished it, my son grabbed it and I may not see it again unless I threaten him with a baseball bat!!"
3,Mediocre writing,"I have been copiously lectured on the importance of Alan Moore and the moving-and-shaking he did towards revamping the legitimacy of comic books. Consider my opinion here limited because I have only read Vendetta -- I don't think he's that terrific of a writer. He's not bad, but the appellation of ""best writer in the comic book industry Ever"" just doesn't ring terribly true with me. I enjoyed Vendetta, but to be honest I enjoyed the movie more, and his out-spoken bitching about the movies they make of his books (and yes, some have been doozies of movies) speaks more to me of an unearned arrogance and a peevish over-defensiveness of his frankly mediocre writing. Now I need to go and make cookies for the inevitable slew of fan-boys showing up at my door to lynch me."
5,V for vendetta,"An important piece of literature, even if its technically a comic book. The story of a lone Anarchist bent on bringing a Fascist government to its knees with great success. V is a hero to be idolized. Though we boast that we Americans live in a free country.... V shows us that the only true freedom is in anarchy, not chaos, or rulership, and that we must take control of our own lives and not give such a treasure to others for control."
4,Alan Moore is a comic writing master!,"I will give this book 4 stars because I found the story to bog down at the middle of the book. However, it was still a good book and one I would recomend if you read graphic novels."
4,A for Awesome!,"What can I say about Alan Moore, that hasn't already been said...? He is a MAD GENIUS! The universe in his mind is an extraordinary place and we are lucky that he shares a small piece of that place with us. Happy Reading!"
5,Better Than the Movie...,"I really enjoyed reading this novel and found the artwork exceptional. The movie was good but seeing the original concepts added a great deal to the experience.John McClennyWolfbitchBarely Bound: Tales of HorrorGod's Blood, God Seed (Full Circle)Dubious Companions - The Road to RueinA Witch's Dozen"
2,Overrated,"Now, don't get me wrong-I loved Watchmen. But, for some reason, I couldn't get through V for Vendetta. It took me somewhere around three tries to get through it without getting bored and giving up. I don't know why, but I don't think this anywhere near up to par with what Alan Moore can do."
3,"unacceptable paper quality, very nice story","The comic is not exactly as the movie, so even if you have seen the movie, it is nice to read it. The quality of the paper made it almost impossible to read, as well as the coloring of the images. I liked the story. I would not buy it again at this paper quality, but I would buy it at a good one."
5,Just adding an extra 5*,"All the great things about this comics have already been said in previous reviews, I just wanted to add another 5 star to this amazing comic."
3,Not what I expected,"Perhaps I just grew up in a different age, but Alan Moore's work does not resonate with me. Perhaps it is because I have seen the fruits of the tree he and others planted in the comic garden, but some of the concepts seem a little silly for the serious issues of the work. It is still an interesting story and belongs in any graphic novel library but it may not age as well as other of Moore's work."
2,V is for very long,"V if for Vengeance is a weighty tome--not intellectual-ly. It was over 400 pages long. Now I know why people buy e-readers. First, why spell Philip with two lls; its root is philo-which means love of. Second, the author writes from two points of view--first person (when she's Kinsey) and omniscient author when she's writing from Nora's, or Dante's point of view . Maybe Grafton ought to hang up the alphabet mysteries. Oh, and what's with the Japanese gardener, the coyotes, and the huge turkey vultures? This section doesn't advance the story at all."
1,Not what it appeared to be,I bought this product for my son's english class and was greatly disappointed when I received it and it was not the full graphic novel. It was only a small booklet with a chapter. I had to turn around and quickly buy another so my son would have the book for class. Very Disappointing! Be sure you know what you are buying when you purchase from this seller!
2,great concept.....poorly executed,"The idea of a masked terrorist fighting back against a totalitarian government is a interesting story, but the characters in THIS story are weak at best! Some of the dialogue is hokey and the artwork is muddled. You want to read a pager turner that you just can't put down?? Try the Watchmen."
3,Not As Good As the Movie,"Despite the author's bellyaching, the film version of this book is a vast improvement. The movie gets rid of extraneous characters, improves the dialogue, deletes the anti-climactic ending, makes sensible changes regarding plot and characterization, and generally polishes up what is essentially a fairly amateurish ""graphic novel."" The seeds of a good story are there, but a good *editor* was clearly nowhere to be found. Additionally, the book's artwork is murky, dark, and the inking isn't crisp. Go see the movie instead."
5,good read,"this was a good read. it can be a little hard to follow at times, so i would advise watching the movie beforehand. this makes it a little easier to read."
5,Great Book!,"I enjoyed the movie very much...especially since I hadn't seen or read anything about it. It was amazing.The book is excellent. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the movie. One must keep in mind the dated-ness of the book (it takes place in a dystopian UK circa 1997), but it is an enjoyable read."
3,"Great Mask, Disappointing Graphic Novel","The mask is cheap, but still makes a great costume. I was disappointed by the graphic novel, which I found disjointed and confusing. Very few of the characters seemed to be developed in depth, and some of the side plots seemed to be randomly tossed into the story as ""filler"". In my opinion, Watchmen was much better than this graphic novel."
5,The War on Information Continues...,"""V for Vendetta"" is one of the best pieces of work I've read in a long time. I strongly feel that everyone should have it in their personal library! This book / movie exposes the massive deception that is regularly carried out on a daily basis by our mis-Leaders. When a tiny group of elites own the media (like in the US), it's becomes relatively easy to manipulate an entire population. Besides the action and great plot, this is one of the many things that I enjoyed about this movie and book. Eventhough it's classified as fiction, one can plainly see the parrallel to what has happened to our freedom in the past 5 years. The message is clear, ""People should not be afraid of their governments, governments should be afraid of their people!""Dr. Matthew J. Loop- Author of ""Cracking the Cancer Code"""
5,Moore's Genre-Bending Masterpiece,V sits perfectly on my shelf next to Brave New World & 1984. Comics-Noir meets Ayn Rand. The chilling surrealist story is perfectly complimented by the dramatic visual presentation. It's a gripping as a Stanley Kubrik movie. 5 stars are simply not enough for this monumental testament.
2,Huh?,"I'll give Lloyd credit for the 'cool', creepy cover. But seriously, isn't this just a comic book version of the rebel against Big Brother? Seriously? How more hackneyed can you get? The Finger; The Voice of Fate; the Nose? I gave it more than a star because there was some attempt at character development, and it was interesting at times. The artwork overall is well, let's say it sometimes reminds me of Cole for Plastic Man. Sloppy at times, though I don't know if this was the intention, but sloppy does impart a very atmospheric and gritty feel when done right."
2,"great story, but poorly executed","The idea of a masked terrorist fighting back against a totalitarian government is a interesting story, but the characters in THIS story are weak at best! Some of the dialogue is hokey and the artwork is muddled..."
1,i'm not a kid,"i'm not a kid and if i could i would give this zero stars. I picked this up because i was interested in the controversy surrounding the movie. I read 40 pages and returned it to the book store. all the book is, is Christian bashing. this book is disgusting, please stay away from it. do not buy this book, it is terrible and blatantly anti-Christian"
5,The book that got me back into comics.,"There's nothing I can write here that hasn't been written before. So, I'll just say that this is an amazing work that comic and non-comic fans alike will really take to."
5,Lo mejor de Moore,"Todo llego en buen tiempo y excelente estado, hasta mi natal ciudad irapuato, gto. Mexico"
5,expect the unexpected...,"if you're considering buying this book, know one thing: its not an action story. dont expect high flying machine gun blazing antics from V, a point where Evey picks up a machine gun, yells ""for father!"" and plows down 50 some odd police officers, or anything else of the sort. the story is a tale of a dystopian Britain, a facist government now facing down an anti-hero, anarchist vigilante named ""V"". If you enjoy the sort of story with a lot of comparison between two ""evils""- facism and anarchy, or the tale of Guy Fawkes, or are a fan of Moore's other work (or George Orwell's 1984), this book will probably suit you well. be warned, however, there are relatively few ""action"" sequences, and the movie will have to stray far from the book to make it a fall blockbuster action movie."
5,One of Moore's overlooked gems,"This one's a classic, no doubt about it. An exceptionally well-presented anti-totalitarian theme couched in an entertaining narrative. The Wachowski brothers of THE MATRIX fame want to make this their next non-Matrix film... I just can't wait. Any fan of graphic storytelling HAS to read this, and anyone who's scoffed at the medium previously should give it a try and be bowled over. Superior work, and better than most of what I've read in prose lately."
4,Commancheros,Another great John Wayne western. These old westerns will never be lost cause they represent the old west as most of us really want it to be. I was a stuntman in those days and was lucky eough to work on this film.
3,I'M GONNA GO OUT WEST AND WRESTLE ME A GRIZZLY BEAR,"Texas Ranger, (John Wayne) enlists the aid of wanted fugitive, (Stuart Whitman), to bust gunrunning operation. Everything you can expect from a Wayne western, with eye-popping Cinerama,(or whatever they called it in 1961), rousing musical theme that becomes a little less so by the fourth or fifth ride into the sunset, dancing skirt sashaying senioritas, (hoochie-koochie, anyone?), standard western stunts, (falling horses, especially), and a still cloudy distinction of the American Indian as being either 'wild', (bloodthirsty scalpers of white people), or 'tame', (sell their soul for a cheap bottle of whiskey and a good cigar). Love interest Ina Bolin, (dark, mysterious, like you can picture a whip in her hand), adds some Mexican zing to the mix, but man, those are some nasty wigs she wears."
4,Fun movie - Please release on DVD,"This is what movies used to be - no blood across the screen, just a couple of hours of fun and enjoyment - and a great soundtrack.Hopefully, it'll be released on DVD soon."
5,A must for your Western Library,One of John Wayne's better Action Western Classics. Acting is average with some laughable spots in this movie.
3,Not one of Duke's Best,"This was a reasonably entertaining movie but just not as classic as many of Wayne's Westerns. The plot was a little too simplistic, and, as with many Westerns made in the 50s and 60s, too little attention is paid to authenticity. One glaring example-- the firearms and ammunition used in the movie were not around until the 1860s, 20 years after the period the movie was set in."
4,The Comancheros Blue Ray 50th Anniversary Edition,Perhaps not John Wayne's best but plenty of action and humour in this enjoyable western. This 50th anniversary edition has a good if not exceptional blue ray transfer.
4,Great,Purchased for my Dad who is almost blind and a big John Waye fan. He was thrilled.Response was Great
4,Worth Crowing about,"Wayne as in any of his other great movies is larger than life. As a Texas Ranger his methods are not to be denied. Lee Marvin although only having a brief part plays it to the hilt as Crow, a hard as nails gun trader. Stuart Whittman is excellent as Monseur Paul Regret. We can understand why he was chosen to play in the TV series Cimarron Strip. He plays a credible Louisianan of class. Ina Balin does a fine job as the daughter of a wealthy outlaw. Several cameos including Patrick Wayne, the dukes son. The story, cast, and music add up to a sprawling western well worth owning. The DVD picture quality and sound are superb. I especially noticed how sharp the red credits are on the DVD since on most VHS or TV viewings they bleed like the bad guys."
1,Why no widescreen?,"This a great later Wayne movie with a rather Bond like approach - meglomaniac villain bent on world domination (well Texas anyway),one liners and great action. It is also one of the great sixties Cinemascope westerns, with spectacular Utah locations, so why is it being released in full frame only?This is available on Laserdisc in widescreen, stereo and with a good commentary from the cast (Pat Wayne not John), is aired on UK BBC channels in widescreen and stereo, so is this the best Fox can do?"
1,Drunk Indians,"This movie was good for the most part but then again if you dont want to see drunk indians shoot white people then dont worry about seeing it. There were some good parts in this movie but the whole movie was a rather large dissapointment. These Indains would kill people so they could get their Jollies off by getting alcohol for it, even though the story wasnt to be based on this. This movie was very unrealistic as far as that actually happening, like if someone to be arrested they wouldnt be let go OR given a gun, and all the actors should be reformed and be made better through my eyes. I take my reviews very serioulsly and this movie was not that good at all, do not let your children be scared by watching this movie. John Wayne was a good actor props to my man Wayne, he's my man. However his career could have been a lot better off had he not made this movie."

5,A Humorous Western!,John Wayne proves how versatile an actor he is! In this movie he's funny and serious as well! The supporting actors are great as well!A great flick!
5,COMANCHEROS,"ANOTHER PERFECT MATCH, WAYNE AND MARVIN SADDLED UP AGAIN FOR A VERY ENTERTAINING MOVIE,MARVIN AS 'CROW'FITTED THIS PART LIKE A GLOVE, WAYNE AND WHITMAN, BLENDED WELL TOGETHER AND ELMER BERNTEIN'S MUSIC FOR THE FILM, WELL WHAT MORE IS THERE TO SAY? THEY JUST DON'T MAKE 'EM LIKE THIS ANYMORE, LET THEM KEEP THERE 3D AND ALL THIS DIGITAL SPECIAL EFFECTS,MIND YOU WAY BACK WAYNE STARRED IN 'HONDO' WHICH WAS 'SHOT' IN 3D, NEVER MIND 32 YEARS DEAD, AND STILL RETAINS HIS RATING, AS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR STARS OF ALL TIME!"
1,Mic volume is too low,"Volume of the earpiece is ok. Quality is not perfect, but it's enough for a phone conversation.However the downside is the volume of the microphone. My contacts could not hear me. Only when I put the microphone in front of my mouth they could here me well.Idea was nice, design was cool, microphone sucks."
4,Son of the Morning Star,"I have been to the battlefield and have read and seen numerous documentaries of the Big Horn"" battle (even watched the made for television series by the same title as this book), and I can say that the series was not as good as the book and neither has anything else I have seen or read about that fatal day in Montana over one hundred and thirty years ago."
3,All over the place,"A very good read but a bit to ""all over the place"". Hard to follow at times as it jumped around. But, learned some great insights of a place I have visited many times."
3,"Jumbled is right, but good info","The author obviously did some painstaking research of US Army records, comtemporary letters, news articles, records of interviews,and other sources. The amount of information presented and discussion of the data is vast and comprehensive. I very much enjoyed the read from that aspect. I just wish it had been presented in a more cohesive and flowing manner. It's not so chronological or by person or by Army vs the 5 or 6 tribes, it just jumps around."
1,horrible -no flow,"This is the worse book ever. Constant jumping around, no flow, no attempt to pull it together. If you want to learn about events leading up to Little Big Horn, don't choose this book. Dissapointing."
2,huge disappointment.,"i have had this book in my library for a long time and very much looked forward to reading it. a book that got rave reviews by critics, an outstanding novelist (evan s connell) writing about the legendary downfall of custer at little bighorn, how could i go wrong with this one. well, i guess that there is no such thing as a sure thing, because i found this book way too long & way too tedious. the author digresses all throughout the book, dropping the narrative and taking off on dull useless sidetracks that should never have been included. dozens and dozens of characters are introduced that you will never rememeber (and will never need to remember). strange and poor organization make this book a real dud. too bad."
1,Huh?,"Thought the book was disjointed, difficult to follow and not very interesting. Instead of this garbled mess, read Wert or Monaghan."
5,"Why Custer rode, in Wagnerian style, into his Valhalla","As the highest compliment, I think that's the best way to summarize Connell's ground-level look at Custer's last months and weeks leading upto and into the Little Bighorn/Greasy Grass.Writing at times with a style as sparse, lean and dry as the High Plains battle site, Connell also uses an almost cinematic handling of the larger scale narrative, cutting from opening chapters about the lead-up to the battle to go backward to the start of Custer's service in the Indian Wars, then back forward again.The result is to frame Custer the person squarely in the defining moment of his last battle.Connell's work gives Custer's doom that Wagnerian-type sense of inevitibility, as though he had crossed the Rainbow Bridge for his Ragnarok at Little Bighorn."
3,Lots of Facts & Analysis -- Brutal Organization or Lack Thereof,"This slightly dated work by an accomplished novelist is well worth slugging through its lack of organization and meanderings to extract the huge compendium of facts contained therein. Please note; while other readers have thought this was an historical novel, it isn't fiction. It would deserve five stars if better organized and possessed a better index, but alas, one can't have everything. The reader will read and note a fact or story, but find himself unable to locate it later without reading through the entire book again.The ""slightly dated"" aspect is deserved as it, a 1984 work, does not contain the archeological data unearthed by Fox et al since that time. Nonetheless, for sheer facts, statements, and opinions, this is the reader's single best source on the Battle of the Little Bighorn.I recommend this book for purchase and reading."
3,"Good solid read, but too much ramble and skipping","While this is a very solid book, full of great facts and 'inside' stories, it does tend to ramble in areas and skip around on tangents.If you like historical books with more traditional structure, like chronological order or the full completion of a topic, then skip this book.If you like a deep and probing structure, with a lot of tangents, then this book is for you.It will only be re-read by me in my retired years as it was somewhat of a chore.I will skip commenting on the presentation of the battle and 'which side' to take, as the author does a solid job in presenting both sides."
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"I didn't find this book hard to follow at all. Even when I was sleepy I knew what I was reading about. It is the characters in this book and the back drop that brings this story alive. Connell does a great job of bringing unknown and well known characters to life and giving them more than just a name and place of death. What a story this is when you add up all the sum parts. And, I was able to get a bigger picture than just the death of Custard from reading this great book."
5,Very Enlightening,Very good. Very factual and incormative. I have read it several times and because of this book I drove 1500 miles to visit the battlefield.
5,A MARVELOUS DEFINITION OF AN ERA,"Evan Connell has masterfully given us not only an excellent account of the event and the participants, but insight on a way of life in the last century. The amount of information he has compiled is remarkable. A riveting read for those of us who enjoy meandering through America's past."
4,Not as fluffy as Bridget Jones,"Reinventing Olivia was an amusing read. I read it in one sitting, and immediately decided to recommend it to a friend. It's like a cross between Wally Lamb's, She's Come Undone, and Helen Fielding's, Bridget Jones' Diary. The heroine is oversensitive and self-critical, but just enough to make us sympathize with her, not enough to make her pathetic. Also, the plot had some pleasantly surprising twists.The only problem is that the price is too high for this kind of book. To merit the $30 the publisher wants, it needs to be twice as long and/or have photographs, embossed cover, or engravings or something."
1,Rehash anfd recycle.,"This book is a rehash of some not so great Nation columns. Big on rhetoric, poor on follow through and no real research. Read Webb's book instead."
3,Engaging,"Dark Alliance this is not. Dark Alliance was good in that Webb attributed his sources throughout the text. These authors chose to bunch their sources as endnotes concluding each chapter. Bad move. Perhaps in a later edition they should correct this (i.e., use footnotes instead). The way they did it makes it read like the National Enquirer in places. Otherwise, I feel the book continues an important discussion regarding the CIA & the role gov't corruption plays in our society."
4,an important book,"a concise, dense, distilled synthesis representing the cumulative result of almost sixty years of investigation and research. an important book to be sure, yet the narrative suffers somewhat due to the ambitious all-encompassing scope of the material."
4,The last track is my favorite,"A great collection of music! Thought provoking-I especially like ""Dirty Wind""!!!"
4,Hawkwind - 'The Stonehenge Collection' (Cleopatra) 2-CD,"I know for a fact that I have the two seperate CD releases of these Hawkwind titles on the Griffin label. Forgot all about Cleopatra putting out this 2-CD pressing of the twin mid-'80's album ressues of 'Zones' ('83) and 'This Is Hawkwind, Do Not Panic' ('84) - when co-founder Nik Turner had rejoined for awhile. Was nice to hear ""Motorway City"", the awesome ""Utopia 84"", ""Psy Power"", ""Shot Down In The Night"" and the brilliant Harvey Bainbridge / Turner's futuristic piece ""Watching The Grass Grow"" again."
5,Kachina and the Cross,"Marvelous book, gives a clear understanding of what happened in New Mexico during the 17th century. A must read!"
3,Disappointed,"While I knew these were nylon, I expected the top elastic to last longer. By the end of the first day they were bags around my ankles. I am still searching for those knee highs/trouser socks that stay UP!"
2,Great artist but inferior recording,I love Buddy Holly's music but I was very disappointed with the quality of this recording.
4,not the best collection,"When the movie ""The Buddy Holly Story"" came out in the late '70's alot of Buddy holly's music was available on records and Eight track tapes,I really liked ""Buddy Holly Lives"" there were tracks on that one that aren't on MCA'S current line up like ""Brown Eyed Hansome Man"". but all in all this is a pretty good starting point for anyone wanting a taste of Buddy holly's music."
3,More re-package of Buddy's hits? Give me a break!,"Why are we getting another cd of Buddy's hits again? This makes no sense. I wish the people at Universal Music or even better, Bear Family records would give us that long awaited (too long actually) boxed set we've been waiting for. 5 stars for the music of course, but only 3 for the compilation idea itself."
5,A simply great CD if limited for room or budget!,"I can't believe that they are actually bad reviews on this compilation. There are 26 classics here...all in excellent sound..on one disc. I also have the Buddy Holly Collection, an excellent 2 disc set that carries 50 songs. But if you are limited in space...want just one CD...and on a budget..this is the best deal out there. All of these songs have stood the test of time. It's amazing how many of his songs have been covered later on by such varied artists as Elvis, Peter & Gordon, Linda Ronstadt, Rolling Stones, The Beatles, James Taylor, Blind Faith (w/Clapton & Winwood) and others. He will prove to be an enduring songwriter of classic rock as well as a wonderful early rock band. He was only 22 when he perished on Feb. 3, 1959. I was 13 when I heard the news. One of the saddest days I can remember. He was a good kid too."
1,couldn't play it,skipped something awful. not worth giving as a gift.{ Why do I have to use eleven more words before I can submit this review? Thats the silliest rule I have ever seen. Sometimes just one or two words can describe something perfectly. Like crap. Or garbage. } Is that enough words for you?
3,Not the original show.,Be aware that this is not the original TV show - it's from a stage show in Branson.
5,The Best of The Live Shows From Branson,"This is a WONDERFUL show that was taped before many of the good old stars were still alive. Some very good music, dancing and singing are on this show. Picture quality and sound are first rate. I highly recommend it."
5,A wonderful class taught by a terrific teacher...,"The four cds glow with great warmth, personal insights, and effective teachings in a very sensitive arena. I found them very helpful and would recommend this ""course"" to anyone who is troubled by a past or present ""resentful"" relationship with anyone, including himself or herself."
3,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.","Stanley Cavell is a Professor of Philosophy at Harvard University and the author of two wonderful books (PURSUITS OF HAPPINESS and THE SENSES OF WALDEN). He is also the author of, at least, one unreadable book: THE CLAIM OF REASON. All three are adequately represented in this collection. In addition, the editor includes a fine essay on Kierkegaard. Sadly, one of Cavell's most famous pieces, the early essay on EXISTENTIALISM AND ANALYTICAL PHILOSOPHY was excluded. Overall, there's some of Cavell at his best, and at his worst, in these pages (at times his prose can get pretty ugly)."
2,Fake Flavoring,"The flavoring of this coffee is very ""fake"" - it's ok if you tend to like the artificially-flavored syrups used in coffee, or if you like the typical flavored coffees. It's not for me - I want a subtle real flavor and a strong coffee. This one doesn't do it. Fool's pumpkin spice is a better bet for a decaf pumpkin spice."
3,Fireheart,"Joanna Neville was brought up in the Lenni Lenape tribe, but she was sent away at fourteen to be with her uncle in England. There, the ""savage"" was quite literally beaten out of her. Seven years later, she comes home to her tribe, leaving her recently inherited estate in the hands of her friend, John Burton. Among the Lenni Lenape she comes face to face with her past in the form of Fireheart, whom she used to know as Yellow Deer. As a young girl, she had snubbed him for his older, manlier friends. But he is promised to another, although he feels an attraction to her. And John Burton, who came all the way from England to find her and bring her back, is showing himself to be anything but a friend...."
2,Not up to usual Candace McCarthey Style,"I looked forward to every book Candace McCarthey has, but this was a major disappointment. Her usual style of in depth characterization was not prominent in this story. I could not even 'get into' the story. Also, her story in Affairs of the Heart was not up to usual quality.I suggest you skip this book and buy one of her earlier books."
2,Not much repeat watchability...,"First be advised that this is an Italian made sci-fi. The soundtrack has been adequately dubbed into english however the Aplha print is VERY poor and there is a large audio hissing throughout the entire feature.While the script and acting is competent enough, I found it boring with minimal special effects. I cannot really pinpoint the reason, but it is very different from the sci-fi films made in the US at this same time. The whole thing had a kind of surreal quality to it. I found it hard to get into. I found the other popular lost Italian sci-fi flick 'Caltiki the Immortal Monster' much more watchable. DTSE is recommended only for completeists ONLY.If you are looking for very good, lesser known 50's sci-fi titles to add to your collection, try hunting down Unknown World, First Man into Space, Creature with the Atom Brain, Lost Missile, Rocketship XM or Donovan's Brain. All very solid 50's sci-fi films with great repeat watchability."
3,Asteroids? Don't They Have A Cream For That?...,"An astronaut is forced to abort earth's first manned space mission when things go horribly wrong. Uh-Oh! He forgot to turn off the ship's atomic engine before ejecting himself out of danger! This sends the capsule hurtling through space, right into a cluster of asteroids, causing these titanic hunks of rock to merge into one giant mass! What's worse, this super-asteroid is now heading straight for planet earth! In this story, the UN takes action immediately, scrambling all forces necessary to deal with the deadly crisis. Of course, this is sci-fi. In reality, the UN would convene in order to call a future meeting, so they could decide on whether to pass a resolution on whether or not to implement a plan. Thankfully, the fictional UN saves the day. TDTSE (which cost about 50 to make) is the precursor to movies like ARMEGEDDON and DEEP IMPACT, and is actually better than either of these pieces of multi-million dollar drek! Enjoy..."
1,office movie w/ sec.s of action...,"just when i was tryin to leave the office to see a good movie-its not this one; it only had a total of seconds in action-(at the end,where most of the seconds are). it has horrible film quality on dvd i got. after buying this, i realized i was trying to get perhaps, when worlds collide?-((which is much better-i think this one has the sky exploding at the end-ongoing waves of light in the sky.))"
4,"Informal, nice text","A very informal style of writing with lots of explanation. He doesn't skip large steps like in the old-fashioned terse style of math texts, which makes it very readable, though some readers may not like it. Not very rigorous, but he's upfront about it.The original version from 1996 has quite a few errors, and the author maintains information on errata on his website. The most recent reprinting has corrected most of these errors. So, even though there is only a single edition, some versions have errors and some don't. So, BEWARE BUYING USED EDITIONS because they will most likely be from an earlier printing and thus have more errors. I assume the new version on amazon is the corrected version."
2,"Not bad, could be better","Text generally follows the standard definition-theorem-proof format. The writing style is informal and abbreviated, but the presentation is usually rigorous. That said, this is not a learning text: the utter lack of worked examples is frustrating, as are the poorly labeled graphs scattered throughout (in fact, some of the graphs aren't labeled at all). I don't mind working when I read a mathematics text. But I also don't like having to guess what things mean, or how to use results. Too often this text forced me to guess. Inclusion of worked, explanatory examples would have been helpful in this regard. Each chapter comes equipped with a set of exercises. Many of these are quite challenging. Overall, a serious and demanding text."
4,Its pretty good,"I just recently purchased this DVD. After reading the very funny review making reference to Robert Sherman being a ""Podman""...I was hesitant...but it turned out to be a good decision.Yes...he does look very robotic..but the workout is good....and depending on how advanced u are...it can be made hard.The only downside I found was the workouts being very similar. The foundation ride and the interval ride...its just that the interval ride is alittle more aggressive.I did appreciate how Robert Sherman made reference to proper posture...and give alternative pacing for beginners.Definitely worth the purchase."
3,Challenging but Instructor is Irritating,"So far this is my favorite cycling workout. It is definitely challenging. I tend to mute the sound to avoid listening to Robert Sherman. Several of his motivational pep talks are demotivational. One segment goes like this...""Inside I know you want to give up, inside I know you want to sit down, stay with me a little longer...."" It makes me want to get out of my bike and put a duct tape over his mouth."
5,Excellent Home Workout,"Like most parents trying to balance work and taking care of kids, a workout can be pushed to the side. This spinning video is hard work and really gets you sweating and cooled down in 40 min -- great for a nap time workout. Much is said about Robert Sherman in these reviews. I found that even though he's talking to me from the TV during the workout, he kept me going when I thought I might stop. I'm off to buy his other spin video."
4,Great refresher or for first timers!,"I instruct cycling classes and wanted to gain some other or new skills especially in the way of motivating my classes. Robert Sherman is thorough with instructions re: form, intensity; as well as motivating his class. I did pick up a couple of new teaching ideas which is what I wanted. However, for advanced indoor or outdoor riders wanting to use this as a training video - there is a lot of cueing, and I personally find instructors that talk a whole bunch distracting. But because this is instructional, I get the purpose - thus ideal as refresher or for newbies."
3,Good for training,Hubby does triathlons and does this on occasion. He prefers to just ride and watch tv but will use these to change things up.
1,ROBOT,"Yikes. This video is lame. I agree with other reviewers, this guy is a complete robot. No excitement, no enthusiasm, and just plain boring. I think Robert was too worried about losing his Patrick Swayze look. This DVD is going in the trash; a total waste of cash."
5,Bit over the top but a good workout,Dude takes himself pretty darn serious -- but he does hold your attention and by the end it is a satisfying workout. This DVD has two good spinning workouts.
1,waste of money,"Unless you have never ridden a bicycle before, this video is a complete waste of time. It is much more motivating to watch a blank wall while you ride. At least then, you can listen to real music, too."
1,"funny if you have the time, not funny if you want a training dvd","this is a bizarre video and highly not recommended. I am still not sure if the ""host"" is actually a real human being or perhaps some sort of pod person, unfortunately for me, this is one of the dvd's to come up in a search on netflix for cycling training, there are so many bicycling movies they could have stocked other than this."
1,Never Received,"I would love to have rated this, and would have if it would have shown up!I ordered this in December, before the holidays and never received it."
1,Is this DVD a pirated copy?,"I enjoy the VHS copy that I own, but the sound quality on this DVD is AWFUL. I hope this video will be eventually released by a legitimate source."
2,Really bad DVD transfer,"This would be a bad VHS copy too. I tested it on two separate systems and still got ghosting lines down the screen. Too bad, the subject material is very pretty and the music is slick."
2,Poor quality transfer,An awesome subject is ruined by a careless video transfer. Very grainy appearance.
3,Slightly disapointing,"Buying the DVD version, I was expecting a big improvement over the VHS copy I had bought a few years back. Unfortunately the video quality of the DVD is only slightly better. It still has too much grain in the picture for me. Not a good demonstration DVD but the music is still good!"
3,Not his best,"This is a decent cd, but I was much more impressed by the albums Charlie Hunter and Duo.As previous reviewers have noted, yes, there are a lot of vibes. If you don't like vibes, you might not dig this album. There is nothing wrong with the way they were recorded.Some of the things I didn't like were the cover of Fly like an Eagle, which I find semi-tolerable as a pop song and annoying as a jazz tune. Also there are some really cool jams that meld together, one of which I think was based on a tribe called quest song, but they are too short! Charlie should have spent more time grooving on this album, and less time covering Steve Miller songs."
2,This ringing is killing me,"This album should be called ""A bunch of Bells-featuring Charlie Hunter"". I just recently purchased Duo, With Charlie and Leon. I was so impressed I thought I would check out more of his material. The Candyman album will be going back to the candy store. Very depressing. Check out Natty Dread....This album saves the twisted impression I received from the talented guitarist."
2,product not as pictured,"This product is NOT as pictured. It is in fact the ""earbud"" style of earphones. I should have returned them when I saw this but decided to give them a try. It was a mistake. The sound was decent, but the earbud style did not stay in place. They were o.k. as long as you did nothing and stayed completely still, not even yawning or chewing. Otherwise they tended to fall out often. Definitely not suitable for any type of activity. Maybe my ear canals are a little larger or smaller than average so that is why they don't stay in place, but there was only the one size of ear piece provided. If you have had good luck with the earbud style of earphone in the past, this would be o.k., otherwise not worth the cost for something that may not be of any use."
5,"Awesome transaction, could not have gone better!","Tiger Direct is phenomenal! Exactly the products I needed at a great price with super-fast shipping. I received the items in perfect condition much faster than I expected.On a side note about the Zip-Linq retractable headphones, the sound quality is WAY better than I expected, which is primarily why I stuck with the Zip-Linq name instead of some bad knock-off, but the sound quality really is very good, especially for earbuds. Way to go Zip-Linq!Thank you Tiger Direct!! I've been a customer for years, with no end in sight. Keep up the good work!"
4,Pristene recording (Hansel & Gretel),"This transfer of the H&G 1946 78 set (I have one) is excellent, no noise,clicks ,or pops,even the 'hiss' inherent in 78 recordings is absent..a true joy to listen to.Sounds like the 'source' set of disks were never played...sadly, 'alice"" is excellent ,EXCEPT tracks 20 to end, (suspect my cd might be defective,)as those last few tracks,are horribly distorted, and un-intelligible..... Im so pleased with the H & G recording-source material,,that I can over look problems with ""Alice"". DEF reccomend this item, especially if you grew up with it, Rathbone's performance is wonderfull.."
2,"Sadly, Made In China","The Irwin Company has a long tradition of quality products that are made in the USA. Their Vise Grip brand comes to mind. In an effort to cut cost, deplete the US economy of jobs, and boost their profit margin they are now marketing this cheap import with their name attached. No where on the discription of the product do they tell you that it is made in China. Only after you get it are you disappointed.Moral of story ... buy from Ridgid!"
1,Not Practical,"I agree that while the book is a series of lovely photograghs, it is not even vaguely helpful or practical in terms of entertainment tips"
2,"You Mean ""Adult Art""","If you're going to write a children's book celebrating children's art, or the creative process of a child, then why make the culimating moment of the story be an adult's illustration meant to look like a child's? A cliche imitation of what our culture generally thinks of as a child's drawing, no less. What a cop out! As an elementary school teacher, I can think of a hundred more powerful and original ways to explore children's art, most of which would include beautiful artwork made by children, or at least something by an adult which captures the spirit in a more authentic way. I also found the color scheme boring. Pretty much everybody thinks they can write a great children's book, from Billy Joel to Jerry Seinfeld. It ain't so, and it ends up being an abuse of an art form that appears effortless but is truly very tricky."
4,Worth Reading,"For a simple look at the Franco-Prussian war, one needs to look no further than Stephen Badsey's ""The Franco-Prussian War."" His 92 page book covers all the battles and, in particular, the events leading to the war. All other events surrounding the war, such as the revolution in France that it caused, are covered though not explored in depth, as they are topics for other books.It's apparent Stephen Badsey researched the topic well and writes for understanding, reflecting his lecturing background. The numerous maps are excellent; I have never read a book where every single placename is on an accompanying map; making the text and the battles easy to follow."
4,The Cliff Notes of military history,"The ""Essential Histories"" series from Osprey could easily be compared to the Cliff Notes series. They'll give you a nice introduction to a topic you are not familiar with, but no real depth. Most volumns are under 100 pages; therefore, don't expect many ""man in the trenches"" stories.This book is a nice introduction to a relatively small war that would have very much to do with the animosities of the two later World Wars. Grab this before you start your studies of the Great War."
4,Good stuff,Blues covers of rock tunes;done well.Had the pleasure of a surprise visit by Daddy to a juke joint I migrated to outside of Memphis town one night. Jammed to the wee hours of the morning for everyone on hand. Cool!!!
5,Great dvd,This is a great tutorial on the triangle. I've watched the whole thing through twice. Currently watching it a 3rd time. It's really improved my triangle choke.
1,NO NO NO,"Very flimsy, tried to back off the screw and it broke in my hand, if I could give this product ""O"" stars I would! Spend more get a better product!"
4,Good for Ruger 10/22 with synthetic stock,"This worked well to use with a USGI sling for an Appleseed event. You use the wood screw for the rear location and the machine screw for the front (hollow stock). It took me about 25 minutes and you'll want a drill and a few bits. Thread-locker is a good idea as well if you have it.Be careful when selecting the spot for the front swivel mount. I initially drilled a hole that interfered with the location of the plastic barrel clamp once it was reassembled. You may need to go back 1/4"" to 1/2"" from where the instructions tell you. The clearance is quite close for whether or not the front bolt will fit without touching the barrel. If it's touching or too close, you can cut or grind the bolt down slightly OR add an extra washer to the outside to take up a little space.It's not a hard job. Good luck!"
2,He tried too hard,"The author seemed to be trying for a homey Southern novel with quirky characters, but he tried too hard and the results were not appealing. Perhaps something to read while waiting in the dentist's office."
3,Requisite Quirky Southern Personalities,"I never thought that this book would end. Being a totally character driven book filled with the requisite quirky Southern personalities, you are introduced to Laurie Lepanto and her group of widowed ladies who call themselves the Nitwitts, Laurie's dashing dancing man Powell, the lovelorn Mr. Choppy and various other personalities of Second Creek, Mississippi. In an effort to keep open the local Piggly Wiggly, that is being edged out of town by the new Mega Mart, Laurie and her Nitwitts decide to offer a waltz with Powell down the isles of the Piggly Wiggly while the box boys gather up their orders. Little does anybody know, but this is one can of worms that Mr. Choppy didn't know would change his life forever."
2,Waltzing into Mediocrity,"I really wanted to read this book. It was well-reviewed by Ann Ross and I like small-town books. (I'm a small town girl, what can I say?) It is, however, an excellent example of what can happen if a great idea isn't properly nurtured.The premise is promising, but it never quite comes through. There are quirky characters aplenty, but they're too quirky, too over the top. Dalby also tried to weave in romance and does a poor job with it. Both are underdeveloped and crassly handled. The man lacks subtlety, that's all I can say.Beyond that, I just didn't care about the book. I didn't care whether the characters married, whether the store closed, or why Mr. Choppy lost his finger. I just wanted out of the book.That being said, I had a hard time rating the book. I mean, how do you rate a book that was so blah you don't even care enough to give it an F?It gets D- for Very Dull."
5,One of the Best!,"I had this book read to me on audio cassette. I was so bewitched, I listened to it twice in a row. The reading takes 22+ hours and since I drive a lot, it was the perfect timing for me. But truly, this is one of the best books I have ever""read"" and now plan on buying a hard copy so I can share it with my friends and family that do not have that much time in a car to listen. Please, read this book if you LOVE reading as I do!!!"
4,Drum of Immortality,"The book is meant for people who take an openminded view about the history of the world's religions. The author uses his own life experience as a government official stationed in Laos during the 70's, where he first encountered Buddhist teachings. During that time he read the Dhammapada, the Buddhist ""bible"", and became a student of the ancient religion. He draws interesting comparisons between the teachings of Buddha and Christ, even though there were centuries separating their lives on Earth. The author lists passages both from Christ and Buddha on certain topics, the meaning to which appear similar. The reader is left to draw his own conclusions as to whether Christ traveled to the East during his ""lost years"" to study Buddhism. It is an interesting read, and is definitely thought-provoking for anyone interested in religious history and teachings."
4,What a life!,"I know of Donald Haack as he has stores here in Charlotte, but I had no idea of the life he had led. A facinating read. A little rough around the edges but a great story. This book covers Donald as he and his wife and later two children travel to South America to make their home and a go at the diamond trade. The diamonds are few and far between but the adventures of this bush pilot are not. I highly recommend"
5,Total adventure,"Excellent book! While the first chapter may be a little slow, keep reading! The rest of the book will have you so engrossed you won't want to put it down. I found myself laughing uproariously or sitting on the edge of my seat wondering how he was going to get out of this one! It's a total adventure. If you have any question about if this book is for you, listen to the Diane Rehm interview on the NPR website. Donald Haack is a fascinating character."
5,Colleen's talent for comedy shines through!,"Having known Collen since college, I can attest to her flair for comedy, dialogue and plot. We've collaborated on a few writing projects together, and her talent as a writer an an editor is unparalleled. As a comedy writer (and peformer), she's combined the best of both worlds in this engaging tale of love lost, found, and rewarded. It's a definite mood elevator!"
4,so bad it's a classic,"When I finally get around to mentioning ""The Big Meat Eater"", to people who are finally in my circle of movie friends (whom I number very few), I always say that it's the Canadian Rocky Horror. Strangely catchy musical numbers, very low budget special effects, and so many plots it should be 6 movies, a couple classic characters, this movie has it all. Bear in mind this was the 80's, but if you loved Repo-man, you should find something to smile (or groan) about in this slice of z grade cinema."
1,This is a badly written book.,"This book taught me nothing. What is worse, I bought it under duress; the author took advantage of his position as the giver of grades, and commited the ultimate example of bad form: forced his book's purchase upon students who rely on him for a grade."
5,ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!!,"I've used many cordless drills over the years, but none compare to this jewel from Milwaukee. This has got to be the most incredible cordless drill on the market.....easily outperforms many 18V drills including DeWalt (quickly becoming a ""consumer"" line of tools) and Makita. The motor is strong and full of torque, chuck is easy to use in changing out bits. The selectable load range is a nice feature. The battery will connect from the front or rear of the grip to accomodate the space on your job. The carry case is handy and helps protect the drill in the truck or during transport. Batteries charge quickly with the included charger. Don't spend the extra money for an 18V drill...you don't need to with this 14.4V gem. I can't say enough about the superb performance of this cordless drill. I don't loan it out, because I'm afraid I won't get it back!!"
5,Everything expected from a Milwaukee Tool,This drill is wonderful for a 14.4V. Well designed and functions as well as every Milwaukee tool I own. Five year warranty is very nice as well. All my tools are Milwaukee and I'll continue to keep it that way.
4,drill,I like the drill. I would like longer battery life. It seems to die when I need more thime. This package has a second battery.
5,He loves it!,"I bought this for my boyfriend who is a sub-contractor and Mr. Fix-It around the house. He loves it! It keeps its charge, it has plenty of attachments, and I also purchased the extra bit set that he uses a lot too."
3,Over rated!,"The belt attachment looked good on the box but once you get around to use it you'll get a charlie horse from the contraption. Three months after I purchase this drill I sent it back to milwaukee to be fixed. six months after that the battery died, I gave up and sold it for $70 bucks and purchased a bosch drill ""problem solved"""

3,Poland just OK,"Polish American philanthropist and founder of Mrs. Pauls' Kitchens, Edward J. Piszek, convinced his friend, James Michener, to write a novel about Poland at the time of Solidarity's dramatic face-off with the then-communist Polish government.The improbable spine of the novel is the relationship between two Polish families spanning the entire one-thousand-year history of the country.Somehow Michener was able to cram in most of Poland's notable historical events, so if you're only able to digest history in novel-form, then ""Poland"" is not a bad option. However, the big drawback to this book, for those who may be contemplating buying it, is that it was published in 1984. A lot of water has gone under the bridge since then.For anyone interested in learning about Poland, I recommend you spend your time reading a well-researched and easy-to-read contemporary history such as Adam Zamoyski's ""Poland."""
2,Junk literature,I firstly read Michener's Poland and then H. Mankiewicz trilogy. Junk literature Mr. Michener's book.
5,Best book,This was like finding a treasure. It should be raked in the top ten books of all time. Very good account of Polish history.
2,Very disappointing,"Poland has such a rich history, it's hard to believe that this is the best that Michener could do. The problem is he tries to cover too much ground; there's breadth but no depth. When he does get to the interesting parts (each of which could rightfully be a book in themselves) they're glossed over. ""Poland"" is ponderous, dull, and a huge disappointment. A conventional history by, say, Norman Davies, would be more entertaining and more informative.Not recommended"
5,Door Wide Open,Beautiful and elegant. Any woman who's ever been in love with a difficult man will appreciate Joyce Johnson's bittersweet romance.
3,Groan...,"I'm not sure why everyone else has rated this book so highly--I've found it to be quite banal, and sometimes down-right painful to read. Johnson comes across as a bland, naive and gullable girl who tries to play up to Kerouac in order to win his dubious affection. Her letters are written in a most childish and lame manner, and I can't believe that she was published a few years later. I hate to say such a thing, but it's true. Needless to say, their affair--calling it a love affir is streaching it a tad--eventually ends, and now forty years later she's decided to publish their exchange of letters in order to assure her fifteen minutes of fame. The fact that this book does provide a little insight into Kerouac keeps it from being two stars."
4,A Picture of Kerouac's World,"This book was plesure to read simply because of Joyce Johnson's fine writing which fills in the spaces between letters.The writing is clear, poignant and nicely focused. There really wasn't a great depth to her relationship with Kerouac but that might be said of most of Kerouac's relationships. What is interesting here is the contrast in two lifestyles and how Joyce's perspective changed as a result of her relationship with Kerouac and the New York beat scene. It's interesting to see the quality of her writing evolve in her letters to Jack. This book takes one back into a space and time where it is easy to see how both writers were living beyond the margins-- before it became a cliche."
4,This A&M spare tire cover was a huge bargain in Dec '06 and is still good value now.,"I ordered this with a certain amount of trepidation because it was so much cheaper than any others I had seen elsewhere and I didn't know how it would look or fit. (It was an amazing price of about $11 back in late Dec '06.) However, I need not have worried, the cover is made of surprisingly thick, black vinyl and has a large maroon A&M; logo (with white hightlights) printed very clearly in the center of the main face. The cover has a drawstring that was strong enough for me to pull the cover really tight and get it nice and smooth around the tire. (Our spare tire is quite fat (an all terrain/mud type), but the cover covers it competely.)So, to sum up, this cover quality is good, specially for a 'universal fit' one, and I think it's a good deal, even at $30. (I would certainly have given this five stars if it was still only $11!)"
2,too soon broken,"New style easy-clean hinges... while a good idea, just didn't hold up. I'm male, 6' 190 lbs and it was broken within a month. Too bad... the butterfly pattern fit my wife's bathroom decore."
3,Gil's Mayfair review June 2012,We had to go online to purchase this toilet seat because we could no longer find it in any stores and we really liked our earlier ones. I would have given it 4 stars but one of the seats that we used (we bought these over 1 year ago I think) broke where the hooks at the back of the seat go into the toilet. The other one that is not used as much is doing fine. We love the padded seat feel and that is why we went that extra mile to find and buy the seat again. The butterly is a beautiful design (per my wife)and looks very elegant. We like the white but have seen it with the butterfly in multi-colors and it looks OK but not quite as classy. Good value for a good price.
5,Very comfortable & easy to install.,I've been using the product about two weeks and it seems to be durable. It's subtle butterfly design looks quite elegant.
4,I needed this,"What kind of a review can you write about a toilet seat? We recently did some remodeling on a workroom in our garage that had a shower and sink in it. We added a toilet and it has come in handy when one is out working in the yard and you need to go...no running thru the house with dirty shoes. The plumber put in a cheap seat and since this is used often in the summer now, I wanted something with a bit more class. I got this from warehouse deals and it arrived quickly and my hesitant husband did put the seat on even though it has the butterfly on it...it looks nice, it is much softer than the other cheap plumber seat...what can I say? I do like it."
2,it is a VERY VERY BAD BOOK,The only saving thing about this book is that it is written by david/leigh eddings.After 13 books in the series it is getting boreing.This book is just everything in the other books without one thing it is not a story. I salute the eddings couple for trying to milk money out of the belgaraid but enough is enough
5,Perfect Accompaniment to any Eddings Collection,The Rivan Codex helped to pull the whole two series (the Mallorean and the Belgariad) together. It was interesting ang it made the characters and the cultures come alive. I was particlarly fascinated by the two most 'alien' cultures; the Marags and Nyissans. It posed a tantalising theory that other cultures could be viable. A poem in the shape of a snake? How cool is that?
4,A very good reference for role-playing in Eddings' world.,A good story? No. A good reference for those wanting to write their own fantasy literature? Yes. Definately a must-have for those interested in playing fantasy role-playing games in the world of the Belgariad.
2,Author's introduction is most interesting aspect of the book,"Eddings' introduction is the reason to buy this book. He seemingly admits that the 12-volumes of the Belgeriad and Mallorean were stretched from a planned three books, and that all the ""hooks"" appeared in the first book. This does help explain the repetitive nature of his works. And oddly, he attacks Tolkien, who created the genre which allows Eddings to earn his living. Perhaps his attitude is explained by the fact that Tolkien was a professor at Oxford and Cambridge, while Eddings claims to have abandoned a teaching position over the lack of a raise, in order to resume his career in middle age as a box boy at a grocery store. Very odd."
1,"Borish, pedantic nonsense!! DO NOT BUY!!!","David Eddings is easily one of the best living fantasy authors around, but this is ridiculous. The Rivan Codex is far too detailed to be enjoyable, and it serves only to recount and clarify aformentioned events that Eddings has already written ENOUGH about. Die-hard Eddings fans want NEW material, not old stories retold!"
3,half good - litterally,"I'm a big fan of David and Leigh Eddings, and I've read most of their books twice and more, but when I bought this one I was severely disappointed - from the minute I read the idea behind the book I started having second thoughts, but as a fan I bought it, started reading and was hooked... most of the begining, some of the himns books and the first two or three Dals books are great, but after a while I got tired of it - the dals books are a repitition of each other, when each added a little new event (which is great, but after the third it's annoying), and the religious books are mostly boring (that's the bad half). as a hooked I was realy disappointed, and considered giving it even less, although it had some good parts. if you want a good book of them try Polgara the sorceress, this one is only for the realy realy hooked."
1,FLASH: Jerk Milks His Fans,"Clue Mr. Eddings: These collections are meant to be published after you are DEAD...but milking your loyal fans for this trash seemed better for your wallet, eh?Eddings wrote a semi-okay fantasy series that many love - good for him. Like Terry Brooks, he latched onto a genre with a somewhat small but incredibly loyal following and milked it for all it was worth. He was successful...and it all went to his head.Go to your local library and read this introduction. And then defecate on this lousy excuse to chop down trees. The sheer arrogance of this man is astounding, as is the superior tone that runs throughout most of this. Garbage through and through, only Eddings-stroking dimwits need apply."
5,I loved it!,"Hey, if you don't like David Eddings attitude, then you don't have to read the book, and you certainly don't need to trash him like that. I loved this book and all the detailed background information it provides. It all makes Garion's world seem more real, and it's fascinating."
2,Disappointing.,A major disappointment. Especially if one was expecting something in the likes of 'Belgarath' and 'Polaga'.However taken into context that these were all his 'pre'-notes to writing the Belgariad and the Mallorean it does give an intersting insight as to how he came up with his concepts for both sagas.A must buy for Eddings collectors and 'wannabe' fantasy writhers. For the causal reader- give it a miss.
4,"Not a new story, but very interesting","I really enjoyed this book; it was very informative and all that material (especially the Holy Books and histories) really made some things clear to me that didn't really come out in the Belgariad and the Mallorean.However, this is obviously NOT a story. It wasn't intended as a story, just a sort of compilation of all of the things that put the stories together. I'd only recommend this to people who have at least read the Belgariad in it's entirety, if not the Mallorean as well. But then, hey, who's picked up the Edding's series and put it down before the end?"
4,Intricate but no real punch to it,I liked the detailization of the storylines.....but not the lack of flair and style.
4,Remarkable,"I was fascinated by this book. Having read the series many times, I felt that this book served a scholarly function. First, as an interesting introduction to the art and artistry of the authors' procedure, the ""personal"" chapters are interesting and informative. Second, the background content is fascinating if one is quite familiar with the Eddings' work. I was pleased to read of the corollaries and appreciation of Medieval Romantic Literature. I highly recommend this work if, and only if, the future reader has read the series (perhaps more than once), and has a genuine interest in how the authors work."
3,A valuable addition for fans of the Belgrad/Mallorean,"""The Rivan Codex"" is a must-have for dedicated fans of David and Leigh Eddings, because it describes the creative process that went into the making of this incredible world. I throughly enjoyed the detailed descriptions of the various races and finding out who their real-world correspondents are. However, If you're only a casual reader of Eddings you probably won't get much of this, because it's more of a textbook in a way of what goes into creating a fantasy world, then a novel. But if you're into Eddings it's a must."
