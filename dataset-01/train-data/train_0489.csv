1,DISAPPOINTED,I BELIEVED THE DESCRIPTION AND WAS SAD WHEN THE EARRINGS ARRIVED. STONES SO SMALL THEY RESEMBLED SAND. COULDN'T TELL WITH MAGNIFYING GLASS WHAT COLOR SAPPHIRES WERE; THEY LOOKED MORE GREEN THAN BLUE.
3,Runs the gamut,"Collum's story is very well done. I have not read her before, but I may now. Excellent, well-drawn, multidimensional charcters; a plot that maintains the reader's interest; good deviations from the usual romance elements and good use of old standards. Very enjoyable. A solid 4 stars, maybe a bit more.The second story (Hinshaw's) is deplorable. I was barely able to get through it. This is some of the worst writing it has ever been my misfortune to encounter. I have read lots of fan fiction that's much better. Giving it even one star would be overly generous.Raleigh's contribution is middle of the road. There's a lot of interesting byplay between the characters, but some of Charlotte's actions nearly make her unworthy as a heroine. Marlow is pretty standard fare. Marlow's friend Henry is a great secondary character; he doesn't appear all that often, but he always makes an impression. 3 stars."
1,Not much of a cleaner,I've been looking for a good cleaner for exterior vinyl siding that is eco-friendly. This is not it. Tried it at 5 times the recommended strength and it still didn't do much.
4,Interesting Book,"This book is a good guide to understanding Judaism in that it explains the prophets, who they are, what motivated them, what they did, and their message. The book is small with text that is easy to read. The subject matter and because this book is thought provoking, the book takes a long time to slog through. It's well worth the time and effort.This book is also a good guide for Christians seeking to better understand the Old Testament."
4,One of the best Amicus compendiums.,"Seldom-shown in the U.K., this is one of the best of the Amicus compendiums. All the usual players present, rather dated, but splendid anyway. Not available on video....oh well."
2,The House That Dripped Boredom.,"I just finished watching this last night and all I can say is HoHum. Some wonderfull actors are wasted in this quadrilogy that only takes the time to present the scant hint of a delightfull macarbe plot only to quickly rap it up with endings that didnt have any twists or ""wow, didnt expect that? kind of ending.Im surprised that the most excellent performers Lee, Cushing ,and Elliot gave their time to this coulda been made for tv movie.If anybody remembers the ""Tales From the Crypt, Asylum, Vault of Horror"" movies that came out of this period of early 1970 you will have some creepy scary viginettes to compare this movie to and it will come out lacking.This house ought to be condemned."
2,Made In China = cheap price = cheap product,"Rough finish quality, they use an extremely soft wood that you can score even with your fingernail. I think after a year of use in the kids' closets, these would look like trash. Imperfections in wood filled with putty that doesn't stain and blend with the wood. Even cross slats are often not parallel with each other! Side panels are often warped making drawer operation (if you plan on using drawers) very difficult.Hardware quality varies from mediocre to abysmal: screw heads missing screwdriver slots, brackets that are rusty coming out of the plastic bag.Packaging is also very substandard, CHECK PACKAGE FOR DAMAGE BEFORE ACCEPTING FROM UPS!!! Small divots in the outer box translates to broken or cracked wood inside."
4,Good product,"Not much to say here, these work well and are solidly constructed. They include all necessary hardware. My only complaint is the price."
3,Overpriced,"So they use the Razor and Blades business model here. You buy the big John Louis closet system with many parts for a pretty good deal. Then you realize you need two more shelves and they charge you $54 for two! That's crazy. Looking back, I should have bought a circular saw to just cut some of the spare shelving from my closet system to make my own shelves. They work fine but the price is really too high."
3,well done!,"I am originally from Belgium and wanted, not without some pride, comment on the American release of Daens. Belgium is not a ""great"" film land, but now and then they produce a modest gem. To the viewer from Columbus, Ohio (if it's not a joke) I must correct you: the movie does not depict life in Berlin, but in 19th century Aalst, Belgium. Big difference. In Belgium the movie was loved, but, for some reason, Belgians are so critical and unappreciative of their own talents, it makes me sick. Stijn Coninx did a terrific job! Some other great films from Belgium are ""Toto le Hero"" and ""Man Bites Dog"" (English title)."
5,A snapshot of a great culture,"I first saw this film in 1997 when I was an exchange student in Belgie. It touched me then as a snapshot of a hardworking ever resilient culture of the Flemish. I tried finding here in the US when I came back but it was still priced at over a hundred dollars. Several years later I'm ecstatic to find the film not only available, but affordable. The Flemmish are an amazing people and this is a film of overcoming struggle."
4,A terrific film depicting life in Berlin in the late 1800's,I watch this film as part of a school assignment at Ohio State University. It is an excellent film depicting life in Berlin in the late 19th century. I was moved by the conditions that the children had to live and work in.
3,Should have been better,"Ted Hughes left out a number of Plath's poems--even a few she was particularly fond of. And he includes a separate section on her juvenilia, making it difficult to follow her development as a poet from her earliest to her last phases without jumping back and forth between different sections of the book. His notes are helpful but sometimes oblique. At least one important poem (from a biographical perspective) he relegates to his notes."
1,Terrible,"These are hard to get on the dog's feet - they're hard to get adjusted, and they will not stay on! If he steps in just a few inches of powdery snow, the bootie comes off. The velcro straps are not secured to the bootie, so if the dog steps on an unraveling end, the whole bootie comes off - then you may lose the bootie AND the strap! I'm still looking for a better alternative, but havent come up with one yet."
4,excellent quality,Was very happy with quality and promptness of filling order. Am working in on using it with our dog. She is timid and we are first using them when she is playing on icy snow.
4,Jealous Wives,"New home with new neighbors is the setting of Carolyn G. Hart's DEADLY VALENTINE.Annie and Max attend a Valentine's day party given by Sydney Cahill because Max's mother accepted for them. Sydney has a bad habit of attaching herself to other women's husbands and collects a hoard of jealous wives in the wake of her behavior. By the end of the party Sydney is dead and the field of suspects is limited to those who attended the party.Like all the Death on Demand mystery novels the pages are filled with references to crime novels and Laura's mental gymnastics. A good read is number 6 in this delightful cozy series with its memorable cast of characters.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
1,Excellent Film...Terrible Transfer,"Unfortunately there has yet to be a decent Region 1 transfer of this excellent film...But if you really want to own a copy I would give this version a miss in favour ofHistory at the Movies.The transfer is the same (as is the price), but at least you get the benefit of 12 other films, including 'Fire Over England' (1937) with Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh."
3,Heney VIII and his Six Wives,"I was just so happy to finally find this video after looking for it for a really long time It's not as good as the series, but if you are a big fan of the original BBC series you'll like it."
3,Okay,"Just a few days before her wedding to Barry Carson, Helen met his half-brother Morgan Fox-and on the day of the wedding itself she knew she could not go through with it. Whatever this feeling was between her and Morgan, it was something that had been lacking in her relationship with Barry, and she knew now that a marriage to him would be a disaster. So instead, she accepted Morgan's invitation to go back with him to Africa to look after his young daughter. But Morgan had not mentioned marriage and in fact he had made it clear that the job was all he was offering her. Was Helen making a complete fool of herself-or worse?"
2,Remember the classics!,"This work should be read as an update on Morton Fried's ""The Notion of the Tribe."" The authors do not give Fried enough credit but well read anthropologists will recognize that the key points stem from Fried. Read with caution as the two editors have never done long-term fieldwork among indigenous peoples."
5,My Favorite Saber Figure by Kotobukiya,"I have been a fan of the Type Moon characters for a while and Saber is my favorite so I may be a bit biased when it comes to her Figures. This figure is probably the best one made of her in this scale. It has very good detail; her face has such a good happy lively expression, the pose of her arms and legs show her sexy athletic nature without going too far, outfit is very cute and stylish, and it while it seems to be incongruous with her character for most of Fate Stay Night it lines up nicely with the Happy Saber portion of her character. I have this figure in a prominent placement close to the TV in my living room, and it tends to make me smile when I see it. Overall a great piece of Figure Artwork."
3,"Good, but not exceptional","Prince of Charming was an interesting romance about Robin Goodfellow, who had been trapped in a painting for a while. (This is in other reviews) It was your typical Magical Love Romance. While I enjoy the series, I haven't been bowled over by the quality of the stories. The romance was okay, but the characters weren't ones I'd jump up and down over. I did like the twist about how they were tied together. It made the story at least a bit more fun. The story was good, but again, it was very typical. There was nothing that made it stand out very much from any other fantasy/faerie romances. I liked it, but I wouldn't buy it again. It's a good read-from-the-library book, in my opinion."
5,A Dream Come True!,"Ever since Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer's Night's Dream"", I have been an avid admirer of Robin Goodfellow. This book brings him to life in a way that only women can really appreciate. The heroine in the book is just an ordinary woman, not of supermodel material, who has problems that are realistic, and Robin ""courts"" her in such a way that all women wish men would treat them. I look forward to the sequel to this novel with great anticipation, as I could not put this book down for a minute."
3,Cute and Fluffy,"Not the deepest romance ever written, but it is funny and the characters are fun. I also enjoyed the fact that her heroine was not built like a runway model and actually had a job that was a real job, not a daydream on tax-return day."
4,This was a fun book to read and look up paintings for,I enjoyed reading this book and looked up several paintings as I went along. At the end of the book she mentions the artist of the Robin Goodfellow painting as being Thomas Gainsborough. So I looked him up and found a gorgeous painting of a man that fit the description in the book which was fun since the cover model on the book really didn't do the character justice. I do want to check out the book she mentions at the end Things that never were though to find the picture that inspired her to write such a whimsical novel.
4,A feel good read,"Well, this definately was a happy book! I read this in about one sitting, cause I just couldn't put it down. By the end it was so worth it, the book just makes you go ""awww, that was nice"". Now, this book was great because of the characters, the plot, the writing, and lots of other stuff. The book was definately romance too, not just sex, though there was that. Robin and Kate like each other, and after being friends for a while, discover they love each other's personalities, as well as the physical parts. I loved how Robin treated Kate as an equal... and Kate was just awesome. I loved how after the initial sex Kate teases and initiates the next round, and Robin was like, that was so sweet, I've never had a woman do that for me. That was the basis of the relationship. They were so good together. Basically this was a feel good book. Robin kept trying to get Kate to trust him and trust herself and know that she was beautiful the way she was. And he loved her for being her."
4,Great realistic looking plants,"The title pretty much says it all, much better looking than the plastic plants, the only problem i've had with a few of these is the stems coming unglued from their base. Some aquarium silicon and they're fixed."
5,Love it,I love the padding and the tacky feel that prevents slipping. It's very easy to put on as well. This is my favorite grip.
2,Not so great...,"Not nearly as efficient as I had hoped. This is an upgrade from my last electric pencil sharpener.As a band director, we always need a good supply of sharpened pencils. Unfortunately this Stanley does not make the grade - very slow to get a point on a new pencil, sometimes over a minute. Does not sharpen evenly around the entire circumference.Guess I'll keep looking."
1,The WORST romance book I have ever read!!!!,"This was, by far, the worst romance I have ever had to suffer through reading. There was absolutely no plot, and an overabundance of graphic sex. The characters are flat and driven by only one thought--satisfying thier overactive hormones. By the end of the book, I didn't care what became of the characters, wishing that the heroine had not survived the shipwreck. Not even worth touching. I would have given it a negative score if I could have."
5,Great way to walk two dogs.,I walk my Flatcoat and Hound with this. The hardware is very robust. I could not find one as good as this locally. The pride is right.
3,"Nice for walking 2 dogs, poor quality","I like the idea of a split leash so I only have to hold one leash instead of two. I was really disappointed that after 3 uses, the stitching in the end of the leash (the loop that you put your hand through) came undone- mid walk! So instead of being able to put my hand through the loop, I had to grip the end of the leash against 130 lbs of dog on the other end. I plan to reinforce the stitching and hopefully it will hold. It does help also that the loop has some extra padding in it so it doesn't hurt your wrist."
5,Great product!,"I hesitated buying this for a long time, because I thought it might be too heavy for my Miniature Schnauzers, who weigh around 13 to 14 lbs. I needed something with a swivel, because they were getting tangled together when I walked them, and my hands were getting caught as well. I am thrilled with this product. It has totally solved my problem, and I really like the clips that attach to their collars, as they are very easy to clip on. The dogs walk beautifully together, and it has made walking them a real pleasure. I would have to agree with other reviewers, that I would not purchase this for toy sized dogs, as it may be too large or heavy for the tiniest dogs."
5,Great double dog leash!,This leash is great for taking 2 dogs on a walk together. I am a dog sitter and frequently have several dogs at my house and this makes it so much easier to take several of them on a walk together.
4,Good Leash for Dogs,"I bought this leash for my mother, who is 71. She has two pekingese's and had been tripped by them twice when trying to walk them on two different leashes. This leash is great for taking the dogs on a walk. However, she's found that when she takes them out to do their business, it's better to still take them out separately because when they were on this double leash, they kept bothering/interrupting each other. However, this is still a good, sturdy leash w/ a great cushioned handle."
1,Double Dog Leash,"Regrettably, this leash was useless for me. I have two Pugs, and this leash simply doesn't allow one dog to move faster than the other (which is the case with my dogs). It didn't occur to me when I purchased the leash, that there is no accommodation for dogs who travel at different rates, and this leash does not work in that situation."
2,Not for Pullers!,"I own two huskies, who walk fairly well on a leash. I thought this item would make it alot easier for me to walk the two together, but I was wrong. The clip that does the adjustment of the lenght isn't strong enough. It was constantly allowing slippage and the lenght that I had set between the two dogs was becoming larger. I would not recommend this item for dogs over 50 pounds that like to have a tight lead. My dogs don't drag me down the street, but they aren't the greatest walkers either, and this just plain didn't work for them."
1,Disappointed,"The clasp to adjust the lengths of the two leads SLIPS AND DOES NOT HOLD WHERE YOU SET IT. I thought the quality of the product was excellent though with very strong lobster claw hookups, etc. BUT, Everytime I set the leash lengths shorter for one dog and longer for the other, if one of the dogs pulled the least little bit, the slider clasp wouldn't hold where it was supposed to, where I had set it."
5,good quality,This leash worked out great the padding in the handle is super comfortable and the clasps are heavy duty. It has no problems with two german shepherds and the adjustableness is super easy to work out
2,It works,"Okay. The tandem leash works, but I'm not a huge fan. I find it easier to pack walk the dogs without it. Just not for me. God forbid your dogs get into a lamppost or pole tiff. Mine don't on regular leash, but what can I say, they aren't tandem dogs."
4,great leash,"my dogs are so strong and active, i had a hard time walking them. But this leash is pretty good. My dogs are both medium sized dogs, so I like that you can adjust the leash so that one gets more slack than the other."
3,Hard to handle,I liked the idea but it is really hard to handle. I liked the color and it is well made but not so easy to use.
2,Other reviewers we right...,"I hate to say ""you get what you pay for"", but it's true in this case. I felt like the price was so great that I had nothing to lose, except I have yet another leash that I cannot use. The mechanism for locking the leash into a certain size opens the minute the dogs start walking. Other reviewers said they altered it themselves to make it stay, but I""m going to just return mine. The handle is nicely padded, the webbing seems also fairly durable, however the lack of stretch/shock absorption in the material makes it actually harder to walk 2 dogs of any size/strength/enthusiasm."
2,Double dog leash,I have two small puppies and one larger dog. Three leashes was a little much with all the tangling so I bought the double leash for the pups. I was not very happy with it. It still tangles just as if I had separate leashes. The only good thing is I don't have to hold three handles. I have purchased a better one I found in a catalog that actually spins at the handle to prevent tangling. I'm looking forward to receiving it.
4,Great idea,Came before date quoted. Sturdy and exactly as described. Definitely well made. Takes the dogs some getting used to - walking so close but that doesn't have to do with the leash quality. Need to practice where to place the slider for the length of each dog.
3,Playwrights BEWARE!!!,"Just as my title states the 2005 Writers Market neglects playwriting. I bought this book because I had owned the 2003 version. The 2003 version helped me develop great relationships with theaters all over our country. This is due to the creators of the 2003 version actually paying as much attention to finding out submission details as they did for other types of writers(fiction, non-fiction, short story, etc...) Unfortunately, that effort has been abandoned in this 2005 version. (I do not know about the 2004 version.) There is a little information about playwriting contests, but no information about submission policies for theaters(as previously printed in the 2003 version). What happened? It is bad enough that playwrights don't get enough respect in the literary world and now we are being shunned farther into the literary corner. If you are a playwright, this book will not help you any better than doing the google-ing yourself."
4,Great Expose for Writers,"I came across this book many years ago, ever since I have been yearning to have my own copy due to the enormous information packed in the book for writers.One of it amazing features is that it gives minute details of publishers and what they expect from writers. Whichever aspect of writing you want to concentrate upon, this book will give you a lead.Olagunju, Lagos Nigeria"
1,No stars should be an option,"I'm a fan of RPG's, and have played even some poor ones through to completion. That said, I've had root canals that were more fun than this. The game tries to combine genres and, as usual with that attempt, does nothing well. The game looks promising at the character creation screen, but goes rapidly downhill thereafter. The character plods (running, the usual default, is difficult to achieve), switches weapons with no reason, and the combat is hard to control. The map is dreadful. Village management is a pain. Henchmen seem impossible to obtain in the beginning game, and there is no ramp-up in battle. Possibly the game improves in later stages, I have no idea, I gave up. Save your money and buy Sacred."
2,A disappointment,"I usually wear a U.S. size 10 (European 41) and I trusted the description that said a U.K. size 8 would fit me. It doesn't. Too big. My foot was sliding around and the drawstring was not able to create the snug fit I expected. Also, the sole of the Cactus slip-on may be Arche rubber, but it doesn't have the springy quality I have loved in previous Arche shoes. Maybe shoes are something that can't be bought reliably over the Internet."
4,forgotten jewel,"I'm on the road in Kuala Lumpur today and just heard about Whitney Houston's untimely death. And the first thing I thought of was: I need to go back and listen to the really funky Material album that she sang on, which of course is the one here. Very, very solid collection of songs, more funky and dance-oriented than other Material albums, but I ain't complaining. I consider ""Seven Souls"" to be the best Material album, but this is a close second in my book. The grooves on here are outstanding! And young Whitney sings her heart out too."
3,Could have been so much better....,"The absence of a change of tempo really brings this material down. I expected so much more given the nice stable of singers that were enlisted. It is sometimes hard to distinguish one tune from the next, and the substantial punch that is present in most other Laswell works is missing as well. To hear this approach done much better, try the CD ""Soft Machine"" by the Teddybears."
2,No flute part!,"This is an unedited version of the sonatas, which some may want but it does not come with a seperate flute part and basso continuo part."
3,Basic Theological Introduction,"This is a good, basic, introduction to Orthodoxy, written for those who do not necessarily have a firm grasp of the Christian tradition. It is NOT, however, a basic introduction for those who have a grasp of the Christian tradition, who are perhaps active members of the Catholic or Mainline Protestant traditions. What this work does nicely is give a general run down of some very basic Christian ideas, albeit all from the standpoint of Orthodoxy. For someone who is looking for what is the unique Orthodox contribution or understanding, the work does not go into great depths. Consider this a nice, familiar friend, not the reference book for the arcane or technical."
3,Rick returns to his roots,"This live show recorded in The Aladdin's Bagdad Showroom in (early?) 1979 was shortly after Rick started doing his oldies as a big part of his stage shows again. In addition to the ""usual"", he does ""Last Time Around"" (from RUDY THE FIFTH), ""Mystery Train"" (from BRIGHT LIGHTS & COUNTRY MUSIC). The most improvizational bit comes when he momentarily slips into a very blues-sounding ""Merry Christmas Baby"". It's both a moody & funny moment, and having been to dozens of ""bar shows"" it's something I can appreciate. The same goes for the sound quality, which isn't the greatest-- but had I been there that night, personal tape recorder in hand, I'd have a treasured memory to hold onto-- and this CD is WAY better than that! Of course, for those who only want high-quality in their live albums, seek out RICK NELSON IN CONCERT (1969) and LIVE, 1983-1985."
3,another in the struggle for ultimate survival!,"There is something about this series that makes you wanting to read the next one! Will rourke find his family? Will Rourke fall for the russian woman Natalia? I certainly would! The action is furious and almost non-stop. Sarah, Rourke's wife is a good female character that develops throughout this series becoming a warrior/survivalist in her own right. This is a fun read if you are into post-nuclear ravaged America novels like I am."
4,Delightful!!,"I think this movie was very good. It is an unusual twist on the classic story and a great movie for children. When I was younger I watched it over and over again until it broke! I am going to buy another one though because it is so special to me, and I just love it."
4,"Great video, except for some unecessary namecalling.","I was so happy to finally find and buy this movie on Amazon! I had a copy a long time ago, but it got lost. It brought back a lot of memories. It is a funny, lively, and musical movie that I have adored for years. I still love it as much as I used to, however, I noticed something I didn't notice when I was young. Fraulein Rottenmier really puts down Heidi A LOT in the movie and calls her things like ""a nothing"" and ""a zero."" She even sings a song about it. I find that very hurtful to watch sometimes. That is the only negative thing about this movie, the rest is really quite pleasant. I guess it is just a judgement call on whether young children should watch it unless they know enough not to call others those same names and be rude and hateful like Fraulein. Maybe since I didn't notice it that much, maybe other children may not either."
4,A Good Show,"I remember seeing this movie in the mid 80's in elementary school. I really liked it back then, and for years tried to track down a copy of it. Recently I found it here on Amazon, and couldn't click to buy it fast enough. While being slightly different than what I remembered it when I saw it before, it is still a very good movie."
2,Cheap...,"I've had a wrist issue for years, and in the past I had a different (and much better) wrist brace. I was hoping this would be a replacement, but it is simply cheap and uncomfortable. Yes, it braced my wrist, but it hurt with any prolonged wear period. I returned it and bought the one I needed (made by OTC) that is much higher quality and aligns my wrist properly."
1,Poor Design,"I found this wrist splint to be of poor designand low quality materials. It didn't help myCT at all. There is almost no padding and theneoprene is a little stiff and makes youwant to itch. There are much better wristsplints for the same price or less. The oneI have currently has very nice padding and iswell designed with very nice materials, and Ionly payed 14.00 for it."
3,"Product OK, Company, the Pits","Since the sizes were wrong, I wanted to return this product but the company did not respond to my request for a mailing label."
5,You Must Read It,Quite possibly the finest novel ever written. There is nit doubt it is the best love story I have ever read. You will never forget the ending!
5,"This is a deeply moving work, one of Solzenhitsyn's best.","Having read a good bit of Solzhenitsyn's books, I can safely say that this is the pinnacle of his work. It simultaneously examines how people cope with the loss of freedom (to the Soviet state and the cancer ward), with the death that surrounds them, and with their own mortality. Through the whole work, too, through death and triumph over disease, runs Solzhenitsyn's recurring theme of the survival and growth of the human spirit under terrible conditions, seen as the main character and those around him realize former errors and deficiencies of character and seek to redeem themselves by doing good for others. I would highly recommend this book to all readers of Solzhenitsyn and, really, anyone."
3,Not one of Solzhenitsyn's best,"This book, however good of a book it is, has potential to be so much better IF THE STORY DID NOT FALL APART FOR ALMOST EVERY CHARACTER BUT ONE IN THE LAST 100 PAGES! This is the last of Solzhenitsyn's I would pick to read."
5,READ THIS BOOK!,"Actually i have nothing to add about the book in general. The people before me describe it very well, i think. I just would like to say that i would read this book a second time just for the scene where all the patients are involved in a discussion regarding one of Tolstoy's stories, ""what men live by"". It's just wonderful, all these people with different backgrounds comment on the title of the story, none of them actually read it; they just argue on the title. I don't want to spoil the scene here, so read it yourselves, it's worth it."
4,Delicious Reading,"The reason i call this ""delicious,"" is because the writing is so fantastic, wonderful, beautiful, awesome... that you can feel, taste, smell, see everything you are reading. Reading a book like this makes you feel blessed that you HAVE EYES.I'm an AVID reader, and this book is really special. the only reason i couldnt give it the full amount of Stars is because of the names in the story...ugh! Maybe it's because of my age or meds i'm on, but with the Russian names being two names, and then also some kind of first name... i was very confused. I wish the author or translator could have just used ONE name for each character... and stuck with it. I know that's not how it's done - lol - but it would have made it so much easier for me to follow the story. I had to keep going back to try to figure out who was who, with which illness. It was well worth it, though."
1,Pages Missing - what a waste of money,"What a waste of pulp.I ordered this book as a used paperback. When it came, it had about 20 pages torn out completely, near the end of the book. But it might as well have had all the pages torn out-- by the time I read 3/4 through Glover's so-called ""proof"" of the case against Jack Hyles, I was convinced that he has severe mental reasoning ability. It's a wonder he ever got his law license at all.Circular logic, circumstantial evidence & hearsay from Glover's friends-- these are the tools Glover uses to ""expose"" Jack Hyles.Glover specializes in Western Fiction. Readers of this book will find that he specializes in Christian Fiction as well. From bizzare conspiracies to ""secret meetings"", this author makes it clear to me that someone ought to write a book called ""Fundamentally nuts: The Voyle Glover Case""."
1,Far fetched,"Poor writing, poor documenting, and terrible philosophy. The writer is out to seek revenge for some sort of personal attack or by having his feeling hurt."
1,A book full of fiction and not fact!,I dare Mr. Glover to prove his words. This is a slander of a good man for the gain of Mr Glover. Its ashamed that books like this are allowed to be printed. Not only does this book attack Jack Hyles but it also attacks every man or woman that tries to do right and as a result pays a price for the popularity that comes their way. I dare Mr. Glover to prove what he writes!!
1,Voyle Glover's sad attempt at fame,"How do you go from being an obscure, disgruntled, bitter church member to being a ""superstar"" author? Simple. Just attack America's greatest soul-winning pastor with lies, distortions and gossip!At least that's what Mr. Glover has tried to do. Fortunately, it did not work. Glover's hate-filled attitude towards strong men of God is laid bare for all to see.Honest people who read this book will see right through Mr. Glover's anti-fundamentalist agenda."
1,Wow is this book misleading,"This book is misleading as can be. Lack of documentation, some sort of personal grudge is very apparent and a hateful attitude is scattered throughout this book.First time I read it, I wanted to stick a needle in my eye. What a waste of an evening."
1,This Book is Trash!,"Jack Hyles was a great spirit filled man of God, this book is garbage and part of a well planned smear campaign using lies and proganda."
4,An Opening of the Eyes,"I read this book several years ago because even as a graduate of Hyles-Anderson, I was not afraid to investigate for myself. The author was very responsible in his presentation of the facts. I had sat under much of the preaching that the author had evaluated - his analysis was fair and accurate. Its hard to recognize hard facts when you fall under the influence of a man as strong a manipulator as Dr. Hyles was, but realizing the truth is so freeing. I highly recomend this book to those who have attended this college and are ready to make Jesus Christ the sole satisfier of your soul, not an icon. Dr. Hyles called my husband and myself the greatest alumni (financial gifts)supporters (at that time) of his church. So its not like we have ever been out to harm Pastor Hyles in any way."
1,Ugh...,"I have set myself a goal. I want to see every episode of the Original Series. I feared ""The Way to Eden"" would be a clunker because I saw a review giving the show ZERO stars. But still, I went in, loyaly, though not expecting much. I'm sorry to say I came away agreeing with that review. There are about ten million things wrong with this episode. I honestly believe they could make all the faults in this story a category on ""Jeopardy."" For starters, Chekov is just way off. The Hippies are incredibly goofy--both in concept and in execution. And this ""Eden"" planet that they're looking for, what is it supposed to be? I just don't know. There is nothing in this worth seeing. I am pleased, however, that while trying to accomplish my goal, I ran into episodes FAR superior to this one."
3,Charles napier rules as a wacked out space hippie in this 1.,This is a strange episode with Charlie Napier and Spock providing us a look at the future of pop music. Not the best episode of Star Trek.
1,Peace brothers!,"Space hippies! That's a new concept. Don't see this one, there's really no point in it. Spock's jam session is a headache and Adam's constant singing is enough to make you turn it off within seconds. Take my advice, stay away."
4,Good and promptly delivery,good product and on time delivery. The quality of the video is not very good as expected. But it helps for setting up color fish finder.
5,Interesting Alternative,"This book is just so neat! It can be used as a toy or decoration! The book opens to form a circle with a lot of the Hogwarts rooms featured in GREAT DETAIL. It's an interesting alternative to reading all about Harry Potter and Hogwarts School, you can actually see another visual representation of what J.K. Rowling invented. It would make a great/unique present for the Harry Potter fan in your life."
4,"An evocative, haunting, and memorable soundtrack.","This is one of the most beautiful soundtracks that I own, and definitely the most different! While modern US soundtrack composers usually take one theme and run with it, Geinoh Yamashirogumi has created an immense panorama of musical landscapes that invite the mind to wander. While some tracks are somewhat difficult to listen to at first (Illusion, Dolls Polyphony), others reach out and grab you immediately (Kaneda, Tetsuo, and Requiem). Strongly suggested because it also gives insight to the unique Japanese way of looking at music. It's worth five stars to me, but I realize that an album that isn't 100% good doesn't meet that criteria. The rest makes up for it, though. Give it a try."
3,Inside Out,"This book is ok because it tells about what had happened in 1968. The main character, Cherie serenely doesn't act as if she is thirteen. She gets afraid of the dark and still plays with dolls. No one I who is thirteen is like that. Perfect for girls ages nine and up.This book is about a girl named Cherie and her family. Cherie is a normal girl, she rides bike, goes to school, and has friends. Then one day when she gets the job to deliver the newspaper and everything changes. The news gets worse and worse everyday. Then one day a girl just like Cherie goes missing and Cherie thinks that might happen to her. She cries more and more about it. On top of all this news, her mom is having a baby and her family is going to move.Will the news ever get better? Where will her family move too? Will her new family member be a boy or a girl? reading ""Outside In"" will help."
1,"Horrible, no plot whatsoever, disapointing read","This was possibly the worst book I've ever read, simply because there was no plot. It's 192 pages of nothing. The main character, a young girl named Cherie, seems to express few or no emotions throughout the book, mainly, it seems to be, because not much happens. All the characters seem two-dimensional, with no personality of their own. When her close neighbours move, she seems confused about her emotions relating to their son, and never really seems to resolve those either. At best, don't buy it, and at worst, check it out from a library."
2,Ripoffs Abound,"There are some great riffs in this one. Unfortunately, most of them were lifted from better songs by better bands. Compare ""Red Lite, Green Lite, TNT"" with Zeppelin's ""Communication Breakdown"". ""She Dropped Me the Bomb"" cops AC/DC's ""If You Want Blood"". The title track ""borrows"" Cinderella's ""Shake Me"". Etc, etc, etc.If you can get past this stuff, it's a fairly decent rock record. Whiteman's voice can get irritating after a while, but the twin guitars have a nice AC/DC-meets-Thin Lizzy sound about them, and there isn't too much posturing going on (unlike most bands of the era)."
5,Kix Rox!,"In my opinion this is one of the greatest hard rock albums of all time. You can put it in and listen to it from begining to end, the songs are just to good to skip. You my not know most of these songs but they are worth a listen. I would call this one a must have for a hard rock fan of any era. Kix, we need you guys to get back together and help bring straight ahead rock'n'roll back to the forefront."
4,classic metal is fun,"Cheesy, but yet cool and fun. Solid effort from 1-hit metal 80's dudes, KIX. worht buying on the cheap used price. Rock on Dudes."
3,Just alright,"I thought maybe the sheets would be ""nicer"" ... they're flimsy and bland, although they fit well. For some reason I was just expecting ""more""? Very thin, although I'm sure they'll be fine for my son's Moses basket."
2,Missing Files to Download,The book seems to be well written but I cannot find the files that were to be available to download to do the excersises in this book.
4,dubbed-out jungle dance sensation,"Another gem from the Studio K7 label.If king tubby where to meet Roni Size it would sound something like this.Seamless mix of very dubbed-out R & B,reggae,soul and jungle.A must buy for the dance music fan"
2,Vinyl Version is Missing Songs,"There are only three records on the vinyl version, and the songs they take out are some of the best ones. That's pretty weak. The only song I wanted was Night Fall and they left it off. Don't buy it."
2,Snaking Through No Instructions,"The concept for this game is great for teaching kids word recognition. However, the game does not include ANY instructions as to how to play, leaving parents and kids guessing as to the rules. I would recommend the game if it came with instructions for play (like every other board game does) or even had instructions online that were easily found. I can't recommend it, though, because after searching for over half an hour, all I came up with were links to buy the game. I don't want to buy it; I just want instructions!!!"
5,Item is great for price,"Great item, exactly what I was looking for. Good quality and use it every few weeks as my carry on bag."
5,Perfect classic toy,"Can't wait to give this to my little boys for Xmas! My 5-y-o is into ""weapons"" and imaginative play, but too many kids' toys have pieces that get lost and broken. This one satisfies the sound-effect-craving with a ""POP!"" and a bullet that doesn't get lost--or put in toddlers' mouths. Yay!"
1,broke in 5 minutes,"This was a huge mistake, I bought 4, for my grandchildren and one was broke when they opened it and the other 3 broke shortly afterwards. What a shame since they had ask for a pop gun and I got this mess."
2,broke after about 2 shots,"this toy would have been great if it had not broke just after a couple of shots, could not be fixed the rubbe inside was defective"
4,Good fun!,"Bought this for my 4yr old's stocking. It's smaller than expected, but is a perfect size for little hands. Easy to use as well. Not too loud. String seems to be flimsy and will probably break off eventually. But good for it's purpose!"
2,Poor quality -- spend a bit more for a higher quality product,My son received this pop gun for his 6th birthday. He was so excited! But the dowel broke within the first few pumps. A big let down.
3,"Fun for my son, but noisy","My son absolutely loves this toy, and it does seem to work well. I suppose figuring out how it works is remotely educational. The popping noise is louder than I expected."
2,Slightly disappointed,"This pop gun was a lot smaller than I expected but I figured for the price, it was alright. We've only owned it about 8 months but 2 months ago it quit working. I'm not sure why but the cork does not POP out anymore like its supposed to. I know toys dont last forever, but I was pretty disappointed that it only worked for 6 months. The construction of it is very nice. Its all wooden and painted very well. Maybe we just a defective one?"
2,Norton wrote herself into a corner with this one,"She fell out of the magic tree and hit every evil branch on the way down. She has to foil a very positive character like Yonan, who is very unselfish, and will sacrifice all his interests for the good of the group, no matter how hopeless his task. Unfortunately the foil means 3 very unsympathetic women. Situation reads as hopeless as Dark Piper. Got the feel that the dark passage merely led to something darker. Very unlike Moon of 3 Rings whre the reluctant magic mess maker keeps trying to get things back in balance, and ends up being shipped off planet as the ship's cat. Ah well, the number #1 rule of Wtich World is that the ladies lose the magic when they mate. There are only 2 exceptions, higher powers interbreeding were riders, and magic starved earthlings."
5,deleted scenes,"Does anyone know if this product comes with deleted scenes? I bought How to Deal by itself & the dvd is useless as far as deleted scenes. At the time of its release, the company thought it would be a good idea to make you go online to watch them, by downloading Interactual media player. Interactual media player doesn't hold up well in 2011 & the website is gone! Just curious to know if this is the DVD edition I should buy or not."
5,Excellent read for amateur and scholar!,"I found this book to be very informative and interesting. Speaking strictly as an amateur Mayanist, with no college level education, the book captured my interest, and opened my eyes, to many things most people do not know about the Maya. This is a great read for anyone who has interest in the Maya of yesterday and today."
1,Worthless,What were they thinking? The materials make sense but the design does not. What was I thinking? For any very small dog there is no way they could work.
1,Worst product ever!,"Rigid and poorly designed. They should have an ""L"" shape to fit a dogs paw. These are straight and go on like a cast. Big waste of money and time now spent returning them to the store."
3,decent try,"Seems to be made of a durable material because mine have held up well and do a great job of protecting my dogs feet. But, they like to slide off at least one time every walk so the way they are held on could be designed better."
1,4 pieces of expensive mistake,"Our dog is very sensitive to salt. She couldn't walk around on saltedsurfaces. The Paw Tectors seemed to be a good solution.However, the shoes just fell of from her feet. We had to find them in the dark and cold night. And again. And again.The Paw Tectors produce a knocking noise on the sidewalk, similar to (but speedier than) the shoes of Fred Astaire. After two days of use one of them is already showing some wear.The product is nearly useless and for its quality it is expensive."
2,Not Again,"Why Why Why does Mrs. MacLean feel she must in every and I mean every book invent a hero who is so CRUEL. The first book I read by her was ""To Marry A Duke"" need I say more and now we have our current problem I don't mean that nicely. The descriptions she protrays of her heros are just down right horrible. Poor Lily scraps by in this (love) story for some ounce of love from husband and recieves none till then very end and it was just not convincing for me in the least. I did read the other reviews (I always do) and I can't understand at all why anyone would who reads romance would find it romantic for the hero in the book to be cruel and the heroine to have no backbone and just take what she gets. Would you? Please!I love romance novels, mystery, supsense novels but if I am reading a romance am I not supposed to feel that while I am reading it. This author seems to be failing me at every turn."
3,Something was missing...,"...from this book to make it truly romantic and emotional. Whilst I am a fan of unrequited love stories, and found Lily to be a somewhat engaging character, within her own book it seemed as though she was reduced to a doormat willing to do anything to get Whitby to notice her. While I am glad that the author refrained from throwing in another ""suitor""(who always ends up being EVIL!), there was a void between the protagonists that caused me to feel no sense of urgency between the relationship of Lily and Whitby--no reason that Whitby seeing Lily as a woman and returning her love would change his life for the better and he hers. In the end, Love According to Lily was merely a nice read. Nothing spectacular or emotional or heartrending, just an entertaining-for-the-moment read."
3,"Expected More, Got Less","Lily and Whitby were my favorite characters from MacLean's first novel, TO MARRY A DUKE, so I was highly anticipating LOVE ACCORDING TO LILY even before its release. This book, however, didn't live up to my expectations. Although the beginning started well, the story became flat and dull soon after. I was so disappointed! This story of unrequited love had so much potential. Yet it lacked the emotional intensity and passion I craved. I couldn't believe how Lily was transformed into such a whimpy and needy character. (She was so delightful in TO MARRY A DUKE). Also, I disliked how her love was so one-sided. Whitby did show genuine affection for Lily (treating her almost like a little sister). However, his love for her was never convincing. Although I have read only two MacLean novels, both have been total disappointments! Don't think I'll read another MacLean novel again."
2,"Sad, desperate Lily",I felt disgusted at Lily the whole time. If she had been a man and acted the way she did she would have been labled as creepy. No matter how many times he rejected her and told her NO she kept throwing herself at him and it was akward to read...until he gave in unsuprisingly when she gave herself to him. It seemed he only married her out of pity and the fact that he thought he was dying and she was ok with that! Desperate! Lily was just everything you don't want to be as a woman. I didn't even like Whitby very much. I couldn't finish this one.
4,Awesome book!,"This is by far the best of this series. I have read all but the Portrait of a Lover and the others were a little disappointing except the last one in the series about Martin, James' brother. I have to say I have never never cried so much over a book before. It was such a sad story. I have to agree that MacLean makes her heros very cruel to their ladies about giving them their love. I am able to look past that in this book since he is fighting the fact that she is his best friends sister. He does try and give her all that he can emotionally and she knew that going into the marriage. Very good read, need lots of tissues for this one!!!"
5,my favorite book,"I don't know how anyone can give this book a poor review. I absolutely love this book. It is so romantic and sweet. I am also glad there wasn't another suitor involved. Elenor's part wasn't very big so I don't count her. The love between the characters shines in the pages. Lily just is more vocal about hers, I feel like Whitby is trying so hard not to recognize these feelings he has because he is scared of losing her. Beautiful romance. It is definatley on my keeper shelf I have reread it many times!!"
1,GREAT STORY...EXTREMELY POOR QUALITY DVD,"This is a great story with wonderful characters and fine acting but the quality of the DVD is awful. There are scenes that are out of focus, fuzzy and choppy. Even for the great price, extremely poor quality."
2,lovely film; poor DVD quality,"Very enjoyable movie marred by washed out color. The Alps are breathtaking, but you wouldn't know it from this DVD.So, I give the movie itself 4 stars, and the DVD 1 star."
2,Where's Heidi's personality?,"Anyone who has read the book will look forward to a bright, inquisitive, chatty and charming little girl. I was very disappointed with this portrayal of that character. She didn't talk much, she didn't seem to have much personality at all. As far as following the story line, I understand they always have to make some adjustments for Hollywood, so I won't pass too harsh a judgement there. But when the main character of the story is bland, I just have to whine. Luckily there are other versions. I'll try another."
5,Great Learning Tool,"I think this is a wonderful game for working on coin identification and the basic principles of making change. My 5-year old daughter enjoys it. She is able to identify the coins and knows the value of each one. She is also able to count by tens and fives. However, she still needs help at times coming up with the correct change. It is a fun way to work on money skills without it being so rote."
5,Engaging way to learn about money!,"This is a great little game which can be played in different ways depending upon the age of your child. For the very young, just spinning the spinner and throwing the dice. For the three year old, it is a nice way to introduce coins and game playing. For the four year old, it is a good way to teach the value of coins and a good first game. For older children, the game can be played as directed, making it a challenging but engaging way to practice money skills. Highly recommended."
4,Cute Game,"This is a fun little game. My daughter is 6 and is learning to ""count change"". This is a good game to speed up the learning process."
3,Boring,"We've tried to get my daughter interested in this game, but it is just boring. It's cheaply made and uninteresting. Instead, we just have her practice counting out the change at the store and she's doing just fine. Spend your money elsewhere."
3,Money game,Great game to learn coin value etc but had Canadian money. Very disappointed. Found a replacement USA money to add to the game but made the purchase much more costly.
1,Canadian money,"This game contains Canadian vice American money. The product description says you will be shipped model LER5057. Even the picture shows American money. But what you get instead is LSP5057-C. The really annoying part? They use the box for model LER 5057 (including the instructions that pertain to the American version) and then slap a big purple sticker on the front that says, ""LSP5057-C Canadian Money Bags Game."" How nice. It was, of course, easy to initiate a return through Amazon. You might want to verify which version you're getting before placing your order."
5,A GREAT learning toy!,I purchased this game as a supplement to our math lessons. I homeschool two of my children (first grade and second grade). This coin value game is a wonderful addition to our regular lessons-I have even used it in place of our daily math lesson! The coins are quite realistic looking which makes it much easier to identify them properly. I do recommend this game if you're looking for a fun supplement to a routine math curriculum!
2,Candian Version??`,"Im guessing this game would be great for my 1st grader, according to the other reviews. But we're unable to play it correctly as we received the Canadian version and my 6 year old is already aware the money in the game looks very different from the money we've been using to teach coins up to this point. Disappointed."
2,Got the Canadian Version,"This game would be wonderful I think...except I was shipped the Canadian Money version. I returned that one and going to order again, hopefully I will get the American version. I planned on using this to help the developmentally disabled clients I support to learn basic money skills. It won't work well however if they do not recognize the money.I am hoping that Amazon picks up on the mass amount of returns for this item and contacts the company to let them know that they can't just substitute the Canadian Version! I am tempted to buy the item from someone else and pay the shipping charges in attempt to get the one that I want."
5,For Grandson,"The family has played it so much and the learning about paper money and coins has been very easy for the 6yr old and his 3yr old brother is doing fine. The one thing that would be nice is the money tray, the coins slip under the dividers. I have recommend this to another family so they to can help the child learn currency."
5,WONDERFUL BOOK & EXCELLENT SERVICE,"I ordered this book and another book on Dec 22nd, and it was on my porch early afternoon on Christmas Eve. I did not expect to get it that soon!This book makes everything so simple. Everytime you get a new computer, and it has a new operating system, you can't do much with it for a while. I was actually able to do things with this book explaining the steps.I was so impressed with it, I just ordered the author's 'Teach Yourself Visually Windows Vista' book. It is the first book to impress me for it's ease and userability.Back in the ""OLD"" days they use to supply books with computers that helped to explain how to do tasks...or at least the steps a new user shoukd go through to find the info on the computer. NOW ALL YOU CAN DO IS GUESS WHERE SOME USEABLE INFORMATION IS LOCATED, AND HOW TO GET TO IT.AN EXCELLENT SOURCE BOOK....THANK YOU!"
2,Not that helpful.,"Save your money, and buy The Missing Manual for Vista instead. You won't really use most of the material in Simplified Tips & Tricks, or it is so basic that you are paying $$ for nothing. As an example, there are some pages devoted to: ""Protect Your Contacts by creating a backup copy""...duh!!"
4,simple Vista,"Helps to understand the workings of Vista, especially handy after using XP for a long time."
3,Vista Tips & Tricks Simplified,"This book does give some good tips, however the average computer user does not need to know half of them. It also has a lot of pictures to go along with it to help a person understand."
2,Not for Dummies,"This book was the second one purchased because of it's name indicating it may be somewhat easy to understand. But, this is not a book for the uneducated or ""dummy"" senior."
4,An entertaining departure from the norm.....,"As a long-time fan of Mills, I bought this several years ago when it was first published. Having not even looked at the plot summary prior to ordering the book, I had expected one of Mills' more typical mystery thrillers. A bit surprised and perhaps somewhat disappointed, the book has been sitting on the shelf, never quite making it to the top of the ""to-be-read"" pile until very recently. In retrospect, I should have tackled Smoke Screen much sooner. This was a very quick, entertaining read. Mills presents a look at the tobacco industry that is at various times humorous, satirical and sarcastic. He pokes at tobacco companies, anti-smoking lobbyists, politicians, and tort lawyers, with all groups coming away flawed and compromised. Mills reminds us that with smoking, as with many other complex issues today, there are many sides to the situation and no easy solutions. All-in-all, Smoke Screen was an entertaining departure from Mills' more typical works."
3,A good read,"An interesting if perhaps unbelievable read. There is just enough possibility to be somewhat plausible. Laughed several times reading it. About the tobacco industry and the government and what happened when the tobacco industry shut down. Amazing thesis!J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,More fantasy than thriller,"More a fantasy than a thriller, this story was so engrossing I was more than half way through it before it occurred to me it wasn't really a mystery. You know Trevor is being set up as a patsy, but are fascinated to see the result. Although I was, occasionally, annoyed by Trevor's seeming spinelessness, his youth, relationship with his parents, and background allowed me to accept him. The relationship between the government, tobacco industry and legal system was fascinating. If you're looking for a book in which to lose yourself for a few hours, or the perfect airplane book, I recommend giving this a try."
4,What would happen if...?,"To be upfront, I'm a non-smoker. That said, this book was hilarious. What would happen if cigarettes suddenly disappeared from store shelves? Hmmm.... In real life something of that magnitude could never be coordinated successfully, but this is a book and we can do whatever we want in a book, right? Well, get ready for some fun. Nobody is left unscathed in this scenario. There is no good guy or bad guy. The tobacco companies, politicians and anti-tobacco lobbies all get skewered equally. The tangled web of tobacco politics will make your head spin and evoke more than a few chuckles."
2,Disappointing,After reading his earlier books this one was a real disappointment. The plotline was not very convincing. It appears that Mills has a contract to produce a book per year. This one felt forced. Stick with the earlier ones especially Sphere of Influence.
3,"Not structured, but some nice pieces","A collection of thoughts, insights, anecdotes, exercises and real life examples of applying creativity to business. If this is a structured approach, as the authors imply, the structure is hard to detect. However, the exercises are intriguing and the anecdotes are inspiring. Nice section on destroying the Voice of Judgment that shoots down creativity. I'm baffled by the other reviews that describe this as a ""new age"" or ""occult"" book. It is well-documented that creativity and intuition go hand-in-hand, but I guess this is just too esoteric an idea for most business people."
1,Little to do with creativity and much to do with religion.,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. And, after reading it I am very concerned about the credibility of Stanford University's business program. ""Creativity in Business"" was not a practical guide to increasing creativity within the workforce. Instead, too many pages were devoted to occult and New Age practices such as getting in touch with spirit guides.This book is going into my garbage can, not my library!"
2,Disappointing,"Coming out of Stanford, I expected a solid book. Instead it's a new age, kind of occult book that I did not finish reading. Surely, this can't be what is taught at Stanford this days or is it."
4,There is one other Hit song missing....,"I like the CD but it lacks one popular hit. ""Try Again"" If this is the "" Very Best Of Champaign"", Where is the song ""Try Again""? Other wise, the CD is good."
4,Try Again,"This album is a great 80's flash back album. The only problem is that Morris Day of THE TIME co-wrote one of their best songs ""Try Again"". He did not release the rights to this song, so the album has a missing part of the passion. Other wise this is a great CD purchase."
3,"Best of Chanpaign is ""How Bout us""","We purchased this product for How bout us and that is great the other songs are not. We are happy with the one song, shame we couldn't purchase the one song on line."
2,Where's Try Again?,On a CD you can record up to 15 songs (perhaps more). I don't understand the issue of leaving Try Again out of this compilation. No Champaign greatest hits album is complete without this excellent songs!
5,One Great Song,"The best track is the first, ""How 'Bout Us?""...when I first heard it, I thought it was The Manhattans.....the remaining tracks don't rise to this level in that this song really shows the great harmonies of this group...they should have stuck with the same composer/lyricist....Mike"
2,Hello?,"Not only is try Again missing, Why is Party Line missing also. This is far from the best of ."
4,Was a gift,I never inquired if the child liked it so I cannot say for certain but I never heard any complaints
1,GOD THIS IS HORRIBLE,THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS WARNING: NEVER LISTENT TO THESE SONGS OR IT WILL TAINT YOUR IMAGE OF COSTELLO FOREVER
5,The BEST way to properly identify the validity of a car.,"This book gives just the right amount of detail to provide the car owner or a buyer with what the numbers really mean. It will also tell you in a hurry whether the equipment on your car is truly ""original"" I have accurately identified my 71 Elky as well as many others.It is also a great reference when buying an ""original"" car. As some options for some cars were not identified by the factory apart from the original build sheet, the book only tells you about the numbers that you can find on various components. As an example, a 1970 SS was not identified by any of the numbers as an SS except on the build sheet. However, as any knowledgable enthusiast knows, the build number of the car (6 digits) is also stamped on the front of the block.All in all a great book. Excellent for the Classic Chevy enthusiast Library."
2,Not a Good Book For Canadian Built Cars,This book is very good if you have a US built Chevelle. Has no Info on Canadian Built Chevelles. You can find more info on the web than what's in this book.
5,Perfect Mary Jane!,"The Stride Rite ""Felicia"" is absolutely the most perfect Mary Jane shoe. This is the only one I would ever buy for my daughter. And...what a great price."
4,works well,I bought it to connect my computer to my tv and it worked out well so I can watch downloaded shows or movies on my tv but now I just need the sound.
1,Very misleading!,"I thought this was going to be a book full of jokes ending with the punchline, ""That's what she said"". Lame."
5,A major improvement over metal paint cans,"Storage of leftover paint has always been a problem for us. We want to keep enough for future touch up, but paint cans deteriorate quickly.These storage containers close easily and should weather the test of time. They stack nicely and don't give that HAZMAT dump look of rusty paint cans."
2,"Great stuff, but there are better comps out there","I was sorely disappointed with this collection which had bootleg sound quality (vinyl pops etc) and practically no info whatsover regarding these artists. There is even one track credited to Clothilde, which was actually by Cleo. Though they are out of print and much harder to find, I'd recommend that you pass this up and seek out the 2 original vinyl only Swinging Mademoiselle compilations issued on Sasha Monnett records (which also appears to have been the source for at least one of the tracks included here) or any of the 6 CD volumes of Ultra Chicks."
2,"Great music, lame compilation","Annoyingly, this brazenly rips off the title of the well-known - and much more lovingly compiled - Swinging Mademoiselle compilations. Everything about it is as unoriginal and careless as the borrowed title, from the songs attributed to the wrong artists to the generic, uninformative liner notes. Not to mention that every track is available on other compilations. A listless attempt to cash in on a trend and others' good taste and hard work.Yes, the music itself is wonderful, but instead go for the superior Femmes De Paris and Pop A Paris compilations, or try to track down the original Swinging Mademoiselle or Ultra Chicks comps, as a previous reviewer suggested."
5,"What it means for a school to be declared ""failing""","America's ""Failing"" Schools: How Parents And Teachers Can Cope With No Child Left Behind by education testing expert W. James Popham focuses upon providing parents and classroom teachers with clear, precise explanations of the Bush administration's ""No Child Left Behind"" doctrine and the implications this policy has for standardized testing, as well as what it means for a school to be declared ""failing"", and concrete suggestions for what can be done in response to such a school (and school district) condition. America's ""Failing"" Schools is timely and welcome reading which is especially commended to the attention of concerned parents, classroom teachers, school administrators, citizen groups like the PTA, and governmental policy makers on the state and federal level in the field of K-12 public education."
3,"Not bad, Not entirely good though","Thomas Vikstrom has a unique voice and I like his fast vibratos. I really like Stormwind but I think there are better neo-classical bands.I think ""Samuraj"" is Stormwind's best song. Too bad that was the first song I ever heard by them and every other song I heard after that was a bit of a disappointment.A great CD, the second disc is eh-ok."
5,the best of the animated series,"this is by far the best episode in the entire animated series of the guyver. I don't know what's up with these reviews you guys have but all but one are in the wrong place. the death of the gyver is the best episode because of great animation, and a fantastic fight scene. no matter how many times i saw this episode it always kept me satisfied. if you like the guyver this episode is a keeper."
5,GUYVER ROCKS!,"The story is better the first, and the special effects, eventhough they both kick a$$, Guyver 2 was more serious than the original. If liked the guyver you'll like Guyver 2, the effects are better,the story was better,and the hero is better................................................"
2,"""This model has been recalled!""","Only a marginal improvement on the first film. The basic problems remain the same: repetitious fight sequences, monster costumes that look patently silly, cackling villains, and an obvious plot development: finding a space ship. They tried to take things too seriously this time out, beginning with the breakup of the lead character and his girlfriend of the first film (both played by different actors and not much in the way of an upgrade). While the first film was dopey, this one was mopey. Even worse, the plot was infinitely forgettable. It had something to do with an archeological dig half populated by rubber thingies prone to cackling and beating their chests for effect. I like camp and camping as well as the next person but in this case, they just went too far with it. Lame by any name: The Guyver 2."
1,One of the worst movies ever made,"A bunch of guy in rubber suits pounding their chests and fighting eachother. Yipppeee! Plot awful. Acting awful. Silly thing is the Guyver dude has a laser weapon that he could use to beat every opponent, but instead he does kung fu and gets his butt kicked half the time. Guyver one was awful and this even more campy.If there is any value in it its as an unintended comedy. One of those movies you turn down the volume and add your own dialog."
3,"Bare Bones, and Damaged Out Of Print","My husband ordered the movie... The first thing we noticed was a long cut through the barcode... Ok so that means the dvd is out of print... However the factory went over board with cutting through the barcodes as it went through the DVD Case sleeve and went through the actual case as well! Many people have been complaining about this and I can see why... When I order something I expect the item to be NEW and UNDAMAGED! Do they have to be that lazy to take a knife and slice away? Companies are suppose to be using a MARKER for the barcode... This prevents damage to the case... It's real simple...As for the dvd itself... It could of been better... It was bare bones... No extras at all... That to me is a sloppy job... They could of added some cast interviews, art galleries ect... It's a good movie and I feel that it could of had better treatment..."
2,The best we can hope for...,"Guyver fans across the universe will undoubtedly recognize their favorite bio-boosting hero starring in this live-action movie...What they don't realize is that the movie is absolute ... compared to the anime or manga.The movie is a cheesy, poorly written adaptation of the anime series. Although better than the first movie (by far!), this flick still feels forced, unnecessary and constrained, as though the producers ran out of budget money and couldn't afford to make it any better.If this is your first experience with the Guyver, go out to your local import store and buy the anime videos: this movie pales in comparison to them. If you're a dedicated Guyver fan considering purchasing these movies...don't. Even at [money], the movie isn't worth it."
5,"""One of THE Best Movies Based On An Anime""","Anyone who saw the first Guyver movie and didn't like it, don't worry. This movie is AWESOME! For one, I have both animes on DVD. If you pay attention to the anime and movie, you will notice similarities between them. One is where Sean jumps off the cliff and changes into the Guyver in midair! In the anime, he jumped off a fence at his school (very high up) and did the exact same thing. Steve Wang and his crew did an excellent job.David Hayter I believed delivered a strong performance that is worthy of attention. Also, let's not forget that the first movie never showewd him using his laser (located above the Control Metal) even once! The fight scenes are superb (especially the fight between the Guyver and the Guyver Zoanoid). The only thing that I disliked was some of the dialouge, but it's forgivable. Anyone who likes sci-fi or anime based films, this is one I highly recommend to pick up."
4,How a Guyver movie should be,"One of the obvious differences in this sequel is that the producers paid a lot more attention in the story and acting. You no longer get the over-emphasised transformation and the humour, but in place you have fantastic actions and a good plot.You can be fulfilled with Guyver 1 if you're simply looking for special effects, but if you're looking for genuine sci-fi actions with a strong storyline, then this sequel is a must.Defintely one of the best sequels. I think the producers had learnt from their mistakes. Considering that they were willing to make a part 2 (with success) after such a poor original, makes me wonder why they aren't producing a part 3..."
4,AWESOME,By far this video is a whole lot better than the original. Movie deals a whole lot more on mystery and an actual plot unlike its predecessor which dealt with more comedy and no plot. Fighting scenes are excellent but plot does take a long time to unfold in early minutes of movie. I still recommend buying it and currently waiting for a DVD Version (a long shot I know).
3,"Close, really close.","This sequel to the first Guyver in the live action version faired slightly better than its first. Better fight sequences and props. They did their homework and just passed. Nothing excellent, but it did offer a little insight as to what happened in the comic series(verrrrry little). For those who have not seen any of the anime, watch either of the live action movies first and then the anime. If you do it the other way around you will be greatly disappointed."
3,better then the first at least,"still not as good as the original (if you have no idea what im talkin bout look the movie up here its really good! or u can rent it). This one wasnt as goofy as the first and more serious, but i still think that the movie wasnt made for uhh how can i say it...for people...or uhh it was made for animation..hows that..anyway. Its good still and better zoinoids and fx too =-)"
5,A RevelationThis,"This wonderful recording is one to treasure. The music is beautiful and sublimely performed. Listening to these songs from the Orthodox Jewish Liturgy has opened up a whole new world of sacred repertoire for men and boys choir... an area of music in which I have always been passionately interested. I hope that one day we will see this precious tradition honoured within the similarly great tradition of Anglican Cathedral choirs of Men and Boys. The connections are fascinating, especially the use of the high male voice, whether as boy or adult alto."
5,A Must See!!!,"This movie was extraordinary and changed my life. Lindsay Wagner and Jeffrey Fields are wonderful. After watching this movie, it makes you stop to think about who and what's really important in your life. A DEFINITE MUST SEE! You will not be disappointed. As a matter of fact, I keep looking to see when it will be on again.What makes this movie so special . . is once you become involved, you almost stop to wonder - this is exactly what I want to have a ONCE IN A LIFETIME experience with someone special."
4,watched probably different from book version,"I saw the television version of once in a lifetime, and the jeffery character was played by Rex Smith who is also a singer also. would have liked uncut version of movie because viewer usually misses something. storyline somewhat confusing if you come in the middle of story, glad the lead female chose the right man. young actor who played her son, excellent. hope that Mr. Smith does more film work with Ms. Wagner. his part in this film too short. his talent is unrated like Mr. Bostwicks. good to watch on quiet afternoon or snowy day!!"
2,Fluff,Not enough bikes-the story line of muddled images reminds me of nonsensical dreams we all sometimes have; the haunting effects of which are meaningless.
1,i can't believe what i'm reading,"this is the worst film, in my opinion. i thought there was nothing redeeming about it. it was so over the top cheesy. if you like really lame movies about cliches, this is it."
1,Worst movie i've ever seen in my life!,"This movie is beyond terrible. I was thinking about selling mine back to Amazon, but thought it would be inhumane to sell this piece of garbage to another human being!"
3,cult classic potential,"Simple, ultra-violent story with over the top acting and a questionable script. Some well known actors add to the craziness. Nonetheless, I found it to be a guilty pleasure and I really enjoyed it"
4,Fun stuff,This movie is alot of fun to watch but does not really have any substance to it.That's ok cause that is just what I was expecting. It is what it is and for the price I will at least watch it every once in a while. Fun acting with a few girls and of course some bikes!!
3,"""Now give me a hand cause I got things to go and places to do.""","A great retro story basically ruined by Larry ""Combover"" Bishop. I guess he's had this biker fantasy for a while, lets hope he got that out of his system.Reminiscent of some of the better 60's biker flicks, updated with the presence of Michael Madsen and the incomparable Vinnie Jones. Good to see Dennis Hopper still alive and well....barely. 3 Wings"
4,Hellatious Fun!,"I agree with some of the other reviews that this movie was not intended to top or compete with Easy Rider which was a great movie. It is classic Tarantino influence attempting to capture that old school drive in movie feel. Campy, Corny, and Cheesy but definitely entertaining.It is simply not more complicated that that and that's why it works. It satisfies some base need for violence, sex, and revenge that we as Americans love. There's a bad boy or girl in all of us even if we don't act that way in real life. That's why these movies are so good. We can live vicariously through these characters and dare to dream about being tough sexy free as hell bad asses. Great movie Larry Bishop."
5,"Heavenly chicks, hot bikes, one helluva ride!!!","Seriously.... this moive kicks butt... the babes are hot as hell, the bikes are awesome and there is plenty bullets and arrows flying around!!! in the style of wild angels (by the way I heard that lil toon playing in the background of hell ride... the one of wild angels), hells angels on wheels... with a punch of modern attitude!!! very cool!!!"
3,ok,"Interesting movie, but thought it was going to be more action. A little slow in the middle. But okay purchase."
2,Not for me,Just did not enjoy anything about this movie. Luckly I paid a good price so not too upset and make its dobad is bought this movie years ago and forgot how bad it was.
2,Great actors in a mediocre storyline,"Hello DVD buyers,If you are curious about new films to buy or watch Let me give you some feedback on my thoughts and reactions to this film HELL RIDE before you decide whether to purchase the product or not.Firstly, IF you are Die hard fans of ERIC BALFOUR or MICHAEL MADSEN...pick it up...great scenes that they work on throughout the film.Another note...if you like bikers and lots of attractive ladies that are naked...you might also like this movie.However...if you are looking for a great story or plotline...DO NOT and I mean DO NOT consider this in your collection...its poorly written and the actors struggle to make heads as to whether or not we should care about anything...granted they state that in the special feats.I like a few songs but otherwise not a film I am going to watch over and over and over again.Thanks for reading and good luck."
5,hell ride,"Great movie.Had never heard of it.Just ran across it on Amazon.I had to watch it twice to pick up a lot of the story that got by me the first time.Some might say it's a bit odd,like Quentin Tarentino seems to do.Which I like.I could easily watch this over again & again."
4,Awesome addicting movie,"I think Hell Ride is such an awesome movie, from the soundtrack to the action scenes to the few comedic sayings! Ever since the first time I caught it on cable I became heavily addicted, always catching something I left behind the few times I seen it before! I would highly recommend this to people who love action flicks, and biker flicks!!"
4,Great sewing machine value,"I highly recommend this sewing machine. I purchased it in January, but wanted to use it awhile before writing a review. Since then, I've used it to make 5 large drapery panels and it's been a wonderful machine. Several of the panels I made were lined and made of heavy fabric and the machine handled it well. I experienced a couple jams on the really thick folded over portions, but nothing that wasn't easily fixed.This is the first computerized machine I've used. I was accustomed to an old heavy duty Singer. It felt very light at first, but I've grown to like that aspect -- it's much easier to put it away when not in use. The machine was easy to learn; it had a very clear instruction manual. My favorite features so far are the blind hem stitch and the self-threading needle."
4,"So far, so good","I've had my machine for less than a month, so do not yet have extensive experience with it. However, I have found it to be super-easy to use and I like it a lot so far. For the price, it certainly seems to be a good machine. A couple small criticisms: the light could definitely be brighter--and unless I leave a lot of thread through the needle, it tends to come unthreaded."
4,"Bullet proof...not really, but close","i've owned a few sewing machines, this one is probable the most expencive, even then it's at a fair price. I serve in the US Navy as an Engineer. my sewing machine lives in a back pack wedged in some oily waste transfer piping. so far only one piece broke off, the bumper for when you refill the spindle. i use it to mend my friends uniforms, hems, put on patches and practical jokes. for that it works great! i kinda failed to read the instruction manuel but it was easy enough to figure out and sets up quickly. any questions (like the other stich modes)there is an online manuel. my only complaint is some times it doesn't seem to have the power i want to blast through the heavier, multiple layers of fabric/patches and i'll hear the gears slip. maybe the needle is dull? what ever the case, i intend to make a queen size quilt out of rags someday. that will be awesome!"
1,Don't bother with this Brother,This machine makes me hate sewing. Wasted a whole day trying to get rid of the repeated E6 error. Wish I had not purchased this piece of junk. Worthless.
1,Disappointing sewing machine--BrotherES-2000,"This machine was a total disappointment. I bought it for my grand daughter who had just completed sewing lessons on an identical sewing machine. She was so excited and thrilled that she was going to get it, and when she did, the machine locked up every time she started to sew!I know it was the machine and not my grand daughter because my daughter, an experienced sewer, tried and tried to get it to work correctly!I returned the machine and bought a different model locally, which works like a charm.Brother ES2000 77 Stitch Function Computerized Free Arm Sewing MachineThe above rating of one star is really not my opinion--The site is set up so that you must rate at least one star, otherwise, the whole reviw will not be used. My rating is No Stars, had I been able to document it."
5,"Great for Beginner, Intermediate and some advanced features","I really love this sewing machine. I am a beginner so I spent the first night going through the whole instruction book with some scrap fabric before I decided to start making a dress. The instructions are very easy to understand for a beginner and I feel that the features will even help me to move into my intermediate stage of sewing. I highly recommend this sewing machine because it accommodates all your sewing needs. You are able to do simple things like sew a hem on pants because of the free arm and even take on more complicated quilting projects. I am in love with the automatic bobbin winder as I was a little scared that I would have to do as my grandmother does and purchase a separate bobbin winder machine. I do wish it came with more empty bobbins however they are cheap to buy so it doesn't matter that much. In all, this machine is perfect."
3,New technology!!,"This machine is a replacement of my 35 yr old Viking. The instructions are excellant in my opinion, easy to thread both top and bobbin thread. I do find it much harder to thread the needle as the LED light is not asbright as needed making it harder to see the project I am sewing on also. The automatic needle threader also does not work, I think a part is missing. The selection of stitches is awesome and real easy to select. Have only sewed a few projects and overall I am pleased with its performance except for the issues stated above."
4,You get what you pay for.,"The machine is great and easy to use. I have used it for zippers, army uniforms, velcro, and simple projects with ease. I only give 4 stars because of the misleading ""77 stitch function"" advertisement. The machine only has 39 built in stitches and some of the stitches pictured in the description are not on this machine at all."
4,brother es2000 sewing machine,"This machine is lightweight, easy to use, and the instruction manual is excellent. I am a novice and mainly use the machine for repairs and very easy projects. The reason I bought the computerized machine is that it selects the stitch length & width automatically. It can be changed if you want but it doesn't have to be set by you. I am very happy with this purchase."
1,Item brok within a few days,"My wife has been sewing for decades and when she got this machine she was very excited. Within two or three jobs it failed to turn on again. Not sure if we got a dud or what, but we were very dissappointed."
4,Just received my machine...,"I am having trouble setting the tension on the machine.I wish the light over the sewing area were brighter.The instruction book could be more instructive.Should have one for each type of machine with different functions, such as bobbin winder, etc.I will let you know later how it goes.The tension is killing me, per say."
2,$175?,"Dear lord - $175 for an under-300-pages collection of academic papers. I have not seen the book, but would point interested readers to ""Handbook of sports and lottery markets"", edited by Hausch and Ziemba, which seems to be an all-around superior choice."
5,Mad isn't funny. It's hilarious.,"Greate idea for a book. Apart from burning it. You can read some of Mad's greatest articles in shortened form! It rocks! I can't think of anyone better to write an introduction than the man who brought life to Canibal!the musical, Orgazmo and BASEketball (Ignoring South Park) to life! Yes, trey parker! Buy it"
5,"""Ireland has no past, its history is present.""","Touching look at a group of college students attending the New University of Ulster during the turbulent late 60s/early 70s. Follow Kate, Deirdre, Sheila, Roger, Liam and Jack as they struggle with what it means to be Catholic, Protestant, Irish, Christian, just and loving in a world that has, sadly, changed little since then."
2,"Sadly, a Rather Dull Biography","This is the story of Stephen Foster, who wrote so many songs in the nineteenth century that are considered American standards such as ""Oh, Susanna"", ""Campdown Races"" and ""Swanee River"". The book focuses on Foster as one of the first song writers to be benefited by the commercialization of music, in the guise of sheet music and copyrights. He became a well recognized figure based upon his fame as a popular music composer. Foster initially struggled to be a successful composer, then spend of good part of the rest of his life in court defending his rights and chasing ""music pirates"", to use a modern term. However, the book is not easy to read. The author goes on for page after page, chapter after chapter, relating how Foster did this and went there and said that and after a while it becomes a blur. Recommended only to those who really have an interest in the subject."
4,Concept of Marketing,"I used this textbook last semester in my first marketing class. I didn't know much about marketing.This book explains very clearly what marketing is, and gave examples of companies that are using the marketing concept, and how it affects customers.The Book also presents ways that you, the consumer can tell weather or not a company is using the marketing concept in order to satisy your needs."
2,Marketing,"I paid far too much for the product received. The binder was broken and some of the pages were torn. I had to buy reinforcements for the whole book (looseleaf) and another binder. All-in-all, I was VERY disappointed in this purchase."
3,Thanks for the memories -- Gracias por los recuerdos!,"This is a nice collection of movies I saw when I was a teen featuring some of my favorite Mexican singers at the time (Alberto Vazquez, Angelica Maria, and Julissa), as well as talented comedians such as Mauricio Garces and Jorge Suarez. Only one of the movies I didn't care for because it is not a comedy but a deppressing drama, the one with Enrique Guzman. The other five are pure fun and music ... and all this at a price can't be beat!Esta es una coleccion de peliculas que vi cuando era mucho mas joven, protagonizadas por algunos de mis cantantes favoritos de aquella epoca (Alberto Vazquez, Angelica Maria, y Julissa), al igual que comediantes talentosos, tales como Mauricio Garces y Jorge Suarez. Tan solo una de las peliculas es un drama deprimente, en la que figura Enrique Guzman. Las demas son pura risa y musica ... y todo esto a un precio que no puede ser mas bajo!"
4,Good buy,"I bought this monitor in May. The only issue was single faulty pixel (it couldn't turn off, and would always show blue, but would not show up if any composite color, like white, was needed). I haven't seen a need to return it because the colors are bright and vivid, games and movies play fine, and the monitor looks great.The design itself is very sleek, the buttons are very subtle and out of the way. This can be annoying when initially setting it up, but after adjusting the brightness, the buttons just disappear into the thin bezel.I paid around $500 (after shipping) for this; it's a great monitor, and would be a bargain at that price or less."
2,"It's OK, but...","I was dissapointed by this book for several reasons. First, it lacks a lot of words I think are essential (although this can of course be a matter of opinion). Second, sometimes the German words given are misspelled or the wrong plural form given. Third, it uses British English. I love our British friends and allies dearly, but I often was not able to decipher what a British word meant in American English. Fourth, the editing was sloppy -- sometimes a word will show up two or three times in the same section or list. I would recommend Berlitz's German vocabulary book instead."
2,Nothing special,"Just nothing special about this album. Good effort, but honestly can't say i can recommend this."
5,read this review,"this band is very good. i listen to anything from metal, screamo, to punk and emo. SO this band is awesome. they remind me of rise against which is the best punk band ever. The singer has a raspie voice but sounds good for this. the drummer is very talented, i enjoy drumming along to this. i reccomend this to any punk fan. I also strongly reccomend rise against"
3,WAIT a MINute!,"The Works of Howard Fast are incendiary,no doubt...Whether he rises into the sunlight of great literature, as does Steinbeck in works of a similar genre, or remains in the depths of vituperation, remains to be seen...The important thing to remember is, all of his characters and situations are strictly FICTIONAL and have nothing whatever to do with history, even those put forward as being historical! In ""Spartacus"", for example, his Spartacus is a man totally made up according to the Marxist scheme of things. With all the real sorrows to get excited about, why are we spending time on fictional ones? However, if you want the best of Fast, you need to read ""The Hessian."""
2,A Rehash of The Neon Wilderness,"On its own, this might be worth three and a half stars. The problem is that it contains too many segments lifted right out of The Neon Wilderness. Yes, this is true of some of Algren's other works, but it happened in far too many places here. The lack of focus on the main character makes it feel like Algren simply assembled a skeleton to hang together some of his short stories. The reader deserves better."
3,Not exactly an uplifting read,"I've read this book twice now. First in college for a literature class, and again 8 years later. Both times it depressed me. Granted, that is the book's purpose. To provide a realistic and tragic glimpse into the lives of some of America's least fortunate during the depression. Though it is interesting and well written, I can't say that I would tell my best friend to read it."
2,Not vintage J.D.,"I was very sorry I listened to some of the other reviewers on this one. I have a lot of John's stuff and this is the worst album/CD I have. If you want the great, soul stirring John Denver ballads or upbeat (Calypso type) songs don't waste you money on this CD."
2,"Good Songs, Lousy production","Some of the best songs that John has ever recorded. Could have been a breakthough album for him. Unfortunately, the snare drum is all you hear on all of the tracks. I was hoping that when it was released on CD it would have been remixed and the drums lowered in the mix. Not so. It really ruins this CD."
2,BIG JOHN DENVER FAN VERY DISAPPOINTED,"This CD has 3 very good songs (Don't Close Your Eyes, Tonight, If Ever and Dreamland Express) but the rest belong in some shame pit somewhere. This one was the beginning of the end for Denver."
4,A Beautiful 'Dreamland Express' Indeed!,"Pay no attention to the reviews of those below mine from St. Louis, MO and from South Carolina. They do not know what they are talking about. Snare drum or no snare drum, this is one of Mr. Denver's finest moments. This is a mature John Denver with some of the most stirring songs, arrangements and lyrics of John's career. He could not stay Mr. Rocky Mountain High forever. Even John Denver had to grow up; and grow up musically and spiritually he did. If only we still had him with us to record more wonderful albums such as this one. ""Don't Close Your Eyes Tonight"" is a standout track on this CD."
4,It helped to bring me back,"Having bought JD's albums since 1972 I had a lull - if I got bored or not I have no idea, he just did not seem to fit anymore. So I missed some releases. This was one, but when I heard it I regreted missing it - the music is rarely spectacular but it is very warm and engaging. Now the CD is a regular on my play list simply because it makes me feel good.And it generated my interest in his other late period releases. It is too easy to be critical as it set no real hights, but there are no lows either. It covers a variety of styles (Doo Wop as well) but remains JD - try it and you won't be sorry - except that you didn't hear it sooner."
5,Dreamland Express CD,"I had a vinyl album of this years ago and wanted a CD. I went to Amazon, found it, ordered it and received it within four days. The product is as advertised and I am enjoying it."
1,Do NOT Purchase!!,"Pros: Good scanner---no problems with at least that function!!Cons: DO NOT PURCHASE! Poor graphics--poor ink use--NOT user friendly--and requires service within 2 years!My parents purchased me and my brothers each one of the MFC 3420C Inkjet Multifunction Printers---what a waste of time and money!First off--the self cleaning function literally drains your ink supply. The print quality is less than standard, and you need to keep the manual at the ready because you're going to need it! Then in at LEAST a year---be prepared for a trip to the shop! We own 3 of these---and all THREE DIED WITHIN FIVE MONTHS OF EACH OTHER!! Mine was the last to go...I did what it said and after alot of frustration now have a large paperweight!! Best printer I ever owned was an HP Photosmart. Going to get another asap---right after we three contact Brother about a few problems!"
1,Concerned about factual errors,"Having read through Sam H. Shirakawa's ""The Devil's Music Master"", I must express some misgivings. I have noticed a number of factual errors which lead me to wonder what else is incorrect. For example, on page 393 he identifies singers on a tour of South America as ""Karl Wiedemann, Paul Seider, Walter Laufkötter"" when those singers are in fact named Hermann Wiedemann, August Seider and Karl Laufkötter. Another error that I noticed, on page 424, Gottlob Frick's year of birth is given as 1908 and it states he sang well into the 1970s. According to Kutsch and Riemens' ""Grosses Sangerlexikon"" Frick was born in 1906 and his official farewell was in 1970. There were some appearances after that - he performed on the Solti Parsifal studio recording is one example that comes to mind - but that hardly constitutes performing ""well into the 1970s"". This sort of sloppiness undermines Shirakawa's credibility and makes me wonder what else is inaccurate."
1,Disappointing,"For openers, who is the author. I've never heard of Sam H. Shirakawa and I would like to know what are his credentials for commenting on the music made by Furtwangler and his life. Any temptation to give the author the benefit of any doubt, given the high reputation of publisher Oxford University Press, is eradicated by the howler of an error on page 177. In an aside, Shirakawa tells us that Theodore Roosevelt was Franklin Roosevelt's grandfather. I would have thought every schoolchild knows that Teddy was the fifth (!!!) cousin of FDR. (How could the prestigious publisher let this error slip by??) After reading that, it is very difficult to accept at face value what Shirakawa asks us to accept regarding his scholarship and expertise. More generally, and a further criticism of the publisher, the book is too long and mmmuch too repetitive. All in all, a disappointing read about a genius music maker."
4,Good but not Great...,"These combs are made of really good plastic. I was impressed with the initial quality.Then I tried to put them on, they use a 'spring' type attachment to keep them on. I noticed that the 'spring' part gets stuck often and I have to 'force' it back after use (only on some of the combs)I'm not sure how long they will last, the 'spring' is very cheap, but does the job. They are the nicest combs I've seen other than the 'spring' issue."
1,Review for Andis B & B Universal Comb 12995,"This set of andis universal comb doesn't work with the andis bgrc clippers. This set might work with another style of Andis clippers, but it sure doesn't work with the BGRC clipper series. After I received this set and tried all possible options to see if any of the combs would fit, BUT all attempts were unsuccessful. Then I called Andis via their 800 #, spoke with someone who confirmed that the B & B Universal Comb 12995 would NOT work with the BGRC. I was advised to purchase a different set of combs. So, I wasted my money on that set."
1,Irresponsible vendor,"The wrong size combs were sent for my Andis T-Outliner. An immediate Auto -Response for my request for exchange or refund was received.No further follow up.After almost 2 weeks of no further action I contacted Amazon.Amazon's immediate follow up on the matter was 5 star.After acknowledging the authenticity of the matter, arranged for the proper Refund."
1,Barker Breaker,Am very disappointed with the results of this item. It has a very loud high pitch scream and my dogs do not stop barking. It just adds to the chaos.
3,"I love this perfume, but it smells old.","I was excited to get this on sale, now I think I know why, it smells stale, old...not like it usually smells, and I should know, its the only perfume I wear. Was dissappointed, but for the price kept it anyway. Hopefully someone will get me some for Christmas. This is the first time I have ever been dissappointed by anything I have bought from Amazon, so I will keep buying and I recommend you do too!"
2,so so,This did not smell as good as the bottle I bought from Sephora. It kind of smells like it has more alcohol in it or something. Next time I will spend the extra money and go to Sephora.
1,Counterfeit or old... plus NO RETURN!,"If I could give this item only half a star I would.The smell is definitely altered, as it is the colour. ArmaniMania is one of my favourite perfumes, I got compliments every time I wore it.This one smells ""cheap"" and it's giving me headaches.On top of everything, one cannot return a perfume to Amazon! Apparently because it's a flammable item - one wonders, if that's the case, how come THEY were able to ship it to one in the first place?!?I do NOT recommend buying perfumes from Amazon - this is the second perfume that I bought here and is defective. I'll also consider hard buying any other items from them...Their ""no return"" policy on this item, or any other items, should be posted VISIBLY, in caps, as a warning, for people to know BEFORE they buy... because honestly, it feels like Amazon is scamming the people!"
5,Perfume,"The perfume is wonderful. I was not able to find it in the stores I go to, so I was happy to get it with Amazon."
4,Mania by Armani,"I spent years trying to find a perfume close to discontinued Indecence by Ginvenchy, to no avail, until I tried Mania by Giorgio. Armani Fro Women is not quite as sweet as Indecence, though sweet is not what I'd call Indecence. However, I have had compliments from men and women on Mania. It does not last as long, even when layering with the lotion, but at least I've found a perfume that is as close as I have tried; and I've tried at least a hundred. It is a daytime perfume, casual, but I wear it for evening, because I do not like heavy perfumes. It is a bit musky, which I like, but not over-powering. It is a sensual fragrance and not flowery, so it has lasting power. I love it."
1,bad shipping,"the product can't be departure to my country because is a dangerous product.I have no idea about this, and i need return the perfum, please contact me for this problem."
3,doesn't smell good on me!,"I recieved Armani Mania for women sample today, very fast service would defenitely do business with this retailer again but i dont care for this perfume on me, i'm so glad i ordered a sample first!"
5,Armania Mania Perfume,Can't beat the price. This was packaged well. Arrived in a timely manner. I buy all my perfume online. I will continue to purchase perfume from this sellar.
1,Not good,"Written with all the realism, originality and character development of a soap opera. Fortunately, also with the suspense of a decent thriller. But the mystery is sustained only by vague hints of X-rays that are hardly connected to the action, the romance develops with utter predictability and the ending can hardly be called original or surprising. Final score: full marks on the suck-o-scale."
4,Good!,This has turned out to be a great resource! It was a required text for a class but I have really enjoyed the read.
5,Better than the rest,"I generally loathe ed books and have found most to be pretty useless to the actual teacher in a real classroom. Not so Ms. Rapp Ruddell's book! In Mary Ellen Vogt's class at Cal State Long Beach, we had the benefit of reading this book in Galley form.IT IS SO WORTH IT.I don't know about the second and third edition, but this first one is GOLD! BUY IT!"
4,Fascinating,"I liked the title of this book and picked it up at a used book sale - what a great buy! The author has an easy style of writing and has had tremendous experiences. He visits the South Pacific in the late 50's/early 60's and describes the military remnants from WWII. His travel is not always easy as many of the islands have no airline service.I did not expect to enjoy this book so much - which makes it all the more intriguing. Highly recommended to anyone who loves history, travel, journeys, the islands."
4,Bettas Complete Guide,If you are looking for a complete guide book this is it. It will provide you with great details in caring for your Betta fish.
2,No specifics on caring for a new fish.,"I bought this book because I needed to know what was the best way to set up a tank, and how to feed my fish and treat the water.The book says any container will do, feeding once a day isn't enough, and give them all sorts of foods. Literally, this is the only useful information contained for someone who just bought their first beta.Nice photos, interesting trivia, but I'm still wondering how to care for my new betta."
5,"Good starting book, for those interested","This book has a lot of information for the beginner and possibly an upscale betta breeder. I myself have this book and am quite pleased with the information it has. If you like or own bettas, buy this book."
4,Great book for non-beginners,"I found this book easy to understand, but as a beginner with bettas it didn't answer all my questions. It mostly covers aspects of breeding bettas with more general info interspersed. It did make me want to try breeding bettas however! I would suggest another more beginner book if you've never had bettas or are not going to breed them. I can't recommend any though, as this is the only one I have so far. I bought this one at the recommendation of the guy in the fish store."
2,"a disappointment as a ""Complete Introduction""","Perhaps this book should have been titled My Life Raising Bettas to Sell to Pet Shops. It is more interesting as autobiography than a reference. There are only seven pages of basic betta care. The majority of the chapters are related to breeding and raising bettas for a pet shop market. The section on fin forms and colors and color variations would make a handy basic reference---if it had pictures to illustrate the descriptions. It does have a lot of color pictures and the captions provide some of the most concise and interesting information. If you have an interest in economical fish raising and selling, this book has information for you. Don't buy it as your basic reference, do buy it for the pictures."
4,Recommended for betta breeders and sellers,"This book has some bits of information on basic betta care and it provides plenty of advice on the breeding of bettas (environmental conditions that encourage spawning and possible deviations that can occur during the spawning process) and the raising of the fry (first foods, water maintenance and jarring). It is recommended for those who are interested in the challenge of going into the mass production and sale of bettas for fun and for profit."
3,better for breeders than those who just want pets.,"The chapters are:IntroductionWhat is a betta?Keeping bettasSpawning bettasRaising the fryBuying bettasRaising bettas for fun and profitSo as you can see, it's mostly about breeding and selling betta fish. It would definetely be good if you're planning on doing that, but otherwise I wouldn't bother buying it. While it does have some helpful information (diagram of different parts and fins of the betta, information on housing, and foods) it would be much more helpful if there were a section on health (diseases and treating them) and diagrams of the different kinds of betta fish (since this is a book about breeding them!)."
3,The Book,"I liked the book, it helped me out. This was my first betta. I only didn't like it because I was looking for information on caring and such, and most of the bood covers breeding."
4,Vertex 2,"I bought the Alps Mountaineering Vertex 2 with backpack hunting in mind. I used it on a few trips last fall and the tent performed very well. The last trip was in October with snow on the ground and temperatures down to -3 or -4C. It was large enough for two men(not a lot of spare room), with packs and rifles fitting nicely in the vestibules. The Vertex 2 was easy to set up, withstood some wind and rain, and the dual doors/vestibules system was great. It would be the perfect size for one man solo but for a few nights in decent weather two is ok. What surprised me was the price, it would seem to be a decent quality tent for for an economy price. I guess time and hard usage will tell. It is light enough, especially if there are two people to split the load with, ie I carry the tent my buddy carries the Scotch everybody is happy. I intend to use it a number of times this coming year starting in May or as soon as the snow comes off the alpine. Great price for a great tent."
1,"Terrible quality: a cheap, infuriating waste of money","It's my own fault for being tight and trying to save money, but the people who have previously reviewed this item are also partly to blame. They either work for the company, or don't know a thing about camping gear. This tent is an absolute piece of junk that should not ever be available for purchase. Weighs more and is bigger folded up than they claim, and shoddily built with heavy, poor quality materials. The pole across the top broke on the second night of use and I was unable to remove the jammed piece to do a running repair so spent the trip with the inner mesh in our faces. In the future will be buying another brand, and will never consider anything made by Alps again. There should be a zero star option to rate it. Don't even consider buying this tent or you deserve everything you get, as I did. 'Mountaineering vertex'... What a joke."
4,Excellent,"Drenched in reverb, like My Morning Jacket, but much softer and with kick-ass melodies. Definitely worth listening to, especially if you are a fan of After the Gold Rush-era Neil Young."
4,"Gorgeous music, but a little repetitive","This album suffered from a common problem--I couldn't always tell when the songs changed because they were so similar. But the music is introspective, with beautiful lyrics and vocals, and the instrumentals are dreamy and full of feeling."
4,Great Lake Swimmers,Songs Include : Moving Pictures Silent Films / The Man With No Skin / Moving Shaking / Merge A Vessel A Harbour / I Will Never See The Sun / This Is Not Like Home / The Animals Of The World / Faithful Night Listening / Three Days At Sea - Three Lost Years / Great Lake Swimmers
3,It's O.K.,"It was a decent story and main characters were likable; but sub-characters such as the mother and the sister's personalities were more inconsistent without much explanations, fortunately, they were only secondary characters. I did enjoy reading the ""drunken-scene"" towards end of the book, I thought it was funny and strategic, but I did not like the book cover; it was obvious that the artist either did not have a clue what the heroine looked like or had a misunderstanding with the publisher, for the heroine was a dark-haired lady and not a blond. Otherwise, I managed to finish the whole book without skipping much."
4,Enjoyable and sweet,"I enjoyed this book. It had a good plot, the character's were likeable, except the villain, and it was worth opening up and spending some time reading. It wasn't the greatest romance novel ever, but it was more than OK."
3,A Promising Predicament,"With dainty fists clenched and dark eyes ablaze, Miss Rosalys Larrimer gathered the skirts of her twice-mended frock and stormed out of the parlor in a tizzy. Poor Rosalys could not believe the note just read to her and her sister Daphne. A promissory note it was, drawn up between the late Duke of Kedwell and her own father - but what it promiseed was a marriage contract between their children! Although its signatories long ago had a falling-out, Lady Larrimer would see to it that the aged note was honored. After all, a match between Daphne and Connor St. Cyr would save Larrimer House from foreclosure. Spirited Rosalys was outraged. Her sister, wed with neither dowry nor fortune, would be humiliated. Worse yet, despite St. Cyr's impressive demeanor, his lordship was a socially graceless, clumsy bumpkin. But Rosalys never dreamed that there was method to his lordship's rustic madness...and that that dreary note of days past helt the key to her own bright future."
3,Significantly below their debut,"I have read several glowing reviews, and I am with the few others on Amazon that regard this sophomore effort as a disappointment. The mix is a bit unusual. The hard rock of the first CD is more power metal on this CD, but I am not bothered by the change. I think that the quality of the songwriting is inferior. Aeronautics starts with a real bang: Crimson Rider, Back For My Life, Wounds, and I'm Not Afraid (the first four songs) give you the impression that this album could contend with the top CDs of the year. The quality dips a tad with Headbanger's Ballroom, then nosedives with the next three songs. Falling Sparrow has a catchy chorus and the last song Black in the Burn feels too long at over 8 minutes."
2,Disappointing - makes the debut album look like a masterpiece,"Truly disappointing follow up to a strong debut. While IMO Masterplan's debut album wasn't a masterpiece, it was strong, melodic, hard, varying and contained some truly amazing tracks. 'Aeronautics' is very predictable, less melodic, more metal (mostly due to lot's of double-bass drumming) and uninspired concerning songwriting and lyrics. Even Jorn's vocals which were truly great on the debut album sound weak, bored and kind of buried in the mix. The lyrics also try too hard to be radio friendly and catchy and thus fail. There are of course some noteworthy songs such as 'Crimson Rider', 'Wounds' and 'Back In The Burn' but nothing mind blowing. All in all much weaker compared to it's predecessor on all aspects including production. No wonder why Jorn and Uli left the band after this release..."
3,"Pretty, but tight and scratchy","Though the sweater is beautiful, it runs small and scratches like wool. The attached scarf cannot be removed without intensive sewing. (Thought I'd mention it in case you had the same idea I did.) If you can get past these problems, it is a lovely sweater."
2,Disappointed,"I didn't think I was going to able to get into this book. It was a boring beginning, and didn't get much better. I am a great fan of scotland historical novels, but this one was a great disappointment. I was really looking forward to reading the whole series, but for me, that's not going to happen. It was enough to get through the first one."
2,Less than Compelling,"I may be in the minority, but try as I might, I couldn't get into this book. I found the writing less than compelling, mainly awkward, and the Christan undertones, or actually overtones, didn't move me emotionally."
5,Great Debut!,The first book in the Scottish Crown Series is great. The story is very touching and exciting.Bravo!
4,Great book for a beginning,"Gwenyth is betrothed to Robert the Bruce's enemy, and seeks to be reunited with him when she is captured and raped. She is then forced to marry Adam Mackintosh rather than see him killed for the purported rape.Adam is dealing with his own feelings of inadequacy and other problems of assuming the lairdship of the Mackintoshes when his father dies. The last thing he needs is a wife. THe only thing is---he doesn't know her true identity.The pages that follow take the reader on a journey into the life of nobles in 1300s Scotland as it is battling for its independence from England.I can't wait until the next book."
3,Not a reread,I was an ok book. The characters were not developed very well. It was a good story but I would probably not read it again.
3,Love story??,"This is a nicely written love story, appropriately and tastfully done. The motivational intricacies seem logical and are reflected of the thinking of the day. However, I see this as fiction, not historical fiction. As fiction, this romance should be rated high it is so nicely crafted; but as historical fiction it doesn't interplay well. There is not much to the political story when it could be enriched and exciting. My recommendation is that the reader enjoy it as a romance novel and not historical fiction, then they would not be disappointed at all."
5,BEAUTIFUL story,"I was so excited to read this book, and it did NOT disappoint. It's a beautiful historical christian romance. Mysteries and betrayal weaved into a compelling story of healing and love. The history is accurate, the romance that will heal both main characters is developed slowly and sweetly, and the religion is a nice touch to such a rough background. I have the other three books from this series on my desk and I can't wait to read them if they're anything like this one."
1,The Wings over vietnam disk came scratched andthe computer cant read it,"I ordered this think $6.00 what a deal, but then WOV came and the disk was dirty and scratched...........and its a new product. The computer couldnt even read the disk because of all the scratches."
2,Wings over Vietnam,"For the most part this was a great product, unfortunately the flight patterns of the AI are so erratic that the game becomes nearly unplayable. In every instance it seemed that the AI pilot deliberatly set up for maximal deflection, making the geometry completely untenable. Of course that may be that I didn't put enough hours in on it, but I'm spoiled by Falcon 4.0 : )Graphics: Awesome.Stability: Awesome.Modabiltiy: Very Good.Concept: Awesome.Campaign: Acceptable (no real ground attack in historical context).Actual Gameplay: Annoying."
2,Not all that hot,"Not all that crazy about it. Same goes for the next one, Wings over Europe. Of all the flight sims I have, the only one I truly enjoy is Microsoft's Flight Simulator Deluxe, and the accelerator makes it truly awesome."
2,not fun .....poor running game...,this game is poor....if you a person who expecks a game that says your system meets the requierments on the box...then when you get it home and play the game with the latest patch ...it keeps on leaving the game during play ...saying wings over vietnam has encountered a probelm every mission...kicks you back to your desktop... i make my attack on anti-air craft guns.....thier are too many of these in the game with unrealistic ranges ....like a soldier on a fixed machine gun 9.5 miles aways that can shoot at you and blow up your plane ....i find myself falling asleep during the game because the missions are too long to reach the target...then you have these anti-aircraft guns that don't blow up after direct hits with everything you got...when you take off in 3rd person the games camera goes crazy back and fourth left and right ...i knew when this happen i was dealing with a crappy game ...
1,the worst I ever played,"I didne't like this. I got it at best buy and I coulden't wait to put it in to my computer. When I put it in I got my wingman joystick and started playing. The joystick didne't even work ( it wasne't the joystick that wasne't working, it was the game.) It started to freeze. It didne't have good graphics. don't get it. Your going to waste your money."
1,Waste of money !!!,"Don't waste your time or money. Can't even load it in any of my 3, thats right 3, of my XP machines. The only place this thing loaded was into was my trash can. You get what you pay for."
4,disappointment now full enjoyment,Had problems loading it but now-----Okay so now I finally go it loaded with the 2008 patch and it is great. Thoroughly enjoy it.
4,Super flight sim....needs better manual.,"The graphics and gameplay for this one are great. The flight model really seems to have the 'ring of truth'. Very good in terms of options to ""fine tune"" the difficulty of the game to suit individual tastes. Only complaint is the manual...not enough info in terms of advice on how to successfully complete mission with the aircraft/weapons in the game (e.g., how to employ air-to-ground ordnance effectively in an F-4)."
4,FUN,"Very fun game. A little old compared to the newer flight sims, but the graphics are really good, almost great and the gameplay is really fun. If you are looking for a not so complicated flight sim that you can just get into the air and start flying, killing stuff and having fun, then this is the perfect game."
1,WoV,"""Cannot authenticate original disc within the time allotted"" is the message shown after install. Too bad it does not work."
4,GREAT GAME!!!!,"BEST AND MOST REALISTIC VIETNAM FLIGHT SIM ON THE MARKETTONS OF PLANES, WEPON LAYOUTS, AND MISSIONS YOU CAN'T GO WRONG.GROUND TARGETING IS VERY DIFFCULT TO DO BUT ALL-IN-ALL A MUST FOR ANY JET FIGHTER FAN."
1,Suspect pirated software,Program would not run. Error said it could not validate disk in alloted time frame. Tried download on two different Windows XP machine and received same error. Program was very inexpensive. Would be happy to pay for real thing. Disk had came in paper wrapper with no security measures what so ever. Bought it straight through amazon.com instead of trying to find cheaper vendor. Very dissappointed.
1,Disappointing.,"It would of been nice to know that this does not work for Windows 7. I tried everything, even ran it in compatibility mode for old Windows Operating Systems. It was only 8 dollars, but it felt wasted to me. It would be nice for it to be said somewhere that this does not work on newer Operating Systems. Of course, you could always build a virtual machine with Windows XP, but that almost defeats the purpose."
1,A review is a review....,"I will not apologize for anyone taking offense to my review about this book.Simply put, I expected more and it just didn't live up to my personal expectations. So, I stand by my opinion. Mr. Dilcher although amusing, I'm a bit too mature to engage in the puerile game of ""I Challenge You"". As far as boasting about the Numismatic award, I congratulate the author on the recognition. However, let's be honest and let's keep it real according to the latest Numismatic Literary Guild (NLG v37 II, pg 3)newsletter the body that bestows that award consists of individuals completely ""outside"" of the numismatic professional field. Again this is my review and I stand by it."
1,"Great pictures, but a lack-luster of a read...","I read the book painstakinly cover to cover and must say the pictures are nice but the book is not worth the price.Most of the information found in this book is information I have read in other periodicals, journals, and publications.The book tries to cover too many ""facts"" yet not enough depth to give you the impression the author did due diligence in his research. Rather I felt he was just compiling information from other sources. In my opinon the book is a disappointing work on such a rich topic. Very disappointing."
3,Not what was expected,"Not the strongest of Lucchesi's books - I expected the counter attacking to be a discussion of how to implement explosions from the back up to the front, ala the 80's German national teams that were able to go from defending in front of their nets to producing a shot on net in 6 passes or less. Instead you get a lot of discussion of how different tactical set-ups match up against each other which is really kind of esoteric. Soccer is not a scientific endeavor like American football or basketball. The proper title of this book should have been ""Counter-actions"" not counter attacking, and while it is an interesting read, all things being equal the info in this book will have little practicality to most coaches, even higher level ones."
1,SHODDY PIECE OF CRUD!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a HORRIBLE Supersoaker. The first day I tried it out, my ""Quick-Fill Cap"" (more like ""More-Leaks Cap!) started leaking after just ONE pump. I had to throw it away because the box was thrown away when I got it for Easter. Super Soakers just keep breaking! Now I dont have any water guns and I am extremely upset!! BUYERS BEWARE, buy this if you really want, but keep the box and reciept, cause you might end up having to take it back!!!!!!!"
4,I'ts quite good,This is not a bad water gun. I purchased because it looks like the rocket launcher of ut2004. It has three settings. Normal - this setting shoots about 11m far for about 9 seconds. Wide shoots just about as far but then just for 1 second! This is because it unloads 207 ml in that sec. And the fan is pretty good. It lasts around 6 sec. Overall this gun is good but is just empty quite quikly.p.s. I'm from the Netherlands so maybe my English was not to good.
3,Pretty Good,"I just bought this thing yesterday it is pretty good here are some of the up's and down's of the thingUp's The three different blasting mode's, the quick fill cap and the portiblilty.Downs Bad range my big CPS has way better range. Tank is too small so if you use wide stream you'll run out of water fast. Bad Pump doesn't really presurize it that well. And the Fan mode doesn't really work.Overal I gave this Super Soaker three stars because of its Portibility so if your going to a park or beach and don't want to drag along a huge CPS like I've got this would be a good choice."
1,Little Pip Squeek,"The TRIPLE SHOT is a very small gun just like something my neighber has. But his is a small squirt gun this is a small super soaker. The TRIPLE SHOT has three different settings fat, skinny and small round. The best one is the fat one. The problem with this gun is that it doesnt hold alot of water and it squirts uncunt rolably sometines. Overal this little bugger isnt that bad. Only if your apponents dont have big guns. Like the FLASH FLOOD, ARCTIC SHOCK and AQUAPACK DEVASTATOR then you would be triple teamed and you'd loose."
2,Another one of hasbros scams. Stick with aquapack or ebay water guns if you want something decent.,"This gun has weak range, shot capacity, and water capacity. Too weak to even be a side-arm. Dont bother with this one."
2,great idea if it didnt break,I bought this product and within a week it has broken. The pump no longer keeps the pressure. Of course I have already thrown away the packaging as well... To bad I didnt read reviews from other sites that say not to pump it up to much. I would stay away from this product.
1,How not to get screwed,"This product had a bad leakage problem from day one. I notified Amazon that I wished to return it and was told to print off a label for the return which I did. Amazon chose to send the replacement item BEFORE the other one was returned. Now I get an EMail saying the inferior item was never received even though I mailed it back 2 days before receiving the replacement item. Amazon is threatening to rebill my credit card for the first inferior item if it is not received. I have instucted Amazon NOT to do this because I returned the item and rebilling my credit card would be unauthorized use of my credit card and that is illegal. Also I have been a very good customer of Amazon and if this happens, I will no longer purchase anything from Amazon. I cannot help it if the inferior item was not received."
3,The Hills Have Eyes,"A vacationing family is in an area where a relative left them some land,that they used to mine for silver.A local man trys to persuade them to stick to the main road,and forget about the land.Of course the family doesn't listen,and they have a wreck.Soon the guys of the family walk the land to look for help,they'll find someone,but when they do they will wish that they hadn't.A family of freaks,Jupitor,and Pluto and a couple more kill whoever happens to go onto their territory.The family is pitted up against the freaks,to try to survive.Not overly great entertainment,but not as bad as it could be.The movie was cheaply made,and the blood looks extremely fake.If you want something different this it.The movie is probable most notable for being directed by Wes Craven,and future star Dee Wallace Stone(E.T.,Critters,The Howling)."
2,A Terrible Classic,"This is a genuinely bad movie that only true horror buffs will appreciate. It's definitely a classic of the genre, but that doesn't mean it's not a turd. A classic turd is still a turd.Bad actors, bad dialogue, bad pacing, bad music, bad production values, bad direction, just...plain...bad..."
2,And the point is?,"I know this is an early slasher film, but I don't see a point to it. The plot is absurd. The dialogue is awful. The acting is abysmal. The soundtrack is very bad. And the gore really isn't very gory by today's standards. There is no redeeming social value here. I had to pause it about 10 times over four days to get through it, 20 minutes at a time. If you're fan of Wes Craven, you will love it. Others may be bored, though not repulsed."
1,1 star out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The Hills Have Eyes takes place in a desert where no one is hot or thirsty, features characters who have absolutely no personality, and an conclusion that basically just ends; why watch this abyssmal film when you could watch Last House on the Left, for early Craven, or Straw Dogs, for ""my home is my castle"" thrills?"
3,Freaks,okay so i just watched the remake of this the other day and i must say...rent it because it is pretty much exactly like the first one....all the people look the same exept for the cannibals. they are like freak mutants or something. but yes this is a good movie. if you havent seen this one then i would suggeest that u go and watch the new one but if you have seen it...again rent the new one when it comes out.toodles.
1,Boring,I watched this movie for 20 minutes until I turned it off. It was boring and going nowhere. The characters were uninteresting and the movie took too long to set up. I'm glad I didn't waste money to rent this.
2,A DVD zone DELIVERANCE,"It has often been said that if you have interesting mean guys, your movie can't be entirely bad. It's the case with Wes Craven's THE HILLS HAVE EYES, a film presented by Anchor Bay in a special and definitive edition. If one isn't concerned at all by the fate reserved to most of the members of the politically correct Carter family, each of the appearances of Pluto, Jupiter or another member of this degenerate family is rather surprising if not frightening.The only problem is that the theme of THE HILLS HAVE EYES had already be magistrally treated by John Boorman 5 years before in DELIVERANCE. And that there wasn't anything to add to that masterpiece. So Wes Craven's movie suffers a lot from this comparison and if it wasn't for the quality of the acting of Michael Berryman, the film wouldn't deserve any attention."
5,What do you do...?,"This movie was amazing. I liked every second of it until thee end. But this movie is a NO HOLDS BAR, IN YOUR FACE, SOCK IT TO ME movie. If you understand that then you won't hesitate to buy it this very second. No mercey in this movie and i love it!"
1,I guess it takes a die-hard craven fan,"Low budget horror can be done well, but this film was simply awful. The characters are neither believable nor scary. The acting is pitiful and the dialogue is preposterous. It isn't even laughably bad, just plain boring and annoying. You'll look across the sofa at your friend/partner and say, ""What the heck is this, and why all the hype?""One thing does recommend the DVD version, however: The follow-up, modern day interviews with Craven, the Producer, and the cast. For the first ten minutes I had to ask myself whether they were serious in their praise and awe of this trash, or they were doing an Academy Award deserving spoof. After 20 jaw dropping minutes you'll know which."
1,gouge my eyes,"I was thrilled upon finding a ""new"" blu-ray version of this classic was available for public consumption.Watching the first five minutes of said classic made me want to gouge my eyes out.This is NOT hi-definition.As a matter of fact after a close comparison of this ""new and improved"" copy with my old dvd copy it clearly shows no difference at all to my poor mistreated eyes.My wallet,along with my eyes,was also abused by this product and I am currently in the process of trying to return said $12.99 to the very same wallet.Avoid this product like the plague!!!Save your money and watch your already worn dvd copy."
1,Another crappy DVD upscale.,The happiness was great when I noticed that this film was to be released on Blu Ray.The dissapointment was enormous when the first screenshots from it were found.I will NOT spend any money on an upscaled dvd.Hope there will be a better release of this movie soon.
4,A real view of 70's horror,"It had to be scary and nasty for the people who saw it when it came out on the seventy and show a piece of what Wes Craven path was going to be. It has all the elements of the classical slasher, the gore(even as it look really fake you have to give them credit it was the 70's there was no CGI), the tension. the story is simple and to the point. family goes to dream vacation, family found weird guy attending gas station, weird guy gives directions for a shortcut, gullible family takes direction, family has accident and it is stuck on the desert, canibalistic mutants find family, some family memebers die, family retaliates, some mutants die, cast & credits. Anyway is a good addition to y horror movies collection"
2,Don't care for the genre,"If you like horror, then by all means ignore me. I don't like it, I found every character here annoying and not worth caring whether they lived or not."
1,"Wes Craven's The Hills have Eyes (The Original,1977)","Wes Craven has made a bizarre and a creepy but not very scary movie here,Compared to the Remake,this movie is like bambi.Worth Seeing and comparing the two films(skip part 2,see original and remake).the remake is more scarier and very violent."
1,"dumb,can't even compare with the texas chainsaw massacre","For people who havn't seen this movie and are thinking of renting or buying this movie,DON'T!!!!!It is not scary or macrbe or anything.People who say this movie is better than the texas chainsaw massacre are dumb!!!!!This is only one of the low works by Wes craven.His other low works are ""they"" which is positivly,absolutly,horribly,stupid!!!!!"
4,The hills have eyes (1977 release),"If I remember correctly, I saw this movie at the theatre when I was a child. It seemed very creepy and I still remember a few of the scenes. However, I cannot say (with 100 percernt certainly) that I am thinking of the same movie since I cannot view any photographs or trailers on-line. However, based on the plot description, this seems to be it. I'd really like to know for sure. Can anyone tell me where to go to view a trailor - or at least some still images of the actual movie. All I can see if the cover of the DVD and it is not helpful."
4,Solid low budget work from Craven,"First off I like the new remake better than the original, hated cravens part two, (Just way to many flashbacks to the first film), and kind of like the remakes' #2, although it's much lower quality than the remake itself. Whoa that's a lot of info before the review even begins, let's keep this short. Cool dogs, cool Mutant killers, good desert setting, and a 70's level of violence, that gets the job done...3 Stars could have used a lot more sex & NUDITY to go with the violence..."
5,Hills Have Eyes Movie,"This movie is great. I have been looking for this,, the original,, for awhile. The re-make was not nearly as good as this movie !!!! Great to watch for a scarey night.."
1,Well at least the title menu is in Full HD,"Wes Craven is the man, but if you like your blu-rays to look better than a VHS skip this release. This IMAGE Midnight Madness line has been putting VHS quality rips on blu ray. Don't buy it, wait for a real studio 1080p HD release. Funny thing is they actually had the nerve to put the title menu in Full HD. The special features are garbage; the included alternate ending looked like it was upscaled from a laser disc."
2,Overrated Mess,"Family gets stranded in a dessert out in the middle of nowhere with rock hills, deformed cannibalistic cavemen looking people that live in those hills stalk and prey on those innocent vicitims. Very low budget, bad makeup design, I guess every director has to start somewhere and after the succesful a nightmare on elm street that made director wes craven a big name in hollywood in the 80s, it seems his early film work is kinda amatureish, shakey direction, dull writing and weak dialogue, not even scary, kinda boring, he has sharpened his skills and has improved his craft after this film. probably wes cravens worst films I've seen."
5,An underrated metal maelstrom,"If this album would have gotten as much radio sponsorship as Ozzy or Metalli-can't they would have been superstars, I think. No real weak tracks, a definitive 80's metal album at it's best. Every song has something unique, either a real eye-opening solo or riff or both or something else to do with drums. Funny metal lyrics too, like what you'd expect from Judas Priest. Color/texture changes from song to song and within a song itself. You're caught off guard just when you anticipate what's going to happen next. This one's perfect for the loudspeakers."
5,Charming on several levels,"My 2-year-old loves all the stories in thisseries. The stories are simple and charming,the illustrations are fun."
5,OUTSTANDING!,"Quite an excellent book. Doherty perfectly intermingles the pilgrim's conversations with the story told by the franklin. A page-turner and nearly impossible to put it down; I read it in two days! This book has all the classic murder mystery parts: death, sex, intrique, romance, and for those medieval fans, knights, ladies, verderers, castles, and of course those pilgrims. A five out of five stars!"
1,Ruined,"When did the rooster on the box get a cartoony face? Whatever happened to that wonderful abstraction? First they ruined Tony the Tiger, now this.And where did all the high fructose corn syrup come from? Admittedly, it is a flake of corn but that is a nasty ingredient to be skipped at all costs.It's things like that which drive people to the formerly odd grains like spelt and kamut!"
5,Wonderful Music,"Listening to this Cd with my wife she identified: an organ, a recorder, and at least one string instrument. The music is haunting and upolifting. What more to say?"
4,Exhaustive and extensive,"Lhabitant positions this as an introduction to quantitative techniques. As Mark Anson notes in his foreword, it is a difficult, near impossible task to make this easy...and Francois does his best.If you are outside the industry (a non-financial person trying to learn about hedge funds) I would suggest you start out with something easier like, Hedge Funds for Dummies, otherwise you'll be in way over your head. This is not a book that will give you the basics about hedge funds. This is a book for people who want to obtain their CAIA, finance MBAs, or people in the industry."
3,"Great features, plastic clip breaks.","I love this case... but.I got This case because it had the features I wanted. I used it for a couple of months. The case was great. It even seemed to be higher quality construction than the last one I got. The only problem (and this is why it got 3 stars) is that the clip broke on me after about 3 months. I superglued it the first time, and then it broke in a different spot where it couldn't be fixed. The clip is removable and the pin that holds the removable clip in place is what broke the first time. That wasn't a big deal because I only use it as a holster, so I superglued the clip in place. Then the ring that holds the case in the belt clip itself broke off. I tried gluing it, but it broke again after a day. It's over for this case. It's a shame, because it's really nice and the leather is great. If you just want a case and won't be using it as a belt clip/holster, this is a wonderful choice. Just look elsewhere if you need it at your side."
4,very interesting......,"Very inspirational, now that he is a teen idol it's good he can still have his story out there. I found the title very interesting, because even if someone doesn't survive in their hearts they do and that's what really matters. I hope Michael lives a long life and I wish him the best."
5,The best book ever! ; ),I loved the book and just recently got it.It was the best book I have ever read and i would recomend it to everyone.It was a sad story but it is also an inspiring book for anyone experiencing it. It made me both laugh and cry.He was a very strong person while going through this and I found it very astonishing that he had to go through all of this and I was extremely devistated when I recently heard of his tragic passing.I will miss him soooo much and I give my deepest sympathy to his friends and family.I wish he could have another chance so that I could actually meet him. :(
5,It's a lifesaver,"I have a Chevy Impala. The trunk is huge and the backseat is ample; so, I have no trouble putting the Rollator into the car. It's light-weight, so I have no trouble lifting it. And, I'm a Senior Citizen with spinal, shoulder and knee problems. It enables me to do more things with friends and family and to get out and about for longer periods of time. The ability to sit whenever I need to is an answer to my prayers. Also, it's well-built; so, it provides great support while walking. It's the second one I bought. The first one was the largest size. That model is a little tougher to handle.."
5,The Merriam-Webster Thesaurus,"This book is well formatted. It is easy reading, informative and enjoyable. I highly recommend it to writers and researchers of all levels."
1,Not really for kids,"This book isn't exactly for younger kids -- it's far too scary for little ones, and doesn't really give them any context.It ""warns"" kids of the danger of lightning by saying that it can start your house on fire, and that it kills cows and horses and people. And that if there is a storm, they should stay away from TVs, bathtubs, sinks, phones, wires, and pipes, because they all carry lightning into the house. And the way it's presented, it makes it seem like those things are all pretty much guaranteed during a storm (but also tells kids to get inside immediately during a storm, because otherwise they're at risk of getting struck by lightning).So, if you want your youngster to be terrified of lightning, by all means, read this book to them. I'd probably skip this one."
5,Fun and educational,A fun way to look at the weather. I read it hundreds of times as a child and will read it to my daughter
5,A Must Have,"Collective Soul have been pumping out beautiful music for over 10 years now and it doesn't look like they'll be stopping anytime soon. From The Ground Up, is full of intimate acoustic songs that will sure to become fan favorites. It's such a treat for diehard fans to hear Collective Soul's old hits and some new ones from Youth in such a beautifully done acoustic format. This album is sure to help the band pick up some new fans aswell. I command you to pick up this awesome EP."
5,great cd,"This cd is pretty good. Mellow, and reminds me of their concerts. They did some different takes on some classic CS songs. I would reccommend this to anyone, especially collective soul fans. Enjoy!"
4,A Good Album...But Not Their Best,"I don't suppose it matters much but I'll start by clarifying that the tracking on the CD version of this album is incorrect. The ""First Door"" actually takes up the first two tracks (There is no untitled fourteenth track). If you read the descriptions of the pieces in the inlay of the CD, my alternate tracking will make more sense. Overall, my favorite pieces on this album are the First (tracks 1 & 2) and Fifth Doors (track 6) and especially ""Toota Lute"" (track 13). ""Toota Lute"" reminds me of something that the great Bach would probably have concieved. Perhaps this album is less pleasing than some of it's counterparts. I must admit that Fresh Aire I is one of my favorite albums of all time. This album only hints at it's predecessor. Overall, this album is worth buying for it's ""Classic Steamroller"" quality."
4,"Along with FA 4, My Favorite","This album is more thematically organized than any of the first 4 albums.The first side ""Fantasia"" essentially repeats a simple theme in different variations, from pastoral to high energy synth rock.The second half of this album ""Interlude V, Toota Lute"" is very atmospheric and more in character with the other Fresh Aire albums 1-4. It winds up with the Steamroller's signature piece ""Going to Another Place,"" which restates the theme explored in ""Fantasia.""I'm a big fan of the first 4 Fresh Aire albums. However, I think they kind of lost it starting with FA 5 when the concepts behind the albums were too grand, and adding an entire orchestra and choral group created monstrous, boring arrangements that bogged down Chip Davis' melodies.You won't find that here. Simple arrangements and excellent production and recording make this Fresh Aire one of my favorites."
4,Great Product,"This product was really great. It came calibrated, but it also csme with a 100gram weight to calibrate at any time. It definitely is a pocket sized scale. It is about the size of my hand. It performs how I need it to, and so I would definitely recommend it."
3,Not bad,Did not ship with calibration weight... Which really sucks..But it seems to be calibrated and somewhat accurate.All the Nickels I tested weighed between 4.7 and 5.0 grams exactly.. So not too shabby.
2,I'd stay away,"This little scale seemed to be an awsome deal with the price and all, but after about 4 or 5 times using it, it started to be off by a couple .1g. This is not what you want in a scale. Accuracy is the key and this scale disappoints in that department."
1,Not much of an adventure,"This was one of the first non-Doyle Holmes stories that I picked up to read, and I was quite disappointed. The plot is thin, and Andrews tries to capture the spark of the Watson-Holmes relationship without much success. Frankly, I think the book is somewhat boring. Since this book I have found numerous other non-Doyle stories that are very good."
4,Great music,Purchased this CD for my husband for Christmas. He loved it and we both enjoy listening to it. Thank you!
5,Great way to make quick omelets,What a great addition to the George Foreman grill plate collection.Excellent way to make a quick omelet and easy to clean up!Perfect size for portion control also.
5,Exactly what we needed. Works with the evolve,"The picture shows one plate, but it actually comes with both a top and bottom. Also, it works with my George Foreman Evolve."
3,"They work fine, but not really necessary.","Got these at the same time I bought the grill. With the additional amazon $25 discount for spending $125, it seemed like a good idea.However, after making omelets in both the Omelet Plates, and the Baking Plates, I prefer the latter. I like my omelet folded, with the cheese and other fixings in the middle. With the Omelet Plates, you place the eggs and other fixings in the oval indentations. While cooking, it puffs up considerably. You then sprinkle cheese on top after it is done. It tastes fine.I would wait until you have used the basic plates before you decide you need the Omelet Plates."
3,strange eggs,This addition to the grill makes great pocket sandwiches. Easy to Clean!!The omlets come out really strange and not well cooked in the middle.
1,Egg on my face,"This is really not an omelet maker. After you cook the egg, you have to lay the cheese on top. Not impressed, would not have purchsed if I had better insight or information on this product."
3,"Foreman's Grill Good, but the omelet plate,","I really like the George Foreman grill, but the omelet plates are not deep enough. Everything spills over. I wish they had made a plate that mimics the sandwich makers, I don't use this plate very much."
1,Necessary?,"I'm kind of sorry I spent the extra $ to buy this, since it is very specialized and not that useful. You can do better and faster omelets with your omelet pan."
2,Not the best ending for McQueen's career.,"Steve McQueen plays Papa Thorson a man who lives in the past with the motto ""New things are no Good."" Papa's a bounty hunter who relies on a law from the late1800's that allows anyone to capture those who jump bail (by almost any means necessary).Most of the movie shows Papa tracking down and capturing criminals. There are some wacky chase scenes -- one involving a Trans Am and a Harvester in a corn field - but most the action is mundane especially compared to McQueen's other films.The movie would have benefited greatly with better effects (explosions, etc), some one liners and stronger characterization. The ending is somewhat sentimental and cheesy. The film is based on a true story - which probably could have used some embellishment. McQueen gives a pretty good performance and it's fun to see Levar Burton in one of his earlier roles. Recommended for hard-core McQueen fans only."
3,McQueen Out,"McQueen's last picture is this serviceable 80s action yarn. It's best when he's out on the street, less effective in the set-bound interiors, including Steve's seemingly cavernous L.A. bungalow. There are two terrific action set pieces. One's a chase on the Chicago el, and earlier there's a cornfield contest between a Trans-Am and a reaper that eats up the corn in an image that seems to predict Pac Man. (You could watch it for hours.) The amusing comic conceit is that speed-demon McQueen (in an awesome jacket) is a bad driver lumbering around in an antique ride he's incapable of parallel parking. (Less amusing are his drunken complaints that his ravishing, pregnant girlfriend didn't abort the child they're expecting at any minute.)"
3,Entertaining in places,"The pursuit scenes in this PI-genre flick were creative and riveting. The filler between them seemed mundane. The characters were believable, for the most part - tho LeVar Buton seemed to be reading his lines, and why Katheryn Harrold was attracted to McQueen's character escaped me. The ending was a little sappy (boy gets girl and newborn, as people cheer). We're left to wonder if his character would strive for more meaning in life as a new (unmarried)Dad. Im not looking for a sequel..."
1,wrong version,wrong version for my region would not play i have returned it I could not get to play am waiting for it to be replaced
1,Does Not Play as only presents an ERROR,It is marked region 2 and displays an error when I try to play it. What must be done to remove the region2?
4,Papa Thorson,I agree with all reviews which seem to indicate the middle of the road. I like it a little more because it was filmed in Chicago. A good movie from a great actor.
3,Not bad considering...Steve McQueen's last (R.I.P.),"Based on real life 'last-of-the-bounty-hunters', Ralph 'Papa'Thorsen, who appears in here asbartender (shades of Don Siegelin 'Play Misty For Me' w/ Clint!).Kathrine Harold is better in here(even pregnant!) than 'Ahrnuld'in Raw Deal. McQueen does prettywell considering he went to Mexicoright after this wrapped to get moreAnti-Establishment/Holistic Cancertreatments. But unfortunately hedied on the operating table of aheart attack, which is exactly howmy grandfather (dad's side) went.So sad. But he left us with a very'fine filmography to remember him by."
4,Happy Hunter,This is a classic Steve McQueen type movie. He plays the tough guy with the soft side. This was his last movie and one not to be missed. I have quite the collection and this rates in the top 4 of his work.
3,"Great McQueen, so-so movie","Steve McQueen was desperately ill with lung cancer at the time that ""The Hunter"" was released, but he looks like his old self throughout this rather mediocre action film. McQueen, however, is excellent in his final role, and his performance makes this otherwise so-so film worth seeing."
2,Mildly entertaining but not a must-see,"I love the classic McQueen films like Bullit and The Great Escape. This film is not in the same league and is frankly a bit silly, although it has some good moments (especially the Trans Am cornfield car chase) and a little light humor too. One of the worst aspects is the lack of any background character development regarding the psychotic killer after McQueen. Who is he? Why does he hate Papa Thornson? What is with the war paint on his face? There are no answers to any of these questions. I also found the score to be very cheesy. It sounds like the music from a Brady Bunch episode. Finally, I found the killing of an innocent bystander during one chase to be too cavalier, with no sense of regret on the part of the hero. All in all it is a poorly written and directed script."
1,"a sad goodbye to the ""king of cool""","this was steve mcqueen's last film and that is sad as this is not even able to be called an action movie or a comedy. this mess is ""based on the true story"" of bounty hunter ralph ""papa"" thorson and it just never gels into and kind of film at all. not the way to say goodbye to the great steve mcqueen, get bulliet or the sand pebbles instead"
1,PU,"Most reviewers blasted this film when it came out and for once the critics were right. It's so terrible it has a kind of fascination to it as you watch this assortment of fine actors trying to bring some life to a script of pure claptrap. Perhaps McQueen's judgment was clouded by the onset of his mortal illness when he ok'd it. He couldn't have been feeling very well and his discomfort is palpable. Allegedly and laughably based on the life of bounty-hunter Ralph Thorson, it's an idiotic mix of domestic whinery and crook-catching that should have been played for straight comedy. Then we'd have had a happier finale from this great actor."
1,DVD purchase,"I am stationed in Iraq and recently purchased The Hunter(Steve McQueen) through Amazon and when I received it and went to play it, the disk started skipping. I guess this gives me the opportunity to ask what I can do, if anything to return the DVD and get it replaced. My DVD player is new and I have since watched a couple of other new DVDs in it with no problem. I have made other purchases through Amazon, but this was a really disappointing experience."
1,This unit is a piece of junk!!!,This item worked for the first year and then I could not get it to communicate between the transmitter and receiver unit....all I got was just a bunch of dashes on the receiver unit. Tried fresh batteries and everything suggested in the manual. Decide to call LaCrosse Technologies for assistance....spoke to a supervisor who guided me through some other attempts not listed in the manual to try and get it to communicate between transmitter and receiver....after all this she said that I would have to send it back to them for repair. Absolutely ridiculous suggestion to send back a $25.00 item from Canada to the USA for repair. I told her I would suggest to all friends and people everywhere....NOT TO BUY ANY JUNK from LaCrosse Technologies. Because that is what it is JUNK!!!
4,How much rain?,Great to know how much rain without going outside. Nice large display. Would not be without it. Can also be mounted on the fence.
1,La Crosse Tech. WS-9004U Wireless Rain Center,This is the 4th unite purchased and 3 had failure from start. One worked. They depend on new batteries to work as indicated in instructions.
1,stopped working after a week,This unit set up easily and worked fine for about a week then lost connection. I still need to bring in the outside unit to check it but hard to do when it's raining a lot like now.
1,junk!,"Received this as a gift. Never could get it working and they've made it difficult to return (why should I have to pay for shipping on your piece of junk equipment, La Crosse ""Technology"" ???).With all the negative reviews this thing has gotten it obviously has some quality control issues."
1,Never Worked,This rain guage never worked right out of the box. I installed the batteries into the two units and got nothing but dashed lines on the display. I thought that I finally got it to work and I installed the unit outside and the first rain it registered nothing. Would not purchase ever again.
1,Don't buy this item!,This item does not work. I had an old style rain gauge right next to it. The electronic one said no rain. The old fashion rain gauge had 4/10ths in it. i highly recommend that you don't buy this item. (And it was setup exactly to the enclosed instructions)
1,Very Disappointed,"I'm very disappointed in this rain gauge. As has been stated, it's a huge pain to set up after every little thing happens. The two units are only 10 feet apart, direct line of sight through a thermopane window, it still loses contact constantly. Then I have to take them both apart, remove the batteries, and go through the whole deal of set up each time. Until it was 6 months old, when it stopped working altogether. Lacrosse should be ashamed to put their name on this junk."
1,Not up to Amazon standards,"I bought the `electronic` rain guage from Amazon.com (rather than UK) and the product eventually made its way across the Atlantic. Sadly, despite it saying in the Instructions that it shouldn`t be relied upon for total accuracy, it wasn`t accurate at all - it under registered each rainfall event and the indoor component didn`t display all the symbols that it should have."
1,Barry,Bought this unit in May of 2009. It worked perfectly for about a Year today It quit working.Installed new batteries in both units works when both Units are next to one another but when moved to It's existing outside location just dash lines.
2,Three have Failed,"I bought three of these for Christmas Gifts, they have all failed with the first year."
1,Batting .500,"Bought two La Crosse ws-9004u rain gauges,one works one does not. Heck, one out of two aint bad!!! Cheap price cheap product."
2,Poor,The box containing the electronics and batteries is very cheap and won't stay latched down on one end. I had to use some tape. Would I buy this product again? NO! Would I recommend it to someone? NO!
1,"Worst Product Ever, Total Waste of Money! Don't Buy It!!","I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. Due to it arriving in winter, my husband was not able to set it up until spring (when the return time frame had ended). He was never able to get a signal at the receiver in spite of hours of varying the placement of the sensor. I wish I had read the other unfavorable reviews prior to purchase, as I never would have bought it. I gave this product 1 star as I was unable to to change the rating to a zero...is that a strong enough statement?! Don't buy!"
2,Cheap,"This worked okay for about a year, but now it's stopped registering rainfall. I think the plastic arm inside has gotten gummed up."
1,This product needs work,"Twice I have had to remove the batteries from BOTH units just to reset the remote to zero. Resetting the remote to zero should be the simple task of pressing the reset button on the remote. I previously admired the name ""La Crosse"". Right now I question their design, engineering and manufacturing of this product.TBJ"
1,don't get it,"I have had this rain gauge about a year and it is more trouble than it's worth. The company tells me it's the batteries, they were't ""fresh"" enough. Well, I have changed the batteries and still only works for a day or so. When I contacted the company I was told that if it still didn't work I could send it back and they would test it. Just a word of caution....don't buy it!!!"
1,Buy something better! Useless !,"I could not get it to work after three weeks. I am use to complicated, reliable, scientific instruments( I am an Analytical Chemist) and this item is not one of them! I contacted the company and their replies were canned and useless. Even at its best, you have to take the batteries out of each piece to reset it. What is wrong with a simple shunt button? My advice is to try something else. I may use it for target practice. BGR , Central NJ"
2,Frustrating,"Original didn't work from last December. Replacement came, followed directions, had to call for assistance, finally got it working. Worked fine all year until now. Display dimmed out so I replaced batteries in collector and receiver. Followed specific instructions for setting up again, but just getting dashes on display instead of zeros. Given up on La Crosse ""Technology."""
1,PLEASE do not waste your money to this!,"I purchased this rain gauge on Christmas Day for myself and my brother and it worked for approximately 30 days.First off, the outside component is flimsy - the battery cover broke when I inserted the batteries and I had to use tape to secure them, which allowed moisture into the battery compartment. The plastic holes broke when I anchored it on my fence, and even though the bucket and receiver were well within 30-feet of each other, they would not communicate so I had to go through the process of moving and securing again.Each time you want to zero out the meter you have to remove the batteries and then reestablish the connection, which is a pain. The second time I zeroed out the unit all I got were dashes on the display screen.I will stick with my reliable tube rain gauge from now on and do without the cheap toy."
1,Disappointment,Simply doesn't work. Batteries are OK and have changed the line of sight but there is no recording of rainfall. A big disappointment.
1,Don't waste your batteries,"I bought the rain gauage and had problems with trying to have the receiver zero out when inserting the batteries. After 2 days of trying to get it to zero out, I returned it and bought another one. It took several more tries to get it to work and finaly successed. I had to remove a battery and inserted 2 new batteries and guess what, Again it would not zero out. I am not new to electronics and have had several rain gauges over the years, but this is a worthless product!!!!!!!"
1,La Crosse Wireless Rain Center,Not what I expected. A lot of plastic and a mechanical arm. I have no confidence in the product.
3,Cook's weakest,"I am a big Cook fan from way back. I picked this up as I do all his books. It is a reprint of a story from the early 90s.Frankly, it is not worthy of his skill. He was writing far better than this in his earliest work. It has the superficial feel of fan fiction. The characters are extremely flat with few exceptions. It would not shock me to learn that it was an unedited draft.Other reviewers have rightly noted the abrupt ending. The tale must have been far longer in Cook's conception.Finally, I have to admit that the title makes no sense to me; I have no idea what it refers to or derives from."
2,Skip This One,"There are few books in English on one of the most important, complex, and fascinating episodes in European history since the Renaissance. Most on Amazon's list are special order or out of print. Unfortunately, Parker and his writers produced a dry, dull, tedious tome that will bore even serious 30YW enthusiasts. Novices should special-order Wedgwood instead; enthusiasts will want to read S.R. Gardiner."
1,Stultifyingly Dull,"The Thirty Years War is an area of study I really want to know more about. It is complex, and the political interactions of most of the nations of Europe make it a huge task to explain.This book lacks. I'm sure the facts are complete and accurate, but the writing is as dry as week old toast. None of the personae came alive, and none of the facts were made memorable. I would recommend it as a reference, perhaps, but not as an interesting read on the subject. It sits on my shelf while I seek better written works to capture my interest."
5,Very useful,"Recommended by my teacher, I bought this to get ready for a career in epidemiology. Since then, it's never failed me."
4,Good reference handbook,I needed a good reference handbook to have for infectious diseases and this book was the perfect one. I am not sure how different the latest version is though.
3,Evil but entertaining,"The book's philosophy is reprehensible. It is all about destroying society, with no plans regarding how a bunch of malicious loafers will create a better society after the current one is demolished. Having said that, a lot of the book is pretty entertaining. Hoffman tells of lots of ways to get things for free, and it is amazing to see the lengths he goes to to avoid work. I read the book in high school, and it is fun reading it again now. I just don't think I would recommend it to the unstable."
4,Found this as a PDF online,"Steal This Book! by Abbie Hoffman is a good study of the spirit of the Yippie movement. The freeloading methods are quite creative, though some are now outdated with the development of technology. The Yippies were against the capitalist system and created communes, but they also did not want to work if they could avoid it; there was a lack of self-sufficiency. If the capitalist system was going to be around, they had no problems mooching off it.And this was probably why the whole Hippie movement failed.[...], [...]"
2,Stole it in 1977 from Books Inc.,It wasn't worth it. Even a no cost. Most of his scams were already known. Hobo's had told me about most of them when I was a kid in the 50's.
2,steal this (out-dated useless) book,this book may actually have been remotely usefull sometime around the time of its publication but as for the nineties it offers nothing more than a laugh at times. hoffman was not by any means a revolutionary. he was more like a loud mouthed drug user. if you would like an actual survival manual go down to your local army-navy store and give them the 2.50 or whatever for the army's survival guide.
3,"I wouldn't pay for it, that's for sure","I think this book is really neat to look at...once. Let's face it: Either you are currently a dedicated anarchist/freak/head/whatever, and you are already committed to the cause, or you are normal person, and one book isn't going to put you on a crusade agains The Man. Most of the information in this book is outdated, so it isn't valuable except as a historical reference. And if you really need to know how to make bombs, should you be suckling at the teat of a giant corporation like Amazon, and using a credit card that the government will use to track your purchases so as to put you on a watch list? Steal this book, borrow this book, take this book out from a library, but do something more productive with your hard-earned cash...like finance the Revolution (donations are being accepted)."
5,Hippie Bible,"If you ever wanted to know what people mean when they say ""back in the Day"" then this is a must read. Then you need to read Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Slaughterhouse Five, The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test, Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and then you will have a pretty good idea of what ""back in the Day"" means. Man, like this book is groovy. Peace."
3,Not a first book to read,"I was introduced to this book in 1972 at twelve years old. obviously it was not ment for children. I thought it was ""cool"" to steal and o.k. to be a free loader.I became a good undercover criminal for many years of my life. This is one of the books that should have been burned for the good of our nation. If you find this book still amusing, check yourself.God Bless"
5,If only Abbie Hoffman were alive AND well...,"Originally I stole the book. Unfortunately, someone stole it from me. Despite the fact that I have always been just a little left of center, I always held the book in high regard. Today, I think it makes recalling those days a treasure. I will display it in my office...just to make them wonder where I'm coming from!"
2,Only good for historical perspective today,"As a professed liberal-radical, I was long excited to read Hoffman's seminal organizing text. I heard so much about this infamous title, but never could apparently find a copy of the book itself. When I finally did get a copy, I was disappointed how short-sighted Hoffman's goals were.Even in the 1960's, the tactics in this book would not help the intended audience. The frequent advocacy of violence as a tool to make change appears to be more in line with the far right.There are some useful critiques of power relationships here, but the book suffers from very outdated information. What was cutting edge for activists in my parent's generation now seems like it should be a historical footnote in a Smithsonian exhibit on political protest in the 1960's.Individuals who are looking for an in-depth portrait of Hoffman should consider renting/purchasing 'Steal This Movie'."
4,One of a kind !!,"I turn 40 in 4 days. This book really brings me back to High School. It helped define an era, for better or worse?! I lost my copy of Steal This book back in the 70's and can't believe it's still available. Thanks Amazon !! AAhhh, the good old days."
4,Warning -- This book may get you arrested...,"...but don't let that minor detail keep you from steal-- er, I mean buying this book. Hoffman is a rebel with the cause of bringing down the establishment that he feels is corrupted, evil and oppressive. Most of the phone numbers and addresses in this book are severely out of date, but there is loads of still useful information in ""Steal This Book"". Harmless methods of obtaining free food, furniture, and clothing are described, as well as some innovative shoplifting techniques are described within. Hoffman even touches briefly on guerilla warfare and bomb-making, etc... Abbie was about freedom, and this book contains some very intriguing methods of exercising your freedom as an Amerikan citizen, whether the pigs like it or not."
5,Down with the establishment!,"This book reminded me of what is missing from radicalism today, fearlessness. Not only is this a humourous, witty book outlining tips for survival, but it now serves as a social commentary on the hippie movement. Like Robin Hood, Hoffman says ,steal from the capitalists, give to the poor. Today this book inspires me the way it did to other optimistic lefties years ago."
4,Keeping it simple,"I have spent hours pouring over business texts as part of my studies and it is only recently that it occured to me that a pre-condition for business writing is verbosity. Where one word will do it seems that the norm is to write 10! I wouldn't mind if they were wise, witty or otherwise held my interest but for the most part seem to fit the catageory of ""padding"".Value Drivers suited me very well because it seeme to highlight the pertinent issues quickly and accurately without going into unnecessary detail. The models introduced have been relevant to a number of the modules on my course including marketing and finance as well as strategy. Since I am interested in marketing then the case study examples given have also been relevant.In a nutshell a fine example of brevity, clarity and precision. One small niggle. More illustrations, please. Pictures paint etc. My course load would reduce if more books were written in this way!"
5,A great way to get up to speed,"This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to get started in thinking about modern managment concepts and hasn't got time to plough through a library of management periodicals.Scott takes a variety of modern business, strategy, and marketing concepts and boils them down. However the book is very readable, and thoughtfully illustrated to guide you through the sequence. This is not a book for academics, who may get frustrated by its down to earth practicality.It is a book for working managers and we intend to make it a standard text in our management development program."
3,Big Eyes Compact,"This mirror is great as far as not distorting yourimage when using the magnification side. However,when I received the product it was broken, not packedvery well, it was mailed in an envelope that looked as if it was crushed or stepped on...However, I would purchase it again.."
1,"Bulky, ugly, mediocre performance","The TV tuner included in this LCD monitor is more of a marketing gimmick than something useful. First of all, the monitor is not good as an everyday display workhorse. Text tends to be fuzzy and colors are washed out. Viewing angle is also limited, poorer than monitors from even ""no-name"" companies like Sceptre and AG Neovo. Second, the monitor is bulky and ugly. Third, overall build quality feels flimsy."
3,its ok,"The prossess was very good as usual, but the product was slightly flawed. It has a big black blotch in the middle of the screen. We didn't want to go through the hassel of sending it back, could have been better for a refurbished tv."
1,Not even the first chapter!,"Apologies to the author, but this was a pretty poor effort. It seemed pretty much a stereotypical ""Native American man meets white woman and they create their own special bond."" kind of story. She's brave, headstrong and impetuous, and for some far fetched reason she's out in the middle of the prairie, with a bunch of soldiers. He and his tribe want to stop the white man from encroaching upon their sacred hunting grounds. He's been taught English by two different people and while the words,""lips the color of the setting sun"" appear to be in his vocabulary, he hasn't learned the word ""I"". Really? Someone's been watching too many 1950's cowboys and Indians movies. I couldn't even make it past the first chapter, freebie or not."
1,History Book or Romance?,Janelle Taylor has been one of my favorites since I started reading romance novels 20 years ago. I have always enjoyed her books but this one was a bore. I felt like I was getting a history lesson in American Indians instead of reading a romantic tale. So disappointing!
2,Lakota Flower,"Just finished the Lakota Series. I felt Lakota Flower left many questions unanswered i.e., did Wind Dancer ever become chief, did the tribe survive the indian wars, did David reach Texas and prosper, did Nehemana every marry and if so was it to Red Wolf... After finishing the last paragraph just wanted to say AND??? Wish their had been one more book to wrap everything up."
3,Love & Native American History,"I read this book because I got it free for my Kindle. I'm not a romance novel reader, but I enjoyed this book. If you're looking for hot, steamy sex, this isn't what this book is all about. The story itself is a foregone conclusion right from the start, but I could tell that the real tale was the history of the Lakota Indians during this period of time.At times, this story read more like a history book and it was obvious Ms. Taylor was desperate to get in all the facts, much of which was unnecessary. Living in the northwest myself and knowing a little about the Native American culture, I feel the author was careful to depict life very close to how it really was during this time period.I haven't got a burning desire to read more from this author, but I enjoyed this story."
5,Great condition,"I returned this book because the class I ordered didn't meet, but I was impressed with the quality. I will use this seller again."
2,just doesn't work,Nice leather and it looks good but the hole for the ipod dial is off center so it makes this pretty much unusable (and stupid looking). The plastic cover I tried to clean with wipes but it still looks dirty. I also picked this up because it said it could stand-up but it doesn't really work well - very unstable. I am sending it back for a refund.
2,arrived warm,this is an item that should have arrived in a chilled condition. There was inadequate chilling material in the styrofoam box and the sauces were warm. It is not known whether the items were safe to consume.
1,Makes steak taste like vinegar.,"First of all, Peter Luger's Steakhouse is highly over-rated. The steak is overdone and tastes too fatty, sweet and vinegary. In fact, at the restaurant, they actually tip the plate up and take a big spoonful of the fat that has drained to the bottom, and poor it like sauce over your steak serving. Crazy, in my opinion. Anyway, this retail version of the sauce is just as bad: tons of sugar and mostly vinegar. Marinate your steak in this and all you'll taste is the vinegar. This sauce will ruin a good cut of meat. From good to best, buy shell (aka strip), sirloin, top sirloin, porterhouse, tenderloin (aka filet mignon) and use a non-vinegar-based marinade, like wine and herbs."
3,Seems to be coming up,"It's been about 5 weeks since we installed this tape on the steps from our garage to our mudroom in the house. The steps are interior, but are subject to a lot of severe cold and rough handling from car to house. The tape looks good, and it applied easily. However, in some places it looks like the tape might be lifting up. We're not sure if this is because of the extreme temperatures, if the adhesive isn't working, or if the tape needs a 100% smooth surface (we applied directly to a textured concrete). We're happy with it in general, but we do expect to reapply in the spring."
3,Lasts about a year; isn't transparent,"The tape works, but gets brittle and falls apart after about a year when used outside.Also, it's not transparent -- it's white."
2,I'm still looking,Installed in a textured fiberglass shower. a quarter of it came off on the first use. Looked great but didn't last. I'm still looking for something that works.
2,"Practically has same info and pics contained in author's ""Mitsubishi Lancer Evo: The Road Car & WRC Story""","If you have, or have read, Brian Long'sMitsubishi Lancer Evo: The Road Car & WRC Storythen don't buy this book as this book is like a condensed version. The ""Mitsubishi Lancer Evo: The Road Car & WRC Story"" is, in my opinion, more comprehensive, if you want a more detailed history of the Lancer Evo. I might even venture to say that the content of ""Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution"" is part of ""the Road Car & WRC Story."""
3,Dupré - Not a great start to a fantastic series,"The first disc in the series was recorded on the Casavant organ (4 manuals and pedal) in the Cathedral of SS. Peter and Paul, Providence, USA. The organ's wooden flutes are very impressive and mellow and add to the overall feel of the repertoire very well. Because of the chosen repertoire, there wasn't any opportunity for the organist to demonstrate the reeds available, so no valid comment can be passed on them. Much of the music is played on soft flutes, and is wonderfully relaxing as background music, but I wouldn't want to listen to the whole disc in one go.All things aside, this is a reasonable recording at a reasonable price. Had it cost any more than it did, I don't think I would have bought it. James Biery's playing is very true to the scores, but maybe a few more changes in registration wouldn't have gone astray."
5,"Excellent Risotto Rice, the one I typically use in my home","A passionate home cook that has been honing her cooking skills for the last 25 years, concentrating on Italian for the last 10 years, writes this review. My favorite cookbooks are ""The Professional Chef"" by the Culinary Institute and ""Culinary Artistry"". I initially purchased the Carnaroli Rice on a whim because it wasn't the typical Arborio that I normally use. Now I buy it because I like it more than Arborio.Pros:1. Excellent for Risotto2. Texturally a little harder than Arborio3. Seems to be more starchy than Arborio4. Makes a lovely Risotto cake or Arancini di RisoCons:1. Difficult to locateIf you only make your risotto with Arborio rice I highly recommend that you give this rice a try. I find that I select the Carnaroli first for risotto since it seems to be easier to obtain an al dente texture than with the Arborio. If you haven't tried this rice it is certainly worth checking out."
2,Big Disappointment,I was very disappointed by this rice. I paid a lot of money per pound and it tasted like any regular parboiled rice. Also the rice was from Argentina and not Italy. It tastes nothing like the creamy rissotto rice from Italy. I do not recommend this rice to anybody.
1,"Striking how many of these ""revelations""","bore such resemblance to each other. It made me think of the form letters I used to do as a secretary. I can just see Joe Smith taking a ""master"" and adjusting the wording to bring about whatever righteous directive was needed in order to feed the insatiable demands of his ego, greedy ambition and lust."
1,Good for people trying to understand Mormonism,"This book is good only for people tyring to understand Mormon theology, yet it is scary at the same time while reading it to know that people actually believe that what is in it was actually inspired by God. It is blatenly contradictory to the teachings in the Bible. It is interesting to note that the revelations received from God decrease majorly after Jeseph Smith is killed. To those offended, my apologies, but blind exceptence is no excuse for believing something."
1,This DVD doesn't work!,"At roughly the 6:30 mark, the DVD fades to black in the middle of a segment and never comes back on. I returned the first one purchased, and the second one did the same thing. In looking at the other reviews, I'm not the only person to experience this. Customer service was wonderful in terms of the return; however, I strongly suspect this batch of DVD's is flawed. I purchased this for classroom use and think it would have been an excellent teaching tool had it worked."
1,Waste of money,Amazon was very good to refund our money. I had expected a Christmas musical type show. This was just an old tv show; and it was unpleasant quality and far too dated.
2,Doris Day: Christmas Memories,Quality was not good. Enjoyed seeing her again but seemed choppy and not edited well. Played on large screen might have affected the quality.
3,Fun DVD.,"I hadn't realised Doris Day had a television Series. I was expecting to see a couple variety show type shows, but, it was fun to watch none the less. Great deal for a fun product!"
5,A classic!,"If you love the classic shows like Doris Day, Mary Tyler Moore, etc, you will really love this DVD. I had forgotten how good the Doris Day show was. It was a great surprise for the season."
2,Episodes from Doris Day TV series,I love Doris Day but I have to admit that both of these were hard to sit thru. Thank goodness for the fast forward button.
3,Series Xmas shows not Xmas Specials,"I purchased this for my Mom. She and I are both big Doris Day fans. I thought from the description that these were Doris Day Christmas specials like the variety shows that the big stars used to have at Christmas.This is three Christmas shows from the Doris Day series. One of them is pretty good. Another one is just cheesy. I don't remember if we watched the third one or not.Next time, I will stick to buying Doris Day movies. I have never gone wrong with those."
3,Reed redemption,"Gracious, well preserved old time offering with all the structural predictability that comes intact can be a limp, if technically fluid outing, but when focused in sweet saxophone soloing, shakes the dust off."
2,A so so timing light,"This timing light works for the most part. The cords are too short and the sensor for the plug wire does not pick up each ignition pulse, so you end up with intermittant pulses to check your timing. A bit dissapointing for the price, but it will do for now. Can't reccomend it unless your on a budget and cannot afford a better light."
2,Rather disappointing.,"The words were certainly weird enough, (except for ""scofflaw"", which I'd thought was a pretty standard and normal one) and I suppose ""wonderfulness"" is in the eye of the beholder; I just didn't find this book to be as interesting as I'd expected it to be; perhaps I'm not quite the logophile that I'd always thought of myself as. The concept seems interesting to me, but the execution was just a bit too bland for my taste."
5,Fun,I leave this one in the Bath room people get a kick out of the diffrant words.Very interesting.(ammusing)
2,Not the Bunnykins that I remember,I returned this item as it was not the Bunnykins Children's set that I expected. This set is no longer manufactured in England it now comes from Taiwan. The quality and the coloring is not the same. I am very disappointed that this set is no longer made in England. I will not purchase another one. I am willing to pay more for English goods. I am tired of cheap goods.
3,made in Indonesia,"I was disappointed to find Royal Doulton Bunnykins was made in Indonesia not in England asI always knew it to be. As far as the item itself the pattern was very nice... If didnt need itright away for a gift, would have returned because of being made in Indonesia... Should put thatin details for future buyers"
2,Too noisy to use,"It is a linear actuator, and provides plenty of force at a very low price. Unfortunately for may application, it had some issues which made it unusable:1 Incredibely noisy and the noise has an extremely poor quality, like a cheap electric drill.2 Does not include a pot for positional feedback.3 Has a lot of hysteresis which means you cannot get precise, low speed movement and require a high threshold current to get the actuation started.In general, I just need a higher quality actuator and shouldn't have bought this one. Looking back, what did I expect for $120. Take this into consideration before buying."
5,A Stunning Symphony of Voices,"I purchased this CD because I was exploring the vocal music of this era and the reviews seemed to endorse it. I was not disappointed. These are absolutely gorgeous works, almost magical in their effect on the listener. Some of the most beautiful Renaissance-era music I've ever heard. Higly recommended"
2,Thin for high price,"As others have said, it's too thin for the price. It's thinner (less warm) than your average sweatshirt. The breeze goes through it like a breeze. For 55 degrees and over only, with no wind. Spring and early fall only. It is stylish and the fit is good. Too bad Columbia cheeped-out on the thickness."
1,Mojo No Go,"I have a Windows XP PC and couldn't get this game to run. There seems to be a problem with QuickTime--Bad Mojo objected to my newer version on install and wanted to replace it with its older version. I really wanted to run the game, so I replaced Quicktime, but the game still crashed at a necessary cut scene. After reading some forums, I decided I'd have to uninstall QT in ""safe"" mode to fully clear it from my system, then let Bad Mojo install its version. After that, it crashed on startup. Tried compatibility modes, then tried reinstalling the latest QT, with no improvement. And note that there is now NO customer support for this game if you run into problems like I did. I mean...it's only a few bucks, but now I have this tempting yet totally unplayable game, plus I spent two evenings trying to get it to run. Very sad."
1,Ew.,"I apparently should have paid more attention to the synopsis when I bought it, but I was not prepared to have my character crawl over extremely realistic bloodied rat carcasses to play this game. I lasted about five minutes before becoming so disgusted I had to quit. I assume teenage boys LOVE this - I did not."
3,Mixed feelings,"I'm not sure how I feel about this book. I wanted to love it because I liked the first 2 in the series. But for some reason, I felt something was missing in this one. I suppose the heroine, Adele, never really appealed to me.I generally liked Damien--her certainly had no intentions of betraying his cousin Harold--although his wordiness at the end seemed almost out of character.It's not a bad story at all, but for me something I cannot put my finger on seemed to be missing. Because I'm so wishy-washy on it, I'm giving this one 3 stars."
2,Ehhh,"I was actually bored by this book. It was too...contrived. Everything was too perfect and predictable, unlike the other two in the series. Something was definitely missing here. The story was just too bland."
1,Dry but Sore Feet,"I purchased Paw Tectors for our Australian Shepherds. The dogs are walked on country roads in Northern Wisconsin that are sanded and salted during the winter months. These booties did stay on the dogs' feet, but I stopped using them because they were too stiff and rubbed on their paws until they were bleeding."
4,Lounge music for the gallows,"When Alfred Hitchcock was at the peak of his popularity, thanks to his TV series, ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents,"" someone came up with the wonderful idea of Hitch narrating an easy-listening album filled with black humor. Now DRG has reissued this grim but sly gem on CD for the first time. Hitch provides his usual droll commentary while his musical director, Hollywood veteran Jeff Alexander, conducts creepy arrangements of old standards like ""After You've Gone"" to underline the album's homicidal tendencies. It's great fun if that sort of humor appeals to you. That album has been paired with the soundtrack to the British film ""Circus of Horrors,"" which is less interesting but may appeal to film-score buffs. But Hitchcock fans are urged to pick this one up."
2,Hitchcock music,"I was not impressed with this CD. The preview provided did not really give an accurate view of this product. The music overall, is average, and Hitchcock speaks over a lot of it... Not at all what I expected or needed for background music/sounds for a play... Disappointed, and never used any of it..."
5,Very helpful!,"We rescued our beagle from a shelter, and prior to that, knew the basics of the breed. This book has been very helpful in giving us the details that are particular to beagles. It's very well-written, and easy to read. I especially like the authors use of ""sidebars"" to give the reader interesting and useful tidbits. This is a great book for beginning beagle owners!"
5,One special album.,"""Labour Of Lust"" #31 (1979).Nick Lowe's 2nd solo album ""Labour Of Lust"", was a fun little album in 1979. Played a lot during my freshman year in college. With Dave Edmunds, Billy Bremner and Terry Williams helping Nock on this disc, (they would form Rockpile and release ""Seconds Of Pleasure"" in 1980). Here you get the charming ""Cruel To Be Kind"" #12 hot 100, still enjoy this song 32 years on. The wonderful ""Cracking Up"", the out of it ""Big Kick, Plain Scrap"", the 60's pop of ""American Squirm"", Mickey Jupp's ""Switchboard Susan"", ""She's the greatest little operator"". The tough ""Born Fighter"", the 50's type ballad ""You Make Me"", the bouncy guitar of ""Skin Deep"", the country fill of ""Endless Grey Ribbon"", the rockabilly of ""Without Love"", the power pop of ""Dose Of You"" and ""Love So Fine"", band having a good time. An album that is special. Nick is still going great guns today."
5,CD - Labour of Lust,Thank you so much for such a pleasant transaction. It was a birthday gift and my friend was very surprised and has told me many times how much he enjoys listening to this CD.
4,just lkke yhe books!,My daughter was thrilled! She's an avid bsc reader and wanted the movie. Great price and great product! Happy buyer here :)
1,damaged,"My package arrived in a timely manner, but the product seemed like it was dropped or smacked against something. The cover/case has an indentation on the front I'm disappointed with the damage that was done to the merchandise."
4,wonderful,i thought that this movie wasn't as good as the baby-sitters t.v series. But it was still good in some ways. I encourage you to see the baby-sitters club t.v series. But the movie was still okay!
3,It was okay.,"The movie was decent, but the real reason I watched it in the first place is because Austin O'Brien is in it. He is very sexy. I wouldn't really recommend the movie, though. The story is kind of boring. It's a very typical plot."
5,greatest book of all time.,Jessi and the dance school phantom is one of the best books i ever read in my life. END
3,what's up with the casting??,"Being a BSC fan, I saw this movie right when it came out, and I also have a copy of it at home. It's a great film with a good storyline, but I can't help wondering what was wrong with the casting. Let's start with the leader Kristy Thomas. There's nothing wrong with Schuyler Fisk's acting, but she simply couldn't carry out the bossy, assertive, character that Kristy had. In this movie she's whiny, wimpy and totally takes a back seat--all the qualities that the character certainly should not have had. The other six girls were decent, but if you want to see these books come to life, stick with the videos that came out in the early 90's. Those girls knew how to carry out these roles--the movie is weakened by the poor acting and the changed personalities of the leading girls. It is a sweet story and has a fine message--very much in the Baby Sitters Club tradition--but the video series is 100 times better. BSC fans might be disappointed with this movie."
3,Fun for Fans of the Book Series,"Harmless fun for fans of the book series (others probably couldn't care less about this movie). The Baby-Sitters club decides to run a summer camp, but things go astray when Kristy's (Fisk) long absentee father returns. Since he promises her not to tell anyone he's back, she does a lot of sneaking around. Only Mary Anne (Cook) knows the truth and she's not telling. This causes trouble for the club."
4,Nostalgia,"Okay, I'm a teenager, and I haven't seen this movie in awhile. But in 1995, when I loved BSC, this was my /favorite/ movie. Remembering back, this movie was like a cooler version of the original TV series, and I was just at the age that the guys in the movie were looking mighty good. I remember loving the music and casting too; although I must agree with another reviewer that the girl who played Kristy was not quite as I imagined. TAll the babysitters seemed a little more realistic than in the books, and I liked that. It's a great movie for growing girl, and it leaves you happy all over in the end. I still have the book based on the movie, and maybe I'll reread it later this week... :)"
5,i really like the babysitters club vidio <I> am there # 1 f,"dear the babysitters club and ann .m. martin i really love your books!!!sincerly, christine franco"
5,Nice accompaniment by Claudette Cricket and birds,"Not a typical New Age album. I like the ""woods"" theme that runs throughout all of the tracks. There is also a nice fusion with classical music themes and generous use of more ""standard"" instruments like violins, oboes and flutes and less emphasis on such typical New Age mainstays like drum machines and things with names like ""Moog."" Even where there is synthesizers, etc. it tends to be sound very natural and playful (not overdone and depressing a la Tangerine Dream). Besides, I can't help but like the fact that the liner notes contain an acknowledgement to a cricket (named Claudette) who sat in on a session and who displayed ""impeccable rhythm and incredible control of dynamics."" Unfortunately, the cricket is no longer with the band - which may be why this is the only ""Fresh Aire"" CD I have."
3,Their Weakest Album...Not Bad At All,"The reason why I gave this album three stars is quite simple. While there are some huge hits on this album such as ""Toccatta"" (one of their all time best) and ""Mere Image"", there are some really disappointing tracks as well. When they hit big, THEY HIT BIG. When they miss, THEY MISS BIG (Fresh Aire IV is similar to Fresh Aire III in this respect). ""Small Wooden Bach'ses"" (an ode to the great composer himself) is one of the most pleasant pieces on the album. Unfortunately, pieces like ""The Cricket"" and ""Morning"" can be downright annoying. With all due respect to Chip Davis (I'm a huge fan), ""Morning"" is something I would expect to hear in an elevator. I suppose this would be the New Age version of a concept album (""The Woods are Alive!""). Not a bad idea. Overall, not a bad album. I'd give it 3 and 1/2 stars if I could."
4,Through the woods we go...,"If the Fresh Aire series maintained its creative leaps on pace with I, II, and III for the whole series, Mannheim Steamroller would probably be remembered as one of the greatest bands of the 80's. Fresh Aire III is a terrific improvement on FAII's timeless formula, and does an even better job incorporating synthesizers with classic instruments than its predecessor. This album has some of my most favorite songs on it: Amber, Mere Image, Sky, and Midnight are all beautiful songs whose arrangements are surprising.Unfortunately, The Cricket should've been rethought; it sounds out of place on the record. And again, the album is WAY too short. Still, this is one of their best releases, and I recommend it for even the most casual fan."
1,A Match Made in Scandal,"I'm in the minority here, in that I thought this book was boring and the characters uninspiring. This is supposed to be an historical romance, but without the picture on the cover, one could easily think the action takes place in the 20th or 21st century. The story is about Rachel, an accomplished engineer and part owner of a corporation, who is desperately trying to get recognition for her abilities, as well as hold her division together. The head of the corporation is a childhood friend who was previously married to her best friend. There is some chemistry between the two of them, although it isn't really clear why they haven't gotten together before. Most of the action deals with corporate matters instead of the romance, so I couldn't really get into it. It is nothing like my favorite authors, Celeste Bradley, Jo Beverley, or those of that genre. If you like passionate romance, this isn't the one for you."
5,Chuck Slate,The author of this book is acutally my grandfather. He's an increadible writer and inspires me. I'm going to attempt to write a book as well. He is an awsome person and has very intelligent veiws.
3,In the Beggining,"One of the first tools I obtained when I renewed my business as a personal trainer was one of these BF testers. Its light weight, portable and gives you a good base line. Gives you great options and i loved the myotape that came with it.. I've since moved on to the Tanita BF-350 as I've improved my services."
3,Nice hat.. May run a little big.,Very nice hat. I usually wear a 7 1/8 size fitted hat which is what the medium size is supposed to be. This hat seems a little bigger than any 7 1/8 hat i have owned in the past. Its just a little to big all around so i'll just try to shrink it a little i guess.
5,Repeat customer,"I tend to wear out hats often and this is the 3rd version of this hat I have bought because I love it so much, but I get sick of wearing a sun-bleached/shrunken hat so I buy a new one once in a while. Thanks again!"
4,Worked great except dim display,"maybe just a fluke, but mine had very dim display, had to view from very limited angle with no glare."
4,Great labeler- screen can be a bit difficult to see,"I would have given this labeler a 5, but the screen can be a bit difficult to see. Love the capability and ease of use though. When I first put batteries into it, I thought it was broken because I couldn't get the screen to react. However, it turned out that you have to have the screen at a certain angle to see it. That's my only complaint. The labeler has great flexibility and is a great value."
3,Does Not Come With Label Paper Cartridge,Does not come with label paper cartridge. Bought this for my wife for Xmas. Bummed out because I can't try it and it looks cool otherwise.
1,Made to sell label tape. GARBAGE - AVOID,"This thing blatantly forces you to waste tape. This isn't simply about an extensive margin, these boobs make you cut every label MANUALLY! An entire INCH of tape is wasted with every label. You simply have to cut it off. With every label, it has a 1 inch leader, marked with a colon so you know where to cut with SCISSORS!Brother label machines are normally great, but this thing has to be the most disappointing product I have ever seen from Brother. I hope somebody launches a class-action over this because they do not disclose that you will waste an inch of tape with EVERY PRINTING.I got this cheap from [...], so once the cartridge that came with it runs out I'll throw it in the toilet tank to help conserve water."
2,Are you kidding me?,Purchased this for the office crew and cannot believe that any company sells a product like this without the ac power supply. Are you kidding me? Is Brother so desperate for additional revenue streams that they don't bump the price $5 and include the adapter? I am sending them the 9 receipts for batteries that I have had to constantly replace in this unit and demanding a refund for those additional expenses.FAIL! Shame on you Brother! What a pathetic way to supply your customers with what they need!
2,"Wasteful, requires manual cutting","Unlike other Brother models I've used, this one insists on wasting a full inch of leader on every label (and the same on a trailer, unless you override that). Even if you adjust the trailer length, it still puts the wasted leader on the front, then adds dots to tell you where to MANUALLY cut off the excess. NOT an acceptable solution.What's worse, there's no way to know this before you start to use it - even the instructions don't directly state it, but only talk around the subject, so you waste a lot of labels trying to adjust the leader before figuring it out."
2,Waste of money,"What an incredible waste of money. As others say, the tape wastage is huge. Also, no adapter and to top it off I can't see the typing on the stupid screen. I have to get real close and in just the right light or I can't tell how it's set or what it's going to print. Back it goes!"
1,No AC adaptor included? FAIL.,"I'm not even going to bother talking about the features on this thing. The fact that Brother has the nerve to sell a unit without including the proprietary AC adaptor is bad enough in itself to warrant 1 star. Buyer beware: you buy this, you'll spend on batteries what you saved on the label maker."
5,Great garden labeler,I purchased this for outdoor use. The labels have withstood intense sun and rain. It's simple to use and has come in handy for all kinds of things. I'm quite satisfied with the quality.
3,Adam Bede,I was urged by Amazon to write a review on this product before I listened to it. My review has to be neutral.
5,"Well, I am a detective.","I first saw this movie in the mid '70's and I just howled at it. Being familiar with ""The Maltese Falcon"" makes it even funnier. In fact for maximum impact,I recommend watching TMF first and then ""The Black Bird"". The writers skewered every scene in the original. ""What good is torture without the threat of death behind it?.... It's fun!"" This film also includes one of my favorite character actors, Lionel Stander, who does a great job as the tough guy. Add former Playmate Connie Kreske, three big Hawaiians and priceless dialogue and sight gags and you got 5 stars. I thought the ending was in perfect keeping with Sam Jr's luck. All together a classic movie that slipped through the cracks. Anxiously awaiting the DVD."
3,Funny spoof of a classic film noir,"Not many film buffs are aware of this quite obscure little movie, I guess. Which is a pity, as it actually is quite funny and decently made parody of the so much better known classic, The Maltese Falcon. Available only on video, I think it really should be distributed in DVD format for a wider audience. It deserves more recognition, as much more inferior parodies are being churned out from movie companies every year. There are several funny scenes in the movie, and the dialogue is often hilarious. To like and appreciate this film, I'd presuppose three things: 1) that you know the original ""Maltese Falcon"" 2) that you find MAD magazine movie parodies funny 3) that you dislike the all-too-raunchy and too fastpaced American movie ""comedies"", calculated to appeal to infantile and brainless modern teenage moviegoers."
3,Not Quite Up To Expectations,"In THE BLACK BIRD the son of Sam Spade inherits the old family detective business in a seedy neighborhood in San Francisco. After Caspar Gutman's body is found near the detective's office, a renewed search for the elusive Maltese Falcon is begun in earnest. Junior also inherits his father's secretary, Effie Perine. Wilmer Cook gets involved with the new search along with some other eccentric characters.The movie was produced by George Segal who doubled in the role of Sam Spade, Jr. The supporting cast included Stephane Audran, Lionel Stander, Lee Patrick, Elisha Cook, Jr., Signe Hasso and John Abbott."
2,Very poor latch,"I build small keepsake boxes. These hinges are unsuitable for anything but appearance of a latch. They are very thin material and bend easily. The latch is stiff and the catch has very little detent so the latch sometimes catches and most times doesn't. The escutcheon pins that came with the catch are very thin and won't drive without bending unless the wood is very soft, like pine. I ended up discarding the pins and using #2 round head slot screws. They don't look as nice as pins but I was able to secure the latch to the box. I have 3 sets of these catchs left but think they are headed for the waste bin. There is little point to installing a non funcitoning cheap catch on a $40 box. My customers won't like it. I guess I'll keep looking for a decent small box catch. :("
3,Not up to prequel...,"Of course the story is amazing and thrilling for Americans to re-live. Unfortunately the cinematography is not anywhere near the quality offered in Winds of War. Many episodes are almost too dark to see, and there are troubling flashes of light in several scenes. After the joy of watching Winds of War in its totality, four times over the past five years, we found this product a technical disappointment."
3,"Grand scope, history-based drama ... but not exceptional quality","It's grand in scope and reasonably entertaining. However, this production crams so much history and drama into one mini-series, that they have over simplified the facts and the historical figures. Many of the characters are one-dimensional caricatures, especially the Germans. For example, the actor portraying Hitler is continuously over-acting and is not believable. The writing/acting/directing of this mini-series is not of excellent quality. Band Of Brothers, Roots, or Shaka Zulu are all far superior TV mini-series."
4,Nice over all portrait of WWII,"I like it becouse it streatch over the whole WWII period, not meny series or movies have tried that. On the contrary to meny others I like the cast in this W&R better then the cast in Winds of War."
5,"excellent movies, 1/2 the price","historicaly accurate and very well done ,enjoyed them so very much. the type of series you can watch again and again. Thank you Amazon great prices and quick delivery!!"
4,Missing Episode Promo's for each chapter and coming attractions,"War and Remembrance: The Complete Epic Mini-SeriesI was very leary about replacing my two volume set with this **complete** collection, but I heard that the set contained all the AIRED Pre Episode spots and Coming Attractions and boy was I wrong. Unfortunately they will never be seen again. I taped the mini-series back in 1988 and have all the material, but it seems that without these spots there is something missing. In what I believe to be one of the greatest min-series ever produced it is a huge letdown that this material is not included"
3,War and Rememberance,"While the story is a great one, the first disc of the second part of the series was defective and had no sound -- a disappointment in trying to follow the movie."
3,War and Remembrence,Need to use more packing materials prior to shipping.DVD's and CD's need to be put in a box rather than a white envelopewith no packing materials. Damage during shipping happens when itemsare not packed properly.
4,Outstanding TV miniseries,"Very well done. True to the book. Gave me a good understanding of WWII. Visually outstanding. I was sad to see that they made so many changes to the cast, but the choices were good ones."
3,Good to watch once-great soap opera,"I'm glad I bought it, but I don't think I'd ever watch it again. Winds of War can be easy watched more than once.It's a well-done series, rather long, but the holocaust episodes take up a disproportionate amount of total time; otherwise, I would have rated it a 4-star movie if this were edited better. For people somewhat unaware of the holocaust, it may not be an issue.Lastly, Pug's wife, Rhoda, was also overdone. A person can't be as stupid as she was portrayed, so I found it hard to take her role as credible.I guess, in the final analysis, this was one hell of a soap opera production. Maybe 3-star is the proper rating?"
5,Well Worth It,"I bought the complete Epic Mini-Series of War and Remembrance for around $52.00 brand new from Amazon.com. Unlike the Winds of War, War and Remembrance is well worth the money and time to watch the series. A good history of WW II and the Holocaust."
5,Balance your strategy with a spice of wisdom,"43 yo (and getting better) beginer enterpreneur-I laughed at the comments made by a reviewer as he classified this book as bathroom reading, Ha! He is right on that, but that does not make the book any less effective than it is.This should not be your only book on enterpreneurship, yet this is a ideal book for being in there for the wisdom is given by those who have been there, and they tell it has it is.""Enterpreneurship is like parenting.if you wait until everything is right, you'll never get started"".This always hitted me where it hurts, the analogy is not totally accurate for sometimes (and just because nature cannot wait for the ""right"" time), parenting sometimes is bestowed on you, rather than a ""rational choise"".. but for enterpreneurship, the hardest part is beggining and the 2nd hardest, to see that ""The driving principle of business is CFN- Cash Flow Now!"""
3,Not what I was looking for...,"This is a good bathroom book... but I was looking for something else. This book is a collection of sayings that may be useful for someone looking for a quote for a speech... but is not something to sink your teeth into.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed some of the quotes, but I was looking for something more engaging."
5,inspiring,"inspiring book that illustrates the beauty within all, hope for an endangered species, connection between humans, animals, and our planet. Proceeds of the book benefit this innovation collaboration- I plan to purchase gift copies for birthdays, holidays.. really wonderful book for all ages."
2,Not so Much!,This book said it was used... Didn't know it had Library Stamps and Stickers all through out it! Used is one thing Worn out is another! I feel like I have a stolen library book!
3,It's Ok,"This is a simple collection of all the piano interludes throughout the first four albums of the Fresh Aire series. It's a great album. BUT I MUST SAY, you must be in the mood to listen to it. It is all slow, sad, and depressing music. If you are not a die hard fan, and already own the first four Fresh Aire albums, you could make this collection on your own."
3,BEANBAG LAP TRAY,"This is a good lap tray for writing notes on or putting drinks on or any other type of thing you might need a lap tray for. It's French motif is very pretty to look at so it needn't be put out of sight when guests come. The only thing I don't love about it is the bean bag bottom. I wished it had more traditional hard bottom or arms that fold out when needed as it sits a little lopsided when in use. Good price tho and for that price, a good quality. I agree with other reviewers tho, that the sticker they put on the face of the thing is most annoying to try to get off."
4,I liked this book,"Voice from the Ashes has interesting characters, a good plot line and a wonderful setting: the Mount St. Helens eruption!"
4,Beautiful,This is one of Beethoven's most beautiful works. I had heard portions of it on the radio;decided to get the whole thing and listen to it as a piece...instead of in pieces.
1,wasted 6 hours in frustration plus shipping costs,"Junk. After both my husband and I spent 3 hours each trying to get this thing to work, we are still only able to view 3 of the 97 photos from the CD this thing supposedly ""copied"" from the compact flash card. The rest of the photos files are unreadable. Big Disappointment."
3,"Looks good, sounds cheap","We had an old-timey doorbell that had the actual brass tubes that hung down and were struck when the doorbell rang. When it finally gave out, we searched quite a bit for an equivalent replacement, wanting to steer clear of all-electronic ones that just had a speaker instead of an actual bell. This was the closest thing we could find.I was hoping that because this door chime had actual mechanical strikers that it would give a similar rich sound to my old brass chimes. However, this doorbell sounds like the sort of bell you hear when you walk into a mall store, at the deli line when the next customer comes up, etc. Just a cheap sounding, generic ""donk-donk."" Maybe an electronic one wouldn't have been so bad afterall."
3,Form over function,"I liked the style of this unit so much I paid more than one should for a doorbell. It has a handsome wood cover that goes well with my decor but I aggree with another review, it sounds cheap. It is a lower pitched ding dong than my 30 year old one, and it sounds sad and short. My old one went dingggggg donggggggg, this one is barely a din-don. No resonance whatsoever. I saw this unit at Home Depot before they stopped carring it, and there was a button to hear the tone, however it was only an electronic recording, enhanced to add resonance i imagine. Oh, and I love the description ""Rubbed bronze tubes"", riiiiight. More like 100% plastic with some decorative film over them. I like the look, but for the money expect a lot better sound. Remorse. :("
3,Overpriced for what you receive,"I didn't want a plain doorbell to replace the old one in our house. I was willing to spend the extra money for a better look. In reality, the wood looks just as pictured, but the tubes on the sides are pretty lame. It's some sort of sticker-type application for the ""rubbed bronze tube"". High on a wall no one will notice, but I figured I should mention it as I'm sure some people will be really irritated by that."
2,Cherry Wired Door Chime,"I would not recommed this Door Chime. It looks great on the outside, but it sounds sick when it rings."
3,D E S P E R A T E H E A R T ! ! !,"Of all the tracks in the ""Hoopla"" CD one track stands out, ""Desperate Heart."" Mickey Thomas sang this tune as if his life depended on it. The phrasings are so darn wonderful. Especially the part where he sang, ""I can't let go til' my love is gone..."" with a catch in his throat strikes me and brings me to tears. All other tracks, well, I would rate them from terrible to great, but ""Desperate Heart"" is STUPENDOUS!"
4,We Built This City!,"This is not Starship's best album ever! I also would not call it the worst either. I will always love the song ""We Built This City!!"" Back in early 86 I was into ""Sara"" but that song lost its punch years ago. Check out ""Tomorrow Doesn't Matter Tonight"" for some lost 80s fun! Lets face it, Starship made a perfect album for 1985, just did not age well:("
3,bubble gum at its best,"The music's lousy, but in a good way. ""We Built this City"" is a classic (Give it an extra 1/2 star if you're actually in San Francisco when you are listening to it.), and ""Before I Go"" makes some attempt at being serious music. ""Sara"" is kind of pretty."
2,Long slide down slippery slope ends in a THUD for Jefferson whatever.,"Jefferson Airplane - White Rabbit - timeless.Fast forward a few years ...(Jefferson) Starship - We Built This City - Ick. And the rest of this album isn't really much better. Oh and BTW, San Fransisco was built a long long time before rock and roll was around (not that I think they want this as their theme song)."
4,Evolution of a great band!!!!,"I speak again, of giving a real if not honest, review of music, unlike others, who just explain why something does not bode well for their own tastes!!! This album represents the Starship very well for the time. It was the 80's for crying out loud!!! All the seeds, once again are there, even without Paul Kantner in the band. Craig Chaquico's playing really shines on songs like ""Tommorrow Doen't Matter Tonight"", ""Rock Myself to Sleep"" and ""Desperate Heart"". The vocals, what can be said, that you can't tell, by just listening. Mickey Thomas and Grace's voices fit nicely together. Mickey is blamed for the Starship's commercial direction, which is just plain stupid!!! Was ""miracles"", from Jefferson Starship's 1975 album, Red Octopus not commercial? Hardly! Besides, it was Paul's idea to get Mickey in the band in 1978, anyway. So he and other people should just realize, that the band was just in the process of evolution, like everything else is in the universe!!!"
2,Past their prime,I grew up in the 80s and always thought this was crap compared to their earlier work. The relatively high overall rating is probably due to the fact that only the people who like the album would take the time to rate it.
2,Garbage . . . but special garbage,"From ""we built this city"" to sara, this stuff stinks from the get go. But, nothing else stinks in the same way. If they're running a good sale, buy it . . . heck its only money. Plus its always in Monte the Air Drummer's rotation."
1,sugary pop as hard to swallow now as when it was new,"For fans of Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship, ""Knee Deep in the Hoopla"" was not ""the real thing"". It was instead a cloying attempt at effervescent pop that went flat while its purveyors were selling out."
3,So horrible it's entertaining,"If you, like me, find humor in extremely hideous 80's music, this is a perfect cd for you. I honestly cannot listen to ten seconds of ""We Built this City"" without a smile gushing from my face. In all practical musical senses, I'd give this cd a resounding 1, but for entertainment purposes, a 5. Average them, and you get 3 stars, just what I rated it.Here's my advice for anyone who buys it on its humor merit: play it in your car as loud as possible while driving through a city. You'll definately turn some heads and get some weird looks. I guess they're just jealous that you're the coolest person in the galaxy!Another great buy is Asia's ""Then and Now."" Between these two cds, you'll have enough over-produced, cheesy 80's music to last you a life time. And you'll never get sick of annoying people with it. Trust me, if you're like me, its well worth it."
3,Perfect Album Title,"For many, there was a whole lot of unnecessary hoopla in the music of the mid 80s. I am not one who thinks that way but if I go with the flow on this then this album is perfectly titled. ""We Built This City"" is an anthemic 80s classic which still gets me humming along today - a brilliant single - quintessential 80s. ""Sarah"" was a capable follow up. ""Tomorrow Doesn't Matter Tonight"" slightly less interesting and less successful. All this was enough to get me to buy the album but it was a little downhill from there. ""Desperate Heart"" is a nice mid-tempo track - typical 80s rock. I liked ""Love Rusts"" as a closer. 27 years later I still have the album. My opinions haven't changed. Mickey Thomas was an awesome singer. The best tracks are knee deep and surrounded by some typical hoopla (filler) but they're still good!"
3,Works but not automaticly,This converter works nicely in manual mode with my Konica-Minolta 5D. The auto focus does not work!
2,Does the job but its not easy,"This and other teleconverters are not for the novice photographer. I expected it to work with AF. Silly me??? I had a heck of a time getting a clear and concise photo and spent a long time playing with it. It works okay if you have the time and expertise to use manual focus. Otherwise, save up for a better magnification lens."
2,It's JUST okay.,"It's fair with cheap price. Don't expect too much. It does extend photo distance but stop 2 F. If your lens is f3.5, it will be f7.0 after adding this unit. You will lose auto focus, ""Manual Focus ONLY""."
1,Only Two Episodes Per Tape!,"There's a reason you won't find an episode listing for this overpriced series of 4 tapes-- there are only two episodes per tape, and you will find few, if any, of your most fondly remembered favorites among the 8 shows duplicated for your enjoyment at the slowest VHS speed, EP, on narrow-hub spools so your VCR will take forever to rewind them.The show's opening theme song's been overdubbed with the *closing* theme song , too.A waste of money."
5,Wonderful book,"I have been waiting all my life for this book! Marc David has finally put all the pieces together to help me understand struggles with weight. His approach is very nurturing, well thought out and extremely helpful."
2,Potentially Interesting time period and siduation......However,"This book has a potentially Interesting time period and situation......However the writing is VERY VERY choppy. I found myself skimming after just 6 pages!!! It reminded me of watching an old super 8 film where the frame is bouncing up and down. The narrator (father) jumps back and fourth in time and interjects all kinds superfluous data and facts that do nothing but get in way of advancing the story.I seriously doubt I will waste my time finishing this novel, too many truly enjoyable reads!"
2,The Cold War and An Even Colder Novel,"Given the Cold War time frame in which this supposed spy novel takes place it could have been very good. Instead, the author offers the reader a very choppy story, awkwardly skipping back & forth. I began to skim the pages wondering when something was going to begin to gel and start coming together.I gave it to page 125 and could not finish it. I came away wondering why it was written in the first place.There's a lot of good works out there without having to squirm through something like this."
3,"Great story, poor history","James Carroll, whose ""Constantine's Sword"" deserves five stars, has screwed up the history of East Germany. It was the Western Allies' currency reform of 1948 that caused the Soviets to set up a government in the east, not arguments going back to 1945. The East German flag was not red, but almost identical to the flag of West Germany, but with a hammer-and-compass seal in the middle.This makes some of the political background to the story awkward, but it's a good spy novel.Secret Father: A Novel"
3,above average,"Mr. Carroll has devised a clever plot although the writing style leaves something to be desired, in my opinion.I tired of the frequent and repetitive references to the various characters emotional issues. Also, I found the several of the characters' actions and statements to be inconsistent and lacking in believability. One minute a character is mousy, the next he is taking charge. One such episode on the part of one of the characters would have been OK, but not several times on the parts of several characters."
1,poor design,"Hard/impossible to get to the short-lived battery. Strap breaks easily & attached poorly. Black background is very hard to read. Domed ""crystal"" is prone to scratch. Garbage in under a year. I'll never buy a Nike watch again."
1,Band will eventually break,"The band on this watch will break. This is because the metal-to-plastic resin which connects the plastic band to te metal face wears off eventually-no matter how lightly the watch is used. Even under the lightest usage, at least on band will just fall off within 12-13 months. Because of this, I now bought the Nike Triax Fury model. Its band seems to be a unitary one from one end to the other (no glue!). If you want a Nike watch like this, get one of the Fury models."
2,I wanted to like this,"I have had two of these watches, that's how desperately I wanted to like them because of the style. However, as a runner, they are just not built to take...well..running! The plastic strap *will* be pulled away from the clock eventually. It has happened to both my watches. The color rubs off of the plastic as well, so whatever color you get, it will eventually be a dirty gray. Also, as noted, it is very difficult to read, especially while racing--the numbers are not contrasted well. Lastly, the buttons are not easily depressed, so I have missed many split times. Unless you're using this just for a showpiece, don't get it!"
3,What was Nike thinking?,"I have to agree with the other reviews about the watch display on the W0085-004 model, the white letters on a black background are just awful to read. The watch features are just fine and I paid almost nothing for my watch, so I'll be keeping it. If the price I'd paid had been any higher it would be going back. If they'd made the reversed display a user settable option I'd give it a sure 4 stars (the numbers are still ugly)"
1,How can you not mention Jesus 1 time!?,My son love Caillou. He loves this movie. I don't want it or expect it to be a religous movie but how can you have a movie mainly about Christmas and not once mention Jesus!
1,Disappointed,This movie only played through once. The second time it kept freezing and is not watchable. This was the second time we bought this DVD because my daughter loved it. The same thing happened to the first one too.
4,A cute Holiday Movie for young kids,If you like Caillou then this holiday movie is a must. It's long enough but not too long to lose them. My kids enjoy watching this from Thanksgiving thru New Year's.
5,Great for preschoolers!,"The Caillou Holiday Movie is not only over an hour of Caillou fun (my kids are Caillou fans) but is a terrific holiday story filled with good laughs and lots of charm. The fun that Caillou and his pals get into over the holidays is exactly what my kids want to do over the holidays, tobogganing, parties and lots of yummy things to eat! Caillou's Holiday Movie is simple, charming fun."
4,Cute MOvie,This is a very cute movie. My 4 yr. loves how it has no commercials(No 10 minute talking sessions of his cat and teddy bear) This movie is very adorable!
3,le encanta a mi hijo,"Las aventuras de Caillou en Navidad, y sus diversas formas de celebrarlas, son la delicia de mi pequeño hijo. Lamentablemente el doblaje que utilizaron en este disco no utiliza las voces conocidas de los personajes pero no llegan malograr la historia.Es un buen motivo para pasar en casa un momento agradable y de sano entretenimiento para los pequeños."
5,Caillou is a hit,"We purchased this Christmas Dvd for our grandkids who are 4 and 2,they love watching Caillou his sister Rosie and play school friends and family.fromNana and Pap"
4,Our 2 yr old loves Caillou!!,"Our 2 yr old has watched this movie over and over and over to the point it has started to skip. I know Caillou has become a big deal in alot of toddlers homes and this movie alone is a great buy!! Good music and episodes! Our toddler is happy with it so we are happy with it too! Our 9 month old also enjoys the movie. Yes he is kind of young but the music, colors and Caillou's cute voice draws his attention to it :-) Only negative about this product is that we would have enjoyed more songs on it showing the words at the bottom of the screen."
5,Great Movie,"My son loves Caillou and this video is no different. I have not personally sat and watched this through (I bought it so I could set him up in another room so I didn't have to watch it for 8 hours a day!) but I have watched a LOT of Caillou and for small children it is a great show. It has everyday situations, with Caillou's parents, grandparents, play school, little sister, pets, etc....that I think are great teachers for the ""real world"" even for small children. Great learning tool. Highly recommend."
4,my kids fav movie,"my three year old insists on watching this marginally animated pseudo-movie, even in the summer time. whatever floats his boat, right? great purchase on my (santa's) part, right? right?"
1,deceptive ad,the ad showed 10 books. but he was only selling one. it did not tell you which one. so i bought a book i already have. it made you think you were getting the whole set because that's what was pictured.
3,Don't bother..,"I ordered the guide along with the actual book and really never did use it. It may be cheap, but I think the book itself should be enough."
3,"Will not work without ""Trading for a Living...""","Not as advertised, this book will not work alone -, and the added value will not be that much You need to have the book ""Trading for a Living: Psychology, Trading Tactics, Money Management"" and the combination will be great. ..."
4,study guide,I made a mistake and thought I was getting the book. I finally have the book and this guide may help.
5,If you're in for a laugh.,"Dude, this was one of the funniest movies I have seen lately. Kind of like Ichi The Killer funny."
4,Awesome As$ kicking action!,This is a great movie for anyone who likes lots of action surrounded by great actors and a good story line. This movie is unique and Park Seung-tae is amazing in this film!
1,Not really my cup of tea,"I got this thinking it was one thing and found quickly that it is definitely not what I thought. So, the book itself maybe fine, but due to my preconceptions, I did not like it at all. This is probably not a fair review of the content"
2,Pretty stupid,"This book is totally unreal. It is not very well written either. The plot is about two girls who read an advice columm for teens, so therefore are very excited about getting to meet her. Then they find out she's not perfect in every way, so they try to change her life so people will like her. One includes sneaking into her house. Like they wouldn't get in trouble! like I said, unreal."
2,Not impressed,Did not feel like the product did anything. It made my smelly couch just smell like a WET smelly couch. Was not impressed.Only thing I liked about it was the fine spray...
4,Entertaining Book,"I have been enjoying all of the Rex Stout books I have received so far, but this one was especially entertaining. All three stories were well written, and very entertaining."
4,fun for kids,"I have to say that cartoons have changed since my days this series i got them for my nephew and he is a Ben 10 fan they are very entertaining and fun to watch ""i saw a few episodes"" its action an some comedy cartoons if this is your combination for fun get this collection for your kids"
2,Same old,"well,.. i was hoping to see more variations of aliens,.. alas, its same old,...same old,...."
3,Its not bad,Really nice to be able to play this for about an hour for my boy episode after episode he never gets tired of watching.
2,for my husband,got this for my husbands birthday. for $23 I expected a nice towel. this is just a very thin beach towel . not too satisfied. but oh well
1,"I have heard them all, too....","The 6th is my favorite Bruckner symphony and I have heard the entire catalog of this symphony, but this one is the worst. It is a difficult one to interpret, and there are only a few really good ones. This recording, though, is not Bruckner. It misses the essence of the piece. One star is one too many...."
2,Ist movement fine...but downhill from there!!!,"The recent performance of Bruckner 6 on Teldec of Barenboim led me to this particular recording of Bruckner's rather strange A minor work once again...for sure here we have a nicely balanced recording but I find the string work a bit feeble...again not the best combination in a work that requires a great string ensemble.\I have long admired Barenboim and Klemperer in this work because at least they don't drag the proceedings so much as Tintner does. Naxos sound is good ...but certainly not any better than the previous DG record with Barenboim. Come on DG, get off you butts and re-release a great Chicago performance of this piece!!!"
4,Complex and satisfying,"After the first several pages, I almost gave up. Reading italics seems so gimicky and needless. But no - it's a sly and clever way to make you see the story from two points of view, the doctor's and the patient's. The time period is interesting, the characters are interesting, the plot, while simple enough, has a true feeling. I would slow down, savor this, enjoy."
5,Amaya's Love,My daughter loves Teen Wolf and buying this for her kept her off of my computer trying to download each episode now all I need is the other seasons as they are completed and I will forever be her hero. If it makes my daughter this happy and knowing her friends I'm sure I would recommend this to another parent for their child.
4,Don't be chased off because of the cover.,This is an amazingly great fun show. I don't know what they were thinking when they put on the cover to the DVD set. Please ignore the crappy cover. The show is a must own!!! And the special effects.... Very sweet.
5,"Love, love, love.",I love this show. When I first saw the previews for it I thought it looked really cheesy to go along with some bad acting. I was wrong. I literally watched the first season in one day. I love the characters and their personalities. Most shows now-a-days have the main characters say really stupid stuff and do weird things that teenager dont actually do(a good example of that is Shanke It Up on Disney). But this show doesn't! My favorite character is Stiles. He is hilarious and pretty much makes the show.The second season is even better than the first and I will soon be purchasing it here in the near furture.
5,Love it!,I love it! It has everything I thought it would have and more. I would definitely recommend buying this to any fan of the show or avid watcher of supernatural based shows. It's a must have and I can't wait till season 2 becomes available for pre-order.
4,Fun reboot of the series,"I caught a few of these episodes on TiVo and enjoyed them - there's a simple quality to the story and some flavor of the old movie from the 80s. The major differences are that it's a lot darker, more aggressive and full of sexy people. The story in ""enhanced"" by a lot of shirtless scenes of the main male characters, who are, of course, hot. As I enjoyed it on TV but didn't get to see the whole series from start to finish, I decided to get this on Amazon, and am glad I did.If you liked the old movie, like werewolves and sexy actors, you'll like this series too."
4,fun series,"I've read the negative reviews and thought 'really?' This is a great summer series and exactly what I expected it to be- a teenage soap opera with the supernatural overlaid on it. The werewolves are fun though I would like to know if they can change to full wolf form. I love the writers decided to use la crosse instead of football for the main high school sport.The characters are fun and, as the season progressed, moved beyond their stereotypes into real characters. The bad guy's backgtround is not typical and, in fact, in most shows he'd be the hero or at least the anti-hero. Instead here he is unredeemedly evil. Plus the characters run into some real problems and not just the usual teen angst (though there is a fair share of that-unavoidable for a show about teens). I recommend this series for anyone who wants to spend some time watching a series which is fun without being heavy or too dramatic. A great way to pass an evening."
4,Another '80s movie more successful as a TV series,"All of the good press this show is getting reminds me of a bad '90s movie with a horror twist which was turned into a highly successful TV series - ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer""! I think ""Teen Wolf"" could be the next genre success!!!"
5,teen wolf by adriana m. grenot,"Hi my name is adriana,I stared watching teen wolf and im hook on it,I cant believe its going to end i wish m t.v. would keep it on all year,please let me know when the first season comes to dvd i want to buy it,its a great show!:)"
2,DVD container was shattered and cracked,"DVDs plastic holder was broken in several pieces and cracked on bottom and couldn't hold the DVDs in place. DVDs miraculously were not damaged so we didn't exchange. This was a birthday present. So, kind of disappointing. This was the first time I had any problem with Amazon. They are very accurate and prompt. The packaging was lacking."
5,Teen wolf,"Didn't think I would be as into this series as I am but I'm hooked. This is the perfect blend of romance, action, and suspense."
4,Great eye candy,"Great show with a good story line. The characters have been well developed throughout season one and there's enough cliffhanger at the end of each season to make you want to continue watching. The special effects are a bit silly but overall it works. And the eye candy isn't bad either! Not as much skin as found on True Blood but given the channel and audience, it is enough. My only issue was with disc two getting stuck on one episode and I had to finagle around with the DVD player to get it to continue playing. Can't wait for season two to come out."
1,Needs to be Blu-ray with digital copy 5 star show 1 star product,Think it is a great show and want to buy it but I will buy all seasons the day they are Blu-ray with digital copy (itunes compatible) millions of Mac and PC users can't be wrong lol - actually goes for all Video product (HBO and Disney have already come to senses not sure why some like MTV and FX are resisting) and up front UV or Ultraviolet (without digital copy as well) is a no not going to buy for any reason so they loose all sales
5,love it,love this show and it was alot cheaper on here than in stores. Everything came in tact and there werent any scrathes or anything on the disc
5,Teen Wolf,This is an awesome series. Very well written. You really feel what the characters are going through just trying to grow up.
5,SURPRISINGLY GREAT!,"Since I grew up on the original Teen Wolf movie with Michael J Fox, and I am completely addicted to The Vampire Diaries, I gave this new series a shot. I am SO glad I did! THIS SHOW IS GREAT! It has some of the same elements from the original movie (like characters Scott & Styles) but instead of it being a comedy, it's more intense and dark like Vampire Diaries. Check out this series... it has a great storyline and will keep you entertained! P.S. Season Two starts up this summer on MTV!!"
4,Teen Wolf,"I thihk the cover could have been much better. Can also say the same for my last marriage. However, some of those characters in Teen Wolf looks like someone I was married to. Sounds like her too. But I think it was a great show and look forward to the next series. Liked Tyler Posey as Raul in Doc...but, they all grow up. And of course, Tyler Hoechlen(sic) was great in 7th Heaven and Road to Perdition. Great show. I never pictured these two later on playing this genre."
4,"Good, but there's better","Have just about everything by Rory, so I thought i'd get this to round out the collection. Maybe I need to listen to it again, but first spin didn't hit me. Some music I've bought does not click until the second or third try. That said, Rory is one of my favorite musicians. You really can't miss with him. I Listen to his albums often."
3,Ordinary,"I bought this one for my brother who's been looking for it for years. To me, it sounds like plain rock'n'roll. Sometimes very bluesy... even though the best track is the bonus ballad Easy Come Easy Go.What annoys me are Rory's vocals. Not really a superb singer, and this kinds of downlevels the otherwise OK rock'n'roll.Jinx is mainly for Rory Gallagher fans! The CD booklet says it's symbolic for a difficult phase in his life, so maybe the fans will get much more out of the lyrics and the music."
1,Undeserving of a Rating Higher than 1,"A Color of Love follows the lives of John and Harriet starting from high school through old age. One would think there might be a lot of material covered in the book. Not! This book ended up being nothing more than a quick summary of a relationship as ""read"" by the author to the reader. It was one of the worst stories I've read thusfar. There was nothing there to maintain this reader's interest.The story starts out with two people residing in the South who fall in love, but happen to be of different races. Like I said before, the author rushes through what should be a story, so there is no real story. If there is no substance, how can there be a climactic moment? Get my point?One wouldn't even want to bother with this one. If I could rate it lower than the number 1, I would."
3,Go with another brand,"Don't waste your money on this model. I had it for about 9 months and it was nothing but trouble. First the screen started going blank, then the battery wouldn't hold the charge. I've decided not to waste my time with the customer service and bought a Panasonic set, which I am very happy with. Now I have 2 sets of broken Uniden sets in the closet. I can't even throw them out because I can't erase phone numbers from the caller ID."
5,one of the funniest movies ever,Who would have thought a story so sweet could be so funny? There are people in my life that I all I have to say is the beginning of Bob's name and they're cracking up....Bob Oloogah ....great flick!
5,BOB MALOOGA LOOGA LOOGA LOOGA LOOGA,"I MYSELF AND ALL MY FAMILY ADORE THIS FILM. MY BROTHER AND I RE-INACT ALL SCENES(DOG GO WOOF WOOF,YOU MUST REMEMBER THIS) AND MANY MORE TO MENTION AS WE KNOW THE WORDS OFF BY HEART. THIS JUST HAS TO BE RELEASED ON TO DVD PLEASE. I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO GET A COPY OF IT- GOT IT ON VHS WHICH WE RECORDED OFF SKY BUT ITS WEARING OUT."
1,horrible movie,"this movie is so bad you would have to watch Plane 9 from Outer space to see one that is worse. Acting is horrible, writing is horrible, camera work is horrible....the entire movie is horrible. Best use for this DVD is as a coaster."
4,This CD is a keeper! Underrated singer!,This is the version of 'Beautiful Collision' with a bonus 7-track CD which I highly recommend purchasing!If you felt the original 12 track was too short- then buy this version for more great songs!It is worth it for the B-sides 'Gracie' and 'You Don't Want To Know' which are dreamy. Bic really puts her heart into every song and they have a melody you will be whistling for days...much to the annoyance of your family and friends!'Question To Ask Me' is a country-and-western tinged ballad which is interesting but doesn't seem to get anywhere.'Good Morning Baby' was on the 'American Pie' soundtrack and is pretty good...although you can hardly hear Bic's voice over Dan Wilson.The other two tracks are live versions of 'Something Good' and 'Listening For The Weather'. The only problem is they sound exactly the same as the studio album versions. I guess they prove what great pitch Bic has and how none of her songs are overly-produced to make her voice sound better.
5,Bic's brilliant sophomore album,"Bic Runga is a singular talent: She's got a beautiful, versatile voice, strong musicianship, and great lyrical skills. In this age of cookie-cutter female singer-songwriters, she stands out as truly unique. Bic wrote and produced the album which features star-studded musicians such as Neil Finn, Dave Dobbyn, and Sebastian Steinberg. Her first CD was excellent, but 'Beautiful Collision' stands out a bit more because of the production and arrangements. I hear the influence of old jazz standards, 70's California pop songs, Bjork, and the Beatles on this album. Bic's talent shines because she manages to synthesize all of these disparate influences into her own peerless style.My favorite songs are the first single 'Get Some Sleep', which is an ironic ode to touring, 'The Be All End All', a beautiful country waltz, and 'Election Night' a mid-tempo rocker.There's not a bad song on this album, which shouldn't surprise anyone who's a fan of Bic."
5,An excellent and beautiful album,"I recently bought my Beautiful Collision album while in New Zealand and over the past 3 months have proceeded to fall in love with every song on it. Bic is clearly a very talented songwriter and singer with an amazing vocal range and distinctive voice. Her songs contain a lovely range of themes and I would reccomend the bonus album that comes with Beautiful Collision as well. The lyrics are really worth listening to, they can be sung to or the music can just play in the background to create a really comfortable and rich atmosphere."
2,Kind of boring...,"After lisening to a couple of tracks everything becomes blured and repetitious, dreamy and boring, and the woman child voice does not do any good. I do not understand all the buzz around her."
3,nothing special,"why is everyone raving about this? all the tracks sound the same, there isn't anything to catch you and sweep you along. Good for background music?"
4,"Nice, not excellent.","If you are going to buy this album, I suggest you to not be influenced by all the rumour about this artist made by her record company, you could be disappointed.Cause she's nothing more than a... (sometimes) talented writer, but nothing more. This album has some great track (I bouth it mainly for GET SOME SLEEP, but I also love WHEN I SEE YOUR SMILE, THE BE AND ALL END, HONEST GOODBYES), but most of them are just.. anonymus, ""normal"" the same way her voice is. It's a sort of New Zealand Norah Jones, but only from far.Anyway, I don't think that for the only track that I like it worths the price.. Before you decide 2 buy it, just listen to 4/5 song. If you don't like them, try something else, you won't loose your money."
2,CHEAP,"I REALLY regret buying these. I gave it an extra star because it has a good eraser.BIC Mechanical Pencil with Metallic Color Barrels 0.7mm 18ct, Black (MPLMP18-Blk)My reccomendation is in the link above."
4,Practical Tips,"This book approaches life holistically. She views responsibilities in various arenas and addresses how to organize effectively for better time management across the board. Before doing that she establishes the value of doing so by listing 12 good reasons to get organized. That list begins with ""it fosters responsibility"" and ends with ""we deserve serene surroundings."" In the book she discusses how one can turn waiting time into productive time. She mentions dreams as being revelations from the subconscious. In the section on paper three categories are given: pitch it, process it, or put it away. In advocating change, she cites a Chinese proverb, ""if we do not change our direction, we are likely to end up where we are headed."" This is a ""hands on"" book designed for people who want to change and become better organized."
5,Loved It,"I found the story line to be light hearted in spite of the ""suspense."" I loved the characters, going back to the same little town. The secondary romance was nicley done and a very nice addition to the main romance with Hannah and Tanner.The story flowed together nicley and kept you hanging in there.I really enjoyed this book and have recommended it already."
5,From Eforicity the Insten Brand screen protectors works as described,"Younger brother just got the verizon chocolate. He's been know to show it off and got his hold phones all scratched up. Its a good phone and he uses as an mp3 player but I digress. The screen protect works as described, it comes with a polish cloth and a plasting squeegee aplicator. The film has some kind of electrostatic polymer, there's no adhesive but once you peel off both sides it seals right on to the screen. Squeegee help to get out 1 air bubble that formed.I would recommend."
1,Not worth it,"It's the little plastic ""shield"" that comes on your phone when you first purchase it. Didn't realize that when I bough this product. You get a few of them, but the one I put on my phone immediately began to peel off already. I've only had it about a month or so. It helps a bit, but you're better off buying a nifty carrying case for your phone instead."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"The design of this screen protector has changed, it is NOT the same as what is pictured here. It is stiff plastic, one piece design that partially wraps around the navigation wheel. It's ill fitting to begin with, but the adhesive isn't strong enough to hold it in place. It didn't even last one day. I purchased two, and the other one was the same flawed design. My emails to the seller went unanswered, I just wasted my money on something that went in the trash at the end of the day. The next day I went to my cell phone company and purchased a far better quality screen protector for $1.00. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!"
4,Great buy!,"Protects the screen really well, would have been nice if there was a clear covering for the whole phone."
2,It works but not exactly what I thought I was getting,"The screen protectors I received were actually for a different type of phone. Maybe for something with an inner and outer screen? The Chocolate only has one. Although one of the protectors that came will cover the important part of the Chocolate screen. So far it has worked and not peeled, so if you're not a perfectionist it's a decent buy."
1,Remington Powder Actuated Tool 476,I bought this tool a few years back and I could never get it to fire. When I needed it and it wouldn't fire I went another way with the project. I owned one earlier and it worked great until it disappeared. The new one doesn't appear to have a firing pin. The plate that strikes the cartridges is slightly concave without any protruding parts. I just went online to determine if a safety feature requires me to unscrew the top bolt to access and remove the concave plate so it would work. No such directions. Oops....Remington must have forgotten the firing pin. The Remington quality is suffering.
3,Works ok,"On the first shot, the little bullet popped out of the guide hole (The barrel) and was squished sideways in the chamber. It went off and I 'think' it damaged it. I'm thinking this because it would never fire again....until I made a little plate about the size of a quarter with a weld bead in the center as a firing pin. I then used it for an entire project. It seems to be built pretty solid and I can't figure exactly what happened when it broke. I'm still using it with my special firing pin. I'm not sure if it was the shells, the concrete, or the gun but several times it took two shots to get the nail to fully penetrate."
5,trumpet & voice,Are you one of those who's favorite movement from Messiah is 'Trumpet Shall Sound'? Then this is for you! Beautiful interplay of trumpet and soprano.
2,Not too happy,I asked for a larger hat and never heard from the company again. someone contacted me and said another hat would be available in a larger size. I have heard nothing. so I am stuck with something I will never use.Mary Ann Grymala
2,Sub-par performance by Mannheim Steamroller,"I'm a big fan of Mannheim Steamroller, and a proud Husker, so I thought I would love this product.Instead, only 1 song appears to relate to Nebraska at all, and the performance seems ""phoned in."" Save your money and buy the Nebraska state song for 99 cents somewhere, and a couple of tracks from any Fresh Aire album. That will be money better spent."
5,Excellent gift for non-Orthodox friends or relatives,"As fairly recent converts to the Orthodox Christian Church, my husband and I have given away nearly a dozen copies of this small booklet (really more like a large brochure) to friends and family members. It's not nearly as intimidating as a full-length book, and it gives a clear, interesting, and accurate introduction to the Church--as well as telling why we in America know so little about it. Highly recommended!"
5,Enjoy!,I have these stories in two separate books. I read the first one then looked for a sequel in hopes that there was one. I was pleasantly surprised to find it and that Elizabeth and Rue have their own story and meet again for one last time. I have reread and reread these stories. They are good escapes especially with what I have had to deal with. Makes one want to go back somewhere in time also.
4,"Good, but not much character depth","I liked the two stories, but quite honestly, there is too much in the book that really does not have anything to do with the story. This doesn't give much room for strong character development which most of Miller's books have."
4,An Inside Look Into Adoption In Kazakhstan,"My guess is that if you are considering purchasing this video then you are also considering adopting from Kazakhstan and wanting to see what it is like to travel there and go through a little of the process. This video does a great job at showing some of the emotions, challenges, and ups-and-downs of adopting there. You will see what one of the orphanages is like and also a little bit of the country. The video quality is not professional and I would have liked to have seen more introduction to the couple since I know NOTHING about them. It also doesn't show much about the adopted child's first days in the USA which would have been helpful. Overall, it is an interesting documentary and I recommend it to anyone considering adoption from that part of the world."
3,Good popular science for a teenager,"This book does a very good job of telling the story of a very minor piece of scientific research, the discovery of yet another species of large dinosaur (of which there are many) and the geological context in which it may have lived. Thus, as science, it is small potatoes. It does, however, cast the tale in the midst of a good review of elementary geology and paleontology, and consequently, should be accessible even to those who the read the book starting in complete ignorance of those fields. It fails to credit the Alvarezes (a physicist and a geologist) by name for finding out what happened to the dinosaurs, but that may only be the paleonotologist's resentment at having their best puzzle stolen from them by a physicist who didn't dug up so much as a single fossilized bone.Overall, this is a book for fifteen year olds, but it is a good one."
2,Kind of Long-Winded,"One would not think it that surprising to discover that dinosaur fossils had been discovered within the Sahara Desert of Egypt, considering the immense history this country already has, but apparently from an archaeological perspective, this is pretty rare. What is even more amazing is that these dinosaur fossils were actually the largest ever found. Yet they remain relatively unknown due to the stupid efforts of archaeologists and patrons during the early twentieth century when they were discovered. Sadly, this book lacks in that it could be a third shorter and pertain more to the actual subject at hand than going on fictional tangents. It creates a question of what is real and what is not, most important in the study of fossils many millions of years old.Originally published on November 25th, 2002.Go to BookBanter [...] for over five hundred reviews and over forty exclusive author interviews, and more."
1,Not that much of a dinosaur book,"This may be of interest to serious paleontologist or those interested in obscure details of World War II, but it makes for a long and somewhat boring book. My son, who loves dinosaurs and reading, couldn't finish it, and I can see why. Should have been an article in National Geographic or the like."
3,Not Bad,"The much-balyhooed Wildcats revamp by Scott Lodbell and Travis Charest was quickly forgotten when Charest's deadline woes made the book notoriously late. However, once fans look beyond that particluar issue, they will find a very entertaining story with excellent art (and not only by Charest). Although this isn't as good as the title would later become under Joe Casey, it's a more than adequate introduction to the updated Wildcats world and a perfect jumping on point for non-WildC.A.T.s fans."
2,Rip Off,"Normally, I wouldn't have considered buying a WildCATS book, but since this particular one advertised that it had art by Travis Charest, I couldn't resist. The guy it talented!Of course, it turns out only two and a half out of five (or is it six?) of the stories in the book are drawn by 'ol Travis, the rest being done by fill in artists who have no where nears the same level of talent.That, and if you actually bother to read the stories you'll find that the compilation seems pointless as nothing is resolved."
4,"teaches how to use, but look elsewhere for why","You need to already know the ideas behind aspect orient programming [AOP}, before opening this book. Plus a fluency in Java, by the way. While I have the latter fluency, I'd only met AOP briefly in a few papers.Under the familiar O'Reilly cookbook format, the book has guidelines on various difficulties you might be having, when running AspectJ. It's a superset of Java. The new syntax is not so difficult to learn. True, it's more involved than writing a new class, that conforms to existing Java syntax. But a good Java programmer should quickly grasp how to implement crosscuts or advice.As to the broader issue of whether you should use AOP at all, the book is silent. It tells you well how to use AOP in the form of AspectJ. But you need to decide, based on externalities, whether to take it up at all."
4,sick ish,"I dont know why anyone would not like this album if they are fans of louis logic. jay rips it as well but you can tell louis in on another level. i think the beats are also hype. fun cd, offensive to others, pure logic. Sick. 14 is the best song, just tight."
5,NIV STUDENT BIBLE,"I have bought this Bible for many, many people, and they have all been pleased with it. The notes also help understanding and life appliation."
3,Not what I Thought,"The books arrived in a timely manner for which I thank you very much; however, you pictured them as having a black cover but we received the ones with a more recent colorful cover. We were a bit disappointed as a customer wanted the black covers, but graciously accepted the newer ones. Please, try to have the picture match the items for the future.Thank you for your consideration."
3,NIV student bible,"I expected the ""leather bound"" to be a little nicer. This would have been a complaint if I had bought it new. I guess for the price I shouldn't have expected more."
3,Some of the Commentary Needs Editing,"I have no problem with the actual Bible portion of this book, but the commentary could defnitely use a bit of editing. In 1 Samuel alone, we read ""The Israelites was fighting for survival"" in the introduction, and later, in one of the little commentary snippets, the editors misidentify a conversation between David and Saul as one between David and Jonathan. While people who have a decent understanding of the Bible can simply roll their eyes at things like this, those who don't know it so well may be confused and turned off. If you're just looking for an NIV, this works, but I'd skip it in favor of another student Bible."
5,Easy to read and understand - good for teens or newbies,Looking for an appropriate Bible for study is frustrating when half of them at the store are shrink-wrapped. I took a chance on this and was pleased. Intelligently written and with good notes. I would hope that the authors continue to update this book over the years. I would certainly buy each new version for teaching my teen Bible study classes.
5,It will grab your heart and not let go,"This was Lancaster's last film, made when he was dying, as was the character he portrays. He is the widowed patriarch of a close-knit clan, who has reluctantly agreed to honor his dead wife's wish that he be buried next to her. But what his heart dreams of is a classic Viking funeral--his body sent out to sea and set alight as the sun sets. His enterprising and resourceful grandchildren are determined to find a way to fulfill his dying wish. A warm, delightful and very touching film. END"
5,The epitome of life and death in modern society,Burt Lancaster's portrayal of a dying patriarch provides hope for those concerned with the decline of the family and the loss of individuality. The quintessential setting on Long Island appeals to those attracted to the sea while attempting to savor the remnants of life. The perfect film for self-reflection and hope for a gratifying end to life on this earth. Required viewing!
2,NOT a great family movie!,"I am very liberal and am happy to explain things to my 4 year old daughter. That being said, we watched this together tonight after reading all the glowing reviews that it was a great family movie. Perfect, I thought, it would keep us both entertained. Hardly.There was so much sexual innuendo that my daughter had questions the entire movie about what was going on with the adults and although I knew that there was a death at the end *spoiler alert* the kids actually steal grandpa's body to give him the funeral he had told them about a week earlier??? How utterly bizarre of a twist and I watched in horror as they dropped his body down the stairs and sent his body out to sea without their parents.Acting was good, but definitely not a plot line I would recommend as a family movie."
5,Excellent condition,My mother has been looking for this older classic for many years. I was so glad to order it for her. Thank you for the quick delivery and DVD was in great condition as stated. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!!
2,The original recordings were better,"This CD looks like an Elvis fan's dream, because of the song titles. However, many are new/different versions with less energy. The whole CD really drags. I traded it to a used CD store and am rebuying the original CDs instead now."
4,A clarification?,"In case you're confused by some of the comments, this isn't strictly a best-of Costello set. This is a thematic compilation that happens to better approximate a best-of set than any other that is available.As far as I know, your options are to buy the single-CD Very Best-Of (not nearly enough songs, but an OK start), the 2 1/2 years set (3 full copies of his earliest and best albums plus a live CD of these same CDs plus some fantastic demo and acoustic cuts), or this one.Short of buying 10 or more CDs and making your own compilation, this is the set with the widest range of excellent cuts from most of his work. Just keep in mind that some of the most popular titles aren't here, such as 'Radio, Radio', 'Everyday I Write The Book', 'Less Than Zero', 'Peace, Love, & Understanding', etc."
5,Just Excellent,"A sharp, subtle gem; I picked up a VHS copy somewhere in my travels and finally got around to watching it. Because it is VHS there is a faded quality to the production which interestingly enhances the film as it is a faded story in a faded time. Ah, but the dialogue - the interactions and interplay of the characters - smacks you upside your head with its wit and its thought. No fading there."
1,Hotel du Lac,Could not play it on my DVD player. have contacted the company it came from. Have yet to send it back. That is time consuming. They claim it said on the explanation. I don't remember reading. I will be careful about ordering from another company I have ordered many times from amazon.C. Rowley
1,Searching for new medicines in the rain forest? What?,I believe that the author of this book should review it. I did not fine any searching in this book.
4,I Was Hooked,"I loved this book. What a gift it was to read about the forest people and their plants. Although I had a little trouble getting into it at first, I eventually found myself thinking about the book during the day. I was anxious to get back to the story. The author is a talented writer; he brings the rainforest to life with his wonderful descriptions. And, hey, he's a botanist, not a full-time writer. I appreciate the effort he took to fully relate his experience with the Indians, and I thank him for helping me with my own book (I read this as research)."
2,medicinal plants,"this book was interesting, names of plants were difficult even for the instructor to pronounce. I was a bit disappointed as a non- ethnobotanist major, why this book was used in an introductory class that we will most likely not ever travel to the rain forest"
5,"Fabulous, worldly book!!","Mark Plotkin does a fabulous job of reminding his readers that Western culture is not necessarily a superior culture. Plotkin weaves botany,history, anthropology, and medicine into an exquisite tapestry that gives the reader and understanding of Amerindian culture and the forces affecting the rainforests. If you think ethnobotany would be a boring topic, give this book a chance. You will be thrilled that you did!"
1,A misleading book,"What I wonder is what is in Plotkin's mind when he calls himself ""a shaman's apprentice"". Is he serious, is he trying to pretend he is someone else, or is the title of this book a figment of publisher's imagination with no fault of Mark's?! I guess we will never know.Plotkin was one of the early people cashing in on the emerging fascination with the Amazon and indigenous peoples. The book tells us how he went to Amazon after dropping out of Harvard, becoming fascinated with biodiversity as well as cognizant of the perils of encroaching civilization. The book is not shy about the fact that his trip to Amazon was to exploit its bountiful pharmacopeia rather than to 'save the planet' and it was only after his commercial pharmacological venture failed that Plotkin became a champion of the planet. He needs to be given credit for how quickly he recognized the opportunity of 'ecological warriorism'. This book is a harbinger of the era of eco-NGOs and feel-do-goodism."
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"Could not put this down. I collect tropical plants and was hoping for oodles of info on medicinal plants and there uses--which this has--but it's richest aspect is hearing about the experience of the jungle, the disappearing Amazonian cultures (at times very hard to hear), the interesting situations Plotkin finds himself in, and the individuals he becomes friends with."
3,"Item was ordered as a VHS tape, was sent DVD","Ordered the movie in VHS format. because unfortunately will doze off occasionally or find scene I would like to see or review again and VHS tape give me the option of stopping and rewinding or fast forwarding to the specific point in tape. In my biased opinion DVD's are a pain in the a-- and I rarely buy one. This version of the Hunchback was not as good as the Charles Laughin version, never the less worth watching if a Victor Hugo fan."
4,Very good movie,This is a very good movie! It is one of the better tales of the HUnchback of Notre Dame. The characters Anthony Hopkins and Lesley-Anne Down both play their parts really well.
3,Not what I expected,"My daughter loves Eric Carles' The Hungry Caterpillar and The Grouchy Ladybug; to give my husband and I a break at bedtime reading, I bought this book. The poems are not children's poems as I assumed, so this does not hold my 2 1/2 yr old's attention. It'll be great when she's older; definitely recommend for older children, just disappointed that we're back to the Hungry Caterpillar and Grouchy Ladybug until I get another one."
2,Pretty pictures,"If you are just looking for a picture book of animals, this is fine. We received this as part of our Sonlight curriculum, and I really thought it was pointless. The kids didn't even like it."
2,"Likely a good grill, but description is wrong","Only has a 10,000 BTU burner. The description says 20,000. I never opened it and instead spent a little more money on the Cuisinart."
2,sharp edges,"I returned this grill. It had sharp edges which may injure the owner. Also the grates were not removable, so it would be very difficult to clean them. We were quite disappointed with the grill. It didn't put out enough heat to cook a steak. I guess you got what you paid for in this case.."
1,Disappointed,"Yes this grill was less expensive than many out there, so I couldn't possibly expect this to be the best out there. However, I was camping in cold rainy weather this weekend. I was grilling some burgers on high, when all of a sudden flames shot out from the closed lid as if it was going to blow up. There were flames also coming out from the bottom hole and lighting my wood table on fire. When investigating what to do, the adjustable lever you tell how high you want it was frozen with ice. The only way to turn this off was to pull the propane off. I restarted thinking this was some fluke...however it started to ice the lever again. Def to cheap to use."
1,Buy something else!!,"The grill started fine, but after running for a short time, the flames got much higher. The gas regulator in the temperature control was malfunctioning. I felt the valve and it was ice cold. Apparently this regulator freezes and sticks. Turning it off had no effect. I unscrewed the gas bottle to stop it. Not a smart thing to do, but nothing else worked. I notice the Weber ""Go Anywhere"" has a similar valve, so I ordered one on ebay for around 20 bucks shipping included and will try that. The grill is constructed OK, stainless lasts a long time. Hope this works. It's Chinese, so. no hope of money back. Strongly advise not buying it."
1,DANGER,"The product is dangerous. My husband had it burning out in the driveway and the flame started climbing and climbing--he could not turn it off. He eventually had to kick off the gas cylinder or it would have exploded. It also claims that you can you can use the larger tank--well, you can't!"
1,they never emailed me back,"I bought the grill for my boyfriend for our anniversary. I had ordered it a month before our special day, so it was hiding in the closet for a while. I didn't bother to open it to check, which was a big mistake. So the special day came and we sat down and he opened the box, the outside box was fine, but the box for the actual grill was dented. When we pulled the grill out, we noticed that the grill was dented as well, and it was missing a nut to screw the propane pipe. I had contacted the company and they never emailed me back. And the only message I received was that Amazon was reviewing the case.Buy at your own risk people."
2,no grease pan,"The grill is ok in a pinch. It does not have a grease pan to catch drippings, therefore can only be used where such drips are not problematic. I thought I could use it on my boat. No way!Grease on the deck of a boat can be disasterous.It is best used for camping, were you can set it on the ground.The maker should add a grease pan and mounting bracket to the bottom of the unit, and compete with marine units costing 350 percent more. They would sell like hot cakes."
1,Bad Product,"I had this product for one day. I opened the box and found no instructions. There were parts missing. Also I purchased it for use on my boat. I found out that the only part of it that was stainless was the burner.So, I returned it the next day."
2,decent product with some short coming's,"I have had this grill for almost 2 years now, and grill about 4 to 6 times a week and like to grill year round. I bought it simply because it was considerably less than others. I have never had the flair up problems others have had. I have had no problem cooking what ever I have wanted to cook on it(steaks, chops, chicken). Never tried low temp. cooking.The main complaint I have is, it hasn't lasted the time I would have liked. The grate has rusted beyond use and no drip tray or igniter.Also the unit came with no instructions for assembly, being a guy they are usually the last things we look at, but nice to have.It's not a grill that can handle wind, it won't last a long time, and there are no replacement placement parts that you can get, and from what I have been told customer service is less than satisfactory.I am currently looking for something more reliable and long lasting to replace it with."
4,Padded Keyboard Bench,A nice bench to be used with a keyboard; standard height. I have an 11-year old grandson who enjoyed receiving this bench for Christmas.
5,Very Happy,Needed this so bad! Super for the price... actually play classical guitar and that's the main thing I use it for. Back doesn't hurt anymore. Hooray for great seating!
3,Bench for Keyboard,It does the job but a little pricy for the quality. It is designed for Kids so keep that in mind :).
2,Damaged when received,"I am returning this item. When I received it, one of the bottom legs was bent so it will not sit straight (it rocks back and forth) so I am returning it and buying something different. It looked like it would have been a nice bench so I gave it two stars but I was very disappointed when I got it and it was already damaged. The packaging looked fine so it must have been bent when they packaged it..."
5,"A Good-Quality, Well-Built & Comfortable Professional Musician's Stool","We bought this for our son, who has over the past several months built his own recording studio in his room. This professional leather-padded chair was to replace the family foot stool, so our expectations were not high, especially given the plethora of higher-priced chairs out there.With Amazon Prime, the chair arrived free in two days! Expecting some assembly, we were delighted to find the chair fully assembled. My son simply opened the box, joyfully set up the stool, and within moments he was playing his guitar.As nearly as I can tell, this is the best low-cost portable musician's bench available. We highly recommend it."
4,Good for the price,My daughter is 7 and is the shortest person in her 2nd grade class. This bench was tall enough and words perfectly for our needs.
5,Great inexpensive keyboard bench,"We bought this piano bench for my daughter so she would be more comfortable sitting in front of her keyboard. She is completely happy with this bench. The padding is reasonably and I find it comfortable. It is snap to put up and ready, taking less than one minute. It is relatively good quality for the price. If you do not want to pay a fortune, you cannot go wrong with this under $30 bench."
3,"Fine for shorter periods, no good for longer hours of playing","The build is fine, the look is fine, but the cushion, the whole reason it is not just a wooden bench, leaves a bit to be desired.The cushion is cheap. It is comfortable for about an hour, and then quickly becomes uncomfortable.I'd be willing to pay another $30 for a bench with memory foam, but I've not seen such a thing."
1,Defective,"The seat when assembled rocked back and forth - seems like poor quality, I guess you what you pay for - I returned mine."
4,Solid little bench,"I was a bit concerned after reading someone else's review concerning poor workmanship. I don't see anything of the sort with mine. It's solid, comfortable and worth the price."
4,good quality,"the bench is comfortable, easy to set up from a flat folded position. It also feels sturdy. It ships for free, which brings it down to the same price as a cheaper model that did not look as solid to me."
5,Comfortable keyboard bench,"This was a gift for my husband, he is very happy with the bench. It works so much better than a chair."
4,"Great sit, not high enough","The seat is very comfortable, but the height limitation hurts our use of it a little. Very easy to put together and use."
5,Great Buy,The cushion is durable and unlike a lot of cushioned chairs it doesn't fall flat after one seating. It's a great choice for those of us wanting to play in the comfort of our homes and rooms.
5,Have a seat,What a perfect companion to my grand daughters keyboard! As I look at it it appears to be constructed very well
1,Lack of packaging damaged the box and item.,There was no internal foam or packaging. The bench tore through the box during shipment and was damaged. Returned the item.
2,A Hero All His Life: A Memoir by the Mantle Family,"Very disappointed in condition of book. It was not advertised as used; had folded corners on pages; had blue highlighting on half of one page. These ""used"" features were not at all indicated in the listing of this book for sale. I would not purchase ANY book again from this source."
2,A good idea that has no staying power,"I read the first chapter online and decided I had to have this book. Upon reading the second chapter, I started wondering what I'd ever seen in the first one. While the book starts off strong, it immediately loses all its charm and is too full of its own cleverness to actually be funny. This reminds me of what Mad Magazine was like after they ""Jumped The Shark"" by losing Dean Martin and Dick DeBartolo.Near the end of the book I got a little more interested in the characters, as sort of a vicarious Harry Potter book. This is kind of a tongue-in-cheek ""What If?"" rather than an actual parody.I applaud the author for getting this published and also for trying to make an original story, rather than just a rehashing of the first four books, but ultimately this book is just not funny. It tries to be in the same league as Bored Of The Rings and Doon, but fails."
1,NOT FOR KIDS!!!,"WARNING--THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR KIDS!!! My 4th grader brought this home from the school library. We both love the Harry Potter series so he enthusiastically showed it to me thinking we'd both enjoy it. I quickly looked at the back cover and thought I'd better ""preview"" the book before he read it. GLAD I DID. Drugs, sex, profanity, etc. McGonagall is now McGoogle and is Bumblemore's sex slave. Absolutely not suitable for elementary school students. And from my adult point of view--stupid and boring. It's been removed from the school library."
2,lowsy book,"This book is a lowsy parody. I've read my share of parodies, and I have to say this is the most pathetic. This book is more crude than clever, and has really bad jokes. Its not ment for children. But I was embaressed for it because of its overly sappy ending. Honestly, I think this book was more a fan fiction than a parody, and the author should be very, VERY embaressed. The only reason I gave this even two stars was because it did make me laugh a little before the author got too into it. Poor guy, he just loves harry too."
3,I guess they should have upped the ante,"I was moderately disappointed in Barry Trotter. While the premise is promising, the joke level sunk to groaning and not really an equivalent to ""Hey, that make sense now that they're making fun of the Harry Potter books."" Some little twists are quite clever, my sympathies to Lon. I still believe it is clever, riding on the coattails of a very popular series. It is good to know that even in the world of merchandising, one does have the opportunity to thumb a nose or two at it."
1,Don't bother,"There's a good reason Mad magazine and similar publications have pictures: Because pure narrative can carry such base humor for only so long. ""Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody"" is undebatable proof of that.An attempted parody of J.K. Rowling's best-selling Harry Potter series, ""Barry Trotter"" is at best a poor attempt at humor. Filled with 174 pages of fingers being randomly shoved up noses and endless bathroom jokes, it is entirely devoid of cleverness, a key element -- strike that: THE key element -- of good parody.(The word sophomoric comes to mind, but then that seems to be a little generous. Perhaps ""excretory"" is more fitting. It certainly is in keeping with the theme of the book.)If you're tempted to pick up this book for your children out of a misguided attempt at coaxing them to read, resist. Instead, have them look up dirty words in the dictionary. That way, they might actually learn something worthwhile."
1,"Sick, raunchy,...kinda wiered","To the author: Yes, I like Harry Potter to, but I dont go making fun of it...This is basically an issue of MAD magazine in a more book form. From what I have seen, the author pretty much stole most of his ideas from an issue I have once seen of that magazine. This guy is sick.... and, yes, he claims he did keep in mind that kids would also read this piece of ""art"", but fails to keep perverted jokes out of it. I'd be pretty [angry] if I were J.K. Rowling.... I mean, why would a fan of her work want to make fun of it? Another note: the price on this book is ridiculois, 10 bucks for a soft cover book? And yes, I HAVE read this, so I know what im talking about...."
1,Yuck!,I LOVE HARRY POTTER!I'm obbsessed with Harry Potter. I don't make fun of it. I read the first chapter of Barry Trotter and said i'm done. STOP MAKING FUN OF THINGS!Barry is in 11th grade???!!!!?? He smokes pot?????????????!!!!!!!!!!!! Are you crazy? What kind of example are you setting?
1,cheater!!!,"This is a complete waste of time. If you like Harry Potter, well this guy just took all J.K rowlings Stuff and teaked it!!! It is horrible!!!"
1,Absolutely Horrible!!!!,If I could I would give this book 0 stars. It was awful. This is taking making fun of Harry Potter to an all time low. This book disgusted me and I would NEVER EVER recommend it to ANYONE!
1,A terrible book,I can't believe someone would copy such a great author. Personally I think he just wants money. I am a big Harry Potter fan but I'm not copying someone. Plus he only changed the first two letters of his name.
4,Hiliarious Parody of HP,"This book was a quick read and a great choice if you were waiting for the next real HP book to be released. I agree with other reviewers that the jokes will be over your head if you haven't read the series. Also I would suggest that you only bother reading the parody if (1) you genuinely enjoyed the HP books, and (2) you will not take offense at the crass jokes that pretty much make up the parody. As another reviewer said, the book is not out to undermine the HP series, but just pokes fun at it's cultish popularity."
5,Funny. Didn't see it coming.,I was sceptical when I first heard of it but I loved the first chapter that I read online so I had to get it and I don't regret it! I found all the gags with Ferd and jorge's sweets very amusing.
5,"Very, Very funny stuff!",This is a MUST read for any fan of Harry Potter! Infectously funny and witty. Sure to be a collectors item. My hats off to Mr. Gerber.
4,Muggles Delight: a very funny parody!,"A parody of Harry Potter. It places him (and Hogwart's) in the real world: with dirt, subways, groupies, and venal, lawsuit-happy corporations. Hewing fairly closely to the original Harry Potter plot structure, the author recolors every story element in a hilariously twisted way and pokes fun at some of the unspoken assumptions behind children's literature.""Barry Trotter""'s seemingly encyclopediac knowledge of the Potterian world will delight Harry's fans (at least those whose skins aren't TOO thin.) At the same time, there is a great deal here for the uninitiated. The corruption in Barry's world is all too familiar to us ordinary muggles. This is a treat for all.Besides, that brat NEEDS a good swirlie.Funny and a pleasure for anyone who likes to read English."
1,Buy Bored of the Rings Instead,"I enjoyed the Bored of the Rings parody and was looking forward to reading this parody of the Harry Potter books. Unfortunately I didn't find it to be either witty or humorous. The puns are not particularly good and the storyline is amazingly unentertaining. It plods along with only the renaming of familar places and names to keep the reader mildly interested until it finally limps to a merciful conclusion. If you feel you must read this book, chip in with 20 or so friends to share it, then the expense might be worth it."
2,Not as funny as you might think,"I've read quite a few paradoy books over the last few years, and I hate to tell you, but this book isnt even half as good as you might expect.The first chapter shows promise, but from there onwards it just goes downhill. While some of the jokes are quite funny, most just fall flat -proving that there really is no joke funny enough to last more than 20 pages.If you're bored and looking for a book to read while waiting for the next Harry Potter to come out, or you're looking for a bit of ""toliet humour"" get this book. But get it from your local library, because this book just isnt worth buying."
4,Funny Book,"In this book, Barry Trotter, Lon Measley, and Ermine Cringer try to stop a movie about Barry from being made. The plot twists more than a rollercoaster, but it's still easy to follow. Also the writing style is creative. It's not a fantastic read that will make you cry with laughter, but it's good to occupy yourself with for a couple of hours. Good book"
4,Worth a look,"I have read all 5 Harry Potter Books, and although I did find them entertaining, I was soreley diassapointed with the hype and comparrison to Lord of the Rings (Excellent piece of liturature). This book was a surprisingly good read. Some of the humor was ""killed"", but overall its references to corporate propaganda and the like were refreshing. I realise that this book is inappropriate for younger (9 & younger) Harry Potter fans, but none the less it should be enjoyed by most. A word to remeber read all the fine print ect. to get the most out of this book, and don't take it two seriously, it doesn't!"
5,Absolutely amazing,"This book is simply amazing. Barbara Tropp knew China and Chinese cuisine as few westerners, especially at that time. The book is not for the harried person with no time but Chinese cooking with all the cutting and dicing in preparation is not for the harried person. But if you want to learn, this book is for you. What Maida Heatter is to desserts, Barbara Tropp is to Chinese cooking."
5,IGNORE COVER. SUPER PLOTS AND CHARACTERS,"I read a great deal for work, so high quality visual materials are desert. This is a top quality drama series, and its only flaw is the box looks old and cheesy. Ignore the box. It is a wonderful escape and joy.I only logged on to see if more sessions, and will always get this series as soon as more come out.It was with a dash of sadness that I realized this is the first set on DVD in N. America.The first reviewer did a fine job as I skimmed his review.This is a spy drama that is addicting, touching, romantic in a way both genders should enjoy, fascinating and with quality stories that grab you. The actors and all involved should be praised for such a gift."
5,Engrossing British Contemporay Detective Series,"Really enjoyed this series and the realism of the characters. For those of you have may have a problem with various British dialects, the DVDs are Closed Captioned. The detective is grumpy, moody and suffering grief because of the loss of his family. This grief underscores his approach to solving extremely difficult convoluted crimes."
3,Too scholarly for the average reader,"I read this book when it first came out and it is very well researched, yet there are so many different characters in the book that the reader loses his or her way and it is very confusing. I would have enjoyed the book more if the author had stuck with two or three characters to tell the story. The average book lover will not finish this book but will set it aside after a few chapters. What a pity. Still, it is a worthwhile project."
4,good,"The book was in good condition just as described.The shipment took a little longer than I expected, but still in the range of claim."
5,AN OUTSTANDING NOVEL BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS,"This novel concerns Mary Musgrove who was the Creek wife of John Musgrove, an Indian Trader who had a trading post near the Savannah River when Oglethorpe brought the first settlers to Georgia in 1731. After Mary's husband was killed, she was eventually forced to abandon her home and people. The novel sets out the problems she encountered and follows her children (Mary's Blood) on the trail of tears westward and ends up with some of her decendants involved in the battle of Little Big Horn. This novel transports the reader into the person of Mary Musgrove and allows us to feel the pains endured by the natives of this country during a period of disgraceful acts committed by some of our forefathers in the name of patriotism."
5,One of my favorite books one worth reading more than once,Creek Mary's Blood informs the reader about the good and bad of the Cherokee life. The reader becomes part of Mary's family and feels their pain.This is a book I will read over and over.I recommend this book if you have any interest in Native American history. I wish it was recommened reading for high school students.
5,Rave Review,I orginally bought this book in 1988 and thought it a beautifully written book on not only bird watching but of a Washington that no longer exists due to modern highways and bustle. I recently purchased this book for a friend who is a bird watcher and has lived in DC. I hope he will like it as much as I do. Jenny Brake
3,Not Her Best; Not Her Worst,"The more I read of Annie Proulx, the more I am convinced that she is a gifted author of fiction who, unlike anyone else, probes with violent clarity the barely sane of this world. When she is very good, as in ""The Shipping News"" and ""Close Range,"" she transcends the rugged terrain of her stories and writes wildly, yet coherently, about the atmosphere of suffering and pain. However, at times, as in ""Accordion Crimes,"" she goes over the edge and overwhelms the reader with gratuitous gore, and in so doing, alienates her audience. ""That Old Ace in the Hole"" falls more into this latter category. It is unengaging and dissatisfying. Read ""The Shipping News;"" it is Proulx at her best."
3,PRETTY WEIRD AND SLOW READING,"THIS WAS A VERY DIFFERENT BOOK---I TRIED TO DESCRIBE IT TO MY WIFE---AND---THE BEST WAY THAT I COULD EXPLAIN IT WAS---LIKE---A ROLLER COASTER---NOT SO MUCH THE DIPS & PEAKS---BUT----THE AUTHOR WOULD, CONSTANTLY---TAKE US ONTHESE SIDE TRIPS FOR PAGES ON PAGES---THEN EVENTUALLY---BRING US BACK AND STARTTELLING THE MAIN STORY AGAIN. THAT WAS KINDA CRAZY. I LIKE THE BUFFALO AND COWPARTS---THANK YOU!!"
2,Stay Away,"I read the Shipping News which I really liked (The movie was terrible) and Close Range which was even better.This book was a loser for several reasons:1) It feels like several short stories strung together to try to make a novel.2) The charcters (especially the protagonist) are poorly developed.3)Charaters and situations are supposed to move the plot along. Here we have a number of characters and situations that contribute nothing to the development of the plot.4) It's preachy. I'm in complete agreement with her about the dangers of agribusiness but I don't need to be hit over the head with it. The CEO of Global Pork Rind reminds me of Mr. Burns from the Simpsons.5) She couldn't decide if she was writing a satire, a novel, or a polemic.I should have stayed away when I saw that the only favorable review they could find for the back cover was from People magazine."
5,Proulx at her subtle best,"Astonishing as it seems, this rambling tale by Annie, chock full of anecdotes and Texas scenery rates as her best in my book. If Texas is as laid back and whimsical as Proulx and Larry McMurtry paint it, then more power to the lone star state. Who says a novel needs a plot? This endearing tribute to old style Americana deserves our attention in an age dominated by headline grabbing catastrophes, ghoulish foolishness, and purposeless tragedy. Congratulations to Annie for daring to bring us back to simpler times that still exist in our hearts and our heartland."
2,"Slow, boring and mostly depressing","Feed lots, chicken farms and hog farms are the source of meat forthe modern America. Bob Dollar has a bad childhoodand actually finds a home among the back Texas panhandle people.He sort of backs into it. Trying to buy land for hog farmsfor a multinational company.The writing is very good if the action is mighty slow( and pretty much reported second hand).I've been telling people for years that they will call this era,the plastic layer: Bob's uncle is a second hand dealer and a plastic collector. The closest thing to an interesting character is Orlando, Bob's best friend, who has a taste for old B horror movies.It took me several weeks to finish this novel;I finally just gritted my teeth and read it!It is not Annie Proulx's best work by far."
2,wished for more,"This story is clumsy and confusing. The main theme of the story about Bob Dollar and his job to find land for a hog farm in the panhandle should have been interesting, but it was not. There were far too many characters introduced in the book who really had no place in the story. The book failed to tell a coherent story about the geography and history of the panhandle. Some of the writing was quite beautiful, I wished I could have understoond it better."
3,Not On Par With Annie's Prior Work- -But Still Not Bad,"As a fan of Annie Proulx's prior works (especially Wyoming Stories!) I have become accustomed to superbly writtten, rich stories. Here, the writing is pretty good, but not on par with Annie's prior works. The story on the other hand is, at best, a quirky but somewhat entertaining yarn. So while true fans will probably enjoy this book, don't expect anything approaching the quality of Proulx's prior works."
4,And i thought I had a dumb job,"I found reading this book difficult; many times I had to begin a paragraph again, but I absolutely honor and revere Annie Proulx as a writer. Now that I've finished it I want to join an 'Ace in the Hole' club because I think reading this book through somehow separates the men from the boys. An accomplishment! She's done a marvelous job of describing an area and people and a culture but I don't find myself caring much about the people and Bob Dollar seems one of the least interesting characters I've ever met, although very real. I love The Shipping News, and I'll keep reading all her books because of that one. I threw Postcards across the room after the final brain aneurysm (I picked it up and finished it however!). Annie Proulx is a wonderful treat for her brilliant use of the language, whatever she writes."
4,Shades of John Irving,"I'm a die-hard fan of Annie Proulx's writing, and this is no exception, but I kept being reminded of John Irving's work here -- both in characters and structure. But then, I'm an Irving fan too, so no hardship there! The evocation of a place and its people is as sharp as ever and I always finish reading her with a yen to visit and see for myself."
2,Elgar masterpieces in rushed performances,"Hurst's recording of the First Elgar Symphony is one of the glories of the Naxos catalog-warmly expressive, full-bodied and glorious. His Enigma, though, seems rushed and in a hurry. There seems to be no feeling of noblimente which is such a part of Elgar's style. The same goes for ""In the South""-there is a tendency again to play too fast and there is something lost in atmosphere. The sound quality, though is good, although, some detail is lost. The orchestra is very good."
2,Cd still usable,"Cd arrived on time, but case was smashed in. Cd was not damaged save for a minor scratch."
2,Even an incredible all-star line up can't help this album...,"Man! Jack Dangers, Chuck D, Vernon Reid, Dave Lombardo... An incredible group of talent. However, the majority of the album loses steam with the contrasting energies of the individual parts creating a fractured and meandering whole. Credit must definitely be given to Dave Lombardo for excellent drum work, Chuck D for being Chuck D, and to Jack Dangers for the Bass and Guitar(!?) work on several of the songs. This album is a great gesture, but seems to be more of a novelty album than a repeat player. I like DJ Spooky's older illbient material, but I still feel that he is an excellent DJ, but a hit or miss producer.Ultimately, it's the kind of amazing lineup album that I'm dying to get a hold of, but now am a bit disappointed now that I've got it in my hands...Similar or related (and much better than this album):PraxisMaterialFantomasMeat Beat ManifestoPublic Enemy"
3,Bad,Just as simple as that. I own just about everything that Spooky has put out and I own many things that Thirsty Ear has released and this has got to be the worse release to date. Not that the idea or the combination between these musicians was a bad idea but the idea just didn't get realized with this recording. Songs seem like a bunch of pieces just slapped together and not well thought out constructions.I just hope no one buys this album as their first experience to DJ Spooky.
1,Jack Of All Trades Master Of NONE,"DJ, Producer, Musician, Writer, artist, and Filmmaker(ha) is often called a Renaissance man. Well Mr. Spooky just because you own final cut pro doesn't make you a filmmaker and just because you own protools does not make you a musician. This is the worst of Spooky's many failures! Time to pick a career and devout your life to it instead of all this haphazard look I do everything just not very well nonsense. If you want to be a musician, be a musician. You can still do those other things, They're called hobbies."
1,THERE IS NO SUCH BOOK....,"The reason this book is listed as unavailable is because I never wrote it. In other words, there is NO BOOK of mine called SHADOWS. My publisher and I have made numerous requests to have this listing omitted from Amazon and, as you can see, have failed. So, I apologize if any of you have wasted any time either ordering this book or waiting for it to be published--as of now, it has yet to be written.Lorenzo CarcaterraPS--I gave it one star because I couldn't submit a review without a rating."
3,Underwhelmed,Well written but a bit out of date. Scientific data often ages like egg salad on a warm day.
4,FOR THE HOBBYIST...,Very good information in this book... was a nice edition to my collection. Pictures and explanations are good.
2,Gems & Precious Stones,"I was really looking forward to getting this book. Any purchases I have made from Amazon.com in the past have been exactly what I was expecting. This purchase was a little disappointing for me. It was described as like new...can hardly tell it was used. Well....I would not have described it like that. Yes, it is in good condition except that the pages were bent as if it were read a lot. I guess I should be happy since it was really a low price. Will I buy again? Of course..just not from this seller."
4,worth reading!,I am a creative writing teacher and I found this book very helpful for my students. Good sections on Paragraph writing skills.
2,What were they thinking?,"I am pretty open-minded to movies...independents, low budgets, etc., but I found this to be very boring. I imagine some of the critical hype surronding this film is due to the ""state of the art"" computer graphics that were probably impressive back in 1991 when the film was made. The narrator's voice was annoying, to begin with, and the whole thing was shot on video (which, sorry, DOESN'T add to the storyline just because of the television aspect). If you have pretentious tastes (i.e., you read poetry at coffee shops), this might be the ticket but I was very disappointed, especially after reading all the glowing reviews by critics. I give it two stars, only because they ALMOST reached the deceptive heights of The Blair Witch Project in camouflaging the low-budget as high art."
2,Martin can do better,"First, let me say Kat Martin is a favorite author of mine. Second, let me say ""Kat, you have gotten better with time."" You can definitely tell this is an 'older' Martin book. And though I was torn with the rating - between 2 & 3 I went with 2. And though it might be better than a 2, it is DEFINITELY not a 5 or even a 4. Martin definitely has better out there! I have to agree with the other reviewer talking about the slave/non-slave and marriage/non-marriage issues. And Nicki's constantly planning to run away was so silly- that got old, too. The whole thing got old. I did finish the book and it's not a bad book, just boring. It is actually a good story and being a Louisianian myself (not cajun or creole) I was excited about the theme. I did a lot of page glancing to get through it. So if you like mild romance reading then this would be a good one for you."
1,sooooo bad,Alex is a jerk. He even admits to keeping her against her will... she is mistreated throughout the whole story and than agrees to marriage... - I don't think so!
3,"Um, all these reviews are for the wrong book!","Have you noticed something strange here? All the previous reviews on this page are for another book and another author, just the same title. This review is for Sweet Valley Twins #17, ""Boys Against Girls"". I hope that clears up some confusion. I Really liked this book when I was in the age group; it played out a lot of frustrations I had with my brothers! The twin's class has a new teacher who always taught boys before. He makes some unwelcome changes and the girls go on the warpath to prove they are just as good as the boys.By the way, is there a place where I can review the reviews?"
5,The girls a mad!,when lizzy and jess's class gets a new BOY teacher every one is thrilled. but the girls start getting treated worse then the boys. and the worse the girls get treated the more the boys act worse! you should read this!
5,Great buy!,"I just spent 20 gallons of stain on my deck which took me about 4HRS in 90-plus degree heat. This sprayer DID NOT miss a beat! Spraying, from ease to finish quality, is truly outstanding in every way! The adjustable nozzle is sensitive yet far from too sensitive and it's very easy to get the exact pattern you desire. Everything about this product is TOP quality. I HIGHLY recommend this product as it's by FAR the very best sprayer I've EVER owned. Chapin is the ONLY sprayers I will buy from now on. Very happy customer! An EASY five stars. Amazon as usual were outstanding!"
2,doesnt work for stain,"This product absolutely is not meant for stain. regardless of what it says, it does not ""spray"" stain on the deck like you would expect it to do. It basicaly comes out in a staight line, and made doing the deck much more work that i thought it would be when i purchased this product. Wouldnt recommend it."
4,"Good general book, useful to anthropologists and psychologis","Peter Worsley's book will be useful to anyone interested in the anthropology of traditional knowledge. It is a good general introduction to the area--heavily based, however, on British social anthropology, with minimal references to the American cognitive and ethnobiological schools or to psychology. Gene Anderson, UC Riverside"
3,Decent mailbox,"This mailbox is okay. Mine is mounted to a fence at the sidewalk, so it isn't protected at all from the elements. I live in a very rainy climate, and this product doesn't hold up fantastically in the rain - the lock gets a bit sticky, and the metal lid begins to peel - but it serves its purpose. In a rainy climate, you can expect to replace this mailbox every 5 years or so."
2,UMMMMMMM........NO,"Ok 5 stars for acting, Adrian is great in the role as a psychotic boyfriend, in fact the entire cast is great. The story itself is just boring, boring and slow. Rent it don't buy it."
2,Same Old Story,"I guess I'm on the minority side here. It was okay but we've all seen this one so many times.Girl meets boy...boy is such a charm in the beginning...boy changes as time goes and turns out to be overbearing, controlling, and high tempered...boy apologizes and wants to reconcile...boy doesn't change...girl wants out...and boy doesn't take it very well...You get the picture?There's more, but similar movies include:Sleeping With the EnemyEnoughFearBTW...Did anyone else think that Leila Arcieri looks alot like Vanessa Williams?"
2,Well...,"As far as getting the movie here fast and in one piece they did awesome. The movie however, was lame. I give the movie a 1 star if that."
1,Miserable Product,"First of all, this stuff didn't help me sleep at all that I could tell. It was basically like taking nothing. But, I figured I shelled out a lot of money for the pills so I kept taking them on the chance that maybe they did help a little. However, after a couple of weeks I noticed that I'd been feeling unuasually irritable and depressed. I figured maybe it was depression or maybe even a touch of midlife crisis. But why did it just hit me so hard and so quickly? So I started thinking about what had changed in my life over the last couple of weeks. All my worries were the same worries I'd had before. And then it occurred to me that I'd started taking the Sleep MD. I immediately stopped taking it and within two days started feeling much better. Coincidence? I doubt it. After all, the stuff is designed to drag you down in one way or another.Do yourself a favor and save your money. It's not worth it. Take a melatonin instead. It's a lot cheaper and probably just as effective."
5,Perfect for beginner or experienced user,"This is a great book whether you're a beginning user or you've been around the block a few times with the program. It is very clearly organized around the various program functions which, makes it great for reading straight through or picking out the functions as you need them. I borrowed the book for options on cropping and removing backgrounds and wound-up purchasing my own copy for its versatility and ease of use. It comes with an accompanying CD that has demo versions of some useful programs, as well as sample artwork and a full copy of the book you can search through on your computer. This book is superior to the ""Teach Yourself Visually"" series also from Maran, which tends to really hold your hand through the most basic functions. It is also much clearer than the text-oriented books which have more words than examples. A nice balance overall that all but the most advanced users will appreciate."
5,Wonderful books for beginners,I have purchased several 'Master Visually' books. They are the best at guiding you through complicated material.
2,"A good attempt, but finally unsatisfying, in my opinion.","The author, while obviously doing her best to exorcise the demons of her past in this book, is not, finally, a writer. I found the dialogue, in particular, stilted and not very believeable. I also could not help being suspicious about all the detail of the sexual abuse by her father--it seemed rather lurid and unnecessary, and I couldn't help suspecting that its main purpose might have been to get readers rather than to convey a feeling sense of the pain the author endured. I have been more moved by many books that are much more restrained."
2,disappointed,I bought the hHouston Junior League Stop and Smell the Rosemary and loved it. The book I just ordered is nothing like that. Stock up on a can of lard and other basics id you plan on using the Houston Junior League cookbook.
5,Great Book,Makes you rethink everything you've been taught. Fascinating theory that makes better sense to me than anything I've read befre on the subject.
2,Path of the Pole by Charles Hapgood....from Amazon.com,"This book contains some interesting data for a neophyte; however, most is outdated data. Plate Tectonics and magnetic effects have come a long way since this book was written."
5,Their Final Album- And Their Finest,"This album was the ""classic"" Angels lineup's final release.Although these men were in their late 40's when they made this album, you'd never know it. This album is a vicious onslaught of guitar-driven power.These tunes would stand against, and in many cases, SURPASS, the best of this Band's storied output. Cuts like ""What the Hell"", ""Caught in the Night"", ""Invisible Man"", and ""Wasteland"" show that this was anything but a band gasping across the finish line. This album Stunned me when a friend sent it up from Australia. Doc Neeson is in awesome form on this album,and the Brewster Brothers deliver their usual wall-of-noise onslaught.Brent Eccles and Jim Hilbun provide rock-steady rhythm.Better production would have helped a bit, but it's still a Guitar-fest from end to end.This is my favorite Angels album. Who'da thunk it?Now that the Brewster/Neeson/Brewster triumvirate has reunited, maybe we'll get a new album!"
2,Nothing New,"If you are of a scientific ""bent"" I would not reccomend this book. I learned very little that I hadn't already picked up by other sources."
3,Relaxing & Soothing,This album starts out with a classical number and then goes into a modern new age mode. The birds and ocean waves are relaxing. If you fall asleep while listening the last song on the album will wake you up. Very eclectic mood music. Although it is not one of Mannheims or Chip Davis' best album it is a good album to get a massage by.
3,Not Very Interesting,"I bought this for relaxing, not strictly massage, but I was still disappointed. I remembered Mannheim from years ago and their early Christmas albums as having more of a Renaissance sound combined with the ""spaciness."" There was none of that here: just soft jazz, spaciness, and nature sounds, adding up to not much. I prefer something more lyrical, I guess, so this is just personal preference. Anyway, it was so bland I wished I'd spent the money on something more by Dean Evenson (of ""Soundings of the Planet"") or waited until the re-release of Kitaro's ""Silk Road"" I and II. For as often as I'm likely to play it, I think I'll give it to a friend. And next time, I'll listen first at Borders!"
3,Buy yourself a good used copy,"I probably bought this CD because I'd heard #10 Creatures of Levania and #15 Chakra 4- they're the most complex and interesting pieces on the whole soundtrack. Only 2 other selections seemed noteworthy to me, #9 Crystal, sort of a spooky Twilight Zone tune (didn't like it) and #16 Morning. I found most of the selections to be repetitious with a lot of piano to them- they weren't ""bad"", just more of a restful ""background music"" sort of thing.You'll want a good sound system to really get the effect of Mannheim's efforts, for me if I were doing it over- I'd buy a good used copy & save some money."
2,"fascinating subject, but only a so-so book","I have to admit to not finishing this book. The history of the Basque people is a fascinating tale, but this book was a dreadful slog. The writing style was too loose and chatty resulting in a narrative which was more of a jumble of anecdotes than a cohesive history. There is altogether too much space devoted to the Franco/WWII years. I did like the recipes and the food commentary. Historians often forget that food is an integral part of a national identity.Perhaps this book improved at the end. However, as mentioned previously, I couldn't get through it."
4,Finally....a tribute to Euskadi,"I have a Basque maiden name (Echazabal, or ""big house"" in the Basque language) and I loved this affectionate history of the traditions and tenacity of the Basque. Their unfailing courage and their ingenuity are amazing. Kurlansky obviously loves the Basque and their ancient culture and, if you don't mind a few recipes mixed in with your history lessons, this is a very entertaining book. My only complaint is that the complex history of the ETA is given short shrift in the latter chapters. I would have loved more on the people in the ETA, more on the unique Basque language and even a few more recipes. This is a fun book that could have been longer."
1,"Not a history book, and highly biased","I read The Basque History of the World about one year ago. I had been asked a few times about Spanish history, and found myself quite ashamed not to know more. So I decided to grab a couple of books.My boyfriend and I read it together by night, and although it is quite catchy, and easy to read because of Kurlansky's love for Basque culture, it is amazingly biased. Kurlansky is definitely not a historian, and although it never claims to be history, I wonder what to think about someone who does not give any of his sources.The book is at the same time quite confusing. I knew the story -not the details or dates-, but my boyfriend got lost frequently.If what you want is an easy-reading, then this may be your book. Kurlansky is higly partial, and his history of events is rather incomplete, so in my opinion, it should never be used as a reference."
4,Very Interesting and Informative Reading,"I bought this book based on the quality of Mark Kurlansky's other works. As with his other books, Mark does a very thorough and effective job of bringing to light much little known information about a somewhat obscure topic, and actually makes it interesting to read. While this book is slightly difficult to read due to the abundance of Basque words, I still enjoyed it immensely and feel that it is worth the effort. The Basque truly are a unique and noble people with many things to teach the rest of the world. A nation within a nation, Basqueland is separated from its neighbors not by geographical or political boundaries, but by cultural boundaries, which is most likely the biggest reason why the improbable Basque nation is still in existence today."
1,This was not written to inform you.,"Neither was this written to entertain you.Nor to intrigue you.This book was written to impress upon you that Mark Kurlansky is SO EXCELLENT, that even the super-secretive BASQUES talk to him.Oh, my.This book is a collection of anecdotes and some recipes, and a couple hundred pages of unreadable far-left fascism vs. far-left communism vs. Vichy France-ism vs. Nazis. And the Basques. Love big-terrorism? Go Basques! Big deal.I had read a semi-interesting novel by Katherine Neville called ""The Fire"" which indulged in quite a bit of Basque hearth-worshipping backstory. I thought this book would be interesting, too. I was wrong."
4,Very good overview of the Basque history,"In this book, Mark Kurlansky narrates the history of this charming place in Europe as seen from the Basques. In my opinion, he's managed to capture accurately the way Basques think about themselves, and the relations they entertain with their French and Spanish neighbors. 'The Basque History of the World' is well written, and manages to give the reader a concise overview while avoiding caricature.I also loved the idea of interspersing recipes (food is a pilar of basque culture) in the text."
2,Biased,"Biased and self centered as it gets. Again, a foreign party sees the ""romaticism"" of basque nationalism , ignoring the 858 victims ETA has killed.Identifying ""basque"" with nationalist is denying the history of the basque. Nationalism in the basque country only appeared in the 19th century, heavily influenced by catalonian nationalism. To say that the basque have been opressed throughout history is a lie.But it s very pintoresque to portray them as some sort of heroes ... the ffod is good, the sights are beautiful, but we basques are ignoring the victims, and around 300.000 basques that left the country because of threats , extorsion , and murder on their relatives. Those of us , basque through and through, that do not get a vote there, because we we told to leave or face the consequences.I don t find any of that in the history by Mr. Kurlansky."
3,The Basque History of the World: The Story of a Nation,"This is a well written book but not in the same class with this author's other two works I have read: Cod and Salt. Having made that comment, if you are especially interested in a history of the Basque people, it is the best book I have found on this subject."
2,"Good book about food, bad book about history","I have to admit that the book reads well and the author enriches the descriptions with his personal experiences. However, this is what the book is, a book written based on the experiences and feelings of one person. It is just plain wrong to classify this books in the history section, and so the title is misleading.The author has taken a one sided, romantic, not sufficiently researched account of incomplete historical events to write an entertaining book that lacks rigour and steps into historical fiction (e.g. the theory that Basques must have discovered America before everyone else but told nobody).My recommendation: if interested about food read ""cod"" from the same author, but skip this one."
5,A colourful read,"I have always been interested in the Basques, since studying the Spanish Civil War in high school. I received this book as a present and have read it twice in five months. Since then I have investigated Basque culture on the internet and am interested in living there for awhile and learning the language. Kurlansky spins a great story, and there is plenty here to tell. The Basques, like the Welsh, have been a minority within a larger and more powerful nation-state for centuries, and have been subjected to numerous attempts at assimilation. But nonetheless they have survived against all odds, and have prospered. For those whose sympathies lie with the small nations, this story is one of hope. Read this book! A footnote to this is that I was able to recognize the Basque names on a few of the soccer players in Euro 2000 (and saw an ikurrina in the stands). I have a feeling a Basque team would be very competitive."
2,A Basque History Of The World,"I found the book to be a terrible disappointment. It turned out to be more of a polical manifesto than a serious, documented book on the history and culture of the Basque people and their wonderful country. I found it to be very superficial and extremely biased on its discussion of the historical relationship of the Basques with the rest of the Spanish peoples, past and present. I can only think of two redeeming qualities. It contains a wonderful collection of traditional Basque cooking recipies and it is one of the very few books written in English that one is likely to come across. Read it but keep an open mind."
2,"how romantic, how misleading","as a Baque, I became emotioned through parts of the book. How great to be the oldest culture in Europe, amazing that we fished whales in America.But the political tone of the book is profoundly misleading. The Basque Country is now one of the areas with more autonomy in Europe (own tax, police, education systems), while hundreds of Basque non-nationalist politicians, businessman and journalists need the constant protection of bodyguards because dozens of them have been killed in the last years. And this, while the nationalists in power -who live confortably secure-, enjoy the cod, the alubias and probably Mr. Kurlansky's book.how romantic (if you don't happen to live there), how misleading"
4,"Reading in situ at the Guggenheim, Bilbao",This very readable book will greatly enhance a visit to the Guggenheim in Bilbao and touring in the surrounding area. The Basque region is geographically and culturally very different from the rest of Spain. Much of it's history is unknown to the ordinary traveller history buff. Kurlansky's book will be a pleasure to have along.
4,Approval from an American Immigrant,"Here is a book which I--an American with no Basque ancestry, who immigrated to the Basque Country 25 years ago--recommend to family and friends who want to understand the people whom I have become a part of. This is not a book for those of us who live in Basqueland, as Mr. Kurlansky calls it. Basques of all political hues will find bones to pick and hairs to split as none are portrayed in a totally favorable light (Note the vehement criticism of many readers of Basque extraction). Despite omissions and some erratas, ""A Basque History"" provides a perceptive glimpse of the Basques and the contrasts and tensions of life in our little corner of Europe. Attractively packaged popular history, this is the best work on the Basques I have come across in English."
3,Leaves You Hungry for More,"I found this book to be delicious fun to read. Anyone who has read much in Spanish history is left with an awareness of this enigmatic people who have left such a strong mark on Hispanic culture in so many ways. And yet, until now there has not been a popular history of the Basques to refer to.Unfortunately, I think that the definitive book on Basque culture is yet to be written. While I learned a great deal about the Basques' own folklore about themselves, a little about Basque cuisine, and a great deal more than I want to know about the separatist movement and the modern demographic shifts in the Basque area, I felt that I still didn't get a substantial picture of the Basques as people from this book. Perhaps Mr. Kurlansky wanted to write more (he obviously has warm feelings for his subject), but he felt that nobody would be willing to read a longer book on the subject. If so, I hope he will reconsider and give us more."
4,Preparing to visit the Basque country,"I bought this book in preparation for an upcoming trip to the Basque region of Spain and France. Turns out that I not only learned a lot about the Basque area and the history, but received a new and different historical perspective. The history of Spain is very interesting. As a bonus, one learns a lot about European and World history as well. I recommend the book to anyone either interested in history [especially European history] or anyone preparing to visit Spain."
1,not true,"most items listed in this book may have started in the US but are now only made in other country's. for someone trying to find things made in america, this book is no help. it is a sham"
1,this book is out dated,the book is old and out dated alot of things in this book are no longer made in usa alot of it
5,Outstanding,Extremely useful in both personal and professional life. I've attended many classes & seminars in the last 30 years but still learned a host of valuable info. Highly recommended.
3,Good content-very dry,The content is excellent but she narrated her own book and it's very dry to listen too. I recommend buying the book and working through that.
5,"Fantastic read, especially if you are introspective","This is one of those books that makes me want to read it over again just so that I can remember the details. I took it slow and read through and thought through how I could incorporate the ideas suggested in this book into my business and personal life.If you like to tailor your conversations, want them to be more fulfilling and want to have more fruitful and powerful conversations, this book is for you. The post-read introspection and revelations are delightful!"
1,Disappointment,"I'm not sure who's writing these reviews, but I read repitition after repitition after repitition, with a lot of confusing fluff. Asking hard questions to solve complex or simple issues. What's ""fierce"" about that?The writing style and content just didn't flow. Wasn't real. I mean, in one section, she actually uses the term ""bucko,"" as in, ""Let me tell you something, bucko."" What are we in ""Happy Days?"" Couldn't take the book seriously after that. Very bad."
2,Watered down old wine in a new bottle.,"There is nothing really new in this book than anything else I have read or experienced over the past 50 years. Honesty and forthrightness is always in vogue; if the place you work does not support honesty, change jobs. If people in your life do not value honesty, dump them. A person does not need to read this trivial repetetive book to know that."
2,"Boring, no help",Just a lot of the same ole stuff already written by others. Statements telling you to achieve something with no verbs as to how to do this.
5,Not a Lightweight Book,"Okay, I didn't buy this from amazon.com, a friend gave me my copy. But if you're reading in this venue, this is a great book. Why, cause it's not one of those books where the author took 20 pages and expanded it into 200. There are plenty of insights in this book by Ms. Scott. It's one of those book you'll want to read again."
2,"A Toss Up - Some Good, Some Bad","Love - hate thoughts on this book so I went middle or the road, 2.5 stars. Some parts were slow and dull so I found myself glossing over them. Other parts, like the Mineral Rights conversation and preparing for difficult conversations, were very good. Much of the advice is Carnegie like so I suggest you read How to Win Friends and Influence People. I would have preferred the fluff been removed and shorten the book considerably. All in all, it was worth my time because of what I do at work but it's certainly not for everyone, not a book I'll find myself recommending except in very specific circumstances. Even then I'd probably tell someone to get it at the library and just look at a few sections."
1,"Not as Helpful as ""Difficult Conversations.""","I listened to both this and ""Difficult Conversations."" I found that ""Diffiicult Conversations"" offered much more helpful, concrete advice, and the material was much better organized. I was disappointed that the emphasis of ""Firece Conversatons"" was almost entirely on business related conversations. Example after example focused on her executive clients. After listening to this program, I felt no more prepared for conversations with friends and family than before. There were a few helpful ideas, but they were presented much more clearly in ""Difficult Conversations."" ""Difficult Conversations"" gave me real, practical strategies that have made a big difference in my ease in bringing up tricky conversations and working through them with positive results."
5,Must Useful Book on Interpersonal Communication,"This book is a must-read for anyone who would like to improve the way that they communicate at work and at home. It provides the reader with tools to make the most of any conversation, and address issues and problems constructively.I used the 'Mineral Rights' guidelines to form the basis for a discussion with my manager about a problem that I'd been having, and that hour-long discussion was a tremendous step in getting it resolved. Afterward, he told me that he appreciated my honest and forthright approach to confronting the issue, and my inclusion of him in the process."
4,Excellent concept; a bit repetitive,"This book offers a great way to approach difficult conversations. There are several templates in the book to show the reader how to do this. However, after reading it, it does tend to repeat certain aspects of the material. I am sure that some of that is for effect; but for someone who is capable of applying material quickly it can be somewhat boring. I still recommend it as a read, but I do not recommend that you need to completely read the book to get the overall message."
1,Picture,"Mats sent was different from picture not worth the money,will not place a order with Coverking.Slow about returns,be careful you may not get what you pay for."
2,"For the utterly inexperienced, and no one else","Please be aware that if you have any musical or choral training at all, this book is NOT for you! It's completely aimed to the untrained musician who has been asked to volunteer to direct a church choral group.If you have choral music training it will be completely UN useful to you."
4,Some good ideas...,"This book gives a fresh look at the ministry of church music leadership. If you've been in the business for a few years, many of the ideas will not be all that new, but this is recommended for all church music directors. All of us need a little kick every once in a while, and this will help!"
5,The Wednesday Workout: Practical Techniques,This book was received in great shape and actually sooner than I expected.I know it will be really helpful in learning how to become a better choir director. Thank you for writing a down to earth book that is so easy to understand and with so many wonderful helps and hints. It is a great book.
3,what is missing,"i found it very disappointing to discover there were no subtitles for the hearing impaired. its difficult enough to catch the vagaries of cockney, seaside and lower class accents when you can hear perfectly but almost impossible with any actual hearing loss. for a series released so recently this seems a grevious oversight. the narration was clear enough with the volume raised to the point of disturbing the neighbors but ""David Copperfield"" did not have that advantage. i would not purchase this edition knowing that in advance."
4,"Catchy, melodic, and foreshadows later High Llamas glory","This is an unexpectedly pleasant recording, the first tentative steps toward what would later become the magnificent glory of the High Llamas. You could pretty much consider this their first CD, since Sean O'Hagan (the writer/arranger) is accompanied by musicians that all continued onto Santa Barbara, the first ""official"" High Llamas release. The song ""Perry Como"" is both catchy and amusing, and ""Doggie"" rocks out nicely. Also very good songs are ""Half Face Cat,"" ""Edge of the Sun"" and the oddly country-ish but smooth ""Pretty Boy."" If you simply buy this out of the blue without knowing who Sean O'Hagan is, you will probably like at least a few of the songs, but if you are really into the High Llamas, and know the beautiful artistic aesthetic that O'Hagan was just a few years from perfecting, then this CD will probably impress the hell out of you. It also sounds great through headphones!"
5,Quality beanie for a good price,"I wanted to buy a beanie to keep my head warm with the cold weather starting, so I turned to my favorite onilne store Amazon. I just wanted a cheap beanie, and fortunately, I found this one. The one I purchased was a ""Decky"" branded black beanie with visor, which was made in China, 100% acrylic. All things considered, this beanie was a good buy for only $3.25 (as of 11/16/11) - fits my big head, has a nice little visor, and is comfortable.FYI - you can get cheap beanies ($3-$6, different patterns and what not) at Walmart."
2,Poor Material,Had a big hole in the top of the hat with in 2 weeks. I do not recommend buying this. Save your money
3,Runs a bit small,"I like the style of the hat, but only wore it once because i had to keep pulling it down. The width is fine, but it needs more length."
3,"Cheap price, so poor material.","You get what you paid at its price. The material is not soft, cause itchy and look cheaply. It is knitted so thin."
5,A Bittersweet Space Opera and Trek at its Best,"This is one of my favorite original series episodes. It proves that even as the show was nearing cancellation, it still had lots of pizazz and power. While most Americans have probably seen this episode many times over the years, it is difficult not to be moved by it's premise: Impossible love, loss of immortality, and the failure of the mind to control the heart.The beautiful Android Rayna's untimely death due to Captain Kirk and Flint's boyish wrangling is bad enough- but the most poignant scene is at the end, when Spock mind-melds with Kirk to help him forget his foolishness; a sudden end of scene, and we see the Enterprise flying away.... Very moving. And of course, this episode has some very beautiful music, typicl of the original series score, with a gorgeous waltz made specially for this episode.I feel this episode encapsulates all that is Star Trek, The Original Series. It is a must have that still holds up today."
3,Could have been good,"This episode could have been good had it not been marred by a scene in which Kirk acts in a manner which is absurdly out-of-character, putting his own interests ahead of those of his crew by, in Kirk's own words, ""fighting over a woman.""The story is reminiscent both of ""Pygmalion"" and ""The Tempest,"" but with an interesting twist. Flint, the mentor/erstwhile lover of his creation, an android named Rayna, is an ageless being who once was Johannes Brahms as well as other famous humans. The episode also concludes with a remarkably compassionate scene."
4,The Second Coming,"I never liked this album as much as Nick's 80s albums that were more light-hearted and didn't try as hard. And let's face it -- the reason that Elvis is more relevant today is that at the time he was making music about something other than making music. It feels like half the songs here are about the pop music industry and none of those have the impact of Radio Radio. That said, this re-issue does rock out and has some pure pop gems."
3,Jesus of Cool is Luke warm.,"Despite its age ""Jesus of Cool"" has managed to keep it's originality intact. There are some killer songs and then there are the Luke warm fillers. All in all I'd buy it again.BZ"
5,The second coming,"Thank God for Nick Lowe. When music was flirting with garbage, Lowe swooped in and helped save it. Or something like that. One of Lowe's finest albums is stocked with classic tracks. Every track here still sounds as fresh and catchy as the day it was released in a decade where Afternoon Delight had become the artistic standard.From the off kilter and ultimately gross power pop classic Marie Provost to the stunning I Love The Sound of Breaking Glass, Lowe is possessed and possesses the goods to deliver on this stunning classic. Sadly, it appears that Jesus is out of stock but he will arise again.If you can't wait, the great boxed set The Doings contains much of this classic album as well as its follow up. Well worth every penny, Lowe set a new high for witty, well written rock'n'roll."
5,I liked Jesus before Jesus was cool,"I've had a promo copy of Pure Pop For Now People since it's original release. And an almost apostle like respect for old Nicky for just as long. This is an exceptional fine reissue of Lowe's finest work. And worth the price alone, (for me), to hear the original version of Cruel to be Kind. And all the other bonus songs too! He made rock smart and you didn't have to know it or really care. Because it's, plum fun."
5,Jesus of Cool,"There are five or six records that define ""new wave"" in the late 1970's and this is one of them. Nick Lowe is a genius and this record proves it. He wrote a pop classic about the Bay City Rollers, rocked hard with ""They called it RocK"" yet still had time to write classics such as ""So it Goes"" and ""I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass"". Remember, there would be no Elvis Costello with Nick, so if you like this period in rock, buy this CD. I guarantee you will not regret it."
4,Cell phone case,"Nice material, but design could have engulfed phone a little more.(Won't work with extended battery.)"
2,nowhere near the classics,"I saw some reviews putting this new CD in the level of the classics ""The Curse"" and ""Warning Of Danger"". No way!The songs here lack the urgency of those in Warning of Danger (""Ruby Eyes"", ""Red Horizon"") and the grandeur of those in The Curse (""Teeth Of The Hydra"", ""Destiny"", ""Holy Martyr""). The album looks like one big song and the vocals will bore you midway through.If you expect to hear classic Omen in this CD, you'll be disappointed. If you're a fan and want to have the band's entire catalog, it's a different story."
4,Lifts the spirits,"At first I wondered what I was listening to, having no preconceived ideas or knowledge of this cd but thought it looked interesting - and it certainly is.There is a wonderful simplicity and naivety within the lyrics which shares similarites with Songs from the Auvergne but focuses on apples, herbs and fish more so than shepherds and shepherd lasses. One can easily imagine the scenes portrayed and the humour and sentiments behind them.The more I listened the more I enjoyed.Steve, Oxford, UK"
2,Skampa Quartet is great - the singer... yikes,"I honestly did not know what I was getting myself into when I bought this CD. I love Janacek, I love folk songs... how could I go wrong? Iva Bittova! I was concerned that she would have a 50yr old woobly voice, but instead what exists is a thin VERY nasal tone... perhaps she should be singing traditional Bulgarian music! The voice is expressive, just ugly.The recording quality is not very good, either. On many of the tracks, Iva seems to be muffled and in the background of the recording.Really - dont waste your time and money, unless you really would just like to have a recording of over 50 Janacek songs."
3,sam waterson,okay movie that's best parts are seeing the much younger versions of the actors such as sam waterson.
4,A gem for any fan of the ROCK to discover...,"Mr.Erickson could pen a great tune, that's for sure. Lyrics, music-the whole package nothing short of compelling. Once I heard ""Cold Night for Alligators"", I was hooked. It's no wonder that great bands such as The Hellacopters and Entombed cover songs from the Erickson canon. If you're looking for impassioned rock and roll, you really can't beat this. Check out the tune ""Anthem""-an acoustic based number, the feeling and power Roky is channeling cannot be ignored. I envy those who saw these songs performed in the flesh, for many of these selections were derived from different live shows between the late 70's and early 80's. This would have received 5 stars, but in being live, the sound quality in some areas is lacking-but should by no means prevent it's purchase. The souls of true music lovers will feel nourished upon listening..."
5,The Best Geometry Book ever!,"This geometry book is the best geometry book of all time. It is well written and truly challenges students to understand geometry on a deep level. I wouldn't recommend the book for a lower level of students, but it is outstanding for everyone else. I love it and I am inspired by it. (I am a math teacher.)"
5,That New Animal,"We have an animal, and a new animal in our family, and the book portrays exactly what happened in our house. Made us laugh."
2,Disturbing details spoil what could have been a cute story,"My 3 year old son LOVES this book. The idea of the book is great, complete with kid-attention-grabbing ""peeing all over the floor"" however there are a number of details in this book which are kind of disturbing and not well-chosen. In one place the dogs discuss whether or not they should bite the new baby and in another place they consider the idea of burying (presumably alive) the baby in the backyard with the bones. Uh huh. There are two parts that will make anyone who has been affected by SIDS or who is just concerned about it VERY disturbed: In one picture the parents are depicted using an extremly unsafe sleeping environment-- both parents are asleep in their bed and the mom has the baby asleep on her stomach. In another part one of the dogs climbs into the cradle and is practically smothering the baby."
3,Puppy love,"Who said it's a dog's life? FudgeFudge and Marshmallow may be man's best friends, but life gets ruff when a new baby puts them in the doghouse faster than you can say, ""down, girl!"" But they're not going to roll over and play dead. They plot revenge, until Grandpa shows up and becomes a bone of contention.Hah! I'm so punny, I just kill myself. Hey, if there are books to get siblings used to the idea of having a new baby around, why not one for your mutts? Although Jenkins says she has no dogs of her own, her depictions of their distress and jealousy certainly have bite.Pratt stretches the figures to funny, whimsical sizes, and the fuzzy brushstrokes and bright colors add an upbeat touch even as the dogs go barking mad. This one'll tickle you down to your funny bone, and teach an older sibling that no, you can't bury your baby sister in the backyard.(Sorry about the puns. I just couldn't help myself. I'm through now.)"
5,Stunning!,I have had this ring for only a few days and let me just say that this picture is great but still doesn't do this ring any justice. It is absolutely stunning! This pave setting is a perfect mix of vintage mixed with a modern look. I adore this ring and am heavily considering buying another as I am hard on jewelry and don't ever want to be without it. I also have received many many compliments. Great value at a great cost :D
4,Highland Clans 101,A great book for those looking for their roots or trying to understand the basics of the Highland clans. The intro gives us a nice view of clan make ups and life in the highlands. The rest of the book is divided into individual clan histories. This book is great for the newbe or even as a nice addition to those who are collecting more info. Some of the pictures are unique and there are some great tidbits of info on the clans. I really enjoyed this book.
1,An answer to this book,"The book: ""Thirty Years as Jehovah's Slave"" gives an answer to the negative approach of this book. Jehovah's Witnesses are not ""evil"" people with evil intentions. They sincerely try to do what God requires of them. For an unbiased reading of their beliefs, this book by Jeffrey J. Neumann provides a refreshing and not ""preachy"" look into why Jehovah's Witnesses believe as they do. Well worth reading. Available from Amazon. Look under ""Thirty Years as Jehovah's (NOT WATCHTOWER) Slave""."
1,Apostates are oppresive wolves at the door.,"Actually I havent read this book nor do I need to.It is trash!I have ordered cds from Amazon but now I must refuse to order anymore since you sell apostate literature.I thought you were above this.The lies they spread about nonviolent God fearing people is the workings of their father the devil.They try to make a name for themselves,their books are ot inspired of God.They are brain washing people,all of the JW beliefs are straight from the scriptures.So if they go against the word of God they will soon see their demise.I have been a nonwitness and now I am a witness and I can tell you being a witness has made me happy and has given meaning to my life.I have a relationship with God without any doubts of his existence.What do these workers of lawlessness have,only a few moments left to spit out their poisonous venom and hope crushing lies.I hope amazon realizes that the truth is the truth and they will stop selling lies to children."
3,a look in the JW past,"Warning: William Schnell was not a great writer. His sentence structure, story telling skill and spelling leave a lot to be desired but in this book's case it's not that important. 30 Years is a shocking look into the JW past. It's a past that most modern JWs know nothing about. Schnell writes about how he got hooked into the sect and details his life in it. Being a JW in the early days of the religion meant blind obediance, poverty and constant knawing dread. Schnell's life was so totally wrapped up in the sect that he barely had time for a normal family. He doesn't mention his wife until the book is almost over and we never do learn what her name was.In the end Schnell seemed to find some comfort and happiness after walking away from 30 years of misery.If you want to find out what life is like for a JW this isn't the book for you. It is strictly (thank goodness) a historical artifact."
3,Great for any former J.W. or any one involved with them.,"I was born into the Jehovah's Witness CULT. This book, along with other sources. Helped me understand the truth about this religion and to be free from the brainwashing ingrained into me from a young age. It is a must read for any person who has been a ""Witness"" or is considering being absorbed in to there society."
4,Decent Novel Makes Fantastic Audio-Book,"Whatever clumsiness of prose might trip up a reader, disappears completely in John Lee's wonderful performance. A Lincolnshire dialect for Newton, and amusing characterizations of the wide-ranging cast of supporting eccentrics, made this audiobook a pure pleasure. I have a feeling I wouldn't have made it through the endless interrogations if I were reading this on my own, but with Lee's narration, I was sorry to hear it end. (Note: The digital version is abridged, and by a different narrator. I cannot vouch for that.)"
2,Disappointing,"After reading the description on the case I'd had high hopes for this, but was sorely disappointed. While I did slog through it, only because I was doing other things while listening, I was not impressed. The premise was interesting, but it was a bit coarsely presented and really, frankly boring at points. The only thing I did like were Newton and Ellis's religious theories.Newton's behavior in the book reminded me Sherlock Holmes a little too much, with Ellis as a faithful Watson.While I did not hate the book I was not impressed and cannot recommend it. The reader, John Lee, however, did a very good job with the reading, making what would have been intolerable better. His reading really set the tone for the book and brought it to life in its time period."
3,Average,"This historical mystery features Isaac Newton as a sort of late 17th century Sherlock Holmes. It centers on Newton's late career as director of the English Mint during the important recoinage of English currency. This book has a number of potentially attractive elements; an interesting historical central character, an interesting historical setting, and combined elements of mystery and international thriller. Kerr has done enough research to feature some good period details. His depiction of Newton, clearly drawing on Richard Westfall's fine biography, features Newton's interest in alchemy and his heretical religious opinions. By and large, however, this book has a relatively formulaic feeling. None of the elements are original and none are combined in a novel manner. The quality of plotting, character development, and prose in merely average."
4,"Fun, quick read","Love Kerr's Berlin Noir---this is much lighter, and quicker, but no less fun. Very much enjoyed it---so much better than Ghostwalk (another novel featuring Isaac Newton), which I did not get and have already forgotten its denoument, although I read it last week.Highly recommend."
1,Boring,"Interesting concept but poor execution. I read a lot of mysteries and other books as well, but I only made it through about 50 pages before I gave up. Fortunately, I checked it out of the library so all I wasted was my time. Boring, dull, stilted, boring, dull, stilted, boring, dull, stilted........."
3,Interesting...but had some shortcomings,"The book, Dark Matter: The Privet Life of Sir. Isaac Newton was a very interesting book. I read through the first 250 odd pages with excitement and enjoyment. However, once the book reached page 300, it felt like the author realized he had to finish it and then quickly tied up all the lose ends almost to neatly. My other main problem with the book is something, which I encounter with the vast majority of modern fiction, and that is sex. There seems to be this idea that a book must have at least one scene during which people must engage in the act, now I understand that on occasion this is important to the plot or the character development, however, must we actually be subjected to a detailed analysis of the actions preformed? This book would have been better, and the characters as well developed had we not been 'privileged' to their sexual activities. Still on the whole, it was an enjoyable book, with strong characters, and an interesting plot."
4,A thriller with a brain,"You don't often read a thriller or mystery novel that leaves you feeling like you've learned something as well as having been thoroughly entertained, but this is that book. Excellent."
5,Another superior recording for Graham Bonnet,"How anyone can maintain such an incredibly powerful voice over 40 years is absolutely incomprehensible. This is another notch for GB, as he once again performs admirably on this recording. Until this album, I was unfamiliar with Anthem. However, GB has always had a knack for attracting musical talent, making them sound better than they ever could otherwise, and this album does not disappoint. The musicianship here is stellar. Nobody keeps GB for more than an album of tunes. Graham moves on again and again, as he did from here, and yet he NEVER produces anything other than memorable vocal performances. Keep on rockin' ""Iron Lungs."""
1,Anthem Fan,"Anthem is meant to be heard with original singer Eizo Sakamoto, not a half talent. Complete waste of money."
1,Nothing to do with the band Deerhunter ...,"This is an import ""Deerhunter"" single from a UK band named Infrasound. I ordered this cd thinking it was from the American band named Deerhunter when I saw the ""Cryptograms"" cover artwork. There is no relation between the two bands as far as I know, and I just wanted to post this 'review' so other Deerhunter fans might be able to avoid the same mistake."
2,I'll Try Again,"Sometime in the future, I will try to read this book again. This is the first of Sue Grafton's alphabet books that I had a real struggle getting into so, I gave up. I loved all the other books in the series, but here Kinsey seems to be on ""autopilot."" I miss the feisty, funny Kinsey!"
1,"S is for ""Same Old Stuff""","Sue Grafton milked this cow dry a long time ago. I thought I would stop reading the Kinsey Milhone mysteries after getting to ""P"" because there was little originality left. However, I saw ""S"" and read it. Can I say I was disappointed? I guess not, since I expected the same old same old, and that's what she delivered in terms of plot, character and the rest. And Santa Barbara is a lovely place, surly, but it is ending up as dull as its endless foggy days in June."
2,Kinsey who?,"Like many of the other reviews, I was left wondering when Kinsey would be showing up.The story was good, but any detective could have been the title character. I missed everything about Kinsey's life that makes her unique.I'm going to read the next one - T is for . . . I hope it's about the character I've come to love."
2,style change?,it is taking me soooooo long to read this book! it's so boring and seems to be a style change in writing! I just cannot get into the story without falling asleep but I will finish tonite! I love the old Kinsey stories that are fast and capturing. I may go to the library for the T book before buying it. Sorry Sue! We like your old style.....
3,S is for So-So,"This is not the best in the series. It's a decent story, but the presentation was lackluster and a little disorienting at times, bouncing back and forth between the past and the present. Nevertheless, it's a quick read and a pleasant diversion."
2,S is for... huh?,"I love Kinsey Milhone and I love this series. But by the time the killer was unveiled, I'd long forgotten who the person even was in the story... and I wasn't interested enough to go back and read the book again."
2,poorly researched,"Have read a lot of the reviews of this book, and no one seems to notice how disappointing the flashbacks are. Grafton has not done her homework! 1)Little houses, even the newer ones, did not have showers in 1953; only wealthy people had such luxuries, we ordinary folk had bathtubs, only. 2)Television sets could not be carried into the schools for all the kids to watch; they were much too large and too heavy, besides they had to be hooked up to an antenna on the roof! Schools didn't have such things in 1953 (I went to school in Calif around that time.) 3)Don't get your ""panties (or undies) in a wad"" was not colloquial phrase in those days. It is much more recent. There are lots of other ""gaffes"" but those three stand out. Reading the book became a hunt for mistakes instead of a good story read."
4,Terrific.....until the ending,"I found myself unable to put the book down; the structure of the novel, alternating between Kinsey's investigation and flashbacks to 1953, the days leading up to Violet's disappearance, is very effective. The characters are well-defined and Sue Grafton makes them come to life through dialogue which always rings true.However, I was disappointed by the ending. While we find out what happened to Violet, and who is responsible for her disappearance, we are left to speculate as to that person's motives. We never find out what happened in the crucial last hours and there are a number of loose ends and unanswered questions. If not for that, I would have given the book five stars, but I like my mysteries wrapped up tidily."
3,Disappointed,Not enough said about the landlord and the goings on at Rosies. That was all part of the charm of the previious books in the series. It didn't seem like the same Kinsey. Too many characters to keep up with. Not sure if interested in buying T.
4,Well done.,"It seemed for a while now that Ms. Grafton was growing bored with the series, but she has definitely done a turnaround in S is for Silence. I think by writing chapters in the past and allowing the reader to find out gradually what happened during Violet's days works very well. Although Kinsey is not the Kinsey experienced in the rest of the series, wise-cracking and self-deprecating, I still enjoyed her. I viewed it as a sign that Kinsey is being allowed to mature. It took a few chapters for this story to grab me but once it did, I found I couldn't put it down. Each view into the past had me convinced a different suspect was guilty -- so to me that says, good job."
2,S is for Stop,"I've loved Sue Grafton and Kinsey Milhone since ""A"" but a little less lately. I only finished this book because I was on a long flight to South America with nothing else to read. Could the dialogue been just a little more cliched, the characters a little more flat, the denouement a little more disappointingly presented? Grafton can do much, much better. I wonder where her editors were on this one. After so many novels in the series her desire for experimentation is understandable, but she seems a little bored. I hope she gets her mojo back; I'm going to be very cautious about purchasing the next one."
4,A Good one,"I liked this one, not my favorite Grafton, but a good read. The Kinsey character is always fun to follow and the detailed mystery is the usual well-crafted fare that you'd expect from Grafton. I recommend it to those following the alphabet series."
3,Not Too Good,I hadn't read any of these. I understand this one is a bit different. It started well enough. Then there were a series of flashbacks. This works better with a movie. I ended up skipping around. The way it was solved wasn't very satisfactory. I didn't like the main character. Maybe if you are familiar with her already it would help.
2,Not Her Best Effort!,"""S is for Silence"" is part of the Alphabet Mystery Series by Sue Grafton. The silence is the death of a hot blooded young mother/wife/woman named Violet Sullivan who disappeared with her dog and a new car on Independence Day. Her daughter, Daisy, cannot find closure on this cold case over 34 years old. She was just 5 years old when her mother disappeared. Some think her father did it, some think Violet just ran away with another man. Daisy needed to know and hired Kinsey Millhone a female Private Investigator to see what she can find out in 4 days, if anything.The book gets tedious with detail and flows back and forth in time to 1953. A Japanese Robe that Violet wore is mentioned and you think it is key to the story. The best part is a surprise in how she disappeared, which is more than half way through. However, the ending was disappointing and did not make sense. You finish with ""Huh?"""
2,"""S"" is for Sex","I have read every book in this series and this is the only one that has dissapointed me. While Grafton retains her terrific skill setting a scene, all of the other enjoyable trademarks are missing. There is no interaction in her personal life other than a couple phone calls and a quick hello. She included about six chapters written in first person by the suspects and players in the crime - which naturally adds no addition to the investigation since Kinsey doesn't have this information. Grafton doesn't need something this sloppy to add to the tone of the book. Addtionally, Grafton leaves out the trademark closure chapter we have all come to know and love. Lastly, if I wanted graphic sex scenes I would have purchased a romance novel. We made it from A-R without them - why start now?"
2,**SPOILER ALERT**** disappointing,"I usually like the Kinsey mysteries.. as a matter of fact, I buy them in hardcover as a treat to myself. Today, I spent all day in bed reading it. (It's a ritual for me.) But I was disappointed in ""S"". When I got to the end, I was thinking TOM? WHO THE HECK IS TOM? And I thought the idea that he was going to bury Kinsey in her car was just a little too much silent movie drama. And this is too bad because I really really look forward to my Kinsey stories! I'll try again with ""T"". I guess I am just stubborn."
3,Glad I read it but not her best,"I've read them all and this is better than a few of her most recent in the series but not as good as some of the older ones. I'm not sure if it's the time delay over the years but Kinsey hasn't grown with me. I started reading the series when she was older than me and now I've passed her by and she's still stuck looking for pay phones instead of using a cell etc. etc. I understand Grafton can't have her aging along with us or we'd have an octogenarian scaling walls, breaking into suspects homes and so on. Not sure what the answer is... with seven more books to complete the alphabet I may be the 80 years old by the time she gets to Z is for Zonked Out."
2,"THERE WAS NO ""WHY""","I agree with the comment earlier that there is no why in the end. Every reader wants to know why he committed such a heinous act. If it is greed, greed is too simple for this book because everybody is greedy in one way or another. Please, next time Grafton, let us in on the reason for a person's demise, especially if you have the audacity to take us back 30 years."
2,felt compelled to read but mostly disappointed,"I too have read most of Graftons series and have enjoyed the lively/comic nature of her main detective character. But I found her to be very shallow and cold to read in this book. I applaud the author on trying a new way to tell a story so as not to become stale, but the ""person who did it"" was totally boring and a let down. I had to go back and read parts of the book to remember who he was. I really didn't like the ending, I expected more."
4,Great Book But Was She In A Bad Mood?,"I have read every one of Sue Grafton's Alphabet Mysteries. This one wasn't my favorite but I still couldn't put it down! The time-jumping was really captivating.But... when she revealed ""whodunit"" at the end I was left wondering if I had missed something...But what really keeps me pondering the book is that the attitude of the book seems so much harsher than her others. I can't help wondering if Sue Grafton was in a bad mood or was feeling pessimistic about human nature when she wrote it."
3,Series is evolving...but not for the better.,"The Kinsey character was one of a kind but not for long! S is for Silence is extremely disappointing. The plot was weak and the Kinsey character is becoming drab. Where's her wit and hilarious one-liners? She has become passive and dull and her adventures mild and predictable. Sue Grafton is changing the character's personality, lifestyle and adventures. Has anyone else noticed that all of Kinsey's misadventures are slowly disconnecting from the best parts of the series? Where are the regular day in and day out characters Henry, Rosie and her recently discovered cousins? What's going on here? I'm applauding Janet Evanovich for staying true and blue to what the readers love...consistent entertainment."
1,A struggle to read,I have loved the alphabet books....till now. This book is slow moving and the constant back and forth between times is irritating. I honestly didn't for a minute care what happened to Violet. In the previous books I knew who Kinsey Millhone was and strongly felt her personality. In this book she seems to disappear. I also miss the usual cast of characters and their input. Very very disappointing.
2,S is for Silence,"I have read all of the books in this series and have enjoyed them, until this one. It was so chopped up, going back and forth between the present and the past when the murder was committed, it was very hard to follow."
4,Spicy Kinsey keeps the intrique alive,"Why do I always get heartburn when I read Sue Grafton's mysteries? Answer: her PI, Kinsey Millhone's diet of spicy foods followed by beer or a few cocktails that's why. I love how Kinsey is as spicy as her food choices and at times, haphazard as one can be after a few when in chasing down the bad guys. And there's plenty of bad guys in S is for Silence. Grafton's characters are bad, good and ugly, but never, every dull and ordinary. Every time I was sure I figured out ""who done it"" Grafton pulled rug out from under my guess. I'm going all the way to Z with her."
4,quick read,"I am an avid reader and like the Sue Grafton books. This one was a quick, easy, and entertaining read. The new format in which the reader gets to read the thoughts of each character/suspect was effective in keeping the suspense going. The fact that the death had occurred thirty-four years ago was interesting and the flashbacks added to the intrigue. Kinsey Millhone, as usual, is an entertaining heroine, who, thankfully, is not without admitted flaws."
3,How many cliches can you fit in one sentence?,"I gotta say, I was disappointed with this one, and I'm a big Kinsey fan. While I applaud Grafton's desire to stretch herself re plot construction (deftly weaving flashback and present tense rather than the usual ""A then B then C"" approach), I was appalled by the constant tired cliches, sometimes strung out in threes and fours in a single sentence. An inside joke, perhaps? And where was Kinsey's trademark wry, self-deprecating wit--such a large part of this character's appeal? Sorry, but without it the whole thing felt flat. Perhaps Kinsey's getting tired; knocking around Santa Theresa's gotta be getting old. Or is it that Grafton's just ready to move on?"
4,S is for Semi Spectacular,"Sue Grafton's writing is mesmerizing. S is for Silence was less satisfying however than some of its predessors. It was touching, and enthralling, but....it had none of the personal insights that some have had....AND I would wish to know so much more about our heroine/detective Kinsey....But...it certainly gives us a careful insight into a small town -- microcosm of all our towns -- the people who live and inhabit our neighborhoods...and proves AGAIN that human beings all have similar traits...and similar loves...and similar experiences."
2,S is for Slow Read,"Normally, I find it hard to put a Sue Grafton book down once I get started. Not the case with ""S"". I did not enjoy the plot about Violet and her abusive husand. The main character Violet was too much of a stereotype - boobs, red hair, just a boozing slut over all. I didn't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her. The ending wasn't clear either. I did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades. Most of the characters just weren't that interesting overall.I missed her interactions with Rosie the restaurant owner and her neighbor, the handsome 80 year old baker Henry. Usually, there is an interesting man in the picture too - not here.I would vote pass on this one."
3,Cause for concern,"I have read all of the alphabet books by Sue Grafton and enjoyed them immensely; however, S is for Silence was a disappointment. It lacked ""life."" It also lacked a richness in her characters as found in previous books. Even Kinsey was blah. The constant flashbacks to the 1950's was tedious. This book just didn't deliver and I was left wanting."
3,Not one of her best,"In this book, Kinsey is hired to solve a cold case-34 years cold. Because Grafton kept going back and forth from 1953 to 1987, the book was hard to follow and didn't have the easy to read flow that we have in her other books. Maybe ""T will be better."
2,Groundhog Day,"I eagerly awaited this novel. I have read A-R. Some are better than others. Maybe it was my anticipation, but this one disappointed me.Perhaps if it had been 100 pages shorter-why are so many books and movies currently on the just too long side-where are the editors. I felt as though the same information was repeated over and over and over again like in the movie Groundhog Day. Slightly different twist in each retelling, but not enough to make me eager to steal away and sit and read. Even the killer was disappointing to me.I did not find any new or evolving information about Kinsey in this novel either. I love a series' book that continues to evolve and sculpt the main character of the series. I really did not find any new info here. And most of the usual players of the Milhone series were missing or mentioned so slightly in passing.I will continue to read the series. Groundhog Day only occurs once a year, hopefully no more in this series."
3,Silence,"I found this book tedious to read--I'm sorry to say. The plot was intriguing, but the constant scenery details--both regarding the outside surroundings and home decor descriptions--as well as the character's physical descriptions and clothing, in my opinion, took away from the story itself. If a reader loves the details I mentioned above, then this series is for you."
2,S is for Sleepytime,"This book put me to sleep every night. So much detail about everything and uninteresting characters. I got half way through this book and skipped to the end and then had to go back and see who Tom was and WHYdid he do it?? Sue Grafton's earlier books were great, fun and interestingcharacters, whatever happened?????Carol in North Vancouver, B.C."
4,Wish they would do some movies,"Standard Kinsey Millhone fare, which I love. If they ever do make a move they must get Ellen Degeneres to play Kinsey. Whenever I read I picture her in the part."
4,Transporting into Kinsey's shoes is one of my favorite pasttimes!,"Sue Grafton really knows her character, Kinsey. (Perhaps Kinsey is her alter-ego.) Anyway, I love her! Been reading since ""A is for Alibi""; recommend the whole series if you like light, comical (at times), well-done mysteries for relaxing evenings at home."
1,I've read them all...worst yet,I found the story line completely incoherent...too bad the publisher was in such a rush to publish that they didn't have time for a good edit...
1,Disappointed,"I've read all of Grafton's alphabet series and was very disappointed with ""S is for Silence"" simply because she seemed to take a downward spiral with language and sexual content. I will no doubt not be finishing the series if she continues down this path. Could have been a good read without all of that."
3,Good book but not Kinsey Millhone,"The central character of this book should have a different name. This was totally out of character for the somewhat ditzy, charming Kinsey Millhone. She with a history of a fear of guns and is now shooting with a high powered weapon. Her eccentric friends that add a bit of interest to the alphabet series were mostly missing. There were also some long drawn out conversations that took up pages that added little to the content of the story. Perhaps I'm to old to enjoy teenage telephone talk. Overall a fairly good story but not Kinsey Millhone."
1,A confirmed reader,"I have not read any of Milhone's books before, although I am a great reader of mysteries... this will probably be my first and last. I am ready to try another to be fair, but it took me weeks, instead of my usual hours, to get through it."
1,S is for Slow,"I knew there was a reason I stopped buyiny Grafton's alphabet books some letters ago. Boring details about every thing under the sun forced me to look at book jacket to refresh my brain just what I was reading about. Oh yes, the red head. Finally I skipped to last chapter and had trouble wading thru that. Mystery, yes. Adventure, action,suspense, no. Sorry I spent the time and money on it."
4,Can't wait for 'T',Have read all A-S and really enjoyed them.. What will we do when we get to Z. Sue Grafton can't stop there!!!!!
3,"Good, but not great.","I enjoy Grafton as a reliably good read although liked this less then some of her other books. The events in the story are told from the perspective of numerous characters and I became tired of the story being told and re-told. None of the characters were particularly compelling or sympathetic. As for Kinsey, she was almost a secondary character and I found myself shaking my head at some of the patently dumb things she did. There was very little suspense-one scene at the end but even then you never felt any real threat. Don't misunderstand; it wasn't awful, but it lacked some of the spark of her other books."
4,Not bad but not her best,"Kinsey is probably aging a little. She doesn't seem quite so feisty and willing to take chances as she used to. I missed the interplay with Rosie and Henry, but the other characters were given enough rounding that they seemed real most of the time. They did, however, smack of stereotypes--Violet, the wild one; Liza, who adored her; Kathie who was such a dork; Jake the stud, etc. The mystery of what happened to Violet was not much of a surprise after the first mention of the road equipment. That was a giveaway. All in all, it was good enough to keep me reading to the end. I hope the next one is more exciting."
2,Did Grafton Write This!,"After anticipating each release of A-R my friends and I are wondering if Grafton even wrote this one. Gone are the delightful Kinsey traits, quirky friends and questionable love interests. Grafton has also dropped the quest for finding the lost relatives introduced a few books back.If this had been ""A"" there would have been no ""B"" for me. This was a very pedestrian mystery and a very boring Kinsey."
2,Very disappointing!,"I just finished this book. As a longtime fan of the series, I am so disappointed in this one. Kinsey is normally a great, strong female character. But she repeatedly does the most stupid stuff in this book. She acts more like those females in the horror movies that are so oblivious to danger and walk right into it. I spent the last quarter of the book rolling my eyes as she did one stupid thing after another. There are too many plot points that just disappear or are never explained. Very disappointing!"
3,S is for Spark-less,"I have loved the Kinsey Millhone mysteries from the day I read the first one 12 years ago. The problem I'm having now is that I've aged, Sue Grafton has aged, the whole world has aged, but Kinsey has only aged 4 years. I feel like the series is getting stuck. I would have liked to see Sue advance a few years in order for Kinsey to grow and change. Yes, it means her favourite landlord would have ""passed on"" but it would allow for new characters and change in Kinsey's life. This book also seems to be missing the humour that is part of what makes this series so great to me. Just my humble opinion."
2,Not her best!,"Unfortunately this is not a great book. I have faithfully read all of the ""alphabet mysteries"" and have enjoyed them all. This was a struggle to get through. Way too much description and detail, and way too much jumping from ""then to now to then to now"". Hopefully ""T"" will be back to Ms. Grafton's better writing style."
1,"S is for ""shabby""","I am sorry to see Sue Grafton digress from what kept me reading her series. Mainly her character Kinsey, whose charm and quirky personality kept the books alive. In this latest book, I would describe Kinsey as boring and depressed. She portrayed little joy in the job or her own life.If this is the path Sue Grafton is going down, ""S"" Is For Silence is my last read in her series."
2,TERRIBLE ending,"This book was ""character heavy"" - good heavens, I had to go back and reread several chapters to remember who was who. And, this ending is terrible - much too abrupt and insufficiently explained. I never did get exactly why she was killed!? After all the heavy character discussion, why not have a good ending telling WHY, WHEN, and HOW Violet was killed. And what did the dog have to do with anything? I was very diappointed and felt let down by the ending. Also, I'd have liked a little more detail about the lives of Liza, Daisy, and Tannie after the murderer was discovered."
2,Disappointed in Sue Grafton's latest novel,"I just finished Sue Grafton's latest novel and was so disappointed that I have to write my first review. The previous novels in this series were fun because Ms. Grafton had taken the time to develop an interesting character: Kinsey. In S is for silence, Kinsey's personality is nowhere to be seen and as a result the book is, well, boring. I wouldn't be surprised if she heavily relied on a ghost writer for this novel because the dialogue is so different."
3,What a disappointing ending!,"I've been patiently collecting this alphabet mystery series over the last several years, some books have been better than others.Sue Grafton's lastest book, builds up with some good suspense as to who actually killed Violet. But when the culprit was finally revealed, I was left with a huge HUH?There weren't enough clues in the book to make you connect the killer to the crime. Because of that, the book didn't really come together nicely for me and was a waste of time as I had carefully followed all the subplots and paid attention as I usually do in a mystery book.Sue Grafton really got into a lot of lewd descriptive sex scenes in the book, which was more I have noticed in other books in the series. I could have done without the sex scenes and would have liked a better coherent satisfying plot line instead.Too many unanswered questions and a letdown for me. Will I get the T book when it comes out? I'm not sure I will."
3,Long way for not much,"Don't get me wrong, I love Sue Grafton and her familiar style of writing. You feel like you're having a conversation with someone instead of reading a book. But this one hints that Grafton may be running out of steam. I like the flashback sections, because with such a cold case, how else can you divulge the information the characters know that Kinsey doesn't? But from everything she sets up and what the reader learns from those flashbacks, Grafton pulls the ending out of thin air, and then suddenly the book is over. It didn't even get exciting until very near the end, and then it doesn't end any way she lead you to believe. I mean, twist endings are always fun, but this ending is built on the thinnest of threads of rationale of all the character set ups. It took me longer than usual to get through this one, and there was no pay off. And now I'll have to wait another year for the next one. I shouldn't have read all the others so quickly!"
2,Mine was missing a chapter also!,"I actually appreciated Grafton's new style of going back and forth in time. I understand she is trying to explore her potential while being stuck in a 26 books series contract. Still, I found that I kept wanting to skip to the end of the book. After finally making it through the whole book, I was very disappointed in the ending. Spoiler Warning - How could he have been the murderer? He supposedly had been her lover long enough to give her the dog?!??! Yet, Grafton spent a whole chapter making it clear he was the only guy who never tried to get in Violet's pants (the character's wording). That was just one of the loose (or downright conflicting) ends. I made my husband promise me he would not let me read T is for ...."
2,I think she has hit the Patricia Cornwall problem,"I read this book on CD. I think the author has hit the Patricia Cornwall problem for me. This is where the first few books are really good and then they start getting really poor. I finally gave up on Patricia when she ran out of gas. I now feel the same about Grafton. Going to have to move on and find someone fresh again. This book simply was not good, left too much undecided and simply ended with a lot of holes in the plot. Good luck on ""T""."
3,unsatisfying ending,"I agree with other reviewers that there was too little of Kinsey and also her neighbor and hangouts,etc. The flashbacks were at first confusing, but then I started to get into those characters. the last half of the book had me page turning. But the ending was not explained to my satisfaction. who cares that Daisy didn't keep in touch for a year after the investigation. I wanted to know the motivation for the killing. I wanted to know what happened to Violet on her last day and why. What was her relationship with Tom? I also wanted to know if Tom got the money from the ""forgotten"" account and if so why did he need more money. it wasn't explained and i was left disappointed. the only satisfying part was when Liza let Kathy have it over the Ty incident. I gave a three because loose ends were not tied up and it's not a book I would read again."
5,The Journey Back!,"Very impressed!!! The author is in the ""know"". That special place so many of us have searched for so long. The truths from this writing can put the seeker back on his unique path of rememberance."
5,Good Read,This was an easy read and very helpful in daily life. I would recommend it to anyone who in interested in improving day to day living circumstances.
3,You have Chosen to Remember,"This book. ""You have Chosen to Remember: A Journey from Perception to Knowledge"", has some good things in it but was not what I exxpected. He speakes about ""Out of Body Experiences"" OBE. The farther I got into the book the stranger some of the ideas became."
1,Each To His Own,"This was one of those books that went from first read to the trashcan. I can get some good out of nearly every book, but not this one."
1,Fails to Operate Consistently,"This unit fails to operate consistenly unless the rubber button cover is pressed in exactly the right spot. The manufacturer needs to re-design the button cover or make it from plastic, metal or some other rigid material so when pressed the cover contacts the concealed button underneath hard enough to activate the doorbell or chime. It is a nice looking unit but we have missed many visitors at our door because it simply didn't activate our chime."
3,Loved this bell until...,"This bell worked great for about 2 years and now it won't chime unless pushed in the exact right spot. I changed the battery thinking that was the issue but it didn't help. Very disappointed that it didn't last. My friend has the same unit, about the same age, and she has had the exact same problem.I've missed visitors several times because of this."
5,Old is new again,This doorbell worked immediately with the 13 year old Home Depot (musta been a Heath Zenith unit) bell I have. Great day! Nice looking too.
5,Great movie!!,"I love movies made in Ireland or the U.K. and this one does not disappoint. Great story, great actors. If you're into a good storyline without anyone getting blown up, decapitated, terrorized, etc., then you'll really enjoy this film."
5,Clarinet Reeds,"There's not much to say about these. They're Clarinet Reeds, and they excell in that capacity. Buying them in a box of 10 is substantially cheaper than buying smaller packs."
5,This antenna helped our network immensely.,"I live on a 40-acre property with three buildings, and we wanted all three to be able to share one network. We tried all kinds of setups, but the third building never had a reliable connection. So I ordered two of these, and put one up in the office where my computers are. The signal now reaches the farthest building and beyond, and their signal strength went from fair/poor/not even working to excellent! We didn't even need to set up the second antenna. I'm very pleased with this product!"
4,Signal Strength in Rural Areas,"We found this repeater to do the job in a country setting. Of course it is line to site so we had to trim a few limbs along the way, but for the most part the signal came through at higher levels than we first thought it would. The product has done what we required it to do. We are satisfied with this repeater."
5,Simply Delightful,All you really have to know is that this product does exactly what it says. The extention of range that I witnessed was absolutely amazing. Thank you Hawking.
2,Hawking Antenna,"I am not that excited about the Hawking Directional Antenna. I have some twiking to do still but right out of the box it did not improve my reception over a little 3 inch bidirectional rubber antenia. On a positive note the seller was very quick with shipping the product and everything was packaged well. Thanks, Rudy N."
1,Provided no noticeable increase,"After fairly thorough and methodical experimentation, this product used together with a wrt54GL running Tomato firmware provided no increase in range or signal strength when used as a directional antenna."
4,"Good antenna, but spotty technical support from Hawking. Buy if you know what you're doing.","I purchased this to extend the range of a Linksys E2100 router over a community pool area (801.11g). The antenna does a fine job of sending a strong signal from one corner of the facility (roof mounted inside a pump room) to most of the pool area.The antenna came with a 2-way mount, a surge suppressor, adapters, and instruction manual. I can't think of anything I'd add.Unfortunately, I've tried to ascertain what settings for the antenna and transmission power to provide the DD-WRT firmware. Hawking hasn't answered me. :("
2,dissappointed,"This antanna Definately helped our wireless signal, but I still needed a repeater. It didn't reach near the distance promised. At least not with a good enough signal for a wireless desktop."
1,Did not receive what was advertised,"This book was advertised as a hardcover which is why I ordered it, but I received a softcover version. The company apologized and refunded my money, but hopefully they have fixed the description of this item in Amazon."
3,Ernie and Bert's New Kitten,"Ernie and Bert's New Kitten is a very good book. I enjoyed it a lot. The book is about a kitten that Bert and Ernie's neighbor's cat has. The boy's beg and beg until they finally get the kitten. They think that it will all be fun and games, until the kitten starts to wreak havoc on their house and destroy their things. My favorite part was when Ernie started trippin' because the kitten chewed a hole in his rubber ducky and before that when he was singing to the rubber ducky. The book teaches little kids responsibility and how important it is to take care of your things, especially if it is a living thing, like a kitten. It also has very colorful pictures that go with the story very well."
3,"Interesting concept, but a little strange in its execution.","I love all kinds of music - from punk to classical.When I saw that a string quartet was covering Taking Back Sunday's music, my interest was immediately piqued. The few samples I listened to amused me, and I bought it.While it's certainly innovative, it actually weirds me out a little bit to hear these familiar tunes played in such a different manner. I've only listened to the CD a few times since the purchase because of that.The quartet is very, it's just not quite my cup of tea."
2,Two seasons,"2nd change: I have a large piece of property that I have used this sprayer on over the last two years. I have found the pump action to be a bit jittery and requires a lot of pumping to keep up the full pressure.Tried to start it up on the third season, and it would not work.Cleaned everything out and still does not work. For $140.00 a sprayer should last longer than two seasons without a major rebuild. Note: Total disassembly showed that the two major washer/seals had failed, so parts on order; Cost for seal parts $147.31 for a $140.00 sprayer (Don't I feel like a schmuck, I could have had a new sprayer for the cost of a few seals from SP). If you don't require 70+psi, go with the Stanley/Chapin sprayer (60psi) at less than 1/3 the price, it also has a full manual and you can pump it when sitting on a flat surface. (Better design, less money!!!)"
1,My first try !,"This review is probably a bit premature but here goes. I was impressed with the SP-2 when I first received it, the way it was designed and put together. After assembling the few pieces necessary to make it work I tried pumping with the handle without results. So i read the different fixes and with a gallon of water to simulate a normal liquid I tried again without any results. I really would like to make this unit work as I think it is a better designed unit over the box store models so I got a return shipping label and sent it back to the shipper and hope to get a better working unit in the near future. Hopefully I will be satisfied with the replacement."
1,Would not buy SP2 again,"This sprayer had a few problems from day 1 achieving pressure. It would work fine and then not work at all. I called SP customer support and got the run around. Honestly, it was one of the worst customer support teams I have ever dealt with. They told me to check the seals. I took the pump completely apart and all of the seals were lubed and brand new. After reassembly the unit would still not pressurize. I purchased the SP2 because it was rated as professional and I wanted a high quality unit for home use. You may be luckly to get a unit that works but I would honestly not recommend taking the chance. After reading other reviews, it appears several people have had a similar issue so surely SP knows there are quality problems with the units."
1,ORDERED IT 3 MONTHS AGO STILL NOT SHIPPED,I would love to review this product if it would ever arrive.This is thsecond time that I have ordered this sprayer.Last time after several months I gave up and did not renew the delivery date and so the order was canceled.If they do not have the product to sell why say so.Very frustrated with Amazon.COM at this point.
5,Great Christmas album,"Since the mid 80's thia has been a part of Christmas awith my family. Love the traditional and the new as well. ""It's Christmas"" is my new non-taditional favorite. Ronnie, do another Christmas album"
3,Get Dachshunds for Dummies instead,This book seems more like an insert breed here kind of book than a book about Dachshunds. I am a first time owner and I found Dachshunds for Dummies a much better book.
5,"Thunder, Thunder, Thunder, Thundercats HOOOOOOOOOO","You know, I'm not in a position to judge this objectively. I just can't. I think it rocked. The only really annoying thing is that they did a good job of drawing it so everybody looked the same as in the cartoon, except they gave Cheetarah a different face. That sucked. A lot. I'm more than a little P.O.'d about it. But aside from that, I thought this was a lot of fun. It makes me happy."
5,A wonderful performance.,Hai-Ye Ni's performance is world class. Bravo! I will be giving copies of this CD to friends as a gift.
1,terrible in every way,No plot even though it is supposedly based on a true story. Terrible acting despite descent actors. Action is sub par at best. The worst chinese film I have ever seen. Avoid this one for sure.
3,worth a rental!,"This movie is worth a rental. Good, solid action mixed with cool characters. The first hour is better than the second hour, which tended to wander all over the place and unfortunately dragged this review down to a 3 star. I agree that wu jing wasn't used to his potential, but the other great cast members make up for that. Don't be fooled by the western theme-this movie has elements like the sound track that are sort of western and it's in the desert, but the movie is mainly a straight up bounty hunters/cops protect witness from assassins and all mahem breaks loose. It's fun, action filled, quirky entertainment worth watching for fans of asian movies."
5,very relaxing mood music,"Living in Omaha we frequently have access to Chip Davis music. This one cannot be kept in the stores like most of his works and compilations. Anything that Chip Davis has contact with is more than worth listening to. Relax, and enjoy this with someone you care about."
4,Good little case,"Twice as big as the standard case for our Canon A590IS; holds cables, batteries, cards, but it's a stretch to get the instruction manual in too."
5,What excuse do you have NOT to buy these?,This purchase is an amazing deal. I find Expo markers to be of quality as well as durable and even attractive. This gives you a great set because even Expo eventually run out (especially when even the most careful of children are using them). Great deal on these!
2,Check your markers,"I purchased these early in the summer as a part of the upcoming school supplies. Shame on me for not checking that each pen had ink. Half of them had white tips (no ink). By this time, I had thrown the boxes out. Check your order so you can return it if need be!"
5,Good Markers,"Can't beat the original expo markers.They last 2-3 times longer then the non-odor, and due to these being fine tip(smaller) the smell is not bad at all.I purchased green because they were three to four dollars cheaper then all the other expo original fine tips (except red, which I don't like to use on my board, .....feels angry)The green shows up great on my little board I use to work out math problems for my math courses. (I was going through notebooks like crazy, and I picked this whiteboard trick up when I was in the tutoring center)Good Deal. Happy Customer."
3,Disappointing,"Most of the scooter was well-constructed and showed the ability to handle its rated weight, but we found it disappointing in a couple of ways. The motor is not really strong enough to do any kind of acceleration while on even a modestly uphill section of road. The front and rear wheel bearings have failed on the scooter, necessitating replacement from Razor (at no cost) and the power wires from the battery to the motor were loose at a connector, causing erratic performance until the connection was tightened."
2,Speed Controller broken,When I got my e500 I was really excited. The speed controller of the throttle if you prefer was cracked. My dad taped it up but it still has a few problems. My friend has an e325s(a variation of the e300) and he has never had a problem with it. I can completely relate to other peoples reviews on Amazon. Razor customer service is poor. Scooter is fast and fun. I wish razor would do a better job sending the scooter.
3,razor e500s scooter,"The product is horrible! Amazon did a great job helping me with the problem but after getting three of these scooters, all broken in the same place, i went to Razor to see if they could help. After assurances that the replacement parts would arrive before Christmas, Santa ended up having to get something else. The replacement parts did not arrive until the Friday after Christmas. Razor is aware of the poor packing job done with their scooters and very uncooperative to get the problems fixed. If you can find a similar scooter out there at another company, buy it because Razor is not a company i would recommend any one do business with!!!!!"
3,Iain is still alive and kicking,"Iain Matthews, a singer songwriter who created in the past superb songs with fairport Convention, Matthews Southern Comfort, made a homogenious album. The live CD is extra and well sounding. It contains several strong songs."
3,One hundred pages too long,"Quozl is at least 100 pages too long. The plot doesn't really start until page 100. This first hundred drags along as combination of hippies in space and Watership Down. There are pages and pages and pages and pages of idiotic descriptions of their sandles, their earings, their grooming habbits, to the point of mind numbing boredom.So future readers, just skip to page 101. Once Runs-red-Talking meets Chad the story finally picks up but it's no where as interesting or compelling as Foster's much shorter and better written Nor Crystal Tears (which I highly recommend)."
3,Original novel from the Sci Fi novelizer.,Foster is real good at writing novelizations. This novel is not as good as most of those.It is humurous in places and is worth the price at a library charity or yard sale.
1,Enormously bad.,"Okay. In two words, ""It sucked."" In about eighty-five words, ""A depressingly simplistic plot with its flesh stretched achingly taut by unengaging filler. Characters that are difficult to remember, much less care about, from page to page, much less from chapter to chapter. No interesting twists that aren't forced and eye-rollingly predictable. No depth. And it doesn't save itself by being written well. This book is written with the same textureless and highly pretentious style of prose as the first-try novelette produced by a freshman in High School who tells everyone he'll be a writer when he grows up."""
4,Missing the point?,"I fail to see why so many other reviewers here are treating Quozl as a failed comedy. It's nothing of the sort. It's a quietly serious and well-written little story that, if you catch it while in the right mood, may stick with you for some time. Foster is a very versatile writer and his enthusiasm for breathless, sprightly adventure fantasy sometimes obscures his ability to write in a more thoughtful mode, but, like most of his less popular books, Quozl will touch more than amuse. I liked it a lot."
3,"Not his best, not his worst","I enjoyed Quozl. Which is ironic considering that I agree with the various faults listed in the various reviews. It is slow. It isn't deep. It doesn't make you roll in the aisles with laughter.It is, instead, nice and lightly funny.I, myself, found the philosophic bits the most amusing, in a quiet contradictory way. One hopes that the author doesn't think that any of the Quozl philosophy makes any sense or hangs together in any way. A dramatically non-violent people with blood spattered pictures on the walls? A free-love society where people fight over sexual dominance? The same non-violent society that spaces a couple for making an illicit child, or that offers murder-suicide as a solution to a diplomatic problem?These tensions make fun reading, but lousy philosophy."
4,coconut oil,"with all the hype out there about the benefits of eating coconut oil, this is certainly a delicious way to be healthy. It is a great oil for cooking. I highly recommend it!"
5,EXTRA VIRGIN COCONUT OIL,"I am very pleased with the item. I know quite a number of people that use the product and they are all very pleased. It was suggested that I give it a try, which I have. I can see the results. It is really good for my skin. You won't know until you give it a try."
3,Fiberglass and Plastic,I ordered this sprayer based on the description given by Amazon. I should have visited the web site of SPSYSTEMSLLC.COM the maker of the sprayer. The Agricultural Series Farm & Home 1 gallon sprayer has a fiberglass wand and plastic nozzle. SPSystems Commercial series sprayers have the brass wand and brass nozzle.Amazon doesn't sell the 1 gallon Commercial series sprayer so you'll have to purchase the 2 gallon sprayer if you want a brass wand and brass nozzle. The description given by Amazon and picture are incorrect. Unfortunately I haven't been able to convince Amazon to change their description.
3,"Maybe ""Lukewarm Together"" would've been a better title!","This 1986 follow-up to the platinum ""Contact"" LP does have some enjoyable tunes (""My Life"", ""Goldmine"" ""All I Know is the Way I Feel"", and the title cut), the bulk of the album is representative of the sound of the 80's.Is that a bad thing? No, it's just that in the past the Pointers took chances and this one doesn't stray from the mold of others during the time.The major highlight is ""Taste"", featuring Ruth in her most ""manly sounding"". She provides the amazing bass vocal.I just wish the rest of the album had been so surprising!"
2,This guy needs a new career.,First off the production is incredible. The guest artists (Wu Tang) are also incredible. So then why 2 stars you ask. Its lucky I gave it 2 stars. If it werent for the guests artist and production it would of gotten a zero.The lyrics & this guys flow are not incredible. His flow is almost really annoying to me and I cannot stand his lyrics and religous views and how he views the United States. He basically lives here but hates our country. Okay then leave. I dont care to hear about your extremist muslim views. Even on the cd Wu Tang states we dont agree with all the views on this cd. To be fair as I said the beats are off the chain if you dont listen to lyrics you will like this if you like old school Wu Tang
2,Deaf Wu Fans?,"""Don't, Don't believe the hype"" (Flava Flav). A great quote for this review. I've been a fan of Wu & affiliates since the 90's. This isn't an album I would ever reccomend to anyone. It's poorly mixed and Cilvaringz isn't a very talented artist. Also if you are American a song called ""Death to America"" might offend. Don't get me wrong I'm open to opinions but I love my country. Artist I would reccomend are Bronze Nazareth, Hell Razah, Sunz of Man present... Hell Razah & 9th Disciple & Killah Priest ""The Offering"". I was impressed by what other people said and bought this album. I've listened to it maybe twice and still can't understand what the hype was about."
2,Severly Dissapointing! Mixtapes Had Bangers!,"I waited for years for this to come out. I hope that Moongod Allah & Barracuda & Cilvaringz would be having alot of releases & great new albums with the Wu Fam never happened. What we get hear is weak beats, & so so rhymes that have gotten worse since this release. Whatever these supposed Wu fans told him that he sounded to much like Wu Tang does not make sense. He should sound like Wu Tang & kept the sound real grimey like the early Wu albums & Killarmy CD's. I don't like any of the new tracks on this cd. Get 2 stars for finally comin out."
3,aiight,"i don't see how sooo many people gave this album 5 stars...i listened to it twice all the way through, it was alright but it wasn't 5 star. some of the beats were questionable and his rhyme style left alot to be desired. the collabos were great and the production was decent...but 5 stars, no i think not"
3,Fun for the kids,Who hasn't dreamed of being invisible. This funny movie explores the question of what could be done if one were invisible. A classic flick. The locker room scene isn't so bad either.
1,WHERE'S MY TAPE,Can not rate the tape as i haven't received one yet? I've waited a month and wrote twice and still no tape???? After reviewing all the comments on this seller i can see a trend of not delivering.....
2,Belly,"This movies picture was right, however it didn't come in its original format. The part in the beginning where they narrate is meeting and at a certain part of the movie the subscripts come on in French and don't go away no matter how you change the settings on the dvd. Movie is good period. I'm just disappointed with the seller not giving me an absolute original new copy that I was promised."
2,"Move 5 stars, 7.1 DTS master bluray 2 stars","Great movie, but it looks like a 720p VHS tape upscale. I have this on DVD also and it looks better on my bluray thru my Onkyo 809 receiver. The 7.1 sound.....isnt like start wars in 7.1, its more like prologic. I think the dvd sounds better. It also looks like a vhs movie."
3,Not all dat bad nor great,"Well hey, I gotta give credit to X and Nas tryin to act, but can't they do a film that's more positive? I mean I'm tired of seein drugs troughout the whole movie, and they come up with a weak message at the end. DMX is like a straight up ryde or die do or die thug in this movie, where Nas tried to send a message in da whole movie and does a pitiful attemt. And the script is poor as well. But at times, it's good 2 see a nice black hood movie, but in my opinion, a menece 2 society was much better. I suggest a rental, or see it on T.V. or record it rather than buy. If u want a good hood movie, get Menece 2 society, or Boyz in da hood."
5,It was a gift!,"I gave this DVD as a gift but I just wanted to say I received it new, sealed and in perfect condition. Thank you"
1,Straight Garbage,"This movie was nothing more than a two hour music video, with a another glorified potrayal of some drug dealers...like we need another one of those. This movie sucked for real, that 2 hrs of my life that I will never get back and I want my money back."
3,Belly,"This movie is alright. It's pretty much like watching one long Hype Williams video, especially the beginning. None of the people in the movie can really act, and the movie is short on plot. Yet, there are some elements of the movie that are worth watching. The music being one, the Jamaican scenes another, and some wonderful body shots of DMX. Overall, it's cool. Nothing special like ""Menace 2 Society"" or anything, but it's cool."
1,YIKES!,"Have to say i love T-BOZ, DMX, NAS, METHOD MAN..but this movie was a joke .. badily made, written, acting.. Save your money.. Pick up the soundtrack instead .."
1,"Tired, incoherent, stupid","I wasn't too fond of this movie, as you can see from one line summary. I like the music of DMX and Nas, and that's what they should stick to. I can appreciate them trying to branch out and do other things, but neither of them has the requisite talent or presence to act. Every tired cliche is dragged out and splattered across the screen, set to music. The highlight here is Malik Hassan Sayeed's cinematography, which looks great as usual. It looks even better with a great director behind it (see ""He Got Game,"" ""Clockers""). And to the idiot who said he wishes Pac were alive to play the role DMX has--Pac would never do anything this bad, buddy. Pac did some bad movies, true, but at least they were coherent."
3,CHECK IT OUT!!!!!!!,"Hype Williams Big screen directorial debut was not at all a total bust, as some would have you to believe. Nas could use a few more acting lesson, sure, but most of the others came across as believeable- that is, if you can identify with the characters. Hype needs only to work on ways to make the language of his films more universally appealing. The dialouge is fine. Well worth seeing."
3,Read Between the Scenes,"Hype William's Big screen directorial debut was not at all a total bust, as some would have you to believe.

4,"Film class, First Class","Unfortunately many minds heard and saw Hype William's Poster for Belly and assumed it to be just another ""hood"" film with an all-black cast most of America can't relate to, and won't go see.However, this film takes place in Manhattan, Queens, NJ... and other areas many of us live. It is also shot by Hype Williams in an extraordinary way. Camera tricks, and lighting give this films aesthetic a pop. The plot didn't wrap properly but Hype attempted to infuse a solid lesson to a strong audience through realism and aggressive camera shots.Sadly many people from outside the hood stereotyped it and only saw one side, and the hood audience only saw the other side (for the most part). So it was underrated and misunderstood. B- Film"
4,"RE: A ""USED AND NEW"" SELLER","DO NOT BUY FROM THE SELLER ""BESTMOVIES,"" GO AHEAD AND GO THROUGH ALL THE PREVIOUS CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS, CHECK THE OTHER SELLERS TOO, YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO SURE, OTHER THAN THAT, MOVIE'S DEFINITELY ABOVE PAR."
5,My hubby loves it...,"Hubby says, ""It's entertaining, good story. "" He's watching it right now. I think it allows good, hardworking men to fantasize what their lives might be like if they were philandering drug dealers making dirty money. Ha.Then they realize, toward the end of the movie, they've got it good, and stop fantasizing over silly half-dressed girls with no self esteem."
3,A good watch...,"A lot of people have no clue that this movie even exists and that's too bad. ""Belly"" is a story about two close friends who are headed in total different directions. The story along the way that's meant to help us out is somewhat a rehash on ""Good Fellas"" and ""Boys N the Hood"" but it keeps you interested. What really makes this a movie worth buying is the images and the music. Keep your eyes open for Method Man's appearence in the movie. If you're into crime movies and eye-candy this is good movie to watch. Not to say that the basics of the movie are not good. The story moves you along with good acting for the most part. I agree with another reviewer who mentioned that there was some pretty bad acting with some of the female parts. Rent this flick and enjoy."
4,Very Underrated movie,"Belly is a visually appealing, complex, and all around solid film. The characters are easy to understand, and make you feel for them in their respective motives. DMX was excellent in his first movie role, and it makes you wonder if he was born for the role of Tommy. Both Nas and Method Man fit into their respective roles as the thug(Sincere) who wants to leave the game, and the joker-like mercenary(Shameek). The cinematography was excellent. The most impressive aspect of ""Belly"" was the dynamic aspect of the characters, and how they change throughout the movie. This is a must see movie, especially for hip-hop fans."
2,"LOOKS GREAT, Less Filling","If you watch Yo!MTVRAPS all day, you've seen this already. It's like if Charles Dickens was digging hiphop. Same story line as Menace2Society, but with a happy ending. Hype Williams pulls out all the tricks he's shown off in hiphop videos for the past few years, nothing new here. Nice opening sequence, even though it's in yet another club where everybody is dropdead gorgeous, and the bullets fly like rain. Nice eyecandy, moderate storytelling. Don't buy, rent, or just watch MTV while reading Iceberg Slim."
2,A gun shot in the Belly.,"Hype Williams is the greatest music video director of all time.This, however, does not automatically mean the transition to film is going to be a good one.The movie is not good. I don't know if it's supposed to be a black Scarface or what, but it's really bad.Rappers are not known for their Oscar-worthy work, and Nas and DMX are no exception. DMX has charisma, but he needs to work on remembering he's reciting lines, not rapping.I love T-boz, but she needs to stick to her day job.Taral Hicks is a good actress, but her talents are wasted here. I don't buy her as a bad girl.I know The Godfather was an inspiration for Hype, but his attempt to give the movie a dark tint backfired. He made it too dark. Everytime I see the movie, I mistakenly think I'm looking at a bootleg or something.Hype should start over in film by directing material written by someone else."
1,sm-elly,"This movie is terrible. DMX and NAS are terrible. The actresses don't even pretend to have been picked for talent...just sexual impression. Every major climactic scene (and there are several) is stolen from some other popular film (Scarface, Malcolm X seem to be the most popular). The plot makes no sense. You can't hear the dialogue half the time. The rare times when DMX doesn't have a blunt in his mouth he's just grunting...I hate everything about this film."
4,"Great Movie, Bad Acting",The problem with Belly is not the story or the plot it's some of the actors. DMX is sick in this film because he's relating to himself and using it to act. Even Method Man made you feel him and believe his role but there were some weak links. Nas was Ok but he needed some more emotion to make you feel Sincere and T-Boz was the same way but she tried hard. The truth is Belly is almost a perfect movie but some of the actors weren't adding up to this great story. Belly actually teaches you that even when you hit the bottom you don't have to stay there. This isn't just another hood flick just to show off meaningless shootouts and drug deals this movie has a moral and shows you how a man who only knew one way of life chose a different direction when it came to the last few minutes.
4,Belly of the beast,"Belly is my favorite movie due to one scene: the scene when a group of men dressed in all black with automatics and beamers run into Lennox's {played by Louie Rankin} (the Jamaican druglord who is Tommy's connection) mansion and tries to kill him; drunk and high, he manages to kill them all with an assault rifle (chrome AK-47) by dodging the beamers and hiding behind walls, but it really gets good when he is lying on the floor killing the surrounding intruders but gets kill by a masked woman who jumps on his back and slices his throat ""she must be a fan of SOULJA SLIM"" that is the best scene I ever seen in a movie, although the copied SCARFACE's last scene"
5,It was a great movie for those that like weed and violence,"I thought it started sick( cool, the drugs, sex and killing. DMX played an exceptional role and Nas as well. We can't forget Method Man, he played beautifully as well. If U don't get the slang don't buy it."
3,it was aight,"this movie started out TIGHT! I loved the begining, but it soon after lost my interest. It was really hard to follow all the characters, especially since some had many different nik-names it was hard to follow who was who."
1,Another horrible 1990s Black film,"I just cannot believe how terrible the acting in this film was. Hype Williams needs to stick to making videos. While Belly had the sleek look of Williams' MTV fare, it lacked substance, as most videos do. Also, would someone PLEASE tell these wanna-be actors that just because you sell 1 million records, IT DOES NOT MEAN YOU CAN ACT! The performances of Nas, T-Boz, DMX, and the others are just horrid. I was shocked that Taral Hicks was in the abysmal waste of time. Like many black actresses, here career has gone nowhere fast. Boy the 1990s black films have just been an embarrassment to the black actors, actresses and filmmakers who worked so hard and suffered so many indignities to get black people in films to where they are today."
1,What a piece of SH*T,"Are you kidding me?!! NAS sold out as a rapper, appearing with Puff Daddy. What a joke he is. I have no respect for him anymore. DMX has no lyrical ability and he never did. His music is boring,and is definetly not stimulating. Hype Williams should stick to making music videos because he has no capacity for a story. The funny thing is, the lack of ability that these guys have musically is doubled when it comes to the film. Nas and Dmx ARE TERRIBLE ACTORS."
1,The movie was absolutely pointless!,The movie was not good at all and I think that it stunk! The only thing it has going for it is it's all star cast! Definitely a thumb down! And don't player hate because I'm Zela from No limit and I love rap/hip-hop baby! Mad shout out to my boo Tyson!
3,Well...,"I expected a larger upgrade in HD, but it looked little better than an up-converted DVD (on the best up-convert players) on BD. Menu was horrible and primative. The video extras were in not so good quality. Not as bad as I am writing, but just not the big step up that I thought or expected.I can see the set ups of re-releases starting now. For they give us something, then what was not in HD sound they re-release in it, then they re-release again with extras in HD, and at last they give us ""enhanced color"" versions that ""bring out even more details.""This movies is good because of the rappers. It goes to show that aside from the rap music not being as good and the cell phones, 1998 looks no different than 2008! In fact, the same can be said for 1995/96 and 2008. Practically the same."
3,LOVE THE FILM HATE THE DVD,"I PERSONALLY AS A PROFESSIONAL FILMMAKER LOVE THIS FILM.HOWEVER THE ORIGINAL DVD PROMISIES THAT THERE IS ENOUGH DELETED SCENES TO MAKE BELLY A 3 HOUR FILM!SO THEN I SEE THAT THE ""SPECIAL EDITION"" IS RELEASED AND I BUY IT ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT IT HAS ONE DELETED SCENE.THAT ISN'T A DELETED SCENE AT ALL! ITS A DELETED SHOT.IT SUCKED ASS.SORRY BUT THIS DVD SUCKS ASS. THE SPECIAL FEATURES SUCK ASS.THEY HAVE SPOKEN WORD FEATURETTES ON THE DVD. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DIDNT KNOW ITS JUST PEOPLE ON STAGERECIETED POEMS.PISSED ME OFF TO NO END.HOWEVER IT IS A CLEANER TRANSFER OF THE FILM."
5,Probably one of the best black films of 1999.,"This is a masterpiece directed by one of the unknown directers who will soon be noticed for a long time. Its got Nas, DMX, T-boz, Method man and many more known stars. Its wicked and if you haven't seen it you better and if you don't you missed out."
5,"The best directed movie, it was like a long music video.....",The best movie I have ever seen in my life
4,Excellent and Different,"This movie was an awakening to young urban females and males like myself. At first, the movie showed the ""perks"" of living your life as if it were a rap video but it also showed the consequences of that life style and the choice on whether or not you stay in it. They way it was shot was very realistic since activities of that nature usually happen in that specific time frame and the people, the fashion, and the message was very beautiful."
4,Review of Belly,"This film is fantastic, i really enjoyed it and would reccomend it to anyone who is into this sort of thing... it is great and well worth buying.Kayleigh Towler"
4,I liked it,"Belly, I thought, was a pretty good movie. At first it may seem boring and stupid, but by the end it turns out to be an interesting film. DMX did a great job acting, but I am sad to say Nas' acting wasn't as well as D's. Still, Belly is a surprisingly good movie, with only a few errors."
4,I liked it more than i thought i would...,"as far as hip hop movies go, this is a better movie than ""friday"" or "" set it off,""; while its shows the harsh realities of drug dealing and the ""G"" life style, it also shows you that you can turn your life around and do something positive. Nas and DMX don't really ""act,"" they just bring their rap personas to the screen. but they give decent enough portrayals to make the film worth watching. the soundtrack is good also."
4,"good cinematography, real actors","a lot of acting is just letting out your personality, which everyone in this movie did. It may be criminal minded, but the movie is REAL Soundtrack is nice too. A great movie for hip-hop heads who like the stars."
2,A terrific-looking mess.,"Somebody better tell these music/hip-hop stars that platinum sales don't translate into acting ability. Director Hype Williams makes his movie debut that has all the visual energy and style of his music videos for people like P. Diddy and TLC. Sadly, none of that energy is found in the performances, and the script is choppy and unfocused. DMX, T-Boz, and Nas aren't TERRIBLE, but as actors, they don't seem to register on film. This is one of the worst good-looking movies I have ever seen."
1,BELLY FART,"One of the biggest examples of the plasticity exhibited by Hip Hop culture. I am ashamed to even be considered Black after watching this piece of trash. I have since then flung this ""burned copy"" of this film into the incinerator. I hope to never see this type of bad filmmaking ever again. What utter TRASH!!"
2,Don't believe the HYPE (pun intended),"This movie is garbage. Although my friends love it, this film is as amateurish as they come. Hype Williams made this movie look like an extended version of one of his videos. The plot was all over the place, but the film style looked so good that I concluded that Hype used the ""style over substance"" approach. As for the stars, T-Boz should stick to making records because she is not an actress. However, Taral Hicks IS a good actress and singer; T-Boz should take some lessons from her.The only thing I liked about the movie was the ending because 1.) it signified that the movie was over and 2.) DMX's character and the minister play an emotional scene. But DMX and Nas aren't actors, either. Sure, they're actors when it comes to rapping, but that's another story.Hype, making videos and movies are two different things, so think about that before you make your next movie."
4,underground movie classic,belly is a very compeling movie especially if you are from the urban areayou can relate with the concept of this film. if you are not from an urban enviroment its pretty hard to relate to this movie. that's why i think this movie got a lot of negative ratings when it first was release in the theaters. the blue-ray transfer its pretty good i highly recomend this film.
3,The One Truth Known Is Never Even Mentioned,"It was clear in the first episode of the season, ""Emissary"", that the ""Prophets"" were astonished and in disbelief (perhaps even horrified) that linear-time organics like Sisko (let alone the Bajorans that worship them) could even exist. So regardless of the arguments made by the anti-rationalist reviewer here, the one unimpeachable truth we (and Sisko -- though he never brings it up) do know is that the beings living in the wormhole (whatever they are) haven't the slightest clue that a planet of linear-time meatbags have embraced them as gods and built an entire culture around them via religion. With that one irreproachable fact, the Bajoran belief system is rendered false and any other argument becomes superfluous.With that in mind, this episode is about an attempt at political conquest -- people trying to control other people. Religion and murder are simply the means (and time-honored ones at that)."
5,Excellent,"When this series was being broadcast I never got interested in watching it. This is one of those shows where you have to know what has happened in the previous episodes in order to understand the little details. Having it all here in one place made that possible and it's been a joy to watch. Some of the acting is over the top, and you can spot where they reuse cut scenes, but I love it all the same. My favorite character aren't even on all of the episodes."
3,"Great series,dreadful packaging","I have bought many box sets and the Deep Space Nine has the worst packaging that I have ever seen. Series one is enclosed,or should I say sitting between,two thin plastic sidings which fold over it,this is after I had to shake it to remove it from it's thin plastic case.This thin weak casing will not last too long. I have cancelled the rest of my DS9 region 1 orders and will go for region 2 which is encased in a strong and proper plastic case.Paramount USA do not seem to have much regard for their customers as the Star Trek:The Next Generation box sets were also inferior to the overseas cases. But the Next Generation cardboard cases were heaven compared to the thin and hopeless DS9 plastic cases. It's overseas Deep Space Nine box sets for this fan.The series? Great series,lousy packaging."
5,Deep Space Nine -- Star Trek at its BEST!!!,"I can't get enough Star Trek. We have been able to get reruns of all of the Star Treks on TV except--Deep Space Nine. I have not seen it since the last season ended....... Did you know that Deep Space Nine is the link between Next Generation and Voyager?? Yes, besides Chief O'Brien, and later, Worf, being assigned to DS9, Enterprise visits DS9 in the first episode, and Voyager was at DS9 when they were called upon to follow a Maquis ship into the Badlands (when both ships ended up in the delta quadrant)....... I can't wait till it is out!!! Christmas is coming a little late this year."
4,Excellent,"Very good episode one of my favorite of the series. My favorite is the ending ones. However, I can only see this on my TV on the mac side of my computer and none of my players will play it from my windows side. I can see it from the windows side only on the computer screen but my laptop screen isn't big enough so I watch it on line from the web site."
5,Price Change?,"I really love the series and the 1st season was fabulous! A GREAT start to a FABULOUS show, consisting of many revolutionary and original characters. However, does anyone know why the price suddenly changed from $116 to $60. Is this a different edition? I am just curious because I have bought almost the whole series at the $116 price, yet know it is almost half the price."
5,Great New form of Star Trek,...It is a great series though it is somewhat different from the other Trek series. I liked all the characters. I intend to buy the whole DS9 now. Everyone should watch this if he claims to be a true Trek fan. Even non Trek fans will enjoy it as it deals with many present day issues like Terrorism. I recommend it to all.Now about the DVD. The Picture and Sound Quality are great. The only problem I have is with the distribution of Special Features. There are too many Section 31 hidden files which are very small. So it is a nuisance to watch those 2-3 minute clips seperately. Paramount should have integrated these small interviews together. All in all it's a great buy.
4,Typical first season of a show,"As is true with most shows, the first season of DS9 (seen in hindsight) has the actors groping a bit for their ultimate personality and style seen in later seasons. Some of the interactions (between Odo and Quark for example) seem a bit over the top compared to the nuances seen in later seasons. Still, there is a fair amount of backstory covered in this season that makes the later seasons more enjoyable to watch. In my opinion, DS9 was the first Star Trek franchise to work more on a story arc than as individual episodes that could be watched in any order. The quality of the DVD transfer is not as good as later seasons; Likely they didn't preserve the source material like today's shows. The softness/dirtiness of the picture is about what a VHS tape would look like. Not terrible, but not measuring up to today's DVD standards either."
5,"The ""Rodney Dangerfield"" of Trek shows","It is beyond me why this spin-off of the original Star Trek does not garner the support that it so richly deserves. The acting, the scoring, the writing, and the set designs were exemplary in every way.Like most series, the first year allowed the show to ""get its feet wet"". But, one of the show's best installments in its entire seven-year run was ""Duet"", a two-actor tour de force from regular Nana Visitor and guest Harris Yulen.Just this episode alone is worth the purchase of the DVD compilation."
1,The Bottom of the Star Trek Barrel,Star Trek in name only. No spirit; no imagination; no ideas; and impossible stories: an impossible mess of a show. I can't believe this show lasted as long as it did on television.
1,streaming video constant lag,Every 30 seconds or so it paused and said it was connecting. Not cool. Can't imagine buying another instant video from here.
1,I want those few hours of my life back,"What a waste of money and a waste of my time. This show is absolutley rubbish. Never before have I been so dissappointed with a purchase, but this one diserves my dissapointment. Star Trek bores me and bores most people, I highly recommend you DON'T get it. You'll thank me for it"
1,"My favorite ST series, Amazon Instant Video is Great, but....","Aside from not being able to watch these on my TV due to licensing, some of the episodes are missing. I want to watch every episode in order. So you have to look carefully at the number of the episodes to notice that ones are missing, but what you might not realize unless you compare it to an episode listing elsewhere is that the season finale is missing for Season 1. Really, what's the point then...?????"
4,"A slow start, but a good series","Ben Sisko (Avery Brooks) is commissioned by Starfleet to an old Cardassian space station called Terok Nor which Starfleet has re-named Deep Space Nine to safeguard the planet Bajor. He later discovers a stable wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant and is chosen as the Emissary by a race of aliens known as ""The Prophets""BEST EPISODE: DUET"
3,"TOSK, huh?","I'm giving this episode 2.9/5 stars because it's Star Trek, and we meet a new species, learn that there's very advanced and misguided life in the Gamma Quadrant. Plus we learn a Gene Roddenberry lesson about humanity, but not one we haven't been pounded with. Most of the episode it was just ""Tosk, I am tosk."" Tosk this, tosk that. Inconsequential to the Series Story Arc. We never meet another Tosk again in the series. Keep on Trekkin!"
2,I love DS9 but this episode was painful to watch.,I love DS9 but this episode was painful to watch. For every gem of a series there are a couple episode that aren't at the same caliber and this is one of them. Skipping it won't make you miss out on anything at all.
5,The best of the Star Trek series,"Deep Space Nine takes the prize when it comes to good story telling and better quality actors. Much less of the technobabble that Voyager was known for. DS9 excels at creating multiple story lines, some that end each week, some that span over many weeks, keeping the viewing experience exciting. It is much better when viewed on DVD or on Prime than on TV, so you can watch more often and keep up with the story lines. They probably did more in character development than the other shows as well. Instead of running to a new star system each week, you get to experience the opposite, a stable (somewhat) environment of a space station visited by all the different species. This means less filler characters, more story lines, interesting plot twists, and a complete plot that starts in the first episode, but doesn't finish until the last. And of course, there is Quark, who is enough reason by himself to watch the entire series."
2,No Subtitles?!,"I won't even bother watching without subtitles. Neflix is launching Deep Space Nine in a few days, and I'm sure they will have subtitles. Are all Prime Instant videos missing subtitles? Passing on Amazon Prime for now."
4,Seasons 3-7: DS9's new beginning!,"If you want to checkout the ""Dominion arc, and the USS Defiant"" from beginning to end, I recommend you checkout Seasons 3-7, in that order.If you want to checkout ""Captain Sisko and Worf"" from beginning to end, then I recommend you checkout Seasons 4-7, in that order.Season 3 is the real ""new beginning"" of DS9 (introduction of the Dominion, USS Defiant, beginning of story arcs), while Season 4's changes are more on the superficial, aesthetic side (Sisko's bald look, Worf coming to DS9 during the 2nd year of the Dominion arc). I highly recommend you checkout Season 3 first (introduction of the Dominion, USS Defiant, beginning of story arcs), but if you are a person who wants ""absolute, immediate satisfaction"" (i.e. ""How many episodes do I have to sit through, before I finally get to see Captain Sisko and Worf?""), then I recommend you start-off with Season 4."
3,Hallucinations don't mean anything,"The Station is in danger! No it's not, everyone had their punch spiked. Rumpelstiltskin, Really? For an episode about imagination, this one is kind of lacking. 3.4/5 stars because it is representative to Trek Lore, but you can skip this one if you're not adamant about seeing every single episode. Nothing to do with the Dominion or the characters really. Pro: I liked Bashir's hallucination the most! (I've had that same one) ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,Star Trek Deep Space Nine Season 1,This series doesn't really get good until Wharf(sp?) arrives. It gets even better when war breaks out in the later seasons.
4,I am enjoying it as much as the first time,I enjoyed all the different versions of Startrek and it was nice to visit it again. Its refreshing to view it again.
5,Excellent,if you can get through the first couple of season DS9 is by far the best Star Trek has to offer.
4,"Star Trek Deep Space Nine, Season 1","I am going to keep this short and sweet. Deep Space Nine and Voyager are the best.Well can't forget about Star Trek TOS, but I think anybody would enjoy it.Deep Space Nine has everything that a Star Trek needs."
5,Syar Trex Deep Space Nine,I really have enjoyed going back and watching it. The disk are in real good shape.The service was real good and I received the dvd when I was suspose to.I would reconmend amazon to everyone.
3,"six of one, half dozen of the other","This box set is a mixed bag. The actual shows themselves are quite good for a first season of a Star Trek show, much stronger and better written than The Next Generations first season. However, the video quality was a disappointment. Apparently Paramount didn't bother to digitally restore and remaster the shows, they just slapped them on DVD and put a mediocre 5.1 sound mix with them to sucker Trek fans into paying the original $130 (approximately)price. The new lower price for this set is more appropriate, but if you are looking for a pristine digital presentation of this show you should wait for the High Def release which is probably only a few years away."
5,Best Star Trek Spin-Off,"I loved this show when I watched it in the '90's, and now seeing it again is reminding me of how good it was. It's my favorite ST spin-off. I only wish the DVDs were not so expensive, or at least re-mastered so the quality would be better. That would justify the high price. Guess I'll just have to be satisfied with streaming."
4,Lwaxana + Odo sittin' in a tree!,"Thank you Majel! I Love Lwaxana Troi episodes. Her character has always brought much comedy and continuity to the Star Trek (next gen) universe. This is the first of 3 awesome appearances by the Betazoid Ambassador aboard Deep Space Nine. We get solid action, good story, and plenty of comedy. There's also a good mystery. Watch this episode if you like Star Trek. 4.2/5 Stars. Keep On Trekkin'!"
3,"Stars slow, ends with a bang","Babel is another good science fiction story that unfortunately doesn't have anything to do with the overall series story arc. But, it's still pretty good sci-fi, once you get past the dreadfully long first half. I'd watch it again in the future if I had to watch Every ST:DS9 episode (which sometimes happens), but I'd fast forward through the first half. That said, the second half is great. It's like your favorite sports team, where the team ""woke up"" after halftime to make a good game and win. You forget all about the first half. There's comedy, Quark!, Explosions, alien viruses, and everybody's life is in danger. But like a good sports game with a dreadful first half, it's not one you'd want to watch all of over and over. 3.3/5 just because of the 2nd half. Keep On Trekkin!"
1,Painful,"I would agree with other reviews that this was extremely painful to watch and nearly turned me off to watching any further episodes. There was absolutely no point to this episode. Even the ""aliens"" from Gamma quadrant were obnoxious... they looked like they didn't have enough money for the episode so they just painted some symbols on people's forehead and said they were now aliens.If you care about your sanity, skip this episode."
5,Lots of Fun!,Had no idea this series was so much fun! I would have watched when it was on TV had I known!
5,THE NEXT FRONTIER TO CONQUER IS HERE,"The often overlooked ""middle-child"" of the legacy that is the STAR TREK universe is about to take it's rightful place as the most significant and vital of all the STAR TREK series. Already, in it's first season DS9 features some ""stand out"" episodes which exceed some of the expectations of any television fan -- especially a die-hard STAR TREK fan.Sit back and take a journey that may have otherwise been lost on the airwaves, but will prove to have an entire new life in DVD format!"
4,FIN-ALLY! Terrok Nor has COME BACK to our homes!,"Sure, Dwayne might get mad about my abuse of his line, but we live with danger every day, don't we?DS9, the strongest of all the Treks, comes out on DVD, in a full season offer. How do you beat that? Well, bring out the rest of the seasons in short order, I say. Still and all, a welcome thing. Thank you, Powers That Be, for finally getting the clue. It only took you... how many years?"
4,There's a Reason Bill Evans Chose Eddie Gomez,"Anyone who loves acoustic bass in a jazz context will adore this album. Great standards played with rhythmic and harmonic flair that only the best of the best can muster. Eddie Gomez is certainly in that select group. Of special interest are Eddie's wonderful versions of Nardis and Footprints on this CD. Not everything Eddie recorded as a leader is stellar, but this one is certainly is."
4,A logical progression of the genre,I love this album It's more catchy than songs for the withering and it still reminds many of katatonia's brave murder day...Behemoth this group isn't =) this is melodic death metal at it's finest. Though not as dark as SFTW it's still very somber and depressing just no where near the groups first album Futile it's logical progression for this band and they should keep up the good work .
4,Great Tool,"I have been searching hard for a book that contains listings of all the pharmaceutical companies. I've bought a few, and found a few in the library, but this book has the best section about companies that i've found. It's also nice because not only does this book list the companies addresses and stuff, it lists all the medications that they sell. It's been a big help when i've had to research. I recommend this book if you are lost and looking for good company information. If you give this company your e-mail address, they send you a monthly update. It's pretty cool."
2,Just Lists-No Real Help,"This book contains numerous lists of information that is easily found on the Internet. Unfortunately, this information will not help you gain a position. Other than a list of recruiters, there is no information to help you gain and pass the pharmaceutical interviews. There are other much better books on the market to help you gain a pharmaceutical sales position. I purchased four books and this was the least useful one. The best book was Jane Williams' ""Insider's Guide to the World of Pharmaceutical Sales"". I gained a position within four weeks of reading Jane's book and following the instructions!The second best book was Anne Clayton's ""Insight Into Pharmaceutical Sales"". Insight contains some good information also."
5,Not a Book...more like a resource,"I wouldn't call this a ""book"" or a ""guide"". It is much more like a resource. If you are looking for pure information on drug companies, drugs and recruiters, this is the place to get it. It was also helpful to read how to understand the technical jargon from a drugs fine print. very helpful..."
3,"Lots of list, have never received an update as promised","Lots of list of companies and recruiters but extra light on information for obtaining a position in the industry. Tips on selling a product when your in pharmaceutical sales, but fails to address how to obtain interviews other than using recruiter list (which list no contacts of individuals)."
2,Remember it from childhood.,"I remember when I was very young, like before 5, in the 60's and this movie would come on late night on a Saturday night on the ""Fright Night"" program. I never could remember getting pass the ""push the red button"" scene before falling asleep.This movie was one of those types that were use to showcase a new talent. Much like the blob was used for Steve McQueen. But in the Crawling Hand, the ""new"" had no talent. Roger Coleman should have directed this movie. It would have been funnier.But if you are a fan of Kent Taylor, His performance is good.And also you have Alan Hale Jr., the ""Skipper"" of Gilligan's fame."
2,gets far but not really,"bads: needs more action, esp. at start-they could've shown the alien in space gettin dude and scene of hand goin to ocean-u know, action. the skipper makes the film and other scene actor/s. the ending was the best-2 catfishes fightin over da hand, new orleans tyle-whatever. drag that live in lady after film start got choked-thats mean! the possessed dude was too mean, yellin at his goylefriend so bad."
5,Sublime Singing,"John Rutter's Cambridge Singers have released a CD for a recording previously available as an audio cassette. It is a masterful compilation of sacred texts suitable for morning and evening prayer from the Liturgy of the Hours. As every new day dawns with the promise of new life and resurrection, Easter texts prevail in the morning prayer or lauds section. The musicianship is of a high order and the clarity of the polyphonic motets is a pleasure to hear. If you like chant and sacred Renaissance motets and want to delve into the spiritual realms through choral works, this CD is a fine choice."
5,An inspiring performance,"This is one of the best recordings of the Cambridge Singers. We have here a program dedicated to sacred music related to morning and evening, specially music written for Easter and Compline. The repertoire is mostly from the medieval and renaissance periods. The result is a performance of great musicality and peaceful atmosphere. The program selected flows with great unity, almost like it were one single work instead of a collage of different composers. Among the higlights are the opening number, ALLELUIA- HAEC DIES, Dum Transisset Sabbatum, and the beautiful transition between INTO THY HANDS, LORD and UBI CARITAS by Duruflé. This last piece, a favorite of so many choral groups, is performed superbly, sounding fresh and new. As always, the Cambridge Singers, under the direction of John Rutter, have a stunning sound and balance. A great recording for lovers of sacred music and everyone interested in spirituality."
4,Cambridge Singers = Quality,"I do love this cd, but tend to play certain tracks as my first love is chant. I play the Victimae Paschali Laudes in the car and sing along - it is so very beautiful that this rendition of this Easter Chant is worth purchasing this cd alone. I love that one track so much, my only criticism of the cd is that I wish they'd centered the entire cd on chant - and I hope they will do one like that in the future because the quality of the voices is stunning."
4,Brother Sun Sister Moon,"Contemplative music for self-Reflection,inner-reflection and peace. A chance to be alone with one's inner self and no others. Not mood music,akin to ""bubbling brooks"" with classical music intertwined. Gregorian arias with angelic voices to sooth the soul of mankind."
4,fun toy,"my 5 year old and 19 month old love this toy. it has cute music and learning stuff on it, very colorful. it is worth it."
5,Grandaughter loves it.,"My 9 month old granddaughter is so taken with this toy. She patiently sits and moves the shift and turns the steering wheel as if she were actually driving! I don't think the manufacturer thought little girls would be playing with this as one comment recorded when they shift is ""slow down little fellow"". I think it should say ""little one"", not little fellow!"
2,Little girl only played with twice,I got this for my little girl on her second Christmas. She played with it Christmas day and once in her room. The balls are hard for her to put in the hole at the top. She just started placing them on the slide (not through the top). She never used the panio keys and could not turn the wheel. Not much fun.
3,Don't pay more than 30 for this toy,"I picked up this toy for less than half the price two years ago. Why now is it so expensive? No idea. Don't pay more that $30 for it! My daughter loves the little balls, in fact thats about all she plays with. The music is cute for about the first five minutes and now everytime I hear it I almost trip over my own two feet running to shut the darn thing off. She never really did ""play"" with it. Maybe rolled the ball a couple of times down the chute, but even that was a stretch since the balls have to be punched through the hole at the top and sometimes that can be a bit of a challenge. The toy is definitely durable, considering there are days you will wish it was broken. It's a toss-up. My ""high"" rating is for the durability and the balls. What kid doesn't like balls right?"
3,Obnoxious!!,"This toy is super obnoxious!! My son loves putting the balls in it and on the ferris wheel. The sounds on it are very tinny and mechanical and really grate on your nerves after a very short while (and I'm pretty tolerant of noisy toys). There is no volume switch. Also, the buttons don't seem to really connect to what the sounds are. The buttons just spit out very random things no matter what the setting is. This was rather annoying as it is hard for a child to learn concepts and cause and effect when there appears no rythme or reason for what it is saying. I have been very disappointed by most v-tech toys."
2,Poorly Manufactured,"None of the features on this toy worked. I emailed VTech, they directed me to take out the batteries, move the on/off switch back and forth 40 times. After that, everything worked except the ferris wheel, it will not turn. I called the 800 number and they will fix it if I send them $14 (plus the shipping cost I have to pay to ship it to them) - not worth it. After searching this product online, seems like a lot of people have had the same issues. It was obviously poorly manufactured and I am not sinking any additional money into this toy. Very surprised that VTech would not stand behind this product."
5,Good book!,"I felt this was a very good book, providing what I considered to be a balanced approach to the history of Blacks within the United States. I would definitely recommend this for college courses."
5,if it was bad id have already sent it back.....,its what was required for class... the book is perfectly fine... no problems... if so i would have sent it back and written an angry review. :)
3,Typical,"My mom always had a similar grater in the house when I was growing up, so really have not used other styles much except for one of the cheap flat types with a plastic frame that I probably bought in a dollar store. This one works as well as but no better than similar ones I have used. It does the job well but is rather hard to clean without occasionally scraping a finger. I expect it will last a decade or so with my infrequent use. I bought it on Amazon because I was living overseas and could not find one locally. Since returning to the USA, i have seen ones that looked identical in stores for about $5."
5,Progressive International Deluxe Grater,"Super fast service! Grater is very sturdy. I wanted one that was all metal so I could boil it in water if necessary. It is for grating soap into medium flakes. It does not sag under the pressure, is sharp and the handle is well attached. I recommend it for cheddars and swiss cheeses, too as they have a similar texture."
3,SHOULD HAVE A WIDE SLIVER SIDE,"This is a good Stainless Steel grater. I should have read the description more carefully. It does NOT have a side to make wide slivers. I now bought the Trudeau 0991100 4-Sided Cheese Grater, which has that option. If you don't need to make wide slivers, this is ok, but if you do, go with the Trudeau 0991100 4-Sided Cheese Grater."
5,durable and versatile,"We love it! The cutting edges are sharp enough without slicing your fingers if you get too close. With just the right amount of downward pressure, it remains stable. It also rinses clean in the dishwasher."
2,Cheap,Made of a very cheap metal which bent the first time I used it. I thought it would be good but needs to go back.
4,We Love Life,"We Love Life being Pulp's 2001 and their 7th studio album and contained the singles ""Sunrise / The Trees"" (double A-sided) and ""Bad Cover Version"". The booklet is quite plain and that is good. The cover is only the name of the band and the title. The lyrics are easy to read and we get a nice list at the end of whom plays what on the album. Being that this is their last recorded album to date the sign that one of the band members holds (which says ""bye"") is quite witty. 4/5."
3,Don't buy UK version.,"Dear Pulp fan... -- and that's what you must be to be willing to buy this. Otherwise, Pulp's 3 preceding albums are considerably better: ""His ""n Hers"" (1994), ""Different Class"" (the one with ""Common People"", 1995), and their best, ""This Is Hardcore"" (1998).Anyway! Dear Pulp fan, I seriously advise you to not buy this British import, since the songs are exactly the same as on the rest of the world (including Canada) version. If you desperately want the original, green leaves cover, since the rest-of-the-world has an autumn, multicolored-leaves cover, then I'd advise you buy the US import. The US import is not only cheaper, but has 2, albeit below average, bonus tracks found as b-sides on ""Bad Cover Version"". While they don't constitute a proper ending to the album, and sound under-developed, HEY they're extra tracks. So there's no reason to buy the UK version; the US version has the same cover and 2 bonus tracks."
4,What exactly do you do for an encore?,"Having gone to the trouble of buying _We Love Life_ as an import, I am delighted by the result. You have all that you love in Pulp: the catchy and lovely melodies, Jarvis's unexpected lyrics, the whole way in which anything the band addresses seems to be a _twist_ on the subject. What's new here is a sort of lightness, not universal on the album, but a large part of its appeal. Like ""Help the Aged,"" which shocked me simply by being absolutely sincere, ""I Love Life"" is not an ironic song. It's jaded but hopeful. Jarvis seems to be at his most generous on this album, not only the stud you want to be, but a guy you'd like to hang with. I won't bore you with a list of the delights all over the album, but I can assure you, whatever you spend on it, it's worth it, worth it, worth it."
5,Deceptively Pastoral,"I disliked 'We Love Life' the first time I listened to the album. I missed the old Pulp. I really hated ""The Trees."" The album was relegated to collecting dust. On a whim, I popped the album in a few months later and was blown away. We Love Life is a sublime listening experience - and easily worth 5 stars (and not many albums are...). Jarvis's lyrics are subtle and just as clever as before - but you have to listen. The high point of the album is the spralling and beautiful ""Wickerman."" This album is the best of 2001 and 2002. Treat yourself to what may be the last Pulp album."
4,not easy listening,"though this is the first album that i've ever bought by pulp im must say that i was quite impressed. i remember listening to ""disco 2000"" and ""this is hardcore"" and i was expecting something like that, but didnt get it. i had to listen to the album like 5 times and after that i just couldnt stop listening to it.my fav song was ""Bob Lind (the only way is down)"", i guess that anyone that's not into pulp should like that song. the other standout track has to be ""Wickerman"" that lasts over 8 minutes. the album is great and if you like pul you'll probably like it."
2,a disappointment,"Thought 'Common People' was a fantastic record, loved the less consistent 'This is Hardore' for its outstanding songs (which were truly outstanding), and kept up w/ the band news so that I could pounce when the next release arrived...Then it arrived.No point going on at great length. It's a boring record, with few memorable songs, little evident energy from the band, and slick production that seems to have bled the life out of all involved.If you don't own the earlier records, buy them; you won't be disappointed. If you do own the prior records, dust them off, give them a listen, and pray that teh follow-up to 'We Love Life' is a return to form."
3,its no Hardcore or Common People(or whatever thats called),I was disappointed. I couldn't even be bothered to listen to the whole thing. I loved Harcore and Common People(title?).
4,"""Roots""","We Love Life is Pulp's ""roots"" record. If you think that's a contradiction for a band that's made a career on bitter irony, you'd be right. Partially a result of a new guitarist, partly from the bad reception of their last release, This Is Hardcare, Pulp strips down and takes stock: in the English countryside, the solace you can find there (""The Birds in Your Garden""), the scant consolation of the natural order (""Sunrise""). Before you accuse Jarvis Cocker of wearing blinders though, consider that this incisive observer also finds immense decay (""Weeds""), carnage (""The Night that Minnie Riperton Died""), insignificance (""The Trees""), and the sharpest melancholy they've ever limned (""Roadkill""). In other words, with We Love Life, Pulp finds balance, the equilibrium that has eluded them until now. One caveat: next time, guys, keep the spoken recitative to a minimum."
3,Picture does not match,"Important to mention that picture placed is not accurate since the product received is the one with Three-slot design, dual-position or strong-side carry. Not too bad, but I miss the old version with only two belt loops, which by the way was the one I thought I was buying. Finally, I have to say that once in your belt, it bends to shape the gun and becomes bulky so part of the concealment porpoise is gone. NOT VERY HAPPY with my purchase considering I went for what I saw in the picture."
2,Boring twits...,"Generally I enjoy books by Julianne MacLean, but I couldn't stand the characters in this book. The ""hero"" has anger issues and was just generally an idiot. This will sound odd, but whenever I dislike the hero, I always imagine him with a beard. And in my imagination, Magnus had quite the beard. The heroine isn't much better. Another clueless idiot who lacks both common sense and dignity. Just boring, dumb characters. I enjoyed seeing Lily and Whitby again, but that's about it."
2,Acutally more like 1 and 1/2 Stars,"I read the book prior to this one, which the ""hero"" in this book played the villain. In that book to me he was so unredeemable and unsympathetic that I was a little leary of reading this one. How is she going to make him sympathetic, how will he right the wrong he did to the heroine? Which to me was never addressed and a 'good' explanation or apology given To me she just was poor me, I was lied to and taken advantage of, yes, it was her first love. But aren't all first love's painful? She should have moved on and at least have been courted by another man and he should have stayed in America. He was no better, first obstacle, he went off in huff, well that should tell you how he would handle any obstacle in life. I'll have to wait and see the next book from this author."
3,Maclean can do better,"I have read a good amount of Julianne Maclean's books and have liked them all. I had been looking forward to reading Annabelle's and Magnus's story and I was a bit disappointed with it when I finally got to read it. I felt that Anabelle was way too wishywashy and towards the end Magnus was the same way. The story never seemed to flesh itself out and the appearances of Whitby and Lily, from Love Accorrding to Lily which I enjoyed, just felt like they were a bit thrown in sometimes.The book seemed to be mainly about how Annabelle was confused and could't really deal with what was happening. She does redeem herself later in the book for her indecisiveness. Mostly I didn't enjoy the book because I like a stronger willed heroine. If you want to read a book about lots of inner turmoil this would be a good read for that."
4,"Unique plot, excellent characters","This is the second Julianne MacLean book I've read (the first was ""Love According to Lily"") and after this one I definitely plan to buy her earlier books! This book had such a unique story, and I always like that. Annabelle and Magnus had a lot of BAD past history to overcome to end up together and the path wasn't easy, but now we really believe that they can end up happily ever after. They've faced the real issues of their past and worked through them, and after dealing with that, they can work through anything in the future.Ms. MacLean did an excellent job of conveying the heartache and pain that both characters felt, as well as the pull of attraction between them. In addition, the characters had depth that truly brought them to life in the pages.I also liked that this story took place in the late 1800s and we could see the fantastic new innovation of electricity - a nice touch."
2,Rings on Chains Only,"This item has keyrings on chains. I didn't like it because it does not have the conventional several keyholder thingies (that's the technical term) inside, however if you like this style it appears to be good quality."
4,Classy and nice! A bit small for today's massive keys for cars.,Wonderful quality! Great value. Two key rings/chains is a bit skimpy. Would have liked one or two more. Size is a bit small considering today's car key size. Would recommend for anyone with only one car key.
3,Nice but not what I need,"Nice leather, but zip tag broke on second use and it doesn't fit my car keys. The idea was better than the reality. I imagine this would be perfect for someone who has just a few keys. Sadly, that isn't me. I'm still after a really good key-carrying solution for someone who has big bulky keys."
2,Zipper broke,"I bought this a while back as an alternative to the usual key cases with flimsy key hooks. Seemed like a good concept, but as someone else has mentioned, the zipper is not the greatest. It broke not long after I started using it. I continue to use it without the zipper, but am still searching for something more secure."
4,Nice workmanship and a very good idea.,"In the past I've used the more traditional key cases, but the hooks eventually fall out and getting them back in is difficult and never last for long aftwards anyway. I think this will prove to be a better longer lasting solution. Bigger keys and remotes did not fit in the old style cases very well. This one fits all of my keys easily. I guess the only complaint I have is that the chains are a bit long, but I could cut them down to a shorter length if I wanted to."
2,"Looks nice, poorly made",The belt looks nice but I actually broke one of the snaps on the inside pulling the label off of it immediately after I opened the box. If you want a quality belt that's going to last this is not the one.
