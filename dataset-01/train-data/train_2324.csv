5,Awesome!,This shaver was a Father's Day gift for my husband. He absolutely loves it! He said it is the best shaver he has ever used. It leaves his face very smooth and it causes no irritation to the skin. And he loves the ease of the daily cleaning.
5,Braun Series 5 8995 Men's Shaver,"I have found the braun Series 5 8995 Men's Shaver to be the best electric shaver I have ever used, far superior to Remington and Norelco. Prior to this purchase I had been using a blade because of dissatisfaction with previous electric shavers. It took about a week to adapt to electric shaving again and I couldn't be happier. I love the cleaning and recharging base. This is a feature no one else offers. It keeps the shaver very clean and automatically maintains optimum battery health. This is, without a doubt, the best electric shaver on the market today.Carl OlsenPuyallup, Washington"
3,compare this razor,I do not see any difference in this razor than My other brawn razor which I had for years ( brawn 7550 ) I realy wanted to see a big improvement but I did not for the price of this item I expected alot better.
1,Waste of Money,"This is worst shaver that I've every owned. The shaver has all these gadgets, probably why it costs so much. Unfortunately, it doesn't deliver as advertised. The shave was never close, no where near as close as my Gillette ""Fusion Power"" razor, and I broke out into a rash after every use. I'll never purchase another electric shaver. What a waste of money."
2,Nice look but does not give a close shave,"I have been using this shaver for a year, and I decided to write a review because I am very disappointed in the performance, it does not give a close shave. I even changed the foil and cutter in the time frame specified but the shave is mediocre.This was my Grundig replacement which I thought was going to be better because all the new features and technologies it had, and also mainly because it self-cleaned, but after a year of use, I really can say that the best feature it has is the self-cleaning base that is why I gave it a 2 star rating, but without the self-cleaning base I would rate it 1-star.I am going back to the Grundig brand"
4,Braun 8995 360 lives up to claims,"First, I have never owned any razor other than a Braun. So, for 21 years, I have used Braun. It definetly cuts better, for me, than the Norelcos. This Braun is just a slight bit better than the best they had previously. Also, it does take longer for the cleaning cycle than my previous Braun. Overall, though, I am still a believer in Braun shavers."
5,Excellent price and service.,Bought after comparing several other stores and site. Amazon offered both the best price and service.
1,Expensive and not worth it!!!,"I bought this electric razor because I read a lot of good reviews about it, and now that I own it, I know I have wasted my money. I was tired of using regular razors and wanted to give it a try to electric models. It left my skin very irritated, the manual instructed me to use it for at least two weeks so my skin could get use to it, but even after that period my skin still gets irritated. Now am using the old razors and that works better for me."
3,A little too hyped up,"I've used Braun electric razors since college - my dad bought his first one when I was a kid. My second Braun 6520 had reached the end of its life a few months ago, replaced the foil and cutter but the battery was depleted and wouldn't hold any charges. After reading some mixed reviews, and seeing the $50 coupon I decided to purchase this. After letting it fully charge, I found that the shave wasn't really worth the $150 cost. I did get a decent shave, but nothing better than my 6520 from 4 years ago (which I also bought from Amazon for a mere $59.88). I don't clean it with every shave as I've heard this would shorten the life of the 'clean and renew' refills (they are pretty expensive). Battery charges don't feel to last too long either. Daily shaves only take 3:21 mins to complete (has a timer on it). The cleaning process is pretty loud and one way to preserve the fluid is to remove the refills and close them tightly. Again, the 8995 is over priced and over rated."
4,Braun 8995 Shaver,This shaver has met all my expectations. It cleans and recharges itself automatically. The shave is close and nick free. The only slight negative is the cleaning time per shave could run to 20 minutes.
1,THE WORST!,This is absolutely THE WORST shaver I've had in quite a while. I paid a premium price for it and it never saved decently from the beginning. I had to go over and over several spots and I would still find hairs sticking out when i was done. I went back to my used and much less expensive Norelcos and they still did a better job than this razor when it was new.Recently purchased the Panasonic ES8249 and couldn't be happier. Finally! A razor that actually does the job and with no fuss. Don't mess with the Braun! Go for the Panasonic!
1,Not Worth the Money,I purchased two of these approximately year ago one for house and one for corporate apartment. Less then 4 months starting having problems with getting them to make contact in the cleaning charging station. I used wide range of items to try to hold the shaver in place; and now nothing works. They are not worth the money; plus you have to continue buy the cleaning solution. Not long after I started having the problems with Brauns I purchased a Panasonic wet dry shaver for travel purposes. I actually used the Panasonic more than the Brauns; it shaves cleaner closer and definitely a lot easier to clean and you don't have to buy any cleaning solution-had zero problems with it.
5,Braun Series 8995,My previous Braun was the 7000 series that served me very well for years. I have always been partial to Braun and have never regretted it.My new 8995 shaver is everything I expected it to be and then some.My son has a Norelco and is always using the Braun. I wonder why!!!I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone in the market for an electric shaver.
2,The 590cc is not the 8995!!!,"This item is the series 5 590cc not the 8995. The 8995 is a completely different than the 590cc. 590cc is a smaller shaver. Not very happy that they didn't fix my problem, twice in a row."
4,Braun,"Excellent shaver for thick and thin growing hairs. I am very happy with my purchase, and would reccomend to others."
4,What About the Neck?,"Works great on face, but Im still using my Schick on my neck. This is absolutely useless on the neck. It is great for guys with sensitive skin, and those with problems with ingrown hairs. I've had it 4 months, and only one ingrown hair. Worth the money if you deal with shaving your neck by other means."
3,Its ok...,"For some reason, I can't get this shaver to do a clean shave on my neck. It simply can't follow the curves of a neck very well. It does a great job on my face however. I continued to try it for about 3 months, and still couldn't get a clean shave on my neck, and when I came close, I had to run it over my neck so many times that it causd irritation. Guess I'll go back to my old shaver and just replace the foils.The cleaning fluid seems like a gimmick. I never needed it before..."
4,Great shaver,I have used this shaver about 15 times so far. It works great. My hair is thick and hard to cut. This shaver cuts 95% which is fantastic for me. I follow through with a regular razor and my shave is excellent. This is by far the best electric shaver I have ever purchased. So other shaver has cut this close.
4,Feels Like a Great Electric Shaver,"I have only owned this shaver for a month, but I like how it feels against my skin. It gives me a close shave on most of my face, but it leaves some stubble along my lower jaw line. I believe I can live with that, but I did pay over $150 for this shaver. Come on Braun, you can do better (or is it the Gillette blades??). I am also hoping that my face will get use to the Braun and maybe solve that problem."
4,Better than any kind of razor for my face,"I have had chronic razor burn and ingrown hairs since I began shaving many years ago. When I first began shaving, I used a rotary electric shaver that tore up my face, so I switched to blades. I used all the fancy three blade systems. More recently, I tried the straight edge Merkur razors. The straight edge were the best to date on my face (and the closest shave). However, the razor burn and ingrown hair persisted. A friend recommended trying a Braun shaver and let me use an old one that he had. I liked it enough that I bought the 8995. I still get an occasional ingrown hair, but this shaver is much easier on my face than a razor, even though I use it daily - whereas my face could only take the razor every two days. I can also shave with all my clothes on. It's not quite as close a shave as the razor, but it's close enough for me."
2,Jury is Still Out,"I have had the razor for about 5 months now and I am still undecided about whether it is a good deal. It does not really provide any closer shave than other models that cost far less. The extra ""holes"" in the screen sounded like a great idea but I haven't really noticed they make a difference in closeness of shave. Also, the screen gets hot pretty quickly and I have irritated the skin on my upper lip several times. I had high hopes for this product but I think my three year old Panasonic did a better job."
4,Great Shaver,"Now that I've used the 8995 for 3 months, I've determined a few things:- Not quite as close as my Remington triple microscreen I have been using for the last 10 years, but close enough- Shaves quicker, with fewer missed hairs than my old Remington- Auto-clean is nice. Saves a little more time- Sometimes a stray long hair escapes the cutters and you have to engage the sideburn trimmer. It's pretty sharp and uncomfortable on your neck, but patience works best. The Remington had a better long hair solution, but then again it allowed more long hairs to escape.Is it worth 2-3 times as much as a top Remington? Maybe, but it's a keeper for me."
1,Not worth the money. Base has defects.,"I bought this for my husband after his rotary electric razor failed after many years. Going from a $30 to a $170 razor raises your expectations however, he says this razor shaves no differently from the cheaper one AND it requires the continual purchase of cleaning solution. In addition, shortly after receiving it the base unit would get stuck in cleaning mode and would run all night. Its bad enough waiting 1/2 hour for the cleaning process to complete but all night? We're not performing surgery with this razor. There's no need for cleaning solution after every use. The other razor worked just as well just shaking it out, and didn't suck electricity 24/7. Amazon wont let you send it back so we had to mail it, at our cost, to the manufacturer for a refund. Have not received it yet."
3,"Nice, not great and expensive","In 1973 I received a Remington Micro Screen shaver as a gift. I have used it for 34 years. The A.C. cord failed. I decided to get the Braun 8995 to replace the thing. The Braun is much nicer in the hand, quieter, and cleans itself. Screens and cutters are easy to find. I found an A.C. cord for the Remginton and got it running. Here's the deal. If I first shave with the Braun then go over with the Remington, I can feel and hear the cutters getting more beard. The shave is closer. If I first shave with the Remington the Braun gets nothing more, though the foil design is better and catching curly hair."
1,POOR QUALITY CONTROL,"I purchased a Braun 8995 with the automatic cleanser on 7/1/2007. Shortly thereafter, it wouldn't charge. It was repaired on 8/8/08. In less than months it was already beginning to malfunction. Currently (7/28/09), it won't turn off, charge, or clean.For the price I paid ($157.59) I wouldn't recommend it unless the the warrantly would be AT LEAST 2 years. Now (7/29/09) a day later), I learn the repair center is out of business and Amazon won't accept for return the liquid-filled cleaning cartridges."
2,"Greater razor, lousy foil","I really like the 8995 razor, it does a very good job shaving. The problem I have, the foil tends to break every 2-3 months. When I add that expense in, it tends to be very expensive."
5,Great Razor and Self Cleaning!,I've owned most brands and this is the razor to buy!It gives me a great shave and keeps itself clean and ready!What else do you need?
2,Not for the heavy bearded,I don't recommend this product for men with heavy facial hair. This unit tends to leave a lot of unshaved patches after a thorough use. It will not get a close shave either. It's good in a pinch when you're short on time and have to shave on the go. Men with a light beards should have no problem with this shaver.
2,Braun 8995 360 complete Shaver,Used the Braun Shaver 8995 and did not like it. Sent it back after 5 days because it kept Shutting off and did not charge right in the clean and renew system. Had to use to much pressure on the face to get a close shave causing Razor Burn especially on the neck. Also they say to clean Renew it everyday which is ridiculous and will hurt the battery without letting it run down low before charging.Norelco suggest's to rinse clean every day under faucet and use the jet clean system every 2/3 weeks when the battery is at it's lowest so as to get the best perfomance out of the Battery.I always used Norelco rotary shaver 5865 and now ordered out the New Norelco 9170XLCC and can not beleive the closeness of the shave without so much pressure on the your face.
1,Not worth the price,"This is my second submission. Amazon did not publish my previous one. First problem, you MUST shave BEFORE you wash/shower your face! Does that mean I must change my way of life? Second, the flexing head proved much of a problem since is slipped and jumped over my skin. In the ""fixed"" mode the shave was never as close as my Norelco 8138XL about a third of the price. I needed to go over and over the facial area, pressing lightly and then firmly trying to cut the hairs but the result was unsatisfactory. I wish I can return this to Amazon for a credit against any other purchase.Please publish this now."
4,very good overall,"It was rough the first couple of times. After a couple of weeks, I got used to it. Not exactly the result of a blade but close enough with much greater convenience and shorter time to shave. May need to shave everyday instead of each other day with a blade."
4,electric shaver,"works good, cuts close. if you wait for your facial hair to grow long, it still cuts it, but it also pulls."
5,Fun product,"I never thought shaving could be fun but this is a great product to use. It gives a nice shave, is comfortable to use. When you hold the shaver in your hand you can just feel that you have a well-designed piece of machinery. It is great at catching longer hairs that other shavers miss. I especially like the information displays on the shaver and the charging/cleaning unit. The cleaning system works like a charm. They recommend cleaning daily but I do it every second or third day to save money on cleaning supplies. They have a ""quick clean"" mode where you loosen the shaver head and run the motor for a few seconds and the clippings fall out. It just takes a short time and I do this daily. I feel this keeps the clippings out of the cleaning solution and perhaps extends the life of the solution."
4,I Love This Shaver,"I have been using electric shavers for 20 years, and this is the best shaver I have ever owned.I had a lot of problems with shaving due to ingrown hairs and razor burn on my neck. My previous two shavers were Panasonic Linear Shavers (also a great shaver) and before that several Norelcos (even had the Norelco with the lotion that used to spurt out - it was pretty gross). I decided to try a Braun, because the Panasonic was not shaving close enough and I still got minor razor burn on my neck.The shave I get is incredibly close and there is NO razor burn AT ALL. The only drawbacks are (i) it's difficult to clean without the solution, (ii) I still find clippings after I take it out of the solution, and (iii) it's not wet/dry (one of the most attractive features of the Panasonic).All in all - I'm very happy about the switch and highly recommend this shaver."
2,Not for me.,"This appears to be a high quality product and I am not writing a bad review it just is not for me. I have a very difficult face to shave and over the years despised my Norelco for always eating my face, causing me to break-out on my neck. This does the same in a less effective shave."
3,Greatly OverHyped,"I have never really liked electric razors. I prefer the close shave of a blade. However, upon reading the literature on this shaver I felt that I finally could get as close a shave (well maybe not quite)as a blade. Given the cost of the shaver, I cannot sufficiently express my disappointment. It is no closer in shave as any other shaver I tried years ago at a substantially lessor cost. Yes, the self clearning feature is convenient and nice. But, what good is that if the shaver sits in its cradle and is not used because it doesnt live up to the hype and the blade is still best. If you really prefer an electric razor there are alot of cheaper alternatives that will give you just as close a shave. Dont waste you money on this product like I did!!!!"
4,Braun 360,"I've been quite impressed with the Braun 360. I've use Norelco previously. The cleaning unit while somewhat gimmicky works quite well. I have a tough beard and have been impressed with the closeness of the shave. To get a good shave it does take about 6 minutes but leaves my face feeling smooth and not irritated. I prefer not use any pre-shave and just shave dry. The shaver works as well as my old Norelco but feels of higher quality and workmanship. I've ordered for a long time from Amazon and this order like others arrived on time and error free. The reason for 4 stars and not five, is that this electric like others does not get as close as a blade but it's approaching it and certainly it's nice not to have to use a septic pencil. I'd recommend to others who are looking for an alternative to blade shaving."
5,Love it,"This is the first electric I've owned that makes me not want to use a blade much. If it doesn't shave as close as a blade, it's damn close, plus it's fast, takes me less than 2 min for a shave. Even does a good job on my neck. Battery life is good and the cleaning function works great. I only clean and charge about every 10-15 shaves though, I just remove the foil and tap it a few times or brush it after each shave. I previously had a Braun 7000 series, and this unit is superior, it's better at getting longer hairs and seems a bit closer."
3,Good shaver,"I found it to be an excellent shaver. Easy handling, with an excellent travel storage box. The cleaning system works grate, keep the shaver clean and your skin does not suffers. I highly recommend it."
4,Nice Shaver,"This is a wonderful shaver right out of the box, did a quick charge and shaved, smooth as any blade, it is really amazing and quick. I do not have a heavy beard unless I don't save for a few days, but after using my Norelco for many years, I wondered WHY I ever waited to get a new one. It is a little noisier than my other, but then it was not near as close as this one is. I would not have the cleaner base in the same room as I was trying to sleep, it works well also and it is really nice to have a nice CLEAN razor to shave with, even smells good!! But, the down side and why only 4 stars, is it too is noisy but well worth it for the clean razor always. Easy to set up and use, and at Amazons price it is a real bargan!!"
4,Got what I paid for!,Product works as advertised. Kind of refreshing to see a company have a product work like it's supposed to.
5,Excellent,"This is my first time using an electric razor. The product is very nice, it comes with a travel case that has a brush, it comes with a cleaning cartridge, the base charger, a power adaptor (that plugs into the charger or directly to the razor).At first, it did give me razer-burn, but that went away after a couple days of use (and im told up to 3 weeks for some people). Cleaning it is super easy. I dont clean it using the full clean like it suggests you always do after every use. Typically i shave once a day so its only small hairs, and i just loosen the guard and turn it on over a trashcan, then blow on it and its perfectly clean.Cleaning with the base is actually pretty loud, so its not something you do at night.Remember: this is a dry razer, dont get it wet!Overall, i love it."
4,Good but Panosonic ES8168 is better.,"I have this Braun and also the Panasonic arc ES8168.The Braun is quite heavy and solid with good battery life and giving a reasonable result in about 3 minutes.I have quite a heavy beard and travel a lot for work so wanted to still feel fresh at the end of a long flight so I tried the Panasonic, it is quite a bit closer and faster too.Compare the reviews of both products then decide."
5,Best shave by far,"This shaver rocks. I hate to shave, I hate razors, especially over priced razors. I have tough hair, every other razor I have ever used could not shave my face close to the skin. They always left hairs and I would have to go over my skin with a razor to clean it up. This shaver, has always given me a perfect shave. I have nothing bad to say about this thing at all. It self cleans itself, which is great. The cleaner tends to dry out quick in the summer, especially if you have no AC. I pour rubbing alcohol into the container to make it last longer. It doesn't hurt as the main component in the fluid is alcohol. I would recommend this one as to the new ones out there, they are much more expensive and I can't see how they could get any better than this one."
1,The Ultimate Indignity,"In the first instance, this razer does not shave all that well. When my old razer died, I bought a $25 dollar Norelco as an emmergency replacement. After upgrading to this...and giving my face time to adjust...and doing several variations of side by side test...I was suprised and dissappointed to see that this razor takes longer and doesnt shave as close as the $25 Norelco, particularly for day to day use. (The Norelco seems to do poorly if days are skipped, as on the weekend, while this doesnt seem to matter as much with the Braun.)While the side-by-side tests might warrant one star alone, consider how you would feel if you tried to use this thing to shave your bald head and 80% of the hair taken from your face immediately dumped on your head. Not a one time thing, it just doesnt hold shavings properly. Even in routine facial use it does leak some shavings, which isnt cool for a razor in this price range.Avoid. Dont get sucked in by the hype."
5,The Best,"I've been using a $120. dollar Phillips/Norelco shaver for about a year and I changed the rotary blades once. My skin was becoming irritated to the point of, hell with shaving I think I will grow a beard. Well to make a long story short I was told by my wife and son that I looked about 10 years older. That was all it took to push me to look for a better shaver. The Braun 360 Complete is like night and day comparing it with rotary shavers. It shaves alot closer in half the time! Plus it cleans itself and tells you (by the LCD)at what time you should put new foils and cutters, ( about 18 months). Absolutely tears up rotary shavers."
5,Back to Braun,"I have been using electric shavers for some time now (over 20 years). My most recent was a top of the line Norelco (the James Bond one). That was an excellent razor, but having recently replaced the heads I was still noticing a not great shave, and I never could get that area under the nose with it. I am not sure if my razor was losing some ""ooomph"" or what. In any case, I went to the local shaver shop and tried this new Braun. I had owned Braun shavers before and was very impressed with this one. It shaves easily and quickly (I am done in under 3 minutes). It is quiet, and the cleaning system is just fantastic. My shaves are getting closer and closer as my face gets reacquainted with a foil (versus Norelco rotary) system - don't be afraid, it was an easy transition. I am getting the easiest and closest shave ever. Bravo Braun!"
3,Good razor,"I really liked the razor, however the hair on my neck grows in odd directions and the razor couldn't pick it up. But on the hair above my jaw the razor was amazing. It took one stroke and my hair was gone and my skin smooth. I wish it worked on my neck, so if ur hair grows in odd directions i dont think this razor is the correct choice for u"
5,Great Shaver,"I thought $157.59 was a lot to pay for a shaver, but I would say it was definitely worth it. Previously, I shaved with a Braun 6520, which wasn't anything special except for its brandname reliability. I cleaned it (by hand) after every use and enjoyed a clean shaver with a closer shave every time I shaved. Now with the 8995, I don't only benefit from not having to clean it by hand, but it smells nice and fresh and lubricated, making each shave feel as if I am shaving with a brand new shaver every time. The Clean&Renew feature is worth the $41 increase over the Braun 8975, which lacks that feature. I have shaved with it about 9 times now and have no regrets."
4,Great product,"This product is awesome after the 3 first shaves, due to machine adjust to the curve of the face, after that is just awesome."
2,Braun still not a Remington,"I went from a Remington to this Braun about 6 months ago. Immediately noticed the clipping blade/mechanism is not as powerful or effective as the Remington's. Now I rarely need to shave every day so it is often the case I will use the clipper to trim it down. With this shaver it was simply not possible and i have anything but a thick beard.I find the shaver is adequate if the hair is standing straight but if you have irregular facial hair at all (growing along skin or flatter) it completely misses the hair, even the clipper does not get it all.Thankfully Walmart takes anything back and i was able to exchange for the Remington Titanium for less than 50% the cost of the 360 and for my face it is twice the shaver."
5,Great Shaver,I love this shaver! I have sensitive skin and most electric razors would pull at my hairs and be very painful. This shaver doesn't pull or hurt at all. I alternate every 2 days with this electric shaver and the blade razor. I must say it's worth every penny. The only difference I see with cleaning it everyday compared to a couple times a week is that the longer you wait to clean it then the more time it requires to clean the shaver.
4,Braun 360 Complete Shaver,"I bought this shaver for my husband for Christmas. He has always been a Braun shaver user and was pleased with the Braun 360. We were a little disappointed that the new line of Braun shavers is not wet/dry because he likes to shave in the shower. My husband is Asian so he has a light beard. The cleaning system with this shaver is great and I think it will last a long time. The manufacturer recommends changing the cleaning solution monthly. But with his light beard, he has used the shaver every day since Christmas and now it is early February and the cleaning solution is still registering as full. The shaver works great and leaves his face nice and smooth. We are both happy with this Braun 360 shaver, too bad it is not wet/dry."
4,Very Good Foil Type Electric Razor,Gives a realively close shave for an electric razor. The only other shave I like that is closer is a safety razor shave.
3,Not worth the price,I thought this would be a great razor but the shave is not good. My old Norelco does a much better and cost a lot less.
3,No Biggie,"After reading a number of reviews, here on Amazon and elsewhere, I thought that Braun 8995 would offer a significantly closer shave than the Norelco 8894XL which I had been using for a number of years. Despite being new, the Braun performance was no closer than the older Norelco. I'm not certain if the ""Clean & Review station"" offers any real benefit. However, I have continued to use the Braun. I have been using the shaver for over 1 month."
4,very good,"I have to rate this 5 stars for closeness, 3 for the autoclean feature4 for noise level. Im not sure how usefull the autoclean really is, I've used other brands of electric razors for years without autoclean with no issues. One caveat, the little cleaning brush they include is NOT for cleaning either the foil nor the cutter, instructions say it will damage them. alot louder than the norelco type razors"
3,Interesting follow up from Into a Desert Place,"The concept of the trip was interesting, but it could have been better if more of his personal experiences was recorded. There is a lot of historical quotes, which may be of interest to some, but it may have been better to have an initial quote for each chapter instead of breaking it up throughout the story."
1,does NOT fit bosch circular saw,"This fence is on Amazon as fitting the Bosch CS-5 saw, but it does NOT. After purchasing and unpacking I realized it is improperly linked with the Bosch CS5. I spoke to the customer rep at Bosch provantage who told me the proper fence is the WD7RIP from Bosch. So I wasted $9 on this rip fence and now I have to buy another one and pay for shipping on top of it. NOT HAPPY! Update: I was pleased that Amazon refunded my money."
2,The Wrong Product,"This may be a fine product, but it is for Skil saws, not Bosch saws. Skil is, I believe, a division of Bosch, so they should know what fits which saw. I finally had to get the correct rip fence for my Bosch saw directly from Bosch."
5,Doctor Who,I love all the Doctors and am glad that I am able to purchase dvd's of the old series.I used to get some of the episodes on public tv on my betta machine! Still have them and machine that works!
5,Great CD,"This Cd is probably the greatest cd I have ever heard in my 16 year life. All the songs have a story. The melodys are great, the harmonica is great. It's Great!"
3,cheaper than plastic,"this gun broke in 2 weeks,because guess where it was made in?China!I was playing Tombstone with my 9 year old brother,i was shooting it & <SNAP!!!!>.Now when you shoot it you have to push the trigger back to the front after every shot......(two months later).my dad took us to Idyll wild Ca,me and my brother took a look at a gift shop.We found some cool guns,my brother got a <LIL OUTLAW HUNTING RIFLE>.I bought a <WESTERN COWBOY LIGHT N`SOUND RIFLE>,that thing broke the next day.See all things from China break.But get the Doc Holliday holster and gun. it will really work. get this,it was made in Spain!! Nick cruz~"
5,Excellent,"I have a ...child who is learning to read English and Spanish. I bought and tried several phonics series (some expensive), and he never got interested in them. But he loves these series (both I and II). He finds the books very amusing, laughs at the stories (very cute!), and like to read them all every time. The phonics structure seems appropriate, yet not as systematic as the other series that he never liked reading. Since my main interest is to keep his passion for reading and expose him at his own rithm to phonetic reading, these two series are just perfect."
5,Best of the Phonics Books,"Of the many phonics books I have read with my son, the Clifford ""Phonics Fun Reading Program"" is the best. He loves the stories and the pictures - both of which are simple but engaging for early readers. Most early reader phonics books struggle to craft engaging stories using the limited vocabularies available to their young audience. Clifford Phonics does so brilliantly.The other big advantage of this series is that is just that - a series. Whereas most phonics programs have one or two sets of books, Clifford has six. The series is graduated in steps of appropriate difficulty, which has kept my son interested and challenged. His reading has progressed remarkably well with the Clifford series. Not quite yet four years of age, he has worked his way up to Level 5 over the course of approximately ten months. I credit a large part of his success to the Clifford Phonics program - the rest, of course, I attribute to my son's enthusiasm."
2,"Shoddily Done, but Entertaining","Though my son likes these books a lot, and reading ANYTHING is helpful for him, I wish someone had proofread them! Several of the books switch tenses over and over, and one book that claims to focus on the ""-ed"" ending does not in fact CONTAIN words with the -ed ending -- someone in the editing process obviously switched everything to the present tense, thereby editing out that which they meant to teach!Lots of other continuity errors and extremely awkward phrasing. You'd think they'd be extra careful with educational books, but these were obviously slapped together by office temps."
2,Off taste,"Too much of a sugar blast and the flavor is a little off. Just my opinion, though. The product was fresh and delivered in a timely fashion."
1,..boring..,"A good friend of mine is a huge fan of deeds and he has all of their albums so i get to listing to them all without buying and im sorry to say but deeds is boring as it gets for me and my friend gets mad when i say that but it's true...Deeds of flesh's"" crown of souls"" is bassicaly the same boring formula these guys have always used and its crap. Skip this one."
4,Great book but....,I ordered the paperback version and was disappointed that pages of photos in the hardcover book (which my friend ordered) were not in the paperback version I ordered. Don' know if that was a defect or not.
4,In the shadow of the Dam: The Aftermath of the Mill River Flood of 1874,"I found the book to very interesting and well written.I was not aware of the event until we visited Williamsburgand Haydenville on our continuing tours of towns and saw thecommemorative plaques.After looking up information online and ordering this book andenjoying it, we would like to return to the area.The book seems to indicate that the dam site is still there afterall these years. Is this true?"
1,"Maybe just my bad luck, but ...","I bought one of these, thinking that it should be good enough that I could pass it on to my kids. Paid extra for it because it was supposed to be a deluxe model. I didn't use it much at all, but had it for over three years. During that time I probably made less than 25 cuts with it--not even enough to scratch the paint on the bottom of the guide deck. I took the thing out to use it the other day and it shot sparks out of the housing and died. Now I have a brand new looking saw that's worthless. I'm not at all impressed with Skil / Bosch at the moment. It's sounding like it's going to cost more to get it repaired than to go out and get a GOOD saw."
4,"Great shoes, great price... interesting scent","These shoes are very nice. Stylish (according to my wife) and comfortable. My feet are very narrow, and thus the shoes are laced up all the way closed, but that is OK!I wear a 14 in most brands, but needed a 15 to fit in these.The only thing... the shoes have been treated with some finishing chemical that has a very strong smell... Not bad, just very industrial metallic grease-smelling... It is still there after 2 weeks..."
1,Yuk - not for the faint of heart,"Bought this for a law and econ class in law school - one that supposedly didn't require an econ background. This book belies that claim. I started reading and spent more time looking up econ terms and phrases than I actually did reading. I'm not sure this book has much value for the average layperson, but perhaps it gets better and clearer after the introduction and first few chapters - I dropped the class and returned the book before I got there. I love Posner's holdings when he writes for the court - but this book was awfully dense."
5,WOW,"This is the best christmas albums i have, and yes, I listen to it all year round!I recomend this cd to all Take 6 fans out there."
2,Where was the music in there?,"This was not as good as I was hoping when I purchased it. I found the arrangements to be so ""busy"" that I couldn't find the familiar piece underneath the busy-ness.It was OK, but I wouldn't rush out and buy it or anything. I felt as if my money would have been better spent elsewhere."
5,excellent birthday music for Jesus Christ's party,"this is one of THE BEST christmas album i've heard to date, and i'm glad to see i'm not alone in saying that i listen to it all year long! their rendition of ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen""...words can not describe how this song moves me. i don't even remember how i got this tape but i'm glad i did. every year when i put up the tree this is the music that really puts me in the spirit (along with Nat, of course), and my whole family just joins in and sings along because now we know all the words. one would be remiss to not include this in their christmas collection."
2,I don't like it,"A full cd made up of songs about death and loss is artistic and ambitious but has a lack of entertainment value.I admire how Lou Reed reduced his feelings to a recording however, for the listener, the dour theme prevents this from qualifying of being ""repeated"" listening.A better work concerning death is Warren Zevon's ""The Wind"". It is very heartwarming but, at the same time, Zevon (always an excellent songwriter) varies the mood rather then making every song so sad and somber.The first 4 songs of this are enjoyable (especially ""Whats Good"") but the rest is so depressing that it becomes quite ponderous."
2,blech,"yeah, i know its about his friends that died. yeah, i know its very heartfelt and sincere, something no one could ever accuse lou of being a few years ago. but shut up! there's not many songs to speak of, and when there is, lou ruins them by his incessant jabbering. i understand that even punks can age gracefully, but honest as it is, it aint too listenable. and i'm not just saying this because he has laurie anderson and i dont."
1,Genius Or Depressing Mess - Take Your Pick,"Magic And Loss is either Lou Reed's best or worst album depending on your taste ,but I can't listen to it. I owned it on cassette, and I'm not exactly sure where it is now. I played it in my car stereo one Sunday on the way to band practice, and found it so depressing, I wanted to throw it out the window, and swore I would NEVER play it again. For any record to bring these feelings from someone makes it almost a work of true creative genius just for that shock value, which Mr. Reed has been good at for all of his career. On the other hand you could say it's so depressing that the entertainment value is nil. Makes Berlin look like a Sunday picnic."
1,Reminiscent of fledgling teenage guitar lessons.,"Lou Reed, and the customers who help him sell, just can't seem to find what they are looking for.I would like the priveleges removed from the person who sent, and therefore subjected me to listening to, this music."
5,The best in Lou's long career,"This is my personal choice for the best album Reed has ever released. I think its something one has to listen to in order to appreciate, not read a review about it. The level of emotional intensity reached hear is extremely rare in popular music.This is not easy listening, especially for anyone who has experienced the untimely loss of a loved one. Every song on this - a true concept album if there ever was one - has a purpose, as Lou takes us through his personal experience of grieving. Most listeners will find much to relate to."
3,Instant Live,I have almost everything this band has done and it is a great selection of songs. The problem I have with it is the guitar is annoying to listen to. The tracks have just too much squealing and scratching from the guitar. I have listened to this just once and probably not again. Layla is one of my all time favorites but as another reviewer stated the scratching guitar is just too much. It's too bad because this could of been an outstanding album.
3,Too much Trucks,"I am sorry to disagree with the other 4 reviewers, but I give this release 3 1/2 stars for the following reason: Derek Trucks' screeching down the fretboard after almost every phrase of his solos, both on slide and fretted strings. It's just too much noise - a very little of this can add excitement if sparsely used, but after almost every musical phrase is way too much - it becomes just annoying noise. That said, otherwise this is a very fine set: well recorded with great sound, fine solos, especially slide, by both guitarists (excepting the above-noted screeching), some delightful new material and old classics. It is a shame that Trucks' lack of discipline in his solos mars so many tracks so badly."
4,A complete guide,"This book is a complete and comprehensive guide to methods of technical analysis. These methods are covered in a concise and sinthetic way (perhaps very sinthetic), so you can't loose any word in the method of your interest. But I love this way. This contrasts with Kaufman's ""Smarter Trading"", a very wordy book that dissapoints me. This is the other side of the coin. Besides this, is the most comprehensive book you can find; if you are looking for a particular method possibly you will found in this book many sound variants of the original you've looking for. The best technical reference I've found, but don't spect too much than a reference."
3,Who needs a summary,You can write a book on each chapter of this book. What you get is a summary and references to other books. Same goes for TS 3 programs which could be better written as user functions.
3,What this books give you,"About ""Divergence using peak Comparisons"". I Quote ""This system is to hard to write"" so he gives pesudo code and stops. Thanks. About ""Charts patteren recognition"" I quote "" the most serious problem... Hold a piece of paper over the right side of the chart..."", this is rediculos, where is TS code."
4,The One,"If you can only buy one book on trading systems OR want to free up space on your bookshelf... buy this book, it's really the only reference you need."
1,Pure Junk!,"Now I have had the opportunity to use many brands of routers andrecently I bought this model to play with.Well after going to a. .. store near work; I went home and unpacked my new and shinny router. I loaded it with a bit and went to work. After about 15 minutes of use, the motor started to fade in and out. So after my second trip to [the store], [this time by my house] I again unpacked my second new and shinny router. This time after 15 minutes of use, the bit kept falling out and again the motor faded in and out. Seems the wrenchless collet did not want to hold any bits. So off again I went to [the store] but this time I bought a Porter Cable #7529. No problems with that one!Now in all fairness if the motor worked properly and if the collet would hold a bit, this would have been a great buy. But instead, after shop testing two of these from different locations, I view this router as a BUST!"
4,Pleased,I didn't read the reviews before purchasing this router and I'm glad I didn't. I looked for the best combination of features and this was it. The quick release does take a bit of muscle behind it to lock into place but I still consider it easier that a wrench. I love the soft start and have had no problems with the motor. I have had the unit about 30 days but have not had any regrets yet.
1,Horrible,"I read the reviews of this router before I bought it. I figured that the reports of dying motors and bad collets wouldn't get the best of me. I was wrong. After about a month and a half I am having huge problems. Cutting in soft pine, which should be no trouble for a router such as this, proved to be impossible for this pathetic machine. The engine faded and then died completely. After a few hours I got it running again, but the same thing happened again and again. This is about this most worthless tool ever, most Skil tools have proven to follow this trend. I am now waiting for a refund check (luckily this happened within the first 90 days) so that I can get a descent router. Take it from me, don't buy this router. I thought that I would save some money but get just a good of a router, doesn't happen. Spend some more money and get a good one, you will save in the end."
2,Quick Collet - Mine was BAD!,This router works great but my Quick Collet went BAD after about 1 hours use. The Bits would work there way out while cutting. I would purchase the model below this one that uses a wrench to tighten the bit in place.
5,Another great album,"Yes some of these songs are on other albums, still, each song brings back a distinct time in my life that the songs on this album bring back to life. But really Amazon..... Peter and Mary Paul????"
1,"Similar to a YOUtube video titled ""Foods That Kill""","I am always looking to learn about nutrition and came across this DVD. She talks about how many animals an individual eats a year and stated if we were meant to eat meat we should be able to attack a cow and eat it. Of course we know the answer to this. A couple of days later I came across a youtube video titled ""foods that Kill"". I could''t believe it. It had the same dialog in many of the sections contain in this DVD including the diagrams as well. Who copied whom? I don't know. So don't waste your money just watch ""foods that kill"". It is the same thing except his face is not as attractive as hers. Furthermore, the youtube video is by a physician and provides extensive information more so than this DVD and its FREE!"
2,I wanted to like this DVD.,This DVD was something that I really wanted to like but just couldn't. The quality is poor and the material in it seems really dated. Save your money on this one.
3,They need a left-handed version,This is just an awesome concept - I bought several of them! My right-handed husband and coworker love theirs. I struggle because it can't be used easily with the left hand.
1,A joke,"It was not missing the handle. We did try to use it, that is how we knew it did not work. The handle is most likely misplaced in your store some where. You misplaced the whole return for over a month. We used it 1 time it was washed immediately after, b/c we knew it would be returned. You are ridiculous. I dont need the money but you guys are shady."
3,Decent,"I received this game for Christmas when it FIRST came out. It is painfully easy in some parts, and unbeatable hard in others. I had played it for months on the cub setting (easiest) and never beat it. Yeah, I suck. It was still fun stomping on the bugs and hyenas, even if I had to do it over and over.There are no real ""random"" parts when you are simba (except for the stampede section). All the other characters move the same set way (until they start attacking you). It gets predictable.If you like the Lion King, then get it. If not, you might want to pass it by."
2,So-So,"We bought this game for Christmas a LONG time ago. I was never fond of this game. Its was very easy, but so easy it was hard. In some levels you have to climb rocks. The characters and landscapes had no depth so it was very hard to jugde how high to jump. If you like games like this, its the game for you."
2,riding only,"im sure these boots would be great if you were to only ride in them and not walk at all. the soles are cheaply glued on, not very good quality leather, the laces on my pair broke within 2 weeks. worst boot ariat has made. all around not satisfied"
3,It had potential,"The book starts off really well. It contains alot of detailed explanation of how things work. But the main problem with this book is that it was not proof read(QAd). The errors weren't huge, but they are really irritating. Instead of focusing on trying out the examples, you focus on getting the example to work. For me, it was just too irritating to follow along. I still use the book as a reference, but for learning purposes, SKIP."
1,Bad Coding in Examples,"It seems to me that the two authors do not have much experience with good coding practices. The examples presented in the book contain useless idioms such as 'new String(""success"")'. A book with the word ""professional"" in the title should try to promote a better style.Also, the way information is presented in the book does not work for me. For instance when talking the authors are building examples after examples and then tell the reader that in practice this approach is unlikely to work. What is wrong with just getting to the point and telling people how to do it right. I have to confess I fell asleep repeatedly while trying to get to the point in the book where the authors may explain how to use tiles appropriately in large projects."
5,YES YES YES,This was if anything BETTER than I expected it's all the original panels and everything with color added but not just color added it's AMAZING the colors capture the rest of the story perfectly all the details simply bring it to life I know thats cheesy to say but there's literally no other way to say it great way to relive this classic story would recommend to ANYONE previous readers and new alike
2,Mediocre manga and a half-assed coloring job,"Fist of the North Star is considered a ""classic"" in the shounen genre and it's an ok read, but there's little more than lame fights (which take up 90% of the content). Even if the cover says ""for mature readers"", the only 'mature' feature is the gore. The storyline and dialogue are just as corny and childish as any other shounen for 12 year-olds, if not more.As about the hyped ""full color presentation"", it is mediocre at best and only ruins the original black & white art. There's the occasional good panel but most of it is just ugly rushed CG. The backgrounds are especially bad.I don't recommend buying this unless you don't get turned off by stupid plot and dialogue, repetitive fights, and would pay the extra cash for a half-assed coloring job."
2,it is not sensitive,it is not sensitive it is all-most the same as build in to alarm box sensor .d d .f f
5,It's shocking!!!,"I installed this in the rear body pan of my 2009 Accord V6 and the one that came with my alarm is epoxied to the firewall. Using 2 shocks sensors I have complete coverage without having to make it so sensitive that it falses. Only the most unruly of Harley's or meanest of V8s set it off. It's a piezo sensor with a chuck of iron suspended by a rubber band with some circuitry for gain and to distinguish pre-alarm from alarm. A great little gadget. I wish that more people would learn to properly install security and not just throw the brain to the alarm under the steering column, crank the gain up on the shock sensor, and call it a day :p"
4,Extra Sensor Made Good Sense-For A Few Dollars And Cents!,"Got this sensor as an add on to a Viper 350 plus alarm sensor. Onboard shock sensor was not quite enuff to cover my Chevy Tahoe. Hook up was fast and easy. Has great sensitivity and covers my whole vehicle, from kicking the front wheel to tapping on rear hatch. would have gave it 5 stars, but it took me a minute to find the right screwdriver to adjust the sensitivity on it... :)"
3,Tami is phenomenal; material could be better,"Tami is a phenomenal singer. I wish she would have sang more songs from musicals that she's been in- Wild Party, Crazy For You, and Guys and Dolls are 3 that come immediately to mind. Some of the pop stuff on the album is a waste of her talent."
1,MISINFORMATION,Again Amazon has reviews that do not match the item: this is a two-disc set which does not contain the films reviewed.
5,Big hit with all ages this past Christmas!,All ages got a big kick out of seeing this movie. Laughter is good.
5,"Positive, colorful introduction to Chinese","I¡m considering Chinese lessons for my 5 & 6 year old sons, and picked up the Follow Jade videos to try and get a feel for what we¡d be in for. In the first half of the summer, my sons (and I) have managed to learn the numbers, fruits, and other basic words. But perhaps most importantly, I feel that the videos have helped to train my ears in preparations for Chinese lessons in the fall.Jade¡s videos are not a Chinese emersion program. If that¡s what you¡re looking for, you should just take your kids to China for the summer. What the videos do, and do very well, is teach kids some basic Chinese while familiarizing them with the correct sounds, all while presenting China in a positive, colorful light"
4,Good for toddler,"I purchased this video for my 2 year old. [...] it could've included a bit more, but I haven't seen anything better out there for young Tots. My daughter loves the ""1,2,3,4,5,6,7 where is my friend"" song. Very catchy. I figured if she learns all the vocabulary introduced, it would've been worth the price."
2,Limited references to later models,"Although the book is advertised as a repair guide for 1991-1997 Ford Explorers, the information for the later models is limited. Few of the drawings and none of the photographs reflect the 1995 through 1997 vehicles. I purchased the book in order to make repairs to my 1996 Explorer, and was truly disappointed with the quality of the instructions in relation to my vehicle."
1,Frustratingly skimpy,"If your serious about maintaining your own Explorer or Ranger, this book will frustrate rather than enlighten you. Not much more informative than the owners manual in the glove compartment. I wound up recycling mine. The diagrams and illustrations are inadequate and the instructions come up short. I you really want to maintain your engine and body you're going to have to spring for an OEM Service Manual."
4,Definitely a starter set,My 4-year old really likes this track and it is perfect for him. It is definitely a starter set. It works well with the Darda cars.
5,Great toy!,"What a great product! We purchased this for my 31/2 year old son. He loves it! No batteries needed and no annoying sounds, just great fun. Easy for him to hook the pieces together. He has spent a lot of time putting the track together, running the car on the track, and then creating a new track design. We couldn't find anything like this in the stores. The tracks in the stores are all bells and whistles and the themes seemed too old for him (skulls, etc). This was well worth the price we paid and we plan to add to our starter speedway for his birthday."
1,Looks nice....broke quickly.,I ordered for a friend who really wanted to carry her computer in it. It worked great for the first month or so then one of the straps broke. She liked the way it looked a lot but very poor construction.
3,"Cute, but not functional","This bag only held my 14"" iBook. Nothing else, like the first poster stated. No cord, nothing. Plus after only a few months of use, one of the black straps came un-sewed from the side. It's *really* cute, but it just was not at all practical if you need to carry a power cable or anything else."
1,weak?,"I am sorry, but I was so excited to have this. But Its not very strong material. I was trying to find a cute bag for my laptop and so on. I was so excited about this bag. When I got it, my laptop fit in there perfectly so I tried to pack up with my laptop charger. I realized that theres no place for laptop chargers. So I personally dont think its worth it. Not the worth the money and time.(UPSET!)"
2,"Super Cute, But......","This laptop bag is super cute, but it only good for light use. On my second trip, I was walking through the airport and noticed that the handle was starting to rip off the body of the case. Too bad..."
1,Won't last long,"This bag is cute and worked well for a while... but after less than a year (and not many uses) both of the leather handles broke off, just as many other reviewers had happen to them. Invest in a more reliable, better desgned bag for your laptop."
2,too small,"I found this laptop carry case good for the mini laptops they have currently on the market, but I'm afraid this one is just too small to fit a normal size laptop in it."
2,My least favorite of the series of 3 August Men books,"Somehow I read book 2 (Sarah's Seduction) first and LOVED it. Then I read Marley's choice which I didn't enjoy as much just because it seemed to hold out and hold out and then boom jumped into it which made it unbelievable. In Heather's Gift, I'm not sure Heather is developed as a character at all - but she went from Virgin to holding a gun to Sam's head and ""raping"" him? I mean, I'm all for changing things up, but when you start laughing at the sex scenes, I think your erotica has taken a wrong turn ..."
5,A FAN FROM NEW YORK,"Lora Leigh continues her series with Heather's Gift-Sam and Heather's story. Sam and Heather come together at a time when a murderer is wanting to harm everything they hold dear. The suspense in this story will keep you captivated. A definite page turner, that will have you finishing it in one sitting.The erotic sex is definitely a plus. Described as ultra hot and equal to an inferno by most of her readers, the erotica will have you squirming for more.The sequel to the August Brother Series, does not disapoint. Visit www.loraleigh.com for more information on the series, and Ultra-Hot excerpts."
2,That's not sexy!!! That's creepy!!!,"think about the premise, it's not only creepy, it's just wrong. The August brothers were sexually abused and victimized as young men and now the only way they can feel complete love from a woman is together. I know, I know it's total backwoods Jerry Springer crap!!! I really don't like books like this. Ones that have a racier theme or kink and wrap it up with a bow and call it ""fufilling"" or ""complete love"". Where I come from having a threesome or foursome with your brothers is just disturbed!!! And the women in story just buy into this warped way of thinking. I don't know about other ladies but if a guy I was dating suggested this; there would be a me shaped hole in the door, and burnt rubber in the driveway!!"
3,"Why, oh why do they have to 'share'?","I'm a big fan of Lora Leigh's work with one big exception - I can't abide it when her hero's just have to share their women for seemingly no good reason apart from to generate a XXX sex scene. I don't mind explicit language, and she's fantastic at creating chemistry and sizzling heat, as well as convincing characters so it really disappoints me to see so many of her male protagonists go down the same, silly path. For me, it wrecks the story."
1,ew,"yeah my title sums it up....just ew. And it has to do with the fact that they are brothers. I have no problems with menage toi, bondage and blah blah blah but I do when they are brothers. Incestuous is the word I am looking for. I am close to my sister but not close enough to be in a threesome with her. I would vomit. So yeah instead of turning me on this series made me physically ill. Lora I love your other books... in fact all of them but you really need to steer clear of stuff like the August brothers. Make them cousins or buddies or freaking strangers having a good ole time just not brothers. God I need to wash my eyeballs......"
2,I Feel Let Down,"I really wanted to know the identity of the stalker and more about how the three brothers got this way. These guys are just too twisted. I'm sorry that my curiosity got the best of me and kept me buying these books because I wouldn't consider this a ""love"" story."
5,Avid Reader From New York,"Award Winning Lora Leigh writes an emotional tale in Heather's Gift. Yes they do share, but there is a story behind that. There is nothing at all incestal about the sharing. For more details on the August series visit wwww.loraleigh.com and for the conclusion of the August brother series titled AUGUST HEAT."
3,Last of the series with a suprise ending,The plot isn't all that strong but the ending is a suprise and theres some good erotic writing. The attempt to rationalize the borthers need to share their woemen is still weak and unconvencing. But over all its a little beter than average for the genra.
5,Look no further for a steamy and amazingly gripping series.,Book 3 and I am soo hooked. This series is extremely steamy and the story line is just soo well done you find yourself pouting when you have to put the books down. So looking forward to the Men of Madison series. Look no further for an amazingly steamy and griping series.
4,Sandra's View,"I have read all of the Men of August books by Lora Leigh and I loved this bookMy favorite in the series was Marly's choice, the first book in the series"
4,wow,I can't believe the book was that good. The story line at so many twist in. I could not put the book down. When the end it blew my mind away to find out what happened at the end.
3,Heather's Gift Book 3 in the series,"This is my least favorite of the series. Heather was not very well fleshed out and we really didn't get to know her before she was crazy in love with Sam. I realize she was supposed to come across as tougher than the other girls, but she just didn't click with me. I also had a problem with Sam in this book. In the previous installments he was fun, and while this book focuses on his troubled past with his brothers, he comes across as way too needy. I like the book overall as a conclusion to the August Brothers series. The sex was great, as Lora Leigh really knows how to write them, but it seems like this was not a well thought out story as a whole. Also, I realize the fantasy of multiple men in a gals bed is hot, but brothers? I think that's kind of wierd."
3,Maybe the third but not the best,"Heather James job is to protect Sam August. Sam doesn't want Heather to protect him, he just wants her. The danger is closing in the August brother's and Heather is finding herself caught in the crossfire. ""Men of August: Heather's Gift"" is the third and final book in the series by Lora Leigh and while I did enjoy this book it just wasn't as good as the first two book. Overall while the series was good Heather's gift could have been better."
4,A decent enough ending,"I'll just admit up front, this series wasn't among my favorites, but this might well have been the best of the lot. FINALLY we get some real insite into what makes the August brothers so confusing to us. I still don't fully understand the compulsion to share, but am finally able to accept it.Sam, the hero, was by far the most compelling of the August brothers. His journey to find some semblance of peace was heartbreaking at times, annoying at others. But it makes him the best of the lot to me.Heather, the heroine, has been the only female in the whole series that makes a serious attempt to get to the bottom of the whole story. And for that reason alone, she's got my vote for favorite heroine.The culmination of the saga of the August brothers was wrapped up well for me, with all three couples as happy as can be expected, given their circumstances."
5,final book in series,read it was great loved the ending. Loved loved loved the book. Before you read this book read the other 2 or you will be lost
2,Not my cup of tea,"I read the first two books and struggled with this one so I skimmed it, I didn't really like the whole idea of the Series.It might appeal to some people but didn't to me, ultimately if you read the first book and like it then read the whole series if not I would recommend not spending anymore money, books were brought already that's why I read them."
5,loved it,I really enjoyed reading the book. I loves reading how the men and women stayed strong and together as a family.
4,Heather's Gift,"Hot and steamy! Loved the three books. Heather was a tad bit annoying, but was a good read none the less."
1,Soooo cheap!,Even at the add-on price this item is way over-priced. Do not pay more than 99 cents for a water globe that leaks and comes in the flimsiest cardbox box possible.
1,Clueless author is more like it,"Why isn't there a ""zero stars"" option?I'm sorry, but this book contains some of the most gawd awful advice I have ever seen dispensed to anyone planning a wedding.Is it supposed to be a joke? If it is, Peter van Dijk missed the mark. Don't even file under Humor - file in the trash."
5,5 out of 5 freemans.,"An excellent dual-use tool: All the standard crowbar uses, but also extremely lightweight, and good for home security - i.e: smashing zombie skulls in a pinch. Titanium construction ensures long-term portability & durability.Also good for dislodging headcrabs, although if they've been attached for more than a minute or two I don't know that it would do much good."""
3,Fancy name,"I admit I got the stiletto bug. the hammers are amazing but this clawbar was not impressed. Had a good chance to use it head to head with vaulgh steel and the steel just felt better and could pull hangers nails from plates with ease.I do like the lighter weight and smaller size for throwing into a emergency tool box, but my primary will be the steel."
5,"expensive, but worth it","$60 for a cat's paw--that's crazy! I've heard it several times, but this thing saves a noticeable amount of weight in my toolbag, and functions well to boot. The dimpler feature is useful, especially when pulling nails from OSB, and the tool just feels and looks great. I have been using mine daily for months, and the head has yet to show any mushrooming like other cat's paws I've owned.Spring for the expensive one: sometimes it's worth it."
5,Stiletto tools still the best!,"Best nail puller I have used to date. The dimpler option might be a bit overrated, but overall the tool is excellent. The biggest problem, the stiletto is so lightweight, I don't notice when my co-workers try and steal it from my toolbag."
2,Snapped in the first week...bad sample? I don't know...,"Guy I work with sprung the $80 bucks for the thing. I was standing next to him while building a wall and he tried to pull a 16d common out with it. Snapped one of the teeth right off. Never seen anything like it. Perhaps it was a bad sample, who knows.dimpler was really cool design feature, though. YMMV. Good luck."
5,Is it really that sharp?,"Another tool I carry all day in my bags, which I don't mind at all. My only gripe is that the claw ends are a little sharp. I know how utterly stupid that sounds, but, scratch yourself with either ends...You will know that you have been scratched!Pulls nails like a regular nail pull, and the weight is incredible! I love this nail pull!aloha,"
2,SEAMY,A disappointment. Each female character is a one dimensional stereotypical caricature. Too many graphic sex scenes drawn from the uglier side of male fantasies. I only finished it to find out if I had correctly guessed the killer's identity.
1,Seemed like a made-for-cable late night movie.,"I really wanted to like this book, but it seemed so ""cut and paste""... you can tell the main character was a psychiatrist because all he had to do was say ""I understand"" and anyone would pour his or her heart out to him. Boring."
1,Yeech!,"The premise of this book is simply described: You've got to be kidding. The only thing less likely than the characters who inhabit this book is the ridiculous ending. Maybe it works for readers who think all psychiatrists are extremely disturbed. Maybe it works for those who know nothing about what psychiatrists do. Maybe it works for those who believe a doctor could show up at an old frined's hospital and ... (I don't want to give away the plot)... I tried. I really did. I tried to allow literary license, but it just got too silly. I ended this book by shaking my head. In fiction it is okay to ask the reader to suspend disbelief a bit... But to expect us to bang our heads against the wall so we don't notice the inanity of the plot? Sorry. Better luck next time."
2,Every character flaw in the world but good at his JOB...,"Is how the author describes our hero. Seriously flawed yet the best at what he does. That might be a whole lot easier to swallow if he weren't a psychiatrist. Up until the half way mark I was able to stomach the unbelievable plot and that's why it got two stars but after that it became ridiculous. Between the flashbacks to an abusive childhood and kinky sex there is a wonder at all that oh yeah he figured out who was murdering everyone. If you want an interesting, plot twisting, all the facts laid out kind of mystery then don't get this one. I have yet to figure out what the title has to do with the book.... maybe it's one of those deep psychological things."
5,Keith Ablow - Denial,I loved this book!! I could not put it down! Great suspense. I can't wait to read the next ones.
4,Hits you between the eyes and keeps your attention,"I found the first few pages gripped my attention and kept me coming back for more. No pussy-footing around the Doctor has you looking for the next page and next piece of action.The Coke sniffing perfessional disturbed me at the start, but he some got himself on the right track.Myself I would have had my way with Kathy and thought about handing her to the cops later. She was some hot babe."
3,Clevenger is a sicko,"I read PSYCHOPATH first, so maybe this is a bit harsh. The problem I have with ABLOW's character, FRANK CLEVENGER, is that he is not a believeable addict. I mean ABLOW just about glamorizes the life of alcohol, cocaine and compulsive sex. The police even harbor some of CLEVENGERS' bad habits, to gain his knowledge into the mind of a serial killer. I was surprised by the ending and finished this book in a few days. The book would be more enjoyable if CLEVENGERS' addiction was not the main topic."
4,King of Denial (and sorry for reworking the pun).,"I only picked this one up because I started reading PSYCHOPATH, but quickly realized that this was probably a series that needed to be read from the first novel. I am amused at the extreme difference in ratings and comments from other reviewers; but just being able to evoke such different reactions suggests that the author is doing something right. Ablow's Frank Clevenger is definitely not a likable character (and he does fall a touch short of Hannibal Lector's admitted sophistication), but at the same time I was fascinated by the story and am certain I will remain along on the ride for any future novels in the series. Also being a fan of Stephen White's Alan Gregory - another detective of the inner workings of the mind - novels, I believe that it will be interesting to compare & contrast the manner in which each character is affected by interacting with their respective 'clients', if that is the word for them."
3,Disturbing read,A good book for those who don't put much stock ib believable charaters. The good Dr is deeper in trouble mentally than the people he's tring to help. Good read for people like me that like to read a few pages every day because the plot is shallow enough not to require review. All in all a fair book. Not a waste of time.
3,Not as good as Psychopath,Here Clevenger spends half of his time talking either about his addiction or about sex.... Ablow tends to forget stuff and replaces important things for Clevenger's weaknesess
4,Absolutely impossible to put down,"What a blast! Just plucked this book from the shelf and couldn't have enjoyed it more. Lots of ideas presented that really make the reader think. Fans of Joe Lansdale would like this - it's not for everyone, but what a wild ride! If you like Jonathan Kellerman (and who couldn't), you'll have to try Denial. Can't wait for the next one!"
4,Intense and fast paced.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I love flawed heroes and in this case flawed is an understatement. It may not be great literature, but sometimes a fun, fast read is what one requires. I certainly wouldn't recommend this for the faint of heart or easily shocked. It would appeal to fans of Joe R. Lansdale."
4,Great reading non-stop!,"Mr. Ablow does a wonderful job at creating a scenario that not only engrosses the reader, butat times can somewhat relate to."
2,"Not as good as - well actually not good, period.","The only description that applies is "" bad Mulligan Stew"". The author apparently decided if he included lots of perversions the reader wouldn't notice the lack of a story. The main character, Frank Clevenger, somehow stumbles through an almost constant drugged blur onto what's going on and takes an absurd course of action that brings a conclusion to a waste of time spent reading this book. I won't dwell on the sex, drugs or gambling which accounts for the bulk of the 358 pages, but instead on the lack of any twisting, turning or surprises, as the ending was predictable and really not much of a mystery at all."
3,Works Ok,I found this new mount to be a little better than the bean bag mount that came with my unit... Also it looks a little better ... Only time will tell when I have to stop quick and it smacks the windshield or rolls off the dash ... I guess I'm still in search of better portable mount for my GPS... Not many options...
4,satisfaction!,I bought this dash mount and my satisfation with my Garmin has increased 100 fold. I was tired and frustrated by my Garmin always falling because the suction mount that comes standard would fail after only about 15 minutes. This dash mount works great. I've even packed it in my luggage to use when I travel and have to rent a car. Pack the Garmin itself in your care-on though!
3,"Works, but Mounting Brackets are not included.","The three-fingered mount works well on the dash, but the Mounting Bracket and Mounting Bracket Adapter are not included. You must already have the other Garmin Auto Mount, part no. 010-10456-00, which does include both of those mounting brackets. (Luckily I had one in the other truck.) And use the screw from the belt clip to attach the mounting bracket adapter to the GPS-60 series."
2,"Okay, but not the best use of this plot","I grabbed this book because I liked the title. However, it was pretty undistinguished as far as romance novels go. I liked the begining with the girl and the young man before they became adults. Piper however, is a bit hard to beleive, never into girly things, but as soon as she tries she masters it, but still a tom-boy. I think she is a little bit too much of everything. Gabe on the other hand is pretty interesting, and I liked his insecurity in his physical apperance, it was really rather refreshing to see a guy worry. (His being from horrible scars from an automobile accident)It just didn't do much for me in the way of plot. Cattle farm in trouble can only be saved if the lone inheritor (female) gets married...meh."
1,Aftermarket part.,"I ordered the KYB334364 for my suv, after 5 days I recieved the item and I recieved a black strut with a KYB sticker attached to it(generic brand and they attached a KYB sticker). The original KYB is a silver with an imprinted logo on the metal. I called amazon and told them the problem and ask for a replacement but the representative told me they cannot send me another one instead they will give me a refund and she told me they will investigate and they will take the listing for this item but the item is still listed on there website."
4,Good Entry Level Router,"It works pretty good for most work. Only think is you are limited to using 1/4"" shank bits. When overheated sometimes the bit gets stuck. Other than that it is a very reliable router. If you are planning to use with table I would go for a PC 690 or similiar model. That way you will have a lots of choice for tables and the accesories. The power of this Skil router is good. The depth table and the plunge action make it a very easy tool to use. I also bought an accessory guide sold by Skil which I find is useless. Don't spend money on that instead buy an edge guide titled 'Clamp n' Guide'. You can get that in ToolCrib."
3,Still working (long delayed follow up),"(this is a follow up to the message from Jan 2002)My third router has worked so far without failing. I have mostly used it to route pressure treated lumber.I gave it only three stars because I had to get it replaced twice. Otherwise it would have been a 5 starrer.Mind you, I believe my router has not been submitted to rigorous use."
1,not upto expectations - so far,"This router came as a part of a router-table combo kit that I bought at Lowe's, and the router died in the first few hours of use - TWICE. I exchanged the router for a new one, and am hoping that 'third time is a charm' will work for me this time.I have stuck with it so far because it is the lowest priced, and also because of the brand name.I will be sure to update this review if the third one breaks too."
1,This router is way off base,"A router absolutely has to do three things to be useful: spin the bit, hang on to the bit, and hold the bit straight relative to the base. The Skil 1823 fails to fulfill the third function and so cannot be used for routing. The plunge mechanism tends to lock the base up to 1/8"" off kilter and allows the base to wiggle back and forth. It is not just that I got a lemon. Every Skil router with this plunge mechanism that I've tried behaves the same way. The flaw is designed into the tool. No other brand of plunge router I've ever tried permits the base to move this way.I exchanged it for an even cheaper fixed-base Ryobi router that has done its job well for several years now.Skil was once synonymous with the circular saw but has squandered its reputation on frustrating tools like this one."
5,I wish there was a part two!,"I recently adopted an 'unknown breed' dog from a no-kill shelter. While at the Grand Canyon last month, a tourist from Louisiana introduced himself, identified my dog as a Catahoula and gave an overview of the history...naturally I went home, checked the web, and confirmed his background. It has now become a hobby finding more and more information about this fantastic breed. Don Abney's book was a great foundation of knowledge for understanding our new family member and also having fascinating background history to tell my friends/family. All I could ask for is more pictures (color) and a list of reputable breeders/clubs...other than that I highly recommend this book! Thanks Don...."
4,Lovejoy,"Having lived in England and watched this series over there, it was great to see it again. If you love antiques and gentle british humor, you will enjoy this series."
5,LOVEJOY RETURNS!,"Through the years I suppose I've seen each of these TV episodes as they ran on A&E;, and their subsequent reruns, to the point that I also have a couple dozen Lovejoy paperbacks from Penguin on my mystery shelves.I too applaud the issuing of this in Region 1, FINALLY, and also hope the remaining material will not be to far in future release.For anyone viewing these shows and never reading the books, something has been lost. The books can be abit different than the shows, for one example, the character of Tinker Dill is much different than shown on the screen. Though I enjoy both TV show and book, I think my preference leans to the TV show.But no matter, it is all great entertainment from Dr. Gash. Thanks Doctor, even got me interested in things like Antiques Roadshow.Semper Fi."
5,"Mysteries, Comedies, and More!","If you love antiques, or mysteries, or comedies, or any combination thereof, you can't but love Lovejoy. For those who haven't met him yet, he's a bit of a rogue, a lot of a lover, and an expert on everything old. Can't wait for additional seasons to be released. The only problem is the occasional difficulty understanding our British cousins, and the times they speak so softly it's necessary to jack up the volume. But these are less than petty quibbles! Buy it, you'll like...no, love it!"
5,Lovejoy: The First Season,Loved this series when it was on TV...... Brits just do TV/drama/mystery so well..... glad it is now available.
4,Hidden Treasure,"Well, I'm a big fan of these guys and I think this CD is just wonderful. There are two different versions for this album. This one, presented here, was released only in the U.S.. The rest of the world got a slightly different version, without ""I Just Want To Have Something To Do"", ""Havana Affair"" or ""I Don't Wanna Go Down To The Basement"", but with ""Too Tough To Die"", ""Palisades Park"", ""Don't Bust My Chops"" and ""Love Kills"". But the most important difference between these two albums is that the american one has the song ""Carbona Not Glue"". This song appears in the album after ""Pet Semetary"" and before ""Judy Is A Punk"". There are no credits because this is a censored song. It should take place in the 1977 album ""Ramones Leave Home"" but it was censored and it was never released officially (except for a few copies of the album ""Ramones Leave Home""). At least not until this live version..."
1,Awful,"Seriously terrible and ridden with spelling and grammatical mistakes, and that fact that it was written while they were on LSD doesn't make it cool.Oh and the whole bit about being censored by the government is completely falseas anyone with a brain would know.Reading Justin Blackburn will take you a step away from an open mind."
2,Belt will not track right,"The unit will produce sawdust but the ""Auto-trak"" function is a hinderance and cannot be disabled. Once the Auto-trak gets out of kelter the unit throws belts as soon as pressure is applied. Spend twice as much and get a better unit."
2,"Price is hard to pass up, but try your hardest","I bought this sander a couple of years ago while under tough budget restrictions and have regretted it ever since. The auto track feature never worked right, despite much adjusting. Turn on the power and the belt moves 1"" to the right every time. Last week I tried to use it on a piece of furniture thatI'm building and left track lines across the top of the birch. Today I'm shopping for a replacement, this old machine will be permanently mounted on it's side and used as a benchtop edge sander."
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!,"This is one of the lowest-priced belt sanders out there. Now I know why. After purchasing one, I brought it home, did some stripping, and ended up returning it the next day. The sanding belt continuously moved about 1/2"" towards the right after it was turned on. I would stop the sander, readjust it, and turn it on again. The belt would move. Oh, well. Defective product?Other than that, it was not too bad to control, but very loud. It did a decent job in getting dark stain out on the project I am doing.I traded it in for a Makita and am very, very pleased with my trade. I paid about $55 more for the Makita, but it is well worth the extra money."
2,Belt Tracking Trouble,"The ""Auto-Track"" feature doesn't last long, and after it wears out the belt won't track correctly. This unit isn't too bad for the price, I suppose, but I wouldn't buy another one."
2,Snoozer,"Wow, what a snoozer this one was. I picked this up thinking that it would fill a gap in my DVD history collection but it's so dry that I couldn't stay awake. This show has a narrator that you never see and the visuals consist of ruins without a single soul in sight. They do have some historians who talk for a while on camera, but most of the time you are listening to narration while watching an empty landscape. The information might be interesting, but it's probably more exciting to watch paint dry."
3,informative yet tedious,"The first disc of the two is interesting but the second falls a little flat. I knew nothing of the early history of Iran so I can't say if it's glossed over or not. It was given as a gift and well thats how I dealt with it. The English narrative is well done. But it seems to be just a small drop in the bucket of years of history. The video isn't that well shot is my main complaint. I think the PBS program of a few years back was better done, but thts just my opinion , cheers :)"
2,Superior bored,"The game is not difficult, boring, hard to understand for a child 6 years technological, so that little remains for other than fans of video games, my son began and I quit. Do not recommend.El juego no es dificil, es aburrido, dificil de comprender para un niño tecnologico de 6 años, por lo que queda poco para los demás que no sea fanaticos de los video juegos, mi hijo lo comenzo y lo dejo. No lo recomiendo"
2,Limed and Dated,"I was disappointed in this one. It tries to do too many things in a scant 90 pages in undersized format. I don't need someone to tell me about the places the trains go; I can get that information more completely elsewhere. Not too much on AMTRAK; more on private companies that offer restored cars. I am guessing these end up as high-end deals. Did the tour companies sponsor the book?Also,the 2000 publication makes it out of date for the possibly commercial purposes served."
2,A Hodgepodge of Useful Information,"This is a good collection of caffeine-related medical studies, with good technical detail. There's not a lot to it, however -- only 80 pages (not 110 as the description states), and more than a quarter of those pages are taken up by source lists and the index. There's a fair amount of repetition as well. The most noticeable problem, though, is that every other page is blank. No content is missing, but the text is only printed on one side of each sheet of paper, and the other side is blank. I'm at a complete loss to figure out why anyone would do this; I don't think I've ever seen it done before.The information in this book would probably make a very good FAQ file somewhere, but it's not worth $18.95 (especially since the book itself says $16.00 on the cover)."
1,You get what you pay for...,"Bought this product to drill a total of 24 1/2"" holes in concrete (yes i used a masonry bit, even used smaller bits for pilots). The FWD/REV switch locked up within 5 holes. THe variable speed trigger operated at either full speed or slow, no in between. By hole # 18, it competely burned out. Wish I had put the $$ down on a reliable unit. Don't waste your $$."
1,FWR/REV Switch Problems,"I received this 1/2"" hammer drill (Model 6443)as a gift and it looked very impressive. The 1st time I attempted to use the drill, the ""FWD/REV Switch"" did not have any affect on the drill rotation. The drill rotated in a clockwise direction when the reverse lever was pushed to the right or when it was pushed to the left.Unfortunately, my 1st time to take the drill out of the carton and attempt to use it was beyond the warranty period; therefore, it appears I will have to live with this lemon the best I can or buy another one. I noticed that I am not the only one who had this problem, so I assume it must just be a design deficiency with this Skil Drill."
4,Hunters Blood is low budget excitement,This post Deliverance is great to watch.Timothy Bottoms{roller coaster} stars with Joey Travolta and Clu Gallahger as hunters who come across some nasty poachers while hunting deer.Billy Bob Thorton has a bit part and Billy Drago. The scene where one the the guys face gets blown off is a classic.This is well paced throughout while the rest carry to safety Timothy Bottoms takes them all on.There's one who reminded me of Chrispin Glover's brother.Its great and I don't know why it was forgotten...pity!
4,Really cool flick!,"Great Flick! Full of recognisable faces, ""Delivernce"" like, but very goodeffects and story. Please come out on DVD cleaned up! Awesome"
2,OK beginners book,"I didn't find the book particularly helpful, but if you are new to the subject of psychological disorders and dissociative disorders it may be helpful."
2,Boring even for smooth jazz,"I'm going to go against the grain and say this disc is better suited for a hi-rez on-hold playlist for a bank. I am not a huge smooth jazz fan, but after reading the reviews about this DVD-A disc I figured I'd give it a shot. Yes, from a fidelity standpoint this is top notch. But I couldn't get past a minute of any of the songs. Long story short, there are tons of great DVD-A and SACD discs out there. If ultra-smooth jazz is not your thing, don't bother with this one."
3,Fourplay,The music on this supposedly DVD-Audio is good but I could not get it to play on 5 or 6 channels ....I could only get the left and right speaker and I have got a Yamaha DVS 100 Home theatre system
4,It's all about DVD Audio,"This album was my first DVD Audio purchase and I will never go back to CD. If you are into smooth jazz this is the DVD for you. After a long day at work this music will relax you like a warm bubble bath. I didn't really know Fourplay before, but the talent and their hot fingers will remind you that there are still good musicians out there. They could have rocked a bit more for my taste but when I need good music while reading a good book. I pop up Fourplay into my 5.1 system.Rock On."
3,Foreplay CD,"I was excited to find that you had this CD available. I was traveling back to Oklahoma City from Texas and heard this song on satellite radio and loved it! The song that caught my attention was the upbeat song entitled Bali Run. When I got the CD and played it I was disappinted to find that Bali Run, the first song on tbe CD was distorted and the music was miffled for about three minutes then I could hear it. I thought it might be the CD player but I have tried it in three CD players with the same result. All of the other songs are fine though."
5,HOOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT ONE!!,"WE GOT A HOT ONE HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EXCELLENT JAZZ, VERY RELAXING, VERY MUSICAL. I DIDNT HERE NO NOISE ON THIS DVD AUDIO. 5.1 ADVANCED RESOLUTION SURROUND, SWEET!![...]"
5,Fourplay DVD audio,This is an excellent jazz 6 channal cd. I have the regular cd and is very good but when I play this one on SACD/DVD audio player is was something else.Wonderful.
4,"Works pretty well, except for cleaning","Been using this for several months now. Does a good job of staying in place, covering a large area, and catching food.The downside, though, is the cleaning. It's a bit too big to fit in a sink, so you can only clean one half at a time, with the other half sticking over the side of the sink. The big issue, though, is that the material can't be completely wrung out. So after every meal, we have two of these things, sopping wet, draped over the stove, countertop, whatever we can find. And they often don't dry by the next meal.So . . . good enough at what they do for us to keep using them, but the cleaning part could be better."
4,On Grandpop's Lap,"""On Grandpop's Lap"" written by Cathy Helowicz and illustrated by Ginger Doyel, celebrates in a quiet way the love and understanding between a young boy and his grandfather. The words and illustrations blend well together and there is a nice balance between Zachary's energy when he visits his grandparents and finally his request to sit quietly on Grandpop's lap and listen to Grandpop telling him a story about the things he did when he was a little boy."
5,Parallel Bible,"The New Hendrickson Parallel Bible: King James Version, New King James Version, New International Version, New Living Translation, 2nd EdI love this bible. I love it because the versions are side by side which makes it easy for cross referencing. I highly recommend it."
5,Great bible,This bible is wonderful because of the new living translation. It makes it easier to understand while doing a bible study. Highly recommend this bible.
5,The best versions all together!,This parallel bible is fabulous. It's great to have the best versions side by side for easy comparison.
3,not for those of us with aging eyes,"If your eyes are starting to have any trouble with reading - this book is 0 stars. The print is the LIGHTEST, it is very small and it is very compacted together. I have other multiple Bibles that have small print but I don't have a problem reading them when using my reading glasses; this Bible I just can't get the print to stay in focus no matter how hard I try.For the translations it provides - it is 5 star. I like them all, they would be the ones I would personally chose as the best.The KJV is a bit hard to understand by itself with its older English style, but perfect next to the NKJV, plus the NIV and NLT which are easy to read in current language (I would recommend the ESV as a good translation to look into)But sadly, this Bible is unreadable for me because of the print they chose to use - light/faded, very small and very compacted together."
3,The New Hendrickson Parallel Bible,Preferred the Today's Parallel Bible because it had more translation than the revisions in the Hendrickson's
5,Neil Young's Grungy Groove,"Send the women and children to the mall, and turn this baby up. Especially the subwoofer. But just crank it up. A strong and long-time devotee of the 1st. Amendment, in the tradition of Frank Zappa; Neil pulls no punches. Great solid rock, delivered well. Get both parts of the album. Nothing schmaltzy here, no PC crap, just great rock."
5,The World of Weld,"This is a live album, with both acoustic and electric songs. The acoustic songs are really relaxing tunes, good compositions and the form a real balance to the electrical stuff ont this album (like Hey hey, Welfare Mothers). If you want to discover two sides of Neil Young, this is the album to have. It shows Neil Young at his best: live, electric and acoustic. I think its his best live album till now. It will give you the perfect live feeling, just like you are there in the arena. Check it out, buy it and discover the World of Weld."
4,Plugged.,"In the search for live Neil, there's the mellow ""Unplugged"", the noisier and better ""Live Rust"", and this electric rocker. ""Weld"" is far from perfect, but that's exactly what makes it so good. It's loud, sometimes sloppy, and it's the band and Neil in all their foot-stompin' glory. It's also a good mix of hits as well as obscure songs. Disc one gives us the great and lengthy ""Crime In The City"", Dylans ""Blowin' In The Wind"", the spicey ""Cinnamon Girl"", and ""F*ckin' Up"", which Pearl Jam has covered well. Disc two has the classic ""Cortez The Killer"", ""Roll Another Number"", ""Rockin' In The Free World"", and ""Powderfinger"", a song I've heard Cowboy Junkies do. There's no doubt Neil Young has two essential sides to his music. ""Harvest"" is one side, this is the other."
2,Good music-Bad sound( Side one ),"I don't know what the problem is but side one sounds as if it was recorded on a old tape machine that was located far from the stage. Side two is Okay so I wonder if it is a one shot production error. Whatever, it soured me on some of my favorite Neil Young songs. -If this has not been reported before, and this is a one time problem with this individual Cd(side one) I wish that Amazon would remedy this with another copy of that side----Side tow is just fine and I am pleased with it, BUT, I paid for, and was expecting TWO discs in good shape."
3,These Aren't The Original Recordings! They Are Rerecordings!,I don't think this Brenda Lee Christmas CD is awful and I don't have anything against singers rerecording their old songs but I can understand why some people were very disappointed and thought they were getting the original recordings because it always seems when a music studio puts out a CD or cassette tape of rerecordings of a popular singer that they print the info in such tiny print where you need a magnifying glass to read the fine print but with that said I think the rerecordings are actually good. No they aren't as good as the originals but they aren't bad either and I would recommend this CD to fans of Brenda Lee who can tolorate rerecordings!
1,Not impressed,"This cd was disappointing. I was looking for some of the original recordings that I used to listen to on 8 track. It turned out that all of these songs were recorded more recently. If you are looking for an early recording of ""Jingle Bell Rock"" or other favorites, this is not the cd that you want."
2,Not so great...there are better products to choose from,I got this mainly for single source of output for both DVD and VCR. It turned out that this product had two seperate outputs for DVD and VCR so more wires to hook up to TV.I recommend to buy Sony brand instead for ease of use and durability.
1,VCR does not work,"We were hopeful, but twice failed by Toshiba (once one the V592 and once on the ""replacement"" V594 The VCR would not display, regardles of output chosen. Customer service was unable to assist or trouble shoot. I have given up and ordered something else."
1,Disappointed,"No DVD-RW; No HDMI cable and a lot of others. The unit is in permanent storage and still in the original box. I lost only a little over $100.- Looking for someone who will deliver what they promiss.George Vastagh, Germantown, TN"
3,Incomplete Product Review,I have not purchased this item yet. I am looking for a DVD/VHS player/recorder that will record VHS tapes to DVD. I have read the product review double talk that supposedly describes this unit. All I see is that you can play a DVD while recording a program on tape. Who records to tape any more ? That's why I want a DVD recorder. A Panasonic unit that sells for $100 more says it will do what I want but it only has 2 1/2 stars so I am reluctant to buy it. I often wonder why the people who write reviews and instructions to these type of products seem to be in another world ? That's why I gave it 3 stars- Sight unseen!
2,Great DVD player but lousy cd player,"I would not suggest you buy this if you plan to play cd's on this unit. The picture quality is excellent for dvd's and only good for video tapes!We bought this to use as our cd player as well, but cd's skip and stop at any given moment.I recommend the unit if all you want is a dvd/vcr."
5,Return to classic films,"As someone who relies on a computer, but seldom used a VCR,, I am now very pleased with operating the combination DVD/VCR I recently purchased. It is easy to operate, and I am now seeing films I enjoyed when younger."
3,Cognitive Neuroscience,"This book is recommended especially to the biginners of this field, The illustrations cited are very beautiful and easy to understand,making it possible to read through whthin relatively a short period. Yet the basics of cognitive neuroscience are fully covered,so for those who want to overview the history of this field,or to start studing and designing some experiments in this area should surely find this book usable."
5,Glue to Me,Works as expected but okay sdl'fj'ljf'jsd'fj'sdfjs'djf'sdjf'l sd'fjsdljf sdlfjsl a a a a a a a a aa a a a
5,One of the best model glues,"If you want to glue resin, metal or phot-etch scale model parts, this is the glue I prefer. I have been using it for years. It works on plastic as well. It makes a strong bond."
4,A journalistic examination of mans ties with aparthied,"I found My Traitor's Heart beautifully written. His strong sense of structure of his 3 books within a single book, explaining his and his families life with apartheid. Malan's journalistic skills are evident in his narrative through his detailed examination of events, especially in Book Two when many murders take place. Although Malan's intent on writing this novel may or may not be justified as some view him as a complete ""liar"", My Traitor's Heart still captivates the struggles between white and blacks during and after apartheid with precision."
5,Tales from the inside looking out,"This book gives an astonishing look into the reality of man(kind) and the desire to maintain an existence, virtually by any means necessary. Clearly, Mr. Malan's vivid writing style captures you and really makes one think about; Why are human race relations the way they are? Truly a courageous piece, which will undeniably pierce your soul."
3,enlightening rambling,"The purpose of this book was very educational and interesting but the structure was confusing which resulted in my loss of attention. The brevity of the individual narratives gives no closure. I was left hanging with the middle facts without a beginning or ending to complete each narrative, then thrust into the next narrative without time to digest the previous one."
5,The most powerful book I've ever read.,"As an Africanist scholar and as an American living in South Africa I've read more books about this country than I can remember. None however has affected me quite like this one. I was given the book by a professor about four or five years ago and I've read it over and over again ever since. I cannot begin to explain how powerful, personal, mind expanding and truly rare this book is. Just read it, I promise it will change your whole view of the world."
1,No Chinese learned here,"I bought Jade when my son was just under 2. He loved her. If you're looking for an electronic baby-sitter, this will work for you. However, if you were hoping that your child would learn or maintain language skills, this will not help at all. Jade speaks primarily in English, with occasional Mandarin vocabulary words thrown in. But no one learns a language by hearing single words in isolation! This is absolutely useless for language learning. But (as I said) my son really did like it, so it made some long plane flights a lot more manageable."
4,My daughter likes it and can now count to 10,"I am an adoptive father of a daughter from Anhui, China. I have the Jade videos to try to help us learn some Chinese. My daughter enjoys the Jade videos. Thanks to this one she can count to 10 in Chinese. I just wish there were more videos in the series than just two."
4,Fun basic learning videos in Chinese,"It appears that some reviewers are expecting Hollywood production when purchasing videos for learning Chinese - both by Jade and by Mei Mei and then they feel dreadfully disappointed when they find out that's not the case.Nevertheless, if your purpose for buying these videos is to learn few basic words and expressions in Chinese - the videos will help you to do just that.The songs in Jade's videos have mixed English and Chinese words.The videos are made for kids, but I purchased them nevertheless when I was learning my first words in Chinese, together with many other programs and the songs had enough of catchy tunes that the words and tunes stuck in my mind even a year later without go back over those programs.And as the other reviewer noted, it's a good idea to visit Chinasprouts - there have a great selection of videos and books to help children learn Chinese."
5,Great story about a great athlete,Really good look into the life of Bo Jackson and all of his accomplishments. My husband and I enjoyed sharing this great man's story with our 2 boys
3,"Its good, but redundant.","This is for the ""Broke"" episode.I liked the concept, but entertaining it is not. Its got way too many interview pieces one right after the other. I have the 1st 30 for 30 collection and sometimes it got a little too ""interview-y""...the storytelling is cheapened in a way with all those snippets of personal accounts thrown together with not too much else. Hard for the teenagers to get with the people in the episode because they retired before a lot of them were born. Usually that age difference is overcome by good storytelling and timing. Not so much with this one."
5,'Bo' is well worth watching!,"This film was very well done - it told an amazing story in a comprehensive way. I would have enjoyed more clips from actual games, and I could have done without the little animation pieces, but I thoroughly loved remembering the accomplishments of this gifted man."
5,No Place Like Home - Allen Fieldhouse,This was one of my favorite sports documentary! I mean all the 30 for 30's are exciting to watch!!Enjoy!
3,Nice looking shoe but not very comfortable,I purchased these shoes for my husband. He has a very easy foot to fit. He has worn them twice and both times found them very uncomfortable.
5,"Great Fit, Great Buy","My husband really likes the loafers. They fit and they are comfortable, plus they look good. What else can you ask? Of course, being a Gold Box Deal of the Day was great, too."
3,Pretty good book with great pictures and original people.,"I love the fact that you can learn so much from this book. I am dissapointed though, in the fact it seems to be pieced together uncarefully. Great book. Worth the low Amazon price!"
4,"Great book, thoroughly enjoyed","Been a Dylan fan for a long time and this book came pretty close to answering the questions that have popped up over the years, you know questions you just can help asking...like what was Sara like and what happened to the marriage. None of my business but I can't help wondering. I thought the pictures were excellent and think if you're a Dylan fan, you'll like it too!"
4,Nice Coffee Table Book,"I'm commenting on the hard-cover version of this book - and I've gotta' say I love it. Great writing, great pictures, printed on high-quality stock. I'm sure for some folks, much of this has been covered before - but I've not read a lot about Dylan. He's been an important part of my life for most of my life; at one time or another I've owned almost all of his legitimate recorded work & spent many hours listening to it. I'd cite him as a major influence on me; I just never much cared to read about the guy before. I'd recommend this book for anyone who thinks they might be interested in it, and I'll say it exceeded my expectations."
3,"Good, not great","If you're a fan of Andrew Szava-Kovats's work (Data Bank A, Dominion, Compound), chances are you just can't get enough of the guy's doomy, epic voice. And ""The Deconstruction"" features it prominently enough. It's just that he's gotten lyrically lazy, and the result is that a lot of the songs sound formulaic--as though he's in a serious songwriting rut. Rhyming structures keep repeating themselves, and after the third such song it's hard to take the album seriously. Nevertheless, it's good to hear him still making music, even if it isn't up to par with the stuff he used to make."
4,Tool-less blade changing makes all the difference,"Skill makes two different models under this number. The one shown here features the ""Switchblade"" tool-less blade changing system, which makes changing a worn or broken blade a simple 5 second operation. This is extremely usefull for those of us who spend a lot of time with the jigsaw, and especially if you tend to work with harder woods which will wear your blades out quicker.The 4445 has all the power you need for continuous use and provides that power with a tolerably low level of vibration, allowing more use without developing numb or tired hands.With the blade orbit adjustments and the variable speed settings, this jigsaw can tackle cuts through materials from cedar to hardwoods, and even metal work without overworking the tool. I've used a lot of jigsaws, but this is my favorite yet."
5,Excellent jigsaw for homeowner!,"I have owned this jigsaw for over a year. It operates smoothly and vibration is nil. Power is excellent. Great features. Blade stays straight on curves with little if any tilt. I thought it might not be all that durable until it fell 6 feet from a shelf to a concrete floor and had NO damage. I own a number of Milwaukee tools, all of which are excellent, and would just love a Milwaukee 6266 jigsaw, but this saw is so good that I can't excuse getting rid of it for the Milwaukee. Very hard to beat for the money."
3,"Great products, poor constuction","At first, I was very impressed with this saw... it could do anything! It was exactly what I needed for my small projects. However, after just four months, It BROKE!! The part that you insert the blade into snapped off!! Fortunately, This product comes with a good warranty, and I got it fixed for free!"
2,Nothing the fanatics don't know,"If you are a major West Wing fan, this book is NOT for you. There is nothing in here the dedicated fans and internet users do not already know! This is just a book of facts - and many wrong ones at that - and older photos. Nothing new in these pages!If you are a new viewer to West Wing and want to catch up, I might recommend this book. However, all of the information here - and thensome - is available on the internet for free."
1,Not worth it for the serious fan,"If you're a *serious* fan of The West Wing -- and you people know who you are -- this book is not for you.Too much of the book was an episode summary; you can get that for free at any one of several terrific TWW web sites. I will say that the best part of Challen's book was the chapter devoted to four West Wing fan sites. It's always good to see an author who recognizes where the real fans hang out. <g>Overall, I would have liked to see more information about the actors, and I DEFINITELY expected to see more pictures and behind-the-scenes tidbits. Has Mr. Challen ever been behind-the-scenes of this show? From some of the mistakes he made, I'm not convinced he's watched every episode.In other words, if you're a true fan -- you don't need this book."
1,Sounds like it was written by a high school girl,"Fortunately I received this as a gift and didn't waste my money. I am usually a very patient, tolerant individual but it was hard for me not to throw this book across the room. The errors are abundant and many of them could have been avoided had someone proofread the darn book. After having read through the episode summaries I find it hard to believe that Mr. Challen actually watched entire episodes. It wouldn't take more than looking at the list of guest stars to realize that Zoey Bartlet did not appear in ""Ellie"". I would not recommend this book to serious fans of The West Wing, especially those who are ""seriously committed to the idea of 'continuity'."""
2,This only covers the first two seasons.,"True Confessions: I have not read this book, and I will not read this book, because it only covers the first two seasons of the seven season run of ""The West Wing"". I place a review here to alert you to what may be the most informative book on ""The West Wing"", `Inside Bartlett's White House' by English entertainment journalist, Keith Topping, in its `Revised and Updated' incarnation. It may no longer be in print, and it may not be perfect, since it only covers the episodes up to the departure of Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe) But up to that point, it is full of facts and information about all the arcane references stuck into the dialogue. Especially useful is the names of every single cast member and on which episodes they appeared."
3,Look before you leap,"This book wasn't what I expected it to be. There are errors throughout the book and they should have been caught before this book was published. From the wrong dates, wrong episode information, mispellings of names, and on.I couldn't even enjoy this book because of all of the errors. (...)"
1,"Hardcore Fans, beware","If you're a hardcore West Wing fan, save yourself some money and nerves and skip this one. It's got more mistakes in it than a high school girl's essay."
3,Not Bad,A good start for West Wing fans... There are a few errors...ie: George McGovern was neither a Gov. or from Minnesota...Overall alot of fun to gander at.
5,Why is it out of print???,"This is a wonderful book and I'm sorry its out of print. Its the story of a teenage boy named Kip and an old man who is a retired sailor, together they set out to save a beached whale. If you love the sea and whales you will love this story. I cried."
4,Vampires and Werewolves ! ! ! !,"This is a great simple game with bizzare side scrolling action. You battle all kinds of nightmarish monsters to try to get to Dracula. This was one of the first games that I ever played for Gameboy and it quickly became one of my favorites! After you play it enough to finish it, you probably won't want to play it again for while but I think it's a good one for a cold rainy day because there are not any other games quite like this one. It's fun and simple."
1,One star is too good for this turkey,"Denzel Washington and Bob Hoskins tested many critics' high opinion of them by co-starring in this awful supernatural comedy. Hoskins is a racist cop with a weak heart. Washington is a slick lawyer who dies and has his heart transplanted into Hoskins. Denzel's ghost haunts Hoskins. Picture ""Watermelon Man"" and ""All of Me"" combined, and done stupidly. The low point comes when Hoskins awakes after his operation and finds a huge black dildo his prankster buddies have planted in his pajamas. The two antagonists must work together to catch Denzel's murderers and save Hoskins' hooker sweetheart Chloe Webb. Denzel won his Oscar for ""Glory"" not long before this was released; if not for that, it probably would've gone straight to video. It would be a waste of time and money even to rent this (never mind buy it) to see for yourself how bad it is."
4,Silent Pleasure,"Do not attempt to operate heavy machinery or drive a motor car whilst listening to this music. A true musical journey into another world. For the full listening experience you must hear this through headphones sat in your favourite comfy chair or whilst stoned. Sit back and enjoy the soundscapes and the natural sounds. Not quite as good as Lunar Phase but if you can get hold of any HMC then do so, because it is very hard to come by. HMC produce true ambient music at its best!"
5,"Peter, Paul & Mary in their prime","Peter, Paul and Mary, sweet smoke and tear gas in the afternoon. They bring back memories to all who were there (and can remember). The sound, the voices and the message, however, are timeless. This is PP&M in their prime. Replace your old vinyl or add an new album to your collection."
4,One of their best albums,"Released around 1965, this album showcases PP&M in their heyday. You get a wide variety of types of songs, in a wide variety of arrangements, so that the old cliche of something to please everyone is pretty close to the mark. One of the strangest tracks is ""On a Desert Island,"" a British music hall song from the turn of the last century, and done precisely in that style. I have never been able to make any sense of the lyrics of ""First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,"" but Mary's voice is astoundingly lovely in the PP&M rendition. Union/Labor and rebellion songs are well represented with ""If I Were Free,"" ""The Rising of the Moon,"" ""Because All Men are Brothers,"" and the old classic ""Brother, Can You Spare a Dime"" (more relevant in 2010 than ever). I guess my favorite on the album was ""Hangman."" One of the more baffling songs is ""Jane, Jane"" which might be a sort of Christmas Carol written as if by James Joyce."
4,touching songs for the heart and soul,"Point of Light is an amazing song, one everyone should memorize and live by. Randy has a voice that really brings his music to life."
4,"Great sound, but hard to integrate","The system arrived on time with some slight damage to the sub-woofer case, but nothing that hurts the way it works. Set-up was easy and the sound and picture from the DVD player is excellent. Only problem is getting the system to integrate well with the TV and DirecTV. I have not been able to get all three pieces of equipment to work well using the DirecTV RC32 remote control, so there is a lot of fumbling for the various remotes."
5,A great System,Everything I expected from a system I got from Samsung. And I do Not work for them to give a reveiw like this.
1,I wish someone would have warned me about this product...,"Purchased 6/06... First issue was that the sound was OK for CD / DVD playback but poor for FM. There are not bass or treble adjustments...only an EQ function with some ""preset"" settings. If this unit had an actual EQ, the sound quality issues could be probably be eliminated.Also, a known ""bug"" (as I have seen this issue on other sites) is red dots on the screen with DVD playback using the HDMI cable. Unfortunately, my wife threw away the box so I could not return the unit... Now I have been waiting almost a month to get my unit back as I had to take it in in for warranty repair to have the HDMI port replaced.As this is the system was intended for use in my living room, I will probably end up selling it or using the HT-Q80 as a DVD player in the bedroom and purchasing a better sounding home theater system."
3,Disappointed.... DVD player freezes while watching a movie,"We bought this HT system 12/06. Like another reviewer pointed out, didn't come with brackets for the speakers - fine, didn't really expect them to be included. The surround sound works great, not complaints. DVD player is another story. It freezes while the DVDs are playing, making it impossible to enjoy the movie. Contacted Samsung, had to mail the DVD unit to their service center -- received it back, the problem was still not fixed. Now we have to mail the DVD unit back to them AGAIN, hoping they'll find what the problem is, and either fix it or replace the player. Very disappointed, very frustrating, wishing we bought a different brand."
3,Hitchcock Among the Quotes,"Charlotte Chandler's 2005 portrait of Alfred Hitchcock reads more like an extended gossip column than a traditional biography. Though occasionally insightful and entertaining, the author would have benefited from paraphrasing some of the lengthy quotes from her numerous interviews. ""It's Only a Movie"" may not represent the finest book on the Master of Suspense (try Franois Truffaut's ""Hitchcock"" and Patrick McGilligan's ""A Life in Darkness and Light""), yet it avoids the bleak unpleasantness of Donald Spoto's ""The Dark Side of Genius."""
3,As superficial as his movies weren't,"Though it gives a good view of how his career went the author never really delves deep into the personality of Hitchcock, even though she talked to many who knew him. It disconnects the man from the brilliant movies, which are also talked about in just a few pages. It never really tells you why his movies were that great. Maybe it's not possible to do that in300 pages, but I had expected more."
5,Get out your lighters...it's power ballad time!,"Hold them aloft into the air as The Darkness unleash more Rock and Roll! This is one of the best tracks on their album, and this single has great b-sides you can't find anywhere else. Here's the tracks.1. Love Is Only A Feeling- Great song, awesome soloing. Some of Justin Hawkins best lyrics. I've seen them make girls cry with this song when they play live, THAT's the power of Rock and Roll!2. Planning Permission- Happy, Rocking song, all about building a house! Oohhhh yeah!3. Curse Of The Tollund Man- Spanish guitar work supplies the music in this song, which is about an old legend, the Tollund Man. Different from anything else they've released, but still Rocks!Pick up this single today, and be entranced by the magic of The Darkness! Make sure you catch them on tour in the States, you'll not be disappointed!"
5,More than a Mentor,"A friend gave me this book as a present. I was rather expecting more of the usual 'feel the fear and do it anyway' self-help guff but The Artist's Mentor really was a revelation. Wonderfully well-researched, helpfully structured quotations tied together thematically by Jackman's non-partisan and clear-headed prose, build into a great little book that's a deal more than a mentor, it's also a handy reference and an absorbing insight into the painterly mind. I am a writer by profession but I found this book fascinating and useful for my own work. An excellent workbook for anyone interested in creative endeavour of all kinds."
3,Helpful but not Inspiring,"As a professional artist, I appreciated that the book attempts to address the emotional concerns of artists in the current art market and avoids many of the cliches intended to motivate amateur painters. Somehow I'm comforted knowing that even famous artists had difficulty overcoming that inexplicable resistance to getting into the studio and starting. Yet the book seemed a little flat, not as inspiring as I'd hoped."
5,Best book for artists,"My first copy was given to me by a vey good friend, who is also an artist. I'm an artist. Everything I have thought about as I journey through life being an artist is covered in this book. It seems that all artists share the same thoughts and concerns and this book puts it all into understandable context. it is clearly written, interesting, not academic in style, and fun to read. I read it three times on a recent European trip. I filled the pages with notes and observations. I couldn't stop reading it. Then I lost the book. So I bought a second one from Amazon. I've recommended it to students and friends who are artists. My new copy is also filled with notes. It is the best book about art that I've read, even though it is little and unassuming. What do artists think about stuff? It's in here."
5,Great birp cloth!,I use disposable diapers but I got some of these as a shower gift. They make great birp cloths. They are very absorbent and they keep spit up from running down your shoulder. The prints are very cute also.
2,No better than regular tic-tac-toe,"I was expecting that a 3-D tic-tac-toe game would not have a strategy as trivial as the 2-D tic-tac-toe.Unfortunately it does. My 7-year-old spent about 1 hour on it, then gave it back to me, saying: ""there is a strategy that works all the time. Let's give this toy away"".Don't waste your money. After the first few minutes your kids won't like it and neither will you."
4,If you're in law school read this!,"A fabulous book for two reasons. It chronicles a disaster that is virtually unknown beyond the state of West Virginia. Secondly, it's a great tool for any law student in a Civil Procedure class. Forget about ""A Civil Action"" or ""Erin Brockovich"", this book best depicts the struggles of those who suffered, both the victims and the lawyers who fought for the people in the Buffalo Creek region."
5,Great true life story,"The book was amazing. Really a good read. The story of what happened to those poor people when the Buffalo Creek Dam broke is absolutely heartbreaking, but they were able to triumph in the end. The book is not bogged down with legalese as it so easily could have been, making it accessible to readers who are not familiar with the law world and its idiosyncracies. Very well written. I highly recommend!"
3,True legal drama that reads like fiction,"Sympathetic, descriptive, heart-wrenching, sweet and triumphant. These are the adjectives suitable to describe this novel. It is the true story of the actual Buffalo Creek Disaster and written by the lead attorney for the plaintiffs. It is a candid story of how a community of coal miners banded together and brought suit against a huge coal company and made them pay. Some witness recollections are almost unbearable to read, the depth of description and emotion evoked will bring tears to your eyes. Its a short and enjoyable, and if you are not familiar with legal jargon its novice friendly."
5,There are lawyers who do good,"I was assigned to read this for my Civil Procedure class in law school. Although I dreaded reading it, once I started, I could not put it down. As a law student (or if you are a lawyer for that matter), this was a great insight into how a lawsuit is constructed on such a grand scale. Even if you have no interest in law, Stern manages to tell such a compelling story, I would recomend this book to anyone. It provides great insight into the operations of a corrupt coal company, a state and region at the industry's mercy, and people who felt helpless when their lives were destroyed by the mining company's negligence and the state's oversight. A definite must read."
4,Easy and compelling read!,I read this before starting law school. Great lesson on civil procedure. But also a heart-wrenching story of human lives lost unnecessarily.
3,"All about the lawyer, not about the victims","This book was required for a law school class. It will be much more appealing for law school students and tort lawyers than readers who are truly interested in the victims of the disaster or the disaster itself. The book is not about disaster but about the author's legal maneuvering which lead to a successful outcome for his firm and, according to him, for the victims of the disaster. It is easy to read and the author details his strategies he used during litigation. For those who can see through the self-righteous slant and who grow ill of the legal profession, this book is not for you."
2,Randy B,"This is one of Mark Whitfield's earlier albums. I became an instant fan of his when I saw him perform live with Jimmy Smith. His rendition of the old torch song ""Midnight Sun"" in this performance made me rush out to find it on one of his albums. It turns out it was on ""Patrice"". I subsequently found the recorded version, on acoustic guitar (rather than the electric acoustic used in the live performance) fell far short of the live performance. I'm tempted to write him and tell him to re-record it for a new album. The remainder of the album is fair to good. It's clear his expertise has improved since he recorded ""Patrice"""
1,"Not a very good heater, IMO","I received and put this tiki heater together yesterday. Even after an initial five minute warm up you could not feel the radiant heat coming out of the cylindrical grill. I cranked it up pretty high too, but to get close enough to feel the warmth was about 18 inches, at which point I was afraid of catching my hair on fire. The price is not worth it, spend a bit more and get a real patio heater."
1,Not what I expected... in a bad way,"Although it looks cool and decorative, it doesn't radiate enough heat. If you are more than a foot away from it, you can't feel it at all.You'll wish you had bought a bigger patio heater. This item is not worth the $ they are charging for it. Should be like $25 or less. I'm very disappointed."
2,WAR MACHINE SONGS NEEDED TO BE INCLUDED,"They needed to include a few songs from Andrea's 1980 album War Machine including the title track. The last 2 songs and on this GH collection are lousy songs yet still prove Andrea had a good voice. ""White Witch"" should never have been made as a song, it is filler and nothing else.The great songs:More, More, More, Pt. 1Party LineKeep It Up LongerCall MeThe good songs:N.Y. You Got Me DancingWhat's Your Name, What's Your NumberThe bad songs with good voice:Sally Can't DanceLife Is What You Make ItIt's All Up to YouNever should have seen the light of day:White Witch"
4,"Useful Replacement Parts, But Pricey !","I certainly agree with Eric's review : these replacement parts are very pricey and now cost as much as the original electric razor cost me in 2003 from Wal-Mart.That said, as long as my Braun 3612 electric razor keeps running I will replace these parts, the foil is usually the one that gets torn and that determines the replacement frequency.I source these parts through amazon.com because I have been unable to find any retailer in my area that still stocks them."
1,Dull Foil and Cutter,The replacement foil and cutter was dull with in 3 weeks and cutting up my face. These usually last me 6+ months. I made the mistake of ordering 3 sets from this seller. It seems like any that come affixed to cardboard are terrible and go dull quickly and the ones that are packaged in the hard to open plastic type container are the good ones. Very disappointed. Will not order these from this seller again.
2,Excellent Player..poor sound,"Bought the unit earlier this year...sold it by the end. Great DVD player with upconverting dvd's to 1080i and controls very user friendly i thought. Only thing that i noticed right away was the sound quality, muddy kinda sound (Therefore making voices hard to distinguish unless turn up). Not sure if its just the speakers but doesn't have that crisp sound. Had a Panasonic HTIB before and was waaaayy better sounding than this. Again not sure if changing the speakers helps (which possibly could) but then again, is it worth doing? Actually looked into it but just went with a Bose 321, which I highly recomend =). Again if sound quality is not THAT important its a great system. If your looking for better quality for round the same price range, an Onkyo would defenitly be a better buy!"
5,Awsome,"This product is the best home theater I have ever owned. Matched it with a Samsung 1080i DLP and get great picture and sound quality. Can't beat it for the money. Very easy set-up, only problem was that it is deep so watch cabinet size."
4,"Pretty good home theater, but be careful!","I was amazed at the price for this home theater system with all the features it has. Upconversion looks pretty good. Sound quality is pretty good, but could use some tweaking (sometimes bass overpowers everything else). XM radio ready was what really got me excited about it and works good although sometimes its a pain in the [...] to read the info on the screen, it's real slow and usually cuts of the last part of the name of the song. After having this in my home for about 2 weeks I turned it on and shocked it. Well the whole screen went out and the volume knob no longer worked. I took the reciever/dvd player back and it was replaced no problem from Circuit City. Would have had to ship it back to Samsung and wait 2 weeks or more for them to fix it. So now I just make sure to use the controller to turn it on. Overall I'm very happy with it and for the price I dont think you can beat it."
4,Keep away from children,"This product is great. The only problem we had was that our son stuck a ball in the sub-woofer, and there is no way to get it out. Quite silly, but annoying."
3,from my hometown too,Everybody wants to be like you was a generally good song I could relate to but it was overplayed like crazy on the radio. I've got to give it to him for being in the game for so long though. What a shame the US considers him a one hit wonder for informer cause that he is not
5,Snow is back and he will take the U.S.,Snow is back and he is going to stay. Well he has always been just not in the U.S.. If you like Snow then you need to get this cd. And you can go to his website... So go see you will be happy you did. Stacy B. Go Snow
1,Not That Fun.,"This wasn't much fun, the chracters were badly desgined and it sucked. I think the super Nintendo version will be better."
3,Ha! Ha! It's an okay game,It's a really fun game. You do something different on each level.It's not that confusing. It's so amazing I can't even begin to describe it.:)
2,Difficult to use,"The ""wiping"" motion needed to use this tool on plants is awkward. It actually works great for hitting weeds growing in hard surfaces (patio bricks, driveway gravel) where you can just press down on them, but in the garden bed, where weeds are near plants, it's difficult to get the right action going. I found I was not able to get a solid layer of weed killer on the leaves easily. Might be another star or two if you did not need to use it in beds."
4,Pretty darn great for the price,"This 2.1 speaker system isn't going to win any awards, but hey, it doesn't have to. It totally does the job, and at an awesome price. And don't misunderstand me---this isn't ""good enough."" It's WAY better than that. The subwoofer has a nice warm tone, and that was with the bass only turned up about a 1/3 of the way. The speakers are a little too light for my taste (giving the feeling like they are fragile), but the clarity of the mids and highs is quite nice. I could do without the separate volume knob. It's pretty dorky, and I can totally see it getting lost on my computer desk. But this system is definitely on the plus side of economical. Highly recommended, as long as you're not an audio freak!"
4,Good Speakers,I've had these speakers for about a year now. But they are all white. They must have came out with black after I got my set. I was surprised when I hooked these up! Wow..a lot of base from an 8W subwoofer! Compared to my old altec lansing speakers..10 times better! Finally I gave in not too long ago. I just wanted some higher performance. So I recently ordered some A Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 system for around 150 with tax and shipping. These Philips speakers are great If you don't want to pay a lot for a high end system.
5,Great home speakers,I've had these speakers for over a year and have been very impressed. For 30 dollars they come with a good subwoofer and 2 speakers. They are great for small rooms and large rooms. I have them connected to my PC and HDTV. The are a big improvement over the stock speakers. I could not see myself spending more than 100 dollars on home speakers after using this product. For 30 dollars I got everything I need and they look and sound great.
4,Great Speakers!,"Great speakers for the price. Easy set up. 38 Watts. I would highly recommend these for a mid price speaker set, great sub-woofer with bass control."
5,You can't beat the sound quality for the price,"Plain and simple - this product is a winner. Amazon's price is better than Wal-Mart, so grab one while you can."
2,Live and learn,"I purchased these speakers to go along with a new PC I had ordered. Going by reviews, it seemed like the speakers would fit my needs. After using them for a short time, I realized my $40.00 mistake. There is almost no bass! The sub-woofer is terrible!The speakers do not sound loud, even when turned up all the way. I have 2.1 Harman/Kardon speakers. The sub is 40 watts. I thought they were very good speakers, but 9 years old. I figured I was upgrading. I just wasted $40.00, the new Philips will sit in the box.My mistake."
3,Protocols of Zion,Not what I expected.It was done by a different Mark Levin than the one on radio.No new information at all.
2,Give me a Break,"Imagine a movie that starts with a premise that racism still exists in the United States. In order to prove this, they go and find the nastiest, sleaziest white supremicists they can find, and stick them in front of the camera.That's what this film does with anti-semitism. It talks about a document called the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and examines it in detail. This document is discredited and is believed only by the kooks and flakes of the world. And it's those flakes that this film goes to great pains to seek out and interview.And so Levin ""proves"" that there is rampant antisemitism in the United States. Whatever."
1,Protocols of Zion,"The video is totally mislaeding and has nothing to do with Protocols of Zion. I regrett buying it, a waste of money.very very poor"
1,Ridiculous,"Leave it to the Jews to figure out a way to turn 9/11 into something about them !!!! Mark Levin needs to go to Isreal and document things that are important to his foriegn, hate filled, self important people. I had issues against the Jews before this video and after watching my hatred, prejudice and the need to join a white supremicst group was re-inforced. Judenrat ........... IT IS NOT AN AGSAGGERATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great book!,"Very well written and exciting! Sometimes moved too quickly with little explanation, but once started I couldn't put it down!"
3,Good for a while,"I have had this switch for a year and nine months. This past month I started to notice that one of my computers (and not the same one everytime) would just randomly lose the connection to the network. I would get ping fails, etc. I tried everything until I decided to power cycle the switch then everything worked. Couple days later, it happened to another computer and this time I powered cycled the switch first, and that fixed it. This happened several more times until I RMA'd the switch to NetGear. I had to pay the postage to netgear, but they sent me back what appears to be a new switch in a shrink wrapped box. I just got it yesterday, so it is too early to tell if this one will be more stable. Hopefully I can get more than 2 years out of it this time, considering I paid $200 for this thing."
1,Avoid this switch.,"It seemed like the best deal out there. 16 Gig ports for a great price. I own two of these, bought them together. Wish I could send them back, and Netgear just won't have anything to do with them. Within a couple months, they were locking up, dropping connections. I personally think its because these are fanless, and seem to overheat very quickly. I am amazed that Netgear thinks that a switch should be unplugged when not in use... a network switch is always in use.As far as performance goes, these switches are unable to sustain anything over 200Mbps. I am going back to linksys. Was getting over 500mbps sustained and never a lock up with even the cheapest linksys switch."
3,fails after a couple years,"Pros: Nice compact form factor, no fan noise, functions well before it fails.Cons: The power supply died after two years (the unit I bought warranties the power supply for only two years, so I was out of luck). Got it going again using a high quality replacement power supply. Now, a few months after that, no more gigabit connections, and other connection problems. Found out that the Netgear GS switches suffer from electrolytic capacitor failures after a couple years (also see reviews of GS108). Got it going again after soldering in new higher-rating capacitors. We'll see how long it goes from here.Other Thoughts: I suppose many people might expect ~ 2 years from non-enterprise grade switches, but I was hoping for better from this unit. Mine is an early version with 5 yr. warranty (2yr power supply), I hear the newer ones are lifetime."
5,Very good product,Got it managing 10 nodes of intense traffic (mostly to an Access database) and its been doing great. Network speed increased up to 5 times using Intel and Netgear's network adapters. No problem uplinking or with mixed 100 and 1000 mbps computers working at the same time.
4,Still going...,"I bought this saw about 3 years ago for a Christmas project. I didn't figure on using it much after that, but over the years I've put it to weekly use. I've used it on everything from 2x fir to 1x oak and it has handled it all very well. I use the high quality Bosch blades on mine and it really makes a difference. Maybe some day this saw will wear out and I'll get a high-end model, but it doesn't show any signs of wearing out. It's a good saw for $..."
3,OK for scrolling,"I've had this saw for about 10 years now. It's noisy and underpowered, and it vibrates a lot, especially with wider blades, and the footplate is cheesy stamped metal. But with a thin scrolling blade installed, it makes nice curved cuts. Beats the living heck out of a coping saw.For fun, I drilled a couple of holes in the footplate and mounted it under a hunk of plywood to use as a poor man's scroll saw.A thoroughly average tool, better than the current crop of B&D; saws that have the plastic wheel for tightening the footplate. It needs a little more amperage, a roller guide, and a better footplate."
1,WARNING! This is NOT Kevin James the Comedian,"Honestly I didn't even listen to it after the first 3 seconds.I expected Kevin James the comedian NOT A COUNTY SINGER!!!If you like that you might like it or you might not, again I didn't listed because I don't listed to country music other than Jonny Cash."
1,stupid game!,"don't waste your money on this game! I love the rugrats but can not stand this game. I am 11 and can't get past level 2! It doesn't have a thing to do with the movie or the show. there is something on the second level that you have to find, but i can't find it. and you can't save it, like donkey kong or toy story racing for game boy color. I recomend that you should get tiny toons: babs big break. that is a really fun game. on this game, you can't choose your character or anything. I don't recomend it for any one who is under 14 or who hates frusterating games."
1,A touch of envy!,"It's impossible to understand why such a very poorly written and long-winded diatribe could have made it to press. This book is no more than a collage of information, better written by biographers preceding Mr. Harris. Awful does not even begin to describe the book's lack of journalistic bearing. Barbed comments abound which instead of shedding light on the book's subject matter, seem to be included to ridicule its subject.Instead of delving deeper into the life of Mr. Grant, belabors whatever industry gossip he unearths and uses this unsubstantiated information to propel paragraphs of his own personal musings. He poses rhetorical questions, which with a little bit of research on his part could have been answered factually, the rhetorical query causally becoming completely moot."
3,Not a desk reference for programmers on the go...,This book is missing programmer terms. It just includes buzzwords and so forth. It is not a unified index on MS developer technologies. I kindof feel silly that I thought it was going to be such.
4,Would be 5 stars..........had to minus 1 star for lack of good lyrics.,"From the intro to the end this album is a good listen. Just like in the ""Golden Era"" I do not find myself skipping any tracks on this cd.The lyrics exhibited by the Quas MC aren't the tightest rhymes but the beats back him up quite well. The topics coverd generally are weed, women, & beats. The album is extremely comical.Be prepared to have the dopest/craziest beats you ever heard interupted. But rest assured the next song will be just as creative as the previous. I believe that he cut up the album to compensate for the weak but tolerable rhymes. Regardless of the lyrical ability of Quas, my digust w/the current Rap scene helps me appreciate a cd like this one.This is where Hip Hop needs to be.....These days most MC's and producers would be afraid to drop a cd like this 1. This album is futuristic and @ the same time reminds me of the originality of the 90's Hip Hop."
3,Not as good as the Unseen,The Unsen is my favrite hiphop/rap album of all time. This is not as good plain n' simple. It has some good beats here an there but mostly its boring. Quasimoto sounds as if he finally reached puberty on a few of these traks. But on others his voice is as high pitched as it was before. Sloppy voice manipulation 'Lib? Perhaps... Its good but it's not classic like the Unseen.
5,A Classic Hiphop album in 2005?,"Holy sh?!t. This album is another classic from Quasimoto/Madlib/Stones Throw. After the first listen, I thought that Madlib and his alter ego had fried too many brain cells from the Unseen and lost all what made him good the first time. But after I prepared some green for the second listen, I realized that this album is even better than the Unseen. Don't go by what you think of this album throught the first listen, or sober. Listen to the album more than once, puff some green and place this album next to the Unseen and various Tribe called Quest albums as true classics."
2,Too bad so sad,"Listen to the other dudes telling you that this is not a great album. ""The Unseen"" was super tight, this is pretty whack. Some decent beats, but the whole album is chopped up into little tiny bits and there is almost no flow through the whole thing. Songs could have been dope if they had lasted longer and not been cut up so bad. Really disappointing. You can't be perfect all the time."
1,Useless as delivered,"Doesn't hold. Bought it as replacement for original clip that came with headset, but this one does not hold firm to the headset cord. The device ""attaches"" in two places. One clip is the alligator clip that attaches to your shirt, and that clip is great, works perfectly. But the part where the clip attaches to the headset cord is not strong enough to hold firmly to the cord. As a result, the headset cord slides throught the clip and the weight of the cord pulls the headset tight on your head, which is what the clip is supposed to prevent in the first place.So IMO, absolutely worthless, as is. In order to get it to function, made one wrap of tape around the phone cord at the spot I wanted the clip to stay, then reverse wraped the tape so it stuck to itself with the sticky side out. Now the clip would actually grab. Not the end of the world and more trouble then it was worth to send back, so I didn't bother. But annoying that it didn't function out of the box."
2,Needs Spring,The button isn't spring loaded so it doesn't hold the cord in nearly as well as it should. Really doesn't do what it's advertised to do. Probably need to pass this one over.
4,Not for mobile headphones!,"Like some of the other reviewers, I find that this clip does not perform very well with mobile headsets/earbuds because the spring grip does not hold even a thick earbud cord tight enough to keep the cable from slipping through it. I solved it by doubling the cord and putting the loop back over the clip, but I have some trepidation about doing this because I don't know if it's going to stress the cord and cause the wire to break inside. This clip is really designed for an intercom headset cord, such as we use in television. Those cords are between 1/8"" and 3/16"" in diameter, MUCH thicker than consumer headphone cords. For these, this clip works perfectly, hence the four star rating. It performs well in the role it was designed for. If you are looking for something to use with your iPod or MP3 player headphones or cell phone headset, you probably want to look elsewhere."
3,lightweight but only helps some...,It helps keeps your earplug cord slightly out of the way while running etc but the cord will still shift from time to time requiring you to re-adjust it. it isn't heavy so it doesn't weight the ear plugs down which is good.
1,does not work,The clip has a major flaw; it doesn't work both the device that hold the cord slips and the clip that holds onto your cloths falls off. A complete waste of money
2,No good for Bose ear buds.,This was going to be a replacment clip for my Bose ear buds. It turns out the cable holder is to big and is probably to big for most ear buds.
3,big and bulky,Pretty big and bulky. Not a fan of its design. I'm afraid that the moving spring will break at one point. i stopped using it and got one that was smaller and had less moving parts.
3,Doesn't hold the cord tightly enough . . .,"Very strange! When I first got this product, it seemed to work just fine. It held my extra headphone cord in place tightly -- even during trail runs and runs in the wind and rain. But just lately, I noticed that the mechanism that clamps the cord isn't cinching down as far, and the cord slides through almost completely freely. (And yes, I've checked for foreign debris, etc.)Very disappointing. Trying to find a different one now. (Or upgrade to some bluetooth headphones, forgoing wires altogether.)"
4,Works great,"I have to attach it to the double-cord portion of my UE 350's (spring piece is too big to hold just one strand), but it holds just fine and clips securely to my shirt."
2,Not great!,"Bulky!!! I wish I could find a simple clip like the one that came with my ear pods. This one is less than ideal. I will keep using it, but only until I find ear pods with an included clip."
5,Expensive but worth every penny,"I use in-ear monitors and headset microphones for a living. I've always depended on the rather crappy clips that came with the equipment. I finally decided to look around to see if there were better alternatives. These were the most expensive ones I'd seen, but they seemed worth a try.They are fabulous. The spring-loaded cord holder makes installation a snap, and they swivel on the clip freely. I was a little worried about the cord holder slowly cutting my mic cable, so I put a layer of gaff tape around the cable, before I eventually put on the cord clip.Worth every penny."
2,"WEight Watchers Make It in Minutes: Easy Recipes in 15,20, and 30 Minutes","Beautiful-looking cookbook, but recipes are made mostly with unusual things that I never have on hand. I was disappointed."
2,You better have a well stocked cupboard,"I purchased this book in hopes that it would give me quick WW meal ideas. Unfortunately, the ideas were as obscure as they were quick. You will need to make multiple trips to the store for the ingredients required for many of the recipes. What good is it to have a ""quick"" recipe if you have to make a special trip to the store for the ingredients? Does that not defeat the entire purpose? There are good WW cookbooks out there, but this one is not one of them."
2,Not so great,"This book is filled with fast ideas, but most are not practical or appealing. I am disappointed and will probably not use the book all that much. The recipes are not generally husband or kid friendly as far as likeablility goes."
2,No comfort food recipes,"I was very disappointed that this cookbook didn't have more comfort food recipes. It used ingredients that you wouldn't normally have on hand. I was looking for recipes for meatloaf, mac & cheese. I won't buy another cookbook that I can't review first."
4,Lots of recipes!,I've only made one meal so far from this cookbook and it was pretty good! There are a lot of recipes but not much for breakfast items.
1,Who eats this stuff?,"Very disappointed in this cookbook. I was looking for some simple meal solutions that were healthy for my family but we're just not a ""chutney"" or ""ragout"" kind of group.Hope I can unload this on someone."
5,"Quick, Tasty, and Easy","The book has many quick recipes which are tasty, and my husband loves quick recipes (He does the cooking). We have picked our favorites of the ten we have tried so far, but haven't even begun to try all of them. We hope to eliminate beef in our diets, because most of the recipes call for chicken, or no meat, and include vegetables which we need more of. I'm glad I made the purchase."
2,"Make It in Minutes: Easy Recipes in 15,20,and 30 Minutes","This is the first Weight Watchers cookbook in which I've been disappointed. The first recipe we made had several inaccuracies including, The fat count, the calorie count, the point count. In addition the recipe was too dry and the product if made according to directions, and we did that, was not edible. I think that for the first time Weight Watchers trusted someone else with the responsibility for accuracy in one of their books and their trust was misplaced. I was further disappointed when I discussed the problem with the leaders where I bought the book and they were totally unconcerned and held Weight Watchers blameless in the book's errors. I expected the organization to accept responsibility for publications which are published in their name and sold in their establishments."
5,More deliciousness from Weight Watchers,"I can't say enough good things about Weight Watchers recipes. They're delicious, and can be served for anyone at any time. Whenever I cook for someone else I get only accolades. This book is no exception, many easy to make recipes that are tasty and healthy. The book arrived in a few days and it was just like new. Excellent condition."
4,Great Cook Book,"I just got my cookbook today. I have looked through it to see if any of the ingredients would be difficult to find, but it seems the recipes are easy enough and the ingredients sounds tasty.The only thing I don't care for is the fact that most of the recipes don't have photos. I am a visual person, so I like photos of what I am about to cook."
3,Cooking Fast Is too Complicated,"This little book contains some recipes that produce delicious dishes, but by the time I buy the ingredients that go into them, I haven't saved much time. The major problem with the book is its organization. It's difficult to find recipes by category. A second problem is that some of the recipes do take more time to cook than the book's title suggests.It's a good back-up, but it will not be my main cookbook."
3,WW easy recipes,I like this cookbook. The thing I don`t like about it is that the index should be more inclusive with all the recipes.
3,A disappointment,"The pictures of the book were attractive. However,as someone who has little patience in the kitchen, I found very few easy, quick recipes. Also, there were not enough ""no-meat"" recipes."
5,WW In Minutes,I love this cookbook! It couldn't be more simple and all of the recipes are delicious. This is actually the second time that I have bought the book. I loaned the first one to someone and they kept it!I have also given this book as gifts to fellow WW followers. It is also terrific for non WW people. My husband and 3 year old both love the recipes.I highly recommend!
4,"Some excellent recipes, others not-so-hot","I have made 6 recipes from this book so far. Two were absolutely delicious (and easy) and will be staples in my repertoire for years to come (Tofu Teriyaki and Pierogies with Creamy Mushroom and Sherry Sauce). Two were okay, but not great (Chicken Marsala and Soba Noodles in Ginger Broth)--when I make them again, I'll tweak the ingredients a little. Two were pretty bad (Honey Pecan Chicken and Eggplant and Tofu with Garlic Sauce).I rate this book 4 stars because I give it the benefit of the doubt. Many of the recipes seem appetizing and I am hoping the two duds were exceptions. Also, the two recipes that were good were REALLY good so they made up for the price of the book, even with the dud recipes. I think this is a worthy purchase if you're a busy person and need quick meals for weekday evenings, but just be aware that there are some bad recipes in here."
1,ElectroGalaxy.com should be renamed Shysters.com,"Ok, I was hasty in this purchase. At first glance it seemed a small price to pay for a camera case...about $14, shipping included. Then I got the camera case and found the dimensions somewhat lacking in the space requirement for the camera I ordered. You see, the dimensions listed under ""more details"" are for the outside of the case, not the inside (but it doesn't say interior nor exterior, just gives dimensions). Turns out, not only do you have to click ""more details,"" (fine print) you also have to click ""more technical details."" (finer print) Wish I had now. Just wasted $9 for shipping on a 6 oz camera case. ElectroGalaxy will not refund shipping charges, and they charge a %20 restocking fee. So, at most, after I pay return shipping, (the case is only $4) I might get back $2. So, yeah I was hasty, but I was also robbed."
1,Not satisfied,Even though this is the rcomended case for the camera it does not fit properly. You should not recomend this as the case for the MPVR.
1,Too Small,"This was recommended for a camera I bought at the same time, but when it arrived, it was WAY too small for the camera to fit in. Check sizes carefully or don't order this!"
5,Songs from the Heart,"James Ingram got my attention with ""One Hundred Ways""it's not just that he does great songs,it's not just that he has a great voice, it's the WAY he combines those 2 things. When tells me find one hundred ways I want to do that. When he asks ""How Do Wekeep The Music Playing""I want to know also. He inspires me when he sings ""Remember the Dream"" He encourages me when he sings""Whatever We Imagine"" My eyes start to tear on ""I don't HaveThe Heart"" ""Baby,Come To me""is a suggestion,not a plea, The sameway Luke handled Laura on General Hospital and it became theirlove theme. ""Somewhere Out There""transcends ""An American Tale""and is every person far apart from someone they love.The women on this recording(Linda Ronstat? and Patti Austin)add their voices from their hearts.ke"
4,Horizon Entertainment review of James Ingram's Greatest Hits,"If you like James Ingram, you will appreciate having this compilation of his greatest hits all in one place at your finger tips."
5,James Ingram The Greatest Hits,This album does contain Ingram's greatest hits! It sits among my best loved albums.
3,"not bad, but not great","this cd is full of some catchy tunes. but after you listen and try to get more into it the lyrics fall short.an example is ""and we all return to our roots""... very catchy... love the chick singing. but the words just don't seem to be cohesive. i keep trying to understand the urgency the chick is singing with during the chorus, but it just seems like they came up with a good melody and a good line, and even tho it didn't really tie into anything they used it anyway.unless i'm missing something.but after saying that, i'll say that... ""some things never change"" is an excellent song... but there are still some weak lyric moments in that one too.overall, generically good cd. i'd be very interested to see what their next cd is like. its good enough to sing along to, but it wont change your life."
5,Improvement Somehow on the last one!,"The single, Back to Our Roots is amazing and so beautiful. The CD as a whole seems to be an improvement and is great the whole way through. One of the top bands out there right now."
2,Laundry list.,"Not nearly as useful as I had hoped. There aren't differentials for everything, but hey who's perfect? The problem is that although they are arranged by anatomy, they seem too incomplete/random to use as a reference. And who has the time to read through and learn which differentials are actually useful? Most, unfortunately, are just laundry lists without embellishment, listing the incredible obscure sometimes above the common entities. And you'll need to make your own mnemonics. I thought this was a classic, but I think it's more of an antiquity. The google machine is probably more efficent. I'll give it two stars for great price, great condition (it was supposedly used, but looked perfect and shrink wrapped), and prompt shipping."
3,Not very sturdy,"If you're looking to buy a jigsaw, this isn't one that you want. You've got to put a lot of pressure on it to make the cuts. You have to be so careful when applying pressure not to lean to the side or else the saw will tilt and your line won't be straight. Even if you only want a jigsaw for around the house projects, don't buy this one. Spend a bit more money on a different brand."
5,Khartoum,"Charlton Heston plays the charmed, charismatic Gen. Charles Gordon and Sir Laurence Olivier is suitably menacing as the Mahdi in this thumping tale of the siege of Khartoum and the death of history's classiest fall guy. Great action sequences throughout: the assault on the city, the relief expedition, the attempt of the river steamers to run the Dervish gauntlet."
3,"The story is five stars but,,,,,","The sound is what my review is about. I was working at the Cinerama Theatre in West Hartford, Ct where this film was playing. It was shown in 70mm and 6 track magnetic sound. Why was the transfer only done in two channels?I have noticed lately the botched up transfers of magnetic film either 4 channel or 6 channel to DVD to be rather slopy. Doesn't anybody check this stuff before it's released to the public?I was very disappointed with the sound of this film. Why did they ever do away with flogging?"
3,"""Oh my beloved!""","A slick balanced production, Chuck plays a great Pom and Olivier a believable if a little under enthused cleric. Great production values, cleaned up a treat....just the ticket for a rainy Sunday afternoon....recommended"
3,Serviceable,"This is a decent movie about an interesting moment in African history. It's a bit too talky and dated looking. (I was watching LAWRENCE OF ARABIA recently, and that DOESN'T look dated, even though it was made in 1962. Khartoum was made in 1966, and DOES look dated.) Anyone who knows LAWRENCE OF ARABIA well, will spot points ""stolen"" from the LAWRENCE script that are in the KHARTOUM script (references to Gordon's vanity parallel in likeness a bit too closely the references to Lawrence's vanity in the respective movies). But the LAWRENCE influence was a positive one. It's an intelligent script. I saw Lord Kitchener's sarcophogous recently in St. Paul's Cathedral in London. So it was interesting to see this movie on that score. If it weren't based on an historical incident I was interested in, I think I would have liked the movie far less. But that it was ""educational"" makes me recommend it (if weakly) if you're interested in historical movies."
4,"New film to me, but I was not disappointed","I had never known that they made a film about this subject until I saw it sitting on the shelf at a local store. It was made well before my time, you see. But, being an avid history reader, and by coincidence, reading a book on the Victorian colonial wars at the time, I took a chance and bought it without having viewed it before. The previous reviews here flesh out the historical merits and flaws well, so the only thing I can say is that it does have that glossy, ""historical epic"" touch of 60's Hollywood, but is an all around solid film. Maybe it's not as strong as other epics of the time, but the casting and their subsequent performances are stellar. The film lacks a lot of the gritty violence of today's war films, and maybe it paints a bit of a naive, politically incorrect portrait of General Gordon, but overall, it's great, and I would recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in the topic, historical epics, or the actors involved."
3,"Provides useful info, but..","I thought this was the best book on this field until I got my hands on Herman Kruegle's CCTV Surveillance , Analog and Digital Video Practices and Technology, 2nd Edition which I would give 5 stars."
3,"Dated, but worthwhile watching","Shot in black and white and obviously a dated movie.I always wanted to see this movie because Eartha Kitt would appear in it.Not a very large role, as I discovered, but a nice one and she made the best out of it.The film is about Synanon house , and is in reality also an existing institute for drugaddicts.I found the story not really an exiting one, but it was shot in a beautiful wayThe black and white comes very strong and ads much to the total of the movie...All in all , still an interesting enough film to be seen more than once."
4,DVD Synanon,My tape finally came and it was finally sent.I hope that stays on time and keep up the good work. Frank
1,Are you kidding me!?!,"Are you kidding me! I have no review on this product, well because I don't even have it! It's been almost 2 months and I haven't even got it yet. Is there no contact number for Amazon? This is ridiculous and all the while my kitties are suffering, if you don't have it in stock don't advertise that you do."
4,One good Jig....,"I recently purchased the Jigsaw for my wife. I liked the fact that it came with blades,(so I didn't have to run out and get some). The case is nice and the Jig works great. We are very happy with its ability to make intricate cuts. The power (and the ability to adjust it) that you get for a few dollars more is worth it in my opinion."
3,Just Okay!,I bought this jig saw and returned it immediately. It is built okay but not strong enough to cut straight lines into plywood. I have a good circular saw but also want a lighter saw for cutting plywood once in a while when I have the circular saw not handy. It is great for cutting intricate shapes in not so thick wood. I want something that is heavy duty. Looks like I have no choice but to buy Bosch Progressor or similiar models. Don't get me wrong this is not a bad saw for its price.
1,NEED A STRAIGHT CUTTING JIGSAW-THIS ISN'T IT!,"Despite my new 4470 having a world of neat and nifty features and looking great, the bottom line for any jigsaw, is one that can cut straight. It is at that point, where this Skil gets off the train. It absolutely will not cut straight, with anything but the thinnest of materials. The blade immediately starts drifting off on a journey to the left. One must literally turn the entire saw to the left, about 10 degrees, to compensate and attempt a straight cut. I called Skil and on this saw, they offer a ""silent"" two year, no questions asked, replacement policy. What does that tell you? Do yourself a favor, skip all the Skil ""bells and whistles"" and low price and buy a Makita, Bosch, Porter Cable or Hitachi and save yourself a lot of aggrevation. My new Makita is on the way."
4,Pretty..,"This is a good size lamp, only reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that it has to be put together and is fragile, once that is done, it is really nice.."
1,"Fox=crafty, sly, or clever person, but...","...Fox-Lorber can be credited with sly only, for releasing this lack of quality even Madacy would be ashamed of.The 1 star is because of this release. Maybe they don't know yet that DVD technology allow for subtitles as a choice option, and maybe their budget was too short to get them right (one quarter is accurate, one quarter is approximate, one quarter is absolute fancy, and one quarter has escaped translation. But the worse is the (absence of) quality of the picture which is perfectly matched by a botched soundtrack.Until Criterion or some real professional in DVD business will take care of getting this released as it should be, better to avoid this one."
1,"BAD TRANSFER, BAD TRACK","I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw ""Lola Montes"", had made its way to DVD. I was so thrilled I couldn't get my money out fast enough. Of course, I took for granted that the negative had been restored and the telecine transfer had been made from a new 35mm interpositive on the Philips ""Spirit"". I also took for granted that the best audio facility would have been employed re-record the track of a film this important cinema history. Well, I was wrong on both counts and badly wrong at that. It's almost as though someone found a 16mm print that had been left outside in a garbage dump for twenty years and mastered it rather than go through the expense of restoring this masterpiece. It is simply the worst looking print and worst sounding track I have ever experienced on VHS or DVD. If you're hoping to see one of the world's great films beautifully restored and re-recorded, look somewhere else."
2,Ophul's Awful Offal,"Okay, it's not that bad, but I've been trying to upgrade the review titles lately and couldn't resist. Anyway, LOLA MONTES might carry the high cachet of a master's masterpiece, but I could barely keep my eyes on this story of the grand courtesan of Europe, Lola Montes, who left Liszt, loved King Ludwig, and wound up in the middle of a circus with Peter Ustinov wearing the tall silk and cracking a whip, the audience shouting out indelicate questions, and her life being replayed in a series of flashbacks. The lovely Lola, played by the monotonous Martine Carol, may have led a fascinating and compelling life, but it failed to generate a spark with me.The thing does look good though, as far as I could tell. Nice framing, editing, layers of action, that kind of stuff. When this Fox/Lorber dvd wasn't showing off its scratches and flares it was fluttering across the screen. Even with a pristine print and a perfect transfer, though, I don't think I'd care to sit through this one again."
1,Still Lousy After All These Years,"The issue isn't whether this or that transfer is better or worse: this is a bad film that no amount of after-the-fact tinkering can save. Not even the great Ustinov can rescue this sprawling, miserable mess. The acting is cloyingly annoying, the story telling lurches like a carriage missing a wheel, the title role is filled by an actress who could put hummingbirds to sleep, and the music is like having a cream pie pounded into your ear. The crowds and critics were right the first time when they declared this film a flop upon its initial release. It's still a flop."
2,Not the whole story!,"Having taken a day trip to Nevada City, Ca., I was surprised to learn that Lola Montez had lived there and the house is still standing. There are also a couple of plaques in the town commemorating her living and entertaining there. Since I was pretty fascinated about her life and ended up reading alot about her life. Unfortunately the movie does not show her life at all in California and only mentions it. This was the main reason I rented it on Netflix but was very disappointed with it. I think someone out there could do a much better job. I realize this was in France in the 50's but it was done way too artsy and symbolic."
3,NOT A PERFECT FILM,"THE WHOLE STORY WAS REALLY HOLLOW, BUT THE DESIGN AND THE HANDLE OF THE WHOLE ELEMENT WAS TRULY UNFORGETTABLE AND AT HIGH-LEVEL. WATCH IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE TOP FILMS TO."
5,So convenient,When you work in a team this is the best product to have to load up presentations and make quick compilations. I love it!
3,it's good for teacher to prepare class,"It's not a propriate bood for beginer to study NMR knowledge, but good for teachers to prepare class teaching materials."
2,THIS is CASTLEVANIA!?,"No it isn't. This is a standard platformer with extremely sluggish control, no secondary weapons, and slow movement. Plus, your whip loses power each time an enemy hits you. This is a pain. The saving grace is that you can obtain a whip that shoots fireballs and the first stage has GREAT music. But that can't save the game. Even CastleVania fans should steer clear of this one."
4,Great classic game!,"I don't understand the negative reviews of this game; yes, it requires precise jumping and your whip gets downgraded if you get hit but whip upgrades are commonplace enough that you should be able to maintain your upgraded whip throughout the game, as long as you're not getting hit every 5 seconds. To rate a game poorly because it's a little difficult doesn't make sense to me. Overall it's a great game; fun and challenging."
1,Worse than the 64 Castlevania's...,"This is a completely dumbed-down version of Castlevania- Belmont has NO abilities in this! No jumps or charges, no use of weapons like the axe or cross, not even whip-spinning. There is horrible slowdown when there are more than two enemies on screen at once, which is surprising given how simple the game is. It also lacks any kind of level progression like pass codes, so you start at the beginning every single time you play. This is a flat-out terrible game, it is not even worth the few dollars to buy it."
4,i sent it back.,"This was a good knife. If you are looking for a chef's knife that is balanced and light,though, this knife is very heavy, and probably will wear out your wrist. It would still be a good chef's knife,and might even work as a cleaver. I also had to send it back because this 10 inch knife is too big for a regular kitchen. I'm going to get a 9 inch instead."
2,Not What I Expected,"This strap is comfortable, but doesn't fit all guitars and basses. If your strap button is one of the smaller/medium sizes, this should work for you. The whole strap-lock does not work. Thhe ends are plastic, and quikly broke. I would recomend this strap for someone who does not play on a daily basis."
1,Cheap - and it shows.,"You get what you pay for. This strap screams cheap and stays that way. It only fits guitars with narrow barrel buttons and the ""locking"" mechanism is nothing more than two pieces of thin plastic that ""bend"" around the barrel. One of mine broke off after a half-dozen uses. Even the fabric is the worst I've ever seen. If you like the concept of a locking strap, I strongly suggest you check out the Planet Waves version - it's miles ahead of this in design and execution.Planet Waves 2-inch locking Guitar Strap - Barbed Wire"
1,"Horrible product, deserves zero stars!",Don't waste your money on this. I wish you could say you get what you pay for but even at this low price you don't get your money's worth.I didn't even get one use out of this strap. The attachment is made out of flimsy plastic. If your strap button isn't exactly the right size the plastic is going to break. If your button is the right size I can't imagine this flimsy piece of plastic is secure enough to hold your guitar securely.The only way a guitar strap could be worse is if it didn't have any holes for your guitar buttons. But then at least you wouldn't have to worry about your guitar falling off the strap.This is quite honestly one of the worst products I have ever purchased.
1,Is there a zero stars option?,"I guess there isn't but if there was that's what I'll give to this crap. Really bad quality material, I just didn't dare to use it because I was so affraid that this thing would break for sure. Just don't buy it!!"
5,Great romantic comedy,I was really pleased to see this was released on DVD. Starring a very young and lovely Gene Tierney and Henry Fonda as her likeable beau this story of con artists spinning their web takes some hilarious turns. Spring Byington and Laird Cregar are great as the sneaky duo who use Tierney's charms to swindle young men. There are a number of tense moments that leave you routing first for the con men then for the sweethearts. It would be very hard to dislike this one if you are into romantic comedies or any of the primary actors. It has to be one of Gene Tierney's best early roles.
4,Hippy Alt Rock Rules!,"Very nice record. I really enjoyed the whole album except for the last two live tracks (which were reeeaaallly drawn out despite J's excellent guitar playing). I prefer the more acoustic songs to the more drawn-out electric ones. Sideways is very beautiful, and so is Quicksand. I loved the evil-sounding bass and punkness in The Little Baby, though."
4,pretty good for mid-year CD,This CD was pretty good for J mascis. The songs were great. Some were amazing like quicksand and pebbles weeds. Thumb was a neat little live show but keep the glove didnt interest me.
4,A great not-well-known EP for D. jr fans. Good Stuff.,"""Whatever's cool with me"" is the last EP that Dinosaur Jr. put out in their original style. Before ""Green Mind"", life of D. Jr. was relegated to a sound that ended here. J's Neil Young experience is most noticeable in the song, ""Pebbles and Weeds"", one of D. Jr's best"
4,Dinosaur Jr.,"What can I say? One of the best CD's from the heyday of J. Mascis' career. The best version of ""Thumb"" I've heard to date. If you're a Dinosaur Jr. fan, you already have this CD. If you're just getting into them, you need this CD."
4,pretty darn good,"there are some great tracks here, particularly byAretha Franklin adn Laura Lee........................"
2,Teenagers are tiresome,"Petsinis takes a very interesting topic -- the short career and life of boy-genius Evariste Galois -- and surrounds it with flowery mathematical language. Probably the most interesting narrative ideas are presented in the first, er, Chapter Zero, but similar attempts later in the book are nearly incomprehensible. By then, Evariste has determined to make himself a martyr for the Revolution, a much drier concept then dying for mathematics. As his Republican comrades complain, Evariste becomes tiresome.Nevertheless, I have picked up a couple of books on mathematical history: the politics of France at the time of Galois and the politics of academic mathematics are fascinating."
3,OK movie,"After reading the other review for this movie i would have to agree that it's a little unrealistic...but that's what makes the movie so much fun! And the guy that plays the killer is gorgeous!! Actually, i was switching around the stations on TV and only started watching the movie because of how cute he is...So, maybe the acting and plot aren't that great, but have you seen Center Stage? The only reason people watch that is for the cute guy...and let me tell you, this guy is a hottie."
2,You need to be hoodini,"Impossible to put on and take off independently without help from another person. I ordered another one a size bigger and still very tight. The elastic trim at the bottom of the shirt doesn't stretch much, therefoe making it difficult to don and doff."
5,Suprise Hit!!!,"The storyline of this movie is not only romantic and sweet but it's also hilarious. I mean Anthony Michael Hall is in the movie, what do you expect? This romantic comedy is basically about the main character Josh played by Anthony Michael Hall who has absolutely ""no game"" when it comes to women. So his thoughtful single friends decide to give him a makeover and transform him into a wanted eligible bachelor. Despite their endless efforts, Josh is not interested in just any girl-he has his eyes set on Doreen who is out of his league. But nothing stops Josh from getting the girl of his dreams......even if it means just being himself."
4,Grab your popcorn and enjoy the show....,"I recently viewed this romantic comedy some years ago and just recently purchased it online to view again with my husband. He normally is not a big fan of romantic comedies, but enjoyed this one more than most. The beginning of the story line starts off a little slow and at first seems to be going nowhere. It quickly picks up and becomes apparent that it was all necessary in developing the characters. You can not help but fall in love with the main characters who are perfectly cast in their roles. Their chemistry is terrific and the story line genuine. Anyone who has ever been in love will relate to the range of emotions that accompany a true love, all of which are portrayed in this story. This comedy will have you laughing, crying and wanting more."
4,Look At Anthony Michael Hall in a New Light!!!,"I have to say that at the beginning of this movie, I thought it was a wawste of money. However, I quickly changed my mind as I was seeing Anthony Michael Hall really sink into the ""leading man"" role. Hoaving grown up on his 80's films, he has not only grown up physically, but he has a huge range when it comes to acting and I really hope he does more movies, especially as a leading man. There are some parts of the movie I would deem unneccessary to the plot, but in the end it was Hall's performance that truly saved this movie!"
4,Adorable and great for V-day,"Funny Valentine is an adorable love story with the back drop of hilarious sidekicks. Josh ( Anthony Michael Hall to all of you who grew up in the 80s ) isn't exactly the best in the girl department. He has two crazy friends who never have any trouble getting girls who try to give him a ""make-over"" of sorts. They try to change him well...into them. But that's not what he wants. He doesn't want one night stands with girls he doesn't really like and may never see again. He wants one certain girl, but she's one of those typically jaded, single-mom types who isn't about guys at the moment. To make a long story short, he uses his own way of going about things and eventually gets the girl. Love prevails without a doubt."
1,Worthless piece of Chinese junk!,"My grandson got this rifle for his birthday. Of course, he wont let us send it back, even though there is no way for it to fire either roll or push-on caps. The hammer is hard for a child to pull back and pinches little fingers. The trigger does snap the hammer but not hard enough to fire a cap. Overall, this is another example of a misrepresented import that fails to meet expectations. I would get a refund if my grandson would let me!"
2,Very disapointed,I had purchased this for my 6 yr old son but had to return it.Poorly packaged for shippingpoor paint jobwood chipped in 2 placesWas not going to pay for something that looked so beat up and poorly made.Had no difficulty with getting a refund from Amazon.
2,Just for show,"This toy gun is for show and that's about it, might be good for a prop, that's about it. Say's it fires roll cap's. Good luck with that one."
5,Great product.,This product was great for dipping pretzels for my diabetic family and friends for the holidays. . I will purchase again.
4,Pretty Good,"Well, this CD is clearly better than Vol 1 LHTS. That was too poppy, and the only standout song on that CD is ""Wonderful"". But this CD is much better. The first song, ""When It All Goes Wrong Again"", is a contrasting song to the first real song of LHTS, ""Here We Go Again"". ""Babytalk"" is a good song, and ""Rock Star"" is the second-best song. I really don't like ""Short Blonde Hair"" and ""Misery Whip"" too much. ""Out of My Depth"" is by far the best song on here, and my favorite. ""Good Witch of the North"" isn't that good. ""Halloween Americana"", the music song, is okay, but not great. ""All F***ed Up"" has great music, the fast pace is very nice. Only if the lyrics were better...""Overwhelming"" belongs on LHTS; its a wimpy-poppish song. The last track, ""Songs From an American Movie Pt. 2"", is much better than its predecessor. It sounds nice, and has some good music. So overall, this CD is pretty good."
3,Not Everclear's Best,"I May Be The Only One Who Does'nt Like When It All Goes Wrong Again, I Do Like Rock Star, Out Of My Depth, And Song From An American Movie Part 2. That's Enough To Get 3 Stars."
5,"A Cool Gift For Someone, & BETTER THAN ECCO","AS A FATHER, I BOUGHT ""Ariel: The Little Mermaid"" FOR MY DAUGHTER BACK IN '95... LOOK, I THINK IT'S BETTER THAN ""Ecco."" CUTE, DEFINITELY FUN, CHALLENGING TOO, AND I GIVE IT OVERALL A+. BELIEVE ME (as a Sega Game Collector) EVEN THE GUYS ARE GONNA LIKE PLAYING THIS!"
2,What's this? Live???,"This must be the DVD that was launched in Brazil under the title ""O velho amigo"" (the old friend). The Director is the same. I was very disappointed with it, too, like one of the other reviewers. It doesn't have much footage of Baden playing. The title ""Live"" is deceiving. It's just a documentary and a bad one at that. A film of a live concert would have been much better."
5,Love it,I usually can't sleep well so I try the valerian root tea and work but the taste was horrible so I try the drops and it is much better I recommend the liquid drops much better it works great
4,good product,"I put a few drops of this in some chamomile tea and honey at night, read a bookand I fall right to sleep. Seems to work well. It does have a funky smellbut that's valerian. It dissipates."
2,Save Your Pennies,"The songs on this record are all well written and sound like they would be great live, but here they lack energy and sound so flat that you will be bored with the CD within a few spins. Courtney Love is still the girl with the most cake."
1,The Hohner Koch Harmonica,"Upon trying out this harmonica, I immediately detect a problem on the very first reed. As if it were stuck. Sounded like a cow in labor. I contacted the seller, ""Total Music Source"" and they have been great! They emailed a label enabling me to mail it back at no cost to me, and obliged my request that the harp be repaired. It is currently back in Germany for repair. No fault of the seller. I believe the problem may be quality review (or lack thereof) at the Hohner factory. This is the 2nd Hohner chromatic that I have ordered that had the same problem. The first one was not from the same seller, by the way. That first one, I returned for full refund. I believe the situation will be resolved successfully by the Total Music Sourse team."
3,Honer Koch Tuned Chromatic is ok: Amazon is GREAT!,"I have been playing diatonic harmonicas in the Blues Genre for many years and decided to try a Chromatic harmonica. The lower 4 notes are tuned diatonic.This harmonica isn't very as air tight, the slide sticks once in a while, and the diatonic notes sometimes don't vibrate well. Honer is sending me some tips. The price was quite a bit lower than MSRP and the sound is fairly generic, even though I am able to bend notes better than expected, the lower notes are hard to draw at times. Amazon had it delivered as promised.Meanwhile, I am still using my diatonics more often."
5,"Awesome drill, Great Circ Saw","Have now used this kit quite a bit while building a shed from scratch.The drill is incredible. Great power, flexibility, balance and battery life. I have managed to break one of the two included bits, but I replaced it at the hardware store for 89 cents. The drill itself seems solid and well built, even after a lot of use.The circ saw is powerful enough and well balanced, but battery life can be an issue if you don't plan your charges in advance.The recip saw is nice enough and well balanced, if a little heavy (I had to do some tight cutting above my head and holding it up there was a little tiring after a while).The flashlight? Well, it just sits there. I suppose it would be ok, but usually both of my batteries are taken, either by a tool or the charger.The standout here is really the drill, followed by the circular saw. The fact that I don't have to drag a cord around is simply wonderful, and the 18v tools provide more than enough power for the things I do."
1,TRASH,"this is a piece of crap don't buy it. the one i got looked like it was found at the bottom of the dead sea. when i tried to play it i could only get one note, and afterward my teeth hurt. i hope i don't have rabies. if you really want one of these, you can have mine, it's somewhere towards the bottom of the trash can."
1,Horrible!,"Got this for my wife, came on time and everything but wow one of the worst smelling perfumes ever! She hated it, and the little squirt she put on gave me a headache!!"
2,Blurs and cuts. Too bad!,"Nice story however if there is one thing I don't like about movies is ""rewriting"". That's when they change the language or blur parts of it or cut parts of it. A big no no in my book!!!"
5,Its better than Dragon Slayer. . .MUCH BETTER,This is the best Toy I've ever got my son. He Combines it with the Man-O-War set he has and he really loves to play with it. This toy can last long like most Mega Blocks toys. Its fun and it relates to things in myths and true things. Go to megablocks.com then to products then to 5= then to Dragons. You cant miss it!
2,"Good for show, poor building design","I had bought this set for my little brother. Since he could not build it himself, I had to help. I was frustrated at how long it took for me to build it, without it falling apart every once in a while. The quality of pieces of megabloks just pale in comparison to LEGO. My brother really enjoyed the dragons and the figures, but would break the stronghold every time he tried to battle in it. In conclusion; good dragons and minifigures but a bad design and connection."
1,Evidence and Procedures,"This book has some great information if you're studying to be a surveyor, bu the price is so friggin ridiculous I simply cannot recommend it. Unless your class reads from it weekly or you have exercises directly from the text - skip it."
3,The darn things keeps coming apart!,"Okay, this car is in two pieces...the first part is the base which has the wheels attached to it and then it's the shell part which is the body of the car. These two things CONSTANTLY come apart so every two minutes I have my son tugging at my sleeve to fix his car. I'm going to super glue the darn car together so it will stay in one piece! Too pricey for this problem to be happening...it's not an item from the dollar store! Wait until it goes on clearance."
1,Worst auto book I have ever read,This book is strictly an advertisement for Painless Wiring and contains no info that you would not read in Painlesswiring's instruction book. Every chapter tell you how to install their product. What a waste of money
4,"Great, but not what I ordered....","Great product, however it seems that I did not receive an adjustable NPA. Instead of the orange one in the product description I got a green one- which is not adjustable. I mean- an NPA is an NPA. Good product, just now what was described."
5,A Classic,"Released over ten years ago, Screamadelica still sounds fresh today. To these ears it stands as one of the best albums released in the ninties. However, looking at it on paper it looks like it should have been a total failure. Primal Scream had been a noisy rock band who suddenly veered into dance music. Equal parts techno, gospel, circa 68 Stones and spacey dub, it move in several different directions, yet somehow manages to cohere. There is no shortage of great tracks, with MOVIN' ON UP(gospel meets Let it Bleed Stones), STEP INSIDE THIS HOUSE(techno cover of the 13th Floor Elavators!), DAMAGED(like a long lost bluesy outtake from Beggar's Banquet), LOADED(cool Peter Fonda sample) and HIGHER THAN THE SUN(ambient dub worthy of The Orb)among the standouts. Released the same year as Nirvana's Nevermind, this release stands at least as tall as that seminal album. In time it may even eclispe it!"
5,Great Trip Hop Landmark,"This is it, the album where psychedelia, techno and blues rock all blend together in one blissful mix. This is also one of the best albums I've ever heard just for the sheer variety of styles that can be found. Most of the tunes are very trip hop oriented then there are the blues rock flavorings that resemble the Stones at their peak. This was the exact opposite end of the musical spectrum back in the 90's when, in the U.S., the grunge scene was in full swing. In the U.K. this album was a big hit but it didnt make quite that big of a splash over here in the states as we were engrossed in Cobain and company. But this album deserves more attention than it has received, its one of the most original albums I've ever heard, true it may be a mish mash of familiar genres but the way its all put together and heard sounds brand new. Anyways highly reccomended!"
5,definitely top 10 albums of the 20th century,"Primal Scream will never be remebered as a great band but this album WILL be remembered. Every song on here is immaculately crafted and is catchy, sweeping and original. Nothing quite like it. If there is any criticism, it would be that song no.1 doesn't fit stylistically on the album and would have made a great closing number instead. But that's just knitpicking.Buy this album, the play it over and over, occasionally interspersed with the Beatles' Revolver and the Stone Roses first album.A must for any serious collection."
3,Not for everybody,This album is without doubt one of the defining albums of the past ten years- and the weirdest.The band were off their rockers on speed making it. It is very inconsistent exploring many different genres of music and feelings.Even though i appreciate the art and genius of the album i cant say that i honestly enjoyed it but it is an intersing listen.
4,Great inspiring stuff!!!!!,"It's all about felling(s), sounds, and melody.It tears dsown walls built by thoose who want their popmusic in a strict form..It takes one look at the pop/rock musics book of rules and tear it apart forever!!! Popmusic should always be right here, right now! And it caputered the early 90's movement so magnificilly!! It's the beat of it's time, now, and the future! Timeless!!!"
5,Still good after so many listens,Just a brilliant relaxed trippy feel to this album- play someone a couple of songs and see if they can guess the year it was released. And Bobby Gillespie's voice goes so well over a Sitar...
4,"IF YOU LIKE MUSIC, JUST BUY IT","The album gives me some real stuff of music. If you are tired of maintream or so-called alternative, just try this one. Distinctive, origial, creative, innoventive. It keeps you relax deep and think deeper, ..."
5,Two of the best,"One of the best reissues on vinyl I have and I have over 100,One of the best Primal Scream records ever made. You don'tneed to know anymore if you have it on CD buy the vinyl ifyou don't have it get it on vinyl."
5,Movie Reviews,Screen World 57 is a valuable collectors item for the movie buff to the film afficiaado. It contains reviews of every major film released in the U. S. and abroad. I have purchased this book every year since 1972. I wonder what this collection could be worth?
4,A Yearbook to Remember,"If movies are your thing (and they are mine) this is the book to get to remind you of the past year in movies. We are talking indies, foreign, b movies and of course Academy Award winners. Volume 57 already? Can't wait for #58!"
1,Really Disappointing,"There weren't any reviews of this headset available when I purchased it. I have owned many different gaming headsets in the past and this is by far the lowest quality headset I have ever purchased. The mic has been the major problem. You have to place it nearly in your mouth to be audible. I have tested it with different applications and computers with the same results. The adjustment on the left earpiece no longer locks in place and completely slides up and down. I hate buying products where it is completely obvious that the manufacturer was trying to maximize profits while completely disregarding their product quality. I would estimate $5 in electronics, $5 in materials, $5 in manufacturing & packaging. Thanks SteelSound, I now know what to expect in your products and will not be purchasing another one again. At least you saved me $100 on your mouse."
2,Lacks precision - no calibration adjustment,Can't recommend this saw for other than rough carpentry. Mine doesn't cut accurately to the preset detents and can't be calibrated as detents are factory milled. I would't buy another miter saw that did not have adjustable calibration. It is a real pain when making 2 mating 45 degree cuts in expensive stock and you put them together and get a 87.5 degree corner!
3,Prefer no Lyrics,"The CD was good, but I think the lyrics detract from the music, especialy considering that the songs in the show dont have any. Needless to say, the instrumentals were my favorite."
3,Trying Too Hard,"The first CD from the Blue Man Group, Audio, is one of my favorite CDs. After listening to Complex, however, I thought they were trying too hard to appeal to a broader audience. By incorporating vocals, they branched from their true talent to bring more classic rock to the listener. I was disappointed with the vocals, but the music on some tracks make up for it. Overall, I enjoyed the album, but the vocals cost it for a music fan like me."
5,Am i blue?,"You're darn right i am! This is an album i passed up because of the 'professional' reviewers trashed it more often than not. I was drawn back again and again because of simple curiousity. I grabbed it, crossed my fingers, and placed it in my cd player. Unbelievable. Those critics,in my opinion, are dead wrong. Vocals, at least this time, DO add to the blue man group. These 'creations' are well crafted and colorful. So much fun to listen to. Their 're-do' of DONNA SUMMERS' ""I feel love"" was juiced up so strong that it actually overshadowed the original. So much power in this music. So much energy. And a nice selection of songs with incredible vocals. This is truly a great follow-up album from a group i will now stay true to with their every release. D*MN the critics."
2,overshadowed,"if you found yourself loving their studio album, audio, and are expecting more of the same, don't waste your money, or set yourself up for disappointment. in this release, the Blue Men i have come to love take a back seat, and give the lime light to artist who stand well on their own, but don't come close to the talent found in this trio who's name on the cover is overshadowed by those artist featured on this release. I bought this release for the Blue Man Group, not for artist using their talent to further their own career."
5,Excellent CD to listen to.,I love the music and listen to it almost daily when I drive to work or any where else.
3,Not at all happy,"I was very very excited to hear about this album, but after listening to the samples and reading the track list I'm not buying it. BMG is above having 'guest' vocalists and such taint their creations. I don't know if it's BMG thinking their last album is a fluke or if it's the 'guest' performers who have moved from playing with Santana onto something better, but either way, it's not the BMG of the last album. Not to mention atleast one track that has a preview, is that of a slightly remixed track from the first album. I'm severely disapointed. I gave the album 3 stars because it didn't seem fair to give it lower without hearing all of it. The 'guest' names alone ruined it. I enjoy BMG because it's totally 'instrumental'. If anyone from BMG reads this, please stick to the non-vocal and purely instrumental sound of the first album."
2,They are shaking up the rock world??,"It's just hard to believe that these guys have the nerve to say that rock needs a face-lift. It doesn't.I'm from the town that has pioneered great talent and this album isn't after you substract D. Mathews and all the other real musicians who play on this record. What's left is just PCV tubing best used by plummers.Signed,Sleepless in Seattle, WA"
4,Their own worst enemy,"While this album is satisfying on its own, it is no match for the first time seeing or hearing BMG. Their formula is largely retained, except for the obvious addition of vocals. Some of them feel like a stretch or a superfluous add-on, but they are not as distracting as I had feared. BMG remain propulsive, danceable, and intelligent --not too many bands of which this can be said. I'm really interested in how this all incorporates into a live show, and just what the performance/music mix is like. Maybe the hardest thing is having ANOTHER secret band ""discovered,"" like when David Byrne showed up on the cover of Time..."
5,Blue Man Group - The Complex Exhilarating,"After attending a performance by the Blue Man group in person, I was sold on finding this style of music and enjoying the experience at home. The CD mixes many of the show's music and some new innovations with vocal artists. The music has a magnificant beat, rhythum and allure that is great listening.I thoroughally enjoy the experience and recommend The Complex for any fan of music."
4,"Its definately good, but...","...its just not what I want to hear from Blue Man Group. I loved Audio because it DIDN'T have lyrics and vocals. The vocal tracks on this CD are good and still have that Blue Man Group sound, but I still prefer the non-vocal tracks on the album over them. Buy Audio before you buy this."
4,Put the sharpener at a good height,The drawer are kind of small and tend to stick a little but they are conveninant and water proof.What I like about this base is that it put the JET sharpener at a good height for me.
2,Goodbye Geese,This book is for ages 4-8 years old.It answers questions about what happens when winter comes and the geese fly south. It is a serious book and not very appealing to read more than a few times.I would not recommend buying this book unless you are a big fan of this author.
3,A classic game with issues,This is the original pack in game that came when you bought a Genesis before Sonic existed. It originated in the arcades and gained a huge following of gamers. However the game is extremely short and not quite varied anough to really keep your interest. I believe that casual gamer will find it boring and shallow. However collectors obviously must have this game duie to the history alone.Casual Gamer: Pass on this one!Collectors: Get it just to have.
4,good,a fun game that is imaginitively created. Along with great graphics(for the time it came out) you would have a fun and entertaining game that is worth playing over and over again.
4,"Extremely Short, fun while it lasts","It's about 15 minutes long, unless you have trouble trying to kick the blue buffalo, which they contain a power-up. When 3 power-ups are gotten, it will go into Beast Mode. Then, the next time you get to Neff in a level, it's time to battle. It's a whole new battle, you both another beast."
5,"Altered Beast, an exellent Sega Classic","Altered Beast is one of the best games you can have on your Sega Genesis. If you like becoming an ancient warrior who comes back from the dead to save the world, Altered Beast is for you. In this game you start off as a pretty average sized man, but by collecting some Pomer Ups your man soon becomes a HULKING Brut. Collecting 1 Power Up will make him medium sized and collecting 2 will make him bigger and bader than Hercules. Now this is the cool part, when you get the third Power Up your character morphs into an altered beast. But the funnest part of this game is in the 2 Player mode. To do this push the start button on the second players controler, and have fun with a friend."
4,Rise from your grave!!,"As appropiately titled this game is what launched the Sega Genesis/Megadrive's carrer. It has two famous lines in this 1989 classic. They are "" Rise from your grave "" and "" Welcome to your doom !"" You can hunt down the rare Genesis version or buy the Sega Genesis Collection.P.S I gave this a overall 4 stars because it is only five levels long."
4,"Luv,, luv, luv...",This bowl met every expectation and the only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it could have been twice as big and been even better. It looks handmade by a gnome or hobbit potter. Very sweet and magical. I'm so happy to be able to recommend it.
2,"Good on Fundamentals, Not So Good on Proofs","This book offers brief coverage of an impressive array of ""fundamental"" topics that are likely to come up in various later courses. The value here is that in most later (upper division) math classes there is a major benefit to knowing even a little of the material from some of the other upper division classes. On the other hand, this book simply will not help you learn how to do proofs. After going about half way through the book and working on the exercises, I realized that I was no better at doing proofs than when I began. The ""hints"" to the exercises in the back of the book are really no help at all for self study. I usually know the right strategy, what I really need to learn is the correct way to express my ideas as a proof, and this book does not provide very much guidance on how to do that."
3,Too long and wordy.,"The content is very good, but its explanation is too long and wordy. This made me so bored. Try ""How to Prove It: A Structured Approach"" by Daniel J. Velleman instead."
4,Good Book,"This undergraduate book was required in my math class. Self teaching with this book is not impossible, but rather difficult if you do not know all the mathematical symbols. Overall great book"
2,"Nice prose, not so nice mathematics.","I used this book for a transition course to higher mathematics and found it lacking.The positive aspects of this book are the friendly writing style and the wide variety of topics introduced that are essential to other higher mathematics courses. This book can serve as a nice introductory reference to ""refresh"" certain topics; it may also be used to spark interest in other interesting aspects of the field.However, the books friendliness was counterbalanced by being completely unhelpful in the exercises. I thought the exercises were completely unhelpful and what's worse unrelated to the examples given in the respective section. I would not recommend this book for someone looking to get an substantial introduction to abstract mathematics."
2,To long,I found this book to be long and drawn out. The chapters are very wordy and dont really get to the point.
5,Great Introduction to Knots,Very valuable for teaching kids and Boy Scouts about knots. It has the important ones. Also has the Ashton which is the most useful way in the world to tie a bundle. The truck knot (really it is several knots together) will tighten a line so much as to be able to pluck it. This book is a definite must buy.
1,Not alone nor in the Dark,I could not even give this movie a B rating. If there was a z rating that would still be too high. No one was either alone or in the dark. There were s few psychological cliches excusing criminal behavior which was obviously an attack against bleeding heart liberal sociologist but other than that I would have to classify this movie as a comedy.
1,"leave this one ""alone in the dark""","first off 1 star because you can't give no stars!! THIS IS ONE OF THE DUMBEST AND SILLY HORROR MOVIES EVER MADE . IT REALLY STINKS AND I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY BOTHERED TO PUT IT ON DVD. NOT SCARY,NOT FUNNY, JUST THE WORST!!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY ANYTHING BUT THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!"
4,Better Than It's Reviews,"This horror flick flew under the radar but don't let the negative reviews scare you off. I think it's better some of the so-called genre classics and definitely worth your time. If your expecting Shakespeare, you might be disappointed. Otherwise, you'll be in for a real treat!"
4,The Problem Is That You're NOT Alone...,"Four insaniacs: The Preacher (Martin Landau), Frank (Jack Palance), The Bleeder, and a 400lb. child-molester w/ the strength of 10 men, escape from the local asylum during a blackout. They cause havoc, murdering anyone unlucky enough to cross their path! Landau's character is my favorite, w/ his joker-like grimace of psychotic glee! Donald Pleasence (Halloween 1 and 2, Raw Meat) plays Dr. Bain, the man who believes these murdering kooks just need a hug and a good talking to. Needless to say, he is proven wrong. Dwight Schultz also stars as a Dr. who must protect his family from the home-invading lunatics! Carol Levy is the ill-fated Bunky. Directed by Jack Sholder (The Hidden). Entertainment value: High..."
3,Passable slasher stuff!,The story of escaped mental patients who terrorize a family during a blackout. Some scares and gore make this enjoyable enough.
1,Very campy in a bad way.,I thought it would be better because of the actors in it. I did not expect it to be great but it wasn't even good.I recommend you pass on this one.
3,horror fan,"After browsing the horror movie genre of amazon, I came across this movie. The reviews for it were all positive and I enjoyed Donald Pleasance in the Halloween series so I bought it. Boy was I dissappointed! Even though there were some good scares, it was more of a comedy than a horror. Was Donald Pleasance supposed to be the doctor or one of the patients, his role confused me at points."
4,A Notch above the typical 80's Slasher,"I was so glad to see this film finally get the DVD treatment. It's another one of those forgotten 80's slashers like ""Madman"" and ""The Prowler"", that were overlooked at the box office, but are such a pleasure to find on the video store shelves. What I like most about ""Alone in the Dark"" is that it's not just your usual teens-in-peril-here-comes-the-masked-killer movie. There is an actual storyline here, with a pretty cool plot, and one really great twist. ""Alone in the Dark"" does a great job of building up suspense, which is a lost art that you don't get with today's films. Instead of things jumping out at you to get scares, ""Alone in the Dark"" creates a creepy atmosphere that continually builds throughout the film, with almost no cheap scares along the way. If you are a fan of 80's horror this is one you should be sure to pick up."
4,Very good for a night with the would be girlfriend.,"Great horror film. Good suspense! This movie has all the elements of a great horror film: escaped crazy people, darkness, and axes. This is a really good get together with the friends and get scared movie. A lot of suprises so you might want to invite someone for a lap to jump into!"
3,Okay,"This quality of the digital transfer was a bit sub-par. My copy was simply a poor transfer and it as distracting, at times, to see pixels flashing around the screen while trying to read the subtitles. The storyline was reasonably entertaining. I found the story a tad flat."
2,Interesting Subject - Incredibly poorly written,"As a former USMC officer, I found this an interesting look at a little known piece of history about WWII. However, I found the writing was at a high school level. The author repeats and repeats the same thing in the same words. At least 10 times he says that the first man or squad sent out is bait. At least 10 times he repeats the challenge and same passwords for going through the lines. This book needed a very good editor."
5,Reviewer,Great book on a little know battle that helped shape the success of the US pacific campaign. The author does a fantastic job of combining the operational and tactical facts with the actual description and emotions of the marines involved in combat. The combination makes it a great read.
1,poor quality,"As soon as I put laundry on it, one arm bent, promptly followed by the other 3 arms. It had no strength and I am very disappointed. I'm from Europe where these types of dryers are very popular. Next time I will look for individually strung lines, adjustable height and more than 165 ft of line length. Don't waste your money!"
2,Good intro to data visualization for novices.,"Westphal and Blaxton do a good job of introducing data mining concepts, but focus too heavily on data visualization techniques. A large chunk of the book is devoted to tool walk throughs, information that will be outdated soon. The case studies cover several industries, but fail to show the authors' methodology in action. The greatest shortcoming is the EXTREMELY brief discussion on neural networks, genetic algorithms and other non-visual analytic methods. If you are a beginner in data visualization, buy this book. Anyone looking for in depth (or even an intro) discussion on AI and statistics, look elsewhere."
3,The weakest of the four,"It's the 3rd of the 4 in this series (so far) and the weakest of them. Falls back way too much on unoriginal flashbacks to the first two volumes. But probably still must be gotten, to keep the set complete and to not miss anything about those wooden but lovable characters. Fascists, militarists, plutocrats, simple, honest folk and deadly Nasties.Quote of the decade, ""Jawohl, mein Obergruppenfuhrer!"""
2,Secret Honor,Not one of Griffin's best efforts. Little action and excessive attention to the boring details of aristocratic life on both sides of the conflict.
1,Secret Honor review,"This is by far the weakest of Griffin's novels, and I have read them all. It is ""the Rich and Famous in Argentina"", filled with unnecessary, lengthy descriptions, situations which have no relevance to the plot, a rehash of too much of previous volumes, and just a matter of ""treading water"" for 600+ pages. I got to the end and thought ""Who cares? Why did he write this? The plot did not develop at all."" I am very frustrated by this volume. I will give him one more chance, but after being burned this time, if he burns me again, it will be the last time. Can anyone tell me what part of the plot was developed beyond the end of the previous volume in this series?"
3,Lack of Detail,"I, also, have read every Griffin book and until this ""Honor Bound"" series was very satisfied. My reason for dissatisfaction is Griffin's and his editors' abysmal German. Virtually every German word or phrase has a mistake in spelling or grammar. He even misspells the first name Ingeborg as Ingebord. For readers who know no German, this is, naturally, no distraction, but, for those of us who do, it is entirely unacceptable"
1,Don't buy this book !!!,"If you've read the first two books of this series, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK ! It is a complete waste of time and money . WEB blew it on this one ! Absolutely no action , but , a lot of wedding planning and who is sitting across from who at the dinner table . This book should be pulled from the market !"
4,ive read it twice,"w. e. b. griffen is a great story teller, his knowledge of his tail is great and true i have read this book twice"
4,"AS always, can't put it down","Great book. Slow moving at first, but it doesn't take long before you find it difficult to put it down.Mr Griffin, I'm waiting the next The Corps Series. Being a retired Marine, I find the books interesting and informative."
2,An Interlude to the Next One,"I have long been a WEB Griffin fan. His one fault in my opinion is that he writes each book to stand alone. Consequently, the deeper into a series of books you get, the more time he has to spend to rehash what you may not have read. One of the other reviews panned Secret Honor for only having 1 shot fired in anger. Since each story must have a beginning, a middle, and an end, it makes sense that books in a series do also. This is a ""middle book"" and sets the ground work for the future books. I still found it entertaining although I wish the author would quit using the full name and title of each character as he brings them into the chapter. He must get paid by the word!"
2,"Too ""Ho-Hum"" for me!","Although I am an avid reader of W.E.B. Griffin military books,this whole series is turning out to be a real disappointment to me. I hope that the current book is the last of this series. The story line involving an American Marine of Argentine descent and his involvement with the O.S.S. and struggles to keep Argentina out of W.W.II as a German co-belligerent is awfully thin and contrived. The character development usually present in most Griffin books is sadly lacking here.The characters are,at best,forgettable and terribly shallow. This is probably the worst effort yet by my favorite author;it is the only one of his books that I didn't feel the urge to re-read. Two stars is generous. If you started this series and feel the need to wrap it up--O.K. read the book. Not a good intro to W.E.B. Griffin for a new reader..."
2,A SCAM on his followers,"I always have looked for Griffin's next book, so I picked this one up immediately, only to find that it repeated 75% of the previous one in the Honor series and left the reader nowhere. There are even direct copies of paragraphs from the previous novel (which I enjoyed). In order for him to keep up the production tempo of his releases, I am sure he has a staff of sub-writers, but he needs to find some who don't plagiarize his old writings. Summary--boring, too long and no story conclusion."
2,Not the best of his works,"i was quite disappointed by this book-slow moving, little intrigue, more focused on the sex lives of the subjects than the development of the plot - not as impressive as his usual work - had to force myself to finish it"
1,secret honor,"Of all Mr. Griffins books that I have read this is the most boring, it would take a computer to keep up with all the German surnames. I read about three quarters of the book and threw it away, I found no suspense, no action, no plot, nothing to keep your interest. I read as much as I did hoping for something. I will admit I haven't read the previous two books of this series, I can only hope that in them there is something to make this book ""work""."
2,Not up to snuff.,"I eagerly await Griffith's war series books. But this one takes the first 100 pages and more to bring new readers who haven't read the first two books in the series, up to date. Unfortunately, this is done with a series of very boring meetings between groups of the participants, Nazis, Argentinians, Americans. Booooring! After that has put the reader to sleep, the book doesn't go on to great action, but just slow moving on the part of the participants. I was very disappointed in the book, especially since I bought it in hardcover, not being able to wait for a paperback version. Hope the rest aren't like this."
2,Spinning in Place,"I have read all of Griffin's military books and I have to say that this one was a disappointment. In short, it accomplishes nothing and doesn't really move any of the major plot lines along. Frade's marriage has had a big setup for several books but is almost a footnote and the OSS is simply the same-old/same-old. Graham's verbal assault on Frade in his own house is so silly as to beg, ""just try it buddy, it's the results that count."" It also has to be read with a reference to Nazi rank structure handy in order to keep track of everyone. I just didn't feel I would have missed anything if I skipped this book and read the next one when it comes out. Hopefully, we'll see some closure on some of the story lines. If I want open, unending stories that go nowhere, I can always read The Wheel of Time."
2,"Secret Honor, few Secrets","Posted reader-reviews by Kelley and Anthony, fellow West-Coasters are essentially accurate judgments. I rate it 2 stars rather than 3 because it's so much less intriguing than any previous Griffin (Butterworth) novels, in this series, The Corps, or possibly anything but the Philly PD books. As for historical inaccuracies, I right away picked up on the ""Army Air Corps,"" but that's almost obscure; many people don't realize Hap Arnold changed the name to US Army Air Forces in mid-1941. Many other ""errors"" seem to be continuity or proofreading errors, getting times wrong, as with the invitation to see Peron at 7:30PM but arriving before 6. Not as good as the first two in the Honor series, we still need to read this, I just wish it had been incorporated with #4, so we didn't have to pay to read about a couple of months in the life of Clete Frade."
2,Listening to tape takes a lot of concentration,"Some books on tape are easy listening for long car trips. Some involve more complex plots and/or ideas and take more concentration than is safe when driving. I suppose tapes have to be judged by slightly different standards than the books on which they based. A book like <Secret Honor> has so many characters, so many plot threads and twists, that the listener wishes he could look back to remind himself about who a person is or what event is being referred to. Even in its abridged format (6 hours), this novel is pretty involved. Frankly I began to give up half way through. I did like the reader however, and the sporadic use of background music and some sound effects helped somewhat. The plot began very nicely, holding my interest, but then too many things began to happen--and none of them were particularly exciting--to characters with whom I felt little or no sympathy. For those who like this author or sprawling spy novels, this tape is recommended."
2,Go to the library or wait for the paperback,"This was an effort to finish. Absolutely no excitement, little intrigue, and not much else, unless you count two shotgun weddings. Shows what really went on in Argentina during WWII - nothing exciting! I never cared for this new series anyway, and hope next time Griffin gets back to The Corps or the Badge of Honor series. Assuming he hasn't just plain lost it."
2,Why write this series at all?,"I am sorely puzzled. The master who wrote the Men at War, Brotherhood of War and Corps series seems to be floundering. His latest book is poorly researched (Himmler NEVER was ""Reichsprotektor"", EL bitcho, etc.) and very badly edited, with words missing in the middle of sentences; both the Spanish and German language quotes are atrociously misspelled; time and again the reader is jarred. It appears that a few years ago, the writer had a good editor and at least a German-speaking advisor at his disposal; alas, no longer. This book is far from the military masterpieces of the Corps, Men at War, Brotherhood of War and even the Badge of Honor series. Too bad. Two recommendations: 1. Drop this series, it isn't worth to be bought. 2, Go back to the Corps, where you shine, Mr. William E. B....."
1,Secret Honor,"Griffins book Secret Honor is a big dissappointment, I would suggest he has become a troll of commercialism. No plot, no suspence, no excitement, no story line. This book reads like a soap opera, a high school student could have written a better story. It seems Griffin is relying on his name to sell this book, also his other novels in this series are somewhat dull and redundent in character. I hope he wakes up, I will not purchase or recommend any more of his books."
1,I hope he gets better soon,"I have been reading W.E.B. Griffin's books from the beginning. The latest, ""Secret Honor"" is by far, the worst he has ever written. The last two books have been very difficult to read. I normally get his books one day and will have them read withing two or three days. No so with this book. It took my three months of forcing myself to sit down and read it. The story want dumb, it just didn't seem to go anywhere. I like Clete and think more should be done to develop his charter. The ending was a non event. I found nothing thrilling about Secret Honor at all. I rate it 1 star and that is being too kind but there isn't a 1/4 star I can use for it. Come on Mr. Griffin, let's have some more excitement , the police series is good as is the Marine series. Has all you money softened you up? Do you just want to retire and live on an island?"
5,Want to try Scrooge...? Buy THIS one first!,"This is the first Scrooge story I had ever read (and first Carl Barks story as well) and I couldn't have had a better introduction to the talent of the Duck Man. Although I had read this story first in ""Walt Disney's Uncle Scrooge: His Life and His Times"", this edition is just as good of a read (I prefered the coloring job for this particular story in ""Life and Times"", although generally I prefer the color in the Gladstone reprint volumes.) Excellent artwork, a well-orchestrated storyline, and an appropriate and clever ending makes this a thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended reading experience. Also includes a Gyro Gearloose story."
3,Too many mistakes,"I am a Paul Tracy fan since his early Indy Lights days and was excited to see a book written about him. I wanted to know a little bit more about him and I think I have from the book, but there are too many mistakes in the book. In one chapter, Paul debuts for Team Penske at Michigan International Speedway in 1991, which is right, but in the next chapter his debut at MIS happened in 1992, which is wrong. His famous hero dance occured after winning in Long Beach, not Houston. There are at least sixmistakes concerning the Indianapolis 500. The pictures are good."
2,Never Too Fast and Rarely Personal,"As a huge Paul Tracy and CART fan, I looked forward to reading this book about one of the most controversial drivers on the circuit, hoping to get an up close and personal view of the driver and what makes him tick.I was disappointed. Mr. Ferriss seems to spend most of the time waving the Canadian Flag, sugar coating interviews, and reporting race results that could have been gotten from the newspaper and enthusiast publications. Compared to the driver's actual life, this book doesn't even come close to having anything controversial. In actuality, for the length of the book, there really aren't that many quotes from direct interviews with Paul. It appears to me, that Paul had very little input on this book project. We do learn that Paul wants his privacy.If so, why bother writing about him?"
2,Review of Talking Heads C.D.,"I will not be collecting any more Talking Heads compact disks. I know we enjoyed this music at some time or place, he must have forgotten."
1,Don't bother,Very disappointed in the selection of songs. From 2 CD's I would save 4 tracks.Spend your music $$$ on something else.
5,"Thank the ""Heads"" that put together this collection","I'll start off by saying that I am not the world's biggest Talking Heads fans. But I do like a lot of their individual songs, and they are to be commended for putting together one of the best ever anthology albums. This is appreciated for those of us who want all the best material without having to shell out major coin for a box set full of excess material we don't want. At two discs and 33 songs, covering every one of their studio albums, ""Sand in the Vaseline"" uncanilly manages to hit the all the highlights. Everything essential is here, from early successes like ""Love--Building on Fire"" and ""Psycho Killer"" to late career successes such as ""Wild Wild Life"" and ""(Nothing But) Flowers.""Overall, this is a perfect album for the casual fan. My hat is off to the Heads."
3,"A good compilation of Talking Heads Hits, that could have been better...","With such an 'eclectic' band like Talking Heads, a search for individual albums (and/or Hits) should produce better results than creating this compilation that, certainly, is like having ""sand in the Vaseline"" (for any meaning you would like to give to this statement!).In my case, I would bet for having the full song list of ""Little Creatures"", ""True Stories"" and even ""Speaking In Tongues"" included in a compilation of T.H. Hits.Anyway, if you're exploring in music you heard before some time, but never knew who was(were) the performer(s), this ""Sand in the Vaseline"" will certainly work for you!"
3,Half A Cake,"I really like the first disk of this CD--the early songs (mostly '70's) sound so fresh, energetic, and offbeat! ""Sugar on My Tongue,"" ""Don't Worry About the Government,"" and of course ""Psycho Killer"" are spry and hard-hitting, terse exclamations from some lonely urban loft. Even some of the mid-period efforts shine, like ""Burning Down the House,"" ""Big Country,"" etc.Most of the second disk is completely unlistenable. It is absolutely the worst music I've ever owned. The band's tense sense of melody and adventure has been replaced by a bogus multi-cultural big-band minstrel act, full of posey SoHo winks & nudges and a smug detatchment. The almost chartable drop in quality is as depressing as the slick, squeaky dance grooves masquerading as eclecticism. Didn't the band realize that it was this kind of gaudy shallowness that they had originally reacted against? A sad aural plummet."
4,"Good Intro to TH, but you need RiL and SMS","Essential Songs that are Missing: Born Under Punches, The Girls want to be with the girlsBest Song: Life During Wartime (live)Worst Song: PopsicleBest Bonus Track: Lifetime Piling Up (essential th track)Buy this album first: Stop Making Sense (and the dvd)Also check out: Look into the Eyeball by David Byrne"
4,Estrangement vs. emotions,"I borrowed this compilation and I realised they weren't just another wise-cracking ""experimental"" new wave band - they had melodies, ideas, even emotions. Their cover of Take Me To The River is absolutely inspiring, and the catchy tunes like Girlfriend Is Better or Once In A Lifetime really get you jumping up and down. At some points, David Byrne's voice gets annoying and the music seems a bit soft-weight, but after one or two such pieces the third is always a masterwork."
5,This stuff grows on you!,"If you're confused at first, don't worry. I (and I am not alone) first heard some interesting cuts on the radio, bought this set, found most of it unbearably annoying and put it away, gave it another chance a few months later, and got addicted. It's wonderful stuff, and this is a good collection of this great band.That said, there are a couple of songs which didn't make it on to the disc which should have, but I guess that's a fan talking. All the major hits are here, and there are only about two I'd remove from the set. Very, very good!"
4,A Quieter Talking Heads,"What I love about the Talking Heads is their eccentricity. With David Byrne as the fearless leader, the Talking Heads produced countless epic tracks and albums. But nothing quite measures up to a live performance, and I think that comes into play on Sand in the Vaseline. The album has a quieter sound, sometimes even to the point of sounding subdued. While it does contain some of the greatest hits, these are not the greatest versions of those hits. And while I still love the Talking Heads, I would recommend almost any other album by them over this one."
4,"Wow, what a classic!","It took way too long for this DVD to come out.It may be a show from a long time ago, but it was groundbreakingin it's day.I still enjoy the laughs!"
5,Please sell dvds of all seasons! Thank you!,I'm glad I bought this set so I could see the earlier shows that I didn't see and hopefully I can see the rest of the series on dvd because I haven't seen these shows since they were on network tv.Very enjoyable! I hope the next season includes the rest of the Reunion special. I'd love more bonus features!..classic Norman Lear production! Intelligent and emotional dialogue with relevant storylines. The stories and characters were endearing and sympathetic. Also love the clothes and interior sets!
5,Satisfied,Ordered the One day at a time series for my husband for christmas. He LOVES it only wishes the other seasons were in print
5,One Day At A Time,I am very please with this DVD and the fast service that I received it. I would order again from this company!Thank you!Lorraine
4,brings back good memories,I alwayed enjoed this show. I am so glad it was brought back on DVD to keep permanently.
2,"One Day at a Time, Not as Good as I Remember","Sorry, Norman Lear, but this one is a bust. I watched this show diligently every week when I was a teen. I loved ""Maude"". Loved ""All in the Family"". For some apparent reason, I must have loved this show, also. But as I watched it, the first season, wow, was I on drugs or what? This show sucks. Sorry. Have to be blunt about this one. It is overacted, totally unbelievable and just plain not funny. I give it 2 stars because it took a lot of guts for this group of actors to lower themselves to do this show."
1,no reunion on the dvd set as promised,I am taking mine back there is no reunion even mentioned on the dvd set it self! So there is no one day at a time reunion on it what so ever ! very disapointing!james
5,it's worth it.,i love watching this dvd while i'm getting ready to go to work.this truly brings back memories. it was every sunday night this show would come on. i even remember where i was for several episodes.i hope season 2 will be out very soon.
5,Very good,"I always laugh at reviews of bands "" swan song "" or best albums, cds, whatever. The pretension is as knee deep as pig crap. The time was right for Ministry to make their best cd. And they did. This is very good stuff. Good enough for mainstream consumers to listen to without getting too rattled. Yes its ""heavy"" ""punchy"" ""raw"" and slick and dark and groundbreaking and all those words. It made lots of money. It wont make as much now cuz you can get it for free if you look. But i recomend you buy it because i had to when it came out. Ok, was that review obscure and angry enough to make me alternative hip sheek cool punk ?"
3,not best ministry rekkid,"Land of Rape and Honey was the by far the best. and the freshest.i would say the pailheads first e.p. with Ian Mckay of minor threat on vocals would be the second best minstry.then terrebly tastey minds taking that pailhead and rape and honey sound one leap forward would be the next best.then the revolting cocks live album, which is just nuts and is a must for all drum and bass producers and dance producers looking to add vocals to the mix. fast beats and slow grooves.then this psalm record that is a failed rehash of taerrably tastey mind. i give it 3 stars rather than 1 because of jesus built my hot rod, which deserves a 5 on its own. i wish the butthole surfers could have taken the cue.be warned that early ministry was the wimpiest new wave syth pop band on the planet. thats part of why ministry were so fun. because it was obvious it was all the machismo was joke or lie."
3,Like an adreneline rush that soon dissipates,"The problem with Ministry's music is a problem with industrial hardcore in general - it fairly quickly wears out it's welcome. The fist pumping head banging mood that it gives you is great for awhile but the relentless hardcore techno dirge lacks variation or any subtlety and soon grows thin. NWO is a great hard and nasty opener to this record but a song like Jesus Built My Hot Rod seems little more than a metallic novelty after the first few listens. I'm not surprised that Ministry's fan base has dwindled. They no longer sound as fierce as they once did and can't offer much other than heard-it-before techno aggression. I'm not saying this is a bad album; it has its moments but I think preciously few would select it for their 10 recordings to take to a desert island. Their earlier recording, The Land of Rape and Honey, is a better album but is still fairly relentless serving of ugly hardcore techno."
3,Devil doo-wop,"3 1/2For an early 90's industrial-metal release, Psalm 69 still comes slathered in a surprisingly seductive sheen which belies its dated and doomed synthesis; still keeping it apart from countless imitators and even emulators."
3,good,i usually listen to this kind of sh**! but this album is their best! i have to see the lyrics are good!
4,MINISTRY'S BEST ONE!!!,"this is MINISTRY best album...they really connected the industrial METAL to the thrash from SLAYER and create this metal industrial bomb!!!JESUS BUILT MY HOTROD, JUST ONE FIX, NEW WORLD ORDER and HERO are great!!!!"
4,Beautiful and Brutal,"Never has so beautiful a work been so terrifying to behold - or is it the other way around? With this late-industrial masterpiece, Ministry makes a bold statement: brutality and beauty can coexist at the same time. The nature of this merge is fragile and tenous - the balance is lost with ""T.V. Song"" and is almost lost during ""Jesus Built My Hotrod"" and ""Hero,"" but with only one low spot and two songs that are, at worst, a tad pro forma, this release deserves every bit of praise that comes its way - and more. By focusing as much on the lush sonic backgroud as to the brutal pounding fore, Ministry turned out a CD that was as sensitive as it was sardonic."
2,Not Much To Say,"If I stop one person from buying this album it'll be worth it. For me the true highlight is ""Just One Fix"". I've had this album for six years and it never makes it out of the CD bin. I think that kinda says it all. I don't know what I was expecting when I bought this CD but I certainly never found it. Please if you are still set on purchasing this CD may I suggest a used outlet first. I'd hate to see someone spend the full price on this."
4,2 Things Should Have Been Fixed,I noticed a moajority of these tracks were quite repetetive. The first track being 3 minutes of the pure same beat. It's a good beat. but they pick about 4 seconds of line and repeat it.Second... this album is really really short. each song being like 2-3 minutes long.But one thing. the guy on Psalm 69 sounds like me in 8th grade. That was weird
5,Ministry: The Power of their Psalms,"Quite possibly one of the most intense CD's ever created. From the moment your laser starts reading, the sounds of ministry make your head move up and down, faster and faster 'till you're there. Few have ever mastered the use of samples in their music like Rob Zombie, and Ministry comes close. Of course it's great to hear that speech from George Bush in NWO, and all about the divine intervention upon one's car. Overall, if you listened to gospel before, you'll hat this CD, but if you popped in your Tool, Deftones, or Zombie CD, you're sure to enjoy this cd."
3,Not as good,"I'm sorry but I have to dissagree with all hype surrounding this album. It's definately a let down from their previous two. Don't get me wrong, half of the songs on here are very good, but there are some songs on here that just sound like repetttttative noise. TVII makes me reach for the fast forward button faster than a starving Nigerian reaches for a sandwich. Not to mention the ridiculous ""Jesus built my hotrod"", which definately does not show the sinister edge that most of their songs,(especially the earlier ones)did so well. This album proves that the worst thing that can happen to a band is become mainstream. I do like the first track, N.W.O. and ""Just One Fix"",which is repetative, but in a good way. ""Scarecrow"", probably being my favorite. But, as far as the rest of the songs, I could probably do without. The classic ""Land of Rape and Honey"" is still their best, even after all these years."
5,Best Mnistry album,"When this record came out it established a new sound, the heaviest thing ever heard at the time! It was a very intense experience, nowadays psalm 69 remains Ministry's best effort so far. Among the best Industrial metal records of all time."
1,About as useful as a rock...,...and holds a charge as well as one does too. Must be time to get a new cordless screwdriver as the last 2 Skil replacement power packs that i got lasted about a week. Well actually this one lasts about about 0-30 seconds after a full 2-3 day charge. It spins pretty good for about the first 10 seconds then slows to a crawl pretty quickly just before it pukes. I guess Sanyo doesn't make cells like they used to. Junk. Avoid.
5,Works Great,"I had this old power scredriver for years with no working battery. I finally decided to find one. Online I found this one, so bought two. It works great."
4,satisfied with product,Batteries order were received in a timely manner .... they fit - they charged - they worked ....thank you !!!!
5,FlexCharge Battery,"A truely international battery, widely used in Europe and the Middle-East. Good for quite a few appliances besides the Skil portable drill I own. The Europeans use the battery for power screwdrivers, toys, radios, boom-boxes and etc. Only trouble is that the Ni-Cad battery has a charge memory if you don't properly discharge/use until it's flat. The old battery I had lasted for about eight [8] years."
5,Skil 92940 3.5 V Flexcharge Battery review,The batteries work fine in the drill and screwdriver that I've had for the last 10 years! Shipping was prompt and as stated!
3,"Good Product, but don't bother!","Owning a Skil screwdriver for many years, I bought two new batteries after the old battery died, charged them up and was very happy. Unfortunately on the second charge I discovered that the charger had burned out. So, if I buy a new charger it will cost me more than buying a brand new screwdriver set with a new battery ( different style of course! ) and charger. What would you do? I have two new batteries available if you still have a charger that has not burned out."
4,battery order,Quick and easy order and you all had the best price going on an item not readily in stock.
1,But it costs a lot ...,"I bought a drill with 2 of those batteries. Now after 3 yearsof use, the batteries have developed memory effect and have lostall the juice. I have to buy 2 batteries that means I will bespending around $35 total. Again after 3 years I will be in samesituation. So I have decided to buy electric drill and get overwith this charging. Also they are more powerful compared to thosedrills. BTW there is always an extension cord!!!"
1,flex charge battery,THE BATTERIES I BOUGHT SEEM TO BE OLD OR NOT OF GOOD QUALITY AS THE ORIGANALS THEY DON'T HOLD A CHARGE VERY LONG AND THEY DIE FAST!!!! I WILL NOT BUY ANY MORE OF THESE FROM AMAZON. COM. AND DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TRUST ANY OF THE OTHER PRODUCTS.
3,Don't use in the cold,"When I got mine it showed a too-low psi. The weather was a bit cold. I put the device in the windowsill to warm up and then tried it and it worked normal. I took it apart and saw that the part that moves the needle is a curved copper ""lung"" that of course would be more resistant to movement in the cold because cold makes metal more stiff."
1,Disappointed,The compression gauge looks decent but I hae spark plugs with long 18mm threads. The gauge doesn't fit and requires an adapter. I don't think the adapter is sold separately. I have to buy a mor expensive kit that includes the adaptor. That makes this one useless. I expect to have to resell it.
5,One Strike,This video is very educational and informative. If you are studing self defense this is a must video. Excellent purchase.
1,HORRIBLE!!,After using this ink cartridge for only 2 days my computer will not even recognize that the ink is there. DO NOT BUY!!!
4,He going to blow up one day,This man can sing!I heard him sing on adina howard album and kept up with his career ever since.His 1st cd was a r&b cd and it was a minor hit on a independant label. THis is is gospel cd and it is wonderful. You can feel his strong voice in every song mixed with a hip hip influence. If you like hip hop and gospel such as kirk franklin buy this.
3,Good Album,"Praise at your own risk"" is destined to be a leader in contemporary gospel music. Bold words I hear you say but from the MaryMary/Campbell opener of ""I just wanna (dance now)"" your appetite is certainly whetted. The soulful sounding Speaks is on production and with most songs either written or co-written by him this album is exciting. It's inspirational, innovative and positively addictive. Praise is certainly the central theme and Mr Speaks is not holding back. From the ballad inspired ""Lord of life"" to the heart-felt ""All I need"", get ready to have the album on constant repeat."
4,Great Workout - short and to the point!,"All you need is a mat, and two dumbbells (min. 8 lbs each) to work this program. Michael is easy to follow and he demonstrates the proper form and technique through each movement. Once you make it through the advertisments at the beginning of the video (why do they have these?) the workout lasts about 30 minutes including warm up and cool down. It's a great workout for all fitness levels - you won't feel left out if you are a beginner, and the exercises are easily modified to accomodate the more advanced. Michael tells you everything you might need to know. I've seen many workout tapes for men, and this is one of the best."
2,Only for those already in shape,"If you have a gut, even a small one, you will find some of the Abs excercises impossible. Plain and simple, my gut gets in the way of me being able to do the excercises in proper form. I'm not out of shape by any stretch, my wife's just a good cook. My Dr. says I'm 10 pounds overweight, but all of it's in the gut. I think the video will be great to maintain my gut, once I flatten it, but it's not for a beginner. As far as the chest part goes, the video just does several sets of pushups and 1 dumbell workout. Nothing exciting there."
5,Never ending challenge!,"I've been doing Michael Perrons routine for about 5 years. his exercises along with Pilates are the only method that has ever worked for me with Great results. i never feel as though the routines have become stale and boring in fact i can't seem to reach a peak in these exercises where i still don't feel sort of challenged and like i stated in the beginning it's been 5 YEARS!I'd like to reach Micheal Perron and tell him this but i can't find him on line anywhere. It would be great if Mr Perron makes a part 2 of this video but perform the exercises on the ""Bean"" or Swiss exercise ball to make it even more challenging!"
5,oh yeah this one's the best,"everyone loves this one, if you don't have it your CD collection is shameful."
2,"2 really great songs, not much else on this album though","Midlife Crisis and a Small Victory are two great songs, but the rest of the album just isn't very listenable. Try The Real Thing or a ""Best of"" compilation instead."
3,why a 1993 version?,"great album. the advertisement described the new mobile fidelity gold disc remastering, but i received a 1993 re-issue (the ad did say import, so that part was accurate). anyway, i called to complain, and i received another identical copy. i sent one back, and kept the other. the re-issue has 'easy', which isn't on the other versions, so i decided to keep it."
5,super rad,"this album astounds me. fnm's best (though king 4 a day is a real close 2nd, and their only other really good album, imho)... in my top 3 of the 90's, without a doubt. i can hear so many of the big bands of today ripping the vibe of this album off, it's freaking pathetic. the formula for success in hard rock nowadays is thus:1. rip off angel dust era fnm.2. lose the keyboards.3. get a dj (cuz that's an instrument!?).4. lose the sense of humor (unless it's jokes about beating up women and others who are weaker than you)...5. oh, and lose the intelligent lyrics, cuz they're lame, too.too many bands bite fnm, simple as that. i'm looking at you, deftones, incubus, korn, limp bizkit, etc... those are the only ones i know the names of, but there are many more... this album (and this band) was WAAAAAAAY ahead of its time... like so many other artists (hendrix, zappa, beatles, zeppelin, pink floyd...), we're still catching up."
5,faith no more at their best,in sightful and original. i think the best album. nooone is like them. evolving as they did- and always breaking new ground.
4,Shades of Bungle,"Another solid FNM album.There's some foreshadowing of Mr. Bungle in songs like ""Be Aggressive"", and then there's the always awesome ""Midlife Crisis""."
5,hang a picture from my forehead,you will buy this album right this second because everyone needs religion in their lives.
5,What else could be said: GENIUS,"What can one say after reading the praising, but true reviews prior to mine. But I had to give my opinion. Angel Duast is perhaps the best modern piece of music, of all! I am very much into classical music, but FNM have managed to satisfy my need for melody. Just listen to Patton's voice in Smaller And Smaller (where do they find those harmonies and melodies); it is so epic and full of meaning and feeling... The guitar rifs on Caffeine... Every song is perfect...The album ranges in musical styles, but somehow it all works. Just compare RV to Jizzlobber. I think that every FNM album since 1989 is exceptional, but this is simply a musical classic... BUY THIS RECORD, IT DESERVES EVERY SUCCESS IT CAN GET..."
5,The perfect CD,"This album is so far ahead of its time 6 years later we still haven't found out how good it really is. In FNM's second album featuring uber-vocalist Mike Patton all the elements come together to make the ultimate un-classifiable album. Bordin, Bottum, Gould, and even guitar rock dinosaur Jim Martin (Who's contributions to the album are a matter of debate, but who at least kept FNM true to its Heavy Metal roots) become the band they were destin to be. Evey track a masterpeice, the whole album a classic that never will get the credit it deserves. Each member brings their rythems, harmonies, melodies and riffs to make songs that are pemanently exciting and new; way ahead of their contemporaries. People who know realize how influential FNM's greatest album is and why it is the best rock album of all time."
5,What can you say.,I listened to this album in the Navy and while it was playing I ended up not knowing where I was and didn't want to find out. The music has an almost narcotic effect on you and you can't get popped on a drug test for it. Its insanely addictive and the more you hear it the more you want to listen. Just like a drug now isn't it :)L8r
5,lyrics and harmony,"starkly insightful, bone crushing lyrics with heavily layered and textured melodies. ""I started this, its all for me, what's yours is mine and mine is mine that's plain to see"" provides insight into how some people gbdc actually do think. other songs give the same insight on everything from middle age ennui to remorse to the oppressive nature of addiction."
5,Greatest album ever,"Pop album? maybe you meant Experimental metal. So man, what can you say about one of the greatest album ever made in rock. Well, it's just beautiful and wowed me after i finished listening to it. It's heavy, creepy, it has soul, whatever mood you're in, you'll get it. My favorites are the beautiful death metal inspired songs (death metal beautiful?, wow) Jizzlobber and Malpractice. Those songs been called art death metal or something, and that's exactly what they are. The easy cover is 100x better than the original and it's funny that Mike has a much more amazing voice than mostly any singer out there. Yet he has the most insane screams in metal. So, you know what I'm telling you, get this and unless you've heard Patton's other crazy bands, then this album will be easy for you to listen to. Way different than The Real Thing so don't expect the funkiness they once had. You need to appreciate this masterpiece and get it."
3,dark provocative disturbed and heavy,"I remeber listening to this album when I was approx 17 and absolutely loving it. I have been listening to it again recently. There are a few good tracks but its nowhere near as good as ""The Real Thing"" or ""King For A Day"" which cracks me up in a lot of parts due to its ridiculous and meaningless extremeness.""Land of sunshine"" and ""Midlife Crisis"" are ok. ""Caffeine"" and ""Smaller and Smaller"" are good although the latter drags on a bit. ""RV"" is ok for a while, but you know the drill pretty quickly after a while. The highlights would be ""Everything's ruined"" ""A Small victory"" and ""easy"". ""Be Aggressive"" and ""Malpractice"" are plain stupid and annoying. ""Kindergarten"" bores me. Still though, Angel Dust is a good album, just not my favorite anymore. It is a deranged effort with some mysterious yet troubling moments. Contrary to most people, I have more trouble with Patton's voice in Angel's Dust than in The Real Thing."
1,"Truly Awful, Pretentious, Self Indulgent, Drug Addled Crap","This will disappoint anyone expecting a band that sounds like Faith No More on Epic. Basically, the guitar player wants to be in Metallica, the singer wants to be in the Commodores, and often tracks sound like two different songs are being played simultaneously. This is one of those ""look at us were better than heavy metal"" albums that arty people like Deep Purple did with a philharmonic in the 70's. Such bands could get away with it after a string of hit albums, here Faith tries to do it after one hit album and the fans abandoned them. Mid-Life crisis is a great song, at least sounds like Epic, but everything else is awful. ""Aggressive"" has cheerleaders singing in a bad attempt to manufacturer a jock anthem, ""RV"" is a boring ballad, ""Kindergarden"" and the rest have one chord grungs riff out of place with the songs. Spend your money on the numerous Greaest Hits this band has to get ""Midlife"" and avoild this gawd awful mess."
2,Not that great,"i finally bought this after hearing so many good things about this album. but now that i have it, i dont think its really as good as everyone says. the songs arent funny, the music is boring. the only good song is midlife crisis, and that is still medeocre at best. i dont understand why people like this album. to tell you the truth, i think mike patton sounds terrible on this album. he sounds much better in mr. bungle, and that band is just so much better anyway. the only good thing patton has done is mr. bungle. anything else by mike is not really worth listening too. i dont consider him a musical genius like many others do. there is so much more out there that is so much better than this. i find this album a waste of money. it got two stars for midlife crisis.I have now said my two cents, thank you."
2,Hasn't aged well,"FNM were never innovative; everything they did the Chili Peppers already did years earlier. Want proof? Then listen to ""Uplift Mofo Party Plan"" and ""Freaky Styley"" and Angel Dust won't sound too original anymore. All FNM did, was turning up the amps. Just like all the Nu-Metal bands who claim to be influenced by these pseudo-art rockers. The only saving grace for this album could be strong songwriting but there are hardly any worthwile tunes among them being ""Everything's Ruined"", ""A Small Victory"" and the faux-prog of ""Jizzlobber"". There's even a trashy country-rock song to further bolster the band's make-believe eclecticism and creativity to camouflage there lack of musicianship and originality (take for one Jim Martin's thickheaded ""No more than 4 chords!"" punk-attitude or Mike Patton's tiresomely transgressive Anthony Kiedis/Yamatsuke Eye-imitations) because the rest is 08/15 hard rock, highly derivative of Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin."
1,Review #71,"I've browsed the other 70 reviews and have been overwhelemd by the stars. I have to tell you, however, that Angel Dust is the worst album ever created. My first college roommate played it every day (along with Empire from Queensryche) and it never grew on me. This is an educated review. Why? - I've heard this stinking album over and over and I hate it. I'm glad FNM is dead and buried."
1,Angel Dust - MFSL remastered,"I just bought this MFSL-remastered edition of Angel Dust, Gold CD, ultradisc II. Compared to the ""normal"" release it seems that dynamics are worse, it sounds very compressed. I really don't understand what are they trying to do with that ... I don't like the remaster. I'll stick with the old-fashioned edition, but now i have an expensive memorabilia to look at it :(( Meridian G 91 / Jeff Rowland Concerto / Eben X-Centric )"
4,highly lauded 3rd album by fnm,"first off, i remember hearing the track Kindergarten somewhere and going out to buy this on cassette back in '92. Bought it at the same time i picked up Dirt by Alice In Chains. Best songs are: Caffeine, Midlife Crisis, Small Victory, Kindergarten, Crack Hitler, Be Aggresive, and Land Of Sunshine. Much 'heavier' record than its predescessor, 1989's The Real Thing."
5,My first Faith No More cd,"this is truly a great cd. I originally didn't know who Faith no More was, but I found the song ""A Small Victory"" and I got in to them quickly. ""A small victory"" also is my favorite song on the cd. My other favorites are ""Land of Sunshine"", ""Mid-Life Crisis"", ""Kindergarten"" and ""Jizlobber""."
5,The best Album by the most talented band ever!!!,"If you like good music in general, you need to have this CD in your collection. Faith No More is one of the most talented and versatile bands to ever exist, and this album fully reflects the bands talent."
4,"""Shepherd Moons"": a rest stop for a voyager...","""Shepherd Moons"" (the title track) was named after the moonlets that the Voyager probes spotted in Saturn's rings. The album begins with a fitting kind of naturalistic wonder, and then takes turns in unexpected, often melancholy, but equally naturalistic directions. (It has been said, truthfully, that naturalism and paganism are simply two sides of the same coin. This album certainly proves the point.)If one plays Enya's CD's in order of release from front to back, one gets the impression of following in the steps of the artist's own journey through life. The last artist whose work gave me such a strong impression in that sense was John Denver. If John wore his heart on his sleeve, Enya wears hers on a chain around her neck. I don't play this album very often -- there are others by Enya which I believe are better, and certainly less melancholic, than this one -- but it bears the seeds of greater things to come, and for that I appreciate it."
1,"Good for sleeping, but that's about it...,","if you are looking for an album to lull you to sleep, then you'll probably like this. However, it fails to have any real value so far as inspiring or contributing to the New Age musical genre. It's just more swelling synth tones and ""ooh-aah"" kinda vocals. No talent and it gives new age a bad name !"
5,Herd me high,"Shepherd Moons is the perfect follow-up to Watermark. I was so glad to receive this album as a christmas present. I have been listening every since! With this, and watermark in the middle, you will have 2 truly masterful movements echoing through your sound system. Get it, I put my seal on it! *****"
5,This album is incredible.,"If one were to tell me they were unfamiliar with Enya's work, I would tell them to buy this right away. I play this one all the time (I'm wearing it out), it's my favorite and some of her best pieces in my opinion are on here (Caribbean Blue, Ebudae, How Can I Keep From Singing? Smaointe, Afer Ventus) Highly, highly recommended."
5,Shepherd Moons,Her third album; She really pulls together the best composition work from her first two and creates something that transcends the category of new age or spiritual music.
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!,"This CD is, well, WOW!! Enya rules and so does this CD. Her song Lothlorien is insrumental, and anyone who knows anything about Lord of the Rings'll know wehere that is inspired by! Her 6-minute song Smaonte is nice, too. No more words from me!"
5,Enya's best,"This may be the best compilation of Enya's work, with the heart-achingly beautiful ""How Can I Keep from Singing?"", ""Smaointe"" (with a refrain on the Ullian pipes), and the idiocynratic ""Ebudae"", along with nine other great cuts."
5,HAUNTING & ETHERIAL,"THIS IS A BRILLIANT ALBUM, WHICH LURES YOU INTO A DREAMWORLD. LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM WILL PUT YOU TO SLEEP WITH A SMILE ON YOUR FACE!!!."
5,Perfect mood music.,"I mean by relaxing after a long hard day at work. This is the only ""New Age"" album I have ever bought and guess what, I love it. Every person that I have played this album for has ended up buying it, but they never admit it. Wonderful date music. Pick up this CD and bottle of bubbly and draw a hot bubble bath for the wife!"
5,Music For the Soul,"I might never have heard of Enya if it hadn't been for an episode of Northern Exposure. At the end of one of the episodes in which the DJ Chris had literally stolen every light fixture in town to create his work of art, he unveils his masterpiece and while the camera pulls away slowly to expose his grandiose work the most haunting music I've ever heard is being played! The music stayed in my head for days. I asked everyone I knew if they could tell me what the music was. Finally, about a week later there's an article in the paper telling about all the mail and phone calls to the TV studio generated by the inclusion of this song. It was ""Ebudae"" from Enya's Shepherd Moons. I rushed out and got it immediately and have been hooked ever since.I'm not sure if it's the mystique of Celtic history, the Gaelic lyrics, or the haunting vocals, but Enya's music is never far from my CD player. My only complaint? Only two CDs of new material in the 90s has left her fans anxious for more."
4,Shepherd Moons,"Shepherd Moons is the second installment in my Enya collection. After buying A Day Without Rain about a year ago I just melted with frivilous delight at listening to her merely sing like the goddess she is. Her voice is so glorious and entrancing. I find her music spiritualy exhilerating - somehow given this gift to create the most heavenly sounds to carry the soul beyond earthy grounds. New Age has truly never sounded quite so refreshing and elating of the mind. One can honestly buy this simply for Caribbean Blue and Book Of Days.I just love how she takes different parts of her voice and layers them atop each other to concot a dreamy atmosphere as light as air. It also astonishes me how she composes, arranges, performs, and writes almost all her own material.Now that's what I call a true muscisian. I still like her newest release better but this is definitely beautiful . . . no doubt about that."
4,Out of the Mouths of Shepherds.,"""Shepherd Moons"" is GREAT! It is tranquil, solemn, and peaceful. I love the musical tones and colors she uses on this album, creating a masterpiece of songs. If I compare this CD to an artistic era, I would compare this CD to Picasso's combination of his Blue and Red periods. It is enigmatic, calm, pious, and nurturing. I enjoy the songs of ""Shepherd Moons"", ""Caribbean Blue"", ""Ebudae"", ""Book of Days""(which is used in the movie ""Far and Away), ""Evacuee"", ""Marble Halls"", ""Afer Ventus"". I also enjoy the song ""Smaointe"" as well. It stirs a feeling of sadness, but it's a sadness that enables my heart to feel peace within the storm of sadness (this is an abstract interpretation). I enjoy the Uillilean bagpipes the song includes. They give the song a Celtic pride. I could listen to this CD (and the rest of her other CDs) over and over again."
3,Falen into formula,"This, Enya's second solo album, is still good (if not as good as the previous ""Watermark""), but it plunges her into a formulaic mold that she can't seem to get out of. I can imagine that it would be pretty hard to get out of such a mold when it worked so well previously.....but this just sounds so similar to ""Watermark"", I'm not sure if I'm listening to another album or not.With that said, here is my generalized verdict: if you really really liked ""Watermark"", you will like this album. If you only sorta liked ""Watermark"", bear in mind that this one sounds exactly the same. And if you don't like ""Watermark"" at all, then you wouldn't want to buy anything else of Enya anyway. I would have given it four stars for sounding pretty, but I knocked one off because it is so similar to her other stuff."
2,"Good for sleeping, but that's about it...","if you are looking for an album to lull you to sleep (which isn't always a bad thing), then you'll probably dig this. However, it fails to have any real value so far as inspiring or contributing to the New Age musical genre. It's just more swelling synth tones and ""ooh-aah"" kinda vocals. Don't get me wrong, Enya has talent; but I really recommend you go with Clannad or Loreena McKennit instead."
5,The music of Enya is a 5th element!,"Like the sound of the crashing surf or the patter of rain on the wet earth, Enya's music seems to issue straight from Mother nature herself. She has, I believe, created a genre, something I call ""Elemental."" The best way to tap into this element, so to speak, is to play ""Watermark"" or ""Sheperd Moons"" while you drive throuh the Yorkshire Dales in England on a rather damp, cool day. Trust me, it's a beautiful experience. This music blends with the gently rolling green hills and the misty landscape as only the wind and rain could."
4,Not her best,"This was my second Enya album after ""The Memory of Trees."" Thank goodness I didn't start with this, or my intrest would've instantly been killed.The album is rather slow, it doesn't have the same quality of her others. Sure, Enya's up to par, but the songs are less than satisfying. I can't understand the appeal of ""Marble Halls."" It's long and boring, not something I would've expected from Enya. There are good tracks on here, however. ""Book of Days"" is one of my favorites, along with ""Ebudae"" ""Carribbean Blue"" and the title track, ""Shepherd Moons."" There are too many times I hit the skip button to make this a five star pick, and the other thing that happens to most Enya albums: it's too short!I would say this is a great choice for an Enya fan that doesn't have this yet. It's wonderful nighttime music, if you're into that kind of thing. DO NOT make this your first Enya selection. Start with ""Memory of Trees,"" ""Watermark,"" or her newest, ""A Day Without Rain."""
5,Great for Meditation!,All you have to do after a long day is put on the cd and then relax. The music will do the rest.
5,"A must have to summarize safe ""old"" economy principles :-)","If you only could spend half an hour reading, it can be helpful for modeling any services company value chain (p.91), down to strategy maps (p.110), mission deployment (p.73), shared services units alignment (p.193-195) through scorecards (p.164)"
2,Overblown and impractical,"Having used the BSc a few times in my work, I expected this to be a hepful addition to my knowledge base in the area. I found that it added little to the author's other published tomes and to his articles in journals like HBR. Although the basic concept is sound, the implementation challenges are dealt with as you'd expect from an ivory tower-based profesoor and are several steps removed from the challenges that most of my real-world, and smaller company clients, need to address. I truly felt as though I didn't get my money's worth with this purchase and I should have stuck with the materials I already had by the author that was available in other forms. I would have saved time, money and a degree of frustration."
2,Not what I expected,"Liked the features of the unit so tried it out. Loaded 220 Cd's and the red light goes a flashing. Reboot etc to no avail. Returned to Escient. My UPS ticket said it arrived on a Monday. The repaired unit was on my doorstep Wednesday PM !! Escient said they replaced the HD and upgraded my power supply.( apparently the one whose fan runs every half hour even when it was off,,annoying feature)Saved all my previous loaded music tho.Good news so far...Then started to load my remaining 100 or so CD's. Program locks up.Cant get out of the one window,,, would continue to load music but loading progress would indicate 32 minutes to load a 48 minute CD !!That was it for me.Returned for a refund."
2,"nice product, expensive to repair !!","I bought this a little over a year ago, the mother board just died -- out of the blue, no warning. The escient customer service is very very good (they dont out source to india, ireland etc). It cost me almost $300 to have it repaired !!. So, like i said, its an excellent product, but for almost $1000 I think they might be able to cut someone a break."
5,good transaction,transaction went just as it should have Very good from order to recieving it in the mail.have not read content yet
4,Good for experts,"However, it might confuse the beginners. It skips the basics and introduces basic subjects in completely different way. I think the auther asumed his readers are well understand basics. This will create confusion.On the other hand, It is good for experts (only) who can recognize theTraditional ways from the ones proposed in the book. The book will help those experts to expand their thinking.Also it is excellent for trainers who need to simplify things.I would advise any black belt who practiced six-sigma for a while and any six sigma trainer to have this book."
5,A Great Reference Guide for any Manager.,"When I was getting trained in Six Sigma, one of the more challenging aspects was to obtain a firm grasp of the science and methodology behind the statistics taught in the program. This book presents a solid understanding for serious students and managers. What's also great is that it is also a good reference for managers at any level, whether you are involved in Six Sigma of not. P. Theo, National Association of Business Management Professionals,[...]"
5,A Rip-Roaring Good Read,"Kingsley Amis was Ian Fleming's true successor. It's absolutely criminal that this thriller remains out-of-print while John Gardner's drivel remains on book store shelves. Raymond Benson claims to be familiar with this novel. Well if he is, then he should try to model his own work on it and stop writing like he's only seen the Bond movies."
4,Classic Bond in the vein of Ian Fleming,"All the graphic details, action, villains and girls that populated Ian Fleming's original novels come back in this great addition to the Bond saga."
5,Colonel Sun shines brightly in the 007 archives!,"One of the things I like about the reader reviews in Amazon.com is it gives me the opportunity to learn about books that I never knew existed. Colonel Sun is a perfect example. Up until a few months ago, I was completely unaware that someone other than John Gardener and Raymond Benson had authored a novel featuring James Bond.Fans of 007 adventures and escapades should do what I did. Go to the local library and see if this jewel is still on the shelf. You'll be glad you did.5 stars to Mr. Amis \ Markham who does an excellent job writing in the style that made Ian Fleming a household name."
2,Average A&C,"Long awaited DVD version-This was Abbott,s baby ( Costello's was Jackand the Beanstalk). The laughs are few but the great actor Charles Laughton is having a ball. Nice to complete your collection with Rio Rita finally released at the same time."
3,"Not Abbott & Costello's best, but still enjoyable.","I grew up watching ALL of Abbott & Costello's movies & have spent a lot of money collecting them. This is one of the hardest ones to find, but it's also not one of their best. Charles Laughton had so much admiration for the great comedy duo that he was determined to make a movie with them. In fact, his funny performance is one of the best things about this musical version of Captain Kidd. This & ""Jack & the Beanstalk"" are the only color films Abbott & Costello ever made, & both seem more like musicals than anything else. This movie is good, clean entertainment for the whole family, but be aware that this has not been properly restored & the film quality isn't great. Still, for Abbott & Costello fanatics like me this is worth having!"
3,There is a copy that is great,"I have to agree with most of the rundown reviews reguarding Abbott and Costello meet Captain Kidd. The VHS version has very poor pix quality. However, I found a copy way back when ever, don't remember when I got it, but it was on the Beta format. I still have it. I don't know if it was retouched or if it has something to do with the better quality Beta had over VHS. It looks almost as good as todays DVD copies of the B & W movies A&C have out now, I have copied mine over to DVD a few times and it does not come out quite as good as the professionals might get. However, if any of you out there run across a Beta version of Abbott and Costello meet Captain Kidd, then I suggest you snap it up asap. Of course this suggestion is only good for the people who were smart enough to hold on to there Beta players."
5,Love Abbott and Costello,"Not a fan of musicals - but I love Abbott and Costell - if your a fan, you'll enjoy this one."
5,Yeah What a game.,"this is one bloody , hard game with so many passages, tunnels lt. ripley had alot of prisoners to save before the time runs out that the tricky part . the first level is ok not really hard , it only gets harder as you go along through the levels oh & watch out for the face huggers they'll suck the energy out of you fast. this game is challenging but a brain worker non the less i highly recommend it for fun."
3,Alien 3 had no weapons right but this game does,The 1992 movie starring Sigourny Weaver had no weapons and went back to 1 Alien but the game has lots of Aliens and a pulse rifle a grenade launcher & a flamethrower yup this has the weapons from Aliens the previous movie. But this is a good game you can have up to 9 lives and your going to need them too. You have to run around and save prisoners from being face hugged and your on a timer & when the timer runs out you have to play the level over but when you lose all your lives & get a game over you have to start over from the beggining but there is a level select code that comes in handy I don't really feel like starting over from the beggining of the game yup it's a hard game but very good and the ending is happy when the ending in Alien 3 was kind of tradgic.
2,An okay platformer...,...though increasingly tedious and a bit dull. As usual for film tie-ins of the time it had little do with the story of Alien 3. Ripley runs about with a big gun (there were no guns in the film) shooting at loads of aliens (there was only one in the film) through many different levels.While the levels looks good and had a decent atmosphere about them it looked nothing like the Fury-161 prison/refinery of the movie and all you really did in them was jump from platform to platform and go up and ladders. Occasionally a Xenomorph would rush and knock you over if you didn't blow it away. It became really boring after a while and only those with seriously nothing better to do would be able to stick it out until the end.And why is Ripley alive at the end?
5,Better than the Game Boy version,This is the same game that is available for GameBoy Advance but has better graphics. It is just as fun as the GBA version but can be played on a TV screen.
2,Shostakovich murdered.,"I like Victoria Mollova, but this tape contains something that should be seen perhaps for the musical terror. Shostakovich symphony 5, which is regarded as ""the greatest"" symphony of all Shostakovich's symphonies, is conducted by his son, Maxim Shostakovich, who should be arrested for what he did with his father's symphony on this tape. For a musician it is essencial to see this tape, for then one can know how a conductor can turn great music into terrifying embarrassment. For non-musicians, it provides at least some amount of fun to see Maxim jumping on the podium while conducting. Poor Dimitri, thank god you're not here to see your son conducting your masterpiece. END"
2,"Best FNM album, Crappy remake","Seriously, this CD cost more than 3 normal cd's would at any store. Bragging about it's Gold disc and ""Original Master Recording"". Well, it's crap. The original sounds better to me and didn't cost 1/10 of what this did. What FNM needs is to REMASTER this glorious work and forget this OMR ever happened. Dissappointing. Angel Dust is one of my top 5 ""can always listen to anywhere"" cds and has been since it's creation back in the 90s. To do this disservice is just sad."
1,Incomplete information,"Though this manual provided general information on the Windstar, it's wiring diagrams lacked detail. I've been trying to toubleshoot a door ajar signal that won't turn off. The book didn't even mention the sensors location! It did mention how to adjust the door, but until I've identified the problem, that information is useless. I expected more."
1,Worst Chilton's manual yet,"I've basically liked the Chilton's manuals in the past, but this one for the 1995 Ford Windstar is horrible. Everytime I go to reference it I can't find an answer."
1,2 thumbs down,I bought this book to fix an air bag problem on my 97 winddstar. It was of no help at all. How can i return or exchange this book for something that would help?
3,call for help,"To the Gainesville FL person who tried to repair an air bag. Please call Nichols about the Chilton TCC at 800-695-1214 and an editor will speak with you about the airbag problem. Our people always try and help when needed. However, dealing with airbags can be very touchy and should only be done by an experienced person."

5,Al Farabi in context,This is an excellent source on a difficult subject. Islamic neoplatonism is a complex web of ideas made quite accessible by this book. Thankyou for the scholarship it must have taken to present it.
3,disappointing ending,"I loved this book until the ending. It feels unfinished, as if it were the first book in a series that never was completed."
5,Everyone should read this book!,"It is very rare indeed when a book can take your breath away and make you weep. When a book can transport you to a time and place you have never been. Well, this book does that and much more. It is beatifully written and full of very relevant insights. It truely is a perfect book and one that you will not be able to put down. It really helps you to understand the utter horror of what was going on in Germany in the late 1930's. I really cannot say enough about this book, please read it, it is a very important piece of work. I feel honored to have read it."
5,Reads like a novel,"I met the author at a conference and bought her book. I started it right away and had trouble putting it down. The past is not a thing that can be re-created; it is a story to be told and Ms. Chapman has told her story, and her mother's story, and the story of so many others, extremely well. And it is an important story: the effects of the Holocaust upon the next generation, and upon Germans who would rather forget all about it, and upon children who know next to nothing of what happened to their grandparents. I recommend it to everyone!"
5,Tears through the years,"A most beautiful book. A gift from all children to their parents, and to our children. A must read for all. From the sadness, we are re-borne, knowing we must survive. That this may never happen, ever again. We see not only the Jewish sorrow of the Holocaust, but also the damage done to Germans, and the world. We may not have made the journey in the same ship, but we are in the same boat. God bless you Edith and Fern."
3,a good book,"I enjoyed this book. It was an interesting perspective on a visit to a hometown, and it definitely had its touching moments. I read it a while ago, so I don't remember it that well, but I do know that I thought it was a very well written book. It's not really my type of book."
3,Comentario Sobre la Edicion En Dvd de Olvidarte Jamas,"Me Gusto el Dvd aunque debo reconocer que esperaba mucho mas, sobre todo del comienzo de la Historia, faltan mucha partes importantes, quitaron muchas escenas.Por otra parte al igual que el Dvd de Angel Rebelde y Acorralada no tiene el Tema Principal en la Entrada si en las Escenas de Amor, que contradictorio no?.Los Creditos de Daniel Elbittar y Mariana Torres los quitaron de la Entrada para sacar a Pablo Montero que aparecia originalmente en la Presentacion y algunos otras capturas.Sin ser eso, lo demas me gusto."
1,"2nd Cd was completely damaged and could not be seen, 3rd cd was partially damaged and could only see parts of it.","The 2nd second CD was completely damaged and could not be seen, the 3rd CD would play but had a lot of places where you could not see a thing.I will never order from Amazon.com again. This was my first order, ever.Thank you for giving me this opportunity to address this issueThanks!Sally G."
2,Dangerous when applied to all PTSD sufferers,I am aware of patients suffering from severe PTSD who have become markedly worse when the therapist encouraged regression and/or full recovery of memories as a means of healing. TIR may work for some people. It may push others over the edge. No technique is capable of healing everyone with PTSD and no technique should be used which might increase suicidality or other serious symptoms.
1,Where's the soundtrack?!,"This movie was very touching and a big part of the emotion for me was sparked by the ORCHESTRAL pieces, not the collection of vocal numbers here, most of which I don't even recall hearing. I'll be buying the DVD when it's available as much for the story as for the music that helped make it memorable."
2,IMPORTANT: This is NOT the Score soundtrack from the movie...,"I watched the movie and its the music that is so powerful. So if you want the music from the movie, you have to buy the SCORE Soundtrack from the composer Bennett Salvay. Check the iTunes Music Store...great music!About the Original Soundtrack; have to say just checked some songs - not very inspiring..."
2,Where's the orchestra?,"While I'm sure these vocal songs were chosen from the movie, I'm not really sure why. There are no orchestra pieces on this soundtrack even though it was the orchestral pieces in the movie that were the most effective/emotional/memorable/etc.In fact, I don't remember any vocal pieces in the movie. Maybe these pieces were what he was listening to in his motorcycle helmet in the movie, but we just couldn't hear them?Release the orchestral version please."
1,"If you saw the movie and want the soundtrack, FORGET IT","I wish I had read the other reviews. I saw the movie (very strange) and was captivated by the powerful music as Dan swung on the rings. I wanted THAT music, and I foolishly bought the ""soundtrack."" There is NONE of it here. This is a bunch of singing and guitar, with a voice clip from (the real) Dan in-between each piece.Did the movie even HAVE any sung pieces??? I don't remember any. What I remember were the powerful orchestral pieces. The other pieces are certainly unmemorable.If you saw the movie and really liked the singing (what singing???) then buy this. If you want the great orchestral pieces, forget it!!!"
1,Boring.... Boring... Boring,This album is so bad that I donated it to the goodwill. Hopefully someone will buy it for $1.00 and enjoy it more than I did. I had to listen to the snipppets before making this mistake.
1,Almost worst ever media,I have tried using these on a SONY RDR-GXD455 recorder and get a 90% failure rate when I try to finalize these these making all the recordings and disk totally unusable. I have burned through more than a spindle's worth with the same result. It was a great waste of time. I have since switched to Memorex with no problems at all.
1,"RENT is a farce, a colonization by straight, american LIARS","Jonathan Larson borrowed almost every detail from a book called ""People in Trouble"", by Sarah Schulman, a REAL artist, and then sold it back to straight, money-hungry ""art"" dealers while glossing over the real truth about gay men and women, and AIDS to sell a LIE back to the general public. This is absolutely disgusting that the theatre world could allow this to happen! Look into Sarah Schulman's book ""Stagestruck"", Open your EYES!"
1,"RENT was written by Sarah Schulman, NOT J. Larson!","""Stagestruck"" by Sarah Schulman, addresses not only the fact that RENT was stolen and repackaged by Jonathan Larson, but also examines the selling of a fake public homosexuality and an existence/acceptance of the AIDS epidemic that does not exist. The book explains step by step the TRUE story behind Jonathan Larson, and how he borrowed, stole, and most importantly created a world of LIES for the masses to feast upon. ""...Oh RENT was so moving!...It changed my life!..."" The same things people said about ""Titanic""! Wake up and get the REAL story."
5,"truly brilliant, an inspiring tale, and a brilliant musical","This book is brilliant. Not only is Rent truly the best musical ever to hit the big stage, but it has an amazing story to go with it. Johnathan Larson is inspirational in this description of his perseverence, dedication, and belief in himself. This book gives brilliant insight to the heartwrenching musical, and also to this extremely talented creater, to whom I am eternally greatful for his commitment which led to the best modern day musical of our time."
5,A must own for RENT fans,"I always wondered if the book was worth the money for a show I had only seen once, but after receiving it as a gift and continuing to see the show a few more times I am so appreciative of having it on my shelf.This book is far more than a program. It captures the style and excitement of the show in its layout, photos, and writings and also does a nice job of explaining the history and meaning behind the show.If you love the play, this book will help satisfy your passion for the work."
4,Great Book but needs a tad more glue!,"I simply loved Larson's RENT since I had gotten the CD. As a Renthead, I HAD to have this book. With fun candid photos of the original cast and an eyepoping layout, I absolutely love it. However, my only problem is that it is very hard and heavy to carry. However, It is a FANTASTIC book and well worth getting. A real treasure for the ultamate Renthead!"
3,No musical score :(,"I love Rent, and this is a wonderful book if you love Rent. BUT I was also looking for the score (sheet music). All this has is the libretto (words only). I can only find songbooks that have highlights, not all the songs. Disappointing."
5,"""No Day But Today"" This Book Is, One Word, Brilliant!","Wow! RENT, I'm a 17 Year Old Guy From SoCal, and I Have seen the Show About 4 Times, 3 Times in NY, and Once In LA. This Amazing Story has so much meaning, to me, and the other RENT fans. If you are a hardkore Rent Fan, why dont u have this book? If Your as captivating with RENT, as the rest of us are, please purchase this book, and the Amazing Soundtrack, and if your a fan who doesn't live in a big city, look for the North American Tour dates!!! =) *Peace*"
5,La Vie Boeheme!,"Of all all the Broadway ""coffee table"" books, RENT ranks first. The background on Jonathan Larson provided so much more perspective than I had ever imagined.As a teacher, I have used the RENT book in my classroom, and have had all of my classes singing and dancing to ""Seasons of Love.""As an adolescent of the 60's, and a young adult in the 70's, HAIR and A CHORUS LINE were the most important theatrical memories of my life.As I approached middle age over night, and just when I had been losing faith in the musical theatre of the late 20th Century, RENT came along, and provided me with not only hope, but with a renewal of my own life.The photographs are as vivid and as passionate as sitting in the Nederlander Theatre.The RENT book will be a salient addition to my library, and I will continue to celebrate ""La Vie Boeheme!"""
5,SIMPLY ESSENTIAL,"An absolute necessity for any renthead. only complaint is it is written early on in the broadway run but really that is the end of the story mostly.rent has etched itself into my psyche like a weevil. there is not a morning that i wake up that one of the songs is not in my head. i sell music and i have never came across a group of music that has had this effect on me.perhaps the story of larson's early demise colors it and adds that extra tragic twist that keeps it inside your soul but whatever it has provided the most joyus ride into musical bliss that i have ever experienced yet.(move over ""pet sounds"", ""west side story"", ""toy matinee"" & ""eli & the 13th confession"".the book is laid out well, quite informative. even has comments from the pit band (who are essential).GET THIS if you have to futher feed your rent needs.viva la vie bohem."
1,Scratch-o-rama,"Look, contrary to the above, this case isnt the greatest. When i first took it out of the package, it a had a huge gash on the inside of the &quot;vinyl&quot; cover. Then, after a few days, the top drawstring material had turned the base of the plug for the headphones that comes with the iPod black. IT TURNED IT BLACK!! the cloth had rubbed off black dye onto the plug! And then, after a week or two, the &quot;vinyl&quot; (your lucky if its low-quality plastic) began sticking to the front of the ipod, leaving ugly little air bubbles. Also, if you keep it in your pocket, lint gets in easily and sticks to the plastic. And not to mention insertion! It took a few minutes to get it in, and after 5 minutes, the iPod was crooked! i had to take it out and put it back in to fix it. The reasons I gave it 1 star was because it DOES protect the iPod's steel backing from being scratched and 0 stars wasnt an option."
2,There's got to be a better case!,This case does not protect from scratches! My screen is somehow scratched up and I always have it in this case. Also the bottom opening isn't big enough for the monster digital tuner/charger.
1,stupid case,"i hate this case! i made a better case than this and had more luck! first of all, there is no hole for the click wheel! even though u can still use the click wheel, its easier to use it when its out of the case. Like most cases, it colected a lot of dust, but that is the least of my worries. also, the ipod is impossible to get out of the case without (A) scratching the Ipod and (B) permanately bending the case so it doesnt fit right. Keep looking for that special case, its out there somewhere. I hope."
4,"Can't go wrong if you like mellow, melodic piano jazz","The songs exude fluid, innovative piano in a trio format with solid backup. The songs are lilting, almost nostalgic, sometimes with a haunting undercurrent, that do have that title feeling of returning back to some comfortable place in the distant past. Nice album. For my own tastes a bit too low key for the most part (a couple of more upbeat numbers are in there), but, none the less, very well done."
4,Very enjoyable,"This is some top-notch jazz. First of all, there is wonderful interplay between these three very creative instrumentalists. Secondly, the recording is very clean and natural. Turn it up to the appropriate volume level and it sounds like they're in the room! The only drawback is the vocal on Homebody. After all of the top-notch instrumental musicianship, the singing is a little mediocre. Nothing against vocals in general. As an instrumentalist myself, I have grown to respect greatly the art of singing well. It's not easy. That's why I usually leave it to the vocalists. But, this is Bill Mays singing. He's not terrible, but his piano playing is way better. The last song is the only one with vocals, so it doesn't hurt the quality of the music much."
4,Still some of the best norteno around.,"The norteno kings deliver with heartfelt ballads like ""Ayudame"" and ""Voy a Tener Que Olvidarla"" (which somebody should cover pop style) and give us another winning cumbia with ""Para Que Volver."" They stay a step ahead of young imitators with their laid-back, cohesive musicianship. But as successful as the Intocable/Jose Luis Ayala/Louie Padilla hit machine is, the group is essentially rehashing its tried-and-true formula of low, soft verses building up to choruses that inevitably contain the song's title. Much of it remains potent and catchy, but a five-star album doesn't play it safe; it takes risks."
3,Magnets aren't as strong as other Checkpoint levels.,"This level was a little bulkier than I expected. I do find it useful, but am overall disappointed by this level. My biggest complaint is the magnets. Usually, Checkpoint levels have very strong magnets. On this one, however, they're not very strong (they won't hold up a stick of conduit for example). The level is significantly bulkier and heavier than a standard Checkpoint level. So, its weaker magnets are peculiar. I use my level primarily for bending conduit, but this level isn't very good for that since it needs at least three of its four magnets to secure it to the pipe. It does seem solid and durable, and I like the bull's eye level on the top of it. I have also found the laser function useful. I won't give it a high rating, however, do to the weakness of its magnets."
4,A real labor saver!,"As an instrument and tubing installer in the construction of off-shore drilling rigs, I rely on a good level to make my tubing level. I should have had one of these long ago! It has been a great help in running support tray and tubing over wide gaps and long distances and still keeping everything ""on the level"". I shoot the laser from one support to another (regardless of distance), make my mark and ""BAM"" - it's level! No more guessing or make-do extensions when my 2' or 4' level ""came up short"".I highly recommend one if your job requires accuracy.JGLIngleside, TX"
1,crap,there are many better sega genesis games out there like sonic the hedgehog and golden axe plus streets of rage the controls suck and is boring the music also sucks buy beyond oasis
2,NOT up to her usual standards,"I've got to start by stating that Diana Wynne Jones is one of my favorite authors - I love most of her books. But I was very disappointed in this one. The best description I can come up with is ""confusing and boring"". The characters are uninteresting and the plot uninvolving. Her attempts at humor (usually very adept) fall flat and the whole thing feels incredibly silly. I had to skip long dull sections just to make it 3/4 of the way through the novel before giving up. I hope this isn't a taste of Jones books to come."
2,THE MERLIN CONSPIRACY by Diana Wynne Jones,"I have heard from my sources that novels by Diana Wynne Jones are remarkably enjoyable, though very whimsical. When I read The Merlin Conspiracy, I was expecting a lot more than I got. The book, to me, was extremely boring and monotonous. It was very hard to finish, and I had to skip many pages at a time in order to complete it. In my opinion, this book was not an example of an exeptional science-fiction/fantasy book. The Merlin Conspiracy is not a book that I would reccomend to sci-fi/fantasy fans who are expecting a lot from reading this. I would, although, reccomend the Merlin books by T.A. Barron and the Deltora books by Emily Rodda. The Merlin Conspiracy by Diana Wynne Jones gets a simple two stars from me."
3,The Merlin Conspiracy,"This book wasn't one of Diana Wynne Jones's best. It could have been much shorter, and didn't tie up some of the loose ends. It didn't tell what some of the creatures really were, although it talked about them a lot. However, it's possible that this could have not made sense to me because I didn't read the prequel, ""Deep Secret"". It had a very interesting plot, though, and certainly wasn't a slow mover."
2,"The Merlin Conspiracy....sounds like a cool book, right?","To start out with, it's not nearly as good of a book as it sounds like. I got the book thinking that it would be awesome, but, once again, I was wrong. The book is very hard to follow, switching through two different, yet very much alike, stories with little explanation of why until very late in the book. The story starts out kind of boring, then builds up, and just when it seems like it's going to get really cool, it drops back to boring. To put it bluntly, this book is nothing great."
1,What do I do now?,"Don't, I repeat, don't buy this product. I replaced my charger with this one, and it burned out in one hour. Now, I'm stuck with a power screwdriver that can't be used. What has Skil done to their charger? What am I going to do with a product that I can't use?"
1,Do Not Buy,"I read all the bad reviews for this product and ordered it anyway. I thought that with all the negative reviews they must have impoved the product or why else would they still advertise it. Well it's still a piece of junk. It did not charge my batteries, the plug got so hot I could hardly touch it to unplug it from the wall socket and the charger just burned itself out. Of course I returned it. Amazon was very good about the return and promptly credited my account and refunded the shipping charges. That is the only reason I am giving it one star."
1,junk,Plugged it in to charge the new battery. Seemed OK but --- never worked again. Red LED indicator light doesn't light up when battery is inserted.
4,FlexCharger,This works great. I like a dual battery charger which allow me to alway have a reserve battery to use when I need it. It is alway a good idea to have a spare battery in-case there is times when the use of a tool require long period of battery usage.
2,My second one - worked for a while..,"I just fried my second charger. Same problem as everyone else has had. The little cube doesn't even have straight sides any more.Basically, this is a cheap 120 VAC to 3 VAC step-down transformer rated at 300 ma. I am going to replace it with this:[...]which is for camcorders and supposedly has more than 1000 ma capability. I'll just cut off the burned out one and splice in the Teac adapter. We'll see..."
2,battery charger failed,"The Unit charged the first time and then quit. I sent it back and was refunded in an orderly manner. Pleased with Amazon for the ""no Hassel"" return."
1,Poor engineering,"I just bought a new charger to replace the one that burned up.The previous one was for a single battery. It appears Ihad a bad battery which I suspect may be shorted. Anyhow, thenew two battery unit shorted out the primary coil the firstday and is no longer usable so I'm having to purchase anotherunit. This will be the third charger unit. It would havebeen nice if the unit had some sort of fuse or overload protection but it doesn't."
1,Worked one time then poof...,"In general I was happy with my purchase until I used it for the first time and the power adapter burned out. With me paying over $20 for it, I just didn't want to take the time, hassle, and shipping cost to send it back. Online purchases are great, but if you have a problem they are the pits! It's a real gamble...I would not, and have not purchased another one."
1,Defective Skill Flex battery chargers,"Ordered two battery chargers, out of the box one worked, one did not. Returned defective for an exchange, the exchange did not work either. The first one is still working. Items appear to be factory new but of poor quality."
1,Trash...stay away,"I tried not to believe other reviews but ended up wasting my money. If I could give a negative number of stars I would. I went through two of these chargers before I learned my lesson. Bite the bullet, throw out the tools that use this battery and update your workshop. Trying to continue using this battery system is useless and dangerous."
5,Dual Battery Charger,It was great to find this online as the stores no longer seem to carry it or the batteries any more. Thank you.
1,Amazon transposed the item numbers,Amazon transposed the part numbers and shipped me the wrong item. I ordered No. 92490 and received No. 92942
4,Not just for job seekers,"This book is not only for job seekers to get a job in Citibank, but also for those who are interested to know more about how Citibank selects its most important asset, human capital.Also this book will tell you why some promising bankers in the making may not necessary able to fit themselves into Citibank criteria of selection despite the belief that Citibank is an excellence training ground for future leading bankers. To know why, read this book.BL"
5,Still available!,I'm so glad this carafe is still available for my 15-yr-old Cafe Bistro. It seems like I break it every year!
3,A good stretching dvd,"I am used to doing yoga that moves more quickly, but I suppose that this dvd is for therapy and not weight loss. I like the lower back routine, but the hip routine hurt for days afterward. I very well could have been doing it incorrectly, however, I didn't get the results that I anticipated. I will continue to use the low back portion, but will stay away from the hip instruction."
2,viniyoga for low back,"Disappointed. Thou it was a how to do each pose, I expected one of the 'actors' to actually run thru doing several of them right after one another so you could follow along. Not the yoga tape I was looking for."
3,not bad,"The video is more suitable for people with less active life style. There are three exercise sessions in this video, each one is roughly 30 minutes long. It is recommended that you'd better get used to the first two exercises before doing the strongest one. They have positive effects and the instruction is clear. But in my experience, they are all too light."
2,Information good but quality of sound not great,The information contained in this video is good - but I was disappointed in the sound quality.....perhaps it was just my copy.
5,Boring exercises but supremely effective,"Length:: 1:49 MinsI hate doing this yoga DVD because the exercises are so boring and the narrator's voice drones. But I return to it time and time again, because it's the only thing besides a Chiropractor visit which fixes my hips and gets me aligned and ready to work again. It is extremely effective.Suck it up, buy the DVD, and use it regularly, and your hips will thank you."
5,The Best!!,"I had a baby a year ago, and have been having this nagging lower back pain since then. Swimming helps me a lot, but cant do it all the time. This video works instantly when i have pain which is so bad, i cant walk. There is an instant warm feeling in my lower back after im done with the first 2 sessions. For me its like a massage that i can give my lower back after a whole day of physical labour. I am looking forward to strengthing my lower back once and for all in my life.i am planning to buy the one for the upper back & neck as well."
5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,"I am 54 years old and have had lower back pain for many years. After three weeks of doing these exercises, the pain is about 90% less and getting better every day. I plan to continue to use these videos every day for the rest of my life. I highly recommend this DVD!"
5,back pain video,very good DVD. Very good explanation of the reason of back pain. I have chronic back pain for a while now and this DVD help me feeling better.
1,yoga,"Much too difficult for a beginner==gave it to a younger person.I would not recommend this to anyone more than 30,"
3,Not exactly what you expect,I thought from reading all of the positive reviews and really no negatives that this was exactly the product that I was looking for.I was in a car accident over a year ago and have 2 herniated discs and a messed up pelvis/sacrum. I have done constant therapy for the whole year with three different people. It could always get me better to a certain point and then I would backslide all the way back to where I started. I was told by an orthopedic doctor that I needed to have a sacroiliac fusion. You are out of commision for three months. That is not very appealing. I ordered this video hoping that it would work and it basically just offers stretching excercises that my PT already had me doing so it really did not help me. I think for some people it probably works well I am just usually the exception to the rule. I am going to try Prolotherapy next hopefully that will give me some relief.
1,can't say,Received one DVD which was defective--didn't play at allReceived a replacement--same problemVery disappointed as I love Kraftsow's other DVD
4,It's Okay.,"This DVD is okay. All of the exercises are simple you just have to watch it first and then try the exercises otherwise you might not know what he's talking about, if you're not familiar with yoga."
3,Viniyoga DVD,"I received this item in a short time. It arrived in good condition. I was impressed with the amount of information that's on this dvd. I watched it and did what I usually do when it comes to exercise--nothing. However, when I am more motivated (perhaps when my sciatica worsens), I plan on doing the exercises. I believe that this will make a big difference in my quality of life."
2,"Too much child pose, no alternative","Tried it, once. Not a success. Given the standing on knees, child pose...etc...my knees screamed NO NO NO! Unfortunately, there were no alternatives (yes, I could create one, but hey--that is what I bought the DVD for right?) His voice off-putting, but would have kept except I had to go to acupuncture to right what this wronged."
1,Don't recommend,"The narrator has too little enthusiasm and is monotonous to listen to. Peggy Cappy is much, much better IMO. Go there. I've seen her DVD (two discs) and it's better!"
5,Excellent!,"I am a powerlifter and was having problems with my hips being tight. They were so tight and I was having so much pain that I could not get into the proper stance for deadlifting and squatting. Because I am such a believer in yoga, I searched for a yoga DVD that would help my hips. How lucky I was to have found this one!! The exercises at first seemed so simple compared to my heaving weightlifting and regular yoga practice, but they have made a tremendous difference in my hips!! For the first time I do not have to be careful how I move my legs when I get up from a seated position. Before the DVD I would have extreme pain in my right hip upon rising up from a chair or getting out of the car. When I am finished with these exercises my hips feel rejuvenated and truly stable. I simply cannot praise this DVD enough!! And my trainer has noticed that my form in deadlifting and squatting has greatly improved! Thank you Gary Kraftsow!"
5,Finally found a cure for lower back pain,"If you are looking for a ""fun"" funky kind of yoga tape this is not it. But if you are looking for relief from low back pain, a stop to back spasms at random and the ability to return to being active, then this is the yoga tape for you.I am a huge fan and have been using this tape as well as the MP3 when traveling.Highly recommend"
5,Excellent instruction,"Excellent and thorough instruction and not at all difficult to follow... I failed with other yoga attempts, but I can actually perform these exercises and feel they make a difference in my post-back injury flexibility."
4,Better than expected,"Reccommended by a friend with back problems, I was skeptical at first - but even I could do these exercises...and they really helped."
2,A bit too slow paced for me.,I like it but i feel it's too slow for my taste. Good for beginners and those currently with low back or hip injuries/ pain.
5,really helps sciatica,"When I committed to doing the ""hip therapy"" program on this DVD daily, I finally got relief from my sciatica pain (after trying a lot of other measures). It's very helpful to have exercises that specifically target a problem area. Fantastic DVD!"
2,Disappointed.,"Viniyoga Therapy for the Low Back, Sacrum & Hips with Gary KraftsowI was searching for a DVD that I could plug in and do a 30 to 60 minute yoga workout at home as if I were walking into a yoga class. Instead, this DVD was more of a lecture about the style of yoga. Since I already know about the style through some wonderful experiences, I simply wanted to do a workout rather than be lectured to about a workout."
2,Be careful before buying this DVD.,"As a middle aged woman just starting to do yoga, this DVD was too difficult. There are no modifications of the postures for someone who is just beginning and may not be as flexible as the people who are demonstrating. Once the work-out gets going, the positions are repeated too quickly and then it goes right into the next one at a fairly rushed pace. Having to stop/start the DVD was distracting. Yoga is supposed to be partially spiritual in nature and I just found this to be more frustrating than helpful. It was disappointing to spend almost $25 on this DVD to find this out (and to have to pay return shipping for a partial refund.) I would recommend a slower paced yoga DVD if you are new to yoga, are older and/or have painful hips or knees."
5,Viniyogatherapy VERY HELPFUL! Highly Recommend!!!,"After having chronic low back and right leg pain for four years, I chose this DVD to help me recover from surgery. The stretches and exercises have helped me more than anything else! It's very relaxing and effective to release tension in the muscles."
5,Felt better within 3 days,"This is definitely not an exercise video, so don't buy it if you have that in mind. However, the stretches are wonderful and highly effective. I pulled a muscle which was causing excruciating sciatica pain. I was in so much pain, I could hardly walk, sit or even lie down. Within 3 days of doing the stretches on this DVD, I felt a world of difference. I can actually function normally now."
5,Great product,"I have thick, coarse, kinky/curly hair. This product helps my hair to smooth out my hair and gives it lots of shine for a few days."
4,Excellent birds-eye view of Six Sigma,"As a manager with a 4-year background in Statistical Process Control, I cannot agree with the two reviewers that bashed this book. I can't say it's in depth, because that's one thing that it isn't: don't expect it in your Black or Green Belt's curriculum. But if you stick to the title, it will reward its readers (mostly managers, I'd hope). It deals in very clear and easy-to-follow words (even for those of you that have been out of school for many, many years) with what is Six Sigma, what it entails (in terms of cost, benefits, cultural mindset change), how to implement and sustain, etc. It even devotes an entire section to an overview of the statistical tools required to get your arms around Six Sigma for the first time.Again, I'd not use it as a reference for in depth matters, but as a primer on the topic, I think it does an excellent job."
2,"Good tools, but heavy on dogma","While this book has a number of useful tools that can be adapted and/or replicated, it lacks objectivity and a degree of critical thought that lead me to question the author's credibility. If you can sort out the objective material from the ""brochureware"" hype, then the book is a passable read. Phrases like ""Six Sigma statistical tools work like magic to uncover what you don't know"" are commonplace. Unfortunately, very few of the potential short-comings and limitations of Six Sigma are addressed. And since they are barely discussed, there is no presentation of remedies or caveats for said defects."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money or Time,"I bought this book thinking it might be useful to hand to some of the manager's in my company who need to gain a better understanding of Six Sigma. While there are some good points to the book, there are many serious errors in the book. These errors will give the reader bad information and possibly hinder their ability to effectively support Six Sigma project teams. Two examples where the book provides inaccurate or misleading information are in descriptions of process capability and DOE. In summary, this book is a poor introduction to Six Sigma."
2,"Unused vs. ""New""","Although the book appeared to be unused, it was obviously not ""new"" as advertised given its yellowed pages and a musty smell as if it had been kept in a damp storage area for several years."
2,Disappointment,The author seems to constantly reiterate his thoughts throughout the book. While this is helpful in reminding the reader about the advantages of six sigma it becomes annoying when trying to understand how to implement and understand the processes.
2,There must be better out there,"Bought this as a first introduction. It's very, very, high level. Maybe to the point of useless. Six Sigma does have, at it's core, some statistics - it would be useful for anyone trying to learn the approach to understand a few of the basic statistical concepts. There are mistakes in the few numerical examples that are offered, probably creating more confusion than insight."
5,No doubt,"I have tried many different PC speakers in the last years and I can tell, that these are the best for the price. The basses are very round and smooth, the subwoofer doesn't vibrate by itself but makes vibrate all the room! The sound is very rich and well balanced. I guess you can have more, but not for this price.P.S.: It seems very clear for me: if the problem is the shipment you don't have to think that a product is bad for this..."
2,good speaker - subwoofer can be damaged in shipping,"The hardware looks quite nice - however; the subwoofer broke lose from the face plate. I have read a few reviews and they all seem to say - good sound for the money.The Sattlite speakers were unharmed - however, they must be used for the subwoofer.Contacting Philips for replacement subwoofer - or will return to Amazon if Philips can't fix them.Once I get the hardware fixed I will post a follow upBradbn4"
1,Don't buy,"I recieved this item and it was broken in so many ways i can't even begin to explain. oh and to make things better, i tried contacting the company and they were impossible to get ahold of. then, i finally got ahold of them after amazon.com had already reimbersed me. thanks for nothin is all i have to say."
1,very basic,"If you are looking for anything more that basic taekwondo, then don't waste your time. If you are looking for a basic dvd on taekwondo than this will fit the bill. I does a good job of expalining the basics but that's it."
1,Don't believe 'em,"This claims to be the first ""complete"" recording of ""The Grand Duke."" I was so annoyed by the excessive and needless cuts in the music that I didn't even finish the first disk. Instead, I sent it right back with a request for a refund.I'll stick with the fine D'Oyly Carte recording that has just a very few minor excisions."
5,Cervantes Plays With the Man Who Thinks He is The Center of The World,The book is basically a comedy of the man who believes that he is the center of the universe and therefore can ignore what everyone else is doing and make a buffoon of himself while himself not knowing that that is what is going on because he really thinks he has it all figured out. Quixote thinks he's figured out that his life experience is not as an individual human being but as the main character in a world created just for him. This is important because it is a common pitfall in individual human self-thinking.
1,hate it,"I know it's classic, but I absolutely hated this book. I read a lot, and always thought I could read anything. I can't believe I am the only one out there with this opinion...."
2,Just not funny.,"I'm sure it was probably great in its time but now, to me, it just reads as a silly, lengthy, display of low-humor."
2,No Way,"Just started reading this book a few weeks ago and have already given up. By the time I got through to pages before the actual story began, I gave up. No way I'm going to finish."
5,Loved it!,The book came in great condition as advertised. It was exactly what I needed for my humanities class this semester.
2,Kindle adaptation needs some work!,"Click on to to ""cover"" and you get page 1.Click on ""table of contents"" and get . . . something, certainly not the chapter by chapter table of contents you are expecting.Looking for the translator's introduction? It's there somewhere if you can find it. Author's prologue ditto.It all seems to be there (except for the cover) but it isn't easy to find.If I wanted faulty navigation I would have taken the free version."
2,Don Quixote (Penguin).,"OK, yet I have to tell you the font size is too small - and the margins small.I went to Barnes & Noble and purchased a hardback edition that was splendid.Now, I have an extra edition to do something with...?DWilsonjuda5760@msn.com"
5,brilliant funny on mark,"Amazing how some people don't get the meaning of this novel. It is very funny at parts and talks of life with an accuracy thet rings true today. My only guess is that they are reading superficially or are not experienced in life. Take for example, the power of love is described - only a godly force can resist love so your only option is to flee. Correlate that to how when you break up with a loved one your only recourse is 'no contact' to heal your heart.This story is a metaphor of how one man tries to do right and stand up for good. Mostly he fails but sometimes he succeeds when the crowd is indifferent to justice ... as when he defends the beautiful persecuted sheperdess that men only desire out of lust.It talks of having ideas and standing up for them despite the odds, of standing up for the weak and being a hero. The real world has very few heroes."
5,Absolutely delightful,"Funny that despite it's renown, I didn't really know what to expect when I decided to read Don Quixote. It's a sublimely hilarious meditation on the nature of belief, madness, religion, passion, ambition, creativity...life itself.I did have a brief period early on where I thought the 'gag' was getting a bit tired, but that was short-lived, as perhaps I realized (if only subconsciously) that this 'gag' was in fact a profound device with which to consider all of the above topics, and by the end I found myself not wanting it to end.Monty Python, at least 'Holy Grail', owes their life to this book, and in fact I couldn't stop picturing John Cleese as Don Quixote the whole time. And Ricky Gervais would make a great Sancho Panza..."
2,"ruler measurements are off 1/16""","This is a great tool, but this must have been a bad batch. The ruler measurements are off about an 1/16"" so the inch mark is really 1 1/16"". Not a huge amount, but none of the slots line up with the proper measurement."
5,Great Tool !!,"I love my ""Rock Ripper"". It is fast and fun to use and I don't miss messing-up my sheet rock cuts. If you are not a pro it will save you the price in rock and frustration."
2,good,"for the money ,i think it works good.a lot better cut than a tape measure.also easier if you are working alone."
2,Not great as an alarm,"Yes, the look of this clock is great. It is why I was drawn to it, but I wanted an alarm first and foremost. The snooze is only 5 minutes, which is not long enough. After 30 minutes of snoozing, the alarm shuts off completely without warning, so you could be hitting snooze and then it just won't go off again. Also, with the tiny alarm hand it is very difficult to set it to a precise time. You are only able to get a ball park. If you're just looking for good looks, this will work, but not a great alarm."
3,Nice looking radio Bad radio,"I got this radio for its looks and that is just what you get. The snooze button is small, the radio is very hard to tune bad design, and it dose not get many stations very well poor anntena. But it is nice to look at. oh ya and you can hear the clock working at night this is very annoying it has a soft humm like wherrrr-wherrr-klick sound."
5,Very nice,"This is a good reproduction of an old design. This clock has a very solid and weighty feel. The lighted dial has a very soft and old-fashioned glow that mimics a period piece. The plastic body has a satin finish that is also very appropriate. It's large so make sure you want something that has a big footprint. Sound quality is average but that wasn't a priority for me. It's made in China of course, but it's a decent clock for the price."
1,Did not fit,The bow tie had bolts on the back that were drilled in the wrong location. Could not mount it as the bolts would not align to the predrilled holes in the grille. Would not fit my stock grille or replacement.
4,The Camps of Clover Valley,"This is a great book for anyone who is interested in what it was like to live in an 'old fashioned' logging camp during the thirties and forties of the 20th century. It is more about the families and the social aspects in the logging camps rather than the logging industry. Although it does give accurate historical data on Clover Valley Lumber company and many of its operations. All of this is served up from an author with first hand, on the scene, experience."
1,wouldn't buy another infocus!,"I had a horrible time with this product. I paid $1800 for the LP640, fired it up and it went straight back down citing a fan failure. I generated an RMA with InFocus , sent it back , and they sent it right back to me UNTOUCHED! UGGGHH!! I generated another RMA and they replaced the unit with another but this one also had a fan failure. On the eve of an important company presentation they wanted to charge my credit card $3700 to guarantee delivery of a THIRD unit to get here in time for the presentation. I'm getting my money back on this piece of junk and getting a different, cheaper model. I wonder if they had a bad batch or something......."
5,very pleased,This is a great little vest. It is very good for the bones. It definately intensifies a walking workout on the treadmill. You might need to put on a thin long-sleeved shirt. The velcro can scratch a little bit while moving the arms.
1,Unwatchable,I have no idea if anyone in this video could be funny if one were able to hear them or understand what they were saying. It looks like it was videotaped using a home camcorder including the built in mike. The sound is downright horrible. I can't describe how bad this is. I turned it off after 10 minutes and I had paid to watch it. I wouldn't watch it again if it were free.
4,Nice! kid likes it,"It is a good toy set! Feels durable and shoots far, but dont expect the suction cups on the tips of arrows to stick to something except for the glass or any other smooth surface (for sure will not stick to the paper target included in the box)My daughter (7) managed to launch it and it got stuck to the mirror, but she was shooting from a short distance :D"
4,Great training tool,This product is good as a introduction to archery for Juniors. Good as a training tool for young children. Fiberglass construction is good.
2,If you like toys that don't work...,"If you want a cheap toy that doesn't shoot straight and the arrows don't stick to anything - this is your bow and arrow set.It's ok for make-believe but if you want actual practice before moving on to a real set, this won't help you.The non-suction cup ends of the arrows are sharp and cut fingers easily, the suction cups don't stick to anything. You can shoot them or just plain try to stick them to a flat surface and it's no good.I didn't expect much for the price, but I got less than that.On another note, I got a request to review the product and it was deleted stating that my review was not supposed to be about the product but about the delivery, although it states clearly in the request that it should contain product information. The delivery was fine - the product was not."
4,a gift,My grandson really liked his bow and arrow set. It did not take him long to get the hang of it. It is a starter set so if you are looking for something more professional do not stop here.
1,Doesn't work very well,I used this twice since I purchased it. It's not for precision work. Cheaply made and very limited. Flush your money it's less painful.
4,Another too cute book by Kevin Henkes,"I purchased this book for my 3 year old grandson, whose name is Owen.He can identify his name in print and was very excited. The story line was adorable and the illustrations were fun."
5,"""My Favorite.....""","No author captures the essence of a preschooler like Kevin Henkes. ""On Easter monring, Owen's basket was full."" Little blanket toting Owen jumped for joy as he first surveyed and then gobbled down all his ""favorites."" There were jelly beans and gumdrops, buttercream eggs and a big chocolate bunny. And then there was a little yellow marshmallow chick. ""It was the same color as his fuzzy yellow blanket."" And Owen loved it. He didn't eat the chick, but played with it all day. At bedtime, Owen decided to put ""his favorite"" on the shelf with his best toys. Sweet dreams..... Henkes' simple and gentle text is kept to a minimum. The real story is told through his bright and engaging artwork, and youngsters will enjoy the charming facial expressions and special details in each illustration. Perfect for little ones 4 and younger, Owen's Marshmallow Chick is a sweet and tender board book you don't want to miss."
2,very descriptive,"to many descripcion about everything, you misses the storielooking inside , very tipical from XIX century, anyway is a good storie"
4,"Pricing? Amazon, please read!","Yes, its ridiculously expensive and we have been forced to wait forever for this.But also, doesn't the pricing structure seem weird?$27.99 for a 1/2 set, or $59.99 for both? So, by buying both sets together, we are being charged $4 MORE than if we bought them both individually? That makes no sense, since the 2 pack is just the two individual sets bundled together.In a logical world, one should get a discount rather than a penalty for buying both sets at once!If amazon is reading this - fix the pricing or explain the justification for the price increase!"
2,In amazon.co.uk u can get this for LESS THAN $20.00,Don't be a fool. buy this set for less than $20 from amazon.co.uk in which u can also find the complete season 6 for just 16 uk pounds.Why dynasty dvd's are delayed in north america is beyond my imagination.
3,Not quite what I expected.,"I love pinball and I knew that this game would satisfy aportion of the pinball urge I get from time to time. I have a GBcolor and I realize that this game is compatible with GB/pocket & color (all 3 platforms). Color users be warned -- it ain't in color. The other thing I want to share is that this game is not very smart. There are only three different pinball games, and none of them are very exciting. There is no multiball action, no cool ramps, and no way to save your high scrores. The high scores will save during your game play, but once you turn your GB off, then you've lost your score...bogus?..I say yes.I gave this game 3 stars because the 3 levels are kind of fun and I've wasted time playing them with some minor level of enjoyment. Don't be disappointed...I warned you. If you want really cool pinball, I guess you'll have to do what I do: go to the arcade. Happy gaming!"
5,pinball,"the game is great.. personally i love all pinball games from computer versions, to nintendo ones, to the arcades. A must have for any pinball conneseuir"
5,excellent film,I know this was one of her early films and i just wish this would be released on dvd because its a good family film with great acting.
5,Great Movie (A Must See if Your a Shannen fan),"I love this movie, and my family and I watch this every movie night, I love it, it has great acting, and a great story line. If you're a Shannen Doherty fan, it is a must see."
3,Charming Little Film!,"FREEZE FRAME is a charming little film loaded with exceptional acting and drama. Shannen Doherty provides a realistic performance and is backed up by a talented cast. Not only did i like the film, but i was in it (I play the chemist mixing the drugs as you are looking through the steel bars). I must say it was a joy working with Director William Bindley, the cast and crew. It was a top notch operation which is reflected in the film. If i had to recommend a clean and exciting film for my youngsters to watch on a rainy day, this would be it. If you get a chance to see it, do!"
2,DeWalt is Better,"To insert a bit into the Makita Ultralok, you have to pull the collar back and insert the bit--a two-handed operation. With the DeWalt Rapid Load, you just push the bit in as it is spring-loaded. I would give this 1 star, but most of the hex shank holders work the way the Makita does, and the Makita is of good quality. The drill bits are decent."
2,"A Review From an ""Average"" Guy...","This book is what many would call very ""literary.""It is beautifully written in many ways, but in the end it is slow, boring, and tells incomplete tales with little plot.The smallest of inconsequential side items are described with infinite detail, while the basics of communicating meaningful information is ignored.Read it for the writing, read it to experience a different culture, but don't read it for the story."
2,"Beautifully written, but...","I really wanted to love this book. I was drawn in by the cover and captivated by the lyrical imagery, but it wasn't enough.The obvious lack of flow and completeness cannot be made up for with strings of pretty words.There were so many chances to bring the story together, but every attempt either failed or was shunned.As I said, I wanted to love this book, but sadly I was left disappointed and unsatisfied."
2,Not terribly intersting,russell on his hobbyhorse. Very tedious after 80 pages; you have to be very interested in socialism and its beauties to read the whole thing.
5,We All Have The Right To Our Own Space!,"Taking Up Space is a poignant saga of how one woman has come to grips with being large in a society where ""thin"" is worshiped as the ideal. Dr. Pattie Thomas uses her brilliant writing style to share the pain of her battles. Not just the emotional and psychological pain of being large in a small world, but the actual physical pain of two chronic diseases that she has to contend with. In Taking Up Space, Dr. Thomas often refers to herself as the reluctant warrior. But as she shares her battle with personal weight issues; as she bravely takes on the societal and medical stigmas that daily drain people of size, she truly becomes a brave sumo warrior who leads the way into battle against the poison darts that are constantly hurled at us."
4,More than funny with great pictures,"This book was highly recommended in a magazine I subscribe to, and after reading the reviews here I decided to purchase it for my 2-year-old son. It's not in his top ten favorites, but he really likes it - we read it a few times a weekOne nice part of the storyline that I hadn't anticipated was that it clearly demonstrates the ""stages"" toddlers go through with their friends. As all parents of toddlers know, sharing is a very difficult thing for little ones (including duck and goose) to do. This book accurately and comically demonstrates this issue from the very beginning, but gradually the duck and goose begin to share their ""egg,"" realizing that they can both care for it and enjoy having it.I highly recommend this book. I gave it four stars instead of five because, although I can't put my finger on it, I feel it lacks the ""spark"" that makes a book really special. Sorry I can't be more specific."
1,Returned It,"Ok, for me to even consider returning a book, it has to be horrible.This book was boring. It felt like the author was building up, but the end fell pretty flat. I hate to be vague, but there was just something off about the story.I suggest trying this one at a library or brick and mortar store before committing to it. If it works for you, great! If not, you can save a bit of hassle."
4,Duck & Goose -- loveable characters,"This is the first book in the Duck & Goose series, and it's adorable! My husband and I received a couple Duck & Goose books at a baby shower for our first child. I loved those books so much that I bought a few more, including this one.Duck and Goose find what they believe is an egg and immediately start to bicker over it. The bickering turns to planning for the future, then to friendship when they finally realize it's not an egg, but a ball.Duck & Goose has become a permanent part of our baby's library. Even when our baby was only a few months old, he would snuggle in with us and stare at the bright pictures as we read it to him. It's obvious he is fascinated with this book. We can't wait to add to our Duck & Goose collection!"
1,Was not as described,"Granted I paid very little for this, as you they say you get what you pay for. But after receiving it, I found pages where misses, about 6 pages? Was disapointed. Had I known it was in this condition I would've had bought it anyway based on the very low price but would've liked the heads up on actual condition. Thank fully I'm creative and could fill in the pages and my toddler doesn't care."
4,Excellent Reference,"A wonderful book for anyone needing to know basic table manners. This book covers everything from which silverware to use, to what to do and not to, to how to signal completion of a meal, to the appropriate manner to converse at a formal dinner setting.Well illustrated, instructions given in a non-condescending manner. With the current level of knowledge about table manners, I'd say this book is suitable for anyone, not just teenagers."
3,Good book. Horrible condition.,"When I got the book, I was so happy. It took forever to get delivered though. When I opened the package, the book was extremely tattered. It smelled musty and the cover was beginning to fray already.The contents of the book are really good. I love the book itself, just not the appearance."
1,Not All There,"I rate this book very low for its lack of information and explanations. And for my expectation of ""Tiffany's"" to be a premiere source of information.It seems the book was written as a refresher course with the assumption that some basics were covered perhaps in another text.The illustrations are quite poor and some are not clear, especially on how to hold utensils. There was no mention of the use of glassware.There were a number of typographical errors and archaic phrases such as ""mashie niblick"" that left me wishing I had found another resource.Lastly, I would have liked information on how to determine the number of courses or the meal to be served by observing the table setting.Perhaps this was a good resource in it's day, but it needs a lot of updating, in my opinion.I'm only sorry I cannot offer a better book since I thought this would be all we'd need to learn table manners and etiquette...alas"
3,But Is It Polite Enough?,"My personal technique, which I consider the paragon of good manners, is to securely hold the plate at a 45 degree angle, with the proximal edge resting upon the lower lip (no more than 1/2 inch into my mouth mind you).I then straighten my fingers, and stiffen my arm at the elbow in a 90 degree angle, much like a karate chop.I then scoop the contents of the plate into my mouth, with my kung-fu grip hand, making sure to herd as much of the cuisine into my maw as is possible. Any loose particules that may escape on either side of my mouth are thoughtfully caught by the table cloth, the end of which I always tuck into the collar of my shirt.At the end of the meal, I never neglect to considerately roll the end of the tablecloth up, securing any remaining crumbs of food within the folds, and place the bindle in the center of the plate. Always be sure to thoroughly lick your plate clean, so as to relieve your host or hostess of the strain of scrubbing your plate."
2,Not for me... BUT excellent customer service,This wrap was not the best for me... but the customer service I received was stellar! I would buy from this vendor again!
2,Not for me...,"The idea of it was great and i see alot of woman around the city wearing these, but i prefer the bjorn. It was complicated and all the material kept getting twisted in the rings."
3,No as easy as it looks,This was really hard to use once I got the hang of it it was fine but pulling to adjust still twisted and was difficult to pull. I had a very large newborn and he hates it with a passion! Great idea just was not working for us! Wish it did
5,Happy mom and baby,"When I have to take my 4 yr old, his 4 yr old uncle and my baby girl out we always had a hard time, now it is a lot easier to carry her and get the work done. I have a hand to use with the boys and the cart if shopping. It is so nice that the baby is close and can rest while I move around. Love the wrap, it is the best thing ever"
3,Good for what it is,I love the way this wrap looks but in the end I had to use a Moby because the ring sling is just too uncomfortable. My baby likes it and slept well in it and it's a lot easier to breastfeed in than the Moby but I found putting all that stress on one shoulder at a time to be painful and the metal rings always inevitably started putting pressure on me. Even switching arms every few hours didn't help. I still use it if I'm going out somewhere socially because it looks better from a fashion standpoint but for everyday baby wearing it's not my first choice. I'm hoping when the baby is a little older and I want to start wearing him on my hip that I'll be able to get some more use out of it. I'll review it again later.
3,NewMomEBF,"Definitely a beautiful piece of fabric. However, big learning curve. I will wait until I can do the hip carry."
1,WAY too complicated,"It should be a warning when the insert says things like ""practice with a doll first before using on a real baby"" and ""it might be helpful to have a partner with you when setting the wrap up"".I raised an eyebrow at the price, but since it was supposed to be ""so great!!!"" I decided to give it a whirl. Returned it within a week.Way too complicated. Way overpriced. Clunky, awkward, incredibly unrealistic for daily use (even says not to use when cleaning or cooking ???). Seriously, reading the directions on how to set it up with those rings is so complicated it's almost funny if you don't think about the $70 that you just wasted on a piece of cloth and two rings.Baby was uncomfortable and grunting anytime he was put in it. My god, what a waste of money..."
5,Love the Maya Sling!!,"I have been using for 6 months now and my son loves it! It's easy to travel with and versatile. Great gift for a new mom! Comes with DVD to show different ways to use it. My son is 6 months and loves to face forward like a kangaroo pouch. He used to sleep facing me (one of the only ways he would nap as a newborn!), and I can carry my 4 year old nephew on my hip in the sling. Great product!"
1,Too difficult to use,Should be a red flag when you buy something like this that comes with a DVD! None of my friends could use it either. Super cute but just not practical.
3,Fabric,The fabric of this wrap is scratchy and rough. I wish I would have bought a softer one.. I haven't used the sling yet. I just stuck to the Moby wrap which I love.
5,Maya Wrap,I LOVE THIS WRAP!!! I had to get a new one for our 4th child because my last one was recalled. A friend recommended this to me and I am so glad she did! It is awesome!
3,Nice,"I should have checked the size more careful - I was surprised how small it was. The quality is good, and it fits easily into bag or case. Though it wasn't the size I was shopping for, I kept it nonetheless because it was good quality and useful."
2,God for small people,"Good backpack, but I'm 6'2"" and the straps couldn't even make it to my armpits."
2,Too complicated,"It took master's degree to figure out the instructions. Even then the process of the game was so cumbersome, we shortened the game, and have not played it again. I bought it because it was by the same makers of another game I enjoy, but was disappointed."
5,"Thoughtful, well researched and important work","My octogenarian aunt, who grew up in these towns, was delighted to find the lives of her parents and childhood companions described so thoughtfully. This is an important contribution to the history of Colorado and the Rocky Mountain west, and it deserves serious attention."
4,Dansk plates,"I bought these dinner plates to fill some chipped/broken plates in our everyday china. They are first quality, but there is a slight difference in the shape of the back of the plate. This is only noticeable when you stack all the plates together and not at all noticeable when in use."
3,What?,"First off, I love the Newsboys. They're great. But I have to ask: what were they thinking when they released this CD?Please. Buy the original worship albums, Adoration and Devotion. If you don't like the live versions of Lord (I Don't Know) and It Is You on Adoration, then get Thrive as well.Heck, get all the Newsboys CDs. It would be a worthwhile purchase. But why buy this ""worship collection"" when you could get the same songs and then some on already-released albums?"
5,Remo drum heads,Remo drum heads are the greatest I have ever used. They have the best sound and ease of tuning. The smooth white is more durable and stands up to a hammering.
5,Led Zeppelin - live and in top form!,"All live albums should be this good.On ""How the West was Won"", Led Zeppelin has been captured at their peak - raw, loud, swinging, and downright awesome. For those of us who were too young to see this powerhouse quartet play live, this album is about as good as it gets.Unlike some live albums, the band sounds great here. The production is great and the playing is tight as can be. It's Led Zeppelin at their very best, without the studio sheen, playing many of their biggest songs: ""Immigrant Song"", ""Heartbreaker"", ""Black Dog"", ""Over the Hills and Far Away"", ""Stairway to Heaven"", ""Going to California"" (that's merely the first disc) and many others. It's a truly awesome compilation of an incredible live band.""How the West was Won"" captures one of the greatest bands ever at their artistic peak. This album is essential listening for any music fan. Don't be frightened by the twenty dollar-plus price tag. This collection is worth every penny. Pick this up today."
5,one of the greatest live albums ever,"I cant get enough words to describe how good this superb album is.this awesome double live album contains all their hits like rock and roll,black dog,whole lotta love,dazed and confused and the classic.stairway to heaven.hugely recommended with black sabbath's reunion and blue oyster cult's extraterrestrial live."
4,awesome,"best songs- Stairway To Heaven, Rock and Roll, and my favorite........THE IMMAGRANT SONGgood cd"
4,"A very, very, very good live album!","This is the finest live release from Led Zeppelin yet.Great sound quality, really good playing and even some fine vocals from Bob.I wouldn't go as far as to say it's superior to Deep Purple's Made In Japan (which was also recorded in the summer of 1972) but it's really first-rate nevertheless.I'll be playing this live album all summer until Deep Purple's new album ""Bananas"" comes out in late August. Inside sources say, ""Wow! A truly great album"". EMI are evencalling this CD priority one. That's what the industry calls it when a big album ison the way. Oh, what a great year for hard rockin' music."
5,How the West Was Won,"Came highly recommended by a friend and I wished I had purchased it sooner. I was never able to see Led Zeppelin live but if I had this would be the ultimate ""live"" capturing of in concert album that I have ever heard."
4,Led Head,"I believe that this is probaly the best Led Zep Cd around. You get many of there most popular songs live, though Plant's voice my be a little of key at times, but all in all it's an awesome live recording.My only compliant is that No Quarter wasn't included."
4,"Great, except second disc","Everything sounded great, except no DD5.1 on second disc. I like to listen in my car with my surround sound"
5,one of the greatest live albums ever,"how the west was won was one of the greatest live rock albums along with live at fillmore east from the allman brothers.this fantastic live album contains brilliant versions of classics like dazed and confused,whole lotta love,rock and roll,black dog and more.an absolute must have.very very highly recommended.five stars."
5,Buy It. Now.,"I download most of my music.I've burned over 50 of my own CD's.In fact, I've bought any CD's in my entire life - none of them were worth ... for 12 tracks.BUT here. Wow. Three Discs, a compilation of songs that can't be beat (every song here is a gem) and for only ... something dollars, it's unbeatable.You know how good Zep is. This DVD truly bring out their fantastic glory.Buy It.Now.Listen..."
5,Zeppelin at their best,This has to be some of the best zeppelin on tape. Some of their live takes are better than the studio versions. Very tight.
3,"Oh, Yeah!","It seems almost surreal to be driving and ""cranking""NEW Led Zeppelin in 2003!This is truly great stuff and I highly recommendit.Enjoy."
5,Awesome!,A must have for the Zep fan! Incredible look at the band as it improved like a fine wine! A blast from the past that is still fresher than any of today's music.ENJOY!P.S the DVD is excellent!
3,"Amazing Selection, Less Than Stellar Production","The band's performance and selection of songs on this album make an essential to any collection. Though, the sound quality is extremely disappointing. The sound is muddy and flat, making one wonder what, if any effort was put into the production. Maybe it's the best that could be done with the source material. It's hard to beleive that this album with so much potential was done on the cheap, but it makes one wonder."
1,What a dissapointment!,Just got this cd and was truly disappointed by how boring these versions were. Song Remains The Same had better performances than these. Robert Plant sounds awful. Ive had much better bootleg versions of these songs than this. Dont fall for the hype like I did. This aint no 5 star album. Get 1975 Earls Court concert and get better songs and performances than this.
2,"Half decent, spoiled by overblown songs.","1) Great guitaring throughout.2) Robert Plant must be the most overrated vocalist I've ever heard. His fake screeching chicago accent gets on my nerves.3) Moby Dick 19 mins, Dazed and Confused 25 mins...4) Some belting songs.Gutcarter"
1,Average guitar with bad singing,"What is the hype over Page.Page has no original sound because he stole it from the true master,JEFF BECK!"
4,very good buy,"i especially like the live version of ""Over the Hills and Far Away"" which in many aspects is even better than the original version. However some songs lack the intensity of the original versions."
5,Its To Good To Be True,"Extreme Excellence! Led Zeppelin Rules!In the words of James Brown, ""If you have any type of soul feel it! Put you hand on the box and feel it!"" How The West Was Won [LIVE], is the perfect definition of ROCK!I strongly recommend this Master Piece if you are a Led Zeppelin, Rock or Funk fan. If you think, otherwise go watch American Idol Punk!"
4,The cranky reviewer blows,"Did anyone else wonder why the cranky reviewer listened to an album by a band that he thought was so overrated? Pay no attention to this hypocrite. This is a prime example of the juggernaut that was Led Zeppelin. Page IS a great guitarist. While he's never been a precision player, he's always been a adventerous one. This live set may have it's moments of wankery, but nonetheless shows this band at it's tightest. These version sound unlike their studio counterparts and that's the way they wanted it. If anything Zeppelin gets overlooked because of the popularity of their studio recordings. Get this set if you want to hear a band at the height of their powers. Let's hope that Page, Plant & Jones will relent and release more live recordings."
5,Boyfriend loved it!,My boyfriend heard this cd playing at a friends BBQ and liked it so I bought it for him. He loves it!
5,Intoxicating,"Although I have only been a fan of Led Zeppelin since May 9, 2003, when a friend introduced me to the band in his car CD player, I have to say that this band is amazing. After purchasing this CD, I cannot stop listening to it. Everywhere I go I have a Zeppelin song stuck in my head. From an incredibly hard-driving rendition of Immigrant Song to a great version of Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp to a mind-bending Stairway to Heaven, every song on this 3 CD set is Led Zeppelin at their best. And, unlike basically every live album, How the West Was Won actually has Zeppelin sounding better than on their studio albums. To sum it all up, it doesn't matter if you have been a Led Zeppelin fan since their creation, a new fan like myself, or someone who has never heard them play before, pick up How the West Was Won. You'll never get sick of it. It's without a doubt the greatest album I've ever listened to."
4,"Led Zeppelin live...really good, but not their best","I have a hard time giving the Zep less than 4 stars for just about anything. Don't get me wrong, this is a very nice collection, but its somewhat lacking, especially after seeing the DVD set that was released at about the same time. Now that stuff is amazing. The stuff on the CD is just a notch below generally, Page and Plant hit more wrong notes here than on the DVD. Nevertheless, Led Zeppelin live is an experience that is, well, worth experiencing. If you really want to hear some great live material, get the DVD (skip over the MSG show) and you will be blown away. Buy this after you buy the DVD, if you find yourself needing more live Zep, but this CD set falls a little bit short of being essential."
5,Led Zeppelin is the best thing in life hands down,I never used to like Led Zep until one day my friend Mike in 2nd Grade gave me this album to listen . Wow. After my member started erecting after the first few notes played and I had an orgasm I knew that this was phenomenal music! In fact I'm still pinching myself every few minutes to make sure I'm not dreaming. It feels like I've died and gone to heaven. Now I don't bother trying to get a girlfriend and at night I fantatsize about Jimmy Page playing his double necked guitar. Thank you Led Zeppelin for your incredible music. You guys are up thee with Gary Gygax! I highly reccomend this CD to absolutely everyone.
2,im not sure about this one,"This is a very mixed up set in terms of quality of version. Some of these it's like, ""Yeah, this is alright."" Some are like, ""Eh, whatever."" And some are like, ""No, that was bad."" Like the acoustic songs, Robert Plant sounds kinda like he's bored! Now maybe its just me, but I don't like it when they drag out Whole Lotta Love. It's one of those songs where it's just fine at the length that it is. The only REALLY good song here is Immigrant Song. If you want to get it, go ahead, but don't really recomend it."
5,"Thank You, Jimmy Page!","For Led Zeppelin fans, this is a God-send. For the younger set, this will illustrate the power of Led Zeppelin in concert and why they are still one of the best rock bands ever. Zeppelin fans, this is a must-have even if you have the bootlegs. Pagey has cleaned these concerts up and they sound great."
2,Don't buy the hype,"Um, excuse me, but in all this excitment over the ""long overdue"" live CD from Led Zeppelin, have we overlooked the outstanding ""BBC Sessions"" released in 1997? For my money, the BBC sessions are much tighter and exciting than this overblown three-disc set. Don't get snowed by the hype. ""How the West Was Won"" is nothing more than ""Song Remains the Same Redux,"" giving us yet another(!) 25-minute version of ""Dazed and Confused"" and another (!) 20-minute version of ""Whole Lotta Love,"" which sound pretty much like they did when released last time around. There are a few highlights, though -- ""Black Dog"" sounds edgy and mean. The live versions of ""Dancing Days"" and ""The Ocean"" are as energetic and rollicking as the studio recordings."
5,At the top of their game,"I was lucky enough to attend the concerts that are included in this cd. I remembered the concerts as being incredible, but always wondered if the years and recreational drug use had colored my memories. This is even better than I remembered. The sound quality is suprisingly good and the muscular, 70's feel had me head-banging like a teenager all the way home on the freeway. This is Led Zepp at their peak. If you are a Zepp fan, run, do not walk to buy this 3-cd collection. You will fall in love with Zepp all over again."
5,Great live document of a band at its peak,"What can be said about this band that hasn't already been said by generations of adoring Zep fanatics. If nothing else, it seems to set the record straight that they were an outstanding live act; as though this was disputed prior to the release of this album! On the contrary, everyone knows Led Zeppelin was a force of nature when placed in front of a crowd. And these performances, culled from their 1972 tour, show just this. The band tears through their numbers, both electric and acoustic, with precision and recklessness, grace and grit, humility and headstrong dominance. They certainly sound like they own the venue, and the crowd for that matter, when they unleash their blues-based fury. This album also usurps the long criticized The Song Remains The Same and gives fans a live album that finally lives up to the high expectations the band set. Highly recommended."
5,It says what the studio versions couldn't,"This album is 100% live and that's the way it should be. Led Zeppelin was not meant to be heard on professionally mixed tracks. They were meant to be heard raw and reckless, which is basically what their music as all about. With this album, you can also really appreciate the sort of telepathy that seemed to exist between them (nearly half of the music was improvised.) Do you think they planned on busting into ""Mary Lou"" in the middle of ""Whole Lotta Love?"" That is what makes Led Zeppelin so great. Not many bands can say they sound 10 times better live than on their albums. Not to mention Jimmy Page's wild solos. This is a must-have for anyone who thinks stairway was decent on Zeppelin IV. (wait till you hear the live version) Any Zeppelin fan will love disk one, but disks two and three are only for those who have the patience and the appreciation for the 20 minute masterpieces, ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Whole Lotta Love"""
3,Good cd set but not the old Led Zeppelin,"The cd set is good but it does`nt catch the real feel off the time the songs came out.I`ve seen Led Zeppelin many times live,at rock festives,at concerts.When Led Zeppelin frist came out they were raw and powerfull,there music really touched you.This CD the music is rushed and the rawness is`nt there.Robert Plants voice which is always good,does`nt show that rough and raw sound.Jimmy Page`s playing is so much better than this cd shows.If`ve I was wantting to really hear the real sound of this band I`d go out and buy the cd of the older stuff or go out and buy the newer 2pc.dvd which has about 5.5 hours of real life concerts and I think you`ll see what I Mean.Led Zeppelin took me though my younger days and I still think there one of the best bands that made rock great.An old rock head from Seattle"
2,Recorded in 1972 ... and it sure shows,"This concert was recorded way way back in 1972 and sure sounds like it. This is the flatest sounding CD I've ever heard. No bass, no high end, and little seperation! I was hoping that the digital processing could have put some of the magic back in the music but I guess the Jimmy Page the producer was aiming for something else.My Klipsch THX speakers are just sitting there limp waiting for the music to come though but there just isn't anything there.This is a slice of history and all the classic 'Zepp songs are here just not with the punch that I remember them having so long ago."
2,Overrated,"This supposedly hot live albums pales in comparison to the classics like Live at Leeds by the Who and Get Your Ya Yas Out by the Stones. It IS better than Song Remains the Same, but that isn't saying much. I was disappointed."
1,"Why, Jimmy, Why????????","Why didn't you just release the complete, unedited, four hour+ LA Forum show, warts 'n all, after giving it a good remastering? Instead of all the mix-matching in pursuit of some sterile ""perfection"" that is the very antithesis of what Zep was all about?Sure, HTWWW is phenomenal, far better than TSRTS(tho No Quarter is sorely missed) or anyone else's live album. One can only imagine the reactions from the fans who were hearing the HOTH material for the very first time.But I sure feel bad for the people who will never hear the between songs banter, including a lecturing of a security guard; or the Louie, Louie/Everyday People/Thank You medley, for starters. Just a travesty that medley was left off.But, yes, this is well worth buying just for the blazing performances of Over The Hills, Ocean, RnR, Black Dog, & Dancing Days, which are all far superior to the studio versions.The bootleg is called Burn Like A Candle. Well worth looking for."
5,Great LIVE CDs that should have happened long ago,"Why did it take so long?It's a great LIVE set as you would expect from Led Zep, maybe more to come?How about some more studio out-takes Mr Jimmy Page.This CD set plus the DVD will make the surviving members more money than their previous recorded output let me tell you.The sound quality is good for a LIVE recording from 1972.It's the sort of CD you put on a Sunday arvo or at night on the CD walkman before you go to bed.Buy it with the bonus DVD if you can, worth it..........."
2,Worst DVD Audio ever,I have at least 100 DVD Audio and I'm a Zep big fan. DVD Audio is the best format to listen hi fidelity. But nt in this edition. The DVD with DTS is much better this time (only)
3,Noisy; lots of screaming,"Plenty of yelling and screaming, loud electrical noises, and somebody attacking a drum kit with a tire iron."
4,A BRANCH OF TARZEN'S FAMILY TREE,"This is another ""hard to find"" early DAW book. A hint about the story is that Bunduki is Tarzan's adopted son. Also included is the adopted granddaughter of Tarzan. Continuing the saga of Tarzen which was created by Edgar Rice Burroughs."
2,too small,"I brought this belt thinking it was for a waist of 34 ,it so happen that its pretty tight on my waist I have a hard time taking it off because the tongue of the belt is too short, it seems like it would fit a kids waist. The leather is tough which is good but just too small for a 34 waist. If you have a 24 inch waist then this is for you ."
5,L-Ascorbic Face Serum,"This is an awesome Vitamin C for oral intake. However, L-Ascorbic is also the only type of ascorbic acid that works for vitamin c skin serums. I like to mix my own C skin serums because they can oxidize very quickly so I never trust what I get from the stores. Oxidized Vitamin C serum is horrible for your skin and can oxidize long before it turns the tell-tale orange color. Made at home, I know it is fresh. I want it FRESH. Anyway, powdered L-Ascorbic isn't always easy to find. If you are interested in making your own Vitamin C facial serum, there are several very simple and good recipes online. This is a great product and a very good price. As a vitamin supplement, the taste is tart and easily masked in a splash of orange juice."
3,so hard to dissolve.,"I bought this product to make my own vitamin c serum, which I found out is so wonderful for my skin and my pocket, but when I try to dissolve a teaspoon of this product in water (room temperature) is so hard to dissolve, I have to stir and stir and keep stirring for a long period of time, when I finish stirring my arm is so tired, and I am talking doing that for a good 30 to 45 minutes to have the crystals almost but not completely dissolved, I don't know if there's another way to do that without the hassle. I want to give everybody an advice, this powerful and good serum has a downside, my uniform shirt is white color, almost all of them have a yellowish stain all over the collar area, my pillow case got the same stain and bleach did not work, so is better be cautious with this powerful vitamin when is used as a serum for the skin."
5,Good game...good game,"this is an amazing game i have always loved it i used to have it on GAMECUBE and it was good on there until the disc broke so instead of getting a new one i just got the one for PC there is 4 disc's that you use during install and it only takes up a maximum of 3 to 5 GB which isn't much com paired to games like Starcraft 2 which takes like 12 GBi would advise you get a XBOX controller or something with analog stick because it anowing if you use the keyboard (but that my be because i'm used to the GAMECUBE)it works fine computer reads it fine launches it fineordinary game, you have to have disc 1 in the drive to play itthe only downfall is that you cannot play online because EA GAMES has shut down the servers for the gameBut you can still play on LANAwesome buy"
2,Horrendous game and physics,"If you want a good racing game, get GTR2 or WTCC 2007. If you want a fun arcadeish game, get Test Drive: Unlimited. Most Wanted is just horrendous."
4,Good drive for the money,"I have had this game for about 16 months and I still enjoy playing it. The story, once finished, gets old like most games but the driving (and outrunning the cops and competition) is still a blast. There are numerous challenges besides the story line that will challenge your skills at any level of play.The one down side is the online game play. If your connection is even a little slow you will be slaughtered online but otherwise this is a great game to play and is worth owning in my humble opinion."
5,My daily prayer guide for the past 15 years,"This book has always made it back to the top of my book pile on my night stand -- for the past 15 years. It presents a deeply spiritual approach to prayer with pauses for silent prayer and meditation. I especially like the prayers by time of day, day of the week and season of the year. There are prayers for different life transitions and for different moods. I like the focus on nature and on the vastness of the universe as witnessed by contemplating outer space. I am a spirit having a human experience. In this way, I can relate to the concept of a planetary pilgrim. I feel as though my life is a pilgrimage. And my life itself is continuous prayer of gratitude. This book supports me in this perspective. I am grateful for having found this book. It has enriched my prayer life beyond measure."
5,THE BEST!!,"I've owned this book for years and it is my absolute favorite collection of prayers. After sharing parts of it with my priest, I decided he needed a copy of his own, so this purchase was a gift."
5,An EXCELLENT textbook for people new to the subject!,"I am a civil engineering graduate student who took theory of elasticity this semester. I had attempted to learn the subject from a variety of other references, but became frustrated by the incomplete treatment given in most other texts. Slaughter's book develops all topics (including tensor calculus) as needed and explains the solutions to a wide variety of the most common problems in a clear and easy to follow manner. Topics include airy stress functions, Saint Venant warping functions, kinematics, constitutive laws, and the governing equations in two and three dimensions. This book is an absolute MUST for anyone attempting to learn the linearized theory of elasticity!!!"
2,Unreadable due to typographical errors.,"We have a book club hardbound edition of this book. My fiancee tried to read it but only got 16 pages in. The reason is that starting at page 1, and on almost every page thereafter, the word ""air"" appears in the most unlikely places and makes no sense at all. She had me try to decipher it. The best I can figure is that ""air"" is printed every time the author means ""any"". You would think it wouldn't be that big a deal, but it happened so often that the book was complete gibberish and unenjoyable to decipher.I give this 2 stars instead of 1 because it actually looks like an interesting book. I hope that other printings don't have the same error."
5,COMPUTER TECHNICIAN,HiThis book was full of valuable knowledge that I have already learned from college.
1,You thought Watergate was bad!,"Brina (Bernie Coulson) plays a guy who finds out that mobster Al Dorn (G. Gorden Liddy) that is supposed to be dead isn't and spies on him after hearing of his ""evil"" plans. I didn't like this movie very much it was a little amatuerish and the copy I watched had terrible sound."
4,Excellent Set,"I've been working with this set for a couple years now and it has held up well. Very quick bit/ driver changes and great makita quality (I also have a quick change black and Decker set which is not nearly as beefy/ solid). Only complaint is the inside of the case is cheap-- the plastic tray is pretty flimsy. But most of the time I keep the parts as the ""default"" on my drill anyway. You might want to do yourself a favor and get the bigger set-- I wish I did!"
4,Some minor complaints,"The drilling and driving set is well constructed. I dont care the selection of bits and feel it could be more useful if it included a countersink attachment or countersink-equipped drill bits. I also agree that the inner black plastic is quite flimsy.Still, its a good quality set."
2,Disappointing,"Theo Adam was a great singer, but this album does not do him justice. The Lieder represented do not show his marvelous voice to good advantage."
4,I greatly enjoyed this book!,"I have read many books on this subject and this book rates right up there with the best of them. Behrens has a way of drawing you into the subject matter. This book however is not for everyone. Many will not understand it. But that's ok because there are millions of books out there. For those who have an open mind and a love for the martial arts, I recommend this book."
5,The best martial arts book ever written in english,"This is probably the best book ever written in english on the martial arts. The author describes in detail several very advanced techniques, particularly techniques of meditation. He speaks with authority on a number of important spiritual issues and his words have a very strong ring of truth. The test of anyone who speaks on spiritual issues is whether or not they know correct techniques. Behrens passes that test and all the techniques he describes, do exactly what he says they do. Anyone who wants to can experience this for themselves.I highly recommend this book for just about everyone."
1,A Bad book,This is not a good martial arts book. Appears to be written more for the general occult market.Not recommended in any case.
5,Siezure time....Fun time!!,"I was lucky enough to have killer seats to the last show of the Weld tour, bought the CD and video as soon as it came out, but never heard Arc until today. The first few minutes seem boring, then you get hypnotized and the whole mess makes sense. You got to hand it to a guy that can make this noise and also kill unplugged and alone. Put this in your computer and use the visualizations from the windows media player. I recommend battery:hizodge. Just don't drive afterward."
4,Feedback Collage,"Neil Young & Crazy Horse are known as the masters of feedback. On Arc, Mr. Young has compiled a 35 minute sound collage made up of feedback, distortion, drums, announcements and other oddities. The description sounds odd, and the album is, but it is a completely enthralling and intense musical experience. Arc was originally issued as part of Weld making up a triple set surprisingly called Arc-Weld and was a great coda to the intensity of the Weld set. On its own, the set looses some of its relevance, but is still an intriguing and interesting album."
2,This should never have been an album of its own,"In the first pressing of their brilliant ""Weld"" live set, this started out as ""disc 3"". I bought that album after then, and this one to complete the set. Oooooops! I've got nothing against ""noise solos"" within the framework of a larger album. I used to buy Cream and Canned Heat albums with 15-minute drum solos. But such jams as an entire album? There could be an argument that this is Neil's only (I hope) ""ambient"" album. But don't try that argument on Robert Fripp, Brian Eno or David Sylvian next time you meet them. Oh well, it wasn't the most expensive disc I ever bought."
1,arc is crap spelled backwards(don't even ask about the pee),"Arc is some kind of sick musical joke. It is even worse than Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music. It may have been a freebie initially, but I paid for it and it sucks! I think Lou was on crystal meth when he created his opus,but I can't imagine what Neil was doing when he thought that this was worthwhile."
2,"You have to listen ""hard"" to this one.","If you buy this one you must plan on listening alone or possibly with another die hard Neil fan. It takes a few listens to get what he's trying to do and even then it takes some effort to sit out all 30 minutes. This is Neil's version of a guitar in a garbage disposal. If you collect him you'll appreciate some bright ""moments"" on this one."
1,Ugh!,"One of the great things about _Ragged Glory_ and _Weld_ was the moments of extended feedback at the end of many of the songs. For some reason they just fit. With _Arc_, however, Mr. Young snipped out some of the ""highlights"" of the extended endings and edited them together as one long, LOOOOONNNNNGGGGG track.I am a huge Neil Young fan, but there is no way that I can defend a CD composed of thirty minutes of noise. Contrary to some of the earlier reviews posted here, this is NOT art and in no way does it resemble even the most radical Coltrane. Anybody with an electric guitar and a six-pack of beer could have recorded this with the same quality.Yes, Neil Young is a musical genius. No, _Arc_ is not the ""aural poem"" some make it out to be. It is thirty minutes that I will never get back."
1,bad bad bad,"you know when a rock band is playing live and they hit the last note to end the song? Well, this is like that moment just before the hitting of that one note... but it lasts for almost 40 minutes!!!If you like this, well, give a monkey an electric guitar and enjoy!"
4,ARC A OK,THIS CD WILL GET YOU OUT OF BED ON A MONDAY MORNING IN NO TIME. NEIL'S SURREALISTIC COMPILATION OF FEEDBACK BEGETS AN INTENSE SET OF EMOTIONS SELDOME FELT IN ALL OF MUSIC TODAY.
3,Rating depends os standard used,"Musically, I'd give it a 1. But if the review is purpose driven, I'd give it a 5. Only this, Metal Machine Music, and Diamanda Gals are sure fire get the people out of you rhouse right freaking now CDs"
3,vibralite,"The watch arrived very promptly. However, I was disappointed that the watch was so heavy and thick. It functions very well though. A great product for children that needs reminder to self-manage."
5,The definitive Gundam kit.,"This Gundam is simply amazing. It is by far my favorite. This Gundam has great detail, fantastic articulation, its own stand (included in the kit), a shield, two connectable beam sabers, a rifle, four hidden cannons, and adjustable wings. The stand was custom-made for the kit and it looks amazing when display. If you can afford it, do not pass this Gundam up!"
5,BEST GUNDAM EVER,"this is a grate gundam, the freedom is one of the best gundams in the show. Hes my personal favorite. not only is he good looking hes pretty durable. his clam to fame is his wings on his back, they carry 2 gient laser cannons (2 more on his hips) wich can mean you can pose him with those and he can look awsome with them.also, whene the wings aer fully extanded they look just beautiful. I highly recmand you buy this modle. the one down side is that once his wings aer on he has a lot of waght on his back causeing him to fall over."
4,Everybody does need music,I love this cd! Everbody needs music makes me want to dance around like a kid when I hear it. There are 3 songs on the cd one of them is a christmas song but it is nice. The last song is a slower song but it still will have you smiling with it.
3,This is not SACD-DSD! You have been warned!,"You know, SACDs are kinda magnetize interest just cause most of them are subject of superb and detailed mastering work, which is better than a regular CD mastering. Thus it sounds better, and that's why audiophiles, like myself, are ready to pay top price.Do not get me wrong - this product that Amazon advertise as SACD-DSD sounds very good, it is actually an audiophile 24K Gold Super HDCD 24 bit master by FIM. I wouldn't buy it from Amazon since you can find it a little cheaper elsewhere, but I was hoping it is indeed a SACD. But it is not! So you've been warned, and item gets 3 stars. If it would be advertised correctly I'd give 5 stars."
1,Microsoft Navision Help is better,This book is one of the worst IT books i have ever bought in my life. Clicking F1 from any form is better. This book is not worth and it isnt a guide for implementation
3,Useful but scarce. Nice quality-price ratio,"Maybe I was expecting something else. Examples are useful to get a big idea of possibilities. Explanations are short and clear, somewhat poor. Fair as a reference book. Good for consultants and sellers of MS Navision. Not as good for supply chain manager of one specific company implementing Navision. Very good price for what it is offered. Highly recommended to get first contact with the way MS Nav helps to manage the supply chain. Good appendix: useful to handle MS Nav terminology."
5,Was very helpful,"We recently started implementation of Navision, and I searched high and low for a basic book on the operations of Navision. Dr. Hamilton's book provided that overview that I was looking for. There are multiple typical and unique company examples within. I highly recommend this book."
2,Too little info,"This reminds me more of a ""book report"" than anything. It basicallytouched base with the different processes of Navision."
3,Light weight introduction to NAV,"This book provides a light weight overview of the business processes within a standard supply chain environment. It does little to explain the power of Microsoft NAV (formerly Navision). Microsoft Dynamics NAV is a very powerful software platform and I was hoping that this book would provide more insights to leveraging the strengths of the software.If you are a complete novice to supply chain and have zero exposure to NAV, then this book is a good first read. If you are familiar with supply chain and any supporting software product, then this book will likely fall short."
3,Pre-Implementation Overview,The target audience of this book are (project) managers considering a Navision implementation. It provides some useful business cases that demonstrate what Navision can do and the reader will be able to know what points to investigate further prior the project. But the book does not contain sufficient in-depth information to serve as a product reference.
2,I didn't like it,"I was greatly disappointed with this CD. songs all short, around 2 minutes. When you get into some song, it ends."
1,Dark and Gloomy,"After having been delighted by other Laurent Pelly work especially his Offenbach productions, I gave this unknown to me one a try. I found everything about it dark and gloomy and very unpleasant. Watching it once was more than enough whereas I can watch his other works over and over finding something new and delightful every time."
1,terrible,"This is the leakiest harmonica I have ever experienced. I got this for my godson who is six and probably wouldn't know the difference, however if you actually know anything about how harmonicas should sound, this is a joke of a product. I had a pocket pal when I was a kid, and I don't remember it being this bad, but that was before Hohner farmed out its cheap harmonica production to China. Pay $10 more and get a real harp even if you are a beginner."
2,Dansk Allegro dinner set from amazon.com,"I purchased some Dansk Allegro dinner plates, salad plates and saucers as replacements for my set of the same make purchased in 2001. The products I received are of inferior quality: they are thicker, heavier, the height do not match, therefore I had to return the products. As a result I paid for the shipping and handling as well as return shipping costs without purchasing anything."
2,"""It's not you, it's me...""","Have you ever met someone and thought they had lots of good qualities but somehow the spark wasn't there and you never really connected? There was nothing you could really put your finger on -- he/she was a good person, attractive, smart, etc. but it just didn't click. This album is like that for me. I can't say anything is particularly wrong with it, other than that it seems overly sentimental. She has a good voice and it's well produced, but I just don't want to listen to it.Can we still be friends?"
4,This is helping me stay focused,"I'm trying to change my relationship with food (from ""evil, dangerous, failure after failure"") to a healthier version, and this keeps bringing me back to my choices...food, attitude, relationship, emotions."
2,disappointed,"I was looking for a book that would give me daily inspiration, but instead found a book that was of very little help to me. I couldn't relate to most of the information that was written for each day. Very disapointed."
2,Not what I'd thought it would be,"It seemed to focus on how bad it is to eat. Very negative and overbearing. If you need to feel bad about yourself and your eating habits, this is the book for you."
2,Don't Bother with This One,"I'm really disappointed in this book. Most of the days, the entries are not worth my time. Yes, I knew the book would be rather new-agey, but this is way more new-agey than I expected. There are very few practical tips. Nothing incredible in this book. I haven't learned anything new. This is one I'll either be de-cluttering soon or giving away."
5,Nice mop pads,I purchased these to use with my Steamfast mop. They are machine washable and fit fine even after being thrown in the dryer. Perhaps the Steamfast head is slightly smaller than the Bissell...I don't know about that but they fit well on it. They are sturdy and well made.
2,not all that easy...,"I think these pads are actually a real pain to put on. I like the mop in theory, but I find myself avoiding cleaning the floor because getting the pad on the thing is such a frustration."
1,Poor fit - Poor selection of material,"Knock off brand does not produce a secure fit on the steamer head...will slide off.Also, the microfiber like material used for the mop head does not ""slide"" on the tile, and in fact grips the floor, making it next to impossible to manuver the steamer to perform the function it was made to do!Will purchase original cotton type mop head next time!"
3,Could have had a longer drawstring!,"The steam mop is absolutely wonderful and good for your health because it cleans with steam. The mop pads are good until you wash them, Letting them air dry is the only way to get them back on, but the fit isn't good because you can pull the drawstring without using your teeth or a screwdriver to tighten it. This product would have worked better with a longer cord."
1,Not what it appears,"I tried to reorder the original pads for this steam mop--the ones they show in the photo. Instead I got these green replacement pads that have ridges in them and streak the floor. Of course, returning them would cost more in shipping than it's worth so I'm stuck with false advertising. If anyone knows where I can find the true ""original"" white replacements, please let me know!"
2,work well but not durable,"These pads worked well for removing dirt, but they got holes in them rather quickly."
1,"Ok, to use as a replacement, Orginals better!",I found the material of this product not the same as the original green ones that come with bissel steam mop. They are not as soft and is more difficult to use on tile floor. Good to use as a backup.
1,is this a knock-off?,I should have known. Other Bissell replacement mop heads are 2 for $19.99. This one was 2 for $9.99 so I thought I had stumbled on a good deal. It did ship promptly. The first time I used the new pad it got holes - YIKES! that's five dollars to wash the kitchen floor- waaay too exspensive. The question is: are these pads some kind of cheap knock-off? They look exactly like the pads that came with the Steam Mop as well as other replacement pads I've bought (but not from this vendor). My opinion is - don't buy these cheap pads the $19.99 ones last a lot longer.
5,Great job,The Bissell steam mop does a great job. The hot steam removes tough stains on floors. I would highly recommend it.
4,WOULD RECOMMEND!!!!!,"I purchased this product along with the Bissell - by recommendation. And am very pleased I did...I have wood floors and the clean them great. Only thing pads get very dirty, but I wash them and reuse...Steam cleaner comes with two - I purchased more. Would recommend."
3,Steam distress,"Only back up solution available for steam mop. Original pads were lost and these work on any size steam mop Not a perfect fit, but easy to clean and worked 90% of the time."
3,Bissell Steam Mop Pads,"Shipping was extremely fast, but a bit much for how small/light the package was. I would still recommend this seller. Thanks!"
3,Not as good as the original,"I've been using the original green pads and the steam mop works great. I just bought these replacement pads so I can do the whole house in one day, if I wanted and they just aren't as good as the original ones that come with the Steam Mop. They don't fit as well (even wet), they tend to push dirt around instead of cleaning it, and I have to pass over a spot many more times than with the original pads. I still have the original pads and they work awesome. These replacement pads are still way better than getting on the floor and scrubbing by hand, so I gave them 3 stars, but Bissell should offer the great product they originally include."
3,clarification,The original green mop pads are available under model number 3255 and are microfiber. These are cheaper but not the same as the original.
2,DO NOT DRY THEM,"The mop is a great product, but once you dry the pads they shrink beyond the point of wanting to ever use the mop again. I avoid mopping the floor at all costs because it is such a hassle to get them on now. I am either going to have to buy new ones or use something else to clean the floors."
4,Great replacement pads,Pads work great! I was glad I read previous reviews so that I did not put them in the dryer. I love this mop!
1,Do NOT Dry these pads after washing....,"I LOVE the steam mop, but the replacement pads shrink in the dryer, making it next to impossible, and downright frustrating to get them to fit back on the steam mop properly. Bissell needs to redesign these to have elastic or something on them so that they go over the mop and attach easily. It takes longer to fight with the pads to get them back on the mop than it does to clean my entire kichen floor!"
1,wrong item received,I ordered the new white version of the pads but received the older green version which were no good. Apparently they were both under the same # . When I wrote and asked for the correct ones they told me they were no longer available. Why they still show them on the website is a mystery!
3,Mop Pads,"The degign is difficult. They won't stay on the steam mop because they don't come up high enough around the mop head. The barrel slide fastener does not tighten enough to hold them on. If it wasn't for the fact the Bissell 3250 works so good itself and I am happy with that, I would not fight so hard to keep the pad on the head."
2,Bissell Steam Mop,"We purchased this steam mop and also purchased a Shark Steam Mop for a gift. Unfortunately we kept the Bissell. The Bissell leaves a lot of water on the floor and has to be cleaned up after use. On the other side, the Shark leaves the floor almost dry and does not have to be mopped up to remove excess water. We are not happy with the Bissell."
3,retile info,This book is small. It has 2 pages of stickers. The other pages have a paragraph describing the animal and at the top there is a space for the sticker of that animal. Very small but it was only $1.50 so its pretty good
4,"Thoughtful, in-depth examination of complex research method","Kvale has done a great service for qualitative researchers the world over. Too often we take the interview process (from conceptualization through analysis) for granted. Kvale has clearly presented an indepth analysis of the the theoretical and philosophical foundations of interviewing and the influence those foundations have on the process, the content, and the analysis of qualitative interviews. This is essential reading for any qualitative researcher and should be on the required reading lists for any course in this area."
5,"One of the best extension poles, if not the best in the market.",I have been painting for roughly 8 years (3 years at the union level and the rest as a business owner whenever I want to prove a point and get my hands dirty). I have the 2-4ft Wooster GT and the 4-8 WGT (for ceilings) and I must say that they got it right with this extension pole (especially when paired with a wooster sherlock handle. the extension portion of the stick is really sturdy until it is extended up to the last possible hole. Even at the last hole it is much sturdier than most of the other extension poles I have used.
3,Love this group but not my favorite,"Quality music overall but not as good as Neopolitan Cafe, my favorite from this group. Dunno if they are still recording but I'd like to hear more."
4,kids loved it,My nephew and niece watched the show without bothering me once while on our road trip. They really enjoyed the enthusiasm of the actors. I only wish there were more destinations included in the DVD.Great concept.
4,Corgi Fun at the Palace,"A jolly account of the adventures of one of the Queen's Corgi puppies. Amusing drawings, and a view of the royals from a Corgi's point of view. Should be enjoyed by readers from 8 to 80."
4,Loved the concept but.....,"I bought this book for my 8 year old. We have a corgi and I thought she would love the idea of the Queen's corgi's. She did, but I was uncomfortable with the drinking and smoking in the book. It didn't need to be in there. The rest of the book was enjoyable. Buy it if you feel comfortable with smoking and drinking ""romantized""."
2,My complant,"I am not paying that much for a video game, because why ? because its a old game,some people do not play its kind of games,because kids today play newer games like halo or god of war,and that's why you should lower the price."
3,Bubsy-sequel's better,"Buy Bubsy II, I had that first and it is way more fun than the first one. I was highly disappointed."
2,Disappointment,"I bought this book after hearing the author give a radio interview. Much to my surprise, the book bore little resemblance to the interview topics; the title is misleading, as well. It is a story of prayer that occurred in the author's church over 20 years ago. There are lots of published accounts on God answering prayer, and nothing sets this one apart from the pack. It didn't tell me anything I didn't already know, and really was not all that good a read."
1,The Worst Movie Ever Made!,I like Billy Crystal and Joan Rivers but seriously what were they thinking? This has got to be the worst movie ever Made!
5,Wow!,"""TEMPTATION is the long awaited second volume of Jeff's male nude images. It is an exceptional book that features 65 duotone pages of masculine and powerful imagery -- dramatic ... romantic ... erotic ... honest ... beautiful. This handsome hardbound 8 x 9 monograph is the perfect addition to every collection and makes a beautiful gift. This book continues what Jeff is known for -- classic images of men alone and men with men. It also introduces more erotic images that Jeff has been working with in the past few years."" - description from jeffpalmer.com"
2,Only makes a difference outdoors,"Most of the noise coming from the vaccuum comes straight out the top. If you're inside, the muffler (which attaches to the exhaust) does nothing because the exhaust noise is nothing compared to the motor noise. Outside, the motor noise goes straight up and away and the exhaust noise is more of a factor.If you use your vac outside a lot and have fussy neighbors, get it. If not, save your money."
4,Works Well,I got this for the sears 6 hp shop vac with detachable blower. This muffler substanstially reduced the noise especially the high piched squell. just watch where you point it because the air blows very strongly out of it.
4,True Story Well Documented,"Once again, Jerry Borrowman uses his excellent research skills with his writing talent to produce an engaging, but true book. Worth the read to see how LDS youth stood up to the Nazis."
2,greatest hits?,"Is it just me or are all the ""Greatest Hits"" CD's that Master P put out recently represent most of the garbage that led to No Limit fallin of the map. I own alot of the older No Limit CD's from Ghetto D to as late as the 504 Boyz, and alot of the classic songs they released are nowhere to be found on any of the greatest radio garbage cd's. P needs to release some of the other rappers older cd's that were on the label when they were at there best, swallow your pride bitch and pay the people who made you rich!"
3,Not at all greatest hits.,"This cd is really weak.silkk talks most of the time.The only good tracks are Im a soldier,It aint my fault part 1 and 2, he did that, and let me hit it."
2,dries skin,"I didn't buy it from amazon, i got a small bar for a dollar at my local asian supermarket. I tried it out by washing my hands and it left my skin feeling very dry! I do not have sensitive skin. I'm disappointed :("
5,Hauting Folk Songs,"Mr Fox had a more stripped back style than Steeleye and Fairport - it is folk music after all. Aunt Lucy Broadwood is a very old traditional song - my great aunt recognised it from her childhood and she was born in the 1878! The Gypsy is a great narrative song IMHO. ""I'd like to tell you people that I met her at a fayre - but I met her in a pub down by the far side of the square. She was dark and she was handsome and her name was Mary Lee and I'll tell you of the good times of Mary Lee and me.....""I saw Bob Pegg perform many of these songs with Nick Strutt in a pub in Nottingham. Nick played guitar and Bob sang and played penny whistle. Much of the performance was voice only and I was most impressed.I agree with icb - their songs can lead to an emotional experience. Mr Fox may not have hit the big time and can thus be described as ""second-string"" - but they are emphatically not secong rate! Their eponymous album Mr Fox and the double compilation CD are now available in the UK."
3,"Some Wheat, But a Good Amount of Chaff","Mr. Fox was a second-string British folk rock band that followed in the wake of Fairport Convention and The Pentangle, but never achieved the renown of those groups. There's a reason: Mr. Fox was simply not in their league, instrumentally or compositionally. This reissue of the two Mr. Fox LPs has some good songs (""Rip Van Winkle"" and ""Dancing Song""), but also some mediocre ones (""Elvira Madigan"" is earnest singer-songwriter sap) and even some poor ones (""Aunt Lucy Broadwood"" is painful to listen to). Bob Pegg's original compositions dominated the band's repertoire, but Bob's no Richard Thompson. Actually, it was his former wife, fiddler Carolanne Pegg. After the demise of Mr. Fox and the Peggs' marriage, Carolanne released a killer solo album, self-titled, that far surpassed any of the Mr. Fox music. Her record, which has been reissued on CD, is one of the great lost treasures of the rich British folk-rock movement of the late 60s - early 70s."
4,So much for artistic integrity...,"Damn them! In order to fit 2 albums onto one CD, they left off my favorite song, GRENDL! Unbelievable!"
4,Taekwondo Poomse,This DVD is a basic stright forward step by step video. Shows all the forms on Taekwondo and slows it down to show the movements and the selfdefence of the technique.
3,Comes up short: Rehash of much in the manual,"I looked this book over trying to find out:1)How to apply paymentint with and deal with a non-intuit merchant account (to take credit cards).No help2) I tried to learn more about customer:jobs and how to apply a single payment from a customer across more than one job.No help.This book handles all the things that one can readily get from the manual that comes with quickbooks, but in a more hand-holding way. That's nice, but I'd like a bit more. The items above should be pretty common problems but they are ignored in this text.If you are doing more than simple intro things, this book comes up short."
2,I expect more from Intuit,This book lacks the detail that I expect for a companion book to the manuals. It is best described as an alternative to the bundled manuals but in no way superior.
1,No better than the User's Guide,"There are a few tips and shortcuts in the book that are handy but don't look to it to help you figure out how to use Quickbooks to customize your business. There are few examples of how the various features can actually be used and, most dismaying of all, no analysis of how the things you're instructed to do actually affect your accounts."
2,Clarity in Document Design,"This book rates with the likes of Adobe's manuals which are famous for talking about features but not giving you ""How to"" instructions. (At least it doesn't keep referring you to another page!)Typical of this level of instruction writing are statements such as-""Use the Write Checks window"". There is no such window normally visable. You have to go to - Banking -then choose Cheques. This is a minor example but you get the idea. The book is not ""Task Orientated"". Yes, there are some step by step instructions, but most of the instructions are in paragraph form and presume you know how to reach the ""Write Checks window"".It has a great deal of information and could be useful if you are an intuitive person when it comes to computer programs."
4,A Score By Clapton,"Eric Clapton had never provided the score to a film, but he finally jumped into the film area with the soundtrack to Rush. The movie chronicles the tale of two undercover narcotic offices who in the course of their jobs become heroin addicts themselves. The album is made up of mostly instrumentals that has a dark and mellow nature that underscores the decent into drug addicted hell the two cops spiral into. Mr. Clapton himself was facing tragedy as he was recording the album, his four year old son Conner, was killed when he accidentally fell out of a window. To memorialize his son, he wrote and recorded one of most haunting and elegant songs ever written about the loss of loved one, ""Tears In Heaven"". The song would go on to bigger fame in it's Unplugged version, but the studio version is equally beautiful and worth buying the album for alone."
3,Some good tracks.....,"Generally, the CD is very mellow and relaxing. 7 of the tracks are instrumental pieces, and 3 have vocals. Clapton's guitar is articulate and sounds great. The digital recording and mastering are very good and the CD has great sound. Like alot of soundtracks, the pieces tend to wander without the accompanying video, but this one isn't too bad. It is great music to doze in and out of during an afternoon rain! Some of the better tracks are in the sample listening:1. New Recruit4. Kristen and Jim5. Preludin Fugue (the sample omits the best part)Enjoy!"
2,Rush,"I was very disappointed with this cd. The movie was so good and had alot of good songs.The music in the movie was not on the cd. It only has the guitar solos and two songs with words. If I had known this ,I would of bought singles instead of the cd."
3,Get outta my dreams,"Probably only for die-hard Clapton fans, or people who really like the movie. When I listen, I start to imagine I'm taking drugs with Jennifer Jason Leigh, ruining my future as a police officer, and I become depressed."
3,Muddled Ending,I caught this movie years and years ago on late night TV. It's a foreign film and of course the dubbing is terrible and there were some obvious cuts made to show it on television but it has a really cool fog-bound atmosphere and at least one scene that will startle you. It's a fun movie to watch late at night if you catch it in the right mood (or you've had enough beer.) The main problem with this is the crazy way that it ends. I garantee you will be sitting there after it's over scratching your head trying to make sense of it. I still enjoyed watching it even with that whacked out ending that comes out of nowhere.
4,Excellent,I bought the product for my mom who is having some problems with her knees. She has not complained since using it. I would assume that she is pleased.
4,works well,I purchased this product because of a shoulder injury. It seemed to take the pain and achiness away. I would recommend this product.
1,Of no value !,This product has absolutely no value as a pain reliever or for any other purpose as far as I can see .
2,"Good General use, bad metal.","PROS:This is a good general-use knife and is sharp enough to chop most vegetables and meats... It also has a pretty good and comfy handle.Easy to resharpen and remove dings on a whet stone due to soft metal.CONS:Very flimsy and soft metal is used in the knife's construction. I have seen this knife's blade dent because of cutting a simple thing such as a prailine (which a standard Whustof or Henkels would not do for not much more money).OVERALL:This is absolutely an ameture housewife knife. NOT good for industrial work at all. It is, though, a decent ""back-up"" knife if there is something to hack-up that you dont want your more expsneive knives (assuming the reader works in an industrial kitchen) to touch or possibly get damaged.My advice, pay an extra 20 bucks and buy a low-mid range Whustof or Henkels... something that is not stamped steel and has a full tang.I hope this helps."
1,Hard to say,"Would like to write this review, but never received this item..... some %^#@!^& along the way decided to write order refused and I never got it..."
2,You pay for his advertising.,"This reminds me a lot of the Corel Jeremy Sutton DVD. Both cost $50.00 or more but only have about an hour's worth of real content. In both cases you are not just paying for instruction but for ""bonus"" advertising by the artists. In both cases if you just stick to the manual or instructions on the DVD, though it would take longer than a visual/audiodemo (that is the one I hoped for but did not get), you find the same info but far, far more of it.Maybe it was just my particular copy of Church's DVD, but another problem was that about 10% of the far left and 10-20% of the bottom sections of the DVD were not visible!! For example it showed a man talking at the bottom of the screen and his mouth could not be seen."
3,Not a great book but okay for beginners.,If I had picked up the book in a bookstore I wouldn't have bought it.
1,A big pain the you know what,"If you are thinking about ordering one of these dvd's please let me warn of the following:1.We paid for in October 2008 and it took us being lied to by Pixfusion (the makers of the DVD) several times about shipping dates plus numerous phone calls before we finnaly got the DVD, just days before Christmas.2. It is now March 5 2009 and we still haven't recieved the picture we sent in to make the video back yet. Again more phone calls,more lying about shipping dates. And now, today, they tell me they ""just have too many to ship and they are TAKING A BREAK FROM SENDING BACK PICS until April 1st!!!!!!That means that in total (so far) we have been messing with this one item for Six Months!The product itself is good enough but there is now way I would have ever bought one if I had known what a hassel we were in for."
2,not pleased,I ordered a bathing suit size 12 months and what I recieved was a bathing suit for a 30 pound child. 12-month sizes typically run 18 lbs to 22 lbs. The size chart is deceiving I am unable to use this item.
3,patient,It's a good swimsuit but you have to be patient tying the back of the bathingsuit because it comes undone every few seconds. And the front of the bathingsuit looks uncomfortable and doesn't cover that well.
5,El Principe en todo su apogeo!!,"This group of love songs is sung by the utmost artist in this music genre,which together with the orchestra behind him, ; it was a production for the ages."
1,horrible dont buy,THIS IS THE WORST TOY EVER YOU CANT EVEN PUT YOUR HAND THROUGH IT ITS WAY TO HARD .IF YOUR LOOKING TO GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS DONT BUY THIS ONE I WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST GETTING A PLASTIC ONE!!!
4,Fun,"Fun toy. My 11-year old son loves it. It's loud though, when you turn it upside down and he likes to drive his little sister crazy by doing that. Sort-of like the game Boggle.... great game, but loud when you shake it."
2,"Very poorly made, arrived broken","I always do my homework by reading the amazon reviews for items I plan to buy. I read about the poor construction of this toy, but given a lack of other choices, I decided to take my chances anyway and hope for the best. Sure enough, 2 of the 6 pins holding this toy together were broken upon arrival. Instead of going through the return hassle, I just moved the 4 good pins to the corners for now to keep it secure, and I'll look for my own hardware to fix it myself. There was no box damage at all; this toy just isn't very durable. If you decide to buy anyway, I hope you are luckier than I was!-Tony"
2,Great concept but poorly made,Our daughter very much likes this type of toy. However the one from Toysmith that we bought did not even survive shipping though the package was not damaged in transit. Amazon provided good customer service and refunded the cost but we were still dissapointed and now looking for a better supplier.
2,Dont get this one,"This toy was broken on arival one of the screws was broken off, the glass or plastic plate in front of it was dirty and some of the nails were kinda bent. But it still works and was not all that fun about five minute of play into it got old i am very mad about this product dont be cheap get the $20 ones"
3,"cool toy, not strong enough","I had one of these when I was a kid and remember liking it. I bought one for my 5 year nephew. He loved it ... for about 20 minutes. Then he dropped it and the corner broke. It is still usable but is missing the corner and one of the screws. If you are going to buy it, maybe buy it for an older child."
1,Poor Quality,"When this arrived neither the outer package nor the inner package appeared to be damaged in any way. Yet when I opened the inner package, I could see that it was totally broken. The black posts that are supposed to connect the clear plate and black plate and keep the pins in place all had the heads snapped off. The pins were falling out everywhere. This product is definitely made of inferior plastic material. I am just returning it for a refund and not having a new one sent from this vendor. I wasn't at all surprised to see that this junk was ""Made in China"" ...I wish Amazon would specify the origin of its products, so I could buy American made products and bypass this kind of junk altogether!"
1,Shoddy Craftsmanship,"The product arrived damaged. The construction is cheap plastic - the screws holding the case together weren't aligned properly, and one was already broken. Several of the pins are bent - do not buy this item from this manufacturer."
1,broke on the second day,This toy broke the first time my 4 year old dropped it on the floor. Pins everywhere. I was still finding them two days later. It was fun while it lasted (two days)but it's not for children because sooner or later they will drop it and that's the end of it.
2,Fun toy but be careful,"The recommended age starts at 5 but it just seems like an accident waiting to happen.The pins are sharp, I actually cut my finger when I picked it up to give to my husband who went to go show my daughter how it works and several of the pins ended up getting stuck and it took several minutes to get it fixed.I remember these things as a kid but I don't remember the pins being that sharp! As a kid, I would put my face in it to get the impression on the other side but I wouldn't dare do it with this one! So besides the sharp pins and the questionable quality... They are a fun toy to mess around with. Buy with caution!UPDATE:I just took away a star- we have barely even played with it and the pins are constantly getting stuck. Not impressed with the quality."
3,Pins are hard to move,I got this as a stocking stuffer gift and the pins are hard to move. It's okay but I wouldn't recommend.
1,Very Poor Quality Broke Within Minutes,"Bought this for my five year old boy for Christmas. He loved it but accidentally dropped it on the carpet within minutes of opening. It disintegrated and metal pins were everywhere, which my other four yo son decided would be fun to pick up and throw. Complete disaster. My 5 yo was very sad. Great idea, but significant design flaw in product in that the clear acrylic front is connected to the body by cheap plastic pins. These break without much effort at all. Once broken there is nothing to hold the metal pins in. They go everywhere. Makes you wonder what they possibly could have been thinking when they made this.Summary: looks great on the website and kids love this product, so seems like a great idea to buy it, but do not buy this one. Cheap piece of junk. You will be disappointed."
4,Smaller than I thought,It was smaller than I thought for being called Large Pin Art Toy. But everyone at the party loved it - the birthday boy hardly got to play with it till later. We've had people of all ages fascinated with this toy.
2,Very Poor Design,"My older daughter, having seen this toy at her cousin's house, seemed to be interested in this toy, so I ordered this one through Amazon. Very disappointed to find that two of the bolts which hold the front and back halves together were broken. They are made of plastic which is clearly insufficient to the task. I decided to replace all six bolts with metal ones purchased at local home store and toy is now enjoyable, but what a disappointment to have it broken upon arrival. Several other reviewers have had same experience. Unless you wish to repair upon arrival, look elsewhere for a pin art toy."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!,the first time i saw something like this was at my grandmas house my son played with it the whole time he was there. i recommend this to all ages
3,"addictive, but could be better quality","We enjoy playing with this toy - hard to put down and just fun to handle. It tends to fall over if you are trying to save a shape vertically. The plastic frame is not as sturdy as I would have liked. Still, can't put it down and neither can the kids."
2,unhappy,"I use to love this toy when I was a kid. I have had to order this product twice, due to poor shipping handling/packaging. Both times this product showed up in pieces. The plexiglass fell off causing the needles to fall out of the case."
4,Great durable sensory toy for children with autism,"I got this toy for my 10 year old son with autism. He loved the plastic version but it wasn't durable enough to handle rough play. This one handles everything. He has dropped it several times, tried to remove the pins, and stood on it (he weighs about 85lbs). Still intact. My other son and daughter spend a lot of time playing with it as well, which suprised me. I wouldn't recommend this toy for households with toddlers as the toy is heavy and the edges are a little rough. They won't cut skin, but they feel like coarse sand paper. Keep that in mind, too, if your child has texture issues."
3,"Fun, But not what remember",it looks cool but i didn't remember the pins being so close together and sharp.
1,PIECE OF JUNK!,"THE PINS IN THIS WERE ALL CROOKED, SO IT DIDN'T EVEN WORK. IT IS GOING BACK! VERY DISAPPOINTED IN IT."
1,Hunk of junk,This is the biggest piece of crap ever. My poor daughter excitedly opened the box today only to have hundreds of pins fall out. The whole thing was broken! Packaging showed no signs of damage. Typical made in China piece of junk.
1,Can Cause Injury,"My husband was trying to show the kids his funny face when pressed against the pins and he received a scratch across his eyelid. That's when we noticed upon closer inspection that the back of each pin is rough and jagged. They are not smooth and rounded like the ones we had when we were kids. I don't know if we just got a bad one itself or if they are all like this, but I would not recommend this to anyone based on our experience. We are still looking for a higher quality one that is safe to use, but this one is not safe. The back pins really feel like you're resting your skin against a lot of sharp pointed nails and they look like it too. If you decide to buy this anyway, be sure to check the pins before letting any children play with this so they can't be hurt. If I still had the box and receipt, I'd have returned it. Lesson learned!"
1,cheepest piece of crap!!!,"Its been awhile since i have gotten an item built this cheep!! Might as well get a napkin and some toothpics. The pins hardly slide threw or reset, the pins are sharp. After a couple times picking it up three of the studs holding it together broke off! this is not a lemon its a very poor product line! DO NOT BUY!"
1,A piece of junk,We made a mistake by not reading the reviews of this item before purchasing.It arrives broken. When you pull the package out the nails pins will fall out. It is not assembled!Very poorly made. It is junk.
2,low quality,"I was disappointed with how poorly constructed this Toysmith product was. Bought two as gifts and found pins bent, and broken bolts. I will be looking for a higher quality build in an alternate from another manufacturer.Update: I didn't find another better built version; I had to build it stronger myself, replacing the original cheap, plastic bolts and cap nuts with metal ones from my local hardware store. The pins that were bent were finessed back to a working shape, and it turns out what seemed like missing pins at first glance were just pins stuck out of sight because of they were bent, so after a little tinkering the toy is good to go."
3,would not recommend this for young children,"I bought this for my grankids ages 5 and 7. The pins are sharp and cause scratches. They have an older one that pins are blunt, and they can actually put on their face without injury. The description says it's for children 5 and up. I would not recommend this for young children. On the plus side, it keeps them them very entertained."
2,Not durable,"Within a few weeks, one of the screws that holds it together fell out. Now it doesn't hold together properly."
1,Poor,I ordered this for my austic classroom for the kids to use for sensory. The item is not worth purchasing.It arrived open & broken.
2,Might want to consider plastic pin versions - not good for children,This product uses metal pins and several of the pins on mine were a little bent so did not always pop back quickly. I could easily straignten though. Also the ends of the pins seem to have been cut with a wire cutter and not rounded. Therefore when you push against your hand or other body part the sharp edges can hurt. Also the pins will not push very far in as they seem to get stuck due to hitting each other. Build quality is poor on this product.As the pins are metal product is quite heavy and will not balance on its side or end when many of the pins extended so if you want to leave a display of a pressing you need to be sure a lot of pins pushed in.If you want a metal version I would suggest looking for one with rounded pin ends and better build quality of look at one with plastic pins
4,Ageless gadget toy,"While I bought this for my granddaughter, my husband and I love playing with this, too. It's fascinating to see all the outlines you can make. Some of them are so comical as to leave us laughing out loud. Great toy for all ages."
4,Good but ...,"This pin box looks good, it could be better quality and material construction, but at that price i think its worth the money, you get what you pay for"
5,"Great mystery, great book","This is a wonderful book, one of those cross-over books that could almost be a YA book. The hero is autistic, pretty high functioning most of the time, but he's found at the start of the book standing over the a dead dog. The Curious Incident is part thriller, part psychological novel, a comedy and a tragedy all in one. I found myself reading it breathlessly. There are scenes-- like the one in the London Underground, that are absolutely unforgettable. The story of one man's journey to discover the truth-- thereby uncovering far more than he ever expected-- makes this a genuine masterpiece. Highly recommended for general readers, really smart teenagers, and book club everywhere."
5,Powerful easy read,It's rare to find a book like this that is a pleasant easy read while still packing enough power to really move a reader. The fact that there have been 1600+ reviews already written really speaks to the popularity of this book and that popularity is well deserved. The author has managed to write this book in such a way that you can actually picture yourself seeing through an autistic child's eyes. It is incredibly interesting to learn the thought processes behind the behaviors you may have noticed from autistic people in passing.The book is filled with clever little bits here and there to really tie everything together and the overall plot flows well throughout the book with enough action to make you want to keep moving through the uniquely numbered chapters. This is a must read and I know I'll be recommending it to all of my friends and family.
3,"Interesting read, but leaves you without much closure","Written in the perspective of a child with autism, the perspective, writing style, and how the story unfolds is interesting and the reason I picked up the book. Why I didn't give it more than 3 stars is because I felt the story was one disapointment after another that never really led to much of a climax or closure, nor any one momentous event (negative or positive) to serve as some type of finale. Some won't mind that and maybe it is intentional of the author to show his view of living with a child with a learning disability, but it left me personally feeling like the story was imcomplete, so as a novel, 3 stars."
4,Great,Was a good read. Very accurate look into the mind of a mentally challenged child. You'll be sure to read it a couple times to understand how this kid's mind works.
5,Wonderful book,"this novel is eye-opening. we tend to view others from our own perspective, but Mr Haddon has been able to show us that there may be many times whem our perception is completely off. motives that we assign to the actions of others because they would have been our motives could be entirely false. we must realize that individuals are unique and we should give our fellow humans the benefit of the doubt"
4,Enlightening,Ever wonder what its like to see the world through the eyes of an autistic teenager? Neither have I but incidentally this book sparks your curiosity and keeps you hooked with its creative writing style and story. Definatly a good read.
4,Thumbs up,"This was a fun (unusual, but fun,) fast read, at least in my opinion. The story zips along quickly and the main character's unusual point of view kept things fresh and interesting for me.One thing I will say - I thought that Christopher's viewpoint was quite interesting, and a nice interpretation of what MIGHT go on in the mind of an autistic teen. I've heard a lot about this book being a window into the autistic mind, though, when in the end it is still a fictional account. If what you're looking for is insight into the autistic mind then I would recommend reading something by Temple Grandin, Tito Mukhopadhyay, Sean Barron, or Donna Williams, who are autistic themselves and can give a more definite opinion about their own inner lives. If you're looking for a great read, though, I would recommend this book!"
5,Another philosophical gem,"This novel is, in my opinion, a philosophical gem. Through Christopher's orderly (autistic) view of the world and his surroundings we are introduced to the disorder and emotional instability of those around him -- the ""non""autistic ones, -- his parents, the Shears and the characters on his journey through this compelling tale.I found the subtle storytelling to be remarkable. I am truly grateful to have read this story.I also recommend Life of Pi."
4,"A quick, pleasing diversion","Curious Incident is a nice book, a quick and frothy read that I thoroughly enjoyed. My mind boggles a bit at the adulation heaped upon it, a sort of uncritical fervor last seen hyping the much less worthy Da Vinci Code.Breezily written, this book borrows some writing tricks from more substantial work. Notably, of course, is the use of a first person narrator who is ""impaired"" (in this case by autism) in a manner similar to, say, Flowers for Algernon. The use of unusual chapter numbering (prime numbers in this case), statistics problems, diagrams, and so forth is amusing in a observational kind of way. These are all tricks, though, that make you sit back a bit from the book. Oooh! Isn't that clever?In any case, the back half of the book seemed to telegraph much of the plot and I surely hope we don't get a sequel. But it is so amusing and a nice diversion from much of the drivel available today that I recommend this novel as a good, enjoyable read."
2,My problem,"Possibly, my expectations were too high. Lots of friends recommended the book in enthusiastic terms: I quite liked it, it's nice, it's pleasant, it's really interesting but I hoped for more. It certainly is a very curious booklet (pun intended)"
5,Wonderful.,"I loved this story, it was very insightful and a great aid to understanding someone with a disability. That aside, the story itself was intense and I was genuinely worried about the outcome. It made me laugh, get teary and reflect on my own life and social interactions. Overall I highly recommend it for anyone to read."
4,Too short,"Having some experience with mentally challenged (30 yhears), I found this book to be very realistic. It was like being in the mind of that young man and felt like a completely honest portrayal. I enjoyed it very much. Wish it was longer."
3,Enjoyable to a point,"I did enjoy this book, but there were times that a felt urged just to skip a paragraph or two. I guess this book would be good to read small bits over time not all at once. At least for me, it got a little over whelming reading so many pages about math or the likes, but once I chopped up my reading of the book I enjoyed it quite a bit more."
5,Shopping?,"If you're shopping around on Amazon for something to fill out your basket, one word of advice: BUY THIS BOOK! I guarantee you find it interesting and above all, the most unusual book you've come across in years. Told from the perspective of an autistic boy, this one will take you into a world you've never known. Highly recommended along with THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES and THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD (another book told from an interesting perspective.)"
3,I Just Didn't Love It,"but i liked it... For me it was a quick read that was 'mildly' interesting and at times equally 'mildly' amusing - but, just left me a little uninterested in the characters. Concept is good - different. But I needed more of something or other. Basically, I put the book down after the last page was turned and was 'mildly' relieved."
4,Curious preaching from an otherwise interesting read,"I enjoyed reading this novel. I found it engaging right from the start. It was interesting to see things from a different perspective. I got some insight, I think, into a very different way of looking at life. Christopher would, indeed, be a handful.My problem with this book and why I would not give it a rave review is the atheism kind of tacked-on here and there. It feels false to the character. It feels like the authour saw an opportunity to preach his view of religion and was not faithful to the character in so doing. I found that disappointing and distracting. It is not integral to the story, though, so it's easy to overlook."
3,It's alright...,"I don't know what all the fuss is about. The book has a good premise and on the surface appears to be interesting, but once you've been hooked in, you don't get the story that was described on the back of the book. I liked reading about Christopher's personality and his quirks, and I liked hearing about his investigation, but other than that, it bored me to tears and I found myself skimming through much of the book. If you want to learn about mathematics and other scientific information, this book would be great for you. Otherwise, save your money. I had to put the book down mid-way through so I could devote my time to a good book. I think this is just getting a good wrap because people are jumping on the bandwagon and thinking it's some great intellectual insight into an autistic child, and while I can see where that's coming from, it was a boring read."
3,A Curious Story,"This book starts out as a murder mystery novel through the eyes of a sixteen-year-old autistic boy named Christopher. Extremely smart when it comes to Math and Science, but lacking in understanding of other people and common sense. The plot is interwoven with puzzles and diagrams that help explain his complex way of thinking.Christopher masters his everyday routine and has his days planned out to the minute, but when he finds himself in an unusual situation, he must use all of his brainpower and bravery to get through what to us seems like just an average rain ride. Fearful of strangers, disliking yellow and brown, and betrayed by his own father, Christopher gives the readers a greater understanding of the autistic mind, and is guaranteed to stay in the hearts and minds of all who read his story."
5,AMAZING!!,"I find it difficult to come up with a more original word than ""Amazing"" for this book, but it truly is an exceptional tale. There is no need to describe the plot in this review because it is handled well enough by others, but I do want to say that this is a very unique reading experience--an unforgetable look into the mind and perspective of someone whose brain processes day-to-day information in a way that is very different from the majority of people in the world. The character's approach to problem solving was absolutely fascinating!! This book is definitely in my top-ten alltime favorite category; if I could give it SIX STARS I would!! Don't miss this experience!!"
4,Something Completely Different,Engaging look thru an autistic's eyes. An education in a mystery.A unique experience.
5,An engrossing listen (Audio version review).,"I was thankful for the traffic this morning, lengthening my already long drive so that I could enjoy a few more chapters.I'd recommend this to anyone who is not bound to a rigid story line, and truly think this is a better book to listen to, than to read. I would be tempted to skip bits if I were reading it - something that's impossible in the audio book... and those bits are all part of what makes this book so engrossing. (Where will Christopher's story take us next?)The narrator, too, is a wonderful bonus, gained as a result of the audio edition. He provides the right tone and voices - far better than my own inner voice."
4,"Interesting, yet repetitive.","I found this book to be very intriguing when you are able to detach yourself from your own mind and put yourself into his. But at the same time I do feel that the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time was very repetitive and felt that near the end, the writing styles started to feel like beating a dead horse. But definitely worth the time to read. :)"
3,Need to Read Again,"I need to read this book again. I didn't think it was bad, but just didn't think it was that great and yet everyone raves about it. I saw Dave Barry recommend this book and author on the Today Show and between admiring Dave Barry's writing and also because I have a son with high functioning autims I could't wait to get the book. Maybe I read it too quickly because as I say while I thought it was good I did not think it was great. I am going to give it another chance as I am ""curious"" why everyone thinks it is so fantastic."
4,Thank-you,"I learned so much from this book. A must for teachers. Also the insanity of how adults jump into relationships, is right on."
3,white and black side of the book,"I just say it straight: if you are only interested in crime and mysterious: leave your hands from this book, you might get really bored even if the title seems to be quite interesting to you.But if you are a person who likes to read about people, their behaviours and especially about those who see the world from a different point of view as Christopher does because he has the Asperger's Syndrom: grab it!You will probably find many interesting aspects while Christopher is on his search for a dog's murderer because the book has some special features which help to understand Christopher's point of view."
2,I tried SO HARD to like this book ...,"Alas, while fascinating to understand the perspective of a child with special needs, it's just not entertaining. Read this to be edified, and to be grateful to be who you are and capable of all you can do ... but do not read this book for entertainment."
5,Worth Reading,"While the book was at times teetered on the edge of dull by the great detail that the main character discusses issues that are off topic and not related to the plot, it offers insight into how he thinks, offering character development for the plight of this autistic young man.All in all, I found this quick read very well written and thoroughly entertaining."
4,A Very Different Read But Interesting,"At first, I had a difficult time ""getting into"" this book and I'm an avid reader. But, as I continued reading and became accustomed to the writing style (that of an adolescent with a form of Autism), it drew me in.I think I REALLY got ""hooked"" from the middle to the end of the book.A little slow at first but, in my opinion, if you just ""hang in there"", it DOES get quite interesting and exciting!"
3,A good idea but not realistic,"The idea of using an autistic child as the protagonist was a masterful one. However, the reality of autism would be hard to weave into effective narration and so the characteristics of the boy are not realistic. The incident was engaging but not effectively constructed. I had heard a lot about this book and was disappointed"
5,A Fun Read!,"I read this book years ago, and I have purchased many copies since then as gifts for others. I am an avid reader, but I have never read a book that was narrated in such a fresh and creative way. I give this book five stars, but I cannot say the same for Haddon's other books... in fact, I don't think I would even give ""A Spot of Bother"" ONE star. That's okay though, because I am glad that Haddon was able to capture my interest with ""the curious incident""!"
5,"A wonderfull ,accurate account of an autistic boys life.","Meet chris. He has a photograpic memory. He can understand maths, he can understand science, but what eh can't understand is other human beings.In this surprisingly real story, Chris ends up finding out things that he would much rather wish he had'nt.Mark Haddon has writen 15 books for teenagers, and i think that this is his best book to date. It has an amazing plot line and fantastic charecters. With this book your bound to get drawn in by everything about it.Rating, 5 stars, bring on the next book!"
3,A beautiful autistic child's mind,"In the course of the curious incident of the dog in the night-time by Mark Haddon, he explains how autistic child is. Mark Haddon has written a wonderful and great novel about an autistic child. I agree with Mark Haddon by explaining how an autistic child is. By writing the curious incident of the dog in the night-time tells readers how an autistic child acts towards everyone who is around him or her. Mark Haddon writes about an outstanding fiction character and develops an amazing character's mind. Also how Mark uses prime numbers as his chapters. This is something different about the book I like. Aside from the prime numbers, he uses drawings, diagrams, and footnotes which caught my eye to read the book. As well as learning about autism and a child with autism."
4,Unique and enjoyable,"Had difficulty at first following Christopher's way of thinking, but soon caught on. The family seemed real, like people you know. Enjoyed the subtle intrigue of Christopher's ""detective"" work, especially the surprises that come out of it. An interesting novel with an unusual point of view that works surprisingly well. Recommended."
4,Touching and Memorable,"Actually I would give this one 4.5 stars if I could. Haddon's book is original and endearing; it's narrated by an austitic boy whose quest to find out who killed the neighbor's dog leads him to make shocking discoveries about his own family. Parts of this book made me laugh out loud and parts made me want to cry. Christopher helps open the readers eyes to the fact that having a disability doesn't mean leading a less fulfilling life.It's definately worth the read, and it's a quickie too; I finished in one night. I would also recommend this title for high school aged readers and book clubs."
4,Interesting glimpse at a small slice of humanity,"Some folks I've spoken to about this book say it's a good book for teens. In general terms I'd tend to agree except for one thing: this book gives readers a detailed glimpse at a small (but apparently growing) segment of humanity that is not often discussed or widely understood. For that alone it's well worth anyone's time, moreso because it's a quick read."
5,A DOGGONE GREAT INCIDENT,"I couldn't put this book down. It's one of the most memorable books I've ever read. The writing is fantastic. It's incredible how the author ""gets into the head"" of the autistic 15-year old. The scene in the London Underground is so descriptive. It's worth reading the book for that one part alone.But other reasons to read the book are the fun diagrams, mathematical equations, and other schematics which are incorporated into the text. I have recommended this book to a number of my friends. To those who are animal lovers (like myself), I do offer the disclaimer that the story begins with the discovery of the corpse of the neighbor's dog. But I qualify that by stating that it's not all that sad to read about, since we have not been previously introduced to the dog. I am on a personal mission to encourage as many people as possible to read this book. But, I'm not loaning mine out, because I can't wait to read it again."
5,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,Excellent read.It gave me an understanding that any type of disability gives a person the ability to express themselves in their own way and learn in their own terms. Wonderfully written.
4,Different perspective on life,"What I most liked about this book was that it was told from such a unique perspective. The narrator of the story is a teen-aged autistic boy Christopher, who is out to discover who killed his neighbour's dog but in the process uncovers a mystery within his own family.His perspective on life is innocent. Without the filtering systems within his mind to block out unwanted sensory information and filter it to determine what is and is not important, Christopher sees the world literally and takes people at their word. It is a reminder of how silly some of the sayings of everyday life are when you take their meaning by the exact wording."
2,Good concept but not enough substance,"The story starts out very interesting. A 15 year old with some form of autism is trying to figure out who killed his neighbors dog. It is written from the perspective of the child with autism and while this is what makes the book unique, it also becomes somewhat of a tedious book to read. The mystery of the book runs out about 1/2 way through and there just isn't enough of a plot to make up for what occurs after that point. I have a nephew who has some of the same problems and when the main characted is acting out in certain ways I can very much see my nephew in that. The novelty of this point of view wears of quickly for me and that along with about 20% of the book just being random facts mentioned by the main character make this a forgettable book."
4,Insight into Autism,"Christopher's first person account of his story is the best reason for reading this book. If you want to know what goes on in the mind of an autistic teenager, read this book. Mark Haddon is to be commended for his delightful work, and since the book has become so popular, I'm sure the public will understand this developmental problem in a way that doctors and educators will never be able to explain in a better way."
2,Autism is No Excuse,"Wow. What a chore. My wife recommended it so I began reading it. 50 pages in I put it down. The short, choppy senteneces, the long, pointless tangents, and plodding story were too much for me to bear.Next thing I know my brother is recommending the book. His taste is usualy impeccable so I give it another shot. Same problems as before. this time however, I forced myself to finish it hoping against hope something, ANYTHING would make the experience enjoyable. No dice.Using the mentally challenged kid as narrator obviously worked for some - not for me."
2,"personally, i thought this book sucked","i was really hoping to like this book, but unfortunately it did nothing for me. the main character was interesting at first, but ultimately just annoying. i admit, the book is very different and unlike anything i've read up to this point, but umm....that doesn't make it good."
3,Not Bad....,"After getting this book as a Cristmas present, I started it right away. It seemed so exciting, like a mystery book should be. But, sadly, when you are expecting ""red herrings"" and stakeouts and curve balls, this book is disappointing. Also, I felt that the math problems included did not help with the story, and while interesting, was just a waste of trees."
1,The dog was dead ....,"This book is as dead as the dog. It is filled to the brim with random facts that don't progress the story at all, and make you frustrated as you try to see the link. This book has the feeling it was written by a very intelligent 3rd grader. Your reading about a dead dog when suddenly the writer starts going on about how the stars exploded in the big bang.This book is given such good ratings because everyone wants to be politically correct and not be mean to the mentally challenged writer."
1,Pretentious Twaddle,"I read this one as a part of the book club - I've seen the book around and was interested but found it bitterly disappointing. There are gimmicks galore - the chapter numbers are in primes, there's several puzzles inserted into the text - but very little, if any substance. Additionally by writing the story from the point of the autistic teenager the author is limiting himself to a subset of language, emotions, etc - I'd have been much more impressed if the author told the story in the third person. We're all grown ups here, we can handle it.Don't bother, in short."
1,Truly Awful,"I had high expectations for this book, I really did. It did have a great cover. However, it was bad. The big joke was the back cover comparing the book as similar to Catcher in the Rye. The only thing similar to that book was that the narrator talked directly to the reader. That's about all the similarities I saw. Seriously people, if you're getting this book to find out more about autism, just rent rainman and save yourself some time.Towards the end of this book I was just thinking to myself: ""Get on with it, I get it, he has autism."" Don't waste your time on this. It's an example of manufactured hype. This is my first book from the ""Today Show Book Club."" If they liked this, it will be my last."
3,"interesting idea, poor exicution","alright.. kind of like reading sci fi in that the idea behind the book is interesting, but the book itself kind of falls flat. a very quick read."
3,A Curious Point of View,"Fifteen year old Christopher is the narrator of this curious book. Christopher has Asperger's Syndrome, which means that he is extremely intelligent, but lacking social graces. Wellington, Christopher's neighbors dead dog is discovered by Christopher who is accused of murdering Wellington.Like his hero Sherlock Holmes, Christopher likes to solve mysteries and so he sets out to solve the mystery of Wellington's death. Eventually Wellington's murderer is discovered and the steps leading up to his clues provide insight into Christopher's own family life. The journey along the way provides the reader with some of Christopher's quirks, like not being able to eat yellow or brown foods, screaming when someone touches him and the fact that seeing four yellow cars in a row will guarantee a black day.The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a short, sweet, and refreshing book with many drawings and illustrations to help readers understand Christopher's point of view."
2,Maybe I just don't get it....,"I picked this book up at a discount used bookstore hoping to really love it.....based on all the reviews and comments I had seen online. The book itself even has pages and pages of rave reviews.....For me it just didn't work. I appreciate the story and what the author is trying to accomplish, and he does accomplish it. It's a very real look at an autistic life. Christopher is a well developed character. I thought the story lacked luster and ended abruptly. But, it's a quick and easy read. I would not recommend this book. I found it somewhat painful to get through. Maybe that's part of the point. You feel dreadfully stuck in the mind of an autistic person and for that I respect it greatly."
1,"Stereotypical, contrived story","My son has autism, we live with autism, my friends are parents of children with autism, from my viewpoint Mark Haddon's book was an dispassionate rehashing of a younger Dustin Hoffman's Rainman character in London...not completely disagreeable, but I found it insulting and limiting to people with autism. In the search to keep the story interesting, Mr. Haddon uses Kurt Vonneguts' clever drawing style. I wish there was something new and fresh here, but it was a tired cliche of unconscious people doing unconscious things in a dirty dark world. Even the writing style was arduous like freshman writing for college composition class. yawn."
2,Lots of Gimmicks,"The story is set up very well but goes nowhere. The world(present day England)from inside the mind of 15/y.o. autistic(or some similar syndrome)boy. Loaded with lots of gimmicks to fill up pages and make it look like a real book--lists, footnotes, sketches, diagrams, puzzles, maps, doodles, graphs and even an appendix. After 15 pages inside Christopher's mind one gets the basic feeling of how he sees the world and reacts to it. I personally don't think one needs 226 pages to get this across. After the first one third of the book the story became repetitive, tedious and boring."
1,Curious Praise For This Book,"Actually I don't think it deserves even one star. Our Book Club read this book and not one member gave it much praise. It is a painful book to read. I am not sure why anyone would read it pr for that matter why anyone would waste time writing it It is narrated by the main character, a 15 year old boy who has autism. It is like listening to someone sing in a monotone. Read a medical book to learn about autism. Not one of our members really even wanted to finish the book. Would definitely not recommend it to anyone except maybe my worst enemy."
1,I must be outta the loop...,"While I admire the author's attempt to portray the life of an autistic boy, I found myself skimming though the book. I got very tired reading about Christopher's descriptions of life and things. The pictures, graphs and charts were a bit much. I couldn't believe how QUICKLy the book ended- I was like ""That's it?"" I think this got such rave reviews because it's a ""Different"" sort of genre- but don't expect it to be a classic."
1,guilt/fad reading...,"this book tried too hard to attain what all authors know is the holy grail of writing: creating something new. Yet the story is dull, the writing generic and elementary, and the story is cliche. My biggest complaint, however, is that the main character is portrayed as nearly stupid and compassionless. There is a notion that because autistic people have difficulties with communication and/or other social interactions, that they are just as awkward in their minds. This is far from true; what happens inside cannot always be translated to outside, but it does not mean that complexities are impossible inside. I would have preferred the story to show the complexities inside his mind and how he struggles to translate those to daily life; the boy from the inside out, not the outside in. Don't assume that what we see on the outside is basically all there is inside."
2,Not worthy of the hype...,"Upon reading the reviews, I expected alot more than I found in these pages. Plenty of repetition, unrealistic scenarios, and yet another fine look at family dysfunction.I read it through to be fair, and these were some painful pages to turn. The premise is unusual, and while it was most likely a challenge to write, it doesnt deserve all the fanfare. By the end I was only tired and disappointed."
1,Extremely Boring,"This book is very very very boring. The greatest thing about the book is the way the author shows you how the boy thinks. However, the characters, plot, and ending all make you want to fall asleep in the middle of the book."
1,You've got to be kidding,"After lurching through the analness of this book, it was definitely a book that I could put down. Although written in the same vein as ""Catcher in the Rye"", and written from the viewpoint of a 15 year old emotionally challenged lad, it was droll, to say the least. Originally purchased for my daughter, I have since decided that it is better for a charity to make 50 cents from."
2,Never understood the hype around it,"I bought this book because of all the great reviews attached to it. However, I just finished it and I can't be but disappointed at it. It is a well researched book indeed, with all its maths and logic problem, but that is basically it. I didn't find it insightful in any way. I guess the way it was written was boring.A good book leaves emptiness in your life after you finish it, this one hasn't!"
3,Good dogs gone dead,"We found it very frustrating that the kid was smarter than us, but we identified with his lack of emotion and inability to bond with people. However, we sympathize with the mother for hating the father for putting her letters to the son she abandoned in a size 11 shoe box when she was really a size 7 (see proof in Appendix).The strongest character, in our opinion, was the grocer.We enjoyed coloring the pictures in the book.Signed,The Ribbons and Rifles Book Club...tune in for next month's book review."
3,Animal Murderer,"I was very intrigued by this book and would recommend it to others but the ending really bothered me--his dad is a murderer and a coward. (He killed an animal in rage and didn't tell anyone and since no one presses charges and since its ""just an animal"" he gets away with it.) And the ending seems to brush over this and instead holds promise and happpiness. He even gets Christopher a dog of his own. I say he should stay far away from ""Father""."
2,At least it wasn't a hard book to read,"The curious incident of the dog in the night-time, is about an autistic child named Christopher. Christopher is extremely smart, however, he can't understand human emotion. the book reads fairly easy, which is about the only good thing about the book. the author adds to the story alot of his atheist views, as well as alot of examples and drawlings that have no significants to the story. If you enjoy good reading, leave this one on the shelf. if you want alot of nothing, run out and buy this book."
1,What a load of garbage,"I won't waste my time giving details. Suffice to say that this book is a steaming pile of garbage full of stereotypes, cliches and foul language. Avoid at all costs.PS. Has anyone else noticed how all the 1-star reviews have low helpfulness ratings while the 5-star reviews have high helpfulness ratings? No doubt this is the work of die-hard ""Curious Incident"" fans. As a person on the Eragon board said, you rate reviews because you find them helpful, not because you don't agree with the content."
2,Huh?,"MANY GIVEAWAYS. DO NOT READ IF YOU INTEND TO READ THE BOOK!Thank goodness this was a quick read! Typical of many British novels, I was left with ""huh?"" It almost seemed to me that the author simply got tired of writing and wanted to end the story. Perhaps I was reading to much into it but:a) What happens to mum? Did she continue her life alone?b) What happens to dad?c) What happens to the Shears? Will they continue to hate each other?d) Way too much hate going on between those neighbors and lovers. It was left open.e) A golden retriever? From a pet rat to a dog that will grow to the size of a small pony??f) Dad stabbed a dog because he was angry? Thus dude needs some serious help!A book about the quest investigate a dead of a dog? More about how this dude lives in a hugely disfunctional family system. Odd story. Pretty much a waste of time."
1,not too much story development,"There's not too much story development, the so-called ""curious incident"" has been solved around 1/3 of this thin bk. But what's special about this bk is to let readers understand why an autistic would behave in some socially odd way (eg shouting/crying out of no reason, afraid to go to new places, like to count things, having obsession over some things). It's written in the 1st person thru the eyes of a 15-year old autistic.i'm sorry that i threw it away as soon as i finished reading it."
2,Can't Even Finish It,After reading all the reviews I thought this would be a great book. I am half way through and can't go on. I developed a dislike for Christopher's father and he way he treats Christopher. The book seems to drag.
2,Disappointing,"I was pretty disappointed by this book. The back cover makes it sound like a story that is absolutely nothing like the story is about. The main plot really has nothing to do with the dog, and not to sound offensive, but reading a book with an autistic narrotor is enough to give me a headache. There are so many added on random thoughts that it distracts from the flow of the story, and I ended up skippin to the ends of chapters. Had I known what I was getting myself into by reading it, I wouldn't have picked it up. Although if I was doing a study on autism, it would be a good book for perspective on it."
2,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,"I did not enjoy reading this book. I found it very confusing and boring. I understand this was written from an autistic persons view, but not being educated on autism, it made it frustrating to read."
4,A child psychiatrist's review,"I enjoyed this book -- and I often avoid novels because they are too much like work. I'm writing this review because readers should know that in the U.S., the protagonist would be diagnosed with high-functioning autism, and not Asperger's Disorder. The novelist conveys something of what it must be like to be autistic. I hope readers are also attuned to the devastation that the disorder causes to the family life. The book is inspiring -- when my day gets hard, I think of drawing a line on the floor and walking it..."
4,novel for our times,"When you pass through the mirror of irony, you get oddness often unaware of itself, sometimes pitiful, sometimes brilliant and unique. So although this novel is told from an autistic's point of view, I think it is more an allegory for ourselves, in this reality TV, internet age. Borat, and Little Miss Sunshine are dealing with this same problem -- of each and every one of us being an example of unwitting dramatic irony -- in different ways.This is a very good novel, a mystery novel, an insightful novel, one of personal triumph, a compassionate one, and a funny one. Will it last through the ages? Probably not, but still for this age, it's quite good."
2,"Great start, but the ending wasn't worth the read","I was very excited by the beginning of this story because it gave me insight into the minds of the autistic. The author did a great job of describing this character and reminded me of several autistic students that I've had as a teacher in the past. It seems though, that the author got too involved in the development of a great character and forgot to write a story. It just isn't a very interesting ride that the author takes you on. And, even if it was a story about how a character changes over time, he didn't accomplish this either. Don't waste your time with this one...I don't know what all these other reviewers could be so amazed by."
2,Couldn't get into it,"This book has a really interesting and unusual plot (a dog murder-mystery being solved by an autistic English boy--wow!). I give its author a lot of credit for creativity. However, I really couldn't immersed in the story and about halfway through I stopped reading. I wish I saw what everyone else does in this book, because I really wanted to like it.Don't let me stop you from reading it, though, because many of my friends loved it. Somehow it just wasn't my cup of tea."
2,Brilliant??! Hardly worth a look,"With sincerest apologies to anyone who is autistic, this book is horrid. First of all, the murder of the dog is solved halfway through - all that's left is a bunch of ramblings by the author about the autistic child's different way of seeing the world. Nothing new here. But, I've known autistic people who speak and write and who don't start 42 consecutives sentences or paragraphs with the word ""And"" .... as did happen in this book or at least until I got tired of counting them (there were more). In the last 40 pages or so, I only got the feeling that the author was trying to hurry to finish it and get to his next book."
5,A remarkable book,"A remarkable book, offering a remarkable journey through the mind of an exceptional character. The book's hero and narrator, Christopher Boone, could easily have become precious or irritating, but Mr. Haddon strikes a difficult balance. Christopher is wonderfully sympathetic--I suffered with him throughout his difficult and courageous journey to London--but he's also tremendously hard for others to fathom. I highly recommend this book."
