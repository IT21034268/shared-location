2,Very poor,"Although he seems to know the facts of the case quite well, anyone thinking that Walsh's analysis leads to a plausible reconstruction of the final days of Poe is mistaken. Among other things, his analysis of statements regarding Poe's appearance and the feelings of members of his fiancee's family seem quite overwrought. It seems as if he is trying get to his conclusion, instead of allowing his conclusion to flow from the reconstruction of the facts at hand. Moreover, even given the facts as he presents them, I think there are gaps in his reconstruction that cause the foundation of the book to list--like the leaning tower of Pisa--quite substantially. Granted, other previous conjectures seem implausible also, but this could take the cake. If I were a publisher, I would have rejected his book."
4,The Lost Four Days,"Edgar Allan Poe's strange death in 1849 has always been highly contraversial. There have been so many theories, some plausiable some not so plausiable. Mr. Walsh does a very crediable job in returning the reader back to Poe's time, reviewing all the witnesses and presenting his theory soundly. His writing at least in the beginning is a bit strange, he uses paragraph's were normally one would see a period. I believe this is a attempt in another way to capture the spirit of Poe, the mystery, the macabe, the sad end. Still, Mr. Walsh deserve's credit for producing a very quick and interesting read.."
2,DT's,"Edgar Allen Poe's death was a straightforward example of delerium tremens (withdrawal syndrome from ethyl alcohol) with fatal outcome, as should be apparent to most physicians. A good description of the case can be found in the recently published ""Postmortem,"" by Philip Mackowiak."
2,Doesn't deliver,"I found this in the True Crime Section and expected an interesting read. I never found it. What I received instead was a detailed description of the last days of Edgar Allan Poe leading up to, what I thought would be an interesting and definitive conclusion, nothing. The book just leaves the reader to swallow the author's boring hypothesis. This is a case where the truth is NOT stranger than fiction (at least in this presentation)."
5,"Now I can stop guessing...""Forevermore""","John Walsh's book is certainly a good read and the only people who seem to have trouble with it are people who don't understand that all the pieces of the puzzle aren't available and never will be. In situations like that, good investigative work has to be used--along with a good understanding of your subject and the times to make up situations not known. John Walsh certainly has both. I was thoroughly enthralled by his storytelling and even more impressed by his deductions and his careful telling of where he got his information. Of course, there are some things he doesn't know so he deduced them based on the knowledge at hand. If done intelligently (as done here), it will convince the reader. I think Edgar Allen Poe would rest easy knowing someone finally straightened out his last days."
4,"Great taste, minor noodle issue","This is a very delicious Chicken Helper, though Amazon ships a different version of the box, ""Italian Fettuccine Alfredo"". I've had problems with the noodles sticking together even with good stirring, but in the end it's not that big a deal. This just barely feeds my family of four because the kids tend to take twice as much as usual, so expect to use more than one box for 4+ people."
2,Not what I thought it was,This was not Nate Dogg's best. I Only like two songs. It is not what I thought it was. Oh well.
5,tbbucs14,"Classic album. One of the only Cd's that I have purchased twice. You can tell that Nate Dogg put this album together exactly how he wanted it. Aside from one or two songs, perfect."
5,Nate deserves more credit,"If Nate Dogg would be able to release this album in lets say 1995 it would have gone platinum. But for some reason he was held back on Death Row. Unfortenly it was released in 1997 ( Part I ) when every one already had turned east. But we true rap-music fans know that Nate Dogg's album is great. ""The hardest man in town"" and ""These days"" are the best songs on the album, and disc 1 is much better thann disc 2. But on the whole it's a great album. I hope Nate keeps delivering his original voice with gangsta lyrics on R n'B music, because it can't get much better."
4,Underrated Singer,"If Nate had been able to release his debut in 1995, as planned, he would've most likely been a big star. However, Nate didn't get his debut out til 97' (part 1.) By the time he got all of the songs he wanted recorded, it was 98', and the CD had turned into a two-disc album. By then, Nate hadn't had a hit since ""regulate,"" in 94', so everyone pretty much forgot about him. I don't think many even know he has an album out. Although there are some fillers, this CD has a good amount of tight R and B/Rap tracks, and some straight up blues tracks. Highlights include: ""These Days,"" ""Me and my Homies,"" ""Never Leave me Alone,"" ""I Don't Wanna Hurt No More,"" ""Just Another Day,"" ""It's Going Down Tonight,"" ""Sexy Girl,"" ""D.P.G-ville,"" ""No Matter Where i Go,"" ""Crazy, Dangerous,"" and the classic outro, ""Never Too Late."" If you like artists like R. kelly or warren G, you'll like this CD."
5,Nate Dogg!!,"Ever since I started listening to Warren G, I've been real curious about Nate Dogg. Then, the single ""Nobody Does It Better"" came out!! It was DA BOMB!! Then I checked Amazon.com to see if there were any Nate Dogg albums. There were, so I went out and I listened to it. It's DA BOMB!! His smooth R&B combined with Warren G, Snoop Dogg, and Tupac etc... is just.....again.. DA BOMB!!! I'll close it at that!! All I gotta say is, get it!"
3,Pretty good,"This is a good album but I think it was 1 disc too many. The best songs are G-Funk, Bag O Weed, Me & My Homies, My Money, Never Leave Me Alone, Puppy Love, Dogg Pound Gangstaville, and Nobody Does It Better. Check it out. It's worth listening to"
5,Simply the greatest horror I've ever read!,"This is far and away the greatest horror I have read. Nailed clean in the style that Skipp and Spector mastered so well, a craftily ironic tone that your own mind uses in its more honest moments, this constantly claustrophobicly narrowing vision of the environmental haulocaust to come grabs you by the short and curlies demands that you should SIT RIGHT BACK and hear of the coming tribulation. The deftness which with it was handled, the delecate suspension of disbelief holds even with the fantastic swirling and gelling. They were the best horror going in the '80s and early '90s, no debate and bar none. I miss them all the time, and boys and girls, this is as good as it got. Maybe the best it could get."
2,Not up to par of other Authors I enjoy,"I'm a big King & Koontz fan and I was researching for other authors/books that could entertain me. I saw many suggestions for King & Koontz fans to try this book, so I did. NOT a fan. The idea of toxic waste that's dumped into our waterways coming to life and taking over like invasion of the body snatchers just seems silly to me. I finished the book, but only because I have a compulsion to finish books once I start them. It was boring and predictable, which, when coupled with the discontect due to the age of the book, wasn't worth it to me."
1,WASTE INDEED,"Toxic waste gets a life of its own. Great! I love that concept! But what's this? The waste is an intelligent force taking over minds and bodies? Spirit guides? Magick? Lawn ornaments coming to life? What the hell? Yeah, all those are factors in this book that work against it making the story more and more ridiculous as it progresses. Not only that, but the whole thing is an overly preachy ""serious"" attempt to warn its readers of the dangerous chemicals that surround us in everyday life and how they effect the earth spirit. Ugh! I absolutely hated this thing! It's a PSA made by hippies thinly disguised as a horror book."
3,Mediocre.,"** spoiler alert **Actually rather disappointing. It did not really hold my interest until the death roll started climbing up and the demises got more creative. It is supposed to be a novel of ecological horror, but truly it is not it. It is a novel about the monster of the hour, the ecological disaster moments tacked on and, frankly, tacky. I was also bothered by the lack of in-the-book logic, as the Overmind's transformations sweep through the victims. Plenty of gore in the second part of the book, if that is your thing. Rot, liquification and horrific body mods. People dying or going insane. (Or going insane and then dying.)In short, get a used copy or borrow."
1,Wa wa waaaaaa,Other reviews stated that this book was scary.... it's not. I was not impressed nor given an inclination to finish; one word review = Lame.
5,Novo Millenium -Tamba Trio,"This set is Brazillian bossa nova at its finest. I really enjoy listening to the blending of the trio's voices and the soothing rhythms of the bossa nova. Also because this set has so many tracks, you can put it on during a long drive, open the windows, and imgagine being in sunny Brazil as the sun is setting on the beaches of Sao Paulo. I can't wait to buy more of their music."
4,detailed account of medieval military tactics,"Santosuo has given us a wonderfully researched history of medieval warfare. The book covers from the Barbarian tribes of the 6th century to the Mongol and Turk empires of the 15th century. Most of the major military engagements are covered along with the notable leaders of the respective periods. I found the general discussions of the political and military situations very interesting. But I got bogged down in the details concerning the make up of various armies. This work is a highly detailed account of tactics, formations and arms and equipment. Anyone interested in the nuts and bolts of medieval warfare will enjoy this book."
2,Too Much Too Little,"This book is a rather superficial skim of the Middle Ages. Perhaps adequate for a reader looking for a quick overview of the era but not for serious students of the times.The ""Inheritance of Rome: Illuminating the Dark Ages"" is more readable and far better with information"
5,LOVED IT,"I got this for my mother and her sisters for a gift, they loved the music and 3 cd's !!, GET IT !!"
4,Luxury For Your Hair,"This product is the only conditioner I have found that can give me that smooth healthy just colored feeling, all day long. It's like I just stepped out of the salon every day!!! It comes in a 750ml (25.36 fl. oz) bottle with a handy pump dispenser. It's a perfect companion for the Fashionista Shampoo, which comes similarly packaged. Unlike some other conditioners, Catwalk 'Fashionista' by Tigi is color safe and won't hasten the fading of your color. Altogether a great product!!!"
3,Smaller than advertised,"This guest book is not 8' by 10'. I measured it, and it is only 7' by 9.5'. The description should be corrected, because it is much smaller than I expected."
2,Needs to enunciate...,"I like Karan Casey's sweet, childlike voice, but I wish she'd try enunciating a little. Consonants are important, too! Plus, with her slight lisp and tendency to fade out the end of words, I find it very difficult to understand the words she sings. And since a lot of the songs tell stories, that's a real problem. Thank goodness the lyrics are published in the liner notes. When I listen to music sung in Gaelic, I realize I won't understand the words and can appreciate the music anyway. However, these songs are sung almost entirely in English, but with her singing style, they might as well be in Gaelic. With a couple of exceptions (Buile Mo Chroi being one), I was bored with this album. On top of being unintelligible, the songs are sung and arranged very similarly. Her first album, Songlines, shares these problems, but to a lesser extent."
3,It works,"Basic functionality at a basic price. You can get decent pics if you set capture for high quality and hold steady when you snap the picture. Mine came with an SD card I wasn't expecting. All in all, decent value for what you pay. Don't expect a $200 camera for $70."
1,If you liked Apache Promise do not read this book!!!,This book is the sequel(if you can call it that) to Apache Promise however the heroine of the first book is killed off in a scene which we never read about to make way for the new heroine who was a 10 year old child in the first book. I have liked Ms. Hudson's other books and I grabbed this one in a hurry only to find out in the first two pages that instead of more to the story Angela and Matt it was Matt's love story with another woman. I tried to read it but could never get into the story because I had read the first one. Romance should be about fairy tale endings where everything works out right in the end....[spoiler] When I read a romance I want to finish it with a good feeling not feeling as though I had been robbed!!!!
3,It was good,"I thought this book was good. But the relationship between Matt and Serena kept me from fully enjoying the book. Overall, the author is once again successul of crafting a spellbounding book. She is top notch developing the plot and the characters. But, as I said before, the relationship and the previouas bond that the two lovers shared turned me off of the book."
5,"Excelente Libro, Mejor no hay","Se los recomiendo ampliamenteeste libro lo tiene todoMi esposa y yo, no estudiamos nada para tener un bebeConsultamos por internet algunas cosas pero a veces unos dicen si haz esto y otros no mejor esto otroEste libro te dice la verdad, ademas esta segunda edicion esta muy actualizada, tiene cosas nuevas como si quieres tranquilizarlo sal en el carro a dar una vueltaTe dice que va a ahacer tu hijo el siguiente mes, etc..Hasta ahora que llevo casi 3 meses ha acertado en todoAdemas, es baratisimo, pues tiene muuuuuchas paginasEs toda una biblia, ni sacandole copias es tan barato como comprar el originalDe verdad se los recomiendo bastanteMaRtYnMTY-Mexico"
4,Comentario desde España,"Buen libro de referencia y consulta, especialmente para padres primerizos. Al seguir principalmente los protocolos norteamericanos es buen elemento de comparación con tus propios estándares sanitarios nacionales."
2,Cheap for a reason,After 4 1/2 months water got in between the metal sides and plastic liner. I took it apart and spread some Plasti Dip around the bottom where it comes apart and put it back together. I'll see how that works. It's cheap for a reason so if you need something to last a long time spend a few bucks more.
3,Shoddy assembly,"I bought two of these mugs for a gift, and one is fine, but the second, when I first tried to removedthe lis, fell apart. The inner lining wasn't glued down well at all, and I was able to pull the entire thing apart.Seeing as I bought two, I'm worried that the other one will fail as well, but at the moment, it's in the optimal condition.I experienced a 50/50 chance of a worthwhile product. If I so choose, I'll end up gluing it myself, but you shouldn't have to do that with an already assembled object. I'd give it a lower score, but at the moment, I still recieved one good product. So far."
2,cheap mug,It is similar to a cheap dollar store mug. It looks and feels cheap and leaks a bit. Not worth the little money it cost!.
1,Cheap construction,"I had previously given this product a high review, but after using the mug for a few months it fell apart. The 3 screws holding the liner in place rusted and because of that the bottom fell off. I tried to do some repair which helped for a while, but then the whole thing just came apart as I was washing it. I used it 5 days a week and therefore washed it 5 days a week. I guess if you never wash it you might be alright. Also, there is no insulation to keep your drink warm or cold.I did have this style mug before and the same thing happened to that one.Not any chance I would buy this again, which is a shame because it is a perfect size for me."
1,Maxam 14 oz stainless steel travel mug,This mug is the shape I wanted but DON't BUY! It fell part just a couple of days after arrival!
1,cheaply made,Bought this for my husband and within the first 2 weeks the inside part of the mug separated from the outside. Guess I got what I paid for.
2,Works great with cold drinks but not with hot ones.,I bought the mug to use during a 45 minute morning commute. After 20 to 30 minute the coffee is stone cold. Works great with cold drinks.
1,Stainless steel mug,"This mug would not hold anything without spilling all over. I had to throw it out. The lid did not seal and the glue between the inside of the mug and the frame was missing. As soon as the travel mug was titlted, between the loose seal, and the non-existant glue, this was an non-functioning mug."
3,Questionable quality,"I purchased 2 of these mugs for my husband to use on his way into work. When the mugs arrived, both had their plastic inserts falling out of the stainless container. Nothing a little glue couldn't fix, but it's a pain to have to fix a brand new item."
1,DOA,"Cheap mug, which if fine, it it actually worked. The inner plastic part slid right out of the metal cup as soon as I opened the box. Complete junk. The lid was actually decent, although the ""seal"" was a little more that a rubber band around the lid, with no channel to keep it in place."
1,Not quite what is shown in the image! DISSAPOINTED!,"The mug I received actually differs from the mug shown in the image. Cover, handle, design, shape - all is slightly, but visibly different! The quality is below average. Very disappointed!"
3,Maxam 14oz Stainless Steel Travel Mug,"It's OK for the price; it will lick if upside down, the outside will get more than worm if really hot liquid is in it, and so you have to hold it by the handle. It's good for one hour of hot coffee. The greatest disadvantage is that the interior is plastic, in time it may give the content a plastic flavor. When you put your lips to the rim it feels thick and a little uncomfortable. It does serve its purpose though."
1,Don't waste your money,Was told be Jabra representative that this model provides better sound for those having difficultly hearing. Not only does it NOT provide better sound (actually better off just using the phone) but people at the other end complaint about the sound and noise from the microphone.
2,Lackluster,"No, this performance is not horrible, but it's lackluster, even boring.Matti Salminen is the best there is, maybe the best there ever has been, at some roles (Hagen, Fasolt, Grand Inquisitor), but not Sarastro. His bottom is painfully dry and the part gives him no opportunity to use his volcanic top. He doesn't sound German or Mozart-y at all! Also, he's kind of creepy. Sarastro should be stern and awesome, but not creepy.The best ZAUBERFLOTE I have seen on video is the one conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch, with Lucia Popp and Kurt Moll, a true infra-bass."
1,Bad sets. Egyptians garbed like Catholics,"What happens on the stage has none of the fun you look for. A bare-breasted woman hauling in a snake?Some Egyptian priests have on lace-fringed surpluses, looking like Catholic priests. Altar boys in the background. Women wearing crosses nestled in their cleavages?The director really screwed this one up. Listen to CDs, and use your imagination."
2,Not so hot,"Great features, not so hot. Food comes out as is if it was steamed. Trays are with in a few months already loosing there non sick coating."
3,Colour Fades,The first Tweety cover I purchased held its colour over 12 months however the material did not wear well. This 2nd cover from a different supplier has a far superior cover concerning the material used however the yellow faded within 6 months. Tweety just doesn't look that same. Would have rated 5 stars if the colour did not fade in such a short period of time.
4,I liked it even though it's an overdone theme,Every cartoon series does a Christmas episode and Hey Arnold is no different. It's cute even if it's an overdone theme. I'd still recommend it.
2,Great title but little tape (LP),"Arnold is always the best for kids, but why would you record a premium and expensive cartoon in LP mode. Seriously, how much money did they save by eliminating a few feet of inexpensive VHS Tape?"
3,Nice Step Back Onto the Scene for Warren G.,"Since the G Child has relatively disappeared from pop-culture fame, he has left a good score of followers and fans. All true Warren G fans will appreciate this duet with his long-time sidekick, Nate Dogg. The song has the typical smooth G-Funk, but it doesn't satisfy the hunger for those listeners awaiting G's followup album to Take a Look Over Your Shoulder. Hopefully his next few singles will exceed the popularity of this song."
4,awesome!,"I like this book. first of all, it is very difficult to find anything substantial on this language. if you understand linguistics, this will work for you. it breaks it down it detail. this is not a standard language learning book like others you would find in the store but if you already know some of the language, it will clarify some of the minor details. It comes with a CD-rom so you can hear the language as well. I really enjoyed the chapter on the history of the capeverdean language. Too bad it is so expensive but I think that will force me to read it cover to cover since I boughtit for leisure reading instead of a class."
3,A good start,"Having never seen any other King of Bandit Jing, this was a good introduction. it gave me a taste and a story with out having to get invested in the whole series."
2,nothing but number 1's of the sixties,"I must say that I was very disappointed with this album for one simple reason: it is almost entirely made up of re-recordings. The one exception is Good Timin' by Jimmy Jones. Normally I'm not so picky but some of these recordings sounded completely different to the originals! The whole point of me buying this album was to get these in original versions. If these could just have been cleaned up this would have been better than giving us totally new recordings that take the uniqueness away from them. Without the picture of the cover I could not tell that they were re-recordings. Now to be fair, the sound quality was excellent and for me personally the chosen collection was good because they included some songs that are harder to find than others of the same era. But I just don't like them modernised. If you don't mind, then it's a good buy. Otherwise, buyers beware if you like your versions original!"
2,Not the quality you expect,Be sure to listen to a few previews before purchasing this album. My guess is that these recordings are very early versions of the original songs.
3,Disapointed,"I would like to return this album, but we all know how that doesn't work. This is not what I was expecting."
5,I'm Speechless!,"...I absolutely loved this book!!! I can't write a book review to save my life but this was a 10 star book all the way. As soon as I put this down I was ready to read the sequel...only to realize it was out of print and was too expensive to buy... The action keeps you going, the bravery and heroism that young Meliara must demonstrate is an awesome experience. I was astounded by this book. I re-read it so many times I practically know it by heart. Read it! It's sooo COOL!!!"
4,Pretty good,"This is really two books in one, although I believe the author always planned to release them this way. The book was a page turner, for sure, and I enjoyed the character development. I would recommend this for a younger reader who enjoys pretty standard fantasy fare. I guess the reason I didn't give this higher marks is that I can't remember much about the book just a week or two after finishing. So, while entertaining, somewhat unremarkable."
5,"If you're looking for a twinky fantasy to just fly through in an hour, skip this one. If you're serious, read it NOW.","I found this book casually browsing the teen section in my local library. I picked it up, & added it to my stack, thinking, 'oh, I'll get around to reading it sometime.'That sometime was about a week later, when I'd blown through all my Madeliene L'engle books, on the way to church. Once I read the first page, I didn't want to close it. I spent that afternoon reading & reading. I read it all in about three days.It's a fantasy, yes, but--it's a BELIEVABLE fantasy. All the details about the government system & the fashion changes throughout the decades made it seem as if this world were an actual place. It is one of my favorite books.I am now reading this book through for the fifteenth time (yes, I've actually counted), & one of the main reasons I wish to go into the film industry is so I can make a faithful representation of the book come to life on the screen.So--cheers. Enjoy."
4,Mel bugs me sooo much,This is a cool book.I am really annoyed i bought the separate hardbacks but i suppose it was worth it .It is DEFINATLY worth it at this price.Court duel(part 2)Is the best as Mel is not quite as annoying and the Shevraeth thing gets tied up.Just imagine how annoying it was for me getting to the end of book one with Mel still hating him.I wish boys were really like Shevraeth he is sooo cute and sweet. All cool guys are in books it is so unfair.Other people say it is slow in part.I suppose it is but there is enough action to balance it out.I feel as if Shev and mel are a part of me.That is how well I feel I know them.The reason I only gave it 4 stars was that Mel BUGS ME BIG TIME.She makes so many obvious mistakes and spoils things for Shevraeth so many times.She is a stupid girl in the first book.
2,It doesn't get more contrived than this...,"Ok, maybe lovers of fantasy for more than 30 years (like myself) should think twice before reading novels like this one. I downloaded it, after so many glowing recommendations, but eventually was almost shouting at my Kindle in frustration by about page 300 at so many lame plot lines. The brave, wonderful, miraculously-getting-out-of-the-most-absurd-situations heroine (Mel) is *so* dense, she doesn't get that her mysterious correspondent is the oft (inexplicably) hated Shevraeth. Doi. Her brother, Bran, and pretty much *all* the other secondary characters in this book, are used and then conveniently disappear from the plot. I guess that some of the other reviewers have it right -- if you are a teenage girl who has the most simplistic appreciation of the most basic plot tricks -- this book is definitely for you. For me, it left a really bad taste in my mouth - this probably was the first book that I stopped reading with about 5 percent left. Sigh."
1,Just terrible...,"I'm sorry I bought this book. There are so many reviews that make this book out to be wonderful, but in the end I was deeply disappointed.I'll cut right to the point. The main character is absolutely unbearable. She has no sense, she's irrational, can't do anything on her own, and the moment of truth when she has a chance to defeat the bad guy? Forget it. She gets knocked out and someone bails her out. Then everyone makes her out to be a hero. Maybe it's me, but seems like the message being conveyed is ""ladies, save the day by just staying on your back"".The intrigue is doesn't exist, guerrilla ambushes are silly jokes, the great conflict is over wood, about 95% of character and city names are pretentious, it's predictable, and there are just too many conversational similes."
1,Oy vey.,"What a bad book. The plot was painfully predictable, the characters porridge, the setting neither innovative nor convincing (with minor changes, the story could have been as convincingly set in a modern-day American mall as in a pseudo-mediaeval setting, considering the bland gender neutrality and unrealistically modern way the characters act). The settting seemed poorly researched as well (I remember doing a double-take when a farmer's storage hut had a metal roof on which rain could patter. Right, so every impoverished peasant can have corrugated steel rooves. What's next, oil-fired central heating?).The biggest turn-off, however, was the writing, which was unremittently juvenile and littered with infelicities. There was a time when 'young people's fantasy' was not mutually exclusive with 'good literature'; instead of reading a booger like 'Court Duel', I suggest you curl up with Lewis Carroll's 'Sylvie and Bruno', for example."
4,Nice gentle romance,This is a wonderful light book with a strong female character and a gentle romance. It is suitable for both teens and adults. The the romantic tension between the Marquis and the heroine is lovely. From the authors' blog we may get to enjoy other books set in the same world.
4,Excellent Read!,"I really enjoyed this book a lot. I usually love books where the main character gets captured, and escapes, gets captured again, and escapes again... and this one really did it well! The characters were all fairly well thought out, but I did feel that Mel didn't always act her age. Also, the romance was completely predictable. I don't want to give it away, but when you first meet the ""unknown"" I knew instantly what would happen. A few aspects of the created world didn't fit for me. Mostly the magic, fire sticks, and Code of War. It's like the author had an idea that they liked a lot and weren't willing to give it up. The climaxs were a little iffy. Not bad in the first one, but I felt the second one didn't have quite enough info leading up to it. Even though I've criticized it this much, I still loved it! You finish it and immediately wish to read it again. I really hope the author decides to write more with these characters, or at least in the same world."
3,For Die Hard Fans only,"One of Broadway's all-time greatest musical scores was of course captured by Columbia in 1966 and it is hard to top. Though Jay Records recording does include much of the score never recorded before (""The Rescue"" & ""Subway"" to name a few) the overall excitement of this recording is diminished due to the extremely SLOW tempos the musical director has chosen to take. Jacqueline Dankworth is an odd choice to record Charity (any one of our American musical theater stars, Ziemba, Neuwirth, Peters might have done more interesting work with the material.) For Die hard fans of ""Charity"" only."
3,Engaging book on why Stonehedge was built,This book reads like a well-written Ph.D. thesis on the notion that ancient Britons built Stonehenge for the purpose of tracking the orbits of the Sun and Moon to facilitate the prediction of solar and lunar eclipses. His extensive proofs are a fairly convincing argument on that point. He doesn't get too much into how Stonehenge was built(clearly a spectacular acheivement for the Stone Age) or why orbits and eclipses would have been important to an ancient people. This is a scientific treatment which glosses over the anthropological and mystical meanings of the monument.
4,"Not the best of the series, but certainly worthwhile","This time Nick and Nora (and Asta, of course) get themselves embroiled in the murder of a jockey--at the racetrack, no less! This along with helping out a reporter friend whose girlfriend's boss is involved in shady dealings.But none of this really matters, because the main reason to watch these films has always been the wisecracking chemistry between William Powell and Myrna Loy. And with characters named Link, Whitey, and Rainbow Benny, how can you go wrong?Plus, there's a bonus! At Nick, Jr.'s insistence, Nick actually drinks a glass of milk!"
3,Don't ask for Tomorrow,"Kate hires skipper Sean McGregor to help prove that her late husband had discovered the wreck, the Belle Etoile. Sean had worked with her husband, and guards a secret concerning him. But Kate soon discovers that she must give up the past-or beray her love."
5,Hulk Vs Abomination,"Wow!, what a great issue in Bruce Jones Hulk run. The Story is awesome the government hire Emil Blonsky (Abomination) to hunt done Bruce Banner , but abomination has a personal vendetta with Bruce. Banner meets a woman in a cafe and shares some attraction to her but, it is revealed to be Blonsky wife and the tables turn. The story is good complex and has pushed Jones's run continuing the arc of the story with things about the hard disc that the government are all fighting over then it is reveled what is on the disc. The artwork is incredible very colorful and beautiful at times. The ending fight is amazing between Hulk and Abomination reminds me a lot of the Incredible Hulk Movie which heavily pulled material from this series.Overall if your a Hulk fan and you want a good Hulk Vs Abomination Story this is it. Also If your a fan of the film and wanna now what source material the pulled from check out Bruce jones run. There's only one word to describe this book Incredible!!!!!"
2,Did not come with a pump,Received this item at an APO (overseas) address within a week! However it did not come with a pump and I can not use it!
3,A little disappointed,"I ordered this shirt for a funny gift for a friend's birthday. There was a typo on the shirt so it read ""This Two Gentlemen of Verona"". I didn't have time to return it before his birthday and it kind of added to the humor of the gift, but I would hesitate to order something else from this vendor again."
4,Excellent companion piece,"This book is for the fan who has followed Grendel from the early eighties. The story retells the original story of Susan, a disenchanted Grendel in search of her redemption in the form of Grendel Prime. The book expands a little on the Grendel story line. In this respect it makes is a good companion piece to the fans of the comic book line. As a stand alone story the book does well until the end where you are left hanging. Hopefully more of the stories will be presented in this genre. I have enjoyed the novelizations of some of the comic lines, and to some this may be a ""legitimate"" way to enjoy comic books. Additionally, the price is not all that bad. As a trade paperback it is far less than a hardcover, and with the Wagner artwork the price is easily justified."
4,can be frustrating,I've been stumped on the 3rd trial for weeks. Although fun it can be very frustrating because you must move to the same places numerous times before it lets you pick up the clue you need. I have an old DS and maybe there is more control buttons on the newer version. Don't recommend this for someone with very little patience.
5,Great game!,"This is the first game I bought when I got my DS, great game, if you like investigating and crime solving games. I really don't mind reading and the characters are so funny sometimes that you really get into the story. Great game overall, recomend it!"
5,Are you an Ace Attorney?,"""Okay, an Ace Attorney? What's that?"" Crossed my mind as my older (and much wiser) brother advised me to play it, boy was I in for it.For being a 13 year-old and not knowing what an attorney is, was a pretty sad thing to admit, an even sadder thing to admit was the fact I never played or heard of Phoenix Wright. Let me tell you my friend, THAT is a mistake I will never make again!This game will have you playing for hours on end, and make you want to move right along to the next game in the series. Solving your cases, listening to testimonies, providing evidence, investigating crime scenes, and the starter of the famed expression ""OBJECTION!!"" This game is simply amazing.The music is very simple, yet moving, especially the objection theme.Five cases, that's pretty hard to beat. Buy it NOW."
2,Objection! For passing this off as a puzzle game!,"I was extremely disappointed in the game. While the storyline seemed ok, and I thought we were getting somewhere, with each case, it just became more and more laborious to wade through the repetitive dialog with completely overblown gestures. It is very distracting to see a character swearing while you're still left wondering ""what just happened?""I finished about 3 cases and found it very tiresome to stick with it. I have no interest at all in continuing, so it's going straight back to the store.To be fair though, I got this game hoping it would be another Prof Layton, so that was probably setting the bar too high to start with!If the path to getting through the cases didn't seem so tiresome and laborious, it wouldn't be a bad game at all.Bottom line - if like me, you're looking for another puzzle game to follow Prof Layton, Phoenix is not the way to go.If you're looking for a game to kill time with and are not a zealous puzzling fan, this may be ok."
1,Fun but WAY too much clicking,"The over all concept for the game was great, but am I the only one out here that wants to play for more than 10% of the time? Every time I started to get somewhere in the game, I had to click 100s of dialog boxes. Of course story is important, but these were just childish interactions between the characters that served no plot purpose. My hand got pretty numb continuously clicking next with the stylus, then realized every single function in the game can be done with the buttons.The concept was fantastic. I loved the cases and solving them, but in between the court cases was just plain dumb. This game embodied everything anime and Japaneseie.By the third case, I put it down for good. I might try the next game in the series, but this one is done for me."
1,Am I missing something?,"After reading all the glowing reviews for this game, I cannot believe how incredibly dull and tedious it was. I gave up in the middle of the third case. The only reason I got that far was that I assumed I was missing something, that surely it must get better. I did not find this game to be challenging at all, it's a matter of reading through page after page of text, clicking on everything in a room to get all the evidence, and presenting everything you've got in court. I see no comparison between this and games where you actually have to solve puzzles, like Myst or the Nancy Drew games."
5,<3,"I have played A LOT of video games that claim to challenge the intellect of the player and to have an engaging story line, for this game it is absolutely true! this is one of my favorite games/ game series i have played every single one and would play them again (which says a lot about the story line) this game holds my attention 100% of the time is just flat out fun to play. All in all it truly deserves all five stars."
2,Not my favorite ds game,"I purchased this game after reading all the great reviews and I'm glad I bought it used. Still, I feel I paid too much for it. Maybe if I were a kid I would like it better. Gets tedious at times, characters are silly to say the least. Granted, I'm only through half of it, but I'm already thinking of sending it off to one of my grandkids or trading it in to gamestop. I'm a big fan of the mystery case files and pop cap games and thought I would like this and other games of this type, but it just doesn't do much for me."
5,Fun!,"I got this for Christmas, wasn't sure what I would think of it; I love it! I never finished a game in my life but I finished this one in less than a week!Starts off pretty easy and gets harder progressively. It is a lot of fun, kind of addicting :)"
2,not as represented,"This product was represented as using Virgin rubber....no odor. It is NOT. The rubber is reconstituted and it smells. Thank God I only have this pair. All my other dumbbells are Durabells, true virgin rubber, with no odor."
1,hard to install,"I was excited about this product because it would save water while shaving,etc.,and the gallons saved would be worth the price. However we could not install it as the teeth were not grooved correctly for application onto both of our showers' existing pipe (which are new in last 8 years). Then the rubber gasket just broke off from handling the item. We used correct plumbing wrenches to install it, and it ended up just making new threads as the metal was too soft to thread correctly. Never had the chance to use it, and see if it would work :-( We hope others have better results from it, and we sent ours back, which was refunded without problem and quickly ;-)"
4,Encyclopedia of the Deryni series,"Not a novel, this book offers information on every character, location and other feature you could possibly want to know about the Deryni universe. Includes references for the short stories as well as the novels. If it's been a while since you've read part of the series and you don't want to get lost in the context the next time you start one, try this guide, it'll help.This book is perhaps best suited for the longtime fan, who owns or has read most of the novels. New fans might enjoy trying one of the regular books first."
4,Background info,"This wasn't what I expected, but I found it fascinating. The biographical information echoed what was in the Deryni stories already printed, but there was additional information about some of the time periods and characters that may presage future books. I hope so, for I have enjoyed the Deryni saga immensely and would hate to see it come to an end."
4,Great reource for Deryni fans,"This book is an excellent addition to your library if you are a fan of Katherine Kurtz's Deryni stories. I started re-reading the books recently after many years, and the Codex has been a great way to refresh my memory and pick up on cross-references that I had either forgotten or never realized before, as well as filling in earlier history of the Deryni world that I never knew.I give the Codex Derynianus four out of five stars. The main defects are inadequate genealogical tables in the back and a woefully incomplete and frustrating series of maps. The maps seem to be only initial sketches; they lack a lot of information, have a number of obvious misspellings (and over-written corrections,) and don't have any over-lapping areas to make it clear how each map relates to the others (even just a one page overall map would have been a big help.) If the book ever gets re-published in a new edition, I hope the publisher will at least have the map section re-done."
1,disapointed,This product was not as I expected. It is much weaker than ones used in the past. It certainly was not worth the price I paid. I returned this item.
5,Perfect black patent pumps.,"These shoes fit extremely well and are JUST what I wanted. They are very smart & dare I say, quite sexy because the heels are fairly high. I was able to put them on and wear them comfortably for most of the day (which is very good for brand new shoes). I would definetely shop for this brand, with this supplier again.Top marks to the supplier, all information was correct, the price was excellent and very speedy delivery."
5,Yea baby,"I just recently listened to these songs, and I fell in love! I have pretty much all of REM's CDs, making new songs a real treat to hear. When Reveal came out, I wasn't so impressed. Because of that minor disappointment, I wondered how I would like the next new material to come out. I'm just here to say I love it! I give REM all my love."
2,Good for beginners,"I was hoping this video would be more detailed. Actually it is VERY basic. For those of us that have experience it is a waste. For those that do not know a thing about what to do if cat has object embedded in body, or how to properly splint, or treat a burn then fine it's good for you."
4,"My review of the movie ""Release""","Possible spoiler alert.I must say that I am not always moved by a movie.I watch, I move on.Not so with this movie. I became so interested, so wrapped up, so invested in the characters and story that when the ending came and it was not what I was hoping for I was literally moved to frustration.This movie did what a good movie does. It got you wrapped up in the story and the characters and led you on an emotional ride.I come from an island where homosexuality and the homosexual lifestyle is still a crime and punishable. Parts of this story resonated with me because I was told the exact same thing that the priest in the movie told the main character.This is a movie well worth seeing.All I can say is ""Well done, well done""!"
1,release I did not. like.,cheep movie this. one. is. for. the. trash. can no real meaning. no. real activity. misleading. not. worth. watching. I dont. think I ever. seen. sutch. a bad. film in my life. I wouldent. wast. my money. on someting. that. you. would end. up puting. in the. trash. can any. way what. a wast
2,DARK & DISTURBING,"A very dark and disturbing film. Mercy killing, sadism, unrestrained evil, religious hypocrisy, guards who ignore abuse or even encourage it, some surreal dream sequences and a single loving relationship between a jailed former priest and the one decent guard that ends horrifically make this a movie enjoyable only by those who recognize such realities exist and can deal with it. If you like movies with happy endings this is not a film for you."
1,tortured pretentious waste of time,I don't know why I watched the whole thing. slow. vapid. no value. long silly sequences interspersed with viscious brutality. no character development. no message. just useless.
5,A great movie if you understand it is art..,"and not based on real world circumstances. Surreal art is just the artist's interpretation. The acting was supurb. Jack and Martin's love tore at my heart strings. Their love for each other is tender, real, and draws the viewer into its power. Max scared the hell out of me. Release deals with essential moral questions but doesn't resolve them. It asks us to seriously consider them. It's not at all a feel good movie. The setting and actions, which are shown graphically, are quite brutal, and liked surreal art, there are simply unanswered questions about the characters we are supposed to fill in for ourselves. The ending is absolutely unexpected. In other words, Release is a very good movie."
2,boring,"i was bored to tears watching this movie, and I'm not really sure why I even watched it till the end other than I bought it! The characters weren't attractive at all, and the casting should have been better, no priest has a porn star tattoo on his body, which they displayed numerous times. So no good story, no eye candy, and no pencil to poke in your eye while you were watching it. Lame movie all around."
5,Fun,This is a wonderful CD to use in the classroom. My only complaint is that it does not come in a CD case but a cardboard one.
4,All fogged up,"The Chauvet FX-800 is a very capable value priced fog machine. I have used other ""inexpensive"" 400 Watt foggers before and was terribly disappointed. For just a few dollars more however, the 700 Watt heater in the FX-800 does a great job of pumping out sufficient fog to fill a small to medium sized room quickly. My only complaint was that it did not include a bottle of fog juice right out of the box, so I had to make a special trip just to get some. All in all though, I think it is a great value for adding special effects to your light show or Halloween party."
1,A Used Product ?,I openned the box and found the product had been used and fluid was leaking form it. Plans had to be changed for a fogging maching in a small show due to this mal-functioning... used item (ordered as new).
1,Works for one season.,"I bought one of these 2 years ago, and it stopped working after 1 day. Tried to contact the distributor in FL, and after a few weeks they just shipped me another one. (Made in China, so I guess they don't know how to service them.)New one worked fine. Cleaned it per the instructions after halloween. Pulled it out this year and it doesn't work. It's clogged. Don't waste your money on this company. Pay less for a cheap one and buy two."
1,Do not purchase this machine,Purchased a year ago. Quite working after 2 hours. Ran cleaning fluid through it. Did all the maintenance that was outline in the pitiful little manual it came with - nothing. Web site has no help on it. Dealer in IL did not respond. Buy something else.
5,awsome,"this is the perfet accessory for the haunted attic you have. it is also useful in the room, den, or anywhere you want to make look cool. this can also be used for practical jokes, such as placing under the hood of a friend's car, jusst to give them a scare. the only downside to this is that the fluid you needs costs money"
5,Must buy two,"The Beautyrest Cotton Top Waterproof Mattress Pad is everything it claimed to be. It's soft, breathable and no worries about having a vinyl piece to tear on your waterproof mattress pad. Because it is somewhat pricey, I initially ordered one for my three year old daughter. I soon realized that because it's so plush, washing and drying took too much time And, I needed a back-up to accommodate nap time or bed time. The full-size mattress pad takes up almost all of the space in my 17.6 lb load capacity washer. For that reason, I'm glad I did not need a queen or king size mattress pad. But, the quality and comfort seem great and I believe this mattress pad will last for many years."
2,Way Too Basic,"It scares me that developers who are now ""certified"" needed to review more than 10% of the information in this book. It also scares me that 2 out of 3 developers fail the test the first time they take it, especially if this book covers the same subject matter. Secondly, did anyone have any trouble identifying the chapters written by one Emily Kim? If so, here's a hint: Every time she offers an example of how to set a variable, or how to process a form (really high level stuff), she uses her own name in the example. Emily appears to want all CF developers to know her name. It must appear more than a hundred times. I'll bet any amount of money she's got her own name on her license plate."
5,Not just for training exam - Very thorough review of CF,"Disclaimer: My brother is one of the co-authors. Having said that, I can also say that I've been developing with CF for four years, and have read most of the books on the topic.I don't have a need for the exam .. nor do I ever intend to take it, but I found this book to be a very thorough, detailed review of ColdFusion. It is certainly not a beginner's guide, as some familiarity with CF is assumed, but it gives better insight into advanced functions of CF (Structures, Associative arrays, etc) than I've read elsewhere, and differences between versions of CF (4.0, 4.5, 4.5.1) are better documented than in Allaire's own documentation.This book is therefore for the intermediate to advanced CF programmer who is looking to build a deep, complete understanding of ColdFusion beyond the tutorial level of many of Ben Forta's other books."
1,This is the WORST,"This is the worst product I can ever recall purchasing (and I am not limiting myself to computer related purchases).I have a 650 Mhz Pentium 3-based laptop and I have never seen software do to a computer what this did to mine. It continually crashed my system again...and again...and again. Each time I had to let my laptop's battery completely discharge. Then I would reboot the system before I could gain any measure of control over it. Why did I keep trying? I guess I must like pain; I didn't realize it until now, but I must.END"
5,the best record not to get played,this is probable one of the best records released by a upcomeing star. it is a great tragedy that she has passed away and the sound of her voice is only captured on two cds
5,A very special CD,Listening to this CD is so bittersweet. Knowing that Amie never had a chance to see it released or have a hand in choosing exactly which songs would be on it makes you treasure what she left behind even more. I'm only hoping that the other songs that didn't get put on this CD will someday find their way on a third Amie Comeaux album. She deserves it and so do we for her voice is truly that of one very special angel. I also very highly recommend her first album Moving Out. Its become one of my favorite CD's. Rest in Peace Amie.
1,"Sorry, this item is not worth the purchase price!","Unraveling The Inner Game To Slightly Used Cars Sales Success OnlineI purchased this about 3 months ago but didn't get around to listening until today. The CD has nothing to do with the used car business; it is a recording of a telephone interview which discusses motivational techniques for all business. The title is less than honest but is only slightly justified by the instruction to go to a certain website for more about the used car business, but that information is kindergarten level stuff which can be obtained free on most any online search engine. If you need motivation buy good motivational books available most anywhere and if you need help in used car sales this will not help you."
5,Another great book from one of romance's finest writers,"Laura Kinsale continues her tradition of writing romance with unusual settings, flawed characters you want to root for, and a beautiful, unique style. The plot revolves around a search through the desert for a mythical mare known as the String of Pearls. Arden Winter never suspects that the Bedu boy acting as his guide is in fact a girl of English parentage desperate to return to the homeland she's never visited. The two at first seem like opposites. She grew up in the wilderness, but longs for the security of England. He grew up under the constraints of an English gentleman's upbringing, but wanted adventure and danger. It turns out, though, that they have more in common than they first suspect. Kinsale is the best at creating tortured characters whom you desperately want to find happiness, and then making you doubt that they will, not an easy thing to do in a genre novel. This one is one of my favorites of her work."
5,Loved this book,"I could not stop reading this book. I was a little reluctant to read this because of some reviews but I am so glad I did. Laura Kinsale is just an incredible writer. Both characters, Arden and Zenia, were so well thought out and totally convincing. I am amazed that anyone would give this a bad review. Wow...I can't wait to read her other books.."
3,Horrible heroine,The story was good. Lord Winter had a great personality and was easily likeable. Zenia was the most annoying character I've ever had a misfortune of reading about. I really enjoyed the first part of the book but couldn't finish the second part because of Zenia's constant nagging and complaining.
3,This was a very different story....,"Another tortured hero but for a different reason and in a very different locale. I liked Selim but never could abide the wishy-washy Zenobia. Trying so hard to be an English lady but still thinking by the Bedu.laws. I still prefer a heroine with a backbone that can speak up and not hide behind assumptions that are usually, if not always, wrong. Like Arden, I was always looking for Selim to find her way out of the awful creature she allowed his Mother to create"
2,abusive love story......,"this was my first book by this author. First, let me preface my review with the acknowledgment that the author has obvious talent.I actually enjoyed this book immensely for the first 150-200 pages. Then the author took a 360 degree turn with the characters and storyline. This is one of those ""old school"" romances where the hero/heroine ""hate"" each other and spend the last 150 pages running away from each other, yelling, basically treating each other like dirt.While this may be the makings of a great ""woman's fiction"" type book. In NO way is this book a romance. Conflict I can live with-these two characters were nothing but downright abusive to each other, as well as putting their daughter in the middle of their madness. The ""real"" world is filled with enough destruction-this is not what I read romance for.2 stars for the first half of the book."
3,Hero great - Heroine unlikeable,"Unfortunately, The Dream Hunter did not live up to my expectations. The hero (Lord Winter) is a character you come to admire and respect. He has a lot of demons to work through, but has come to terms with his life and has stumbled upon what he has been searching for all his life. The heroine (Zenia) is a character I never came to like or even admire. She was cold and overly protective in every part of her life. I wondered why the hero even wanted to be with her sometimes. The story itself is interesting but it is the characters in the story that you want to feel compasion for. And for me it wasn't until the very last chapter that the heroine softened and found purpose."
5,Student Review from Ms. Gehrke's Class,"Welcome explorers! I really like the book, The Secrets of Droon,The Moon Dragon. Eric and his friends discover that their worst enemy, Sparr, turns into a little kid and joins Eric's team. The moon dragon, an enemy of Eric wants a powerful object called the pearl sea. If he has this object he will be able to destroy anything! Will Eric and his friends be able stop Sparr? Find out in this book!I like this book because the book is cool. The author puts in very imaginative creatures. I also like this book because the writer explains the characters in the book in great detail. I hope you like this book as much as I do!"
4,Tipsy,"Alan shares (for a high, but worthwhile price) insightful bench tips for us to enjoy. Easy reading in small bites. Thanks for passing these along!"
1,I can't believe I wasted over $40! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!,This book is TERRIBLY overpriced for a thin paperback of obvious ramblings. At $9.95 the book would be pushing the envelope.
4,An excellent studio reference,"Alan's latest book is a nicely illustrated collection of useful tidbits. Each page contains an illustrated tip that will be a help to the jeweler or metalsmith. One of the best things about the book is the way it shows ""thinking outside of the box"" solutions to problems encountered day to day in the studio. It is a good companion to his other technical books Professional Goldsmithing and Ring Repair. No bench jeweler should be without all three."
3,101 Bench Tips for Jewelers,"Rather overpriced for the amount of information in the book. The last twelve pages are simply advertisements. I have another book of Revere's, a very good one, and expected much more from him when I saw that he had written this one. I was quite disappointed in this book at this price."
2,Not so good as I taught,I have done jewelry works for 25 years and been a teacher for 17 years. I waited this book could give me some helpful tips but I knew them all and have used them for years. But this might be useful for the beginners. The pictures and the text is good. (my English is not very good)
5,I love this book!!!,"This is a fantastic book! Full of all sorts of ideas for organizing your bench, soldering, cutting, mounting, etc. Using nickles as soldering supports is now my standard method! Thank you Alan Revere! E. Macnish"
3,"OK, could be better","The author uses non standatrd notation for mathematical concepts, which isn't that bad but is VERY annoying. The coding style is not easy to read. As my knowledge of the field increases, i find this book less and less useful. I wouldn't reccomend it to any one familiar with the field, but for some one who is starting out, it can be an Ok introduction. The book won't have much of a shelf life."
3,Meat sticks,"Tried it once so far and the meat stuck so badly, that I ended up just rolling them in my hand instead. I'll try it again sometime, maybe it was a fluke, but was very discouraged. Wanted something to make them more compact so they weren't apt to fall apart."
2,Hurts my fingers,"Not alot to say about this. Aside from it makes a nice size sphere, it's alot of work using this to make a meatball because pinching a clump of ground beef into the baller is like using a pair of rusy scissors and my thumb gets abused with each one, and it doesn't release the ""ball"" easily. I would recommend an ice cream scoop before buying one of these."
3,It's a little big and feels cheap,"Granted, I only paid maybe $7 for it, but still, it feels a little cheaply made, like it will rust as soon as I wash it. Plus the fulcrum point is a bit loose. Also didn't expect the cups to be quite as big as they are. It'll work fine for my purposes but still."
3,Bigger than I thought,"I purchased this item based on other reviews saying that it's perfect for cake pops. It would make very big cake pops, probably double the size of a normal one. I don't recommend for cake pops.I will still keep to make meatballs. It's the perfect size for bocconcini stuffed meatballs. The design seems sturdy though I haven't used them yet."
2,Looks better than it works,"Not a bad idea: two hemispheres grab enough mix to form a meatball.Problem: if the meatball mixture is really good (like from Cooks' Illustrated) the mix is sticky--and the two halves don't let go. Even with timely dipping in water or whatever.We found a medium ice cream/cookie scoop (e.g.,OXO Good Grips Medium Cookie Scoop) works better. The rotating bail inside the scoop forces the meatball out--even if the mix is sticky."
5,amazing item,This meatballer is amazing works like a charm. Made perfect shaped chicken meat balls the other day I'm in love
4,thanks!,"I bought this to make candy balls with it. It appears to be just what I was wanting, Thank you!"
2,Junk for the bottom drawer in the kitchen.,"A poorly designed and executed piece of junk.The thing cuts into your hands when squeezing the meatball or trying to scoop meat from the bowl. I used it once, put it in the bottm drawer (the place where useless junk accumulates) to be forgotten until the next trip to the recycling center."
2,Too big,"Bough this to make cakepops, but it makes waaaay too big balls for that. My mistake probably. Should had searched for size and all."
3,Not bad,Okay but meatballs don't come out well after the first couple. I tried spraying with Pam but that just made them greasy
4,Great for making uniform size meatballs,"As other reviewers suggested, I kept a glass of cold water handy and dipped the meat baller in it between each meatball I made. It also helps to make sure your meat is very cold. I deducted a star since it seemed I still needed to finish rolling each meatball by hand to make sure it held together. Other than that, great product for uniformity!"
5,M is for Marvelous!,"This book will be great for my pre school classroom, I'm always looking for new ways to encourage manners and the drawings are so cute and detailed! I know my students will want this book read again and again! Can't wait to see your future books offered!"
3,Thank goodness for the fast forward button,"Midnight Sun is watchable and even enjoyable if you can fast foward through the boring lackluster dancing and the boring and weird acrylic wall dancing (WHAT IS THAT???). I really gave this a chance because it looked so innovative but after a while it become down right embarrasing.The aerial acts and wheel balancing were breathtaking and I loved the music and singing. I suspect that much of the uneveness of this production is that is was a one of a kind performance and not refined for touring. Some of it had a thrown together atmosphere. Also, it was certainly much more fun to be there in the audience.An uneven but interesting show worth a look as long as you are not expecting another Varekai."
3,cirque du soleil jazz festival,"This was part of the Montreal Jazz festival.Not much cirque on this dvd, and not one of my favorites, more music but remember this was done outside, and there was not much else you can do at a jazz festival .So if your looking more for cirque get one of the other dvds."
5,Alegria - The Midnight Sun - Cirque De Soleil,"I am sorry to say that this DVD was worth the purchase and I am glad that I bought it. Francesca Gagnon did a super performance with ""Alegria"". I understand that during this production, this was the final appearance that Francesca preformed ""Alegria"". She did a sweet job and this video in my opinion is worth the money. If you are musically inclined and open to different music, you will appreciate this DVD. Francesca stole this show away with her final performance. Now that was totally worth buying the DVD."
3,Not the worse show I seen,This DVD had some good parts. The music was great. The costumes were awful. They had some good singers and a great acrobat that went around in a round thing. Then they had a very good act seen in the Barnom and Baley Circus. They also had a good act with some statues and a good act with some one in a fish tank. Now was the DVD great no it was not it needed a lot more great acts. But it had a few very good acts. It is a nice addition to the series which comes with 11 other DVD for 130.00 on Amazon. But out of the set of 12 DVD's I only seen one worse DVD than this one. So if you did not get it with the set don't spend 18.00 to buy it on your own.
5,EXELENTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"No puede haber un concierto mejor que este !!!!!gracias a la participacion de las cantantes oficiales de Mystere , saltimbanco , quidam, varekai y alegria , Midnight sun se vuelve una experiencia inolvidable.ES ALTAMENTE RECOMENDABLE PARA LOS FANS DEL CIRQUE DU SOLEIL."
2,Not so great of a product,If I didn't already have one of these that works I would have only given it one star since zero is not an option. This one was dead on arrival so I sent it back for a replacement. I've noticed others have had these arrive DOA too. The one that I have that works seems to work ok but I haven't had it very long.I would suggest installing it in a sheltered location as they are not really weather proof and if it gets wet inside it probably won't last long. The weather proofing in these units is very unusual to say the least and it does not work on mine because the cheap case does not meet the rubber bead on the inside of the opposing case. I sealed mine with a removable mastic tape to ensure that the internal components stay as dry as possible.
3,CDRW External Drive Not On Par With Internal Drive,"My IBM ThinkPad doesn't have an internal drive so I bought this thinking I could reload the operating system. The BIOS didn't recognize the existence of this external USB drive until AFTER the machine booted into the defective OS. At that point it was too late. I really need a native CD drive for my ThinkPad. However, this drive is OK if you need it for loading and running other applications or something."
4,Small but Meaty Book on Early English Beliefs,"This short (36 pages plus notes and supplementary material) book is actually a transcript of a talk by Kathleen Herbert. A lot is packed into these pages. There are snippets from source material (with translations as needed, e.g, from Old English) as well as Herbert's observations and conclusions about the religious beliefs and practices of our Anglo-Saxon ancestors. Herbert touches on the gods, the runes, the calendar (seasons and festivals of the year), and more. Statements about what people thought during a period in which written evidence is relatively sparse are of course always somewhat tentative, but Herbert makes good cases for her conclusions."
2,"Whose ""lost gods""?","This book is only about the lost gods of 'old England,' but apparantly the gods of pre-Saxon Britain don't count, even if a good deal of the lore on them is gone, too.By the way, did you know that the word ""Welsh"" comes from a Saxon word for ""foreigner""? It's what the Saxons called the natives whom they pushed westward..."
3,Good information but with a politically correct bias,"The Indian Mutiny first became the ""Great Sepoy Rebellion"" now it becomes the ""1857-58 Indian Freedom Movement"". The Indian Mutiny was correctly titled at the time. It was a mutiny and India did not then exist. It is unfortunate to see the revisionist PC view of history intruding."
3,Slippery when wet,"These sound quite a bit different out of the box than un-coated strings, as if they've already been broken in with a warmer, lower tone, compared to un-coated strings. For me, the sound is a little too dull but others may prefer it. Also the coating on these seems pretty thick and I found them slippery when playing, particularly in the first couple weeks, and especially if you perspire. The only other coated strings I've tried are EXP and I prefer their sound and feel to these."
5,gorgeous story that comes full circle,"Absolutely beautiful story of people who lose each other and the heartbreaking, vulnerable steps taken to find each other again.I found that real emotion pored out of this book of real people, people with flaws, people who can't say the words that they know others need to hear. So much of the style reminded me of Alice Hoffman's books. An absolute beautiful story that I won't tire of reading."
5,Bought for my Mom,"Love the color, sturdiness and the multiple height adjustment options. For a less expensive product, this was very good quality. Mainly though, my Mom loved it."
3,splash cane,"this adjustable cane is fine and I like the design. However, I thought it was one of the folding kind. That's my mistake--it's described correctly on the website--but I was still disappointed. I read ""adjustable"" as folding, and I know they are not the same!"
5,A Must See,"This fascinating film would be of interest to anyone in the military, anyone in law enforcement, any history buff, or anyone intent on learning more about Saddam Hussein and his fall from power. It's a relatively short film, one that could easily be shown in a class or watched over and over to get the full impact. One tidbit that I especially enjoyed was learning that Saddam Hussein's favorite Hollywood movie was The Godfather. His family truly was one big crime family, and there are still some of his family at large."
4,"Not great, but still OK","These are good exercises, sort of intermediate level, quite old fashioned and a bit boring. Good part is that her cueing, explaining the form and counting is good. I also like some of the moves, a small difference in position from the usual one makes a big difference in how it works. I guess I'll keep using this from time to time, but not on a regular basis. It just isn't a fun workout where you actually have to struggle to keep up."
3,Buns of Steel collection,"I was actually looking for the aerobic work out ""Buns of Steel 2000"". I had them when they were first sold in three vhs videos. This is just the workouts for the actual ""spots"" (abs, arms, butt). They are good exercises, but I wanted the aerobic part of it."
5,OLD classic VHS programs now on DVD,"Tamilee of present day provides an introduction but the exercise programs are from approx 1992-1994. All the exercises are still valid and great, afterall a bicep curl has not changed over time! So rather than redo everything, these DVD's are basically copies of the old VHS tapes. Three in one though - so the price is actually great. If you've never worked out with Tamilee - now is your chance. These programs may be old and her outfits a little dated - but they are still totally effective and easy to follow. Highly recommend."
5,Gave as a Gift,"I gave this as a gift, so I don't have much to say, other than I have heard no complaints, so I assume it functioned well."
4,Classic Buns of Steel,"This is a good ""classic"" workout. I like Tamilee's style. The quality of the picture us a bit grainy, but it doesn't detract from the workout."
1,Too pricy !!!,Way over priced even for a discontinued item ... Its dumb of them to discontinue just the second box ... Ridiculous...
3,"Good release, but don't pay the money for these.","I would not pay the money for these Drgon Boxes, the picture quality compared to the blu-ray version is inferior in every way.Save yourself the money and headaches by trying to get this particular version of Dragonball Z and get the much chaeper Blu- Ray"
1,Horrible,"The american voice sound so cheesy and horrible. I would rather watch it japanese with subtitles but waite, it does have this feature. But it is only availbe mono or 2.0. While the english is in 5.0 how stupid is that."
1,Pointless review,"Too early for that cover art. No dub music and the japanese music is sooooo bland and makes the show boring. I will however get these dragoboxes just to have every dragonball dvd release ever. But for all you none smart people who think that dub will hurt the video quality are not, well, smart. It will hurt the quality when it is 4 or 5 tracks. Its not on there, because Funimaton is treating there anime now untouched. It's not because of the video quality they are not putting it on there. I can't believe how many stupid Dragon Ball Z fans are out there.Note: I'am fully aware that I'am going to get ambushed with negative comments. I just want you to know, I don't read them. So putting those comments are just as pointless as my review."
3,GOOD GAME,Keeping this review short and sweet. I dont personally believe that this was the best resident evil due to the fact that the monsters werent so creative which took the whole UNDEAD fealing away from the game. IT MADE ME FEEL MORE LIKE I WAS PLAYING METAL GEAR SOLID or something and not a survial horror. COULD HAVE DONE BETTER>
2,BAD controls,"This is my first RE game and i couldnt stand it after the first 15 minutes. The controls are really bad. This could be a good game if they fixed the controls, it makes it almost unplayable to me. Maybe after a while you can get used to it but it would still annoy the crap out of me. I'll stick to other games for now, maybe in RE5 they will make them better."
1,DO NOT buy the Playstation 2 version of Resident Evil 4!,"I'm still in shock that no one told me how inferior the PS2 version of Resident Evil 4 is compared to the GameCube and Wii. I knew from the Gamespot review that the graphics were not as good as the GameCube, but Greg Kasavin never mentioned in his review how bad the sound is! I own both the GameCube and the Wii version of this game, and I know from experience that one of the most terrifying aspects of this modern classic is its beautifully haunting Dolby digital sound. However the PS2 port is horribly inferior in this area. The sound is, to be completely frank, terrible! Imagine listening to this entire game through a MIDI sound file that you downloaded off of Limewire. That's what it sounds like. Do yourself a favor and go purchase a GameCube for $50.00 and Gamestop and then get this game. You won't regret it in the long run... I swear!"
1,5 stars? Are you kidding?,"This is, by far, the worst Resident Evil game in the series. Fighting a village full of crazies to save the president's daughter has WHAT, exactly, to do with zombies or survival horror? Fighting a big fish in a row boat? Yeah, that's real ""scary"". RE4 has managed to completely remove the horror element from ""survival horror"". And it's looking like it's going to be the same with RE5. Epic fail. Save your money or buy something from the Fatal Frame series."
5,Must buy even for newcomers,Even if your not a fan of horror genre this game is pure action start to finish. the ps2 version has extras that are well worth it playing again even if you've beaten the gamecube version. Its still a terrific game after four yours go get it you won't regret it.
5,IT IS THE GAME THAT GRAP YOUR LIFE,Resident evil 4 it is fantastic gamei will recommend people to buy it no matter what
5,This Game is Awesome!,"I bought this game as a gift for my son for Christmas. He's a teenager with lots of video game experience. He couldn't stop raving about how much he loved this game. I got a great deal and very fast delivery. Thanks for your help, Santa!"
5,ONE WORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love this game its so will detailed and they improve the camera and you can choose where to aim. This a must buy for all Survival/Horror or Action/Adventure or Shotter fans. Trust me you'll won't be disappointed at all. Will you might be if you lose your nerve 'cuase you might be that type of person who can't handle tense sequences on games probaly should rent it first to get a feel for it. But I strongly recomend buying this game. It only cost $19.99 on each system but the PS2 version has more bonuses than the GC version but the GC version is the best looking one. But their isn't a big difference graphic wise it's just minor things very small minor things. I hope you people find this review helpful.
3,Most overrated game of the generation,"Resident Evil 4 is fun for a couple of hours. However, after that, it quickly becomes mind-numbingly repetitive. What's worse, at least to me, is how much of a disgrace it is to the Resident Evil series. I truely feel that this game began its existance as a seperate game not related to Resident Evil at all. The few connections to the Resident Evil series seem very forced. This game also abandons the interesting genre of atmospheric survival horror to join the masses of generic shooter games. If you want a mindless shooter, RE4 might be for you. But if you want a true Resident Evil experience, I recommend the Resident Evil remake for the Gamecube. It's better in every way."
1,Piece of crap ! conrtol and Movement is Terrible !,I tried playing the PC version the controls were so F******* horrible you can hardly defend yourselfTried playing it on the PS2 ...SAME thing the controls and movement are just horrible for the game itself its just not horror to the fullest i played Resdient evil 2 now that was a GREAT GAME but this one sucks returned it already
5,The BEST PS2 Game Ever!,"Simply the best game for PS2 Ever. If you are a fan of the genre, you probably already have this. Fans of Madden etc. who have not tried this type of game, This will show how much more there is to gaming.This game is creepy, exciting, challenging and very rewarding. I can only play in 1-2 hour spells because I find myself actually shaking from the adreneline!Graphics, sound and story are all without equal on any system.You must buy this now!"
5,Great Fun!,"This game is one of the best I've ever played. The atmosphere is like no other game I've had the chance to play, and the story is really interesting. However, this game is not for the faint of heart, it is wicked scary and creepy. Lots of fun to play with surround sound in a dark room at night."
5,WOW!!!,"an excellent game, the BEST of the RE series, the new game play blew me away!!! Bottom line, a MUST have!!!"
5,Game Of The Year for 2006 hands down!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the absolute best game in the Resident Evil series. The new gameplay makes the game ten times better than the others in the series. The third person behind the back camera angle was an extremely nice and much needed touch. Another thing that also makes the gameplay better is actually being able to see where the heck you are shooting. There is also a map feature now that tells you where the heck you are supposed to go. Not only that but the graphics are outstanding! The voice actors/actoresses are incredible as well. You play as the stong and noble Leon and after beating his quest you can play as the mysterious and sexy Ada Wong! The best thing though is the storyline! I'm not going to ruin anything for you so just play this game and enjoy.
5,everything you can expect from resident evil.,"Although the controlls take some getting used to, the gameplay is great. the good things about this game are the interactive movies, which I believe to be a new legacy in video gaming. no holding back with your ammo, I hate it in games when you have to conserve ammo, when you beat the game, you get the chicago typewriter, (tommygun) with infinate ammo, blast away! the games puzzles are challenging, but very doable. the storyline is compelling, the characters are interesting, and overall, this is a bad-a** game. if you own a PS2, you must give this game a try."
2,This Game Is Not For Everyone!,"I was like you just a few weeks ago, reading the stirring reviews, seeing the critics rave about how AMAZING this game is, friends of mine talked about it, people telling me, GO GET IT!So finnaly I did, I spent 30$ in the gamestore, brought it home, eagerly popped it into my ps2, hands trembling I could hardly wait to play it!BUT ALAS!The controls, so choppy! It's nearly impossible to fend of the attacks of just 2-3 monsters! Not to mention you run about as fast as a snail with polio.The game looks impressive, beautiful graphics, intriguing story, creepy moments. But to me, the actual gameplay is just as important! I wasn't expecting it to be a devil may cry type battle system, but at least you should be able to MOVE while your aiming your gun!Everything ELSE about this game is just as your friends are telling you, amazing, but if your like me, and the gameplay and controls are just as important, this may not be the game of choice."
4,Decent Game,"I heard alot of positive things about this game, so I finally decided to give it a go. I was previously used to the RE5 system of combat, so the combat in this game came to me as no surprise, to my disappointment. I remember the old system, where you could control the character as a tank, and that was preferable for me. I didn't really take the time to play the game too much, but it has alot of ""run in and kill everyone in sight"" points in the plot, and it gets quite dull. In the old games there were usually no such things. It was ""who, whoa, try to just survive"" moments. This game is more of an action game than a survival game. I don't personally like it too much, but that isn't to say it's a bad game. I'd recommend at least trying it out."
5,A marvelous transition from 'Resident Evil 3' system on PS1 to a whole new and improved system on PS2,"This part of 'Resident Evil' video game series is indeed a marvelous transition from the RE3 system on PS1 to a whole new and improved system on PS2.You get to play as Leon S. Kennedy once again since RE2 on PS1, save the president's daughter, protect her, and most importantly... try to survive the whole story!This game also contains two additional playable modes that you play as Ada Wong, and a new and improved 'Mercenaries' mode with alot of characters to play with.This game is simply awesome and amazing, I recommend it for all RE players."
5,My fav game of the RE series,"I have only played this game on the PC version, but I loved it enough to get it on PS2. I enjoyed the game overall except for a couple of pizzles you need to solve to continue to the next area. The graphics on the PC version were awesome and I can't wait to see how the game looks on my PS2. I just ordered my PS2 copy today and can't wait for it to arrive. I recommend this game to any fans of the Resident Evil series."
5,Resident Evil 4,"The game is all it was touted to be, and different than some of its predecessors. I still haven't finished it, but then I take my time to finish a game, as I don't want to run through it and then have to buy another."
5,So much fun,"I don't have much to say that people haven't said already. So...I'll just say that this game is really, really fun! Even if you're not typically a fan of the horror game genre."
1,MAKES YOU DIZZY AND SICK PLAYING IT,THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE AFTER JUST 5 MINS PLAYING IT I HAD TO STOP CAUSE IT MADE ME FEEL SICK AND DIZZY FROM THE GAME PLAY MOVEMENT.EVEN MY GF WHO WAS WATCHING ME PLAY IT GOT SICK AND DIZZY FROM JUST WATCHING THE SCREEN.THE OTHER RESIDENT EVIL GAMES ARE JUST FINE I PLAYED THEM FOR HOURS AND NEVER ONCE GOT DIZZY OR FELT SICK FROM THEM.BUT THIS ONE IS LIKE MEDAL OF HONOR FOR ANY OF YOU WHO PLAYED MEDAL OF HONOR YOU KNOW WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT.IT MAKES YOU SICK AND DIZZY PLAYING IT.DON'T KNOW WHY THE MAKERS OF THIS GAME COULDN'T KEEP IT LIKE THE NEW AND IMPROVED RESIDENT EVIL FOR GAMECUBE.THE FACT THAT THIS GAMES MOVEMENT MAKES YOU SICK AND DIZZY MAKES THIS UNPLAYABLE AND THAT IS A MAJOR FLAW.
1,The worst mathematics book I have ever read!!!,"I gave this book one star only because I couldn't give it a score of zero!!! Although many professors say that this book is excellent, remember they are professors who already understand the material. This book shows no examples, and the examples that it does show end abruptly with comments such as ""all items are routine."" Routine!!! Please show me what to do so that I don't have to spend more money on a separate study guide. Aren't mathematics texts expensive enough? This book may be an excellent addition to a professors library but this book should never, ever be used as a primary text for students."
1,Does not fly at all,"This model plane does not fly. Its two propellers do not have enough power. We tried every possible way to fly it, including having it on full power, then hold it, run and throw it from a hill top. It simply falls to the ground."
1,This does not work.,This airplane is a disapointment. It's does not fly in any way. We tried several times according to instructions and the only thing it does is crash and crash and crash.What a waist of money. The worst of it is that this was a christmas gift to my son and imagine his face. :-( :-S
2,Armitron Watch,"I returned the watch. It is nice looking, I just didn't like the face because it was much smaller then I expected. I recommend if you're looking for a small face."
4,Nice look nice size,"Nice looking watch, second one I've own. We broke the crystle changing the battery which was very hard to get the back off and then back on."
5,Love This Watch!!,"This is my second one of the same design. I love it because you can dress it up or down. Simple, sleek yet sophisticated. Another added plus is it is great for small wrists so it fits perfectly since this is problematic for me with larger watches.The only reason I had to replace it is because I cracked the faceplate after buying a new battery trying to put the back on which was very difficult.For me, I agree with some of the other reviewers this watch looks better in person. As long as this Armitron watch is offered I will be a loyal owner."
5,Armitron Women's Watch,"The watch was actually even nicer looking than pictured online. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone in the market for a simple, yet elegant, watch."
4,Beautiful and Classy Looking!,"This watch looks much better in person than the online picture. It looks very classy! The face plate is small and dainty so if you have problems seeing small print, this may not be the watch for you. I would have given it five stars but the band is a little small. I was able to get it on using the very last hole! I ended up giving it to my niece who has a much smaller wrist than I do. She really really likes it! She has a couple of watches but wears this one everyday saying that it is her favorite!"
5,Want to keep it for myself,"This watch is more attractive in person than in the photo, in particular because the finish looks flat in the picture. The face is actually quite shiny plus the hands and the markers sparkle. I ordered this for a friend and will order another one for myself because it's so gorgeous."
1,A sad disappointment,"I liked the watch at first. It's pretty and it ran fine--for two months. Then it dropped dead.I had the battery checked, and that wasn't the problem. A watch ought to last longer than two months. Since I bought it from Amazon, there doesn't seem to be any way to exchange it for a model that actually works. (I checked.) I know that all products have lemons occasionally, but this has rather soured me on Armitron watches."
2,Great toy- buy somewhere else!,"THis is an excellent toy- I'm sure most children would enjoy it, but parents, buy it somewhere else. I read a review on here that said it was overpriced so I checked some retailers in my immediate area, and sure enough, this truck is half the price these sellers are charging, save the money, and buy your kids TWO toys from retailers that aren't trying to gouge you."
1,this is a new model,This is a newer model then the one as remember in childhood. The real classic tonka dump had a painted on ladder. This one doesn't. Toys made today are not like how they were made in the 70s or 80s.
4,Two different steel Tonka dump trucks,I'm seeing two different steel Tonka trucks out there: The one that TRU sells for around 20 dollars or so is the Tonka Steel Dump Truck - TS4000 (item no. 26670). The one listed here for purchase is the Tonka Classics Dump Truck (item no. 93918) that costs more here on Amazon. The Hasbro website says ''Approx. Retail: $14.99'' for the classic. It's a mystery to me how Amazon prices their merchandise.
1,Not the same item that was listed,This item was not the same item that was listed for sale. It was a much older GBC'd copy. I was very disappointed.
3,Not what I thought,"I got this in audio, thinking it was the book by the same title, that included stories by Kim Harrison - but this wasnt it.Still, it was a quick listen and the stories were interesting if not great. I had the feeling a few of them were true stories in the way A Million Little Pieces was a true story - maybe with a basis in fact, but not strictly speaking true."
2,Nothing new,"Poorly organized and difficult to read. The new edition adds more pages but no new information -- if anything, it's worse than the original. If you are looking to improve your performance, this book leaves a lot to be desired."
3,Good in a scholarly sort of way,Second book by this author with too much unimportant science and not enough plan. I don't care about atp. Just tell me how to win the western states 100.
5,A goldmine of information,"First of all let me say that this book is a member of the hypersonic suppository school of presentation. I wish those that attempt to learn the tetrad and Newman-Penrose methods from this book only good luck. That said, this book contains the most extensive treatment of black holes I have seen anywhere. Period. The section in this book on Kerr black holes inspired me to seek and find a physically meaningful interior solution for the Kerr black hole. I have to admit it: the tetrad and Newman-Penrose treatments inspired me to master these techniques. In the long run that is what this book has done - inspired me. Anything by S. Chandrasekhar does that to me."
4,The Truth is far more true than Fiction,"A commendable and hopefully second part of a trilogy - Nick are you listening - we need to find out what happened. In the style of Operation Thunder Child (Nick's first novel), I suspect there is far more truth in this volume than the fictional tag would suggest. A must for all UFOlogists. This story brings to life more intrigue than any official will admit to - Read it!"
1,Bigger than regular power supply - misleading marketing,"I bought this because I thought (from the picture) that it was a small, slim unit that held all of the power cords inside. Nope. Turns out the cord from the wall to the power converter, when wrapped up, is about as big as the power converter itself. Only the cord that plugs into the computer tucks inside the unit. Very dishonest marketing by Sony. The standard power supply is actually smaller and more portable than this thing, and it costs less. I will try to upload photos of this unit and the regular one. No complaints with Amazon, though. Naturally, this thing will be going straight back."
3,Better than the standard AC adapter,The cord is definitely shorter than the standard AC adapter and wraps around the unit easier. I expected it to be smaller and so much lighter but I guess it will do.
2,many details but not clearly arranged,"I am somewhat disappointed after reading almost all of the book. It contains a wealth of details and is sometimes very amusing to read. The author seems to know far more about the American colonies than most historians do.However, he presents it in a very confusing way. The clarity of the arrangement is mostly absent. It looks like he can't seperate major and minor facts and mentions a lot of details that are not relevant. I have read some books about the American colonies so I have some knowledge of them. Perhaps Andrews has written his book only for people who have read as many books as he probably has."
3,I don't have received anything. I am still waiting for the CD,I don't have received anything. I am still waiting for the CDPardon my english but I am french and I don't speak very well.So I am waiting.
1,Not so Healthy Halloween,"Stating that this book is appropriate for young children is complete misinformation. I was shocked and horrified at the message this book sends. The idea that over-exercising and starving oneself for 6 days in order to get in shape, then binging and gorging on a buffet does NOT promote a ""Healthy Halloween"" as the book's title suggests. Use it as an example of what not to do when teaching your kids healthy eating habits. Personally, I won't be buying this book for my kids."
1,Unappropriate,"This book is not age appropriate. It is about a witch who is too big for dresses so she goes to fat camp and loses weight to pig out so bad at the ""Halloween Ball"" that she rips her dress out. Completely disgusting and NOT appropriate!"
1,less than 1 star,"i don't own this camera. my friend does, but with my experience using it, it is horrible.first off, the screen is tiny.only 3x zoom! eek!! (my hp m407v is 18x)confusing feature wheel. at least my hp has buttons.expensiveconfusing menuno printer dock,yetrecharger that doesn't attach to camerawhy would you waste $250 on this piece of junk? at least get something a little bit worth the money, maybe not my hp, but something bettter than this camera for a five year old."
2,good camera but very short battery life,"This camera takes good pictures and is easy to use. It's sort of big and clunky compared to newer cameras. It's really easy to plug into the usb port and drag-and-drop your pictures onto your computer.My only complaint is that it goes through batteries ridiculously fast. This may just be a problem with my particular camera, and my camera is a few years old. I don't really use this camera very much, but it seems like almost every time I do, I have to change the batteries."
4,Quick service,"I damaged my S60 and needed a replacement. This fit the bill perfectly, both in cost and quick service. No problems with the camera."
2,Malfunctioned after a few hours!,"I just bought this Sony Cybershot DSC-S60 after reading many good reviews about it but after only a couple of hours of happily using it, it stopped working properly and became extremly glitchy. Every time I tried to power it up, the screen would come on but then it kept turning itself off (unless it was in review pictures mode). If I tried switching it to any other mode it would turn off again. I checked and tested the batteries and they're still full power. I'm returning this camera ASAP and going for the more reliable Canons which I've never had problems with in the past. Oh well, another disposal camera bites the dust!"
1,TERRIBLE BATTERY LIFE!,"I bought this camera today from Fry's because it was on sale. The battery life is HORRIBLE, it only lasts about 30 mins to an hour if you're lucky, I've gone through 16 AA batteries today. I'm going to see if the ""magical"" Sony batteries and charger kit are better. But it's already seeming like a money pit. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone, Sony's quality in products have dropped so much in the past years."
4,Very decent camera,"Positive:+ 4.1 Megapixels+ 3x Optical Zoom+ Crystal Clear Photos+ 2"" LCD+ Barely Any Shutter LagNegative:- Medicore Battery Life- Only 32MB Memory Stick IncludedCheck this one out, but you might just wnat to do some more browsing."
4,"Great Camera for vacations, weddings, family outings","The two things that prevented this camera from getting a 5 star rating are:1. The Sony Memory Stick prices.2. 3x optical (would have been nice with a 4x).I compared this camera to the Canon and Nikon 4.1MP and even the 5MP cameras, and purchased this camera instead. This camera edged out the Canon and Nikon comptetitors.1. More shots with 2 AA NiMH batteries (up to 500 shots in proper lighting). You are lucky if the Canon or Nikon gives you over 125 shots. There's no need to ever use an AC adaptor. Four fully charged NiMH AAs will give you 1000 shots.2. 32MB interal memory.3. Underwater case for snorkelling (under $90 for up to 9ft)4. 35mm Lens adapter with 30mm to 49 or 52mm ring adaptor and Polariser and (sepia filter for underwater pictures)under $60.5. Excellent sharp shots up to 8x10, Very Good at 11x14."
2,cute but too short,"I purchased this for my 34 month old son, who loves Sesame Street and books but quickly lost interest in this one. It is very short -- not enough detail to be helpful or engaging. I agree with other reviewers that Joanna Cole ""My Big Boy Potty"" is a much stronger choice -- that book was a big hit with my son and give a lot more helpful info for him about the potty training process."
3,Cute book,"My son seems to like this book as a book, not as a potty training incentive! He especially likes the page where the big box enters - he always guesses that it's a rocket ship, not a potty! Maybe as he gets a little older and closer to being fully potty trained, he'll get more out of it!"
1,The inside was upside down,"Honestly, no one opens a book for quality control? I have to turn book upside down and backwards to read to my 2 year old...SMH"
2,Too Short and not visual enough!,It's not worth your money. Poorly written. Looks that sales of it rely on the known character Erni. Good marketing.
1,Too Big For Diapers,"My grandaughter loves the book. She carries it with her everywhere, even to the potty. Very colorful; it holds her attention."
5,Too Big for the Book,"My very big boy thought he was too big to read the book, at first. Then he started agreeing with what the book was talking about. He has been trying to be a big boy for everything, except the potty. Now with the help of the book and Potty Power...he's got it!"
4,Cute and entertaining,"I got the feeling my son (2.5 yrs) could relate to Baby Ernie. The book addresses the subject of 'using the potty' rather succinctly and in terms that 2 year olds (and probably also 3 year olds) can relate to. The image of the baby crawling around with diapers works well, especially if there is a little sibling. I very much liked how it stressed that Ernie stops playing when he has to go pee/poo - this is usually our problem!Have fun!"
4,Daughter love to read this on the potty!,"Just begining to introduce potty training to my 2yo and she LOVES this book! From reading and looking at the pictures, she has finally made the association between diapers = baby and potty = big girl. This made a big difference in her desire to go to the potty!"
1,Why so many positive reviews?,The book is like 5 pages and doesn't have much content (as you may have guessed). Plus it shows Ernie wrapping himself up in toilet paper. Explain that to a toddler...
2,Not all that great,"I was disappointed in the story of the book. The book is very short and I felt that when my daughter and I read it, there was not much room for discussion. Ernie makes the transition from diapers to underwear seem a bit too easy. Other books do a better job highlighting that it takes practice and time. Ernie never has an accident or doesn't even seem to object to not wearing a diaper. My daughter doesn't seem to understand why all of a sudden we are trying to potty train her because things seem to be just fine to her!"
2,Could've been so much better,"Based on the age of most toddlers learning potty training, this book was a dissapointment. It's great that it's Sesame Street and the pictures are simple and colorful, but it's only a few pages. My son (22 months) is just started to get engaged in the concept, and about 4 pages later the books done. This book would be more appropriate for an infant in simplicity if the theme wasn't for potty training aged readers."
2,Unimpressed,I didn't find this very encouraging. The wording was unimpressive and the only draw was the baby Ernie.
2,ernie potty,"this is really basic but very cute,takes all of 20 seconds to read!Wished I'd bought it at a yard sale and not paid so much $"
3,Same text different book,"I have come to learn that most potty books are essentially the same. This one is no great exception to the potty book rule. One thing that is nice about it is that it specifically states that when he has to ""go"" Ernie stops playing and runs to the potty. That's an important message for toddlers. However, they also seem to avoid saying ""poop"" or ""pee"" which I think is a bit prudish for a book on pottying. Karen Katz has a nice potty book as well if you're interested."
3,Doesn't show Ernie on the potty,"My 17-month-old son enjoys this book, but it isn't great. It doesn't even show Ernie on the potty, and there are only two pictures that show the potty clearly. I'm now looking for a more helpful book for introducing the concept of using a potty."
4,"Good book, not great","I've purchased a lot of potty books and this one is just ok. My daughter enjoys the pictures. There's not much to read (which can be good), but the phrasing is a little...I'm not sure of the right word, maybe just different. I kind of throw in my own words on each page and my daughter seems to enjoy my version.My daughter has two other potty books she likes better: Tinkle, Tinkle, Little Tot and The Potty Book for Girls. Hope my review helps."
4,Board Book,Too Big for Diapers (Too Big Board Books)Ok book but could be more detailed-my grandson has very good comprehension and seemed bored with the book very quickly.
1,Horrible ending - Ernie TPs the bathroom,"I bought this book to help potty train my 2 year old son. The last page of the book completely ruins what would have been a useful tool. The text warns Ernie not to use too much toilet and there is a picture of Ernie and the whole bathroom covered in toilet paper. Not helpful, buy another book."
3,Too Big for Diapers,"I have no idea why anyone would give this book 5 stars. It is short and dull. It was not creative or fun to read, which I expect from children's book. However, my son has recently become attached to it and I think primarily from the picture that had Ernie playing with blocks, which my son can identify with. Skip this and find something more inventive or fun."
4,Guaranteed Hit,"Leave it to Sesame Street to produce a potty book that is as simple as 1-2-3. We loved the photos (instead of the usual drawings). Baby Ernie had some of the same toys we have - my daughter loved that! ""Don't use too much, Ernie!"" I often tell her when she rolls out too much toilet paper.We have read almost every potty book available on the market as of 9/2003 (over two dozen!). Most fit into two categories: INSTRUCTIONAL books that introduce the skills needed to master the potty; and those that are primarily ENTERTAINING, for children who understand what is supposed to happen on the potty, but need extra time to make it happen.I think Too Big For Diapers fits more in the ENTERTAINING category, although it includes washing hands with ""sudsy soap"" - a step many potty books omit. Worth the money."
2,"Cute, but Not Helpful","This book covered only the real basics to help your child understanding potty training. There were cute photos of baby Sesame Street characters, but just not enough educational substance to make it worthwhile.For some real help with training, I highly recomment ""My Big Boy Potty"" or ""My Big Girl Potty"" by Joanna Cole instead. While our son asked to read that book every day, he quickly became bored with ""Too Big for Diapers"" and soon forgot all about it."
5,Perfect for the Sesame Street character lover,"My 21-month-old really loves this book. She is not yet trained, but this book was a great help in introducing her to the new plastic potty that appeared in our bathroom. Right off the bat she figured out that only babies wear diapers (like Baby Ernie). And she seems to relate to what Ernie is going through, playing with his blocks, taking off his pants, sitting on the potty. I would recommend this for kids who like Sesame Street. Bert's in it, too."
2,too young,"This book is way to imature for a child that is old enough to be learning to use the potty. It is a good book if you want to start exposing your child at around 12 months, but does not speak to the level of a 2.5 year old."
4,Too Big for Diapers,This is a fun book for toddlers with recognizable and lovable characters. It keeps their attention span as it is short and to the point.
3,Fast and to the Point,Daughter was into this for a week and wanted to be like baby Ernie but it was a fastly passing stage.
2,"Cute, but that;'s all","My son likes this because he likes Ernie, of course. But out of the 4 or 5 potty books he has, this is the least useful as a teaching tool. I would highly recommend Once Upon a Potty as well as Karen Katz' A Potty for Me."
5,Helpful,This was a good potty training aid. It helped to peak my son's interest about using the potty when we were potty training him.
4,toddler likes it,bought this book for my elmo loving toddler and le loves it we even went out and he picked out an elmo potty
5,Perfect for potty trainers that love sesame street.,"Ernie is a big boy now, too big to be wearing diapers like a baby. Whenever I turn the page to the unwrapped present that's a potty, my son says, ""It's a potty! Just like my potty!"" He loves Sesame Street and its helpful to remind him that, just like Ernie, you have to stop playing and run to the potty when you feel like you need to make pee-pee. This has really helped alleviate the accidents in a very short time."
3,Inexpensive Potty Book,"I bought this book in preparation of my son (23 months) starting to potty train. The book is short and simple, about what I would expect for this price. If I could do it over again I would probably spend the extra couple of dollars and get a different book. As for my son he memorized the story quickly and seemed to enjoy it."
3,Good for Introducing Potty Training but Not for Older Kids,"I bought this for my 28-month-old daughter because she loves Sesame Street and I thought it might help inspire her potty training. Unfortunately, she's a bit too old for it. It's a very basic and introductory book with few words and pages. It would've been good for her when she was around 18-20 months to help introduce the idea of potty training, but it's too babyish to inspire her continued efforts as an older toddler. She just isn't that interested in it."
5,Very Good Book,"My 2 year old loves this book. She sits on her potty and has me read it over and over. I can get her to try to use the potty just by bringing up the ""Ernie Book"". Very good book."
3,not much to it,"This book requires a good amount of parental embellishment to fill in all the blanks the books leaves re: learning to use the ""potty."" It has great potential, but doesn't quite go far enough (it is very short). I give it 3 stars because it's Sesame so most kids will like seeing the characters & it's a good jumping off point anyway. Like most of these books, it stresses use of a separate potty chair rather than a potty insert on the adult toilet (see the Dora the Explorer Potty book with flushing sound button for a good alternative)."
5,Sesame Street fans,"My son loves Sesame Street - so I had to buy him this book. It's a short book but simple and effective. He really likes it and even has read it in bed. He learned to use the potty at a later age than most kids, so this book just shows him that he is ""Too Big for Diapers""."
4,Too Big for Diapers was a good support book for potty training!,This book kept my 2 year old interested in potty training. She enjoyed the book for about a week - now she is a BIG GIRL!
3,Less than expected,"Can't complaint about the graphic design of this book, it's colorful and really attractive. But in terms of actual content I was a little disappointed.Considering that most parents will think about getting a book like this only if they feel that their toddler is too big for diapers and needs some extra help to become fully potty trained, in other words, is older than 2 and a half years old, the story line of this book is extremely plain and simple, maybe suitable for babies that are only 2 years old or even a little younger.My 30 months old boy has shown virtually no interest in this book, and I feel he gets bored with it since he is already used to other stories, more complex than this one."
2,"flimsy, not informative","First off, the board book pages are thiner than most board books. I have little boys and they're really hard on stuff. We had this book for 2 weeks before the pages got bent in half.Second, I didnt like the fact that ernie used WAY to much toilet paper. The day after we read this book I found my bathroom covered in toilet paper. Yeah the probably would have done that anyway, but the book didnt help the situiation. Not a huge fan of the new Sesame Street."
3,"Not the best book out there, but not really bad, either","This book is not too bad, if you are just looking for something for your little one to read that is in the ""toilet-learing"" theme. However, this book doesn't really give much help in that direction, and has one problem (according to me). The page with Ernie wrapped up in toilet paper just doesn't seem to me to be helpful, and I wish my son had never seen it. He's always been fascinated with the roll of paper in the bathroom, and now here is Ernie smiling at him with paper strewn all over. Not a great message, but we talk about this not being the thing to do, so it isn't too bad, either. (The text on that page says, ""Don't use too much [paper], Ernie"". The book isn't advocating that behavior, but the picture is not a helpful one.)I would recommend ""Sesame Beginnings: Potty Time!"" over this book."
4,Great book,"My 18 month-old daughter enjoys this book. She loves Ernie. We haven't yet embarked on potty training, but we recently introduced the potty to her. This book will help."
3,"Cute, but not very long or helpful","My daughter loves Sesame Street, so the book was a hit with her, but it is very short and shouldn't be considered much of a teaching tool. Overall, cute but not very helpful."
4,A Good First Step,My granddaughter loves Sesame Street characters. We wanted to start a dialogue about toilet training.We have a Sesame Street potty chair and this book is a good selection towards the big event. The book was durable and colorful. We thought the book would be good reading material for the bathroom.
4,great texas blues,"the cd just picks up right from her last one tales from the austin motel,the title track loves the game is a rockin blues tune to the great instrumental ""fired up"" with debbie and coco montoya ripping it up, jay giels appears on the cd with also duke robiilard who plays and produced the cd"
4,"Fusing tech, jazz & breaks","This is not an artist full length; it is a continuous mix by Planet-E label boss Carl Craig.The whole set is sufficiently diverse, with balanced doses of nu-breaks (LB, Marasma, Goo, Shinju Gumi), abstract jazz & brazilian flavours (Jimpster, Ultralights, Recloose) , and techhouse-orientated beats (R. Craig, John Arnold, LB). The most interesting tracks are 'The Future' by LB, an neo-electro take on Prince's track of the same name from the Batman OST, and 'Poly Bell' by Droid, a dark, pulsating drum'n bass/tech bybrid with a few nice jazzy moments. Almost all tracks share an experimental, underground, techy edge and, while not constructed strictly for the dancefloor, will keep your full attention from start to end. Music for mature beatheads..."
5,An ingenius introduction for children to Magritte,"Dinner with Magritte engages the reader at many levels. It is a visually stimulating book with a story that imagines a child's visit to his neighbor Magritte for dinner. Through the childs's eyes you are introduced to the strange & wonderful world of the artist. Many of the illustrations are variations on actual Magritte paintings delightfully interwoven into the plot of the story. You will recognize the bowler hat, blue sky with clouds and the walk through the woods from his actual works. I use the book as part of my volunteer artist awareness class. The book enchants the children from 1st grade through 6th. What a dissappointment to find it out of stock - I was going to buy two as gifts!"
5,Wonderful edition! Woderful book!,"I love these books. Overall, presents a summary of British main myths and legends. Really interesting, beautiful illustrations. Can't complain."
3,Pretty Easy Reading,"I've read a good chunk of this book during a B-school elective on non-market strategies, and found it imparted some valuable information. It's not very prescriptive if that's what you're looking for. But it made me feel like I got something out of the class despite an unstellar professor."
4,The book for dilettante readers,The author provided some good examples demonstrating a picture of business and its environment. People who have exposed to Industrial Organization (or at least some levels of application of game theory) will get bored of all arguments without mentioning anything about its quantitative aspect.
1,Completely Falsified Information,I ordered and paid for a hardcover book. I received a paperback in terrible condition that was NOT new. I would never buy from this seller again.
2,Just never got very interesting...,"I usually love her work, but this book never took off and the two main characters were highly annoying. Just eh...."
4,Good chick lit,"I thoroughly enjoyed Maxted's book. I found the plot to be refreshing. It relates to a lot of women of today.I was a little disappointed with the end - I wanted about 1 more chapter. I felt the next to last chapter did not give the reader enough.The book focuses on two sisters who are best friends, but they are torn apart for one reason - babies. You'll have to read the book to learn more."
2,Highly Derivative,"After reading ""Getting Over It,"" I was deeply impressed with Anna Maxted, and thought that her super-stardom in the literary world was assured. Here was a writer who could tackle emotional troubles (in the case of ""Getting Over It,"" a woman who cannot cope with her relationship with her father, and thus with her lover) with poignancy and humor; Ms. Maxted wrote so fluently as to seem effortlessly. After this sparkling debut, Anna Maxted has suffered from best-selling author syndrome: nothing to write about so write again that first best-selling novel. To say that ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" is a carbon copy of ""Getting Over It"" is to flatter it; it is a back carbon copy. The plot is trivial, and the writing, while fluent and polished, is sprawling and shallow. If readers have not done so already they must read ""Getting Over It,"" and be astonished at how such a talented and perceptive writer could become so careless and apathetic."
4,A Tale of Two Sisters,"Although i found this book to be slow in the beging, it got better and was realist, i have a sister and we both think of eachother the way the Charaters Cassie and Lizbit do.it is both a sad and funny book and my favortie part is when Lizbit gets her job at her magizine. (VERY FUNNY!) i love all of Anna Maxted's books and this one brings you in, although you have to keep reading it to really like it."
2,Lacking Maxted's Trademark Wit,"I was actually very disappointed with Maxted's most recent chick lit outing. Wit, humor and hilarious happenings are normally the cornerstones of Maxted's writing. Not only did I find the two main characters unsympathetic and difficult to care about, a plot obsessed with having or not having babies made for a dull read to say the least. Here's hoping she'll bring back some of the more spirited characters and occurrences in her next novel!"
2,Not the usual Anna Maxted style,"I have read every Anna Maxted book, and I must agree with prior reviewers who found this book quite a departure from her usual style. I found the plotline rather dry-it was all about baby obsession. I found it hard to believe that Lizbet went from being happily childfree to spiraling into a deep depression after a miscarriage. I am a happily childfree woman myself, and if I was to have a miscarriage, I'd be celebrating instead of being sad. Lizbet's character was ruined in this book, just like Gabby's on ""Desperate Housewives"" was with all of the baby nonsense. Childfree people are childfree, period. There is no all of a sudden loving babies and wanting to be pregnant."
1,The Art of Detection,"Very disappointing book I wouldn't have finished it if it hadn't cost so much. If I wanted to read about Sherlock Holmes I'd read Doyle's. The whole story line is dull including Kate, count how many times we're told she's going to read daughter Nora abedtime story. I'll be crossing Laurie King of my list of author's to read."
4,The Art of Detection,"This is a delightful Sherlock Holmes-centric story set in San Francisco. Ostensibly a Kate Martinelli tale, it's a real treat for Holmes fans to savour, especially those who have had any contact with the Baker Street Irregulars, the international tribe of Holmesians. The book's main characters actually seem not to know or care about the BSI, so the uninitiated can become familiarized with this diehard group of Holmes fanatics. An entire ""lost"" Holmes story is contained within the book. Loads of fun."
3,Snail's Pace,"This is the first Laurie King book I've read, and am looking forward to reading more of her books. However, this book, ""The Art of Detection"", moves much more slow than most of us, who are used to reading mysteries/legal thrillers, like. What made me purchase the book, besides being a mystery nut, was that it takes place in San Francisco, my favorite place. But, boy does it move S-L-O-W! And there's so much detail at times that one becomes bored. There were many times when I almost gave up on it, especially when trying to endure page after page of a manuscript the main character is reading. Totally tediuous, I wound up speed-reading most if that portion. The story is interesting - Sherlock Holmes is a fascinating character - but there's nothing that really grabs you and holds on. No defining moment really, until the murderer is caught, but even that is a let-down. I suppose if you're a Sherlock Holmes afficionado, you'd like this book."
3,"good simply because it's Laurie King, but not her best","I am a huge Laurie King fan. I think she is an excellent, clever and smart writer. Her books ""Folly"" and ""To Play the Fool"" are 2 of the best books I've ever read. (The former is not part of either the Mary Russell or Kate Martinelli mystery series, by the way.) I was quite intrigued at the prospect of ""The Art of Detection"" weaving the Russel and Martinelli series together. Although I still enjoyed the book, I was somewhat disappointed. Yes, it starts out a bit slow, but so do some of my other favorite books of all time (Wallace Stegner's ""Angle of Repose"", for example). I have to be honest and say that the increased focus in this book on Kate's personal life is distracting. I don't object to Kate being gay, and I'm fine with having bits and pieces of her personal life come up here and there, but there was too much of it here. Since I can't relate to this, it's not especially interesting or entertaining."
3,It gets better if you don't give up!,"Reading the first part of the book, I kept looking for other things to do, it was so boring with all that tedious talk about the gun implacements and the area where the victim's body was found. If you can get past that part, and ignore Kate's over-sweet domestic life, the story does pick up. The story in the middle, which may be a priceless manuscript by Conan Doyle, is the best part of the book."
3,disappointing,"After reading the Beekeepers Apprentice, I was eager to experience Laurie King's other works, but The Art of Detection was a big disappointment when I ""read"" it via an audio version. It started out slowly and with a vast mass of dull research material regarding San Francisco harbor fortifications and descriptions of the Sherlockian victim's home - the former was (as I feared) never very relevant to the story. While the story got going with the ""story within the story"" a possibly original Sherlock Holmes in SF mystery, the character of the rather unsympathetic and unimaginative protagonist Kate Martinelli, with her cloying personal life ultimately sunk this one. Im afraid this turned out in the end to be more of a piece of gay special pleading than an effective mystery. story."
3,Just an Average Read,"I've read several of Laurie King's books over the years. With the exception of A Grave Talent which was quite good, most of her books are just average, this one included. She is NOT a master of plotting. Her books meander here and there and eventually reach a conclusion that may be less than satisfying. So it is with The Art of Detection. The supporting characters are only vaguely drawn. Her protagonist, Kate Martinelli, is not that interesting. Now I'm a liberal Californian, but I could hardly stand to read one more line about the cultural rainbow of San Francisco, and all the OVERT EXAMPLES of what constitutes a ""family"" there. All right already. We get it. King's books are not terrible, just way back in the middle of the pack of mystery writers."
2,Why the broken print?,"I very much like most of Laurie King's books, but this one I found slow and a bit dull. The pace was not helped by the lengthy reproduction of a broken-typeface manuscript that consumed about 100 pages and was a bit difficult to read. Anyone over 40 would be well advised to look for a large-print version of the book."
1,I like this author but despised this book,"I read this book because I really enjoy the author's Mary Russell series. I always try different series by the same author realizing that at times I will be disappointed. This was one of these times, I simply could not finish this book. I didn't care about the characters, didn't need to know detailed information about San Francisco and simply didn't care for the entire concept. While I am looking forward to the author's next Mary Russell book, I will not be reading any more of this series."
2,"For those who don't like Sherlock Holmes, skip this mystery","I have really enjoyed the Kate Martinelli mysteries and was very anxious to read The Art of Detection. I am NOT a Sherlock Holmes fan and therefore, have never bothered to read Ms. King's Mary Russell series. Once I realized that this particular Kate series mystery had a Sherlock theme, I was disappointed since I thought there were probably many more adventures and crimes Kate could solve living in the Bay area that didn't require a Holmes theme. I trudged through most of the book since my interest wasn't really held but, I have made it through. For those who think they should read The Art of Detection just to make sure that they don't miss anything about the Kate-Lee relationship, don't worry. There's nothing new so, you can skip this mystery and hope that the author produces another Kate Martinelli book WITHOUT Holmes connections soon."
2,Slow and boring book,"I was looking forward to reading this book because I love mysteries and I enjoy Sherlock Holmes, but I was really disappointed by it. It started out interesting but slowed down really fast. The descriptions of San Francisco and the natural scenery just went on and on. I wish this author had been more concise and to-the-point in her writing; a good mystery should be fast-paced and exciting. Truth be told, I couldn't even finish this one, and I am usually very good about reading the whole book once I've started it. This one was just too boring, but I bet it could have been very good if it had had a faster, more exciting pace to it."
3,"Good story, clumsily executed","I've read all of King's books, and was surprised at the number of plot inconsistencies in this one (In the first few pages, Al both has and then never carries a watch, for example).A bigger problem is that King seemed to forget whether she was writing in 19th-century British English (Holmes' story) or 21st-century American English. I found this drastically detracted from my enjoyment of the book.If you're not sensitive to either of those particular things, then this is a great read--for those of you with a copy-writer's habit of noting word use (or those who pay a *lot* of attention to throwaway-line details), it will be a frustrating one. Good story flubbed in the telling."
2,Not the Best Laurie King ...,This is not my favorite Laurie King -- the ending is a bit strange and not in a way that leaves you wanting to understand the overall book better.
2,A Disappointing Read,"I am a fan of this author, and had read the 4 previous books in this series. I enjoyed them. However, this one left a lot to be desired. I found the 8 year jump (leaving a HUGE gap in the story time line) disconcerting. And the page after page after page of ""manuscript"" was dull. I will watch for the next book and hope that it is as good as the first 4."
1,The Game's A Bore,"Love the Mary Russell stories. Really like the Martinelli character. This book was an ill concieved blend of sorts, with Martinelli seeking resolution of the death of a Holmes' collector. Both the modern day mystery and the pastiche were slow and thin. The book itself is preachy, where it had no need to try so hard. The vignettes of Kate and Nora and Lee spoke more eloquently about acceptance than the rest of the tepid storylines. The mystery itself was no mystery. The pastiche was merely annoying. I just can't find a reason to recommend this book. A disappointment."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The acting is poor, the storyline is weak. There are much better movies out there that deal with the topic of gambling addiction."
1,WHAT THE CRAP...!,"I hope somebody from Motown is reading this...because you people SUCK! First off, i realize that most of the people passing for musicians & that stuff that's passing for music is all you've got on the new side, but why rehash this over & over & over? And what's worse, this is the same thing that was released in 2001 as ""the very best of..."" What the crap are you people trying to pull?"
1,MOTOWN! You're kidding right?,Why? when there are at least 10 such compilations out on the market today?
2,"""Got To Give It Up"" is incomplete!","I downloaded this album Saturday night (2/21/09) for the sole purpose of getting the long version of ""Got To Give It Up"" (disc 2 - track 11) which the site says is 11 minutes 52 seconds long. You cannot buy that track alone. After the download completed I noticed that the track was actually only 8 minutes long. It cut off the last few minutes which, in my opinion, are what make the song unique. The other songs appeared to be fine as I played the album. I wrote a letter to customer service and they quickly responded. I was given a full refund and they acknowledged the problem. I was told it would be fixed in the coming week.So, my low rating is not regarding the album. Its obviously a great album. Also, I'm not criticizing Amazon. I think they handled this extremely well (assuming the track does get fixed). What I'm saying is keep an eye out on this track."
4,a good introduction to the New Fan,while there are 99 of these floating around on Marvin Gaye you still can never knock them because there is someone out here who is just getting into His work. His voice was a timeless Instrument that touched many lives&still does.
1,Ear reciever to big,The design is hot but the ear reciever is to big for any persons ear which causes the bluetooth device to hang away from a person's face. My two other roomates and I tried everything including using the smaller ear adjustment piece to hold it closer to the face but the ear reciever is just way to big to fit in a person's ear. I wanted it so bad to :(.
3,"Is that a dagger in your ear, or are you happy to see me?","The product sound and functionality are great... practically all cel phones nowadays are bluetooth capable, so you probably won't use the adaptor. The headseat pairs fast and easily with devices (I've got mine paired to both my iPhone and bluetooth-capable ham radio tx).Light's too bright -- it'll light up a room in technicolor at night. It's a bit big, too, and sticks out a bit too far from your face. It seems to stay put pretty well, though, and is comfortable. It's hard to ignore this one, it's like Darth Vader stuck his lightsaber in your ear.Good sound, though; and reliable. It's goofy, but I still like it."
5,Great Battery!,Got the battery in a couple of weeks ago. Works great! Just remember not to let the charger remain on it for more than 24 hours.
1,no power wheels,"this replacement battery did not meet original battery standards. It's for an ATV. This battery limits rider to level and solid ground, not like the original. too many failsafes built in."
5,Great Product,"I received the battery and had it charged in 24 hours, has been working great since. My daughter and my boyfriends boys have rode the Power wheels Harley Davidson motorcycle for many of hours before it went dead. Charged it and its going strong. Very satisfied with this product."
1,Not Enthused,"This book really in my opinion is a bunch of BS. It is faith based so that means you have to be kind of a right wing Christian to even want to take interest in this. I found no inspiration here and thought that a lot of it was bull poo, like that paper you had to rewrite twenty times for your english final."
2,just ok,"For the price, the graphics quality is ok, this product was actually printed on some cheesy material, I would have preferred a metal material. You get what you pay for, I really wouldn't recommend this product. I wouldn't purchase this product again."
2,Teen Jailbird Costume,"This costume if for a teen that is like a size 0. It is really tiny. It shipped fast, but was really disappointed when my child couln't wear it after having her heart set on it."
4,Strong Story. Good Shock,"I loved it. Plain and simple. No, this isnt a big production. But good story and some strong acting carries the film. I'm from Chicago, so I have an affinity for this tale. They did it right. Not a gory slasher, but a tense, thoughtful, thriller. Couple of the smaller roles were inhabited by weak actors (background or one-liner characters) but not distracting enough to take me out of the story. Main actor may have been a bit mopey. But I think it worked. Definite recommend."
1,Mary's not happy with this movie...and neither am I!,"I kept watching hoping it would turn the corner... what a disappointment. Cheesy acting plus bad transitional filming make what could have been a good movie (I understand this is based on a true story/legend from the Chicago area) into a jumbled mess. The lead actor is so unsympathetic that I found myself hoping either he would really do himself in or Mary would have her revenge.Unless you're from Chicago and know the background of this story, you may enjoy it just for that reason. Otherwise, I'd pass on this stinker.Mary is coming after those who made this movie and she ISN'T happy!"
5,"Buy it, you'll want to see it over and over again!","I watched this movie last night: it's great! So great, I am going to order it today. The fast pace and good acting made the 90 minutes whiz by. I'm from Chicago's South Side, and like many children, was told the story of Resurrection Mary when I was just a child. Once, my Mom and a friend were walking past Resurrection Cemetery on Archer Road at night when frightened by something/someone; and my Mom is not easily scared. The use of the Willowbrook Ballroom (a lovely place I've been to several times) is a definite plus for Chicagoans, as is any local footage. This movie is a MUST for any ghost story fan, not just haunted Chicago enthusiasts."
5,GG at his golden stage,"This album contains some of GG's best music writing he's ever done. I always thought he was the best when he was with the Jabbers, and this CD has all of the Jabbers tunes you need. GG knows what he's doing when he wants to write a good song. It took me awhile to find this CD, but when you get it, it's all well worth it."
5,"If you LOVE freestyle, you have to see this film.","I have been looking for this on film for the past 5 years and finaly its on dvd, its an old 80s movie so its not the graeatest but if you are a freestyle fan like I am you have to OWN this DVD. AWSOME."
1,Horrible,The best part of the movie was only Iris Chacon. The rest of the characters in the film are annoying especially Marc Anthoney. I thought they were gonna show all the freestyle artists with their hits and the story line could of been better.
3,Pie pans,"The size of the pie pans were as I needed but since using them I have found that they rust in small spots in the bottom. This is not a problem for use, but it makes them hard to keep clean."
2,irritating noise,"This movie moves along at the pace of its characters in mid-summer Australian heat. In fact, the pace of the characters exemplifies the overall effect of this film: very slow in most spots, and a sprint or two yielding most of the action/significance of the story. Both the title and the use of ""noise"" in this film were not a convincing element of the plot, and some of the segments of the plot are choppy enough to leave me a bit disinterested in what's unfolding. All of the characters are handled unevenly, and some of them (Australian police) seem downright unbelievable. The movie had some effective moments, the outburst of the diabetic heroine confronting her stalker, and the theorizing of our policeman protagonist as to the nature of death, heaven, and hell. But overall for me this movie is woven together with some holes in the fabric and some knots in the thread."
2,"a lot of noise, but not much music","Slow going, this movie hardly managed to keep my attention. It plays a lot like a made-for-TV film. And yet, the movie contains a great monologue by its main character about what heaven and hell are and how it's the summation in our brain's reactions to our entire lives that determines the way we spend our eternity."
3,"Early, Sabbathy NWOBHM","This, being a live collection from the late 70's portion of their career, lacks in sound quality. But it should please fans of the first 2 albums of this Black Sabbath-inspired New Wave of British Heavy Metal group. And since their catalog of 4 studio and one other live album remains sadly in obscurity, (perhaps 1 or 2 available as Japanese imports) it's the only game in town unless you can track down the original vinyl platters. Recommended to fans of Black Sabbath (Tony Iommi himself produced their album ""Deleted"" and Sab keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was a sometime member) but those desiring more treble and more guts should seek out ""Stand Up And Fight"" (1980) and ""Against All Odds"" (1983), two full throttle, riff-bitten, NWOBHM classics that just beg for a domestic reissue."
2,OK Demo,"The demo looks ok, but you didn't see much of DS9 in it, and on Elite Force you get to be on a starship. If you want a really cool Star Trek game that actually has a good story to it play Elite Force."
4,The Fallen Rises up,"First off, this isn't just a good game, it's a good Star Trek game. I have to admit that my favorite is Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force, but isn't it everybody's? In The Fallen, the 3rd person is a little different, and drastically changes the feel of the game, but it is awesome when you can climb across ledges with your hands. The graphics are good for a older game, but the lip-sync is way off, if you care about those types of things. And by the way, it works (for me, anyway) on Windows Vista, and so I'm assuming it works on XP also, but don't take my word for it. The story is also very cool. I have played through it as Sisko and am almost done with Kira and Worf. This is an awesome game, and I would definitely recommend it to my friends (oh wait, I already have)."
4,Great Game....lukewarm ending,"Well, the game gets an A+ for playability and atmosphere...the graphics are superb and it's a pretty thrilling game.My only real complaint is the ending, which is kind of anti-climactic...maybe I'm too used to dramatic, epic endgames. It's not enough to not recommend the game -- I recommend it whole-heartedly. I was just hoping for an ending with a little more excitement."
4,Danny Kaye fan,"Danny Kaye's movies have been difficult to find, but worth the effort. He is so entertaining, in my opinion, and this is one of my favorites. The story lines in his movies are usually very similar, with different settings, but i still like them all!"
4,Mystery of the Remastered DVD,"I returned and ordered a replacement for this DVD because it would not play on my JVC player/recorder or my Dell computer. The replacement did not play, either. However, it played fine on my wife's computer and on other DVD players. Go figure."
2,a disappointment,"Although the performance sequences are sublime, there are far too few of them to make this DVD worth purchasing. This documentary provides only the sketchiest of biographical details, leaving the viewer with far more questions than answers about what made the famous Parisian singer's life so remarkable and yet so short. Skip this and go directly to the A&E Biography's show on Piaf."
1,For devoted fans only,"This DVD should be viewed by devoted fans only and preferably French speaking fans at that. The picture quality is extremely poor, the appearances of Piaf are cobbled together and the sound is atrocius. It's dedinitely not one for the average viewer!"
2,a disappointment,"Unfortunately there is nowhere near enough substance to this DVD. Edith Piaf gave a lot of televised interviews in her life, and only a few little tidbits are included here. Only the sketchiest, barest biographical details are included, leaving the viewer with far more questions than answers about why Edith Piaf's life was so remarkable and so short. The performance segments are very good, and for that alone I am glad I purchased this DVD, but if you are looking for something like an A&E Biography on the famous Parisian singer, this is definitely not for you."
2,Big dissappointment,"Essentially, the problem for me was that the dubbing was done so obtrusively and so poorly that it becomes painfully embarrassing to watch this DVD in English (which is the only option.)Subtitles would have done the trick nicely, enabling us to hear the people onscreen yet understand them. When Piaf talks, her voice is immediately paved over by the voice of non-actor reading a translation of Piaf's words.Beyond that, it seemed a bit ragtag as a documentary -- some interesting details, but it all feels rather like an inexpensively made TV special that makes do with whatever odds and ends are most readily available."
4,I found this documentary interesting.,"Mind you, I wouldn't call myself a ""die hard"" fan of Edith Piaf. I enjoy several of her more popular songs like ""La Vie En Rose"", ""Padam"" and ""Milord."" So I wasn't being very particular with watching this specific documentary. I didn't care about the techie stuff, I was too busy listening to the music. It has the mark of the 60s on it, so yeah, it a bit dated but it is what it is. I enjoyed the music and it was cool to see Edith in the films where she's enjoying herself with friends, and being interviewed about on various things. I thought her comment re: her personal and professional life was interesting. As for not being able to speak French, and complaining about dubbing, I think that's silly. I didn't think it was distracting at all. Ms. Piaf and most of her fans were French, so of course the show will be in French. We Americans can't expect everything to be tailored and suited just for us."
4,congo jewels,I listen to Congo music a lot. This has been a passion of mine for years. This CD has a collection of old gems that are very hard to find. I was very pleased to see some old OK Jazz songs that are no longer in print. I recommend this CD to any one really into old african music.
1,Welte-Mignon,I am very disapointed for this issue. Do not be fooled by the DDD label. The recording is more about the outdated machine Welte-Mignon tried to record Horowitz in 1926 and nothing about grand master Horowitz. I did not even finish listening any of the pieces in this issue.
4,May not be *original but still has same sprit,Some reviewers point about how much original this OST is. Maybe its not. But you can believe it has same sprit with movie.Many people may be satisfied..
2,Disappointing performance of classic Godfather music...,"I am a die-hard Godfather afficianado and I was terribly disappointed in this CD. When I purchased it, I didn't realize it was not a recording of the original soundtrack from the movie. Instead, it is a reproduction of the songs by The City of Prague Philharmonic. The performance is technically accurate, but does not at *all* convey the emotion of the movie's moments. It's as if the musicians studied the score, but never saw the movie. In track after track, the rhythms are not quite right, the mood is not set, etc, which is jarring for someone who knows the movies well. If you just want to hear some pleasing music, buy this CD. If you intend to buy a CD of The Godfather soundtrack in order to re-experience the magic of the Godfather movies themselves, look elsewhere."
5,bible,I love this bible !! It is perfect for my 8 year old to read -and my 6 year old to follow along with too. Definately reccomend this bible for young readers. The art is beautiful.
4,Great Bible for young readers,"Great product, I bought these as a graduation gift for out pre-k who were moving up into the elementary class."
4,Nice camera,I've had my camera for serveral weeks now and I'm generally happy with it. This is my first digital camera. Some of my learning has been trial and error. The owners guide could use some help. The camera is taking great pictures and is easy to use with the auto setting. I'm slowly using some of the manual settings. The movie mode was important to me. I bought a 1GB memory stick. It gives me enough memory for family events with still shots and movies. The quality of the movie was important and I'm happy to say we have nice movies from this camera. Indoors becomes very challenging because of lighting issues in the movie mode. I'm not sure yet if I can make an adjustment or not. Outdoors the camera take great movies for a still camera.For the price and features I'm very happy and would recommend this camera to any beginner.
5,Review on Sony DSC S90,This is having a very big screen and give a very good clarity at this price. After using this camera I dont feel like usnig any of the other cameras.
1,Outdated,"I have no idea whether this camera would have been good or not. We discovered that, although we bought the camera new, it was a five-year old model. None of the electronics stores we visited, including Best Buy and Radio Shack, sold a memory stick for this model. We should have been warned about that when we ordered the camera, and given a significantly recuded price, and given an opportunity to buy one or more memory sticks."
3,Its ok but not the best,"Hi: I've had this item for a little less then 1yr and I am having problems with the setting automatically changing when I am going to take a picture. Also pictures are coming out a bit blur and the zoom does not work well since the pictures are not very clear. I love the brand Sony but I think they can do better specially because of the price. Now adays you can find more variation of cameras at low prices. I am sending mine in for a repair since sony does not have any locations, so be careful."
2,Cybershoot DSCS90,"I've been a Sony fan as long as I remember, but this product is the worst Sony ever made.Picture qulity is bad, it won't take a high capacity memory stick, it's big and heavy.I'm looking for a diffrent camara now and this one is going to be my little girl toy."
1,Stay far far far away from SONY!!!,"Ok, so we got this camera about 3 years ago and paid $150-ish. We take pictures once maybe twice a year (and NO more than a 100 total so far). Well I needed it for a school project tomorrow and guess what... it's dead! It will let me look at the pictures I took three months ago, but nothing else... it instantly shuts right back off.Better yet, after an hour of internet research, apparently several people have had this problem... so I dug out my old SONY camera. It took two good pictures and then the picture/video card fried! It literally started trembling in my hand.I'm done with Sony... last month our two year old Sony DVD player died too. This used to be the best quality company around, now they've obviously turned to crap."
4,camera review,Love it ! I am a picture taker not a photographer and find this easy to use and takes nice pictures.
4,Great quality camera,"The Sony Cyber Shot is an amazing camera. I was totally impressed with the quality of picture it took as well as the large viewing screen on the back. After reading the maual, it was very simple to figure out the numerous features the camera has. I was a little disappointed that the camera did not come with a memory stick, however even without a stick the camera is able to hold many pictures in its memory. I would definately recommend anyone in the market for a new digital camera to give this one a shot."
5,Sony DSCS90,I purchased a Sony DSCS60 display model at Walmart in Dec 05 for $155.00. I am a 1st time digital camera user and found this camera easy to use. In Febuary 06 I purchased this DSCS90 for my son on Amazon for $150.00. It is the same camara only with a bigger screen. I wish I would have purchased mine from Amazon also!
4,A great first camera,"I bought this camera with the intent of capturing priceless moments with the greatest of ease. It more than accomplishes this goal. Straight out of the box it is not intimidating. I was considering purchasing a Nikon but the screen size of the Sony is one of the features that i liked the most. If you are in a quandry about which camera to purchase, place the Sony at the top of your list. its a great buy."
4,Good camera for first time users,"I have used digital cameras before but the pictures never seemed to come out right. With the cybershot my pictures come out beautifully and crisp. I have only had it for a short time but so far I love it. I like the fact that it comes with software that describes in simple terms how to use it and what all the functions are for, it even gives you examples and remedies to basic picture taking problems. I think this is a great camera."
5,Deadly Reckonings is Sinister Stuff!,"A wonderful achievement from this first-time author, with a furious page-turning plot and a well-defined evil cast of characters. Looking forward to the sequel."
5,What a brilliant first time author,"I work in a bookstore and for that reason I have to skim through hundreds of books every month to know what the incoming literature is about. Galvin has with this first time novel made a great impact and a great contribution to future writers. The intricate plots and the suspense at the end of each chapter keeps the reader involved and not wanting to put the book down. This is definitely a book that you'll enjoy as it keeps you reading on. Enjoy!!! And well done, first time auther Liam Galvin"
5,Great book!,"Gives lots of ideas you can do for free. I redid alot of my organizing and redid my bedroom and dresser drawers. Lots more room and easier to see what you have. If you need more room, want to reorganize.. this is a must!"
1,boring,boring boring boring and old style it didn't help me with any new idea it have not to much pic
5,"Beverly Hill's Organizer, Linda Koopersmith",I love Linda Koopersmith on the show Clean House. I am so excited to have her advice in this wonderful book with great ideas.
2,Please don't waste your money!,"This book has a few good tips, such as clothes folding techniques and upright-storage methods (as opposed to stacking in drawers), but overall it offers little that's new or original. For example: ""Nightstands are perfect for containing all that essential bedtime clutter, from reading glasses to an alarm clock. Put lamps on them to bring more light to the bed area."" Wow! Lamps on a bedside table? Who'da thunk?Many of the photographs in this book appear to have been taken in the '80s, as evidenced by the room decor, unless perhaps Linda's Beverly Hills clientele just happens to favor lime green walls and leopard-print carpet. And Linda's grasp on computer technology seems to be a bit lacking; she enthusiastically endorses the use of a Palm Pilot for organizing one's schedule and address book, yet seems to be unaware that programs like Quicken exist to help one balance one's checkbook.Overall, not worth the price."
3,Great book - if you own a home,"I was excited to buy this book after hearing rave reviews about it. When I got it, I set aside some time and started pouring over all the chapters. Unfortunately, I rent a small apartment with not a lot of storage, small closets, and not many cupboards. I figured this book would be perfect. Boy, was I wrong. If you don't have large closets, a ton of cupboards or a pantry, this book will be a waste of your money. The only good tips I got from it was how to fold my clothes, socks, etc., so that I could fit more in my drawers. The rest of it I skimmed through, and then put the book away since I couldn't use it. As I said, if you own a home, this book would be perfect for you. If you rent a small apartment with not a lot of closets and storage, then don't waste your money."
3,Very good Do-It-Yourself book,"The first half of the book was very informative for maintenance, but the second half is all about measurements and customizing your space if you are going to do it yourself. Loved the first half, but haven't read the second half because I don't need to do custom closets yet."
5,Great Book!!!,This book was what I was looking for; it gave me ideas on how to create storage areas. I knew how to declutter etc. I just needed ideas on how to make the most of the storage areas that I already have. (Closets etc) Excellent Book
5,An answer to my prayers!,"My first thought when I read the title was, ""Oh, right, like I can use any of the ideas in this hoyty toyty book!"" Boy was I wrong. The author suggests products which are easily available, not too expensive, and her easy to follow instructions for folding and storing clothing free up a lot of space in the closet and dresser. I have recommended this book to friends, and highly recommend it to anyone who is organizationally challenged like me!"
5,Even better than expected,Purchased this pusher to use with the Kitchenaid wide mouth chute and was pleasantly surprised to see it is a actually a dual pusher. There's an inner pusher cyclinder that you can use for narrowier items like carrots. The two for one capability is a definite plus.
2,OK,I have been studying the energy depletion for some time and didn't feel that this book added anything to what I have already read. I also thought that it was not as comprensive and complete as other books.
3,Nice at first then leaves hair greasy,I used to used the moisture manic shampoo and conditioner. I stopped using it because it had horrible buildup which led to my hair being greasy and weighed down. If you use this product I would recommend either using a good hair scrub at lease weekly or use it one week on one week off(use a different product line)
3,Will leave your hair very soft,"Nice scent, and definitely leaves your hair very soft. Sometimes you can find it on sale in a value pack. It's not good to use over time as it will cause build-up, but is great for when your hair is very dry."
4,Great Condtioner!,"This combined with the Moisture Maniac is a great solution to my thin hair. The dry winter weather and heat and sun in the summer just ruin my hair, so I need a daily shampoo and conditioner that actually keeps my hair healthy. I am really happy with this stuff, however Bed Head exaggerates it's products (humorous marketing tactic?), so this is not the ultimate cure for dry hair. I still use a clarifying shampoo and deep hydrating mask twice/week, but this is an excellent in between solution!"
5,Hands Down Best Shampoo/Conditioner for Dry Hair,My stylist recommended this product after checking out my super dry hair. I have always been open to using any brand whether that be salon brands or grocery store brands. I have tried everything from Pantene to Redken to Matrix and nothing has worked for me. My hair has never looked so shiny and healthy than with the Moisture Maniac product line. The best part is it feels good too. Many products build up in your hair and make it greasy and unmanageable. This product works. Get it! You will love it!
5,So much cheaper than the grocery store,Why not buy this product from Amazon instead of the grocery store? You'll get 3 times more shampoo and conditioner for the same exact price!
5,Beautifully balanced look at the contraversy between environmentalists and those who oppose them,"My first C.J. Box novel was NOWHERE TO RUN and I decided to endeavor to catch up on the series within three weeks. Obviously, OPEN SEASON is the book to start with and equally obvious is the reason for the series' popularity.My heading sums up the most outstanding attraction of this book. I noted a similar evenly balanced viewpoint in the first book I read, and this first book centering on the endangered species question does give both sides of the issue a voice while spinning a very enjoyable story with a capable but imperfect lead character. I won't go into further detail which has been ably covered by other reviewers, but I do sure recommend this book."
4,I really enjoyed this book!,First time I read CJ Box. The setting felt authentic and the story was very good. I will be reading more of the Joe Pickett books.
3,BETTER OUT THERE,"Heard a lot about the Joe Pickett series so got OPEN SEASON and have to say I was a little disappointed. Box may get better and better with each new book but I think the are so many better characters out in this mystery/detective genre. Now if specifically looking for an outdoorsman ok, Joe Pickett is the man..but for me I'll take Myron Bolitar, or Doc Ford, or Harry Bosch anytime."
5,"Great ""Open""-er",This is such a great beginning to a series. It's great that he makes you want to read the next one (which is even better). Keep reading this series!
4,Refreshing Start,"A hero, who is all too human, sometimes inept and sometimes heroic, is a pleasant addition to the genre. The author knows Wyoming and is able to impart the texture of the country to the reader. Bring on the sequels."
4,A great first novel,"CJ box shows the real West today, and he does it in an interesting and exciting way! This is must read for anybody who wonders what the real West is like. I suggest you pick up your copy today you will not be disappointed with this book."
3,"Different, but ultimately predictable","I've read two CJ Box novels, and, while they satisfy my need for atmosphere in a mystery, they fall short on plot and character. Joe Pickett and his family are the quintessential American family--sturdy, honest, loving, and sincere. The bad guys are bad, but we know they don't have a chance. That said, Box's lovingly portrayal of the American West reminds me of Tony Hillerman's. Still, I'd rather read Hillerman.The poor copyediting in this book really bothered me. After I found two obvious mistakes, I started to obsess on the inconsistent comma use. If I were the author, I wouldn't be happy."
4,New series for me,"I really enjoyed this book, I had been meaning to read this series for a long time. I can only hope they get better with each book and look forward to reading them all."
5,Winner!!!,C J Box's debut novel OPEN SEASON is a masterpiece from beginning to end. His authentic dialogue and realistic characters add the ring of truth to his plot. This page-turning novel will keep you engrossed well passed midnight. Mr. Box's talent shines from every page like the chrome on 50's classic car. Readers will easily sign on as fans eager for the next offering from this ace writer.Beverly...author of Righteous Revenge
1,Did I read the same book?,"After reading all the glowing reviews, I was expecting a tightly written, engaging book. Instead it was unimpressive writing with annoying characters, and a plot that was obvious 30 pages into the book. (That was the point where I told my husband EXACTLY how the book was going to go. The only thing I got wrong was the species of the critter in the cooler (I thought it would be a black-footed ferret.)) The bad guys and their motivations were all obvious that early in the book. The story plodded along, and I kept expecting SOMETHING that would throw a little twist into things, but it was straightforward and dull. Joe was kind of a dummy, his wife was drab, and his children were whining twits. A MUCH better read is Donald Harstad's Carl Houseman series. A real protagonist and set in the mid-west, but good writing and likable characters."
4,Open Season has real people,"C. J. Box has created real people with faults, feelings, frustrations and fears. The descriptions of typical Wyoming locations are accurate enough to make a Wyomingite feel like it is a place where he/she camped, hunted, or fished recently. The narrative is plausible because the politics truly exist. Do not begin reading this book in the evening because you will be up all night hiding behind a mountainside rock with a terrified little girl. You can't just put the book down and leave her there. Get on the waiting list for the next Joe Picket novel."
5,The best debut mystery of 2001!,"""Open Seasons"" is the brilliant debut mystery from C. J. Box, a new author who is quickly taking the mystery world by storm. If this book is any indication of his potential as a writer, we can expect great things from him. This is not only one of the best first mysteries I've read in a long time; it's one of the best, period.C. J. Box's writing is crisp and clean, the seemingly effortless kind of prose that is actually the reflection of many hours of toil and sweat. His plotting is likewise excellent, keeping the reader in rapt attention as he gradually tightens the screws of suspense.Go ahead and award ""Open Season"" the Edgar Award for ""Best First Novel."" If this book doesn't win, that would really be a crime.--David Montgomery, Mystery Ink"
3,"Not bad, but not great","It's a good story, but I had a hard time feeling any sympathy for the main character, Warden Joe Pickett. Consequently, I ended up skimming the last quarter of the book. I'll give C.J. Box another try with the next title in this series - maybe he will surprise me (hope so). So far, I much prefer Craig Johnson's ""Walt Longmire"" seriesHell Is Empty: A Walt Longmire Mystery"
1,Real Review,The good reviews must be friends and relatives.The characters are lifeless and flat. I read 120 pages and gave up. Just couldn't stand any more thoughts from the child characters. Silly.
3,Just OK,I read some of his later works and they were better. This was just too predictable and not that interesting
1,Don't Believe It!,"The back cover of this book was covered with glowing comments, and I assumed that these comments referred to ""Open Season"". Apparently they didn't because I bought the book and found that it was less than memorable, to put it kindly. The plot is a stretch, the characters are insipid, and the ending is a foregone conclusion. The poor reader is asked to overlook cliches, maudlin pieces of dialog, and outright contradictions in the construction of this novel. Joe Pickett (the main character) is a hapless twit who is undeserving of the role he is given. In the future I will make it a point to avoid Joe Pickett like the plague."
2,"Predictable, and very 'young adult'","I'm actually miffed at Lee Childs and Tony Hillerman. Their blurbs on the front cover sold me, so I bought the book. It was SO obvious I could scream. The bad guys, villains, were utterly predictable from the first. No shocks there whatsoever. And the entire short novel felt very much like I was reading young adult fiction geared toward 16 or 17 year olds.I was not impressed and felt cheated by the other authors who gave this book great blurbs. It should have been a graphic novel for little boys. Oh, and Joe Pickett? Very boring, very boy scout-one dimensional."
4,great debut,"Wyoming is a different world, and C.J. Box has done a tremendous job of bringing us into it with this debut novel about a Game and Fish warden named Joe Pickett. Pickett stumbles into a mysterious situation that involves three murdered outfitters, endangered species, and constant suspense about what's happening, and who's involved. Box is at his best when he's writing about the landscape, and its people, and the fact that he's a Wyoming native definitely shows. But this story will carry you through to the end with the rich characters and little guy vs. the world intrigue. Good start, Chuck."
2,"Good writing, poor story","Not sure what's with all the rave reviews. I picked up this book thinking it would be a mystery set in mountain country, and to some extent it is. Box has a good writing style, but I did't care for the story. Children being threatened and stalked (or neglected and beaten), harmless animals exterminated, to name a few points I didn't care for. It certainly seems as if Box knows his outdoors; i'd just like to read a story that's a little more straightforward mystery and less rambling mess."
4,Great Read!,"Just completed Open Season, my first C.J. Box book (there are many). Really liked it. The central character, Joe Pickett (he appears in many of Box's other novels) was well developed, interesting and believable. The story line was rich and kept my attention. The writing style is smooth and accomplished without being pretentious; it definitely does the job in an interesting way.My only criticism was the gratuitous carnage in the plot that was unnecessary and over-the-top; it detracted from the credibility--the only reason I didn't give it 5-stars. Other than that, it was great and I'll be reading more of Box's work."
5,It got me started,"A friend told me of this book and gave me her paperback copy. I read the first two chapters and was hooked. I purchased it for my Kindle and have read six of his Kindle version ""Joe Pickett"" books. They are great, I can't get enough of it. I'm afraid I'll go through the series and be lost. Advice for Mr. Box; write faster!"
2,Sounds more like the beginning of the night...,"This disc is loaded with the type of instrumental stuff you hear when the club first opens, before the crowd actually arrives. There are a couple of vocal tracks, including ""Get My Love"" and ""Power,"" but for the most part, this one is more brooding and dark than you'd expect from a Circuit CD. Not exactly the kind of stuff you want to pop into the CD player at your party. The few vocals present end up being glaringly obtrusive instead of welcome. Also, there are some noticeable scratches and pops in the vinyl used for the mix at times. Not exactly a great inclusion to the Circuit Sessions series, but if you are looking for the harder edged, darker stuff, you might enjoy this one. Track times are:1. Flying Song (4:35)2. B (6:23)3. Higher (4:54)4. Violent City (5:23)5. You Won't See Me Cry (6:17)6. Twisted (4:04)7. Get my Love (9:07)8. Love Divine (10:18)9. Rise In (8:45)10. Power (5:29)11. From the bitter to the Sweet (8:06)"
3,An introduction by choice examples only,"I have used this book as one required text in a general education course on Linguistics. In that capacity it is OK, but only as one component as it requires considerable complementing from other material. It is not suitable as a book from which to learn or teach the subject of linguistics in any serious or complete fashion. My GE course is designed to touch upon linguistics and its overall history, nature, and goals, without ever really serving as an introduction. Matthews's book is sort of like that. It is not a very good introduction to the subject, in the same way that a cooking show could not normally be used as an introduction to the art of cooking. While one may learn something interesting from watching Emeril prepare a dish or two, one could hardly say that was sufficient to introduce the whole subject of cooking."
2,'groovy',"After reading I recall these lines penned by the scholarly Penfield Geometris S.J.Plainly, a man of skill,and vast educationwho says in ten pageswhat a plain fellow would in onewriting eloquently and with great complexityof humanities speech inferiorityto natural chimpanzee.When a member of some illuminati mis - titles a book in order to press an agenda I feel cheated. Maybe I am just old fashioned but arguments in favor of `natural language', making ones examples from any language not English [or European].... pretty useless stuff unless one lives in an ivory tower at public expense. Almost any book which mentions the methods used in verbal encryption [in cryptology] is an improvement over this volume."
5,Quite Good,Certainly John Carter Cash is not a vocalist on the same level as his father (Johnny) or sister (Rosanne) but he does posess a decent voice and it's clearly heard on this most excellent album!
2,talent already passed down,he has an ok voice the talent was already given out to sisters carlene carter and rosie carter nix adams and june's stepdaughter rosanne cash and june carter cash and johnny cash june's voice passed down to her daughters but not her son i'm suprised because of who's john parents were but the talent was running rampent in the carter/cash family just not with john carter cash
2,Difficult to read...,"Unfortunately, this genre is full of amateurish efforts. The three books in this series are no different. Poor editing, bad grammar, unrealistic world building. Come on....if huge objects were heading for the earth, the population would be in mass panic. In this author's world, everyone seems calmly waiting to see what the objects are. I was hopeful that these books would hold my attention......nope."
1,Junk,Creed is a horrible writer. If he thinks himself a good writer then he should at least fire his editor. Bought this for Kindle. Trashed it after just three chapters. It ranks as one of the worst bits of writing I have ever encountered. I can't believe anyone ever bothered to publish this junk.
1,Not scriptural,"I did not agree with the non scriptural content. It was entertaining but thought it might lead people astray. There were so many errors, typos, ect. Someone was in a big hurry to get something to press."
3,Comes the End,Very intriguing story and Biblically based but the Rapture happens before they come. Grammatical and spelling errors abound hence the 3 stars.
3,big deal?,"While I do not claim that the other reviews about this book are wrong, I don't share the same enthusiasm either. Having lived two years in Japan, I can quote counter-examples for most examples which the authors quote to support their theories. Also many of their examples are out-dated, for instance those about the supposedly inefficient Japanese real estate market - as opposed to the US-american one. Speaking of which: There are several passages in the book which basicly say ""In Japan it's like this while in the rest of the developed world it's like that."" That's simply not true. I lived and worked outside Japan and I can assure you, the authors make the mistake of equalizing the USA with the rest of the developed world."
1,Throwing Away,"The coating on these bobby pins flakes completely off after more than a few uses. It begins within the first use. I was using these pins on a regular basis and kept them on my vanity. I was getting black flakes on my decollete, face, clothing and other beauty products on my vanity area including my contact station. The product is definitely dysfunctional and, depending on the coating product used and the exposed pin composition, possibly a health and safety issue. I will not be using this product any longer- what a waste. I would return for refund but the package broke open during shipping. There were bobby pins everywhere in the box and on my porch where delivered- and probably dozens in the shipping van. This is the most I've ever been dissatisfied with a product I purchased on Amazon."
1,Splintered,Dangerous if using for food--they splintered when putting food on them and when people tried to eat off of them.
2,Sad,"I bought this CD for the title cut. And for my ears that is the only one that is any good. I listened to this cut on Folk Alley, and I thought the CD would be great. I was wrong."
3,not the best,"I think this book is not so good because I found the models in this book a little difficult to fold and fly.I do think that the planes are beautiful and are great on display, but still the planes didn't fly well.my concorde flew a ""supersonic"" flight of 5 seconds to fly 2 feet and my spirit of st.louis didn't even make it across the dinner table.but also the book came with very valuable information.I recommend this book only to people who like making airplanes that are for decoration only."
3,Laptop replacement battery.,"First, let me start off saying that the company I bought this battery from was prompt, fair and I would buy from then again. That being said, I would not buy another battery like this one; my laptop is an older model so getting replacement batteries seemed fairly expensive. I went ahead and shopped for the lowest price, and got a fair deal on the battery. Only time will tell if the battery will last as long as the original (about two years). The problem I have is that the locking mechanism on this replacement battery does not work. All it takes is a slight move of the release ""switch"" and the battery falls out. I would have preferred the security of mind that the battery would not fall out accidentally as I move the laptop around. I just have to be careful to keep my hand from sliding the switch. I'll probably have another laptop by the time I need another replacement battery anyway... hopefully..."
4,Where to find the Old West,Go to http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/OldWest/ and you can get this book for $19. I can't believe some jerk is selling this book for $50.
4,Gurps Old West is a very good source book.,This book is very good. It has a lot of good informatin for those wanting to run a wild west campaighn or one on a world with equivalent tech level.
2,very strong toxic smell,"Beware, this glue has a very strong toxic smell, maybe, it does a good job, but you should know that fact if you use it around kids."
2,Big gloppy gloopy icky sticky mess,"I read at a few different places that this would be good for papercraft, but it is definitely not. The glue brush/handle is just drenched in the goop and it's impossible to apply it with any precision. Definitely not for smaller type crafts. The applicator is just messy, no way to do it with any accuracy. Possibly only good for larger projects but I don't know."
5,rubber cement,Great product at a great price. Just can't beat amazon for quality and excellence in handling the shipment of their products.
2,Glue,"It works good on paper but not good on wood, or metal. It's not gorilla glue or something! 2-1/2 stars"
5,Seeing is believing,"My daughter, a product of an all-digital world where cutting and pasting (and then re-positioning the item) is simple, couldn't believe that rubber cement was all that I promised it to be. But then she tried it for a family heritage scrapbook assignment and is completely sold on how cool it is to be able to use this glue (and, of course, roll up the excess into little rubbery balls...)This Elmer's version worked as well as any other brand I used to use ""back in the day"", so I am glad that it is still available for the new generation."
4,A Rip Off That's Worth It,"I was severly disappointed to find that this album was only 10 minutes long after paying full price for it. I wouldn't call this black metal either. I've heard it refered to as ""folk"" on multiple occasions though. After I got over my initial rage, which took several weeks, I decided that I really like both songs on the album and wanted to purchase another, and so I did. The music itself is inclusive of many keyboards, acoustic guitars (I think) and average drumming with decent bass production. If you can get over the price of the album for 10 minutes of music, and you like this sort of black/folk/metal, then you should be happy."
5,Excellent piece of television,This series keeps getting better and better! Although this season is darker it is great to see the story progress with such a good cast of actors.
4,It's Merlin.,"Third season has the same comedic, tender, dramatic moments as the previous two seasons, but this time with more special effects and the sense of impending doom. It's a tv series, so there are some plot gaps, cliche moments, and repetition that I have to ignore or then I wouldn't be able to enjoy the show. Bradley James, Colin Morgan, Angel Coulby, and Anthony Head again are impeccable, while I'm not so sure what is going on with Katie McGrath. She's not a bad actress, but I question the exhaustive use of evil smirks. Could just be a comedic gimmick that an American (well, at least this American) doesn't understand."
1,Terrible Quality Control,"I ordered Season 3. The discs came scratched up. One wouldn't read properly. I got another one sent. Same thing. Discs scratched up worse than the first on some of them. One disc won't read properly. The worst scratched disc in both sets is disc 5, although 3 was scratched in both sets as was 4. Either the manufacturer is messing up or the case they're in is messing up the discs.The same thing happened with Merlin Season 2. I had to order twice because the first set was scratched. The second one was ok. So out of 4 ordered, only 1 set was non-scratched.I like the show. But these DVD sets are junk. I'd only buy the next ones locally so I could keep returning it until I get a good set."
1,"Don""t waste your money","Never got past the first disc. It would play for awhile and then go back to the disc loading process. Then you had to go thru the beginning all over again till you got to the movie and then try to find out where you were in the chapter selection feature. Not just once, sometimes three times per episode. Quality control is the pits on this one. I sent mine back for a refund. I will say Amazon is a great place to buy. They really take care of their customers."
1,BEWARE OF THIS,THIS DVD SEASON 3 WAS NOT WHAT IT SEEMED. THERE WERE FROM A DIFFERENT REGION AND ME BEING A NEW CUSTOMER OF DOING THIS HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE WERE OTHER REGIONS OUT THERE THAT WONT PLAY IN A AMERICAN DVD PLAYER. SO BUYER BE WARE CHEAPER DOESN'T MEAN A THING IF IT WON'T PLAY AND THEN YOU CAN'T GET ANYONE TO HELP YOU GET YOUR MONEY RETURNED. WHICH IS NOW MY BIGGEST REGRET.!!!!! INFORMATION IS ONLY THROUGH EMAIL. I GAVE THEM MY PHONE NUMBER AND STILL NO ONE CALLS. I NEED HELP AND SUGGESTIONS TO WHAT TO DO NOW. PLEASE AND THANK YOU.
4,Disc Goblin?,Merlin is a great series & a lot of fun to watch. But on my copy Episode 6 has a glitch that freezes the disc. This can be overcome by jumping foreward to the next scene & then backing up very slowly to just after the glitch. You can then view most of the missing scene.
4,Good quality,"The dvd's arrived quickly and in good condition. My only wish is that the cover had a listing of all the episodes on each CD. But since this is the only USA compatible version I've found, it is what it is."
2,Throw the baby out with the bath water,"I was disappointed with this book simply because it lacked specifics. It was written in a vague sense of the MLM industry that could be applied to nearly any profession where money is a lure. Rather than being a balanced review of an industry, it smacks of one's bitter experience with a specific company. My challenge to the author is to write a guide book on MLM's based on biblical principles that shows the pros, cons and how to avoid the pitfalls of the industry."
4,One step at a time,"A very nicely written book working with this subject. Just open the book and follow along. You will soon be doing some amazing things with this great software. I am very happy with the software, and this book for showing me how to use the program. I knew absolutely nothing about working with this type of software. This book has brought it up to speed fast and I have been able to impress a lot of friends with my on hands knowledge."
1,"Absolutely AWFUL sound - do NOT waste your money on this one, or you'll be sorry","Ok, I've purchased tons of reggae dvds and cds here on Amazon.com, and I've come to realize that there will always be a few that really should have never been released - and this is the king of them all. The sound quality is absoutely atrocious - overmodulated screaming like some angry teen working at Burger King, yelling over the speaker when all you want is a whopper, fries and a coke. I took a chance and bought this because I love George Nooks, Tarrus Riley, Wayne Wonder and Cocoa Tea...but most of the other ""stars"" I've never heard of - not to mention the fact that their names are misspelled on the cover, which I thought was actually kinda funny. This was definitely a mistake, and now I know not to bother purchasing any of the other dvds in this series. Trust me, spend that money somewhere else...or you'll be very, very sorry."
5,hank zipzer the worlds best unichever!love it!!,I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!i love the hank zipzer books!!my friend recimended it and i love it.its about the worlds best unichever and all the trouble he gets himself into!!
5,Brilliant,I recommend all Hank Zipzer books for kids that struggle with any learning disabilities. Very funny and easy to read.
5,Such a great story!!,My daughter just couldn't get enough of this book. Finished it in a few days. Great story telling; real fun to read. She has already selected a list of other titles that she wants to read. We have another set of great chapter books to add to our library!!
4,"great photos, semi-beginner to advanced","This book came out before the huge glut, and I still like thumbing through it. The examples are marvelous. While it walks you very well through some projects, others are sort of ""on your own."" Good for an intermediate or advanced beader who wants to do more improvising, but might be frustrating for a new beader. I recommend learning the basic stitches elsewhere, but get this book, if only for the wonderful photos of work by very talented bead artists. It also has a useful section on balancing color and bead size, more useful information if you're ready to start personalizing your projects. It covers different stringing options well, and provides a good start for wire working. They could have left out the section on polymer clay, though."
3,Good for beginners,"This is a good book for beginning beaders. There are sections on stringing beads, using wire, weaving and weaving with a loom. The projects are extremely simple. The instructions are clear with easy to follow diagrams. Taylor gives good descriptions of the tools you will need and how to use them.It has many nice pictures. There are color photos covering all or part of almost every page. Often the jewelry in the pictures is printed actual size in the photographs. They are well done and integrated well.This describes the basic processes and does so clearly. If you are new to beading and want to move on to more advanced techniques then this is a good book for you. I don't think it will be helpful for experienced beaders. (I had done a large amount of wire work before reading this, and didn't find any of the sections helpful as I had already been exposed to the techniques.)"
3,Over My Head,"Some very beautiful pictures of jewelry but there is absolutely no way I would be able to decipher how to make 95% of it with the instructions given. If you are able to learn complex techniques with written instructions, very limited visual aids, and a picture of the final product this would be a great book. I need more of a visual of each step in order to learn a new technique. In all fairness a little more idiot' proof method."
3,Godless in the Soviet Union,"Be warned, this volume reads like a doctoral thesis. Lots of facts and footnotes, but not much excitement. Daniel Peris presents a Soviet Union, great on sloganeering, but not much in the action department. This should be a warning to our leaders here in the U.S., you cannot attack a situation by creating a bureaucracy, one need only look at our so-called ""war on drugs."" But I digress. The author focuses solely on the Soviet regime's efforts to remove Russian Orthodoxy from the life of the typical Soviet peasant or worker. I would like to have known more on how this organization approached Islam and other non-Christian religions in the hinterlands. As we approach the millenium, U.S. society has managed to accomplish, what a Soviet bureacrcy couldn't, the eradication of religion from the public square. The difference being is that we, as a people, simply appealed to society's base insticts."
1,pathetic,"I am a fan of LED light. I love my tiny Petzl Zipka head lamp. The Zipka's 3 little AAA batteries give decent (not great) brightness for 6 months! (I use mine ~2-3 hrs per week). So I had high hopes for this product, with its newer generation LED bulb and larger size. However, I find that an arm-numbing 3 minutes of vigorous shaking gives about 3 minutes of light! I literally timed it and found that with a 90 second shake (which they recommend) that it starts out brighter than my Zipka. But by 90 seconds of lighting, it is significantly dimmer. By 3.5 minutes there is not enough light to read by. Save your $25."
2,Not Impressed At All,This flashlight is not bright at all. Save your money with this one. It is not worth the money at all. I am very disappointed.
1,broken item,"When I received the flashlight it was broken I have tried to contact Mark Golden in Delray, Florida, the place the flashlight was sent from, and have heard nothing back this week."
3,low light,"I was disappointed in the low light it showed. It does last longer, but I would have preferred a brighter light."
1,not worth it,"The description says it will last for 2 hours, but we can't get it to stay lit more than a few minutes. That's after shaking it for several minutes. And the light is not any brighter than a traditional battery operated flashlight. Seems like a waste of money in my opinion."
1,Save your money,They don't work. Hard to charge and the led is not very bright. It was damaged. It also had been put together wrong and cut a wire so power never gets to the motor. The seller has been slow to resolve this.
1,EVERLIFE IS LITTLELITE,"9 of 9 people found the following review helpful:EVERLIFE IS LITTLELIGHT, November 22, 2005Reviewer: AGNAZZO (Tampa, Florida United States) - See all my reviewsLIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIFE FLASHLIGHTS. THE PARTY THAT SAID THAT THESE FLASHLIGHTS ARE CHARGED UP DURING SHIPPING IS SUFFERING FROM SHAKING OF THE HEAD. IT TAKES AT LEAST A MINUTE OF SHAKING AFTER DELIVERY BEFORE THE FLASHLIGHT IS GIVING OUT ITS MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF LIGHT WHICH IS VERY LOW. AFTER THAT TO KEEP IT OPERATING MORE SHAKING IS IN ORDER. THE ILLUMINATION WHICH IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO OTHER BATTERY FLASHIGHTS DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY AND NEED ADDITIONAL SHAKING TO KEEP IT GOING. THIS FLASHLIHGT TO BE FAIR MAY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE. LED FLASHLIGHTS THAT USE BATTERIES ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO THESE SHAKING FLASHLIGHTS.THE BATTERIES LAST A VERY LONG TIME DUE TO THE LOW POWER THAT LEDS OPERATE AT."
1,Defective!!!,"Recieved 11 days after order was placed. Secure packing, but I think they sent a returned (defective) flashlite. The plastic case that it comes in was open, the lense was scuffed. When I shake the flashlite to charge it the lite blinks on & off, so it never gets fully charged. I can hear a small piece of something that rattles inside. I called & got answering machine, left message to return my call, I also emailed them about 3 hours ago.I have not heard anything back yet, I will keep you informed, Merry Christmas."
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought the individual volumes 1 & 2. Combined, they have the exact same run time as the Complete Series set according to Amazon. However, the episode ""Imprint"" is not included in either volume. I wrote to Starz/Anchor Bay and they claim it IS on the big set. What a ripoff! It's bad enough they said they'd never release the full season in order to sucker people into buying the original individual releases. Now they pull this nonsense."
1,Used Sotftware that requires validation,"Whoever sold this had given an incomplete information regarding its background use. From the descrition of the product, it never mentioned that this software is a one user program and it requires a validation code to register. Since its been used by another company, we cannot register the program and get a validation code. AND THIS IS TRUE FOR ALL QUICKBOOKS SOFTWARE. Customers must be reminded about this.We are planning to return the product and will buy our own latest program.Thank you"
2,2006 QuickBooks,I was disappointed in my purchase. The Seller described the product as a complete set but it was missing the Start-up and Quick Reference Guide. I have tried to contact the Seller but did not receive a response. I have been very disappointed because I feel I was misled because the Start-up and Quick Reference Guide was missing. Other Sellers indicated they were missing the guide and advertised a lower price. I paid more for what was suppose to be a complete set.
2,"Very comprehensive, and Very Cumbersome","I have used a lot of software, but I do not remember using much that is as difficult to use or learn than Quickbooks. I have learned it over time, but there seem to be several functions in it that could be done in fewer steps. I would not upgrade unless I absolutely had to. The program is usable, but I am not interested in investing a lot more money in it. It works for my small business, but I could still probably get by with Quicken, as I do not write checks on it. I do kind of wish I had stayed with Quicken. The most annoying thing about the program was that I was going credit card data downloads in Quicken, but when I changed to Quickbooks, it would not let me download data from my Quicken credit card, it wanted me to switch to a Quickbooks credit card, or ask permission of all my credit card providers. I appreciate the security, but since both programs are made by the same company, this just seemed like a scam."
2,Do-it-yourself payroll users -- beware the upgrade!,"I upgraded from Quickbooks Pro 2003 because support for online banking was expiring. So I get my upgrade from Amazon (nice price!), install it, and everything's fine.Until I go to cut my first payroll check.Then, suddenly, I find out that YOU CAN'T DO YOUR OWN PAYROLL ANYMORE! It has never been worth it to me, as a one-employee company, to spend $199 a year to calculate two payroll checks a month. I've got access to free calculators online -- why spend the money?Apparently, because Intuit needs the cash, that's why. So they strip out the payroll features and force you to subscribe.Boo, hiss ... Had I known this was going to be an expensive pain in the neck, I would have held off upgrading. (I mean, how badly did I need online banking?) But I guess that's why Intuit hid the feature downgrade in the find print, huh?"
1,Get MS Money for Small Business,"I have been using MS Money for Small business since I started a one person psychology practice after having been an owner of a large group practice where we used Quickbooks. I never liked QB. I thought it was too complicated to get started and now if I want to use the online banking, I have to pay $15 a month to my bank and an extra $200 for a one person payroll. I found MS Money for Small Business very easy to set up, no charge for online banking with my bank, and one year free payroll that costs $10 a month after one year. Seems to me that using MS Money for SB is a non brainer and using QB is an expensive and complicate proposition."
4,Quite satisfied,"The product is very good and does everything I need to run my small business. HOWEVER, I was disappointed to find that running even the simplest payroll requires an ongoing subscription - no payroll features come with the package without subcription.The tutorials were very complete for basic setup, but to ensure that I made full and proper use of the features, I spent two hours with my accountant's Quickbooks specialist. Consequently, I didn't need Intuit's support and can't speak to their effectiveness."
2,Slow !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Anyone who gives Quickbooks Pro 2006 a good review has not used a prior version of Quickbooks. The slowness of the 2006 version over previous versions is significant.
4,A good upgrade,"I was a long time user of QuickBooks 2004, I decided to upgrade to get some of the latest features. And I would have to say I am 100% satisfied. The upgrade process went without problem. The software is much easier to use, the new navigation center make dealing with invoices 5 fold easier then it used to be. Over all I am very satisfied with this software. The only thing about it is it starts up a little slow, but no slower then the older versions that I can tell."
4,Phenom review of Quickbooks,"Simplicity is the key. The user interface is friendly, easy to access menus, navigation system, setup is simple with extensive help.Good accounting features. The templates and reports are excellent.What phenom didn't like,* Slow start up. The application is huge and does take time to startup. I'm positive this is on Quickbooks mind, user experience and response time is very critical for the success of a project."
5,Excellent software that's easy to use,"I heard many different accounts of how this software would be too slow and too hard to use, but it isn't. From the moment I installed QuickBooks Pro it was very easy to navigate and I actually set up my buisness in a little under one hour; invoices and all. I highly recommend QuickBooks Pro."
3,Blotware personified,Why do interface changes require additional 450 Meg over 2005 version? Being forced to upgrade from 150 MB basic 2002 to EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEGABYTES. Will next version require a dedicated additional harddisk?
2,Improving but not a trend setter,I have used many accounting software but most convinient and easy is TALLY from India. Many of the arguments in QuickBooks are not accounts oriented and merging of complicated journals are not allowed. I think ther are lots of scope for improvements.
1,Buy a hot dog for a $1 and pay $1.25 every year for the bun,"Quickbooks may be an excellent small business software package, but I will never know. The ads and discription imply it has a payroll program included in it. Surprise - not only can you not run payroll, the cost of the single payroll module is more than the A/R, A/P, G/L,Inventory, reports,and tracking package you just paid for. But wait - you have the privledge of paying EVERY YEAR. I was going to switch from Peachtree but at least in PT you can (it is very obtuse and cumbersome)make the tax changes manually. PS. 1 copy of Quickbooks will be on ebay soon."
1,Tired of being nickel and dimed to death,"After using QB for a couple of years, it has become clear to me that Intuit is really only interested in one thing: how to wring as much money out of my pocket and into theirs. Their short-term tech support, fees for everything, and lack of upgrade prices, combined with their policy of upgrading every year makes it very expensive to keep up with them. I am giving up and going to the new Microsoft product. At least they have excellent pricing for now, and a 1-year support policy."
3,QuickBooks Pro 2006 upgrade review,"Quickbooks Pro 2006 has no upgrade characteristics or pricing. The software takes about 1 GB, and restructures the entire old Quickbooks database. The new screens are easier to navigate, but experienced users will probably debate that. The report module is more flexible and easier to use. Supposedly better payroll functionality, but we don't use that module."
4,Very Good Product,"I purchased QuickBooks Pro 2006 after taking a QuickBooks class. I'm sure I was much better prepared to use it having done that. The Learning Center in the program is helpful but some knowledge of bookkeeping processes is needed to avoid much trial and error. I do not believe it is as easy to use as advertised, but I'm convinced it is an excellent program and will do what I need it to do."
3,"Product fine - Update, not so much","The product is fine, however, the update that pops up about two weeks after installation fails with an error message that cannot be troubleshot online. It is frustrating, but what would you expect for a product that was manufactured five years ago? I expected that the update would run. Dealing with customer services isn't my idea of a good time because it is so time consuming, but I will try it to see if my usually correct assumption can be dispelled."
1,You said New but it was used!,This was a software package. The cd had been opened and it was Scratched. I receive it by mail so who know what happen.
1,Quickbooks Pro 2006 - a real disappointment,"Intuit has failed their longtime customers with this product. It is so slow, I want to switch back to my 2004 version, but can't, because upon installation of the 2006 version, my historical Quickbooks data was converted to a new format, and now there is no going back. They warned during installation about the format change, but they didn't warn the buyer that the new version was miserably slow in some ways. I consider it a real ambush and very close to fraudulent, because their tests had to show the slowdown in performance before they brought it to market. I wonder if enough negative feedback can be generated to induce them to put out some kind of fix?"
1,Expected better,"I have been using Quickbooks for a while now and I must say I would not choose this product again. The only reason one might consider it is that third parties such as accountants seem to be familiar with it, making review easier.One thing that really burns me is what would be so difficult about having payroll built into the system without the monthly fees. Yes, the withholding laws may change, but my accountant can keep me aprised of any changes I need to make. The monthly fee structure for payroll is a first class ripoff."
3,Norton AntiVirus Users BEWARE!,"I contacted Intuit (the makers of Quick Books 2006) to see if it is true that Norton AntiVirus corrupts the files of Quick Books 2006 when QB does it's automatic updates. The Customer Service Representative said, ""Yes, this is true."" If you have Norton, feel free to contact Intuit yourself before buying, at 1-888-320-7276."
2,NOT a Better Upgrade -- QB 2006 Pro NEEDS IMPROVEMENT,"I have recently 'upgraded' from Quickbooks Pro 2003 to 2006. What a disappointment. If I had known that I would get less of a product for more money, I never would have 'upgraded.' There are many bugs in QB 2006 Pro. They did away with many of the shortcut key strokes, and memory recall has disappeared from custom invoice data fields. We are now spending much more time invoicing our customers because we have to re-key repetitive data into the invoices. QB 2003 Pro offered much more flexibility and more keyboard shortcuts, as well as data recall that simplified the invoicing process. If you are running an older version of QB Pro, DO NOT, repeat DO NOT, DOWNGRADE to QB Pro 2006! The biggest problem I have now is that I cannot revert back to QB Pro 2003. Once you convert to QB Pro 2006, you are stuck! It does NOT allow you to revert back to an older version. Do yourself a favor and pass on this product."
1,Quickbooks 2006 extremely disappointing - use caution,"Quickbooks has been a leader in small business software for many years, but the release of QB 2006 is a huge disappointment. Whereas on the surface it appears to have many great new features, once installed you find it is an extremely buggy, poorly developed softwared. Quickbooks rushed this to market prior to it being ready, and the results are dreadful. Before you purchase, view the quickbooks online support column, and read the many issues it faces.I am a CPA and have recommened QB for many years, but am now searching for an alternative... Poorly done, Intuit!"
2,NOT MUCH NEW,"Quickbooks and computer magazines have emphasized the new features of Quickbooks 2006, but they are really quite minor. The ""home page"" is a new set of icons for getting to the different features just as using the toolbar icons in Quickbooks 2003, etc. You still can't pay with your own check style - Quickbooks only lets you print on blank check forms purchased from Intuit. Also, to do payroll you must purchase additional services to get the tax tables, etc. and a hardcopy manual is an extra you must purchase. Since Intuit is discontinuing payroll services to older versions of Quickbooks, many will ""upgrade"" just to keep getting tax table updates, but there are add-ins from other companies that can keep your older Quickbooks payroll working just fine."
1,Quickbooks 2006 - not your best investment,"I recently purchased this product when the version of Quickbooks I have been using was discontinued. Though the screens are easier to use, the bugs in the program are overwhelming. I have spent hours on the phone with technical support, who cannot figure out how to solve the problem. The technician tells me that Norton Antivirus interferes with their automatic download of updates, corrupting files. I cannot complete my year-end books for my business and I have wasted countless hours on this. Save your money and purchase an accounting software that has been better tested before release and that has fewer problems."
1,Don't buy used,I made a mistake in not reading the reviews before buying this product. But don't ever buy used Intuit software. You can't use it at all.
1,BEWARE THIS TERRIBLE SOFTWARE!!!,"Quickbooks ""sunsetted"" my previous version, forcing me to buy this horriblle, buggy software. It lacks many of the features that I liked from my previous version (2003), runs much slower, uses 10 times as much memory, and is full of bugs. I regularly need to run Windows system restore when all of my company data disappears. Avoid this product at all costs. Time that I used to spend on more important business functions is now spent trying to get this crappy software to work. I have used Quickbooks for 12 years, and 4 editions, but this will be my last Intuit product. I wish I could give it 0 stars!"
3,Quickbooks 2006,Very difficult to navigate without studying the manual or having someone assist you.
3,2006 more expensive than 2007,Why is it that Amazon is charging more money ($595.00)for Quickbooks 2006 than Quickbooks 2007 (169.00)?
5,ADDICTED.....,I really enjoy the taste of peppermint. So I just orders a case from AMAZON and sitting back and enjoying! Love LifeSavers..
4,live-safers,For me the 12 pack is a nice way to keep them from getting everywhere. one big bag would have been all over in the drawer. Also helps keep them fresher.
5,Salsa At Its Classic Best,"The arrangements, individual musicianship, and zest of these performances make it a classic. As is the case with this generation of Fania reissues, the remastered sound is fresh as day-- the music could've been recorded yesterday. If you have any interest in Latin music, this is a must-have."
5,Excellent Salsploration disc,"If you have no albums from this fine Orchestra...this is the one to get. If you are already familiar with the group, chances are you already have this album. Purely hypnotic, enjoyable salsa throughout. This is not a new CD, this is the classic stuff."
4,"A good product, but wasn't needed.","Buying this charger did me no good, as the toy had a burned out motor, so now I have a charger I can't use."
5,Towable Fun,We've used this tube for 2 years & it has held up well. I agree with the submarining comments & agree with the solution.
1,Missing Part -- Can you Send?,"This tube arrived without the valve -- it's called a Boston Valve, and the tube will not hold air without it. I have out of town guests coming early next week and want to be able to use the tube.Can you send a Boston Valve immediately to the original shipping address? Contact me by email if you need me to re-confirm my address.Please advise.R,P Heye"
1,Recived a diferent product,"Yo soy de COlombia, decidi comprar un kwik tec g force y recivi un producto totalmente diferente, recivi un airhead U tube, es imposible hacer la devolucion del producto quedo muy aburrido con este. Este fue recivido por un tio en los estados unidos y el no sabia cual era el producto que yo habia pedido.Im from Colombia, I bought a kwik tec g force product And I recived a diferent one, I recived an airhead U tube, now is imposible to turn it back. it was recived by an uncle in united states and he doesnt now wich product was the one that I bought."
3,"Adults-5 star, kids-0 stars","This is my first time reviewing a product. We live on a lake and have had multiple tubes. We took this one out for the first time today and the first ride was set for a slow cruiser with a 3 year old and 6 year old. When going slow, this tube totally dives, which knocked both kids off right away and neither wanted to ride again. Then we put the 13 year olds on it and it works great. If the riders are older and can keep their weight back to start, it's really fun. It goes fast, catches good air, and is easy to hold on to. But going slow is not an option, and is actually pretty dangerous for younger riders that can't keep their weight back.Bottom line, if your riders are older this is a great tube. If it's going to be used for little kids or for slow cruising, it is not a good tube."
5,super durable,"We have owned a lot of tubes, and this has been the most durable one we have ever owned. It says two person , but we have 4-5 kids on at once. It will submarine if you dont keep your weight back, but thats easy to deal with. It can start to go airborne if you go fast enough (or too fast)."
2,O'brien vs Airhead,"This is my first time reviewing an item ....... but I feel the need to set the records straight. I have purchase 6 O'brien tubes over the years, but I bought my boys Airheads Christmas 2010 because of the positive reviews. And don't get me wrong - it is a decent product. BUT - we're on the second season of the two Airheads tubes and I've had to repair them with Aqua Seal 5 times. One of the tubes is beyond repair. The heat stitch popped and now it looks like a balloon. I'm switching back to O'brien. My boys are rough on tubes, but O'brien definately masters the race for endurance year-over-year."
3,Great prodcut but!!!,"We love the G - Force we have bought them for years and use them hard. They are durable but in the last two seasons the air is leaking out sooner, the tube is fine outside but the bladder is not lasting long and we can not find replacments. We are getting a bit soured on a prodcut that we have loved since it came out. Last tube only lasted about 8 weeks or about 25 hours of use."
1,won't hold air after 3rd outing,"This towable was great...3 times. After that, it sprung a leak right at the fill valve which is impossible to repair.Amazon won't refund $$$. Too bad :("
3,UV issues with the shell,We have owned this about 1.5 years. good design and kids love it. The inner tube holds up great. However the shell ripped after 1.5 years. UV rays eat the shell up.
4,Good Value,I bought this for my dad at Christmas and he just got a chance to use it this week. He said thanks for the new tube it rides like a Cadillac. I'm can't answer any durability questions yet but he seems to like it.
5,Tons of Fun!,"We just got this towable but it survived a very busy Memorial weekend. We had a blast towing 2 adults or teenagers at a time, at fast speeds and crazy turns! It definitely can handle well over 300 lbs. It doesn't do well with 1 person or at slow speeds. This is meant for thrill seekers! I recommend this,especially for the money. It's the best priced tube of it's size. Enjoy!"
1,Disappointing,"This was definitely not worth the investment. First, the notes are out of tune, and badly. One key fell of completely the first day, and the sticks broke on the 2nd."
4,Great product for a fan,"I got this for a dear friend who is a great fan of the movie - he was totally over the moon.This makes a great gift for christmas, birthdays or for no reason at all!"
5,Excellent Look Inside the Movie Industry,"Modine showed up on the set of Stanley Kubrick's 1987 Vietnam War masterpiece ""Full Metal Jacket"", in which he starred as Private Joker, armed with his weapon and his gun and his Rollei.Not only does Modine prove himself to be quite a talented photographer, but his behind-the-scenes account of the making of the motion picture is a wonderfully revealing look inside the movie making process that few people see.If you've ever been curious about how movies are made, or are curious about what it was like to work with Stanley Kubrick, Matthew's book lifts the curtains and let's you inside."
4,Full Metal Jacket,I read this book pretty much one Sunday. I love the Kubrick film and wanted to read about actor Matthew Modine's memories of working with such a great director. Great insites and trivia fun to read and he took a lot of great personal pictures.!!
5,Interesting,Matthew Modine (who plays Joker in the movie) published the story of first meeting Stanley Kubrick to finishing the movie. The filming was pushed back due to R. Lee Ermey's car crash and Vincent D'Onofrio hurt knee. Plus the drama that ensued between the cast and crew. I would recommended this book for anyone who loved the movie.
2,Cleaner two,"2 1/2Too flimsily short for its own good, some of these sonic subtleties do contain interlocking textures of interest."
4,Excellent departure from the 'Build a Kewl Web Site' books,"Jones, et al, do an excellent job outlining the arguments for applying a systems design methodolgy to web site development. The book sets out to outline how that methodology can be applied to web site design and what that means in regards to more ""traditional"" design methodologies. This is a great overview of the process and more of a high-level overview than an actual nuts-and-bolts guide."
2,Very basic information,"This book doesn't live up to its title as it covers just the very basic elements of creating and maintaining a web site. I was hoping for more on usability design, navigation, maintenance, etc."
2,"Not a serious book, even for managers.","This book says it discusses a lot more than it really does. It will waste your time. There is no value in this book unless you have never read anything about the Internet, web sites, and light software project management."
2,Couldn't really reccomend,"This books promised a lot but didn't really deliver.It tried to cover too many topics broadly and I think that this detracted from the books overall value.Also, the book seemed to focus on old-style web sites where each page is stored as an individual file, rather than sites that are dynamically generated eg ASP, JSP etc."
1,A book for dummies,"This book is not for engineers, but for dummies. It only covers very basic aspects of website design and does not offer any methodology for a website engineer."
5,Keep These True Stories near you,"Little ones whispering in God's ear are powerful and always heard. This compilation of true prayer stories keeps me reading, not wanting to put it away, and then longing to find a chance to read it again. Often I smile, frequently show a tear. Many times the stories remind me of someone and someplace where God answered my personal prayer and I failed to recognize it appropriately, failed to thank God for His answer. I have found this book one I treasure as the stories encourage me to pray childlike prayers and to eagerly wait for the answer."
5,Tears of Joy,"I can not remember how I found this book online but I am glad I did. I highly recommend this book for anyone who may have a million and one questions about their own faith. It gives you a new perspective and WANTING to pray to God at night because you know he hears you.There are so many good stories that I want to highlight but I would not give them the justice it deserves, so all I want to say today is to please purchase this book. I am so glad God creates different types of people, with different types of stories because it brings us all closer together."
2,"Works , but flimsy .. Manf. won't respond",I have had this unit for awhile and it does work. However it is made from very thin plastic and will not stand a simple bump without falling apart. I ordered some anti-bacteriostat from Essick and they sent a third of what I paid for and will not respond to my requests for an explaination.
3,it's ok,"Well like a lot of others have said, you have to fill it up too often.I would think for the size it is, they could of made it hold more water.It is kind of loud on the highest setting. But other than those two things we like it."
2,I expected more,"I have ordered a product by this company with good results. This time what I received was sub par. The poster paints were all dried up. An easy fix to get some from a local store but my little one was disappointed that we couldn't use it right away. There is only one glitter glue tube in this so that may not be enough to satisfy kiddies that like a variety.Once we got our own paints, it turned out to be a decent craft. We will go through the six choices in no time. The big box of crafts and tissue art by same company were better values for me."
3,Not quite what I'd bargained for...,"I thought that I was getting wooden animals and was dissapointed when we opened it and discovered the animals were cardboard-my fault for not reading the description thouroughly but for the price I would have expected better. Also two of the paints were dried up and unusable so we had to supplement with what we had.On the plus side-the project was a lot of fun - we all had fun creating and decorating our animals and the accessories (crayons, sequins, glitter glue, googly eyes, and feathers) are plentiful and nice.Overall-a little pricey for cardboard but we had a good time with it and frankly it was probably a lot more fun that some crap piece of plastic toy in the same price point."
5,beatles in the pure state,who likes the beatles can not miss - right people in place and wrong time - Superb - pure beatles
1,disappointing,"Holy smoke was I suckered in. This is a terrible record. Just because these guys once were in the same room as the Beatles doesn't mean they can make music. I tried to listen to this disc a second time just to see if maybe I was being unfair. I wasn't. There's nothing here to hook into. This is one of those obscure bands that deserve their obscurity. Bad singer, no hooks, nothing. A complete disappointment. I gave it one star because there was nothing lower and for the mildly interesting story about meeting a couple of Fabs."
5,Resurrection,"After all these years...I grew up in St. Louis and was in The Aerovons for a short period after this album was recorded. I went on to work in the studios in L.A. with producer Kim Fowley and many groups and artists. Tom Hartman wrote the music, with the exception of one song, for Resurrection and is a very talented guy. Though a couple of the tracks are way too close to Beatle songs, the other tracks border on genius for its' time. I'm glad Tom is finally getting some recognition for this work. I understand he is in Florida, still in some portion of the music business. Tom - it's great to hear this again! I'll look you up."
4,"My world isn't ""little"" at all.....","Although I thought Mr. Richardson hit on some valid and extremely emotional points throughout the book, I'm concerned as to why he chose to prefice the title ""In the Little World.."" I am a woman with dwarfism and do not like to be labeled ""a dwarf"", as I'm sure many others don't like be labeled ""a Black"", ""a Jew"", etc. My world isn't little at all - it's filled with big dreams, goals for the future, hobbies, needs, a hearty appetite for life,etc. As I read some of the other reviews, I am also ""normal"" and I challenge anyone to define what ""normal"" is in this day and age. Remember, We're all one family on earth and the more we seperate each other due to race, height, sex, whatever, this pushes us all back 50 years. I just wished that Mr. Richardson had hit on this point further. Labels not only form barriers, they segregate."
2,Gossip and Details,"This book is about someone who goes knocking on someone's door and listens to their family genetics and secrets. I truely doubt the public will be interested, unless your a dwarf. Especially if you want to see where your at in this book."
4,Insight for everyone -- short or tall,"What could have been simply a voyeuristic look into an underreported world becomes something much greater in the hands of John Richardson. Unlike many reporters, Richardson has the philospohical chops to provide real meaning to what he witnesses, and to bring out truths that aren't obvious to the naked eye. Throughout the book, Richardson surprises by often focusing his energy on the fears and hidden motivations of ""normal"" people -- the parents, the siblings, the doctors, the gawkers.If anyone should feel discomfited by the book, it's not the dwarves, it's the tall people -- myself included -- who have so much difficulty dealing with what the ""little people"" represent."
4,Big Story,"Mr. Richardson has a unique perspective; like being an alien dropped into an LPA convention. Frankly, it's the LP's (little people) who usually feel the way Mr. Richardson does, which is quite an interesting thought flipped over. It's not how much different dwarves are to the world, it's how they perceive themselves and when all is said, they are human after all with needs the same as everyone else.Thank you's go to this book and Mr. Richardson for giving the ""talls"" something to chew about including a portrayal of one ""obsessed but saintly"" orthopaedic surgeon Steven Kopits who has since retired and how this doctor has sacrificed his career and his family to make LP's more functional. This book and Dr. Kopits have both succeeded in a very ""big"" way."
2,Won't lay flat,Kept bowing out from the garage door no matter how tight I tried to keep it flush. Finally took it down and installed a more study product.
4,Harder to install than you think,I have been installing this on my garage door and it is harder than it looks. If you don't know the cuts right the garage door won't shut. The ones already on the wood is much easier to install. This is a two person installation process because keeping the product over your head to nail it in is difficult.
4,garage door seal,"A little hard to install, but worth the effort. Looks fine. Installed with metal siding trim, so need to make sure nails/screws long enough to anchor to wood. No drafts now."
4,Works but I modified it,Great product but trying to use all those little nails was a bit much for me. I used my staple gun to help and it worked great!
1,Looks good... At First,"When you install this, it looks great and functions well. However, after about 8 months, I noticed it was starting to curl away from the garage door. The sun had dried it out and made its edges start to curl outward. Not only that, it was so dry there were chunks starting to fall off. It didn't last a year before I had to pull it all down. Not sure what else I can try, but this is not the answer in the long run."
4,"Works as advertised, can be difficult to nail","This seal works well keeping out the mosquitos and keeping in the conditioned air for our garage in south Florida. It does a good job with wind driven rain as well. I found it difficult to simultaneously hold the strip firmly in place, hold the nail and hammer it in. I only have two hands so I used zip screws and a nut driver on the cordless drill. Installed in no time at all, but some may not like the exposed screw heads. Make sure to install with the door closed to ensure a proper seal. I gave it four stars because of the nearly impossible (or very awkward and time consuming) installation with nails. Otherwise, works great."
3,Okay,"Though interesting, Flamingoes aren't exactly a favorite of mine, speaking of animals and birds. His legs are loose and floppy. He isn't the most fun to play with, so of course, he is in good condition. I can only see collecters wanting him badly."
3,THE BACK SIDE OF TRUSTS,"We've all heard Suuze say ""Everyone needs a Trust."" This book tells how the Attorney, Trust Officer, and others establishing a trust for children abused their fiduciay duties and used their influence to create a lifetime job for themselves, one from which it may be impossible to fire them and how they take advantage of the children to feather their own nest. Every parent establishing a trust, should include a power permiting the beneficiaries to fire the trustee without cause and at anytime. This book tells how the Johnson children were scarred and marred for life by the trusts created for their benefit. Read it and weep. Robert Rice"
3,Fun Soundtrack,I have small kids and they have fun listening to this soundtrack. We've probably listened to it a hundred times in the car.
4,Good cheap intro quantum book,"I have had little background in QM, but this book seems to explain the basics along with the fundamentals in a logical order. (Nice philosophical and logical development of Schro's Eqn and operators too) Arranged in a somewhat strange manner, it definitely uncovers some of the more misunderstood concepts (such as Dirac notation and dispersion relations), and at this price it's probably well worth it! Mostly based on applications dealing with solid state physics."
5,"Made me angry, made me cry, made me determined","Others have already given great reviews of this book - I just wanted to share how validating this book is to someone who is working up the ladder. Fels backs up her insights with clear, irrefutable evidence - her explanation of the ""spelling bee"" study has helped me to convey precisely how antagonistic our culture is to a woman ""taking"" recognition from a man.This book is not about male-bashing; it's about seeing the ways in which our society (male and female) consistently discourages women from seeking recognition for their achievements - and ultimately from achieving anything at all. While Fels offers some guidance on how to correct the imbalance, I wish there were a clearer path laid out. I suppose that's up to us to figure out."
3,automatic transmission reprair:1984-1989 inport cars & light,Transmission modle and trouble shooting
4,A true gem,"This book is proof that Marcus Aurelius is one of history's most overlooked philosophers. He has been completely taken for granted. Putting aside the relative quality of the writing in this book, the notion that the correspondence between a great philosopher and his mentor would survive is unbelievably exciting. Yet this book is buried away, to be read only by hard core fanatics and those that troll the bibliographies of translations of Meditations.The Loeb translation is worth having and worth reading through. One can watch Marcus grow, be admonished, be encouraged and be taught. Perhaps it is time to combine Volume I and II together as the extra pages of Latin seem to be particularly outdated in 2009. Other than that, this book is a both a helpful tool for understanding one of the best Stoics works of all time and watching a noble man become the figure that towers over all of us."
3,The Price Is Right,"The Mustek VDC 3500 is certainly in the low-price catagory when it comes to digital cameras and, you while you may not always get what you pay for you are certainly likely have to pay for what you get most of the time. So it is with this camera. I don't know how many pixels the camera has, but the number must be fairly limited. This translates into a lower picture quality than you might want, but certainly satifactory for photos that will go on the web. The memory card only takes 4 photos in the ""fine resolution"" mode but an additional 8 photo memory card is available. The battery costs about $7 and seems to last for about 25 photos with flash. Not a bad camera, but don't expect anything wonderful at this price."
2,Good Idea Weak Execution,"SCARLET TRACES is one of the many stories that follows up on H.G. Wells' THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, imagining what happened in Britain a decade or so after the failure of the Martian invasion of Earth, with Martian-derived technologies much in evidence.This is an interesting premise for a story, but alas SCARLET TRACES fails to either explore the idea very thoroughly or construct a good story out of it, building the plot around an ""evil conspiracy"" that the reader easily spots as silly: ""You can't use animals? Bollochs!"" One might be happier with SCARLET TRACES if the artwork was interesting, but alas it's just second-rate. Readable in an automatic sort of way, but not memorable."
3,Good Mogwai (after Mogwai),"This disc is a fine effort from a band known more for the death of band member Al Brooker on stage at a festival in Cambridge (UK) than for the music it has produced. That's really a shame. Gwei-Lo were a ""post-rock"" (as if rock no longer existed) hailing from England whose music was profoundly informed by fellow countrymen (Britain, not England, that is) Mogwai - specifically Mogwai's early work (see the singles compilation Ten Rapid). Gwei-Lo is a competent, though not ground-breaking first (and, unfortunately, most likely last) offering."
4,60`s & 70`s TOM JONES,"THE GREATEST HITS FROM HE`S LEGENDARY PERIOD, BUT WHERE ARE: ""LITTLE GREEN APPLES"", ""KISS"" (with ART OF NOISE), & ""SEX BOMB""?, IT WAS A NICE OPPORUNITY TO GIVE US THE TOTAL TOM JONES GOLD, BUT NOW IS MISSED."
5,Good pair,These double bass pedals are great! Had them 3 years and they are still looking and performing good.
5,"My Favorite Album as a Kid, I Still Love It Now.","This was my first album of my very own, and I loved it. Daniel Dolphin in particular stuck in my head, and one day while browsing I remembered it and found it here. What a delight! I still get a huge smile every time I listen to the album. A great buy for a musical child."
2,Not What I Expected,"This book was a bit too graphic for our purposes. I'm pregnant, and I wanted a very basic story of where babies come from to read to our 3 year old son. But this book's pictures were just too graphic, including cutaways of a women's uterus and man's sperm entering, showing a man and woman under the covers, animals mounting each other, etc. This would be appropriate for an older child, but the reviews I read made me think it was appropriate now. Well, not for us."
3,Pleasantly Interesting,"The book How babies are Made, was an interesting book by the way it displayed many different animals with the use of clever illustrations. The topic of Child Birth can be a difficult topic to teach young children, so I do not find it supprising that the author used simple animals and illustrations to try to make it easier for the parents to relate the animals to the children. I did find some of the illustrations a bit confusing, and that is coming from a college student taking a child developement class. Overall for the level of difficulty associated with the topic of child birth, I believe that the book does make a sufficient point to illustrate the nature of child birth, yet some of the illustrations can be confusing so keep that in mind. That is my personal oppinnion and I am a Psychology Major at Cal State Northridge."
4,"Bright colors, subtle pictures and clear explanations","Originally published in 1968 by Time-Life Books, this book hasn't changed either - and it needs no revision to remain up-to-date. It actually addresses ""the birds and the bees"": beginning with flowers, then moving on to chickens, dogs and finally humans, the authors show how reproduction happens in a similar way for all types of living creatures. The brightly colored paper cutout illustrations hold a young child's attention, and keep even the most squeamish parent from being embarrassed."
5,This was the book my mother gave me YEARS ago and i STILL remember it.,"Recently the topic of explaining the birds and the bees came up with some mom friends..and i remembered the book my own mother gave me back around 1970 and checked here to see if it still exists...much to my delight and surprise i found it, and wanted to share my thoughts...now that i have my own 5yo who will benefit from this book.Even though i am 43, i still remember the book and the illustrations..and the easy to understand wording on how babies are made..nothing 'secretive' or 'tantalizing' or anything like that...pretty cut and dry wording with engaging illustrations. i know another review mentioned it being a bit too graphic...these are paper doll cut out types of illustrations and i don't find them intimidating at all..it's not like there is an actual photograph of the inside of a woman's uterus ;-)I give this book 5 stars and will be ordering my copy for my daughter soon."
5,So grateful to have rediscovered this book.,"As I am now looking for a book for my 3 and 5 year old boys, I naively assumed that the book my mother read to me 25 years ago would still be at my local bookstore. The one thing I remembered most about it were the paper cut out illustrations. Thank goodness while reading a recommendation for Joanna Cole's How You Were Bord, the reviewer also mentioned this book, or I might never have found it! Thank you so much! I feel truly blessed."
5,Best food for Koi,we love this food for our koi. they are happy and we now have 2 of them eating from our hand.
4,Excellent Reality Vid!,"From the producers of Cops but, much much better and better picture quaity than Cops vids I have seen. I highly recommend this video to those who love reality vids! Covers: shoot-outs, natural disasters, rescues, mid air plane crashes etc..."
3,"Good poster, bad packaging","The poster was beautiful, however the packaging was not. The seller shipped this in a triangle tube, and did not roll the poster before putting it in the tube, so the poster settled into the corners of the triangle and creased. When I opened the tube, I found a poster that was creased, and looked rather bad when put into a frame...which was meant as a gift. I'm hoping it will flatten out in the frame :-("
3,Mamas & The Papas - 'Gold' (Geffen),"Total of 32 tracks.Decent 2-CD compilation,specially for the price.Sound could be better.There are tunes here that I certainly don't remember.But,who could forget the hits?Most notable cuts include ""Monday,Monday"",""Straight Shooter"",""I Call Your Name"",""California Dreamin'"",""Creeque Alley"",the B-side ""Look Through Any Window"",""The Right Somebody To Love"" among others.Personally,I liked their box set 'Singles,Plus' better(see my review).Good for either the completist of any new fan."
3,Poor Remastering,"Although a great 2 CD collection the sound quality suffers from a bad remaster job. This became evident after comparing this CD to an older best of CD that I bought a number of years ago called ""16 of Their Greatest Hits."" The Gold recordings have the life sucked out them, no warmth and a harsh sound compared to the other compilation. Too bad because this has more depth in song selection."
4,Gold,"Gold being a compilation with The Mamas & The Papas and contains all their major hits like ""Monday, Monday"", ""Dedicated to the one I love"" and ""California Dreammin'"". The Mamas & The Papas played a mix of folk rock, psychedelic rock and sunshine pop. The booklet contains many great photographs of the band and linernotes written by Billy Altman. 4/5."
4,Book for Amazon Kindle,"This is an interesting book. Have not finished it yet. I do like Cara Neggars. Pluto ""Book Hound"""
2,I feel very different,"I guess the other reviewers don't know about the better romance authors out there. This book was ridiculously lacking in passion and love. It wasn't intense at all, like some people said. I wanted to like this book, but it was so boring! I could not relate to any of these characters because their feelings were never described. And there was so many other characters that were not important to the main plot. Juliet and Ethan were a bit...cold to each other. I could not feel any spark between them.Then one day he stays over her house. And the next morning she wakes up to the phone ringing, and remembers all the sex they had.They had sex? Really? I don't remember that happening. Why didn't Carla write about this?The book wasn't horrible, but it was definitely not something to rave about, like I thought it would be when I read the reviews."
3,reading Carla Neggars books,it just did not come up to her level of the other books I have read of hers.. I have reccomended her books to friends. I am looking forward to reading her newest book.
1,Lacking any form of life......,"That is the best way to describe this book. The characters are flat and uninteresting. The romances lack any passion. Furthermore, Mailer does a poor job of describing the setting. The book was so poor that I stopped reading it one hundred pages from the end."
3,Another book review,"yeah, this book's pretty good if you like strong characters and no storyline. Its set in the 50s in a desert town populated by rich and powerful Hollywood people, and our hero wanders around getting to know these corrupt, weird and sometimes dangerous characters without anything really happening. But hey, its insightful and written with real verve by Mr Mailer, just don't expect too much from the storyline."
3,"Setting Good, Story Not So Good","It's interesting to see Mailer's take on the Hollywood witchhunts, directors testifying before Congress and forced to name names, and the goings-on of the Hollywood rich and famous. But the first-person framing device is tiresome and cliched, and Mailer has done much much better. Read this if you are a big Mailer fan or love Hollywood in the 50s, otherwise I'd take a pass and move on to greener pastures."
2,ABSOLUTE BOREDOM,"This unfortunate book suffers from an acute case of aphoristic intoxication, evidenced in such pithy morsels as: ""like most cynics he was profoundly sentimetal about sex"" and ""our marriage was the meeting of zero and zero.""Although such modestly entertaining observations kept me plodding along, the book is a lame attempt at armchair beat philosophizing, ensnarled in a wholly unengaging plot and unbelievably boring characters. I first read about this greatest of books in Joe Ezterhas's biography, and it makes sense that he would consider its shallow machisimo the stuff of masterpieces.Avoid this. Reread Day of the Locust. Recommended for only the most die-hard of Hollywood historians or cultural completists."
3,"marion faye deserves his own book, eitel not a page","i was a little disapointed that this book was so much about the world of actors,producers,and directors. i was hoping for more out right debauchary and vice.mostly i think it was focused way to much on the director eitel.i found him less than interesting, i would have thought this book a waste of my time if it wasnt for the burnout spiritual pimp,marion faye.he was the shadow in the background of all the movie people living in the spotlight.this shadow was my light.a book focused on marion would be a book of a god in the shadows.instead this book was focused on a bunch of arrogant show buisness pepople."
4,Medibeads Hand Wrap,This is a good product--however--it is short. I have short hands and I have problems covering my thumb joint as well as the finger joints. It is heavier than I would like--but it is moist heat and it holds the heat well.
4,Hand wrap works exactly as described,I bought two of these hand wraps as it seems the arthritis in my hands hits both of them at once. I heat them at the same time and then sit with my hands inside them until the pain subsides. They are a bit smaller than pictured but worked on me as I don't have large hands.
5,warming up,"Shipped quickly and heats up nicely. I found the mitt too short to cover the thumb and all fingers at the same time. I have short fingers, so this came as a surprise. I kept the product because it is easy to use and gets plenty hot. I wish the end was closed. I purchased it for treating arthritic hands."
2,sort of okay,"Covers only the fingers--that's okay, I knew that from reading other reviews. But it doesn't hold the heat very long, 6-7 minutes max, even after being in the microwave more than a minute and a half. The product is not worth the price."
2,JLO GETTING TO OLD-O?,"I am so sorry, but she has no talent! Its her Butt who gets the glameur! She is too old! A girl on TV even called her a HOE! But that's not my idea, she is just to OLD AND NOT TALENTED!"
3,Cervical Subluxation,"The INFORMEL art movement (1948-1962) was based upon violent gestures (slashed, torn, burned canvases) to break away from conventional abstract art. Thus from its cover art to the music we find ""Bilious Paths"" has evolved into a new expression for Muziq. An abrasive angrier more urban CD it holds a powerful irrational expression. Wanting to move onto new grooves yet afraid to let go of that signature Muziq sound. No pretty melodies to guide you here. Instead electronic mayhem: shouts, scrapings and dense music shocks arranged to a charged geometric disorder. A commendable ambition on Paradinas' part. But indeed difficult for the listener to hold onto. It makes one wonder what fantastic music is in order if he were to just let go and dive into improvised expressionism."
4,welcome back,"Well, three and a half stars actually. Personally I'm happy to see a very talented man releasing a good album among all the crap these days. He's still the master in producing melodies and rhythms that sound perfectly accidental and he's doing it better than Aphex Twin now. The problem is that there's nothing new. He's making the exact type of music he did seven or eight years ago. Nothing evolving, he stays put where he once was although that being a bad thing is arguable anyway.My favourite tracks are the calmer ones with stronger melodic structure, namely 'Octelcogopod' and 'Aec Merlin'.I recommend this album to people who are already familiar with mu-ziq, it's like a warm welcome from an old friend, but if you haven't heard about him before, I suggest you to start with 'In pine effect'."
2,Looking for a good DCOM book? Keep looking.,"Would you trust the technical expertise of a programmer who writes this:if (g_hExitEvent == NULL) assert(false);This book is replete with this and other nuggets of technical prowess.The surrounding text is no better. Thai's English syntax is downright odd. His analogies are frequently tortured or nonsensical. All of this distracts the reader from the technical content.There is high praise for that content from my predecessor reviewers, but I thought his presentation was haphazard and unenlightening.I have found previous O'Reilly books quite good, but they did a very disappointing job on this one."
5,This is an excellent book on COM/DCOM,"Thanks to those previous reviews, I just bought this book, and I came to agree that this is really an excellent book on COM/DCOM. I've learned the ""why & how"" this technology compare to previous proven ones. Not like others which rarely exlain the ""why"", this book leads you through the concepts and applies. Even I'm an experienced software engineer but it still worths it to read the first few chapters...I completed the first two in one sitting. The book layout is also very well organized."
4,the stencils are light cardboard,"I had been hoping the stencils were plastic, but it turns out they're made out of thick paper (or light cardboard, depending on how you look at it). It wouldn't take much to rip them.The book came as recommended to four and up, but I would say five and up. The stencils aren't tough enough for a four year old to use, and they are too difficult for a four year old to cut out.The book consists mainly of the stencils and pattered paper to use the stencils on. The first four pages contain facts about dinosaurs. The last four pages consist of ideas on what to do with the stencils (like a bookmark or decoration for a pen holder)."
2,morrison's worst (worse than invisibles),"this is the worst new x-men volume in grant morrison's run. i almost gave it three stars because the first story-arc has some sick moments (with beak and fly-girl)... but i couldn't do it. first of all, in the first story-arc bishop shows up and you think some hardcore action is gonna come, but it never does...(which isn't really that bad, 'cause the plot is decently suspenseful). BUT then the 2nd story arc comes and its so atrociously bad (art AND writing), that i can't help but give this two stars.this is some of the worst x-men i've read (as bad as claremont when he's bad [which is most of the time])."
1,Relaxor Garment Accessory,"Relaxor AM8THIGH Massager Garment arrived as specified. HOWEVER, in order to operate it, one must order, separately, a compressor unit. This was not apparent when ordering the product. Cannot find compressor on Amazon.com. Therefore, am returning the Massager Garment."
2,Hale,"I am forced to use this text to teach my High School Marine Science class. I find the text oversimplified and the outline does not follow a logical path to organizing this information. The text and illustrations are out dated, frequently using terms no longer in common use. The chapter reviews are shody and do not help to reinforce key concepts."
2,Spout guard good/ Toy organizer worthless,"The spout guard is adorable and functional. The toy organizer will not stay attached to the wall, and will not hold many toys because of the stitching in the middle of the pouch."
5,Cute froggy,I just bought this item and it is too cute. The toy holder stays put and the spout is covered. I love it!
3,It's really cute,The bag is kind of small (good for small baby toys). It doesn't fall off the tub wall (I have sandstone). The spout cover is not good if you have attachments on the spout used to turn on the shower. I have to remove it and replace it when I take my son a bath. Not a big deal.
1,Toy Organizer,"I agree with the other reviewers, this toy holder stays up for about 10 minutes with or without toys in it. Horrible product, don't waste your money."
2,Cute but I would think again.,"I registered for this because it was so cute! I finally got to use it as my little boy if finally old enough to interact with toys and use the ""big boy"" tub. When we started filling the net with toys, the weight would just pull it down. Now don't assume we just loaded this sucker down with toys. We put a rubber ducky (small child size) and some bath time link a doos. Also the spout guard which is adorable, doesn't stay on on all models of faucets. I think the hole is too large in the back. You kinda have to secure it with some strong glue to the tile or stuff it with something to get it more snug against the faucet. We took it back after 8 months of owning it and babies are us actually took it back without a receipt or box. We bought something different(a fish which was even tough to put on so I doubt he will be able to pull it off)and so far so good. Good Luck!"
3,Beware!! Item not as pictured!,"The toy organizer I received is not the same one that is in the picture (which we currently have). I had bought this to replace the one that I have as it was starting to mold (it's a few years old) and I couldn't get it clean anymore. However, when I received the item the frog was completely different. The spout cover doesn't fit my shower fixture so I can't use it. Not that big of a deal since I actually bought it for the organizer but it would have been nice to use had it actually fit. I had to cut the opening of the organizer for the toys to fit and for my kids to be able to get them out easily. I have not had a problem with the organizer staying on my acrylic tub. It does sometimes slide down but it generally stays where I put it. Not worth returning but I would not have bought it had I known it was not as pictured :("
2,Spend More for Lasting Quality,"I bought this earlier this year. The spout cover did not stay on but the kids seemed to like it as a toy. However, the frog toy bag fell off the wall frequently and got really moldy fast. I washed it several times but it never really seemed to get clean. I think something plastic would be much better for toy storage. I will be purchasing something else."
3,Great Large Spout Cover - Horrible Toy Holder,"I bought this for the spout cover mainly. It works wonderfully. I bought it after reading the reviews that is was too big for most faucets. They should advertise that it is for larger faucets. My baby loves it. It has a super cute face that she loves to stare at and laugh at.THE Horrible Toy Holder... I read that no one has been able to get it to stick to their wall. I have had this problem with most of these toy holders, but this is definitely the worst. It wouldn't stick the 1st time we tried to hang it up. It had no toys in it at all. The suction cups are not heavy duty. I plan to look for some better suction cups and replace them."
2,Does NOT stick,"We bought this bath toy organizer several months ago and it has yet to stick to the wall for longer than 20 minutes! The suction cups are horrible. Plus, the mesh is connected in the middle making it pretty difficult to put toys in, especially for my toddler. Larger toys will not fit in on the sides. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it is very cute and my son loved it when we first bought it."
2,It's ok for a while,"It's very difficult to manage all the toys in the bath and I thought this would help. It did for about 2 months then it started to lose its sticking abilities. In addition, the legs of the frog became mildew riddled. I washed it too but it did not all come out. Plus it is kind of small. A helpful hint though, it will stick to glass doors better then a tile wall."
4,Worth the $ for fans...,"This single for Ape Dos Mil is worth the money simply for the enhanced video. The live songs are, to be honest, only fair. they do not capture the intensity of their live set. I personally do not buy singles unless they have good B-sides (I was hoping the would release their cover of Quicksand's ""Dine Alone""...) but this is an exception because of the high regard i hold for this band. A must for fans, but their Cosmo single was much better...Overall - 4.5 stars"
4,Cute,"This is a delaying-bedtime story of the ""what if"" variety. In this one, the what ifs are ""what if various animals come into my room"", with the vigorous and active response.Momma's language is over-the-top in its cutesiness, but that just adds to the fun of the book. This is a more active going-to-bed book, so you should probably read it at the BEGINNING of your bedtime rotation instead of as your last book before lights out."
4,Don't have preconceived ideas,"First, I must say I'm not a long time Anka fan. In fact, I wasn't born when some of his earliest hits were written. I do like interestingly delivered vocal jazz. I think many of those who gave this album low reviews had the originals in mind when they were listening. Imagine that you had never heard these songs before. There are a couple duds, but most of them are well sung with pleasing instrumentation. In my opinion, some are better than the ""Top 40"" sound of many of the originals. Be open minded."
1,not as good as Cheese,"It is an excellent idea to ""swankify"" current hits. Richard Cheese has been doing it for years. I prefer Richard Cheese & Lounge Against the Machine to Paul Anka. If you are a fan of this album I urge you to taste the Cheese. You may find it is Gouda!"
4,Almost As Good.......,"The second of Anka's ""swing cover"" albums stands superbly it's own right and merits, especially for anyone that has not revelled in the delights of his first album under the same genre "" Rock Swings"". Whilst the quality and and the skill in conversion to this increasingly popular genre is not in doubt, the choice of song is not quite as sublime as in the earlier album with such tracks as ""It's My Life"" by Bon Jovi, ""Eye Of The Tiger"" by Survivior and the truely remarkable ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" by Nirvana. Certainly I would advise any fan or lover of this type of music to purchase this superb album and compliment it with it's more sofisticated elder brother "" Rock Swings""."
2,I liked the idea better the first time...,"...when it was done by Richard Cheese. Seriously, if you think this is a good album, you owe it to yourself to check out Richard Cheese. Get down with the Dickness!"
3,Still Cooking!,This most recent Paul Anka recording isn't great; but it isn't bad either! My Way with a surprisingly good Jon Bon Jovi duetting shines and some tunes seem to benefit from the Vegas treatment (Time after Time) but some others are just destroyed and should never be done in this style (Both Sides Now).
2,"Out takes from ""Rock Swings""","This was a very disappointing follow up to Rock Swings. Rock Swings was an amazing record with an unexpected selection of tunes, and nearly every one of them meticulously treated to a terrific swing interpretation. I was hoping for another helping, but alas my strong suspicion is that this album is the tracks that didn't make it on Rock Swings. The only one that could have made it that first album is the first track ""Time After Time,"" and after that it all goes tragically down hill."
2,Come on Paul. You are a Legend. You can do better.,"I am a huge fan of Paul Anka and he surely has created some of the best songs of the last century. HOWEVER this album is soo boring. It could put me to sleep were it not so pretentious. Anka's got the voice and the songs could have been well covered, but the jazzy style he gives to songs such as Against the WInd or Ordinary World is just intolerable.Sorry Mr. Anka. Better luck next time."
1,Richard Cheese Does It Better,"It's sad to say, but Richard Cheese does this type of music better :( I know many people will disagree with me, but that's my opinion.So, spend your money on a Richard Cheese Album. :)"
1,"This is a joke, right?","Please God, let this be a joke...now playing on the loudspeakers at Gitmo...It's PAUL ANKA!"
1,VIVA LA CHEESE!,"I listened to the samples and I have to say I'm not impressed. This guy has some good hits that are worth listening to. But this is as sad as Pat Boone's ""I'm in a metal mood: no more mister nice guy"" album."
5,Fantabuless!!,"I have always loved Paul Anka, but this new album is the best!Great voice, great songs."
3,not the best,"I've listened to him for years, seen him in concert, but this cd left me cold. There's nothing that stands out...just a lot of good songs that he's tried to make unique, but it doesn't work."
2,Dissapointing,"Always looking for new work from Anka.I have been very dissapointed in this new work. Songs are meant to be different, but some things should not be changed.His ""A Body Of Work"" album was his last great effort.I could not get enough of it.Please Paul,do what your fans are used to.Chuck,New York"
1,MY WAY,I guess I expected more I was very disapointed in the vocal aspect of Pauls music.I kept wondering when it would pick up BORING and not my way Give me the old Paul of the 60s.
3,"Well, it's not completely horrible","Yes Virginia, it is a humidifier.As other reviewers said, this is not a sturdy or silent machine. First, the out of box experience - setup is easy once you realize that the edge of the wick is supposed to hook onto a ledge on the back of the cabinet. You'll probably need to press in slightly from behind to un-warp it enough to let the two engage.The water bottles are harder to fill than they probably need to be. They're too tall to stand up under a bathtub faucet and the supplied hose that's supposed to fit over a sink faucet is so tightly kinked that water won't pass through. The best I've been able to manage is to lean them under the tub faucet at a slow trickle.As for the sound - at low, it's fine. At high, it sounds like being on an airplane with the drone of the engines mixed with rushing air white noise. It's not offensive noise, at least - no rattles or squeaks. If the unit is too close to the wall, it gets a bit louder."
1,Junk Humidifier,"This came with a 2 inch piece of tape on the bottom of the shipping box. I don't know how it made it here. We opened it up and it is damaged, of course. The lid will not fit on the product. I am so disappointed in this. Now, what a mess it is going to be to return it, even if we can. Cheap product, I say. Do not buy this item.I should have read these reviews, first."
2,Had some problems,"We had this humidifier for 21 days before it quit working. Before that it worked great, the humidity in our home was more comfortable. However, Amazon made it no problem and sent us a new one in about 4 days. We'll see how this one last. Amazon was great in dealing with them."
4,After a years with it satisfied,Over all this is a good product. Does. Good job just a bit noisy. It is in our main living room so hard to get away from sound.
1,Essick Humidifier - Poor Quality,"As several other reviewers discovered, this product (Essick Air 696-400 humidifier) is lacking in quality. The cabinet is flimsy, the unit is noisy, and the wick is a disaster! Poor engineering from the word GO.The variable speed control causes the motor to hum loudly when used at lower speeds. This hum is amplified by the thin, light-weight, plastic cabinet. When the motor is turned up to higher speeds the fan creates an unacceptable level of noise.The first time I cleaned the wick, following the directions in the owners care & use manual, the paper element began collapsing and would have completely fallen out had I not caught it in time.I seriously regret spending so much money on such an inferior product!"
4,Great for Women with ADD,"I saw this in my sister's place and was intrigued. Unfortunately it seems to be in limited supply on the net, but worth acquiring."
4,Some parts were very helpful.,"I didn't feel a strong connection to Sari Solden or her writing style. I felt much more in touch with the book ""Delivered from Distraction"". The first chapter (I think) of ""Women with Attention Deficit Disorder"" addresses the differences that young girls experience in school, as opposed to young boys. I felt that was the most helpful part of the book.I read the book and gave it to a family member to read. I think it was a good book, but there were numerous grammatical errors, and I had a hard time becoming engrossed in the text. I felt that it didn't describe my ADHD experiences and personality as well as other books that I have read."
3,Barbara in excellent voice!,"Despite the venue this is very much a caberet performance.There is no orchestra, just piano and bass to accompany Barbara Cook. She is in excellent voice but I find the lack of an orchestra a real disappointment. There is also the unnessessary inclusion of Malcolm Gets who has a pleasant enough voice, but not one I want to hear when I put on a Barbara Cook cd. Her rendition of Send In The Clowns is perhaps the best ever, however, the audience appears to be populated by the sick, who insist on coughing at every available moment throughout her tender reading. Another problem is the self indulgent audience who laugh hysterically at every slightly amusing lyric that they've heard a hundred times before. If you want a live Barbara Cook cd, try Live from London or It's Better With A Band."
3,Carnegie Hall review,"Barbara Cook is a fine performer and funny and interesting as a speaker, but too much of this CD was doing just that, speaking...and then there was the applause. I'd rather of had more songs. ON the whole this is a good album since there isn't much opportunity to find her elsewhere and She's really fine even at age seventy. Malcom Guest is a lively companion in the duets, but I was surprised to find a tenor in those parts unless a match was desired since Cooks voice is very strong. He sounds boyish next to her and there's maturity in hers. also she gets tired toward the end. I ca hear it in her voice even her speaking voice. A fine effort though. I""m glad to have it."
5,I Was There -- And This is Close,"Having listened to all her CDs and seen her at at the Hotel Carlyle hotel in NYC, I literally ran to Carnegie Hall to get tickets when this concert was announced. Being there in person was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Even waiting outside on the sidewalk for the doors to open was an experience; the feeling inside the hall was electric. So I eagerly awaited the CD, and it doesn't disappoint. Barbara Cook is a remarkable performer, and this CD shows she's still willing to take risks ... with her choice of guest (Malcolm Gets), her choice of songs, and her willingness to revisit old chestnuts with a new tempo or interpretation. A friend turned to me at the end of ""Bring in the Clowns"" (after he had wiped away his tears) and said ""It's as if I've never heard that song before."" BUY THIS ALBUM!"
1,Tubepre,"If you are international buyer you will buy this item at your OWN RISK. The most important part is that once you lost your POWER SUPPLY it is very hard to replace. At the time I bought this the power supply did not work and right now I have spent over $200 to find the one that suit the item, and I try to order off their web site but it said ""US only"" that's mean if you're not live in US you shouldn't buy this.. I am from Australia and very disappointing that I can't find a right power supply for this"
4,"Neat preamp, change the tube","This is a great starter preamp.When i first started recording i was using an akg perception 200 and tascam 122L. the 122 is a decent interface but is almost too transparent for its own good. All of my vocal recordings sounded lifeless and detached.I purchased this inexpensive preamp and found that it certainly did add the subtle harmonics needed to liven up the tone.I read online that many people thought that while this preamp is decent for the price, merely switching out the stock chinese vacuum tube can really enhance its tone. So I went to G***** C***** and purchased a replacement russian made groove tubes preamp tube and WOW, It really did make a huge difference!(the entire tube switching process took me about 4 minutes, i had never done such a thing before but it was very easy)So while this is a nice little preamp, a simple $20 upgrade took the quality way above and beyond what you get out of the box."
5,Best $100 I Ever Spent,"This tube preamp is amazing. What really makes it shine is the option to send as much or as little input audio through the tube. The effect is the right amount of microphone warmth for each job. The output gain has a really wide range, which means that I can drive the tube hard and still get pleasant audio out of the unit. One more thing - the TUBEPre is quiet, much quieter than anything else in this price class."
5,Hooked me from page one...,"Slipstream has intense, sad, unforgettable characters and a mood and setting you can get lost in. I loved the author's lyrical voice and amazing eye for detail. This is a side of Los Angeles (and the airport) that you don't often see in fiction--no movie stars, no plane crashes, but a narrative and voice that get under your skin and stay with you long after you've finished reading the book. Highly recommended."
5,"Engrossing, literate and a page-turner!","I was surprised to discover this was the author's first published novel. It's very polished and literary with excellent character development and a gripping story. Lots of clever analogies and dark humor. My favorite part is when the Jewell character is working at her school cafeteria and deals with a complaint about the cheese on the omelets: ...Jewell slid the spatula under the omelet like she was slitting a throat. She catapulted it into the garbage behind her, where it landed with the dull thud of a dead body. ""Anything else? Sausage?"" She picked one up with the tongs and held it so the girl could inspect its turd-like profile. ""Look, not a speck of cheese.""... That one made me laugh out loud. Ms. Larson does a great job of getting inside the heads of the male and female characters and scenes like that bring them to life. A great read from a promising writer."
1,Boring,"Maybe I should have given the novel a better chance, but only made it through the first two chapters. A previous reviewer described the work as ""high literature,"" and I have to strongly disagree. The prose seemed unpolished, and ultimately boring. It's certainly not a book that ""grabs"" one from the beginning. I felt the character development inadequate - I didn't get a good feel of who these people were, or a part of their world. It came across to me a collection of cliches, stereotypes. Maybe the book gets better as it goes, but I didn't feel it was worth my time to keep reading. Not enough sense of mystery from the outset."
1,So So,I didn't care for this rambling plot at all. Too much detail trying to get inside everyones minds. I skimmed through much of it trying to get to the big explosive event. It looked like Wylie was the only one that learned a valuable lesson from the whole thing.
1,Pass on this!,"This was a major disappointment. I am a great fan of any ""Vatican"" novel and will read some mediocre stuff to get my fix. This, however, did not reach that standard! It is the first novel I have been tempted to give up when only half-way through. As for the suggestion that a bunch of feminist-minded nuns are trying to change the church, this compliments the book too much. There is a dream story that keeps appearing throughout the story but adds nothing. Page after page of some medieval drivel. Comparisons to Morris West - kidding? You might say I didn't like this one."
2,Overrated and Disappointing,"Based on the raving reviews here and from a friend, I purchased and read this book. I kept reading, waiting for the cliches to give way to whatever people raving about and, frankly, I never found it. It's not a bad book, but everything in it has appeared in other papal conclave-types of novels and usually done somewhat better. If you have not read ""Shoes of the Fisherman,"" ""The Last Conclave,"" and others of the genre, read this and enjoy it. If you have read them, you will probably be disappointed."
1,A Summer Skip It Read,The plot is transparent. The characters are straight out of an HBO movie. The only value to this is the history of the conclave and the Vatican and all of that was better told in Shoes of the Fisherman or even in Angels and Demons. This is simply not a good read - even for the beach.
2,"Only for a long flight to San Jose, CA","Somewhat interesting, but I should have known that there was trouble brewing when I spotted a typographical error in the second paragraph of the dust jacket of the book. The main character's name was mis-spelled. The book reads like a dream...disjointed, rambling, and out of focus...probably best forgotten the next day. Good for a flight across country, but only if you have already read the day-old Tribune that you found at the airport. This book seemed to have been created from the cuttings of the editing floor of another book and stitched together with a very fine piece of twine. Two stars if you have little else to read on your journey."
2,"Not bad, if you skip the climax","This book is a good read throughout, except for the climax. Without divulging the ending, be warned that the justification for the climax is totally insufficient. It was so weak that I checked to be sure that my copy had no missing pages. A major disappointment.Also, you should be advised that there are a couple of especially gruesome scenes, bad enough to burn images into your memory."
3,"Decent Humidifier, but the Air purity is lacking","This product definately lives up to the humidifier side, but I found that it was only decent as an air purifier, not really measuring up to some of Bemis' other fine products."
4,Great Product (but arduous to clean),"We bought this product, as part of our Dr. Weil '8 Weeks to Optimum Health' regimen. And, we really love it. During the winter, when the bedroom gets so dry, the humidifier really does the trick. And, it may be in our heads, but the air really does seem to be cleaner than in the rest of the house.This product has great air quality ratings (HEPA, etc.) relative to other products in its price range, and was easy to set up, etc.Our only gripe is that it is a bit of a pain to clean. You need to take it all apart, etc. However, this may be the case with all of these products, and thus, may just be par for the course.We recommend this product whole-heartedly."
2,"Okay product, except for..","1) it's all plastic2) it's gonna cost you about... per year to keep this machine operating (replacement wick, air filter, and bacteria killing chemicals). that's a great business model for bemis, but not for the consumer. there are other models that humidify without wicks and without the use of chemicals."
5,Ginourmous Koi Food,Our Koi are now Ginourmous eating this food. Our dog loves it too! It is best to use the seasonal food as our fish are picky eaters
3,works great,The item (product) was the same as the description of it. Please review other customers comments to have more info.
3,Chamberlain garage door remote control,"I recently bought this security remote through amazon. Overall, i like this device. It works every time you press the button :)Only disadvantage of this device is that you should be very close to the garage door to make the remote work. It looks like the remote will work only within 6 ft of the door."
4,Great item,"I ordered two of these controls. Battery was dead on one control, once replaced both controls worked right out of the package. Shipping took a little long, for the price, they could have shipped it ups or fedex."
4,Lightly Scented and so gentle,"My Tibetan Terrier is sixteen and she has allergies, including respiratory ones. She is also allergic to oatmeal in shampoos; none in this one. I have to bathe her frequently to remove pollen and dust. The scent is light and doesn't make her sneeze or cough, and it doesn't irritate her eyes. It would be better if it had no scent, but I am very happy with this product."
5,"Great movie, like it better than the origional in many aspects","great animation, liked the new altered story. shinji isnt as much of a pussy anymore, and auska isnt as much of a bitch. i recommend to any evangelion fan"
4,i like,great moviei love the addition of mari and new evasOverall i think this movie is worth the 17 dollars plus thhere is free 2 day shipping
5,Different but still amazing,"I love the original series, watched it as a kid and it is truly the anime that got me into anime's. They do a bunch of changes but its for the better, it moves the story along more rapidly. I do miss the character development of the original but wow is this one beautiful to look at it. If you are a fan of Evangelion then buy it, its amazing."
5,Welcome to the next level,"This movie is Amazing 10 out of 10. If you liked the original you'll love this and those of you new to the Eva or Anime scene will be hooked. Restarting the Eva series not an easy task. 2.22 is took 1.11 to the next level. Sure some changes where made and a new character was added but it doesn't mean the original wasn't great or that it's creator meant it should be this way from the start/original, it`s a new rendition of a classic. I'll be honest some minor parts/scenes aren't as powerful as the original but others take it to a hole new level of awesome. It's like building a house the way you wanted it. It's perfect but then 10 years later he thinks: I kind of wish I did this part a bit differently or I wonder how it would work if this was rearranged a bit. I only hope 3.33 and 4.44 is just as epic if not better. Can't seem to wait the year or so for the next release."
5,Dare we say genius?,"Revisiting Eva after so long and now finding this gem brought to the states, wow what an experience! Just sit back and soak in the ensuing craziness, richly brought to life with some of the best 2d/3d available. Amazing how much the feelings and emotional connections carry over from previous Eva installments. Different storyline, but worth every penny!"
3,mixed feelings,"I wont rate this blu ray based on the movie itself. I won't explain what Evangelion is or what the movie is about. If you want that info, then a review of a BD on Amazon is not the right place. That's only my opinion.First of all, I bought the first movie last year and it was amazing. However when I got this new BD a few days ago, my first impression was completely different, kind of disappointed. I was expecting something better but it was worst.The extra content was average, nothing memorable. The package was poor, the orange outer box is a weak attempt to make something nice. It does not even close !It is bad? No. But compared with the first movie, it is a 3 starts. Anyway, if you buy this, you will get a decent BD of an excellent movie for a good price."
4,Ignore the dubbed version.,"How anybody can see any Japanese Animé dubbed into poor English is beyond me. Just watch the subbed version to get the full effect, the nuances, the subtlety. The dubbed version is as poor and dead-flat sounding as ever. At least, if you watch the subbed version and you miss some of the picture due to all the reading that you have to do - hey, you can watch it again and again!!!! Otherwise, the transfer is excellent, and the film MUST be watched on Blu-Ray, there is no other way."
1,And here I thought Akira Toriyma was bad..,"Surprised no one pointed this out : Hideaki Anno is a plagiarist. Evangelion is a blatant, and I mean BLATANT, rip-off of ""Mobile Suit Gundam"", the original Gundam series. Rip-off.Shinji (original name) is a lame attempt at recreating Amuro Ray. A young boy being forced into the military to fight off bad people? Yeah, rip-off. The robots are the poorman's Mobile Suit. Pathetic.The storyline? What storyline? The series simply doesn't make sense -- and don't tell me that I don't ""understand"" it. It makes no sense.Gainax has single-handedly ruined Anime and they continue to do so. We went from the great Speed Racer to this garbage, this uninspired garbage. From Gurren Lagann to FLCL. (Speaking of those two, Gainax's consistency of putting underaged characters in ""sexual situations"" is questionable.) It all sucks."
5,Even Better than the First,"This movie is amazing, and is where things begin to change from the original anime. The introduction of Mari's character and the interactions between known characters begins to build the story in a new and interesting direction.The visuals are even better than the first movie, and the ending leaves you waiting with bated breath for the third movie.100% worth the purchase!"
5,Great movie,"Great movie, can't wait the next chapter, only the blu ray box could be better, like box the previous movie."
5,Excellent reinterpretation,"This is an excellent mashup of the original series, the manga, and a little something new. Effectively wraps up to perhaps episode 25' of End of Evangelion, so looking forward to the next two, if they ever get made. Not sure how they couldn't."
4,Great movie,"It is really an amazing retake of the original Evangelion series, the quality is great, and there is a lot of info in the booklet, the only downside was that, the box have some little scratchs,(the cartoon one) but in regards to the movie itself, no complains."
5,2.0 is Right,"With the new Evagelion created using CGI animated graphics to create both cell style and 3D style animation the appeal is clear that this set to be four part set will be one to remember with stunning visuals that bring to light all the history and vitality we fans have come to want and expect from the series without simply re-watching a remaster. A pure reinvention and it shows with the introduction of new cast and the unexpected loss of others.I found it worth owning because I own the whole original and while I love every moment of the first it can be slow at times and award. The first two movies left me feeling very uneasy and a bit disturbed in points where as these remind me of the golden days of the show bringing to life that great part that made the show work.Action, drama, excitement, emotion, a boy trying to find his way in the world despite all the difficulties he's been thrown. Political upheaval and fear of utter annihilation at any moment from the angels."
5,Amazing,"The movie is simply amazing to put it shortly.Lacks extra's and the packaging is inconsistent with 1.11, a bunch of orange flakes came off my cardboard sleeve."
4,2.22,"Foremost, i enjoyed the tv series: so I am biased. The english dub isn't bad--better than the series--but oftentimes i found myself wanting a gut-wrenching scream: or just a whimper... Nothing. The movie follows a different timeline than series, though and that's its best strength and, in some ways, its worst weakness."
4,Man can imagine states of existence other than they are.,"The first verse of William Blake's Auguries of Innocence appears in Bronowski, as homage to Ludwig Boltzmann: "" To see a World in a Grain of Sand, And a Heaven in a Wild flower, Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand, And Eternity in an hour...."" William Blake was born in London in 1757. He attended drawing school and thereafter eked out a very modest existence as an engraver and artist. He was not able to find a publisher so in 1789 he himself engraved and published Songs of Innocence and The Book of Thel. Blake died in 1827. Blake was one of many 'romantic poets' of that epoch. Auden and Pearson point out that the romantic definition of man appears towards the end of the eighteenth century. The divine element that man possesses is not power nor free will of reason, but self-consciousness. Man can see possibilities, he can imagine states of existence other than they are."
5,"Once I began, I could not put it down...","The writing is excellent..Her unique writing style includes bits of wisdom sprinkled throughout...""A simple, 'I'm sorry I hurt you"" is an amazing human bandage that heals very fast when applied sincerely..A light read that leaves you feeling ""Empowered"" and ready to tackle any issue...Smile..Be Happy.. this is your guide to the Real World!Just read it and enjoy!"
4,"Johnny Pacheco and Pete ""Conde"" Rodriguez celebrate Fania Records' 25th anniversary with this superb Salsa set.","""El Tumbaito"", ""Dame Un Traguito"", ""Esa Mujer"", ""Cuentos Marinos"" and ""Sin Fe"" are your reasons for getting this CD. It may have been released in 1989 but most of its songs sound like they were recorded in the early 1980s and both Johnny and Pete remain true to the Conjunto/Tipico sound which made their 1970s and early 1980s recordings so special. This CD probably slipped under the radar and went unnoticed by most people because of the many changes Salsa was undergoing at the time of its release and also because Fania Records was in no position to properly market or promote it. If you can find this CD at a reasonable price, I would say that it's a worthwhile addition for your Salsa collection."
5,Love it Love it Love it!,"This is my favorite Leslie DVD. I got it on the recommendation of a friend who also uses the walking videos. I mentioned that I have WATP and Express but I found that I was getting really antsy at the 2 mile mark because I was bored. She said this video really mixes it up, throws in a few different moves and the music is louder. She was right, I love this DVD workout. The second mile seems long and your heart rate gets right up there, and I like that Mary Kate gets to lead, it is a nice change. I also downloaded the .mp3 music files for Leslie's 3 mile workout that is designed to be used with a treadmill or on your own. I turn the sound down on WATP/Express and play the music instead and its like a new workout (and I'm more motivated). Overall, this is a terrific video."
4,"Really good workout, pretty good music","Good moves, can go fast at times. Like the music, but I wish she would add more variety to her music. She uses the same stuff in many of her dvds.Mary Kay's mile is good. She does the 2nd mile.Definitely a good buy, think you'll be happy."
4,3 mile weight loss walk,"Good pace, good warmup, good cool down. Great bell curve, with intensity in the middle. All in all a very good walking video."
2,Good but annoying work out,"This one is a bit disorganized. especially the second mile when Mary Kate led the group. Leslie just couldnt be quiet and let Mary do it - she was EXTREMELY distracting with her talks and childish acts. The work out is good - but Leslie is VERY VERY VERY annoying in the 2nd mile. Plan to return the DVD as i dont think I can go thru it again. Also, it seemed that either Vance was having a bad day or he wasnt happy to be there - it was de-motivating to see him almost sulk. I am an advanced walker and this was a good sweat - but still plan to return it."
4,A Real Work-out,"This is a fun tape and Mile 2, where Mary Kay leads us in speed-walking, is quite a challenge. It's a nice change of pace."
5,Great for all ages,"I ordered this DVD for a birthday gift for my sister-in-law, who is in her late 60s. We have had our DVD for over 6 months now, and it was a Godsend to us this past winter. There were many snowy and rainy & cold days. My husband and I are both in our 70s and love to get out and walk as our main source of daily exercise, usually walking 3-4 miles a day in good weather. I love the friendly fun routines that never are boring, and never too hard for us, giving us the cardio workout and strength and balance training we both need. We usually work out 45 minutes 6 days a week, and Leslie & her group are a great inspiration. I can certainly recommend this DVD for daily exercise. We have several other DVDs that Leslie has on the market; most of them are better suited to younger walkers."
4,Very Good Workout!!!,"I like this video, the only thing I did not like was Leslie talking and joking so much. I thought it was rude when Mary Kate was teaching and all Leslie was doing was trying to have conversations with everyone,other wise the workout is great."
5,Leslie Sansone :3 mile weight loss walk,I currently own at least 18 Leslie Sansone exercise tapes and I love each and every one of them! This new one is so upbeat and I truly feel like I've completed a good workout when I've finished. Thank you Leslie!
5,Great work out,"I started with Leslie's one mile workout then I purchased this one. It is great. Who knew you could get such a great work out in your own home. It is simple and easy to follow. I would recommend this to anyone. Great, great workout!"
4,walk walk walk,"Good basic workout, not too tough! I liked how there are real people in her video that have lost weight walking. This is the first one I have tried and I am happy with it."
2,"Walk ""ON"" the Pounds!","I own about 15 of Leslie's workouts, and this one is my least favorite for several reasons. It is not challenging; I barely work up a sweat. The music is not well organized, and there are always gaps of silence between songs. But, what bothers me more than anything is that Mary Kay appears to have gained about 50 pounds since the last video. I cannot seem to focus on anything in this tape other than her obesity. Seeing her makes me realize that this exercise program is not effective for everyone. Mary Kay teaches this program, yet she has gained a substantial amount of weight. Seeing her in this video has prompted me to search for new workout programs. Furthermore, Leslie cannot stand to simply walk and allow Mary Kay to lead the second mile. She is constantly doing things behind Mary Kay's back to draw attention to herself. It's very annoying. Finally, poor Mary Kay is dressed in drab gray and black. They could not have made her look worse if they have tried."
5,It's possible to power walk with arthritic hips!,"Last year I was diagnosed with arthritis in both hips. Shortly after, I had to stop my walking because of the pain. As a former power walker, 5 days a week, 3 miles/45 min., I have greatly missed my walks, until recently. After almost 4 weeks of walking with Leslie, I am back to the great feeling of accomplishment that I'm doing something good for my body and mind. I still have some pain, but walking in-place replaces the different elevations that caused a lot of the pain. While walking with Leslie, I'm able to get a bit more exercise, by ""pumping up"" my upper body movements along with vigorous walking.I will be enjoying this dvd for a long time to come. After my eventual hip replacement surgery, I know I will be once again walking with Leslie and crew!Alexandra GlasgowAcworth, Ga."
5,great motivator!,"Leslie is a great motivator, and this walking tape is no exception. After I get used to it, I often pop in a ""recorded book,"" or a CD of some other music and watch the DVD on the screen with no sound. Just watching her and the other walkers and matching their pace helps me achieve my 3 mile, or 2 mile, depending on how I feel!"
5,Great morning workout!,"I really like to use this DVD as my morning routine... very convenient since I can choose between 1, 2 or 3 miles depending on the time I have available."
5,You Go Girls!!!,"You go girls! This dvd is one of Leslie's finest and I own a stack of them! Mary Kay!--You are the bomb girl!! I absolutely love the 2nd mile that is led by Leslie's sister, Mary Kay! Boy, is she high energy! Mary Kay should also do dvds--I'd buy them!! I have had such success with Leslie's workouts! My body has shrunken after childbirth--and I'm not starving either! Please do more like this one!"
4,It's good exercise especially for intermediate,I love this video as is combine both aerobic exercise and strength training in 3 mile walk. It's especially good for intermediate level. Leslie's exercise series have not disappoint me! Start walking and be healthy!
4,does one need a treadmill or any tool?,"hi, this is really not a review but a question - hope someone could answer it.i don't quite understand the idea of ""walking"" at home. on a treadmill? please if someone could explain to me, that'd be great, thanks.and sorry i had to make up a rating..."
4,Love Walking,"I have been a walker with Leslie off and on for several years. This is my favorite DVD by Leslie. She uses two pound hand weights during this walk. I like to walk five miles, so I repeat miles one and two before moving on the to third. In my opinion the entire first mile is a warm-up so I up the intensity by adding three pound weights to each ankle. The second mile by Mary Kay is intense but, I keep the weights on for it as well as for the third mile. Additionally, I use five pound hand weights. If I could change a couple of things, (1) Leslie would use the hand weights for the entire first mile and (2) this would have been a five mile walk. I'm rating it four stars because of these two things."
5,"Great for beginners, sedentary people getting active again","The most important thing to remember with any of Leslie's DVDs is that you do NOT have to do the arm movements or use the weights when you are beginning. I believe this is an excellent way for sedentary people to get active again. You can gradually increase your movement by adding the arm movements as you get more fit. Ultimately, add the weights. I love the third mile that uses lots of weights movements for the arms. I have added it to other miles from Leslie's other DVDs to form my own custom workout.I literally thank God every single day for bringing Leslie's DVDs and the Wii Fit program into my life."
2,Sorry...I don't like it!,I have over a dozen of Leslie Sansone workout DVD's. This one was very disappointing! The 2nd mile was good. The 3rd mile was so slow I felt like I was going to trip over my own feet. Less time was taken for the 3rd (the slow mile) than the 2nd mile (the fast one).
5,Excellent Leslie Workout DVD!,"After reading the many positive reviews of Leslie Sansone's 3 Mile Weight Loss Walk DVD, I decided to order it and check it out for myself. I'm very glad I did! This DVD is one of my favorite Leslie DVDs and I can get through the first two miles with no problem. However, I wish there were an actual cool-down segment instead of just the quick stretch at the end. After working through two miles, I have to cool myself down before doing the stretch at the end. The set is nice and the exercisers are motivating - two of them lost 100 pounds and one lost 70 pounds. A nice incentive!"
5,Great Workout.,"This is one of Leslie's BEST video's I have. Good workout, gets right into the joints. Easy to do for those that have had serious back, neck and knee injuries."
5,"love it, especially Mary Kay's mile.",I love this dvd expecially Mary Kay's mile. The second music is a hit for me it could not be any better I just love it and I do this mile three times then mile 1. When ever I use this dvd I do Mary Kay's mile first.
5,Fun and the best video yet!,"I love this video! I own a few of Leslie Sansone's video's and I love that she's human! She's always upbeat, informative, and has a sense of humor. This video is my favorite out of all the ones I own. I love the music, the people, and the setting. I love that with Leslie's workouts I can make the workout more or less intense if I chose. I live on the second floor and I needed a workout that I wasn't going to do a lot of hopping or jumping and this workout is perfect. I'm almost thinking about giving up walking outside b/c there is no way I can get as good of a workout as I do with Leslie's workouts. Also the moves are so simple and fun!"
5,a much needed Georgian grammar,"I agree pretty much with the other reviewers. This is an excellent and thorough reference work on Georgian grammar. I prefer it to the Hewitt book on Georgian grammar. However as a book by which the beginning student can learn Georgian I have some reservations. This is in no way a ""teach yourself Georgian"" type book. Georgian grammar (particularly the verb) is quite complicated and to learn it one really needs a Georgian teacher with this book as a useful supplement. When I first got this book in 1999 it came with some cassettes. I don't know if those are still available."
3,"Really old, but only recently becoming outdated.","This is the 1931 Geitler book on Cyanobacteria that was THE standard for identification of these organisms for 50-60 years. It is written entirely in German, and most or all of the other identification references that appeared during that time were simply translations of this work. Recent changes in classification due to the advent of microbiological methods have rendered part of this work outdated, but it is still very useful if one intends to attempt identification to the species level, or to make some sense out of older cyanobacteriological literature. It may still be considered up-to-date by those who approach cyanobacteriology from the Botanical standpoint, but that approach is gradually going out of style for bacteria studies."
2,"Great to make techno mixes, but poor in other areas","I'm a web designer and I work with Flash, and I was looking for sounds I could use for sites. It claims to have lots of button sounds but I'm yet to find some. The .wav files are named with numbers, so there no way to search with keywords. You have to explore the CD and listen to each .wav file not knowing what you will get.But, it is great for making your own techno mixes. You can take bass loops, drum loops ect and mix them together and ajust the levels etc.I guess the search is still on for sofware or a site to provide me with lots of cool sounds for buttons, mouseovers, etc."
4,Beginners thru intermediate furniture building,"Get the DVD as opposed to the book.I am a real beginner. After watching this DVD, I think I could actually produce an interesting item of furniture. Doug gives you several projects, both tables and seating, in rustic and twig styles. His manner is informal and friendly. It's as if you dropped by his place on a Sat. and hung around with him while he showed you how to make stuff. He explains things in a clear, easy to understand way and gives you tips about woodworking that will be handy as your skill level improves. Most of the projects don't require more tools than the average garage would have on hand."
4,Just what I was looking for,"Gave me alot of ideas and plans for me, someone with a basic skill level to be successful on my first try at a rustic table. Color photos, and easy to follow plans."
4,More from the Enchanted World Series,"This book is similar in appearance, style, and presentation to other volumes in the Time-Life Enchanted World series, but contains content focusing on yet another creature of myth and fantasy: the dwarf. As with other Enchanted World volumes, ""Dwarfs"" contains numerous color illustrations that make it an aesthetically pleasing book. While the text is likely not detailed enough for use as source material for academia, it IS an informative, introductory read for those unfamiliar with the fantasy genre, and even those well-versed in myth or fantasy are likely to find some interesting information between the covers of this book."
2,Not worth the price.,"I was really excited about this show from the previews. It did not, however, live up to my expectations. Sure, there was a lot of violence, but that didn't really get real until episode 6 or so. Character development was weak. The creators tried to put in bunch of plot twists or tried to cram too much into 12 episodes, but the result was a hurried, sloppy story with little resolution or explanation.If you're down with 12 episodes of a kid crying about how he can never do anything and his strange crush/brother-sister relationship with a mentally handicapped girl, then you might justify the $40-60 pricetag. Personally, I don't think it was worth it, and won't pay full price for subsequent seasons, should there be any."
4,Great set and cover art but is not uncensored!,The product is great I enjoy watching this one. It is a little paranormal/science fiction/horror/fantasy/action/drama/romance/suspense. I love my dead man wonderland set. But it is not uncensored not completely. The introduction is not uncut and there are scenes that are not fully uncut. I should know I have seen some of the uncut episodes online. Overall 4 stars.
5,Simply Awesome!,"I beg you to find a better system for the price. I did a lot of research on Ultra-Mini and Micro CD stereo systems before I took the chance of ordering this online. I think I found the best sound out there! Especially for the amazing Amazon.com price. I tested micro systems at electonics stores that were upwards of three times the price. The sound clarity of the AWIA is every bit as good... if not better! And, it looks very classy to boot! The speakers have a beautiful gloss coated walnut finish. It's also very easy to use. To sum it up, the XR-M75 offers awesome sound, all the perfect funtions and great looks. I'm considering buying one for my wife's office too!"
5,Aaron C.,This is a great system for the price. I bought this for my office at work to replace my ageing boom box and couldn't believe the difference in sound. The sound is almost as good as my Hi-Fi setup at home yet at 1/10th the price. Another great part is how compact the system is and it still has all the features you could ask for. Several people at work who have bought more expensive stereos for their office have commented on how they wished they would have saved some money and bought this stereo instead.
1,Un-heroic hero,"I had hoped a learning-challenged protagonist would be a great example for my son. I had hoped the Hank Zipzer books would be hilarious and inclusive, proving that no matter what personality or learning pattern you have, you can be the hero of the story. I have been sadly disappointed. If the disparaging remarks made about almost every character in the book (smart kids, teachers, even bullies) are what make a person a hero, I'd rather my son find another hero. I am a book lover and have no problem with unconventional and authority challenging books (the Captain Underpants series, for instance), but I am literally throwing these books in the trash."
4,Explosive fun,"What kind of trouble can Hank Zipzer get into when his school is hosting a multi-cultural day? All kinds. In this segment of the adventures of Hank, his friends and family the Zipzers, are selected to host a visiting international student. Yoshi Morimoto and his Father are from PS87's sister school in Tokyo and are visiting schools in America. The visit coincides with PS87's multicultural day.The problems begin when the gang, Hank, Frankie, Ashley and Yoshi try to make enchiladas and the task of reading the recipe falls on Hank. With his dyslexia he struggles with the fractions, and the enchiladas end up with a lot of zing. Once again Hank learns that telling the truth is the best way to go. A good story in a great series."
3,Well...,"She WAS made in 1993, so I guess that explains her quality. I'm not saying she's cheap, but I do think that something could have been added to her to make her more unique. I only play with her as the mother of a baby plush platypus I own, otherwise she is simply not that desirable. Considering the bright, colorful, well-posed Beanies out today, I can't much say I recommend her."
3,Ignore graphics in Chapter 4,"In spite of the screen shots in Chapter 4, all of which are in the wrong place, I found this book to be very clearly written, informative with lots of great links. If you can't stomach the thought of flipping back 3 or 4 pages for every screen shot in chapter 4 trying to find the correct graphic that goes with the text, you should probably wait for an updated edition. Personally, I completely ignored the pictures and focused on the text.A- for content.F for the editor."
3,Not a bad robot - but what are they thinking???,"As far as a toy robot goes it's not bad. The smaller pair of arms are relatively immobile and the welder claw has no utility at all other than as a pretend gun. My big concern here is that Lego (which produces some of the best toys on the market) is going to lose their shirt on this one. Did they actually WATCH the show? It's BAD! Not the good kind of bad either, it stinks! ..."
4,Fun for kids and dads,"My four year old son received this for Christmas and loves it. The parts are big enough so they don't get lost easily. It's just fun trying to make as many combinations as possible. Get some more figures from the Galidor collection (we have every single one)and the combinations are incredible and provide hours of fun. By the way, we enjoy watching the show on t.v."
4,Quiet....????,"Some say that one blade is more or less loud than another. (Shouting) I SUSPECT THIS IS TRUE BUT, DUE TO EXPOSURE TO EXCESSIVE JOBSITE NOISE AS A FACT OF LIFE FOR WAY TOO LONG I can't really tell anymore.I can tell you that this blade cuts almost as smooth as glass on cypress, which is a pretty finicky wood for that sort of thing."
3,for diehard beefheart fans only,"This is not vintage Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band, it is okay, some of it is really good, but not great. I have heard MUCH better live recordings from them (Mirror Man Sessions, for one is SO MUCH better), they were one of the BEST live bands to perform in concert. The sound quality on this recording is TERRIBLE. I love Captain Beefheart's music, I listen to this CD, BUT it is not one of his best."
5,Very good product.,I am a tea drinker and this is a wonderful addition to my cup of tea. I let other friends try it and they all wanted more.
5,Very good tea,I don't see any problem with this product. It's very good and very strong (concentrated).
4,Ginger Drink,Love the product. Too expensive to ship. Probably won't get it again because of the added cost.
3,Might as well get a Dual Zone sensor,"This I thought would be a great thing to get because I thought it would work like a field/motion/proximity sensor. Maybe like the Dual Zone sensor that I saw advertised. But I was very inexperienced and even some of the auto technicians didnt know what it was for because they're used to using the proximity sensors.. Well the price was cheap so I went for it and I guess I didnt know how to test it for functionality. It might only work with windows up and if someone is able to either open your door or break your window, but I figure a shock sensor and door sensor would recognize that. I disconnected mine and ended up getting a proximity sensor. Put I ended up disconnecting that too because it's either too sensitive or not sensitive enough."
3,Not worth the cost.,I bought a pair of these gloves and the 1st day on the slope I regretted it.Positive:- They will hold up to light rain/sleet/wet snow- They will hold up to sweat- They do feel warm if temp is near/above freezingNegative:- A stiff breeze makes my hands cold.- After a while out in rainy conditions your hands will be wet- In below freezing temps my hands were coldSummary:Buy a cheaper gore-tex glove. The extra money does not buy you anything here.
3,Just another bear,"He's cute and he's soft, but he's just another bear. How much fun is that. We just got him on the weekend, and didn't realize he was retired. My kid loves them so I guess we will keep buying them but personally I don't care for the multicoloured fur animals."
2,"Great for Mom, but of little interest to a child","With a few exceptions, beanies seem to be more interesting to adults these days than to children. My 12-year old son enjoys beanies with me -- as a collector. He has a few favorites that he has selected for his room, but they sit on a shelf."
5,Peace Bear is the grooviest!,"Peace Bear's tie-dyed material make him appear authentic in relating to the era of the 60's. The peace symbol embroidered on his tie-dyed chest gives the younger generation an idea of the spirit of the period. I would rate him in the top ten of the most fun beanie babies. He is the grooviest! My personal Peace Bear is displayed next to a hippie that was manufactured in the early 70's and the two of them are quite a pair. The hippie is posed wearing his peace medallion around his neck, and Peace Bear is ""out-a-site"" wearing his John Lennon shades."
3,Not what you think.,Item looks great however the teeth are not machined as part of the pulley. They are created by formed strip of metal wrapped around inside of pulley. Durability of teeth and belt is unknown.
4,cheaper at retail store,this is a cool keychain. alittle big to fit in my pants pocket. i have it displayed along side optimus prime. it is cheaper in the stores. i would recomend buying it at any local chain dept. store such as wal-mart or target. still all in all im happy with this toy.
3,Didn't work for me!,"I have a Sears opener manufactured in 1991. There is a RED learn light on the back. The narrative for this remote stated that it works on a red learn light. This one does not work on my opener. Therefore even though this device may be the cat's meow, it doesn't work for me. If it had worked, I would have been delighted."
3,Check Compatibility with Your Opener,"We learned after receiving this item that it is not compatible with new Chamberlain openers. At least the one we received is not. We have sent a note to Ace Hardware, who sold ours, to see if an updated remote is available in the same style.Until the description text is updated to reflect compatibility requirements for the unit you will receive, I recommend not ordering unless you get an explicit assurance from the seller. Provide the model number of your opener and insist they check the remote that will be shipped."
5,Liftmaster 970LM keychain garage door opener Security +,"This product is fantastic. It is easy to program and use with the enclosed instructions, and attaches to your key chain if desired. It is the same size as an automobile remote control. We ordered 2 of them so that we wouldn't have to use the large clip-on individual openers for our doors, which fall off the visors and can easily be lost. Another great advantage to this product is that potential thieves won't see the opener in your vehicle, break into your vehicle, find your personal information, then head to your residence and easily break in and help themselves to your valuable belongings."
5,Remote Control Garage Opener,This is an excellent remote garage door opener. Very compact and the price was much better than if I bought it at Sears.
5,Sears Replacement Garage Door Opener,"I looked up the door openers and Sears wanted $40 for their's. We had one, but it died just outside of warranty. After looking it up I found who makes the Sears unit and ordered 2 replacement units for the price Sears wanted for one. It's smaller than the Sears unit and works great!"
4,It is what it is..................... a remote.,"Amazon Rocks as a seller!! It isn't exceptional (that would be a five). It works well, seems solid and therefore not a 3 but a 4."
4,LiftMaster Mini remote,"This remote was easy to setup, easy to use. I wished it would be able to turn on and off the overhead lights, but that is a small inconvenience compared to how small this unit is...I keep it on my keyring for my motorcycle and it works great!"
1,Be sure you know how old your garage opener is.,"The item description did not mention which years were compatible with this opener. Only when I received it, and it didn't work, did I go into the reviews. At that point, I saw someone else had the same problem. Know before you buy."
1,Bad deal,"Bought a replacement Transmitter and receiver system from AAA remotes, CA . Problem was the Liftmaste 9* serie transmitters is that they work on 390 MHz and that frequency is currently jammed by the military and the range of the transmitter gets very small that you have to touch the door before it recognizes the signal. AAA remotes is aware of this and keeps on advertising the 9* series as an good replacement system and does not put any disclaimers near the 9* serie products. AAA remotes did not want to replace/exchange for the 315 Mhz models. They really horrible at their customer service and this policy. I definetly recommend never buy from this organization."
5,Works...,"They actually shipped me a different make/model remote, which freaked me out at first. But it still worked w/ my Chamberlain. Works perfectly on my keychain for riding my bike. Small and compact in the pocket."
5,Works well,"it is small, light, and it works reliably opening my garage door from at least 50-80 feet. That's what is is supposed to do. This is after 1 month, no judge yet of longevity."
5,Perfect for Jeep!,"Easy set up! We have a Jeep Wrangler and take off the windows during the summer. Having our garage door opener as the key ring takes away all chance of it disappearing while hiking. shopping or in front of the house. Small as a car door opener keyring, this is great for us!"
5,key-chain transmitter model 970LM,A very handy device to have when you find yourself carpooling and it eliminates leaving the garage door opener in your other car.
4,Great Product,I received the product in the morning and was able to have it working properly within a few minutes of opening it. Instructions were very straightforward and easy to read. I'd recommend this remote to anyone who has the proper garage door opener.
5,Works like it Should,We bought this for my wife to use. I use the car and she rides her bike from work with our daughter. She needed this so she could open the garage door and just ride straight in to the garage. It was easy to program and works great. Very small and very light. Good product!
4,Product is good but merchant instructions mis-leading,"Chamberlain Mini 3-Button Remote Control 956CBShipping and delivery was really fast and received the product within 3 days or ordering. I also called up the merchant and was able to speak to someone directly.I ordered both the key chain and 971LM version. Both of them took a few seconds to program, almost instantly with my LiftMaster Security+ Garage.The product worked like a charm. I have now owned it for a month and have had no problem with the product.I would have given it 5 stars except the shipping instructions from the merchant was misleading. It mentioned the first product ordered from the merchant would be $3.15 and additional item for $1.75, but was charged $6.30 for both that I ordered. Not a big deal, but would have preferred this was mentioned during purchase."
2,Not a happy camper,"First, AAAremotes was late with the shipping. In the meantime, their customer service was nonhelpful. When I received the opener, it work for a total of 3 hours before it quit on me. I would not order from them again."
5,remote,"got it on time and it works great, the remote was bought on amason and it beats all other prices"
2,"DIFFERENT, BUT FOR THE COLLECTOR","INTERESTING MIX OF KISS CUTS, IMMEDIATELY I REALIZED ""NOT"" SUNG BY KISS. A COLLECTOR WOULD ENJOY IN HIS COLLECTION ANYWAY."
4,A good read,"Although this book isn't so exciting that you'll stay up late finishing it, it has a nice flow and tug that just pulls you deeper and deeper into the story. It explains aspects of the Japanese culture that foreigners (particularly Americans) are completely cluess about. It also presents enough ideas that stimulate the brain so that you keep pondering some of the issues days, even weeks, after reading the last page.The weakness of the book, however, is the character development. The main character, Etsuko, is an exception to this and towards the end of the book Chie develops more as well. But the character from the 3rd generation, Hanae, could be explored so much more than she is that the reader is left with some major questions about her motivations and dreams. The same is true of some other characters, more minor but still important to the story.Despite this fault the book is a good read and I would recommend it."
5,Amazing Book,"I recently visited the south of Japan. This book not only told a touching story, it helped explain so many questions I had after my visit. I loved this book, will read it over and over, and hope this author writes more."
5,Cool Ness,"well to tell you guys the truth. im not really into reading but this book by lydia made me want to read. the interesting thing about the book that i thought was how she related to seattle. since im not really from seattle i thought it would be interesting to find out some things about it. also i liked the way she made her characters do so many things in such a small time period. Today i got the pleasure of meeting her in my English 101 class. She is a very briliant and interesting person she had many fasinating things to talk about. The only thing that i want is for her to write some sort of a sequal. Because noone really knows what exactly happens to any of the charaters after the story has ended. But i really enjoyed this book and i recomend this ""I story"" to anyone who likes to read. Even if you dont enjoy reading you will like this wonderful novel. Plus she is a wonderful woman...AND I GOT MY BOOK SIGNED:)"
1,A PIECE OF JUNK DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"the brush does not spin,just gently vibrates.It is not waterproff.The water leaks into the battery compartment.TOTAL RIPOFF...."
3,If the Three Stooges played heavy metal...,"... it might sound like this! In September 2003, during the month-long celebration of John Zorn's music, Zorn staged one of his wildest game pieces: Locus Solus. Twenty years earlier, he came up with the idea --- Zorn, a drummer, and one other musician improvise hardcore rock and roll. There are no rules. The music is fast, loud, and chaotic. The lyrics are made up on the spot. Nothing is repeated or written down.Locus Solus would be a self-indulgent waste if these guys were serious about it. But it's all for fun. On this CD, Zorn teams up with Anton Fier (drums) and Arto Lindsay (guitar and vocals). They make the audience laugh as they hammer away, screech, and babble. The moment they start to lock together into a groove of some kind, they skitter away and start improvising in a new direction. It's frustrating but fun. If you've never heard Zorn before, don't start here. If you want something completely crazy and loud, this is your album."
1,Birthday recording?,"Ok John Zorn is very very talented and he has tried our patience with a lot of really hard-core stuff but this is really dismal. He should be ashamed of himself. Even Arto Lindsay, after years of tasteful music has returned to the horrble stuff he did with DNA. Avoid."
1,nother piece of junk,really disappointed by this product..to actually get the spray you have to really ramp up pressure so the plants are wiped out by the pressure..stupid set up..could a part be missing?
4,office review,Mostly very good. Would recommend it. One must really practice the lessons and try to figure out the program.
5,A Great Book!!!,"This well written books follows nine year old David and his best friend, Georgie, through their once a week karate classes. Young readers will learn that a dojo is the name for the studio, an obi is the color belt worn and that a senei is a teacher. Blocking, sparring, punching are taught with respect for your opponent. The books ends with David and Georgie taking and passing their green belt tests. This is a great first look at a karate class for children. It would be good for parents to buy for a child, boy OR girl, who is thinking about join this wonderful sport."
5,Great Product,"I love this camera, I use it alot and think it is fantastic. Love the features and the ease of use."
2,"Great Camera, but storage isn't","Great camera. Great pictures. But -- the storage is terrible! A floppy disk can hold only so many images... AND it'll hold only ONE megapixel image. There are better soloutions out there. CompactFlash cards can hold 64MB of images, at the least. Iomega Clik! for Digital Cameras drives can hold 40MB of imagery. And, floppy disks are expensive. I highly reccomend this for novices, but for serious photographers, stay away!"
3,Versatile but requires the right lighting,"My company need a digital camera for maintain progress photos of our projects. After looking at cameras from other vendors and trying cameras that our other departments were using our group decided upon the Mavica mainly because of the floppy drive. Overall, we have been delighted with the camera except for the fact that it is limited to daytime usage. In dim light conditions one has to be almost on top of the subject or the result is too dark. In addition, we found that the LCD screen was easily scratched by shirt buttons when the camera was carried on the strap around the neck. Also in the year of ownership we have had a floppy drive failure. Be aware that free labor charges end after 90 days and the normal charge is $ for repair. The parts are free within the first year of ownership. In conclusion, for daylight outdoor scenes or indoor scenes with the right lighting conditions this is a good camera. And for multiple users the floppy drive is efficient."
5,Two Awesome Little Stories about our Favorite Little Monster,"Our 2 year old son LOVE LOVE LOVES Elmo. He is also adicted to his Paci.. or binky or what ever he wants to call it that day.. usualy ""bah"". This episode of Elmo is helping him try to break himself of the ""binky"". We always remind him that ELMO doesnt use a binky anymore.. and he is a ""big boy"". He still loves the show and asks for it frequently though he has made it clear he is Not ready to say ""bye Bye Binky"""
4,Very pretty bracelet for the money,I bought 3 of these bracelets to wear at the same time as I like a bolder look. The bracelet is light-weight and the stones are quite pale but you can definitely see the blue and the stones sparkle beautifully. Pretty good for the money!
3,"More Mellower, Please","Hackett is a wonderful trumpet player, but the Soft Lights section is not the dreamy mellow music I wanted. On Soft Lights, he sounds more like a cross between a dixieland jazz player and a mood music player. His trumpet has a brighter sound than I would like, and I would prefer less use of trumpet mutes. The Mellow Mood section is more to my liking, but not as dreamy as the music he played on the Jackie Gleason recordings, which I prefer. Nonetheless, he is a great player, and if you like to hear a trumpet master, you'll enjoy his performances."
5,SO GOOD TO HEAR THIS MUSIC AGAIN,"I was a only boy of 11 when first hearing my uncle play ""In a Mellow Mood"". I just fell in love with the sound of Bobby Hackett. I continued to try and find the LP for over 20 years but Capital had stopped it's release. What a joy to discover it again. Thanks Capital/EMI. I bought my uncle a copy as well and he is soooo pleased with the memories it involkes. ""All Through The Night"" is my favorite. This is a Cole Porter tune not heard too often ...especially these days. Enjoy!!I wonder if there's any chance of getting another of Bobby's albums released. It's called ""Dream Awhile"" on columbia It's Bobby at his best with pipe organ. A Great Album!!!"
3,"MVC-FD88 Review from Arlington, Virginia","It's a good camera. We're pleased with most features of the camera except for the fact that every picture taken with the flash shows a serious red-eye problem. It doesn't matter from which angle the picture is taken from, the eyes appear very red (worse than any camera I've seen). We also used the FD-91 and it did not appear to have this problem."
3,sony does it better,have had this camera since 1999 still works really well quality captures and for those people with the older pc's (lots out there)which cant do usb without loading usb drivers or no usb ports! but have floppy drive
4,The glue is a little too strong,The adhesive is a little too strong and sometimes it leaves a red mark around the eye but it goes away. I have been told to tape the patch against the (clean) palm of my hand and remove it and do it a couple of times to remove some of the adhesive. Other than this my only problem is the shipping cost. If I order multiple boxes I am charged a shipping fee for each even though they all come in the same USPS package.
5,Wow!,"Okay, so this isn't as clean cutting and as prestigious as my Forrest WWII, but it's strength begins where there Forrest's start to fade. As a dedicated ripping blade for saws with average power, this blade is impressive. The flat tooth grind (FTG) leaves a nice flat bottom and is very efficient at removing chips so the blade can really walk through thick hardwoods. I had a $50 full kerf Freud LM72 that was a very good blade, but on my saw, the full kerf bogged down more than I wanted. The DW7124TK just walks through the heavy stuff....I'll refrain from the adage ""like a hot knife through butter"", but it really just keeps on plowing through 2""-3"" elm, maple, walnut, chestnut, etc. I couldn't be more pleased with the performance and price for a ripping blade."
1,???,Who would really buy this when they play re-runs all the time and can watch it free on Netflix or Hulu.
5,Janet Evanovich of the South,"If you can only read one mystery novel this year, this is the one you should pick! It is clever, witty, well-crafted and a great ride. Before you know it, you will be getting out a map to find your way to Dacus to visit your new friends. You go Avery Andrews. We need at least 7 or 8 more of these books and QUICK!"
5,Mary and Max,"Very nicely done. A film about some seriously difficult subjects, that makes you laugh. We will see it many times."
3,Left me depressed all day after seeing it,"The writing, production values and uniqueness of this film were above average but due to the depressing nature of the storyline and grim lives of the two characters, I would not recommend this film to anyone. This is one of the saddest films I've ever seen and I cried while watching it and was depressed all day after seeing it."
5,Delightful!!,"This is a profoundly sweet and moving movie. For claymation characters to move me to tears and laughter..says a lot about the delivery and message of the film. It is adult content, for the most part, however, definitely not one to be missed. Simply delightful !"
5,Excellent Service,"This was exactly what I was looking for, at a good price, and it arrived promptly."
4,:D,It's was a little slow movie but it helps me to understand a lot about some dissabilities that I was leading with in my classroom
2,"Dark, dank and disturbing","I read these great reviews, but I couldn't get into the plot and watching it with a 17 and 15 year old was embarrassing. I am not a fan and my son (17) turned it off right as the 8 year old girl is describing sex to a 44 year old man."
3,Movie was depressing off the wall odd humor...on the dark side.,Odd off the wall sorta people who like dark humor.That is who I would recommend this movie to...so you know who you are.
5,incredible animation,This is a sad story of human nature that brought out laughs and tears. Beautifully captures quirky moments with incredible animation.
5,Mary and Max movie,"Mary and Max is a very compelling story about pen pals from two different worlds. They become friends and become the most important people in each other's lives. The story is very sweet, funny and sad."
4,"Great tips, but a lttle depressing.","The book had some great tips on forgiveness that anyone can apply to their lives and activities you can do to clear your mind and figure out why you feel the way you do. But in the beginning are depressing stories about people's tragedies, which made me think about my own grief, and made me want to put down the book. But once you get past the pity parties, it gets a lot better."
5,Profound ... life understanding.,"This book spoke to me. The author seemed to understand and have lived through so many similar life events. Then I bought copies for my friends. Even with their life experiences different then my own, the books message positively helped their self understanding also. I would recommend this book to anyone suffering from resentment."
3,"""Husbands"",having a laugh....","Not one of Cassavetes more enjoyable films,but worth while for his fans,with minimal plot,John and his pals Gazzara and Falks improvising a fair deal,just messing about without theirwives,including flying visit to London for a few drinks."
5,Is This Supposed To Be Entertainment?Please Advise!!!,"This is a very bleak and depressing movie about 3 guys who fly off to London after going to a funeral of one of their friends. Instead of being grateful that they are still alive they then spend a few days arguing over nothing, drinking and indulging in casual sex.This movie was made by the very overrated and pretentious filmaker John Cassevetes who didn't even have the sense to stop drinking after his doctors told him this indulgence would cause his death which it did. He also had a reputation for making so called ""Arthouse Films"" which means that they didn't make much money.I give this movie 5 stars because it should appeal to all of the married losers out there who are too scared to get a divorce and because I have always like Peter Falk."
5,Very Useful,"As an aspiring author, let's face it--its tough to make ends meet. If you've ever tried to submit your work to a major publishing company, you'll understand what I mean. Stringer and McPherson's book offers a down-to-earth, step-by-step approach to self-publishing--which Stringer has proven to be a more than viable alternative to big publishing houses. If you want some real direction in your literary career, pick up this title."
3,Informative,This book provided resourceful information on how to prepare a book for publishing which was very helpful however it was not what I thought it would be. I anticipated more of marketing and publicity strategies for self publishers.
3,Nice but dated...,I enjoyed the book for the most part but I think there could have been more meat with this one. I must say I do love her rags to riches and more riches story....
3,Pretty Good,"As the author of Hidden Credit Repair Secrets, I found this book to be very valuable. It provided great resources on how to promote and market your book. It went into detail on how to submit to magazines and other publications. Great resource."
3,"General info, but still worth adding to collection","I am not that big a fan of street lit (even though this isn't street lit, I still think of it as such because it is published by Triple Crown) so it was hard for me to pick this title up and read it without judging the content of the other books she has published. But after realizing she is successful in the publishing industry for a reason, I knew I needed to add this book to my library. It is not as detailed as I would have liked. She actually glosses over the details and gives a very general overview of the business. Still, its information that everyone who is interested in publishing should know. There are more detailed books out there about the (self) publishing industry but again, you can't deny there is something about Ms. Stringer."
2,Stringer should probably stick to publishing...,"... and leave the writing to the pros. I bought Gavin Sinclair's book and this one at the same time and Sinclair's book is head and shoulders above this one. Stringer's book reminded me of something that might have been appropriate for 6th graders, not serious authors looking for a manual on self-publishing. I've also read her novel ""Let that be the reason"" and let's just say publishing might be her calling..."
4,"Compact, Bright, and Great Price","I love this little projector cause it small enough to lock in a filing cabinet, but bright enough to be used in most any situation. Excellent value for a 2000 lumen projector, especially as it comes with a nice carrying case and all needed cables. The audio system is barely useable, however -- so don't think of this as a mobile cinema solution. And you have to fuss with the controls a bit to get the colors to look right (flesh tones in DVD movies, for example)."
1,Disappointed,"This smokeless ashtray not only didn't suck the smoke into the filter, but it blew it back out. There also is very little room for the cigarette butt to be put out. I spent more money on this one smokeless ashtray than I did on purchasing 2 from another seller of which I was very pleased. I would not recommend this product."
1,"Does not perform as stated and implied, and will smoke you out rather than leave you smokeless!","This item was an exciting idea, but it stopped there. After receiving 2 of these items, both were tried and very little, if any smoke made it to the filter, even when holding a cigarette within an 1/8 of an inch from the intake. Usage of this item even as only a simple ashtray is not possible as the holders are so small that any cigarette of normal size does not fit.The item is made of what is clearly the cheapest materials and it shows in the workmanship. The plastic housing, wiring, battery cap and filter are reminiscent of that cheap 1 or 2 dollar toy car with lights one finds and discount stores.The practical application of this ""smokeless"" ashtray will leave you smoked out, and frustrated, with only a waste of your time and money."
3,Smokeless Ashtray,I returned the smokeless ashtray without trying it because there was no space for the used cigarette butts.
1,MALA,"NO SE VE BIEN LA IMAGEN, EL LENGUAJE ES EN INGLES Y POR LO TANTO NO ES LO MISMO QUE EN ITALIANO, PARECE UNA COPIA DE FORMATO VHS A DVD NO LA RECOMIENDO.DIOS LOS SIGA BENDICIENDO MUCHO!!!!!!!!"
1,Seems that they have 2 mango varieties,"A few months ago a friend turned me on to a bag of the Mariani Phillipine Mango & I had been hooked! I was excited when I saw that Amazon sold it in bulk, when the order arrived & I opened a bag, I was so disappointed. The variety Amazon carries is the ""Mariani Thailand Mango"" and the one I went crazy for was the ""Mariani Phillipine Mango"" there was a HUGE difference in taste & texture. Now I'll have to see who wants the 11 unopened bags I have :( At least I can buy the ones I like at my local Jewel Food Store."
1,Disappointing,I have learned the hard way that there are two TOTALLY different kinds of dried mangoes from this company. The first batch I bought were delicious and the second was awful.
4,"I love Mango, and I love these!","I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't order a bulk of 12 packages unless I knew what I was buying first. These are really good. I crave sweets and these help so I don't go for the higher calorie ones. I will say though that there is another brand (can't remember the name) that I DO like a little better. I can only find it in the grocery store though, not sold here."
3,Tumor x 14 plus 250 BPM,Remember those old songs that you listened to so much that they would give you a brain tumor if you listened to them again?Well think of this as 14 tumors sped up to 250 BPM rattling in you skull.The cd is almost a shame to other Dancemania Speed albums. Highlights from the tracks include:SmileLaylaand...That's about it. Most of the tracks are pretty unfaithful covers that are accomponied by pretty bad singers (almost makes you wish they had done remixes).Just sit it out and wait for Speed G3.
3,"Not the best episode, but I like it for personal reasons","Kinda weak installment of the MOH series. Model/actress Clare Grant is in it, and I knew her from college. So it is a treat for me to see her on film.With apologies to Clare (who was fine in this, by the way), this episode is only so-so."
2,Haven't I seen this before?,"In 'Valerie on the Stairs,' a young writer moves into an apartment complex populated by other aspiring authors. While working on his novel, the writer sees visions of a beautiful woman on the stairs. Who is she, and what do the other tenants know about her?I'd find this installment a lot more interesting if it didn't so closely mirror last season's ""Dreams in a Witch House"" episode, which also featured a student moving into a creepy house with strange disturbances and eccentric tenants. ""Witch House"" definitely had better execution, with a more compelling story and a tragic ending. By contrast, ""Valerie"" seems to offer a formulaic reveal of its plot twists, and the ending is neither tragic, scary, nor ironic, just...absurd. The moments of gore feel obligatory. And Christopher Lloyd, though welcomed, plays the same screwy character we've seen him do before.More of a disappointment that an outright failure. Stick with ""Dreams in a Witch House."""
2,Valerie in the Wastebasket,"This was my first (probably also my LAST) viewing of the ""Masters of Horror"" witches brew. This tepid--sometimes stunningly bad--installment is based on a short story by Clive Barker. I'm very familiar with Mr. Barker although I have not read his version of this.Let's see, the plot is something like this: down-on-his-luck writer gets a call from the manager of a for-writers-only apartment complex(?), checks in, but doesn't (CUE OMINOUS MUSIC PLEASE) check out. He starts seeing--naturally--Valeria on the stairs. I won't tell you anymore than this. You can waste one hour of your life just like I did. You get Christopher Lloyd, a/k/a the Reverend Jim from ""Taxi"", Tony Todd in the worst-possible monster makeup, and a little gore. Yawn. It took me THREE viewings before I could finish this; the first two put me to sleep like a little baby. Does that tell you anything?"
1,bleh,horrible movie. I heard good reviews so I bought it. wish I'd went with another of the movies from the series.
2,Yet another disappointment from Masters of Horror,"An unpublished writer (Tyron Leitso) moves into a boarding house for hopeful authors, where he becomes involved with a mysterious young woman (Clare Grant) and the demon (Tony Todd) that torments her. Clive Barker has done so much good work, but the tale upon which this short film is based must be one of his substandard efforts. Even at an hour, it feels too long. The twist ending is not particularly surprising, nor is it successful visually. In fact, it looks downright silly."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"*contains spoilers*like at least half the other episodes this one seems to have a script adequate to only fill 30 minutes of content so every scene is made twice as long as it needs to be to get the point across and often feels like watching paint dry. the only fault the director can be held accountable for is accepting the script. there were a few unanswered questions, mainly what the writers of the novel in progress knew about it's real life manifestation in the building. their agitation when questioned about it seemed to imply the two male writers knew about it, but how they felt about it is never addressed even though it seems like the single most relevant piece of information for understanding those characters behaviour. considering 50% of the time i spent watching it was utterly mind numbing i can't give it more than 2 stars. edit it down to 30 minutes and i'll give it 3."
2,Great --if you need a narrow shoe,"I ordered this in a wide size, and what arrived was a shoe that was extremely narrow, especially in the forefoot. A medium would probably correspond to extra-narrow or SS.It's not a bad looking shoe. The fabric finish makes it look like a dance shoe, which might make it a little artsy-looking for some workplaces."
3,A Dragon to Consider,"If you are a dragon lover and can deal with cute, this is one to pick up. However, if you can get a first hand look over of the dragon first before getting it, I'd recommend doing so. The necks of these dragons (as well as many of the other longer necked Beanies) can be weak and tip over to the side easily if there is not enough stuffing. The wings of this particular dragon are an iridescent cotton candy pink that is darker than what it looks like in the current Amazon picture as of 2/16/10. (The shine in the current picture makes the wings look lighter than what they are.)For the Beanie collector, Beanie's that are white or mostly white are ones to keep an eye on because they are more likely to become dirty and lose value (thus making them harder to get a hold of later pending how many were made at first production)."
4,Ty Beanie Babies - Magic the White Dragon,Impulse purchase because of Scorch the Dragon. I got the Scorch dragons for my four month old and saw this one and got it as well since I had an order already.
4,a great gift,this was a very good gift for my little sister. she has begun collecting plush dragons and she loved it!
2,"poorly edited, errors","I had high hopes for this book, since the Carpenters are good folks and I've listened to them on Ultraflight Radio. But this book is poorly edited. It reads like a collection of one-off writings thrown together. Sometimes it is specific with advice, but mostly it rambles on in obvious generalities. Sometimes it is very technical, using advanced terminology without explanation. Other times it's absolute beginner stuff.What's worse is there's a distracting spelling or grammar error on just about every page. And even errors like saying that air pressure decreases during descent."
3,Good and Bad,"Part of the problem with these was my interpretation of the word mint. I thought they would taste minty. They do not. They taste like chi (overwhelmingly like chi) and nothing else. If you like chi these would be good. If you don't care for chi and think it will be cover by ""mint"" flavor or any other flavor you probably won't like these. They were party favors so some people liked them some people didn't. I didn't and I had a few tins left over so I took them to work where again some people liked them some didn't. Mostly people who told me they liked them told me they were good chi mints; people who didn't like them said ""ew what kind of mints are these"" - obviously not chi fans. Everyone was a fan of the name of the mints though."
3,Gleason meets Dr. Zhivago,"If you're looking for the classic Gleason sound a la For Lovers Only, you won't find it here. I gave it three stars because while it is not what I expected, it was, never the less, good listening. Bobby Hacket's String of Pearls, Soft Lights or In a Mellow Mood are more like the old Gleason Sound....get them instead. This one has the Balalaika flavor of Dr. Zhivago. But,""good listening"" music is hard to come by. Enjoy!Lormat"
3,melted ice cream,"zombie music--for the sluggardly sort.never has an album cover less described the sound it enclosed. which must be a kind of frisson in itself.the third man theme at half speed? whatever.i spent years tracking down the vinyl of this, in the days before internet. it was much harder to find than any other gleason record, though i picked up several others for the whizzy cover art too.i still play his xmas record--in august.some distant, dark, ice-bound planet where the auroras slowly dissolve & reform.gotta love it."
2,"It's alright, but...","This is not a bad guide at all, but first of all, it's a universal guide, covering all three consoles. This is fine, except that I prefer a guide tailored to my own system, so that instead of the guide saying, ""press Action to...whatever,"" it says, ""press X or Circle...""Also, the guide assumes you'll play the game at the second difficulty level and doesn't account for the fact that some people, me included, play at the easy level at first. The guide is then very confusing, because it tells you to do stuff that the game doesn't want you to. There really should have been two sections, detailing the Easy and the Hard walkthroughs separately.Though it can be tricky, the game itself is awesome. The guide on the other hand could have been better."
2,This book comes from an LDS slant,"Before I picked up this book, I did not realize that it was written from an LDS (Mormon) perspective. I felt that it had marginal value for those in an evangelical setting."
5,GRIPPING,"One of the investigators in this True Crime story notes that "". . . this case had a variety of characters that the most fertile mind in Hollywood would have a hard time imagining . . ."" and author Steve Jackson manages to make me feel that I know them. Some I like, some I detest . . . and I do want to know how Joanne Cordova is doing with her life now. Joanne is a former Denver policewoman who fell into a life of drug addiction and prostitution and was involved in the story from the underside, yet found the courage to come forward and testify against killer Robert Riggan. The book is well written and the author has a real facility for holding on to all the different lines of the story and keeping them straight and moving toward the resolution. I'm sure that many crimes must have as fascinating a story underneath the headlines if only that story could be told. My hat is off to the heros of the story and to Steve Jackson for introducing me to them."
4,"Solid, Hard working laptop","I have had this computer for three years. It is my only computer, so between myself and three kids it stays pretty busy. I have had to replace the keyboard, it's pretty easy to knock the keys off if you aren't being careful. I also up graded the memory and replaced the dvd drive. It still runs perfectly, despite having two separate viruses removed from it over the past year. It is heavy, I would NOT recommend this computer if you have to carry your laptop around with you. The large screen and full sized number keyboard are really worth the extra weight and bulk to me though, so I just muscle through it. In all, I would absolutely buy this computer again. Thanks for reading my review :-)"
1,do not buy this laptop,"I purchased this model two years ago and immediately was dissapointed. this machine does not run vista well at all. I've since reformatted and installed xp (a difficult process since dell does not support xp drivers for this machine, but if you're savvy you can find through forums) with xp it runs better but Still would not recommend. there are other laptops out there that perform much better. The 1721 model is basically a big LEMON!"
3,A Good source book,"This book as the name indicates is the translation of Kitab-al Mustarshid. Al-Qasim in his book touches few fundamental concepts mostly about non-muhkem ayats such as visibility of God, location of God, hearing of God etc. Al-Qasim in principal tries to clarify these concepts using the Arabic usage of the words and also refering to Qur'an itself. Mostly he follows Mutazilite way of interpretation. He also refers to earlier interpreters such as Mujahid. This book is definitely a must read for persons who wants to read concepts and interpretations direct from the source. Book has Arabic original and English translation"
5,Easy to install,"My husband installed this control panel in no time. We didn't have the motion control on our last opener and we are really glad we have it now. As soon as we go in the garage the light comes on & it will turn off automatically. Sounds lazy, but it's a feature you don't think about and are glad you have it once you do."
2,Motion sensor had the light always on,"I installed this, and the Lock button and light switch and garage door opener worked fine. However, when I put it into automatic mode, where the motion detector should turn on when there's motion (or body heat in reality), then the light was always going on. After 5 minutes it would go off, and then within a few seconds go back on. My garage temperature is pretty normal (about 60F). I've returned it and am getting a replacement. Hoping it works."
3,Does what it says it does,Easy replacement for existing button. useful in a garage that can be entered through a door other than the garage door.A little pricy for a simple device.
3,Garage door opener control,The one I had broke so I sent them money and they sent me a replacement. Uneventful retail transaction unworthy of review.
4,This Toy ROCKS!!!!!,"This toy is awesome, its great! It is the perfect size for little hands. Awesome quality, it is hard to break, so it is ideal for anybody. It is very easy to hand wash."
1,"No Title, No Product","I am very disappointed because I never received my product, the beanie baby Pinchers. I ordered and PAID for it on December 10 and yet to receive it. It was supposed to be a Christmas Present for my son. I really thought I could trust the person selling it, because I thought it was backed by Amazon, but when I complained to Amazon, all they did was send me this link to give a review. Gosh, I feel so much better now. :("
1,Be VERY Careful!!!,"I purchased this bed for my italian greyhounds for their sleeping crate. They don't chew their beds so I thought this would be safe. We woke up to our boy screaming and found him tangled in the cord getting shocked. He had somehow gotten under the cord and when it trapped him he chewed it. He could have easily been electrocuted. This bed does not have a quick disconnect plug so he was plugged right into the outlet. It is obviously styled for use in a crate, but it is NOT suitable for that use. Buy another brand if you need a heated bed or you may end up losing your dog."
2,Picture misleading,This item is flat. There is no cushining/padding between your pet and the hard heating unit within. I would not trust this company again.
4,Great but fabric not as pictured,This bed was fluffier more cushioning than I expected for a heated bed. Cover was a very smooth canvas. Soft but not fuzzy or fleecy like pic. It was one solid color too. Still the adult cats love it! Pad works as described -- is barely warm until cat lays on it. Makes me feel pretty comfortable plugging it in and leaving it all day! I wish the cord came wrapped it bite proof metal but my new kitten hasn't shown any inclination to chew on it. I suspect I'm gonna have to get a second one so the adults don't have to compete. Someone is almost always on it!!!As another reviewer quipped on a different bed the cats would give it 5 stars!
3,lifesavers,"THE BEST THING ABOUT THE LIFESAVERS GUMMIES SOURS IS THE FLAVOR AND TARTNESS, BUT THEY WERE NOT FRESH. THEY WERE HARD TO CHEW. THEY MUST BE USING UP OLD PRODUCT. THE STORES IN SPOKANE HAVE ELEMINATED THE SOURS.THAT IS WHY I ORDERED THEM AT AMAZON."
3,"Looks nice, but not of very high quality","This is a nice necklace that goes with many of my tops. However, the quality is not good. I noticed several silver leaves on the necklace had already turned dark after a few wears."
5,"""The Grace""","When I first heard of this song on a website, it sounded so GREAT. I have not listened to the other songs on the cd but i'm sure they will sound good. This cd rocks and I can't wait to buy Act 2."
3,Meh,"I don't usually write these things, but I've read some of the comments and I really disagree with those people who've given this album high marks. The guys/gals saying ""every track is unique"" or some version of that are seriously full of it in my opinion - I've listened to it twice over and I remember only two tracks: #12 (The Grace - really great song and the reason I bought this CD) and #14 (Liar - with the singer from Our Lady Peace). The rest are completely unremarkable. If you're like me and heard ""The Grace"" and figure that the album'll have some other interesting tracks like it, I think you'll be really disappointed (I'm not, but only because I got it used for $10)."
5,Best Album Ever!,"Do yourself a favor and listen to the greatest album ever made in the history of the world! Even better than the soundtrack to ""Saved By The Bell - Hawaiian Style""!"
4,"Excellent, but needs adjustment","Perfect fit, but you need some small washers to adjust the petruding distance so your new stereo doesnt stick out more on one side. I have a 04 Civic Si. The color of this kit does NOT match, it is slightly darker.. more of a charcoal color compare to the silver color that its suppose to be. No big deal though. Btw, get a wiring harness so new stereo install is much easier."
3,Dog only likes some of the flavors...,"While I like the fact the biscuits are made of human-quality ingredients, my dog only likes some of the flavors. So next time I wouldn't buy a variety pack."
5,"Tawny/Music, Martinis and Memories","This is a wonderful place to order Music from, I love the way it is presented and Jackie Gleason is one of the best. His music is so smooth and so romantic. I own several of his CD's and they are all simply wonderful."
5,Jackie Gleason at his finest.,"The CD package was well packed and shipped promptly. If you like easy listening of the 'classics' of the forties, fifties and sixties, you will enjoy these."
3,Tawney Is NOt The Best,Too many of these songs do not match the usual smoothness found in his other alblums.
3,Atlas of Sleep Medicine,"Although the Atlas of Sleep Medicine is 10 years old, it contains still relevant, quickly referenced information presented in a clear, concise manner. I have owned a copy for 6-7 years and find that it answers some questions faster and better than more recent texts.At the time of issue it rated 4 stars. Due to its age and scope it now rates 3 stars.A vital comapanion to the Atlas of Sleep Medicine is the Atlas of Clinical Polysomnography (5 stars but much more expensive) by Nick Butkov."
4,Worth sticking with,Most of the action in this book takes place over the last few chapters. Sena spends a very long time explaining quite a bit of biology so at times it reads almost like a textbook or maybe lecture notes. Stick with it though because it gets very interesting once the plot starts moving.
4,"suspenseful, exciting and intellectual read.","I was have expecting this to by like the video game of the same name. That was only a minor inconvenience.I found this book a real page turner. It does get a little hard to follow at times. I suspect it has something to do with the unique Japanese names and culture. Despite that one tiny gripe, I was quite happy with the read."
3,Story not so good,"The writing method is good. The story has a lot of hospital related words. For me, the story is not so good. It's a little terrifying, but I think the story lacks on that emotion that makes the reader hooked in it."
5,Bien.,"I preordered this book a number of weeks ago and finally received it and I wasn't disappointed. I know nothing about the video game and to be honest am not particularly interested in the video game, but the novel's wonderfully inventive and incredibly entertaining.What the hell is up the the first reviewer, ""K. Jasmin ""Catjazz"",??! What an irritating, useless review. It's riddled with gramatical errors and I have no idea what the hell it's talking about."
4,"Very nice product, works and performs as described","I bought this so I could add the voice command with the sensor that detects a person outside the car. This product has worked 100% as described so far. The speaker is load and clear and it has a volume control so you can test it quietly. But, the directions stink! and the company don't offer much in support. I don't get what the issue is with providing a couple more pages of directions, maybe have a few people install them and see what kind of questions they ask? Well I did get it installed and its working to my satisfaction. It has a ton of verifiables so it should meet anybody's needs. Overall I got what I paid for and it does the job well. I wish the seller would build a website and provide a answer and question area or just go into more details on some of the install / program details."
4,Locks need improving,"I actually have two of these cases. They are a bit on the small side, so only a 10-12 inch bag will fit, but that was perfect for us. Be sure to empty out the side pockets of the golf bag as much as possible, since they need to be pushed in for the lid to close. The locks are pretty cheap, and the key doesn't always want to work. The plus side of the locks, though, the manufacturing company replaces them for free in the event of airline mishandling or abuse; plus they also guarantee your club safety up to $1500. Delivery was very quick, and we got both of the cases just in time for our trip. The true test will be the first flight..."
2,"Agree, too small","Agree with prior reviewer. This case is way too small to hold even a standard tilt-stand golf bag (non-cart type). Overall length of the case is good, fits right into my Xb.All my clubs including my standard driver fit, but unable to close the lid because the handle on my Tilt-stand bag is too rigid. Probably a soft pencil style golf bag will work. Will report back my results later....5/7/2008 update: purchased a Nike Skinny range bag, similar to ""Sunday Bags"" sold at amazon. With this bag, it fits the ATA case nicely. Keep in mind that this Nike bag doesn't carry a full 14 set of clubs comfortably (more likely 10-12 clubs), but i usually only play with about 7 or 8 clubs anyway. Just pack the ones you need and enjoy your round ""internationally""."
4,"Fast paced, fascinating, sexy, clever adventure","If you like faced paced, thrill a minute adventure, clever plot turns, a hero who can make you smile while you root for his success, exotic locales where the sking is great and the locals are colorful, a little passion, and a little esoteric information on the art world, you'll enjoy Clarke Wallace's, The Hercules Truest. I've never met Clarke, but he is either a great researcher or a very knowledgable skier who is familiar with the best and fastest runs around the world. He spends a lttle more time than I would have wished for tying everything together at the endé#"
3,"Cute, but small",I somehow thought this would be a much larger book. It's quite small in size. Still it's lots of fun to see all the variety of handbags over time. It's a light hearted subject.
4,Nice Pocket Size Reference Book,"This is a great small reference book for the person who loves handbags for collecting or for resale. The pictures are great and the descriptions are a bit too short, but ok. I keep this book in my bag or car and have found it very useful! Well worth the money."
5,Purse Princess.,I am a known shoe queen and purse princess. I bought this book for a fellow princess and thumbed through it before I wrapped it up. It's a nice little book for any handbag lover.
4,You May Never Look At A Handbag The Same Way Again..,"This little book is loaded with beautiful pics of purses of all kinds. From the functional to the whimiscal(and there are some really off-the-wall ones included),you'll find it in here besides plenty of interesting facts about different bags and designers as well. I wish it had more ""timelines"", but, other than that,if you really appreciate the art of handbags(or know someone that does),this tome should be very appreciated.."
4,Lovely Eye Candy,"Handbags is a light-weight (as in no information on what makes a great handbag great) lots of very good photographs of iconic ""classic"" and ""it"" bags. Lovely biographical sketches of taste-making handbag designers and many historical bags and historical details (but not adequate if you are doing historical costumes). One brief sketch of how a very high-quality (Hermes) bag is constructed. All in all a lovely read, though, because of the pictures."
5,"Expanded version of ""Legend""?","Quick note: this 34 track, 2-disk set contains 13 of 14 tracks on the 1984 release of ""Legend"" - ""Three Little Birds"" is not included, which is a curious song to leave off. Anyway, I think it's a great expansion. Also, in response to an earlier review, I did a side-by-side listen of a couple of tracks with the 1984 Legend CD and the bass is every bit as strong ..."
2,book unreadable,"The info about the book says there may be occasional imperfections, but the copy we received was almost entirely unreadable. Ii wish they had been more clear about the quality of the facsimile."
3,King Bio,"My back and muscle problems were cause by surgery, so the homeopathic remedy helps somewhat, but it doesn't get rid of the problem completely."
2,Pirsson; Rocks and Rock Minerals,"Rocks and Rock Minerals: A Manual of the Elements of Petrology Without the Use of the Microscope. This is a reprint of the 1913 version of this classic text. Not a 2009 edition. Its a classic, but very dated. Almost 75% is devoted to igneous rocks and the remander to sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. It will be of interest to some, but outdated for use in the class room."
4,Great Compozition.,I could not find this CD except Amazon. Thank a lot. You feel relax while you are listening this. You feel as if you are in spain at last century.
5,The all-time best Bobby Hackett album?,"This double CD consists of two very similar albums released by Capitol in 1955 and 1957. The first was Coast Concert, with Bobby Hackett playing a cornet. The latter album featured Hackett on trumpet, a fact well-documented by photographs taken during the session. Joining him on some of the first album and all of the second was trombonist Jack Teagarden. If there was ever a better match of tone, technique and lyricism, I haven't heard it. Many Hackett fanatics consider Jazz Ultimate to be the very best single album Bobby ever made, and it's hard to argue with. Most would describe it as ""Dixieland"" but Bobby preferred to call it ""Chicago Style."" Call it what you will, but this is tasty music played in a timeless, no-gimmicks style. These albums represent the first CD re-releases of Hackett's Capital jazz library (excepting some high-priced collector's editions), and you should buy this double CD while you can."
5,Jazz Ultimate/Coast Concert,These cocerts are just great in every aspect. Bobby Hackett and Jack Teagarden were the best in my opinion.
4,Hackett & Big T at their best; cheesy packaging,"Here are two fine, swinging albums combining the talents of Bobby Hackett and Jack Teagarden, beautifully recorded by Capitol in the late '50s. ""Jazz Ultimate"" is taken from the stereo master although you will not see this noted on the CD; ""Coast Concert"" was recorded in mono only. Music this good is deserving of fine liner notes but Collectors Choice did not bother to commission same; the original back covers are reproduced, with print so tiny that a magnifying glass is literally required to read them! And the songs are listed out of sequence on the tray card and liner. Sloppy, cheesy and typically Collectors Choice (once the standard for reissues, now an also-ran). I still couldn't bring myself to dock the rating by a star as I normally would - Hackett and Big T were never better, and ""Jazz Ultimate"" is one of the top traditional jazz albums ever cut. Remastering is fine."
1,Junk!,"The canopy broke after the 3rd use. When I returned it, I was told that these have a lot of problems. So I bought a Quik-Shade instead. Don't be fooled by the higher price - it won't last!"
1,Bad Gazebo,"I purchased this unit, with the hopes that it would be a good one. It set up easy, but during a shower, it started to collect water in all corners (8 spots, 2 on each side). It leakes water, so DON""T plan on using it even in the lightest rain. Customer service is no HELP, there are other units that perform better. DO NOT BUYFROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Worth every penny,I shopped around for a few weeks before I purchased this canopy. The price was right and I love that it comes with all four sides as well as the awning. I recently brought it to a vendor event and the two women who helped me put it up were in awe of how easy it was compared to their tents. I left it up overnight with all four sides on and it stayed quite warm the next day even though it was damp and raining. Several other vendors were admiring my setup and I told them exactly where to go. This was a great investment for me!
1,A used product came!,"I purchased a new tent, but what came has apparently been used! It is dirty and the zipper is broken on the bag. There was also a broken piece of plastic - that I haven't figured out where it came from yet.If I knew how to send it back, I would. There is no return information available.I've been had :("
4,"Not merely ""also rans""","While there's no shortage of books chronicling the contributions that the motorcycle industries of Britain, Italy, Germany and Japan made to Grand Prix racing, the smaller European nations seem to have been overlooked.With this book, Mick Walker goes a long way to righting that wrong and reminds us that without the likes of Jawa and Bultaco, the racing landscape of the 50s and 60s would have been much poorer. Mick combines just the right amount of technical information with interesting biographical information on those who designed them and those who rode them. The photographs are excellent and the layout is easy on the eye. If you felt your racing library was incomplete, this could be the one that fills an important void."
5,cute!,"Perfect for my ADD engineer friend who is always getting distracted. (think of the movie Up - where the dog ""Doug"" was always losing focus whenever he saw a squirrel)"
1,The World's worst psychotherapist,"Here we have a family therapist who acts totally contrary to all the advice she dishes out in her office. And we are supposed to identify with this dysfunctional woman? While she is ignoring her advice at home she is about to have an affair with a man when his wife coincidentally comes to her office for advice. Our hero therapist can't wait to run to this lady's husband and tell him everything that his wife said. What is amazing is that it never even crosses her mind that to pass on this information would be highly unethical - as having an affair with the husband of a client would also be. The main puzzle in this book is trying to determine who is the most addled, the main character or her serial killer loving sister."
3,Not Jane Fielding's best work.,"This was the first Jane Fielding book I read and I'm glad I didn't let it deter me - but it would some. I knew her reviews were good, so I gave her another chance. I urge others to do the same.This book was predictable. It also focused much more, or at least too much, on details about West Palm Beach. All that wasn't necessary - for that I could've picked up a free travel book from AAA!"
1,MINDLESS DRIVEL,"The book drones on with a lack of direction. The sister in the book is a mindless twit that decides to date an accused serial killer after seeing his picture in the paper???? I gave up after page 100, it's just not worth my time. Where was the editor on this book?? He/She should have asked for a rewrite long before it hit the streets!!!"
3,"Don't overanalyze, just enjoy!","I enjoyed this novel, and especially the fact that it was written in the first person. It's got a fast-paced plot and lots of psychological suspense.I found the characters a bit frustrating, but that actually worked for the book. The characters, especially Kate, do some stupid and annoying things, but we eventually learn about the charcters' history, and understand why they do the dumb things they do. It adds an element of human nature and behaviour to a somewhat basic mystery plot. That's not to say that the mystery fell flat; there were some twists and surprises which made for an overall good read. The trick to enjoying this book is to not overanalyze - just enjoy."
2,"Stupid main character, but others realistic and believeable","I completely agree with the long review preceding this one. Kate Sinclair's character was too stupid for words. However, I do want to be fair and point out that other characters in the book are very well-drawn. My grandmother had Alzheimer's and was EXACTLY like Kate's mother. I know a teenager just like Sara. Jo Lynn's adult behavior is typical of a victim of childhood incest.Why on earth the main character was made to be such a fool is beyond me. Don't publishing houses have editors who point out problems with plot and characters and so forth? This editor must have been out to lunch."
3,"i thought it never got anywhere, not enough suspense","the book started out very slow, i really waited for a huge out come at the end of the book and it lacked everything, i love joy fieldings books, but this one really didn't have me at the end of my seat like her other books do. sorry..."
1,Not one of Fielding's best works,"Normally, I look forward to anything Joy Fielding writes and expect that once I start one of her books I don't put it down until it's done. This book was weak, completely unbelievable and definitely a disappointment compared to her other tomes and proves that you can't buy a novel simply because of the author's name. The protagonist was a wimp and should have her license revoked. Maybe I listen to Dr. Laura Schlessinger too much, but I would hope that someone who is trained in human behavior would have a much less dysfunctional family than Kate Sinclair was stuck with (or enabled). I found myself muttering, ""Yeah, right"" or ""what an idiot"" frequently. I was relieved to finish the book and instantly relegated it to the garage sale pile (which is saying a lot considering that I NEVER throw books away). Please, Ms. Fielding, spend a little more time on your next work so that I can once more recommend you to my friends."
3,Mixed feelings about this lens,"This lens will work ok if you use it on tripod or if your camera is one of those which have on board image stabilization like Pentax cameras.With others, like Canon, you will be struggling to get pictures without being affected by shake in case you use low ISO. Another issue is that focusing is manual and even with split screen it is not easy. So the only solution is to have it on tripod and use live view.My lens had an issue where it was not able to focus at infinity. I took my angle grinder and chopped some metal from one of the sections, now it works fine. In the end I bought Sigma 18-200 which has autofocus and image stabilizer. So now I use this Opteka lens as autoguider for my telescope, but not for photography."
3,Not as durable as I had hoped.,"Just bought a replacement for the first one that was part of a kit. Used it for four seasons on a small boat (lots of pounding). It was also facing forward on a part of the boat that was not protected during trailering and was inside a stainless mounting. The constant exposure probably didn't help it, but at the end of four seasons, the display wasn't displaying, only backlighting worked. Took it out and there was some moisture ""intrusion"" that caused rusting around the display connections on the board. I'm installing a cover over the mounting bucket on the boat to protect it from direct sun and road blasting when not in use. Dual radio and speakers continue to give no problems."
5,Great SLR (yes even today)!,"Ah the X-9. This was my first film SLR and still holds a special place in my heart. This manual SLR had many advanced features - coupled with the Minolta MD mount meant that this camera was VERY capable, and favored by many!PROS- Many features of ""pro"" SLRs- Aperture priority mode- Durable body while remaining lightweight- Very pleasing shutter soundCONS- Prone to capacitor failureMaybe I'm biased, but this camera served me extremely well during the time that I had it. Some of my all time favorite pictures were taken with this camera, and because Minolta lenses can't be adapted well for current DSLR cameras Minolta gear is VERY cheaply had right now. The prices on this page are about $100 over - I would consider looking around some other sites. Overall this is an excellent beginner SLR with enough features to keep most pros happy. The sleek design makes it not too much more cumbersome than a good rangefinder, and I found it very easy to travel with. Highly recommended!"
2,A Journey,"Paris has great sultry authority and a natural rasp. Basically all the lady has to do is breathe and she's won you over. However, her singing on this romantic outing is plodding and (inappropriately) mannered.Even in the most anemic moods this album would be tedious. Her phrasing here is overbearing and replete with long-winded bellows, especially on the drawn-out codas. It's heavy man. Heavy like a burden.These are literate torch songs, but with her twisting, loop-de-loop phrasing she deflects attention away from the mood and lyrics, and draws attention to more trivial matters, namely her acrobatic larynx.There's ""making a song your own""...and there's downright annoying. With all her warbling the recording nearly sounds warped. As much as I love her voice, I couldn't wait for these epics-in-slow-motion to end. If the producer had reigned her in a bit...""cut the crap Rebecca"", this album could have been a giant. That's what you get for trying too hard, when all you had to do was sing."
2,ultimately boring,"Listening to one track tells the story for everything else to come. She sings everything the same way - sorry but ultimately, in the end - it's a bore...."
3,Great voice--too slow and sultry,"My first Rebecca Parris album, I bought it based on listening samples. She has a wonderful, breathy voice reminiscent of Morgana King or the lower registers of Cleo Laine. Her style is not unlike Morgana's. Her diction is excellent. However, Ms. Parris sings every song on this album in a very slow and sultry fashion, painfully slow in my opinion. Although I think her voice is excellent I will hesitate to purchase one of her earlier albums."
2,Didn't work for me,"I tried this guard for 4 nights before tossing it. I could not close my mouth with it in and overall found it very uncomfortable. My jaw would be extremely sore the next day after wearing it. I could only see this guard working for someone with a large mouth, regardless of it being adjustable. It's just too bulky. I ended up with the Dentek Comfort Fit Nightguard, which is very similar but much less bulky."
2,Doesnt really help with clenching,"The first couple days of using this product your jaw feels very painful getting used to it. By the 5th and 6th day I actually woke up with no pain first time in a long time. But I was clenching so hard when I put my night guard back in for the 7th day it fit differently and I used it for 1 month every night after that just to make sure it was a lost cause and the pain started getting worse. My bite was off in the morning from clenching so hard on the nightguard, and it ended up hurting more than before I got it which was horrible."
4,mrs flat- teeth,"I have had problems with my teeth grinding in my sleep at night.Ive tried several over the counter bite plates, but found them uncomfortable and ineffective. My dentist suggested Sleepright and I can feel the difference. It really has trained my brain to stop touching my upper and lower teeth; when I do my jaw gets shakey, prompting me to open.Thank you very much. I alerted my dentist already!"
4,only one i'll buy now,Have had tmj and been a night grinder for years. Insurance does not cover dental night guards and when i paid out of pocket i was not impressed with them. i used thosecrap boil ones for a long time till i found this one. the low profile works well for not making my mouth hurt and it is the most comfortable one i have ever had. i go through them quickere than i would like. i wish they held up just a bit better. but will sacrifice that for the wearability of them. i do not buy any but these now. flavored is fine too but doesn't last long so i just get whichever.
1,Not Happy with this!,The additional flap irritated my gums after just 3 nights so much that I could not wear it anymore. I had to get another made from my dentist and it is so much better. Parent company would not take back as I had exceeded the 30 days. I am not happy and out $30.
2,Not comformable,I found this mouth guard very unconformable. It's too big. I purchased the DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard kit and like it much better.
4,"Works great, helps me to get asleep without grinding my teeth","Works great, I bought this for my wife and it helps her to get asleep without grinding teeth and she has stopped waking up with a pain in her jaw the next morning."
4,Beats spending $600 for a dental appliance,"I actually returned my dental guard because using it helped me discover that I don't clench my teeth, like I thought I did. I used it for two nights and had no trouble with it staying put. I was able to continue sleeping with my mouth closed, and my husband did not report any snoring or other side effects. I have a very small mouth, and this fit comfortably. I would have been really angry if I had spent $600 on the dental appliance recommended by my dentist (based on the symptoms I described) only to discover that my habit is tensing all my facial muscles at night, not clenching my teeth."
2,mouthpiece,"It is not what I expected for rhe price, My moth isn't that big and i can't seem to adjust the piece to be comfortable for the night. Would I get another one ? No!"
4,Comfortable,I haven't enjoyed the fact that I have to wear a mouthguard but am glad I found one so comfortable. Initially it took a few days to get used to it but now I can sleep soundly with it
4,Good Value for the Price,"Item was a good value for the price. I know a professional mouth guard would have been more durable, but this one held up for almost a month. I'm sure the reason for that is that I grind my teeth unbelievably hard.I felt very lucky to find a mouth guard that fit. I have a very small mouth and have had to have eight teeth pulled to make all of them fit, so this was a good thing. The adjustable bit wings also allow a more customizable fit.All this to say - if you have a mild case of bruxism and/or a small mouth, this would be an excellent product for you to consider."
4,"awkward, but it works","got the slim comfort model and while it seems to be too big, it is comfortable, stays in place while I sleep, and I seem to breathe easier with no jaw pain. Don't think it will last indefinitely as it is squishy, but that's acceptable given the level of comfort provided."
4,Great Temporary Fix,This a great way to determine if a custome bite guard will work. Inexpensive and easy to follow instructions. Would recommend for night grinders.
1,Lasted about 5 weeks...,"Had a similar mouth guard before and was very happy with it. I found this one uncomfortable, and one of the bite wings snapped after about 5 weeks. The return policy seems impossible to use. The wording on it says something like if it's prescribed, can return if it wears through within 12 months. Mine was neither prescribe or really worn through. I would not recommend this product - expensive, uncomfortable, and it broke pretty quick."
1,Waste of Money,"Product too flexible which leaves you feeling like it will be swallowed at any moment. The adjustable notches are of no use as it feels the same no matter what you do. A proper fit and acceptable comfort level is impossible. Customer service gave me the royal run-around to return it, then claimed they never received it. If I had to order another guard I wouldjust go back to the models in which you boil to fit. I though this product would be better thanthose traditional units, but this SleepRight was just terrible and so was the company."
3,Bulky,I have a small mouth and have found this to be bulky and uncomfortable - even when adjusted to the smallest size. Would not buy again.
4,Helps stop grinding,"I purchased the SleepRight night guard -low profile about 2 weeks ago and have been using it faithfully. It has helped me to stop clenching and grinding my teeth therefore eliminating my headaches. The low profile is especially good for me. I have a nightguard from my dentist but it was not stopping me from grinding my teeth, I was grinding the night guard against my bottom teeth. So far I have been pleased with the SleepRight night guard and I recommend it to anyone who has this problem."
5,My teeth love it!!,"I have paid far more for a less superior product. If you're a ""serious"" teeth grinder this is the best for the money."
2,"""feels"" good, but falls out of my mouth every night","I like the fact that this nightguard is soft and pliable. I find that it is comfortable to wear, night or day, even compared to the extremely expensive ""custom"" ones that I get from the dentist. But soon I was finding it on my pillow every night. In fact, it didn't stay in very long at all. I got the low profile because my mouth is small. It doesn't need to be boiled, but it is adjustable by moving the vinyl platforms back or forward in the notches. I still think that, for $30, it is worth a try, since other people have had good luck with it. This is a infinitesimal fraction of what I have paid out to dentists in my life, and I still have Temporal Mandibular Joint Dysfunction!Good Luck!"
1,Made me gag. Couldn't wear overnight.,"I did not like this product because it was so floppy and unstructured and the one-size-fits-all bite pieces were so wide that it was hitting the back of my tongue and made me gag and even with the adjusted connector on the smallest setting was still sticking out of my mouth. It was awkward and I couldn't sleep with it in and even when I fell asleep with it in, I took it out in my sleep. It is durable and flexible and even adjustable, but I would not recommend it for small mouths."
1,dental guard,"I have tmj and must use night guards so I won't chip my front teeth. My other one is very bulky and big in front. I can hardly close my mouth so I tried this one. I initially likes it because there's nothing in front, until I woke up. Because it doesn't actually fit in place I found I had to kind of suction it in place. When I woke I had the side screw adjustment things painfully imprinted in my checks. I can not use this, way too painful."
2,Too bulky,"So I tried these after I was going through theseDenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard kitkinda quickly. Bad move. This one is just too bulky, so although I wasn't wearing through it as much, it was highly uncomfortable. Went back to the DenTek soon after."
2,"works, but breaks after a few weeks","I have gone through 4 of these since the first of the year.yes they work, but then they break in the middle. I don't know if it's me or what.I won't be ordering any more."
3,Decent product,I'm not as impressed with the product as I am from the one I have from the dental office. Not bad though for the price. It'll take time to get used to.
2,Didn't work well for me,"Doesn't work well. Only used it a couple of times because the old one I have, a boilable, works better. Mary Dohrman"
4,an affordable night guard option,I have bought this night guard several times before. (I tend to bite through it in about a year.) It is comfortable and affordable and it protects my teeth from my constant clenching and grinding.
1,Inexistent Customer Service,"The guard didn't fit well because it was huge, if you are over 7 feet never mind. The real reason why I am writing this review is different. Sleep Right is supposed to have a sort of warranty in which if the product doesn't work out, you can just email it back along with the receipt and get a refund. Great idea! they now have my guard, my receipt, and my money! Good luck in calling customer service, I don't know why they have that policy if they have no intent on following it. Had I known this I would have just cut the loss short and not bothered mailing them back that useless product."
4,Nice..,"I am sure this nightguard is much better than the ones you have to boil and bite in to. This one is very comfortable, and matches my jaw exactly (I have a small jaw). I thought that I would spit it out in my sleep, b/c it isn't like the one the dentist made for me, but I kept it in all night. Like every night guard, it takes some getting used to. It even comes with a nice case to keep it."
1,Avoid,We used the Dental Guard you boil to get a perfect fit. This contraption was supposed to be better then boiling. Riiight. Those lego-block sides scraped the sides of her mouth and she tossed it after 2 nights. Yes we adjusted it and did all we were supposed to do. Those flat sides and plastic walls just rubbed her the wrong way. Literally and figuratively.
2,"Certainly not ""comfort"" for me.","Unfortunately much as I tried to persevere, this did not work for me, giving me sleepless nights. The band that goes around the lower gums was far too long with no way of adjusting it. If I adjusted the other part so it sat further at the back of my mouth then the positioning wasn't correct as shown in the leaflet. I know I have a small mouth but I felt that there wasn't enough attention drawn to the fact that those that do have small mouths should have the other version. Because of the hygiene issue I felt it would not be fair to return it as it would no longer be saleable. I have given it two stars. one for the fact it probably does work fine for those with average or larger size mouths. Two, the silicone material did seem as if it would be comfortable should it have fitted. Because of the cost I feel I can't risk buying/wasting money for the smaller one."
1,BURN IT!! Do not use it! Use = CROOKED teeth..,"I used this mouth guard for less then two weeks. Today I looked in the mirror and almost cried. My teeth are crooked. My front two teeth are completely off to one side, like Tom Cruises front teeth. I looked at others reviews and I found others to say the same. DONT BUY THIS!!"
5,Great product!,I would reccommend this to anyone who grinds their teeth at night. This mouth piece lasts so much longer than anything else I've used and it keeps my jaw from hurting in the morning.
1,Disastrous,"I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews before purchasing this nightguard. Like others have reported, it moved my teeth--not only did it do nothing for my pain from clenching, but now I have an open bite (none of my teeth touch any more, except the four back molars which didn't make contact with the nightguard). Now I have to undergo extremely costly, painful, and lengthy orthodontic treatment to try to correct the damage. (The model the orthodontist made of my teeth shows a clear gap in the spaces where the two rubber planes fit when I wore the mouthguard.)I'd advise others to avoid this nightguard at all costs. I wish I had never used it."
2,Not Practical for Heavy Chewers,This guard slips around at night and my bf has chewed into the front part of it so it's breaking apart in the middle. I don't think he will be able to use it much longer because it might split in half soon.
1,Returning it- It moved my teeth in a week!,"I'm returning this dental guard. I had been using it at night for only about a week when I noticed my front top teeth were pointing inwards towards my mouth! I couldn't close my jaw properly. It was disturbing. Luckily a few nights of not using it seems to have let my mouth readjust to its usual self. Even aside from the terrifying insight that my teeth were wandering, I found the edges of the guard too high. They rubbed too much into my cheeks and were causing problems with the skin there."
2,Not very comfy,"So I bought it, because I clinch my jaw...It just was not comfy at all the front part pushed my bottom lip out so it was hard to close my lips. No matter how I adjusted it..just didn't work. The back part was fine though, it worked like it was suppose to.It might work better with someone with a bigger mouth."
2,Hurt my mouth,"The price was right to try this out, but the sides were too tall for my mouth. They left my gums feeling sore and bruised and I couldn't wear it the next night. I'm female, with what I'd guess is an average mouth size. My husband also tried one of these, but after a friend said that their dentist-made mouth guard has lasted many years, he decided to go that route. I wouldn't recommend this product, but if you want to try it, females (at least) should go for the low profile version."
1,Cracked off a piece of my tooth,"I just want to warn anyone about this product based on my own experiences. My teeth slipped off this product during the third night that I used it and I ended up cracking off a piece of my molar. Needless to say, I was not happy. There is nothing to keep the product in your mouth, and so, if you grind your teeth (which is I think the point of the mouth guard) it can slip off in your mouth. The company gave me a refund and ""officially"" claimed that they never heard of this happening before. Yet, one person at the company had previously slipped and told me that someone else had a claim similar to mine. Just based on the design of the product, it is easy to see how it might happen to many others."
2,Too big,this product is too big for my mouth and is very hard to sleep with it in my mouth i will not purchase again
1,Don't waste your Time or Money....,"This product does not work. You look like a football player with it in your mouth & it is very uncomfortable. Don't waste your time or money on it. I went to my dentist & had one custom made for me. It was $95 & well worth it, fits me perfect."
3,"Better then NTI for relief, lacking durability.","This gives my wife more relief then the dentist made NTI bite guard, but its durability could be much better."
2,Sleep Right - so-so,"At first, I was afraid that I might choke on the item, however, when put in place correctly it stayed secured. However, I did not feel that this system protected the back molars when ""clenching"" down. Not sure I would buy another one."
4,A great book.,The book itself was informative and inspiring. I got the electronic version and was a little disappointed that the footnotes were mixed into the text of the book. It made it harder to read.
4,Science Fiction Miracle Grow,"Written soon after World War II, this book encapsulates many of that decade's turmoil and at the same time manages to project into the future to address some interesting contemporary ideas into a compact and delightful science fiction satire. Ward Moore's style of writing is clever and comical without veering from the main character's oddball mindset and vernacular. The mutant grass is a metaphor for good against evil, mankind against nature or nature against mankind, World War III, and precedes the writings of the environmental historians and of environmental ethics in philosophy. The book also touches on such issues as environmental determinism, evolution, and survival of the fittest, and too, looks at various biblical themes, among them, Adam and Eve (Eve being Miss Francis) and Noah's Ark. When you read it you will probably find your own list of cleverly placed themes and analogies."
4,A dated classic...,"...well worth reading. Because it was written so long ago (1947!), some of the dialogue is stilted, and is written in the way that people spoke then. It's a bit plodding in places, but a novel concept, and well written."
1,A Book of Witchcraft Masquerading as a Catholic Book,"If you are a believing Orthodox Christian, Catholic or otherwise, this book is NOT for you. This book takes spells, incantations, and dresses them up as ""quaint"" folk stories hoping ignorant people will ensnare themselves in its blasphamy. It will bring you only curses for using it, as the Bible says in Gal 5:20-21 ""those who practice such things (sorcery,witchcraft) will not inherit the kingdom of God"""
4,Great R/C Blimp for the price,"I bought this for my 11 year old son. He has had a blast playing with it and picked up the controls quickly. This is a great deal compared to other R/C blimps I have looked at. One item needed for assembly, but not mentioned, is doubled sided tape, it makes the tail fins and propeller housing much easier to attach."
4,"Good moisurizer, Good tan results","For the price, this is a pretty good deal. I don't like to tan, but if I use this product 2 days in a row, I get a nice subtle ""glow"". I am rather fair skinned, and I was happy that I didn't look orange, or just look like I had a completely fake tan. But I don't use it as a daily moisturizer- although the moisturizing part does an adequate job, plus it says that it firms; Although I am not sure how well that works. Either way, for the price, it is a good moisturizer and works better as a tanner than DOVE tanning moisturizer, which is the only thing I can compare it to. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a slightly soft and tan kind of look."
1,"Verbose, unintelligable","I think the other reviewers are my classmates. I also found the book overly wordy, but meager with the derivations. The homework problems are often unclear. I found Kittel's text much clearer and straightforward and, surprisingly, more up-to-date."
2,Impenetrable,"The author makes no attempt to emphasize key points over tangents. The text is very verbose and encourages the reader's mind to wander. Additionally, the problems don't really follow the material discussed. Calculations are often mysterious."
3,Was not true to size,This coat is a lot bigger that tne size claims. I returned the product. If you can get it to fit..it has the potential to be a nice warm stylish coat.
4,ceiling fixture,The light looked exactly like the pictures and fit my decor perfectly. My only complaint and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the installation instructions were not so great. I'm just a regular homeowner not a handy man and really NEED directions! All in all this was a great purchase at a really good price.
4,Miele Galaxy Orion power cord issues,"I bought my Miele Orion around 6 years ago and loved it. However, a couple of years ago, the power cord burned out and the plug kept sizzling upon insertion into an electric socket. I found an authorized dealer nearby, and he said he had to replace the entire cord. He did so for around $80. Now, it has happened again and I wonder if this is a manufacturer defect since I do not want to keep paying $80 plus tax each time."
5,Time For a Reprint!,"It's too bad this book is out of print, because these are the adventures (many very funny but in the end very sad) of one the greatest (if not THE greatest) drummers of all time. And besides that, it's written by a guy who knew Moonie and witnessed his antics 1st hand. I wish the guy who's trying to make a screenplay the best of luck. The next step after consulting Butler is to get permission from the Who to use their songs. To close this review, I'd like to paraphrase the last sentence in the book, ""Keith Moon ups and [very] well dies."""
3,Full Moon; a Must read!!!,"Full Moon: The Amazing Rock and Roll Life of the Late Keith MoonDougal Butler has written the definitive book about Keith Moon. As a longtime roadie, personal assistant, and Who insider for many years, Dougal was the one who was by Keith's side throughout. From the hysterically funny to the heart wrenching moments, Dougal stood by Keith through it all. The book not only has been re-issued, but is now available as an audio book. If you're a rock fan, this is a book not to miss. Rated 5 stars!!!"
5,Spectacular. Peter Schreier is absolutely perfect,"This is currently my favorite performance of Das Lied Von Der Erde (I have about 9 recordings of it). Sanderling gives a wonderful reading here, with an amazingly sharp attention to every little detail of the performance. The orchestra plays absolutely flawlessly, and the sound engineering gives just the right mix between the singers and the orchestra.As a whole, I often find this performance less gripping than the Klemperer or the Horenstein performances. However, Peter Schreier as the tenor truly delivers what I believe to be the best performance on record that I have heard. From the very first line in ""Das Trinklied Vom Jammer Der Erde"" to the final drunken cry in ""Der Trunkene Im Fruhling"", Schreier is such a joy to listen to.Highly recommended!"
1,Horrible,"For my honeymoon, I purchased this camera for scuba diving photos (because of its flash) and 2 cheaper Kodak disposables without flash for beach and snorkeling pictures. The SharkDiver camera was horrible. The film advance was difficult to turn, the shutter was hard to push down, the flash didn't always function, and on and on. Then, worst of all, the casing apparently leaked and after going to all that trouble to take a full roll of pictures, we ended up with 4 discolored, double exposed pictures and none of the others came out at all. On the pictures we did get, the use of the flash didn't seem to matter at all -- they were still pretty dark.The Kodak cameras by comparison were great. They were easy to use and produced good pictures in spite of not having a flash. I used them on several pictures at ~20-25 feet under and had plenty of natural light for a good picture."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was looking for an inexpensive camera with a flash for SCUBA diving. Believe it or not a $9 camera from kodak that you can get at walmart but doesnot have a flash is BETTER than this one.First, instructions are horrible. they do not exist. The package doesn't tell you to turn in the whole camera (minus the plastic shell) to the developer. the inside camera is a ""disposable"" and you are required to buy another one. Ritz camera had the refills for 9.99.Second, the flash only worked part of the time and the shutter button sometime pressed easily and sometimes it didn't.My only roll of film I took was a complete waste.Sorry, spend some extra cash and get something better."
1,Don't Buy it.....Ruined our Tahiti Vacation,Film did not advance and there were vertical stripes on the one roll that did advance and take pics. Don't risk your vacation snorkeling or suba on this camera.
1,Overall design is horrible. Velco strap is too short and wears out very fast. Padding is in the wrong spot.,"I do 90lb single leg thigh ab/aduction and the velcro no longer has purchase after 4 days of use. Not only did the velcro give after 4 day (8 times taken off), the padding placement isn't even in the right place to offer coushion.I would say around 30lb reps would be a safe weight this strap can support for more than 4 days..."
1,Strap design,The product design does not have a welded D ring. The D ring can pull out during use. I purchased and tried to use and did not find it as a replacement for my Total Gym clone. The d ring opene during use and ws propelled several feet.
1,Very Weak Product,"I bought this for my laptop bag which likes to slide off my shoulder. This product didn't help at all and actually made matters worse, because it grabbed my shirt (on the shoulder) and pulled on my shirt. So instead of just having to hitch the laptop back up every 10 steps, now I still have to hitch the laptop but in addition adjust my shirt & collar every 10 steps.Can't recommend this project because it didn't help keep my bag in place."
3,for sliding shoulder straps not extra comfort of heavy strap,I thought this would be comfortable as a cushion for a heavy shoulder strap/bag but it's not. It does stay in place but you need to adjust it perfectly secure on shoulder and it will hold...it's rubber and not cushioned.
2,Awkward Shoulder Strap Pad,"The device works. It helps pad the load and keeps the strap from slipping off my shoulder. However, it's awkward to attach, it's unattractive, and it's bulky. I later purchased a Air Cell Lined Velcro Shoulder Strap Pad, and it works great, is lighter, less bulky, and more attractive."
2,Does its job but leaves ugly black rubber marks all over clothes,"This product does its advertised job by reducing the strain of carrying around heavy computer cases and similar items. Unfortunately has the very bad habit of leaving rubber on those clothes. By rubber I mean the type that becomes part of the sport jacket or shirt (i.e., becomes ingrained). This is especially the case if your computer bag is heavy, you have to walk long distances and you wear light colored clothing. Had to get rid of it."
2,Of limited use,"There is a small number of good uses for this pad, primarily for something that absolutely has to be supported on your shoulder, for a limited period, and which you won't want to shift around. As noted by others, its soft rubber catches on hair and clothing and it is awkward to shift around: in order to slide it forward or back, it has to be off the shoulder; getting onto either shoulder requires setting the pad in place and only then letting it take up the load--which means that shoulder-to-shoulder transfers require some dexterity. Also, contrary to the manufacturer's specs, it doesn't really accommodate a 2"" strap unless that strap is fairly light and flexible; it does not, for instance, work with the 2"" strap of my Timbuk2 computer bag or larger messenger bag. And it is also problematic with narrow, thin straps, which don't really stay in place all that well. I tend to leave it in my shoulder-carried ""suiter"" bag for those times when my gate is really far from the airport exit."
3,Ortho,Takes more time then just slinging your bag strap over your shoulder. You have to place this part on your shoulder before you move on.
4,"Big, made for heavy loads","I purchased this hoping to just have something to stop my purse from slipping. (Am I the only one who has this problem? There isn't much on the market for this.) Item is about 5"" long and a few inches wide. It is just way too much overkill for a purse. I highly recommend it if you are carry heavy loads, but not for a purse."
2,not what I thought,"I have only used these twice for a total of about 40 pictures. I am sure once I use them more the quality will improve. I was disappointed when I realized that what you see in the binocular is NOT what the picture will be. To frame the picture you must use the LCD screen, which is impossible to see in sunlight. I suggest getting either a good digital camera with high zoom or good binoculars not a combination, until this tecnology improves. The binoculars are very good by themselves.The camera is difficult to use."
5,Awesome pictures!,"I took some pictures the first day and they turned out great! 3.0 mp setting is best quality. Amazing how close up pictures turned out clear and crisp. The other reviewers statements about outdoor pictures being bad, HE'S WRONG they are better or as good as my nikon coolpix 775 2.0 mp. way to go meade!"
3,It is okay.,"I just got my meade binoculars/digital camera. I believe the binoculars are excellent. The camera part can use some work, but for a product in its infancy, its kind of fun. I am still testing the camera part, but I do believe the price is a little high. The casing is plastic, but it appears to be pretty sturdy. It is also a bit heavier than my celestron binocular/digital camera (with no LCD). Overall, for a little fun and something new it is okay. DEFINITELY, NEEDS TRIPOD CAPABILITY, WHICH THIS ITEM DOES NOT HAVE. IF YOU ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING AN ITEM SUCH AS THIS AND YOU REALLY NEED IT FOR SERIOUS PIX TAKING I WOULD NOT BUY THIS ITEM UNTIL THE TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES, BUT IF YOU WANT IT FOR FUN AND THE PRICE GOES DOWN A BIT, THEN GO FOR IT. I AM KEEPING MINE. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO ADVANCEMENT IN THIS FIELD."
1,an expensive toy but only a toy,"I had high hopes of using this instead of taking a more expensive and bulky camera out to the field in dog field trial events. Pictures are blurry. Videos are blurry. Not user friendly. I am a professional photographer, and I hope that photos that I take will result in identifiable images, so that someone that was not there can tell what it is I photographed. The camera portion does not live up to any reasonable expectations, and, while the binoculars are quite good, the overall weight with the 'camera' make the combination too heavy."
1,"pure, unadulterated junk","The camera is just plain cheap. Takes nothing but fuzzy, low resolution pictures. The thing weighs a ton and even for all that the binoculars are only mediocre. A great idea, maybe someday someone will actually do it right."
1,1.3MP version,"I bought the Meade CaptureView 8X42 1.3MP Digital Camera Binocular. The first one had software / hardware that hung up after 3 pictures, the second one had so many pixels missing from the screen it was unreadable, the third one wouldnt turn on and the black side flashing fell off on removal from the box.A truely tatty product"
3,Slight imperection,"I bought this item to block the vision in my right eye while driving; because of a recent surgery, I have differing vision in each eye which creates certain distortions. For the most part, the patch works fine and accomplishes my objective. However, the way the patch is sewn there is a slightly open seam which allows light in through the patch. Otherwise, it works fine."
3,works but not for me,Due to a cloudy lens implant that can no longer be fixed I tried an eye patch to prevent mixed signals to my brain with 20/20 vision in left eye & frosted viewing plus other undetermined debris reducing vision in right eye. I wear eyeglasses so with patch on outside of glasses there may be smearing or scratching of eyeglass lens (plastic). If I wear patch on inside of my eyeglasses then frames are pushed away from good eye & vision is affected.
2,Doesn't seal out light,"It's nothing more than folded over cloth-covered paper. The seam lets light in, so it is not effective as an eye patch."
5,Kindness Counts,"My two granddaughter carried these books around the whole time I visited, they even slept with them. Good messages and a great way to present them to small ones."
3,Shorter than I expected,"I got this set of books for my twin 3 1/2 year old girls. They love the Disney Princesses and books, so I figured this was a can't miss purchase. I also remember similar ""read along with tapes"" books when I was a kid.So when they came, I was a little disappointed that each book is only about 1 minute long per track on the CD. I was hoping they were going to be the 5-10 minute long books from my childhood, but unfortunately that is not the case. Each book has a quick lesson on various forms of kindness which are good in their own right, but I just wished they drew the stories out a little more."
4,"They keep their basics, better lyrics","Molotov was born blessed by the ones who like them and those who hate them. The attention they got for their first album made them a different option for the what you can call ""protest songs"" in the 60's. Although other Bands like Botellita de Jerez used the same language, Molotov took advantage of the media censure to sell their first record and prove they were good musicians. With this third album they prove that again, and although it's good to hear them again rapping and hardrocking, I'd appreciate some new experimentation."
3,esta bueno pero,"esta bien la tocada en este CD pero no cambia mucho, me gusta como convinan Rap con Ponk, le da mucho sentido de reveldia, apesar de que la musica no cambia lo que me atrae de ellos son la lirica que usan."
2,Buyer Beware!,"I purchase the game based on my experience of previous versions played on my older computer running XP. I carefully read all details of what system requirement information they supplied prior to my purchase. Generally, if a program supports Vista, it should do the same with Windows 7. To my dismay, after installing on my Windows 7 64-bit computer system, the games would not play. I could only see a black screen along with the music and sound effects.Talking with support, they are aware of customers reporting the problem, but have not been able to duplicate it. After some testing, I discovered the graphics controller was the culprit. A system running GeForce (otherwise, same system configuration), the game works great, but the system running an Intel(R) Graphics Media Accelerator HD failed to display the games.Conclusion, don't pay for ANY of Reel Deal slot games without confirming that it is FULLY compatible with your system."
5,Be a REAL High Roller....without leaving your house!!,"From table games to poker to slots, this game has it all. And the beauty of it is that you can purchase the other three games, and they all combine for multiplayer to form one huge casino.You can play tournaments 24/7 on all table, poker and slot games. I will add some screen shots from multiplayer. If you want to see more about the online community, please visit [...]!!"
2,love vegas,grafics are good slots are ok but if you like table games you spend more time at the cashier getting funds to play them in my opinion there must be something better
1,major rip off,You buy this disk thinking its complete for online play. But then they tell you you need 5 more disk to complete it
5,A Great Investment,"Love it, buy it. It's worth every penny. I love the tray the plate sets in. If you take a look at the pic up close, there are food cards underneath the plate. Those cards give you meal ideas. For anyone who is trying to get a grasp on their weight and portion management, this plate is a great investment."
3,Not bad for $17.00,I bought this plate a while ago and just recently found it again in my cabinet. It's easy to use and understand - you quickly realize that you've been eating too much when you measure out your food in the spaces on the plate for the first time.
1,Great idea poorly executed,"Like others who have bought this product, I was at first excited about how easy it was to use, then disgusted because within a week, the clear plastic plate insert cracked in two places. And the company who made the product doesn't warranty it and doesn't even produce it any more. Save your money and check out the American Diabetic Association that sells a plastic dish that has the same portion areas and costs MUCH less."
2,what a waste!,"To get to the point, I was very disappointed with this item. I've been battling with weight issues ever since I was a little girl and so I recently thought that portioning the food out would help in the battle. Although the item arrived on time and in mint condition, the plate became a nightmare to handle with trying to wash it and it cracked in less than two weeks. Now the plate is somewhere collecting dust in one of my cabinets and I turn to it in desperate situations when intake of food may be too much at a meal with my family. Excitement for this plate turned to massive disappointment!"
1,cracked compartment,"Received plate, well packaged. Seems great in theory, but while inspecting noticed one of the ""fat"" compartments had crack in it. Trying to contact manufacturer is nightmare, are they even operational? emailed for info, will just have to wait and see. This is first time I have reviewed any item, but felt it necessary to let everyone know you run a risk of defective merchandise."
1,Absolute Disaster,"Out of the box, this looked good. The place itself seemed to be of good quality, with the tray it sits in, a nice touch. However, upon first use of the plate in the microwave, the plate melted and deformed in various places, and that was in a much older microwave, that doesn't nearly put out the same power as todays new microwaves.In addition, the sauce from a tuna curry I made stained the plate and even with considerable elbow grease, the stain would not go away. I had to throw the plate away after the first use...COMPLETE waste of money, and cannot recommend. I took a chance even though I had read other reviews with the same problem because the sale price was pretty cheap, but I regret getting sucked in."
5,JC To The Top,This is a huge release from JC. A new studio CD with a full concert DVD in there also; 5/1 digital surround sound. This is the best of both JC worlds.
1,"Not a kids' Cartoon, Not a cartoon, not anything!","I thought this would be a cgi animation- it's some-bodies home editing project- some friends paintings, some lame photos, some friends soundtrack- totally bogus, what a burn! What is it doing here on amazon? LAME!!!!"
1,Never shipped- don't order,"I ordered this facial sauna from Amazon in December, but after three weeks the order still wasn't shipped. The new estimated delivery date was well into February, so I cancelled to order a similar product from Conair (which still has yet to be shipped). I have long been a customer of Amazon, but their customer service and delivery times have gradually been worsening."
5,Formatting Issues with the Book,"It has been brought to my attention that some of you have received an incorrectly typeset version of this book from the print-on-demand publisher. While the content is the same, I do apologize for any inconvenience that the printing issues may have caused you. Let me know how I can make it up to you. The next edition will be released by year-end. Sincerely, Sanjay."
4,Technology Regulatory Review,The book written by Sanjay Anand succinctly and clearly outlines the requirements of the SOX regulations. The specific duties and responsibilities of each function within an organization are outlined in detail that is easy to follow. The checklist approach facilitates compliance. The technology compliance elements detailed in the book make this book relevant for the technology professional as well as the compliance professional. The organization of the book guides the users experience through this complex regulation. I would recommend the book to individuals with the responsibility for SOX compliance in all enterprises.
4,"Decent substitute for ""Garage Band""","I purchased this product for my 15 year old son who was looking for a substitute for Garage Band for his Windows PC. He seems to be pretty happy with it, and I am glad he is no longer asking for an MacIntosh to replace his brand new PC :)"
1,Dissapointed,"Doesn't work with XP service pack ""3"".all I get is static like sound on laptop with windows vista;Might be the sound card but it doesn't work."
1,If there were negative stars I would give them,"Not only did this program prove to be a lame at best excuse for garageband, but it sucked as a program. It was slow and hard to interact and develop songs with. The worst thing about it is that you can't use your own computer audio setup, you have to use their weird USB gizmo that screws up your latency settings causing disgusting noise to blare through your speakers or headphones. This program proved to be a waste of money and a frustrating headache. If you are a garageband enthusiast DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM. Suck it up and learn how to use Propellerhead Studio's Reason, its well worth the money!"
5,An exceptional book!,"Marketing for King is a perfect guide to market yourself whether you are looking to get an internship, build a business, or find the job of your dreams. There are many excellent marketing books out there and this is one of the finest and the most readable. It's full of tips and tricks as well as overview material explaining the hows and whys of marketing. It's written in a very motivational and personal style. Overall, an outstanding book. Five Stars!"
5,Mentake: a rock,"Excellent! Je les ai vus LIVE, en concert et le site internet offre toutes leurs chansons! Génial!"
2,"Thin, stamped metal","I wonder how many of these get returned? It's not obvious from the pictures here, but these trays are thin sheets of steel, hot-stamped to be kind of shaped like a tray, and coated with nickel.Good points:(1) Nickel is shiny and doesn't need polishing like real silver, so it's relatively low maintenance.(2) They're sturdier than the thin plastic trays that the grocery story deli counter uses to package take-out stuff.Bad points:Just about everything else.If you're looking for a cheap, lightweight tray that nests beautifully with itself (it does make it easy to store dozens of them), then you've found it. If you're looking for something elegant and sturdy, keep looking.By the way, mine arrived with in the bag from the manufacturer, which says ""Suggested retail price: $19.99."" The MSRP is massively inflated. I'd guess that it's worth noticeably less than half of that price."
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I'd thought this would be ideal for small quantities of egg white or whipped cream, but given the large surface area of the bowl, the whipped product is spread out and it's tough to gauge the degree of whipped-ness achieved. I think that a hand mixer and small bowl will still work better for small quantities, and a mixer for large."
3,Not what I expected,I thought this was going to be a lid that you could screw on over the 'Straw thing' but it won't fit over that. You have to take that out before using the cap. So you end up with bottles with only milk in it and you have to keep everything else seperate. I've have a ton of regular lids that do the same thing. It would be handy to have a cap that you can take off and then screw on the nipple part and be ready to go.
4,fits,Fits medella bottles and are lot cheaper than the medella caps. Good to replace lost caps. will recommend to others.
5,Useful for many bottles,"I use these tops on my standard evenflo and gerber bottles. These are sturdier and bigger than the caps that I got from the Medela and the formula company samples at the hospital, which started to crack and break after a little use and had more problems with leaking."
4,Great for Medela and Gerber bottles!,"These caps fit perfectly to the gerber bottles and the medela bottles that came with my pump. They also fit much more securely than the medela caps since the Brown caps are deeper, so when you tighten them, you know they're actually on the bottle securely. I can't give it five stars because I don't know if they can withstand me dropping filled bottles on them- I already cracked one medela cap.."
1,A flawed design.,"I ignored DaveG's review and was sorry I did!Even during installation I thought it was a good product. BUT it was exactly as DaveG said, it would not hold my LCD TV up or down. The mount allows movement of about 90 degrees but would only stay in half of that range. The right-left rotation was fine. My TV was just 9 lb and the mount is rated for 15 lbs. Also I had to buy longer screws to attach the TV.It is possible to use this -- if you just HAVE TO have a under cabinet mount -- simply use a long screw with a wingnut to hold it in a fixed position. Likewise, you could hold it up by attaching a spring. Of course with this rigging you couldn't raise or lower it without a hassle.I finally put the TV back on the stand that it came with and left it on the countertop. Flipping it up and down would have been cool but this is not the product to do it with.I sent it back to Amazon for a refund. Now I have to cover up the holes I made in the kitchen cabinet."
1,Very Poor Product,"The review by DaveG ""hits the nail on the head"". This is a very poorly designed poduct and, after much work installing the product and tightening the tension screw TO NO AVAIL, I am contacting Sanus for a return and full refund.I believe Sanus generally makes quality equipment but not so in this case.RichS"
3,Not so easy to replace,"Odd sized Philip's/standard screws. Instructions are lacking (not that I needed them). Needs a wire stripping gage and the male and female are different sized wire cuts. Male and female have same instruction sheet. If they ditched the instructions and simply put a gage on the inside of the outlet I'd give it another star. Also not so easy to replace having to do trial and error. I'd buy again, and would suggest you order two of each so you can figure it out, and have a spare in case it breaks. Send the unused ones back to Amazon within 30 days for a hassle free experience. I put a scan of the English instructions on the photo page."
2,Listing on Amazon is incorrect or the packaging is!,"I ordered 2 of these plugs for extension cords. When I got then they were Cooper Wiring Devices Rotating Angle plugs with a sticker, probably put on by Amazon, showing the information from the Amazon listing. I'll probably use them at some point, but now I have to run to the hardware store to buy 2 plugs to complete my project. They may be a great product, but they are not as the listing shows!"
1,5-15 R? Not,"Based on the photo, this is a 5-15C. Not a 5-15R as the title says, Not a 5-15P as the description says. C stand for Cap. The difference between a Cap (C) and a Receptacle (R) is that C install on a cord end and R installs in an outlet box. P stands for Plug. P is the male end and it plugs into R or C. I recommend buying from people who know enough about their product to list it correctly. If you purchase this, I would say you have a 33% chance of getting what you expect since its claiming to be 3 different things."
4,Fun film with a good soundtrack.,"Good, small film made by independent filmmakers. Talented cast and good original songs. Hope to see more from the cast and those involved with the production. Give it a shot. Also try to support their new internet series ""Easy Abby""."
1,really?,"I like musicals and I like most movies. Just not when they put random off key songs in. The actual story line was great, but the singing killed it. Without the singing I would have rated a 3.5 easy maybe even a 4."
3,...interesting,"This was an incredibly well written, well cast movie, interspersed with some absolutely terrible musical numbers. I would probably watch this movie again, maybe even recommend it to friends, I would just warn them first about the strange parts. I thought the story was great, and overall I really enjoyed it."
2,Jamie and Jessie,"This was an okay movie, the actresses were average, and if they were much more attractive, it would have changed my rating all together."
2,"Not camp, just sad","In a nutshell: It's a lesbian movie. There are sex scenes. There are songs. None of it's good though.I always watch lesbian films with an open mind and low expectations. I wanted to like this, really I did.My girl and I sat down to watch this and were sorely disappointed and suffered physical discomfort from how unfortunate this movie was.---Highlights---The musical numbers go for too long and are very sadly written.There are 3 sex scenes. The first one is pretty uncomfortable because it isn't key in the plot it seems just thrown in there for the sake of a sex scene. The second was also awkward, but not as bad because it made sense with the story. The last was supposed to be climactic because it's the hero and the love interest getting together but it wasn't that great.There are some funny moments, though. But the stereotypes are pretty bad and during one of the dance numbers they talk about ""loads"" and it's the last thing I expected in a lesbian film... #justsaying"
2,Poorly designed but a great idea awaiting improvement,"I pre-ordered this binocular/camera gizmo a few months before it was available, anxious for its release. I got it a few months late, but here are my thoughts. While it's certainly a great idea spotting that unusual bird and snapping a close up photo of it. Unfortunately this particular product is one of those made by the same people who design tippy, shallow beverage holders for cars. Just a little more thinking on the part of the designer would lead to a drink holder that will hold a beverage upright in a moving vehicle. Similar problems with the Meade binocular here. For example: the camera runs by batteries which the instructions recommend you remove each time after you use the camera. Better design would include an on-off switch. Would you buy a battery operated radio if you had to remove the battery after each use?I returned this product for refund, though I do look forward to future revisions. :)"
1,Gave it as a Christmas present didn't work,Not good a waste of money it didn't work. No power went to the camera so it did not work. Son in Law took it on Vacation useless.
2,Capture View,"Instructions very poor. For exam ple, instr. do not tell you that batteries must be in camera and camera must be ""on"" in order to download to PC. Also not told that if you take batteries out ,will lose any pictures still in camera. Maybe this is elemenetary to a camera buff but not to a novice like myself.Battery contacts in battery compartment not well designed or installed. Hard to make contact to activate camera.One spring terminal was ""bent"" when I got camera and had to be straightened to get battery in. Sometimes batteries will make contact and sometimes not.Judging by the few pictures that I have been able to view, picture quality seems to be good, however.I'd like a replacement but not sure how to expediently accomplish this."
1,"awful item, amazon has awful service - beware!","I ordered this item as a gift and it wouldn't take any pictures. Very disappointing. I tried to contact customer service here at amazon, and was promised to have a box out to return the item, but now, a couple months later, I have not received any way to return the item and amazon will not return my emails!!!! I am so dissapointed with this shopping experience and now have a broken item AND an extended warranty I purchased. Think twice about shopping through this site!!!"
3,Little too 70's groovy...,Still the sound of the skinheads but when it all started to fade. A lot of fantastic tracks but some of the music starts to turn towards the rasta reggae. It loses me there. Still a great buy. Check out the Trojan Skinhead Reggae box set and Dancehall '69.
1,Not worth the time,I can't say much about this except that there wasn't much to remember. The characters are not developed and seem quite shallow.
5,Adorable Blue Eyes!!,"This is a very nice kitty, very good at being a companion. He has cute blue eyes with black pupils. He has a nice soft fabric and is very durable. He has a pink nose and wiskers. If you like cats this is the one for you."
1,ingredients not listed,There are many ingredients NOT listed for those of you like my husband who has allergies he can not have this products and it is NOT returnable.
1,"Beware, true X-men fans!","The character of Sammy is one of the highlights of this story arc, but any REAL X-men fan should RUN! QUICKLY! at any sign of the name Chuck Austen on an X-men comic... See other reviews for additional details, I can't bear the memory of having paid money for this..."
4,Very good!,"If you wanna know about the first 8th Air Force Fighter Group equipped with P-51 in WW II, this is the book. Since their training and first combat and losses, is everything here. THe appendix are fantastic, including all the dead, wounded and missing pilots, and all the claims and commanders. Great job. It has a lot of pictures, of course."
4,Cute little penguin,"We ordered this as a stocking stuffer for our daughter so it hasn't been played with, yet. It sure looks cute and I am sure it will be enjoyed."
4,"Smaller than expected, but cute","There was not a size listed in the amazon description, but it is quite small. A little over two inches tall. But it works nicely and is durable. The kids love it and I am still glad I bought it. I probably would not choose this over other Plan Toys items simply because it cost almost $10 after shipping and it is very small."
3,Has Good Info But Doesn't Have Any Color Pictures,"I found the book to have a good amount of information covering the Minolta Maxxum 7D camera plus general info covering photography. It has pictures showing the controls and a reasonable index to find things. The DiMAGE Viewer software is mentioned and also some info about working with images I found to be helpful.The only negative thing about the book I found so far, really, is that there are no color photos at all! Black and white pictures of flowers and of other things, for instance, I feel is strange. The book would be substantially better if it had color photos."
4,Real Value-added,Definitely goes beyond the owners manual providing useful perspective on how to get more out of the numerous controls and customizing options for this fine camera. Also a useful guide for improving your photos.
2,Songs are not full length versions,"You are probably better getting the albums ""Forever Your Girl"" and ""Spellbound"" to get the full length versions (not single versions on this CD) of her #1 hits, in particular my favorite, ""Opposites Attract."""
4,Nearly super with all except last album's songs,"So like Paula for looks, energy and dance, but the last album songs just did not get me moving and inspired...love the early material."
3,music to go,we downloaded this to add to our long playlist of music on the go to keep us entertained when the moment called for it :)
3,Best of Paula,I bought this to add to my collection of classic rock. Some of it is more hiphop but the songs were all over the radio in the 80s.I enjoy it as a change of pace every now and then.
1,What the heck?????,"I don't understand why they had to come out with another Paula Abdul's greatest hits album. I know it's been about 7 years from her other greatest hits album, but there is nothing special about the new one. It pretty much has the same songs and almost has the same cover. I mean she is wearing the same outfit. I really love Paula Abdul's songs so I sticking with her first greatest hits album. Why should we waste money on a greatest hits album that has one or two more new songs when we can stick with the orginal greatest hits album.I just want to say that the one star is not because of Paula Abdul, it is because they had to come out with another greatest hits album with the almost the same cover and her wearing the same outfit."
4,A fun read,"Unlike the other reviewers here, I have not read any of the author's other works...yet. I did find this book very entertaining though, so if Kun's other books are similar in style I'm sure I'll enjoy. I did however find a few things wrong in this text. I'm looking over my shoulder and find no girlfriend around, I hope that the significant others of Kun and Howard, and their editor for that matter aren't around. I don't want to embarrass them. First of all, Big and Little Poison are the nicknames of the Waners (Paul and Lloyd) NOT the Wagners (Honus and Lloyd(?)). Also, is was Tug Mcgraw that said he'd never smoked artificial turf, not Ken Brett. There were a couple of other things wrong here, but as I said it was an enjoyable read and even found myself laughing out loud at times."
3,Some Good Stuff,"I enjoyed this book. But, seemingly not as much as previous reviewers. The basic format was from A (David Aardsma) to Z (Dutch Zwilling) with quite a bit in between. Particularly, I liked the sections on major league playing brothers,the pitch count,the hidden ball trick,manager Preston Gomez twice lifting pitchers in the process of throwing no-hitters that had gone eight innings,Phil Linz playing the harmonica from the back of the team bus after the Yankees had lost a game,pitcher Wilson Alvarez's no hitter in his second major league game. In his first start he retired no batters. All in all a worthwhile addition to a baseball fans library."
5,Baseball? Ugh!,"I don't like baseball, okay. Shoot me. I think it's silly and boring, and I'd rather watch paint dry than waste three hours watching a bunch of guys standing around waiting for someone to hit a ball to them. But, after reading Mr. Kun's breakout novel ""You Poor Monster,"" which had me laughing and crying and thinking for months, I'm willing to see where he'll lead me. Even if it means (ugh!) having to read about baseball. Having read a sample chapter of the book on Mr. Kun's ridiculously funny website, I can say that I love the book already. If his story about how he and his friends used their knowledge of baseball to cheat on math tests doesn't get a laugh out of you, you're in big trouble. A warning to Mr. Kun, though: we may follow you when you want to write about baseball, but don't push it too far. If your next book is about figure skating, you can count me out. Maybe."
1,Had to stop reading it,"I certainly can picture the two authors in a room together cracking each other up at things that no one else would find funny.It sounded like a good idea, and I was excited to read it.It was neither entertaining nor informative.Boredom fully set in around page 40. Had to put it down."
2,"a ""told to"" autobiography","This is a book I think inspired by My Quarter Century of American Politics, by Champ Clark(which I read 25 Jan 1989), but it is not as good a book. Cannon tells of incidents but is very chary of dates and obviously did no particular research for the book--he just told his secretary things and his secretary arranged them in a roughly chronolgical order. There is of course not a footnote nor a bibliography. Cannon glories in being a standpatter, and is opposed to anything new. He deprecated Wilson giving the State of the Union address in person because it had not been so done for a hundred years. But the book is easy reading and kind of fun to read."
2,Right Wing Christian Textbook,"Stacey's book is a text from a series designed by evangelical Christians. I wouldn't have ordered it if I had known that, but this small book may still have some use as a brief introduction to Blackstone. It serves up an ideological view of the man the right-wingers are adopting as a founding father for their take on the Constitution. Read with a great grain of salt. Less than 100 pages of text."
2,Christianbooks.com?,"I want to thank Mr. Kremer for altering me to ACW press. Put ACW Press in google and you get christianbooks.com, a press with a strange (and apparently right wing book) list. [When I went to the site, they were peddling a book about Saddam Hussein being an evil-doer extraordinaire--even if true, what does that have to do with Christianity? Nothing, of course--it's just right-wing justification for Bush's disastrous unneccessary war.]"
2,Not Glazed,"I had thought that this would be glazed, just like the Sango Nova pitchers I'd bought. Also, the product picture and description gave me the impression that it was glazed.The only part that is glazed is the very small ""splash"" part of the design on each side. The entire rest of the pitcher is very rough and raw -- both inside and out.Is it possible that I received a defective unit? If so, I beg for an owner of this item to pleasepleaseplease post that clarification. (I could then simply order a replacement.) Otherwise I'll have to view that the whole line of Sango Splash pitchers is like the one I received - ie with this rough texture that is abrasive to the touch."
4,How Biblical Languages Work Silzer & Finley,"Typical ""American Style"" textbook starting from the basics (especially viz-a-viz grammar) which took me back to Latin class 50 years ago. Lots of interest which I'm still digesting so its probably unfair to be so critical so early. Good book for the beginner."
3,Decent low entry camera for the home user,"I bought this camera several months ago when the selection of low cost, hi resolution, USB cameras was very poor. While the camera performs nicely the images tend to be a little washed out and the flash not truly effective in dark areas. The USB cable dumps images into the computer quickly and easily -- far superior to the serial cable most cameras rely on (also included with the 800). The camera also acts as a web cam which makes up for some of the other things it lacks. Camera is not very ergonomic and at times feels awkward in your hand. But, overall, perfect for posting images to the web."
2,Weak Medicines,"A sometimes enticing alternative record, ""Sanctuary Medicines"" combines rock, trip-hop, metal, dance, funk, electronica, spoken word, pop, grunge and industrial/ goth. Yes, all these styles in one album. And does it work? Hmmmmm, not very well. Most of this music has been done before and better by bands like Nine Inch Nails, Massive Attack or Prodigy, so Rico has nothing all that new to offer. ""Sanctuary Medicines"" provides some experimentalism at parts, yet it becomes derivative anyway and fails to impress. There are some good songs here nonetheless, like the enticing single ""Smokescreen"" or the desperate and dark ""Float"". Still, for the most part this effort is not very memorable or innovative and ends up being another uneven rock album.Nothing special."
5,A Helpful Book For Psychologists,This book explores the world of growing up in a never before seen way. Jonathan Cohen took his longtime study of people and made into a helpful and informational book. I reccomended this book to anyone interested in unconventional and new psychology studies.
4,This book is hilarious!!!!!!!,"This book is sooooo funny even though it's not english-italian. The is books has all of the perverted comments made about (""THINGS""). I'm sure you'll love this book."
2,Dictionary of Italian Slang,Buyer Beware: There is no English to Italian section in this dictionary as there are in normal academic foreign language dictionaries. i.e. There are ONLY Italian Slang to English translations.
3,Beautiful art direction,"Much of the pleasure of watching a Roman epic is getting away from modernity to an age when the most awesome thing you could encounter was a rearing horse, and nights were utterly silent, broken only by the sound of lyres and tambors. Nero takes you into such a world, and conveys the tragedy of the very young Nero (17 when he took office), manipulated into power by his mother. For several years, his rule was benign, but after the army destroyed his household for him, he turned to drugs and sex and Hitlerian visionary schemes. He is said to have crucified countless Christians, blaming them for setting Rome ablaze. Left utterly alone, he ignominiously took his own life. A powerful drama of the empire verging on chaos."
1,grossly inaccurate and dull,"What this movie presents is a monumental missed opportunity to tell a fascinating story of the corruption of power on the grandest scale in history. The historical innaccuracies are too numerous to even attempt to list. This film is surprisingly generous to the dreaded historical ""antichrist."" His well documented peculiarities including perverse sexual tastes and cruelty as well as his obsessive belief in his divine artistic gifts are largely glossed over. So this movie is not only innaccurate, it is also a snoozefest. The focus on a relationship he had with a slave takes the bulk of the expositional time preventing more interesting elements of the story and his character from developing. Maybe hollywood will give nero the big budget treatment he deserves in the future. I would actually rate this one 1 and a half stars because the production is not bad and the cast are not bad. The movie fails more from the conceptual basis it rests on."
2,Boring,"I learned nothing about Nero`s life from watching this movie. It is a story about a man who wants to live a simple and happy life but his mother has bigger plans for him. So she kills many people in order for her son to become Roman Emperior. Perhaps a better title for this movie would be ``Nero`s mother.`` It`s a fairy story about prophecy, Nero`s mother, and Nero`s relationship with a slave girl. Instead of a movie about one of the worlds most interesting historical figures."
1,"Terrible, just terrible","Nero as a tragic, romantic hero? Avoid this at all costs! Just awful. I had to give it one star to post this review, but it doesn't even deserve that."
2,Spaghetti Romans,"So this is what's happened to the 'Spaghetti Western'.Dreadful acting, historically inaccurate, un-researched, self-serving drivel.Caligula's fun, though he lives about seven years too long...(ahem... timeline folks...)Sets aren't bad, costumes adequate.Overall, not worth a rental. One expects Lee Marvin to ride in at any second saying ""Howdy pa'dner""."
2,Historical accuracy ignored,"I recently read an ariticle in Variety entitled ""Irritated Italos give HBO's ROME the thumbs down"". It seems there were qualms about historical accuracy with one Italian newspaper calling it ""a prime example of historical misinformation"". I wonder what the Italians think oftheir ""home grown"" TV mini-series IMPERIUM which has so far spawned ""Augustus"" and ""Nero""? There is more historical inaccuracy in these two films than almost all the previous Hollywood style epics put together. Compared to ""Augustus"" and ""Nero"", ROME is a documentary...plus it is entertaining, which these film are not. The two stars I've given are for production values alone."
2,A nice story ... BUT...,"A nice story, but not historically accurate. The attempt to link Nero to Christian Theological may be a bit much in Nero's case. Also, Caligula reigned for about 3 years, this story infers that Caligula had about a 10 year reign. Nevertheless, it's a fair work of fiction. The DVD Caligula, may be more accurate -- hope you could stomach it, esp. the unrated version."
5,High speed punk picks you up and keeps you going,A friend of mine bought this CD and the first time he let me hear it was when we were driving on a highway in belgium. After a few songs we noticed that the car was going a lot faster than was technically allowed. The music is so fast and furious that everything else around you just seems to slow down. Most bands on this CD I had never heard of and I might never hear of them but what they did on this CD will make me pay attention when I hear something else they made.
4,Woof!,"What a cutie! Just look at his floppy face and wrinkles! And his black muzzle, eyes, and ears just scream cuteness! Though maybe not of the highest quality, I consider him one of the cuter Ty dogs."
2,complex,"While the author gives many, many, many page references to flip forward or back in the volume while discussing his different points, the organization is so indirect as to make it problematic to read. I have the gut feeling that the author has jumped to his own conclusions (some unsupported or long-reaching) and keeps the reader off-balance with the indirect though lines. I don't recommend this unless you have the time and inclination to wade through the rhetoric."
4,"At Last, From the Bard's Own Lips...","There is no true study of the Celts or of Druidry that omits the work of the Bards themselves. While we may all await with baited breath an English translation of the Four Ancient Books of Wales, Matthews has provided us with substantial, fresh, sensitive translations of much of Taliesin's work. An indispensible volume."
4,Hard but fun read.,"This books is a great read, although tainted with the stench of xtian thought. You could read it and still savor all the european pagan delights..."
2,No practical criticism here,"The reader expects to see some useful applications of feminist theory to ancient texts, but the expectation is in vain."
4,On the issue of drugs in the black community,"Dei's book, written in simple language, cannot fail to arouse considerable interest among anthropology, sociology, and criminal justice students, as well individuals who are interested in working with youths. Dei draws a wealth of knowledge from a minority community as he thoroughly investigates and elucidates the drug phenomenon. He shows how drug use is integrated into the ordinary lives of people, a contrast to the dark images of black drug users typically portrayed in the media."
1,Pain in the digital world,"Poor design. Requires unique software to download, requires a unique cord. This product really missed the boat when it comes to portability from one computer to another. Come on engineers, you can do better than this."
5,Fun,"I have most of Agatha Christie's books. I think both David Suchet and Joan Hickson are perfect actors for the parts. The movies don't necessarily follow the books, but they are great fun and entertainment."
1,This is an item being sold which won't even list the contents!,"It is ridiculous to lest for sale a collection without listing the titles! Do not buy this as, unless you have never bought Joan Hickson/David Suchet movies before, you probably already have these titles."
5,Agatha Christie: Poirot & Marple Crime Anthology Collection (2011),"I received it three days earlier than Amazon estimated. Since the titles are not advertised in the item description, I was so hoping that Miss Marple's ""Nemesis"" would be included -- and it is! Haven't played any of them yet, and there are more Poirot than Marple, but I know I am going to be quite pleased.

4,good for a while,"I have to keep buying these because we keep getting mold on ours even using sanitatize mode on our dishwasher. Once the mold starts there is no getting rid of it and you have to throw it out. I wrote the company and got one free set of inserts, then they just ignored me after that. I've found if you rinse them with water after using them they should be OK. If that doesn't work, try soaking in vinegar. The only solution is prevention... there is no getting rid of the black spots once they appear. We continue to use the Dr. Brown's bottles because we believe it helps with gas/colic but you have to calculate the constant cost of new rubber inserts into the purchasing decision."
4,Yay they got rid of the two notches!,I'm so happy that Dr. Brown wised up and removed the two notches from the underbelly. The spots were hard to clean even with the mini-brush. Now there is just a nice smooth circular area. YAY!
3,"If the bottle's leaking, just replace these","I like Dr. Brown's Natural Flow bottles over any other baby bottles, but I feel like it leaks after a certain while and have to replace these inserts more often. Cleaning isn't a big deal, but those brushes that originally came with the bottles don't last very long."
2,Mold Grows in These,"I have had to replace these twice now because of mold growing on these inserts despite my best efforts to clean with the tiny scrubbers that come with the bottles and boiling to sanitize. It's too late in the game to invest in a new brand of bottles as my twins should be done with bottle in the next couple of months, so I will just replace these as needed. We loved these bottles for the fact that our girls rarely got gas once we found the right bottle and formula. Too bad this part is really hard to clean and keep clean! If it weren't for that, these bottles & inserts would have gotten 5 stars from me."
2,hard to clean,"After cleaning these internal pieces for a year, I would not buy these inserts or the bottles again. Sometimes they would not come clean at all even after buying the special brush and boiling them. Although the bottles work well, I can't believe the work is worth it."
5,A Must,"These Inserts have to be replaced after awhile as I realized that they can develop mold in the tiny chambers or compartments, that will not come out even with the little brushes provided with the bottle product."
1,it's a piece of junk,"this is a piece of junk. I bought three, all of them have problems and work intermittently. buy a different one."
2,i have mixed feeling about this flick,it doesn't know weather it want's to make rap out to be a useless outlet or praise it.plus the idea of a record ceo being right about the arguement he had with the rappers was laughable.maybe they was trying to be un biased buy telling his side of the story.but it camed off as a anti rap movie.oh and lets not start on the suburban middle aged white women who said there music was garbage?.and then offered them coffee.like she gives a [darn] about them making good or bad quality rap.
4,Great X-men Book,Chuck Ausitn continues his great storytelling in the dominant species story arc. Also Kia Asamiya matches the great story with amazing artwork. The X-men Have never before loked so good. This book is a must have for x-men fans.
4,Great X-men Book,Chuck austin continues his great storytelling during the dominant species stroy arc. Also Kia Asamiya provides amazing artwork. The x-men have hever looked so good. Great characterization only adds to this book. A must have for x-men fans.
3,Intresting mainly to see the differeces among the authors...,"This book is an interesting window on the Open Source world. It is a strange planet with strange people. Some crazy idealist like R. Stallman (I like the guy very much), some smart and intelligent person like L. Torvald (he did a very good job with Linux). In between someone that was just in the right place at the right time, but who doesn't deserve so much space and celebrity. I am talking about a person that seems confused as the language he invented: Larry Wall. His contribution does not require further comments."
4,Good background material to the open source movement,"It's general background and overview material and even if you don't like all articles (I disliked the one by Larry Wall, sorry, Larry, I do like Perl), it's a definite buy for people interested in software development methods in general or free software development in particular.Mind you, it's not a scientific or very theoretical book, but it does have some opinions and theories in it (Richard Stallman, Eric Raymond, Bruce Perens, Tim O'Reilly).So, if you like theory on software development, it's a definite buy. If you're a hacker already, well maybe, but you might already know parts of it.Finally, there is definitely some anti-MS sentiment in there. However maybe it's just anti-baddd-software. Anyway, just so you know....As far as I am concerned: buy, buy, BUY!"
2,Regressive progressions,"2 1/2Stacked high with experimental atmospherics, 1984 is a worthwhile throwaway with precious little compositional backbone to wrap around."
5,Does exactly what it should!,I am new to embroidery and saw this product in a YouTube video. I have used it several times on various items and it works perfectly!
3,good concept but poor fitment,"This is a great idea but the fitment into the receiver is a little poor . I have a 09 GMC and it has an original equipment receiver on it . There is about a quarter inch worth of play in it when installed so it rattles around pretty good . I put a shim in it and it seems to work well . I would not put too much in it for adding a light trailer off the hitch but if you stay very light you should be OK . I think it is a great concept , easy to use but quality control is an issue in my opinion ."
2,4 wheeler tie down,"This item is very heavy. The bottom tongue Sticks out from the bumper real far, this keeps you from driving off road into dips and valleys. I would not buy this product unless you have a truck with a lift kit. I had to modify mine to make it user friendly and more theft proof. However this product secures the 4 wheeler very well."
1,Very disappointing,"Was looking forward to reading this book. I thought I finally found a book about Filipino women who made a difference across professions and borders. I was quite disappointed, however, at finding most of the pieces too self-congratulatory. It's really too bad. Could've been a truly inspiring book."
4,Pretty great stuff!!,I am not able to take any prescription diet pills due to migraine headaches. I have tried so many products I can't even keep count . Curvelle has been a little miracle in a bottle for me. It actually works to curb my appetite and I have more energy as well. I love food and it's so hard to stop snacking at night but this product does the trick for me! So glad I found it. The only reason I gave 4 stars rather than 5 is because I have to take 2 pills 2 times per day to get the benefits.
1,Didnt work for me,I've been using this product for about two weeks now and so far there has beenno change. It's probably not the right one for me because i have read lots of good reviews about it.
