3,Briskly told story with questionable objectivitiy,"Deep Cover is a briskly told insider tales of a drug bust gone bad -- through the government agencies who launched it also touted how successful the operation was in their press releases. This is really a story of the failure of the drug wars. My main quibble is that the author injects too much italized commentary about his views about the failure of the drug wars; it made me wondered how much of the story was slanted as well, since everything is definitely filtered from that point of view."
4,Very informative and sobering,Michael Levine gives the reader the inside scoop on why certain agencies and certain targets don't seem to show up during the war on drugs. I read this book years ago and found myself infuriated by the in-fighting and lack of cooperation between agencies and agents. Excellent read and likely to disappoint those of us who believe everything is being done to fight the war on drugs.
1,Unlistenable,"I'm not sure what this is, but it contains some of the worst singing I have ever heard. This man is tone deaf. Staggering, and unbearable."
1,Pretentious college music,"Joyner is the archtype of the DIY artist whose moanings about his ""sensitivity"" belong in an unpublished poetry journal, not foisted upon the public."
3,It's fine for a rainy day reading,This is a nice story which can put you right on the couch next to him as you read. It's not all that unique a story though.
5,Owe my Soul,Excellent read if you wondering about the number of bankruptcies or have been puzzled about the decline in real wages over the last few decades. It may make you think twice about your own finances!
4,DROWNING IN DEBT,"IN 2OO3, OVER 1.6 MILLION AMERICANS FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY. OVER 33% OF THE AMERICANS THAN OWN A HOME ARE ONE PAYCHECK AWAY FROM FORECLOSURE. Is it that hard to believe that America is fastly becoming a nation of debtors. Even more interesting, the government actually promotes it by slack regulations, unnaturally low interest rates, and a willingness to keep Americans spending. This book does a fantastic job in helping anyone understand just how bad it is, and just how blind we as Americans are to the situation. 4 STARS! - Mason Johnson, President, www.tomorrowsgold.com"
1,A Rehash,Rehashes their earlier book and reiterates the same tautology: too much debt causes bankruptcy.
4,Great Value Player,"I just got this today and it is working great. The buttons can be unresponsive, or just take a while when you push them, but that is to be expected for an mp3 player of this value. This is great if you like recording off the radio, like me.There are 3 recording settings, all WAV unfortunatly. Low is best for radio talk shows. Normal and High are great for music.Overall a great value player"
2,A strange experience...,"They're both brilliant violinists but in very different genres, and Menuhin by his own admission never learned to improvise (unlike many of today's classical performers): he was trained in the post-Liszt, pre-jazz window when improvisation had died out in classical music and even cadenzas followed the score strictly (if Beethoven didn't write one, play Kreisler's). And it shows, rather painfully. He achieves a brilliant tone but that's about it: he plays these Broadway tunes completely ""straight"", and any student could do that equally well.The CD is worthwhile for its curiosity value, but you'd get much better musical value buying Grappelli's jazz and Menuhin's classical recordings separately."
3,"Doodle Doug = cute, but not too impressed.","My 5 yr-old daughter, who loves crafts, picked this item out for her birthday. It is a cute toy, however, she lost interest very quickly. You MUST make sure the markers are pushed in securely so the ink can create the pattern. Since it only came with three markers we tried other markers at home but no other markers would stay in. Any clue where to purchase more colors for this item, or even replacements? For the stamps, I would suggest using ink pads rather than trying to color the bottom of the shoes. Overall, cute item but not too impressed."
2,Waste of money,"My 3 year old daughter wanted this because she saw it on TV. She played with it the day we brought it home and hasn't asked for it since. The pens were hard to fit in, the foot stamps didn't really work well, either. We made a big page of drawings on some newsprint paper and then after the pens ran dry because she forgot to cap them, and I have no idea if replacements are even sold. Later that day we just forgot about him being a drawing toy and just played with him as if he was a big plastic bug. Now he's back in the box. I wish I would have saved my money and bought a drawing board or maybe a nice Spirograph. I always try to avoid gimmicky toys like these but it seems I can't quite ever learn the lesson."
2,Chaotic toy,"This toy seemed like a fun idea, however it is utter chaos. The toy moves randomly over the page and does not make any sort of comprehensive design. Actually our table received more ink than the paper and then the kids could not get it to turn off. I think it may be slightly posessed!"
2,REPLACEMENT MARKERS!!!!!,"Apparently there are quite a bit of parents out there just as disappointed as I am. My sons love the doodle doug so do I, the best paper of ALL by the way is easel paper it works great and the designs are so pretty...HOWEVER... there is NO WHERE to get replacement markers (ya know to replace the 3 CHEAP ones that come with it???). I'm at the point where I'm taking a trip to the art store and comparing each and every one until I find some that work!!!"
3,Its Ok,"Downside is that when the markers run out you are screwed since the holes are specialy made for the markers it comes with, kinda bummed about that. But the kids do Love it, just make sure you use BIG paper."
2,Moody but Confusing,"I'm still not sure what happened at the end, and I don't feel inclined to watch it again. The plusses? Well-photographed with some nice moody Tex-Mex scenes. Sam Shepard I liked as the friendly cigar smoking sherrif. Val Kilmer was OK but it would have killed him to wash his hair? The female roles were OK and predictable. The American movie industry again tries to persuade us that a multiple killer/assassin hired to shoot the President; who in one flashback kills a man in front of his child; and in another murders a victim in a confessional, is just a little misunderstood and needs the right woman to set him straight. Aw shucks who couldn't forgive that toothy grin."
2,Who is the man in the red car? More importantly who cares?,"If you've seen one thriller of this type you've seen them all. Well, at least you've seen this one. Uninteresting. Unoriginal. Implausible. I wasted two hours of my life so you don't have to. Of course, if you've never ever seen a movie or TV show before you might find this interesting. But if you have, be warned."
3,decent popcorn movie,"I hunted this movie down for my own personal Kilmerfest, but it really grew on me. The characters are interesting, sometimes novel, and the writing and acting is strong enough to support rewatches to spend time with them. Decent popcorn movie."
5,Val Kilmer Scores Again!!,"I will have to say that Val Kilmer has done it again. His choice of movies recently have been nothing short of spectacular and all of them have been thoroughly enjoyable. Following up on Wonderland and Spartan, Kilmer portrays a man fallen victim to his own mind as he tries to piece together a memory fragmented by violence that will eventually lead him to a seemingly unthinkable crossroads. If you enjoyed Wonderland and Spartan and that ""who is doing what to whom"" type of movie, than Blind Horizon is for you. You won't be disappointed."
2,disappointing,"Preece has a lot to say about the casual violence of Royal Marines in bar fights and bullying and virtually nothing to say about training, exercises, and active service in Northern Ireland. The retelling of a life composed mostly of punch-ups and boozing gets boring fast."
3,Dunno,"Okay, before you get mad or anything, this is JUST MY OPPINION: I rated this toy 3 overall, it would've been five but her outfit!...Okay I really don't care for her outfit, it looks like something the My Scene girls wouldn't wear! Sorry Chels :DI love her bathing suit and makeup and everything else tho, and if you've ever seen That's So Raven, you may think that she looks like Raven's friend Chelsea (I think she does). Did I mention I love her bathing suit :P That's all!Stop the My Scene/Bratz conflict!Thanx for reading#1 My Scene fan"
5,Awesome toy!!,I think that Chelsea is very pretty. She has an awesome bathing suit. I think that her makeup is cool. I love Chelsea!!! She rocks!
1,it BURNS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i can't stand to look at her hurably ugly clothes let alone her face
1,What Are You People Gushing Over?!,This doll is just plain boring (and that bow on her shirt is so asinine!). Who is coming up with the fashions for the my scene dolls? Who ever they are they need to get real. The real fashion dolls are the Bratz... thier clothes are MUCH more trendy.~Kazami Ami
5,For the love of rustic,"This book is a real winner for those who love rustic, casual but sophisticated rooms. There is a lot of Southwestern decor here but you can apply a lot of what Mary Emmerling is showing without going that far. I think of it as introducing some Native American culture into my spaces and that is so earthy, colorful and rich. Her textiles and textures are very inspiring. This is my favorite decorating book! Just about every page is a hit with me."
1,Inadequate,This video shows the author using a Makiwara but has no explanations of any kind. You can get some ideas on different methods of striking a Makiwara but it really needs some explanations and instructions on proper Makiwara use. Hopefully there are better videos out there on this subject.
3,Damning with faint praise,"Uncle Hugo's staff recommendations shelf failed me for the first time ever. This title was just OK, and I was primed for it to be so much better. The main character is a biologist, and so the descriptions of all things organic were extremely well done. But the plot is terribly uneven in its timing--slogging along until I almost put the book down out of despair that anything would every happen again and then surging ahead to give me false hope again. And the love story line could have used some serious fleshing out. <grin> I did like the plot twist at the end. If you can put up with the very delayed gratification, it may be worth readng. How's that for damning with faint praise?"
3,"Good, but not amazing","Survival is about a salmon researcher thrown into the middle of an intergalatic mystery that could lead to the end of our species. This book has some ups and some downs, but in the end, fell short of anything more than 3 stars. The plusses were great character development and (for the most part) an intriguing plot. The primary downside was writing that was in many places confusing due to an inability to attend to detail. Another downside was the sheer number of events that simply defied logic and were given no explanation as to why they happened. I personally think this book was undercooked, perhaps 100 or so pages short of a 4 star effort."
2,Not her best- wait for the paperback,The book reads as though about a hundred pages was edited out to make it more marketable and a lot of connections were lost. There was nothing in Mac's background to make her the critical central character. There was nothing to make me believe she would be capable of being the only human interface to a very alien species. The relationships between Mac and just about every one else were unconvincing. The biological principles driving the conclusion were illogical unless that species was aiming towards mass extinction. I have read every one of Ms. Czerneda's books and this one does not measure up.
1,Marine Biologists are not interesting people,I read 150 pages into this book and had to put it down. The writing is mediocre and the story progresses slower than a snail. The characters are unbelieveable (and I'm not talking about the aliens). Julie E. Czerneda is not a good writer. Apparently she is an ex-biologist....maybe she should have stayed in that field... Don't waste your time with this book. This is probably the worst one I've ever read.
2,As Exciting as Looking at a Dead Plant Cell in a Microscope,"I have a hard time trying to decide if I liked this novel. I liked the use of biology in the novel. It gave the story that extra sense of ""realism"". However, I just couldn't develop a liking to Mac. I was never able to feel that I cared for this character. She was just simply boring to me. I think a lot had to do with many sections in the story in which the author has Mac sitting around simply doing nothing and it slowed the pace of the story almost to a screeching halt. Also, the other human characters were simply just there. The relationships and friendships that the author tried to convey just wasn't there. I think the problem with the story was that it gave us too much detail about too many trivial things. I was surprised that I didn't read 2 or 3 pages about Mac using the toilet and worrying about Em as she slowly starts to pull out the toilet paper. I don't know. Maybe it was just me, but I was simply bored."
2,Yikes... more of the same,"The title itself makes me wonder. Aren't Mormon ""elders"" the missionaries that are usually 19-21 years of age that preach the principles of the gospel to those who will listen? The author attempts to ""prove"" that Mormons are not Christians by having a theological discussion with a kid. Anyways, if anyone were to simply look up the definition of Christian, they would see that the entire premise is false. Maybe the title should read ""Mormons don't believe in the same doctrines that I believe in and therefore are all going to hell."" That is an interesting opinion, based on some very interesting interpretations of the Bible, but the author doesn't ""prove"" anything.The best way to understand this item is to read this article first:http://farms.byu.edu/display.php?table=review&id;=310&mp;=TThen make your conclusions."
2,Annoying at best...,"I had to buy this book for class and I tried to give it a shot and read it, but it was really annoying. A lot of what we needed to find a job, was discussed in my portfolio class and was common sense.The book did go over things to do, and if you could get past all the personal mumbo jumbo blah blah that the author felt he had to assault you with, it might be okay. I just couldn't get past all the preaching he kept doing. It was extremely annoying."
4,Best Advice I've gotten,"I have had some shitty career advice, but this book really put it in perspective for me, and even encouraged exploration, which most career-oriented people shy away from."
2,Too much excess blah blah blah,"I think maybe this author is a little too comfortable with how successful his book has been in the past, because this edition was so overstuffed with anecdotal and sometimes patronizingly excessive information that I had a hard time actually finding useful stuff. It's in there, but you really have to weed through a lot of fluff to find it. I much preferred the ""Cool Careers for Dummies"" book, which actually gives practical ways for you to look ""inward"" and figure out what you want to do with your life. Plus, they have realistic, straightforward information about careers that might interest you. Mr. Bolles may have a lot of experience and think that readers are hanging on his every word, but I did not buy the book to read it for pleasure, I just want to find a career, and some practical ways to get me there without all of the useless banter."
3,Wise advice in need of a treadmill,"The author has great career advice to give and where specific advice is found in this book, it's delivered very well.Unfortunately, to get the excellent advice and facts about the business of putting the effort, selling yourself, and landing a job, you have to drag yourself through numerous pages of soft existential text. I found no clear strategy to jump ahead without missing important ideas.Reading this book is like wandering around the once-in-a-lifetime garage sale of a retentive genius.For the sake of future readers I hope the author would take the time to put this text on a treadmill, as only he could do. I bet half the text could go without losing any of the awesome advice."
4,What Color is Your Parachute? 2007 Edition,"My professor recommended this book to our class to help us develop a dymanic resume. The book taught me how to evaluate my strengths, create a resume that is concise and to the point, and how to relax during an interview. It outlined questions to ask a prospective employer during the interview and taught me how to search the internet, finding salaries that are commensurate with specific strengths I have in regard to various job positions. The book, also, walked me through the negoiation process of the interview. I learned how to create an electronic portfolio resume. Excellent book. Enjoy."
3,ok,I used this book before going back to school since I was looking to get ideas career paths. It did an ok job of helping.
5,color your life with this book!l,This book was given as a gift and I decided to buy one for myself-it helps clear your head.
4,Mostly Common Sense,"Great book to use as a refresher, but I found it to be a compilation of stories and anecdotes that were mostly common sense."
4,Interesting look back at traction 30 years ago,Lucky to have found a copy of this look at streetcars at the hiatus between old systems replacing their PCC fleets with new cars & new systems being built.
3,A 4+ star book if not for its disturbing depictions of women,"There are so few books which approach men's emotions with honesty and compassion. Watson's Laura is a step in that direction. I just wish I could recommend it more.The problem is that there doesn't seem to be a healthy major female charater in the entire book. Both Laura and the mother are overly critical and negative while the girlfriend and wife are spineless wimps.Yes, we need more books about what men feel. But does it have to be at the cost of deprecating women? This is truly a well written book for the most part. I just don't understand why Watson couldn't have been more fair handed with the female characters."
4,Haunting,"I did judge this book by it's cover - it's haunting image drew me in. As a romantic from the fifties, ""Laura"" struck a chord with me.However, I did get impatient with Paul during his interludes with Laura. His indecisiveness, lack of communication, and nerdiness got tiring. I kept inventing dialogue for him at these times.Regardless, ""Laura"" still delivers the goods as represented by the cover."
1,melee,"I dont think this is a good cd, I would like it much better if I knew that the people in the band weren't stuck on their egos and that they treated others better and with more respect. Especially to the people who helped them get to where they are now, Where are we? left behind!!!!"
1,Brainwashing at its most obvious!,"Don't make the mistake of ordering this book thinking you are getting accurate history. What you get is a very blunt and obvious bludgeon to family values.This book is a classic example of a book directed, bought and paid for and written under the direction of the New World Order elite. It has a very clear agenda of destroying the traditional family starting with the husband and finishing with the entire family unit.Be sure to read the introduction and all the beginning information and it will become crystal clear that this is a book written with a very clear agenda of disinformation."
5,Very energetic music for a bargain price,"I bought this CD and enjoy every song. The traditional songs are so energetic. I think the music is a combination of Scruggs, Bela Fleck style and old time banjo music.What's unique about the music on this CD is even though it some tuba, drums and even electric guitars are also added to the mixed which gave a great sound even though the sound is still bluegrass overall. I know that drums, tubas and electric guitars don't belong in bluegrass music, but this CD is the exception rather than the rule."
2,Something's missing...,"It's kind of hard to tell exactly what's going on with the banjo on this CD because it's so poorly mixed you can barely hear it. And this is supposed to be a banjo CD. At times the most prominent sounds on this disk are the drums. And that brings me to my other point...there are no drums in bluegrass. Sorry, but that's the way it is. Every song on this CD is accompanied by drums. It's just not right. If you want to hear a clean, powerful version of Ruben (Reuben's Train) or Old Joe Clark just buy the Deliverance soundtrack (that's the CD that made me want to learn banjo)."
5,FANTASTIC IS THE WORD FOR DONNY OSMOND,"I have been around for 41yrs & I have yet to see an artist who can top Donny Osmond. He is the genuine article, he has so much talent & finesse, yet he is overlooked. Soldier Of Love & Sacred Emotion are the most moving songs I have heard in a long time. Sacred Emotion can touch your soul in such a way that you lose yourself in the lyrics. Soldier Of Love is a move to the groove song, watch your step. My Love Is A Fire has the beat babe & you can understand the words. The lyrics make since, I love his music and his talk show & Marie Osmond completes that picture. Donny you are Rock-N-Roll with Soul keep up the good work & get goin guy we need some new tunes. Real music with meaning and style this Fan is for you. ""Too-Tall"""
2,"Where are ""The Best""","This is a pitiful attempt to again bilk the consumer. His last 3 Billboard singles are here, but the rest is filler. If you truly want ""The Best"", then buy ""25 Hits Special Collection"". It contains 15 of his 16 Billboard hits, the only exception being ""My Love Is A Fire"" which isn't that great anyway."
5,Pristine,"Butterfly Man is a touching and complex movie about the despair and hope of a British backpacker who finds a deeper sense of purpose in the colorful and beautiful world he experiences in Thailand. The visuals of this movie will make you feel that you are in an island paradise yourself, as they're filled with prelapserian visions of purity and sweetness. The two main characters, Adam and Em, acted expertly by Stuart Laing and Napakpapha ""Mamee"" Nakprasitte, share a passionate bond, one that will make you believe in the redemptive and soulful power of love."
1,Skip It,"The only redeeming quality of this film is the fact that the gorgeous scenery of Thailand is shown in full grandeur. The viewer can really get a feel for the country. However, the storyline and characters are weak, trite, and boring. The film uses the all too common theme of Western man's infatuation for a young Thai woman but tries to convince the audience that it's true love. It is an unbelievable story with an even more ludicrous ending."
3,The things you knew you should know,"I just finished listening to this book on CD while driving back and forth to work, now I am getting ready to spend the money on the book... after listening to the CD the second time!While there are no straight forward solutions to issues or mechanics, it is clear the Joe Vitale belives in the power of the universe to bring us what we need. On the other hand, there is no encouragement to sit back on the couch watching cartoons and expect the world to fall into your lap either.Essentially what is contained within is an encouragement and a guide to ""see"" your goals clearly, no matter how high, and be aware enough to act on the opportunities that present themselves.Many other authors have contributed and I am looking forward to holding this book so that I can look more deeply into what they have to offer outside of Joes Vitales realm."
3,"Not as definitive as the title would suggest, but OK","This book was OK and full of advice, but I didn't find it as definitive as the title would suggest."
2,"If you read The Secret, don't buy this book...","It's a re-fried version of The Secret. Plain and simple. Even worse Joe Vitale uses this book to promote over and over again his other book ""The Attractor Factor"".It's easy to read because it's a compilation of small ""nuggets"" of wisdom. It even has the same people that appear in The Secret, like Jack Canfield and some other people I don't even remember. It's like they got together to make a bunch of books and videos and tapes that say the same message.Like I titled this review, don't waste your money or time if you already read The Secret."
4,Life's Missing Manual,"I recommend this book as an introduction to the rest of Joe Vitale's work. It is an anthology including personal experiences, and nuggets of philosophy. If you like this book, like me, you will tend to highlight passages and read them again. It is an easy, hard to put down kind of book. If you liked this book, I would recommend you to read on The Attractor Factor. Enjoy!"
2,LIFES MISSING INSTUCTION MABUAL,"GOOD, BUT NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE...NOTHING EYE OPENING, NOT A BOOK I WOULD GIVE TO A FRIEND TO READ"
1,Ok... Mostly philosophy.,This book was ok... A little redundant and difficult to get through. Lots of advice and ideas you've heard before... Everyone seems to think the title is misleading... I'd agree.
5,"When you Know the Instruction, you can Design your Life Roadmap","There are always ups and downs in life. Many of us are wondering why it is happening to our life. Is there an answer to this? Is there anyway to influence our future that in synchronize with the nature?I am amazed at how simple it is when Joe Vitale lay it down in this book ""Life's Missing Instruction Manual"".Yes, you can be happy now.Yes, there is a reason of what is happening to usYes, you can get help from the universe if you know howYes, when you know the instruction, you can adjust your life to what you expect.Grab this book.You do not want to live with no instruction.It is always easier if you have instruction manual in handy.This is our Life, I am glad Joe has given me the instruction."
5,A Masterpiece and a Must-Read for EVERYONE!,"Joe Vitale did it again! With his captivating writing style, nuggets of wisdom, and from the heart advice, he's written something that is truly inspirational, educational, and enjoyable to read. Some pieces of the manual remind you what you already know and could use reminding about; other pieces can shift the entire way you think and live if you take them in and experience them. The only problem with this book? It's impossible to put down and I'm sleepy after staying up much too late reading it!"
5,Great Book for Newly-weds and Young Adults,"Unfortunately, as we get older and generally too late to use the information, sooner or later each of us determines that there are many things that we wish we had known much earlier in life. Young adults generally like to learn things for themselves rather to listen to the wise sage who has been there done that. This book provides the information all of us should known but for whatever reason, we didn't. This is a great book to give to young adults. It is full of information on a wide range of subjects useful as they encounter the rough patches in life, and they will!"
4,A must for personal development!,There are chapters in this book that spoke specifically to issues I have dealt with for years and immediately set me free! I'm sure I will give it the 5th star once I finish!
4,nice tips on navigating through life,"I really liked this book. It has several short ""essays"" with valuable information on various aspects of life and how to deal with him. If you liked Joe Vitale in the Secret, you'll enjoy what he has to say here, since there is a lot of mindset/attitude related material.Somebody mentioned about this book being 90% informercial. While I don't entirely disagree with that, don't let those comments keep you away.Several of the essays in this book are by people other than Joe Vitale. Some of them have contact information where you can get more information about what is being talked about. Infomercial? I think that's a little strong, but I'm sure there are parts within this book designed to get you to ask for more information and possibly buy other books.That is the only reason I am voting this as 4-stars rather than 5. While I like getting information from other people, I purchased wanting information from Joe Vitale."
5,"Wonderful, pragmatic and inspirational book for everyone","This might be Joe Vitale's finest work today. With the help of a number of powerhouse contributors, Vitale has put together a truly useful instruction manual for life.The theme's of the book cover all aspects of life... including success and wealth.It's not just a feel good book. It has pragmatic, real life bits of wisdom that all can ponder and absorb.I truly love this book. You might want to pick up a few copies for people you love. It IS one of ""those kinds"" of books.Kevin HoganAuthor of The Psychology of PersuasionandThe Science of Influence"
2,10% Gold and 90% Infomercials,"If you can skip past the hundreds of advertisements for the self-help products being peddled by Joe's friends and colleagues, there is actually some very useful stuff in here. But the presentation of the material is very disjointed. This is really just a collection of infomercials. Not bad but there are many better books out there that are actually written by one person and flow coherently."
1,Garbage,"C.Joss said in a review: ""This book is a disjointed collection of contributions from Joe's friends and colleagues, padded with Joe's own contributions. It's not the manual that it purports to be. There's is no common thread running through the book, no process to be implemented.""The same can be said of every ""book"" ever written by ""Dr."" Joe Vitale. They are all the same. No one cranks out more assembly line ""books"" than Joe, but then when your friends contribute 80% of the content every time, it's easy to see why Joe is so productive.There are plenty of authors who write their own books and actually take enough pride in their work to try to come up with something original. Go read them instead."
3,"Quite dull, and quite over-rated","Joe Vitale is an obvious sales-person. That he sells in the cathegory of ""Making other people feel good"" does not take away from that fact. He is a salesman. I feel I wasted my time and money on this trite, regurgiated collection of articles and wise-guy essays."
2,Life's Missing Instruction Book,"Book is mostly written by others, not Dr. Joe Vitale. While many of the little stories are good, I find it a disappointing book on the whole."
1,All I needed (sigh...),"A guide to maximum selfishness, and how seeing ghosts can land you a custom BMW."
4,Clásico que no hay que dejar de leer,"Clásico libro de Paulo Coelho. No es mi favorito pero si están con ganas de leer algo espiritual es una buena opción y mejor si después leen El Guerrero de la Luz. Estos dos libros son importantes para entender mejor los siguientes libros de Coelho, pues aquí empieza hablar sobre la Tradición etc, aunque no es necesario si no los quieren leer."
3,Nice Story,"I liked the story, no doubt Paulo added his appealing style. It was nice in general.Rromantic, religious and epic to some extent."
2,Shrunken story,"Mark's aunt works in the Asian jungle. One day a woman appears at their door, and says she's a friend of his aunt. She has come to bring him to his aunt.When Mark arrives, his aunt has gone missing and he's told that he has jungle magic and must use it to find her. But he has no powers? And what's going on there, anyway.This story didn't captivate me one bit. The plot was idiotic. Not what the Goosebumps is about."
5,GOT TO READ IT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I like ""How I got my Shrunken Head"" because it was full of adventure. The boy in this story's name is Mark. He has a special power... Sorry, I just can't tell you any more!!!!!"
5,Shrunken heads rule!,"This is one of my favorite goosebumps. it was one of the first ones ive read. mark gets a gift from his Aunt Benna in Baladora, a tropical island. it's a green, wrinkly, shrunken head! Mark finds out that the shrunken head gives him a strange power when he says the word Kah-lee-ah. Mark is brought over to Baladora because his aunt is missing, but actually he is being used to reveal the secrets on how to work the head to some evil scientists. Will Mark escape and find his aunt? You have to read the book!"
4,Heads up!,"TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE!What has two eyes, a mouth, and wrinkly green skin? Mark's shrunken head. It's a present from his Aunt Benna. A gift from the jungle island of Baladora.Mark can't wait to show the kids at school his shrunken head. It's so ugly. So gross. So awesome.But late one night the head starts to glow. Because it's no ordinary head. It gives Mark a strange power. A magical power. A dangerous power...."
2,decent but not good,"If you're really into NCAA, and Madden and are used to quality football games like that, then stay away from this game. Also if you have a good knowledge of those games and like the challenging nature of those games, don't get this game. If you are a child or have a child, this game would be fun for them to learn a little bit about football. It is a good game to rent and mess around with, but that's about it. If you are a big football fan and are very tempted to purchase this game, just keep playing on your dynasty mode."
3,Arena Football from EA Sports,"It is a great game but, It can lock up on you. I am in the process of getting it exchanged for one that does not lock up."
3,An ok R&B CD,"This CD is ok I guess if you like most of the artists presented on this R&B collection of hits. Monica, Brandy, Toni Braxton and Chante Moore are practically the only good singers with decent R&B songs on here. The rest is basically garbage! No offense, but the rest of the tracks are pretty weak and boring. I wouldn't recommend getting this unless you like every single artist presented on this collection. So what you have here is basically 4 or 5 decent popular R&B songs and a handful of boring (make you sick-to-your-stomach, bore-you-to-death) type songs. If that's the kind of music you like, go ahead and grab it today!"
4,The Best of the Best R&B singers of the new millineum,"I like the majority of the artists from their previous recordings. You can tell the truly talented and professional artists from the one hit wonders or the one trying to make the comebacks. My favorite artists at the moment are Tyrese, R-Kelly, Beyonce, Luther(always), The Isley Bros & Monica. Some of Brandy's last hits also. I'm not feeling Ashanti. The girl is very pretty but she can't sing. I think they are trying to make her another Aaliyah. Aaliyah is one of a kind! She is so irreplaceble, mulitalented in everything she did(singing, dancing, acting, and with her incredible natural beauty she would've conqured modeling and fashion easily. So Ashanti don't the Aaliyah awesome talent!! Oh and Usher is very good on cd and in concert!"
3,A little disappointing,"Susan Howatch is one of my favorite authors. Her all time greats, my favorties, are ""Cashelmara"" and ""Penmarric"". I read all of the Church of England series, too, and this book follows one of their characters, Nick Darrow. The books with him as the central figure are not my favorites. He is not a really likeable character as was his father. Once I was into the book I had to finish it but at the end I did not feel the redemption of the character as I usually feel with her novels. It left me ""flat"". After ""Mystical Paths"", probably my least favorite. I am reading ""Wheel of Fortune"" now and it promises to be a long and good read. Please note that this novel is her ""The Wonder Worker"" under the British title, ""Question of Integrity"", and I had bought both, which was a waste of money."
4,A Question of Integrity,A book that irritates sometimes but one I had to keep reading as I became more and more intrigued and hooked!
2,Will not be first choice when picking belt.,"I love the look of the belt; however, the folded over metal spikes that the embellishments are held on with are very thin, sharp and flimsy and are easily lifted when threading the belt through the loops and while wearing. You can bend the sharp triangle shaped backs back down on the reverse side easily, but they lift even easier and I keep stabbing my back and sides when wearing it. I can't practically wear this belt because of the discomfort of the sharp pieces poking and I can't see any fix for it."
1,The True and the Questions Journal,"I had not read this author and was so disappointed in this book I have returned it to Amazon, even though I will be out the shipping costs! It is written as though talking to and written by a 6 year old. I am insulted that she would even think an adult would read this book. I recommend you do not waste your money. If you can't make an art journal, visit the many wonderful on-line websites that will teach you how for free, and offer guidance by other on-line journalers and artists. This book is a total waste of money."
3,good but not great,"This book is really just a journal with pages designed with Sabrina's artwork and suggested topics for you to journal about. I really love Sabrina's art but would not use this particular journal as a journal. Part of the fun of art journaling is making your own pages, not just writing over pages made by someone else."
2,okayy..,"It wasn't as great as I thought it would be. I love Sabrina's work a lot, but I could have done better borrowing the book at the library or from a friend or something as opposed to buying it. The work shown in the book isn't very different or interesting. Nothing that actually stood out to inspire me. Although, she did leave blank spaces for the reader to fill out on their own, I've seen better books on this genre."
5,Great thought provoker,"This journal is fabulous. I am a daily journaler and I use this when I cannot think of a topic. The author has the beginning topics in it and then I can continue on the same path or I can go off on my own tangent. It makes me think about things I wouldn't normally think about and I like that. This is heavy duty paper, kind of like cardboard. Definitely worth a buy. I get tons of compliments on this. I have taken it with me on trips and home for the holidays."
1,Insulting,"This book wasn't good at all. I didn't like it because it degraded homosexual men and turned them into some fangirl's fantasy. It trivialized gay men and portrayed them as one dimensional, and they behaved unrealistically.Plus, there were spelling mistakes! And grammatical errors, too. That happens sometimes, but should never happen in a published book."
1,It can't get much worse!!,"An obvious vanity publication that lacks imagination, cohesiveness and any shred of talent. Save your time, effort, and most of all, your money. The first in a series? I can not believe that there are two more books of this dribble existing in the small, narrow mind of this so-called author. But vanity publishers will accept just about anything, I guess."
5,Beautiful and relaxing,"a CD that can be played in the background and thoroughly enjoyed without knowing it.Something different for a change form Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin and Haydn."
2,Orthodoxies is Tedious,"I had to read this book for a seminary course. If you're not an academic, don't even try reading it. It is laborious. I am already well-versed in Separatist and Puritan history and still found it tedious. Besides this,the author's thesis is on thin ice because only one orthodoxy emerges from Knight's writing except for hair splitting and subtle differences in doctrine."
3,Business Start-up Info,"I found this book to be more of a generalized ""start a business"" book than a book on using mindpower. I feel the title is misleading."
4,Yum!,"Chocolate Kisses was a very sweet and yummy book of short stories. My personal favorite was ""Sweet Creations"" If you're a fan of stories that end happily ever after, this is a book for you."
3,To improve your feeling of Jazz music.,"Bukra is not the best CD of Rabih Abou-Khalil on my mind, but it already shows us a perfect example of research in Music creation. Rabih Abou-Khalil is picking the best of his music culture and what he has learned (with talent) about Jazz music. BUT he does not mix them, he improves both by a magic wedding. In my opinion, the musics in this CD are a little bit too slow. As always in his CD, he invites talented players and they creates tonal music, that touch your emotion. LISTEN TO IT AS A BEGINNING IN YOUR PASSION FOR Rabih Abou-Khalil and let's enter in a New Jazz World by listening to other R. AK. cd.FM"
5,Great Book for teens!,"My mom gave me Acne For Dummies to read because I'm very frustrated about my acne and for the first time I read something that I could UNDERSTAND and was also very helpful. I also enjoyed some of the unusual sidebars!! I recommend this book for all teens who have been confronted with the confounding problems of acne-- this book is clear, concise and very useful. I will refer back to it from time to time to remind myself of the options available to me. I think all pediatricians should be recommending it as well as school nurses and stuff. Thanks Dr. Goodheart for writing this book!!"
5,Truly Hearfelt,"One of my favorite Spider-Man stories, let alone Jeph Loeb stories. It truly is a heart-felt journey, and I was glad I took it."
3,Blue is right...,"Being a fan of the Loeb/Sale team (I was swtiched on after Long Halloween), I was naturally excited to find out they were doing their own take on Spidey. After all, they had done a great job with Superman and Batman, so the Marvel icon should be a great read too right? Well...The artwork was amazing, as usual, Tim Sale adds his own flavor in creating a very 60's pop art feel to Spidey Blue. Sale has always delivered top-notch American artistry to his comics. Loeb's exposition is smartly written, but then the book lacks that universal appeal that would grab readers almost immediately. Inasmuch as the aim is to bring out Pete's blues over Gwen's death, Loeb fails to focus on the actual death for any first-time reader to understand what happened. It would have been interesting to see how Jeph Loeb would approach this milestone moment of Marvel Comics. In the end, it made me feel pretty blue..."
3,"Great art, interesting story, little Gwen","Being a casual Spiderman fan, I missed pretty much all of the Gwen Stacy storyline and was hoping to see something new in this book. But although I enjoyed the art and storyline, I was disappointed that it only lightly touched upon Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy's relationship. Even in this book, which purports to be dedicated to Gwen, MJ has a much meatier and interesting role (she comes off as a bit shallow, but definitely more of a go-getter than Gwen).I'm hoping other reviewers might be able to recommend better sources for more on Gwen/Peter."
3,Blue? Bland!,"Blue is a well drawn work. Tim Sale's art does not disappoint nor do Steve Buccaletto's colors.Where Blue stumbles is the horrible, trite ""humor"" spouted by Spidey during his fisticuffs.Jeph Loeb is a talented writer and should have made Spiderman's banter humorous not cliched and wretched. It's a very irritating distractor.Ultimately, Blue fails to deliver anything new or original to Spiderman's early days. It's a decent work but nothing special."
4,Great Songs and Cool Concept from Penelope,"Folk-rock chanteuse Penelope Houston's new one is a bit like a soundtrack for a romantic 60s French movie. Using chimy guitars, warm garagy fuzz organ, and stripped down percussion, Penelope paints a picture that is appealing to power poppers and garage aficianados, as well as indie pop fans. Great songs as well as evocative atmosphere make this one a must-have!"
4,Another Side of Penelope Houston,"This disc represents a slightly changed direction for Penelope Houston, adding a somewhat harder edge to the ""neo-folk"" of her '80s & '90s recordings. A great collection of songs, and her voice is in fine form. She also saves the best for last; her cover of John Cale's ""Buffalo Ballet"" is simply exquisite. It's a fine version that compliments the original, but is a unique and moving expression all its own."
3,"His non-military books are better, this one a bit slow","I'm a recent convert to Deuterman's work and have thoroughly enjoyed his non-military novels like Firefly and Cat Dancers. His military based novels (this one is the Naval Academy) just go into too much detail that doesn't add to the story, just lets us know that he served proudly in the armed services (for which I say thanks). He is a terrific suspense writer with well thought out plot lines, excellent character development and fast pacing. Just start with one of his more recent works if you are new to his writing and you'll enjoy them immensely."
3,A good thriller is buried within all that fluff,"First of all - Darkside, even more than Deutermann's other books, requires a good understanding of Naval and military jargon. Unless you already know what a ""reefer"" is (no it's not marijuana) and you know what an OOD is, and many other slang terms, you may get lost in this book and give up on it.And that's unfortunate, because it IS a good book, although it's about twice as long as it really needs to be. The theme is unique and plausible, and the action, once it FINALLY gets moving, is pretty intense.If you can stick with it, you'll be pleased with this Deutermann book. It just seems like the author said to himself ""Well, Tom Clancy can write ridiculously long novels, why can't I""?"
2,Badly flawed,"The details about the Academy and Annapolis are interesting. The military side is OK.The big issue is using ""Goths"" as uber-evil super criminals. While a few might be somewhere maybe, most Goths are simply kids who like a certain style of music and fashion. The motivation of the two at the Academy make no sense at all. The main criminal in this mystery is so superior in ability and intelligence to everyone else that one wonders why he would take up a career of mainly stupid pranks when he could be the next Sect. of the Navy or Bill Gates."
3,"Great story, lousy ending","This story started off well. It was interesting and captivating most of the way through but got very slow in parts. The author's description of sexual things seemed a little bit like middle school mentality and made those sections akward. I enjoyed the book all the way until the ending started unfolding. All this build up, all this development and then a big let down. I would recommend reading the whole thing then going back just a bit and imagining your own ending."
3,Plodding Intrigue,"A story line with good potential is unfortunately lost in the midst of tedious conversations, undevloped characters and tangential subplots. I have not read any of Deutermann's previous novels but will give them a try ~ am wondering if he is not at the point where he should rest on his laurels or develop another angle."
5,Grabs you by the hairs on your neck and doesn't let go,"Pete Deutermann is one of the few authors that I'll buy in hardback without even reading the dust jacket first - he's that good. His latest, Darkside, is one of his most gripping to date. I don't want to give away any of the story line so let's just say that one of the plot developments was wholly unexpected. It's a nice change to read a military who-done-it by someone who actually served in uniform and knows the environment, the slang, etc., although Deutermann has made his mark in writing great mysteries in non-military settings as well."
3,The Persecutor,"I read this book based on an excerpt I'd read from another source. It was a big disappointment to say the least. I'd expected it would have included a more extensive description of Kourdakov's life as a Christian. Instead it dealt largely with his early life and his persecution of Russian Christians as an employee of the KGB. The brief part of the book that talked about his Christian activities was quite shallow and something of an anti-climax. The very brief discussion of his murder at the end of the book was decidedly inadequate. It seemed to have been added as an, ""Oh by the way..."" conclusion to an otherwise very unsatisfactory and poorly written book. Mediocre writing, questionable documentation, and somewhat self-serving. I definitely do not recommend it."
2,The book is probably a fiction,"I have read the book and it was interesting, though often it sounded exaggerated and I was a bit suspicious about it. After googling a little about the book, I have found a movie called ""Forgive me, Sergei"" from two people, who attempted to film a documentary on Kourdakov's life, but during their investigation about the part of the story in Russia, they have found, that the book is probably a fiction. And because this book poses as a true story, I can not give it higher rating.[...]"
5,"Rough Reading, Eye-Opening, Full Of Sorrow And Courage","Every time I read this book, I cry. I don't read it often because it shakes me up too badly. It makes you count your blessings. If you're feeling sorry for yourself over most any Western-level problem, Sergei's story is effective therapy! If you want a realistic view of life under communism, here it is. A must-read for those ""enemies of the State"" knows as ""believers""."
5,Glimpse into Soviet Culture,"I found this book in 1986 shortly after the Lord Jesus saved me while a russian-language student at the University of Arizona. God used this book to provoke my heart into surrendering to Christ's calling upon my life as a fulltime church-planting missionary in the former Soviet Union.Now that I've been working here 5 years by His grace, I see first-hand what Sergei spoke of.Don't discount this book as mere religious propoganda - this is the unveiled truth, revealing what life is like under atheistic communism.ukrainebaptist@yahoo.com"
2,Really liked it...if it would have worked more than 4 months,I bought this for someone as a gift for Christmas. It worked great until the end of March. Now it is not distributing the sound in both speakers of his car. This is frustrating when you cannot return after 30 days AND it was a gift. How many things actually break within the first 30 days? This should have to be made good with a replacement.
5,Highly recommended reading.,Dr. Lefavi has laid the stepping stones through logic and reasoning our need for spirituality. My scepticism toward high profile religous leaders allowed me to slide into spiritual denial. Although this is not a book about salvation it does help one come to grips about their relationship with God.
5,Best bio WWE ever created.,"I love this DVD, its everything an ECW fan wanted to have in a DVD. They did the promotion right. They were fair and balanced like Fox News. The bonus matches are ok but the bio is worth the price you pay. Unfortuneatly people still try to drum up ECW (see WWE-TNA) and unrest the greatness that was simply good booking and hard workers. I wish people would realized these guys are almsot middle aged now and their continued attemtps to spark ECW actually tarnish its legacy.BUY THIS NOW."
2,Another horrible wwe dvd,"All of these matches save for 1 or 2 have been released already.They can be found on the pioneer releases like extreme evolution , path of destruction, etc. They do this with many of their dvds, they just reuse some of the same matches over and over again. For Example; the wwe mick foley release and the pioneer cactus jack dvd. They're almost exactly the same.Some matches like the hell in a cell matches(Mankind vs Undertaker and hbk vs undertaker) have also been used in multiple wwe dvds. ECW had so many more unbeleivable and amazing matches during it's short run. HEY HOW ABOUT SOME MORE TAZ MATCHES AND RVD MATCHES WWE! Don't Bother with this because wwe will not do ecw any justice with this dvd."
5,possibly the best wrestling documentary,"I bought the ""rise and fall of ecw"" yesterday from best buy and got a free RVD action figure. Anyway, the main documentary itself is truly the most complete documentary you will ever find. 3 hours of Paul Heyman and his boys spilling their guts on ECW. You can tell they put alot of heart into ECW and it shows on this DVD. I have yet to watch the second disc with the matches, but the documentary alone is worth the money. A must buy far any old school or new school wrestling fan!!"
5,Sweet,This is one of the better dvds that the WWE has made. 2 discs with the first containing a great.documentary and the 2nd loaded with matches and a few extra interviews.
3,"Hey Vince, What about Shane Douglas?","I for one would have gave this video five stars if it had shown the proper respect to Shane ""the Francise"" Douglas! The ""Francise"" carried ECW on his back during the glory years. He rated more than 15 minutes! I know that Shane Douglas had heat with Vince McMahon. And I know that Paul Heyman owed Shane a large some of money. And I know that the WWE only puts out its version of wrestling history. But come on! Those of us that were ECW fans know that Shane Douglas had a huge impact on ECW and erasing his contributions only hurts the DVD and insults the ECW fan! This DVD should have been the ultimate ECW history DVD tribute!"
5,AWESOME DVD,I just got this in the mail earlier today. There are no words to describe this DVD. I didn't know alot about ECW before viewing this DVD. A must have for any Wrestling fan.
3,I'm a huge Morrell fan but this one was just paint by numbers,"No one writes books about a little guy vs. a vast conspiracy better than David Morrell. Morrell is one of the few authors that I will snatch up when I come across a new (or ""new to me"") title.""TheCovenant of the Flame"" tries to go for that ""on the run"" feel that Morrell usually establishes, but it just comes off as more of a ""paint by the numbers"" effort. ""The DaVinci Code"" covers similar material but the ""The Covenant of the Flame"" is the more plausible and older of the two. That being said, ""Covenant"" still just doesn't have ""it.""This is not a bad book per se and I certainly would encourage readers to read other Morrell books such asExtreme DenialandDesperate Measuresto get a feel for what this author is truly capable of."
4,Interesting and thoughtful,"This a very well paced book with interesting insight on cosmic religion and politics. I was a little disappointed as the fiction went a little overboard in the first couple of chapters where the author highlighted the good of Mithraism with antipathy. It has its own inspirations, from the political angle the immediate thought for me at the least was that of the Manchurian Candidate. The semi-fictional comparison between Mithraism and Christianity is fantastic. It did make me think a lot. I wish Mr. Morrell had ended the book with a positive perspective to both beliefs. I am not qualified to add anything to the book but if were to add one thing I would have said the figures of Jesus and Mithras are to some extent both expressions of a single deep longing in the human spirit for a sense of contact with the ultimate mystery. In the end it is a good book to read and say ""wow"" several times."
3,"Skin-deep research, disappointingly adolescent dialogue.","Could have been well done, the topics were interesting but the author did little in-depth research that would have made the book more authentic. The dialogue was not believable, real people do NOT say these things to each other. Background is given in the middle of the action to justify the heroine's behavior. This interupts the flow of the action and distracts the reader"
4,Wow! Loved the action and religious/historical insights,"I loved all the religious good vs. evil information - I'm surprised in today's Da Vinci Code media world, people haven't gone back to this book, cause Mr. Morrell was talking about this stuff way before Dan Brown. Loved how he wrote the Inquisition was still happening - All very interesting stuff...I will say that some of the dialogue was wooden, fake sounding and unrealistic. But it was few and far in between. The interesting characters - gray eyes in particular - and the non stop action more than made up for it. All in all, a great religious/political/environmental thriller that never let up! Mr. Morrell is one of my favorites and he didn't disappoint with this one."
1,Stinker,"Totally ridiculous plot, dialogue, and actions by everyone involved. A beautiful woman manages to shoot better than everyone else and kill about a dozen men trying to shoot her, while her attackers manage to kill supposed professionals around her. If that appeals to you, then by all means, get this book. I would be embarrassed to have my name as author of this novel."
2,The Introduction is the best part.,"I read this book while preparing a country report on Afghanistan as an undergrad. Interesting yet highly biased account of Afghan-Soviet relations during the early years of the PDPA. The author's opinions were so skewed that I found this book difficult to read at times, and even more difficult to use as a reliable source for examining Afghan Communism.The best part of the book is the introduction, in which the author summarizes and nicely frames Afghan history under the Durrani tribe."
2,A Critique of the Title,"Although the writer has squeezed much information and research into this book, it can hardly be labeled as possessive of a neutral character when analyzing the socio-political and economic situations prevalent in the country. This book certainly is not sufficient and certainly not recommended for developing an assessment of Afghan history or socio-political structure and strata."
5,Magic as Harry!,"My kids loved this book, I highly recommed it. The lack of words actually stoked my kids imaginations - we spend a great deal of time imaginging what each scene may have been and/or contained. This is a high quality pop-up, I highly recommend it."
5,Great for ages 11 to well over 60.,"Rowling herself said in interviews that the books were intended for readers Harry's age (i.e. Philosiphers Stone <original British title> Ages 11 & up, Goblet of Fire, ages 14 & up)One of the best things about Rowling is that even with a boy as the main chara, girls & boys men & women alike read it equally. If found the humer in every chapter, humor that while not sexual at all, was still too hard for children to catch.Dont get along with your siblings? Read Harry Potter & you'll have common ground. Bored to death on those long car trips? Make sure everyone in your families read it for some indepth conversation.Rowling is so smart & crafty, the way she actually published Quidditch Through the Ages & wrote it as if it were a real sport that had ben going on for ages."
3,Maybe I'm silly...,"...but does it strike anyone else as weird that in all three incarnations of CSI, the team lead is a while male? I mean, aren't there any black guys who make manager? How about girls? Asians? Let's really go out on a limb here... hispanics? Come on! You've got diversity all covered with supporting cast, but for pete's sake, it would be really, really nice if just once the lead scientist / detective was, like, as diverse as scientists and detectives are in real life.Ok, rant over. Sorry. Just a little peeved."
4,"Good show, sooo much better than CSI: Miami","I don't get a chance to watch CSI:NY when it's on TV during the week, but since I love the original CSI so much I thought I'd give it a shot and watch the DVD set. It's really well done with good story lines and well developed characters. I could've done without the first episode (the one after the crossover show with CSI:Miami) only because it seemed to try too hard to be dark and disturbing. As the season progressed, though, the stories got better and they lightened up on making NY so depressing. The original CSI is still the best, but this franchise is a really good addition. If they add another show (and hopefully get rid of CSI:Miami) maybe they could go with somewhere unexpected. NY was an obvious choice. It's a big country, how about picking a city that's not featured in every other show on TV? But I digress, this DVD set is very entertaining and worth owning."
4,"Yummy cast, grittier look & feel compared to the other CSI versions","I watched the earlier years of both CSI & CSI: Miami but hadn't gotten around to watching CSI: New York yet. I find that I like how visually different this is to the other franchises. The grittier look and darker colors lends itself well to the ""feel"" of New York. Loved the first season story lines, I'll have to get the following seasons to see more."
5,CSI NEW YORK,The most interesting series I have watched in some time.I was so impressed I ordered a copy for a friend.
4,Not as good as Las vegas and Monotonous but still worth watching,"I've been waiting for this DVD for a very long time since we don't get CSI: New York in (Dubai Only Las Vegas & Miami). I think that I build up my hopes a lot and I was expecting it to be better than or at least as good as Csi: Las Vegas but it was not.I feel it is monotonous because every single episode starts with suspense then it concentrates on the wrong person. The last six minutes the Einstein's discover everything.I don't know may be it is me who is used to Grissom, Catherine, Warrick and the others.I rate them as follows Las Vegas, New York then Miami.Having said that, I'll still wait for season 2."
3,Almost as good,but not as good as Las Vegas or Miami. I just couldn't like the characters until I had seen most of the series!
3,How many CSI could we take more?,"Okay I admit that their visual effects are supreb.So many breath taking momoments.But the story is not that creative enough as in the original CSI or CSI Miami.And how many ""blow fish-FUGU-"" episode can you take?...Most of all how come in this seriese they avoid Asians?They need to have at least one Asian in the cast...Hey after all it takes place in New york."
3,Less appealing than previous CSIs,"The quality and interest appear to be as good as the first 2 series, but I find the story lines dark and depressing. Just depends on how you ""see it""."
3,Quite Good,"Love Letters in Sand Again. If Pat Boone had never sung this song, he might not have had so many successful albums. Some more tracks would have been welcome, but this is a good collection ... and for the price, quite reasonable."
1,Does NOT fit '97 Dodge Ram 1500,"This item does NOT fit a 1997 dodge Ram 1500 power side mirror. It was way to big!! I am rating this one star only because I have to, otherwise it would be negative!"
3,A good interpretation,This is a nice issue for these flute and guitar works. The only caveat is the sound level on the guitar part which is not high enough for my personal taste.
3,Sexy,"Stunning piece of jewelry, there's a lot of detail for such a small piece. The only issue is that it tends to pinch a bit when the charm moves around, and will grab hold of jeans when you stand up after sitting for a while. Still worth it, though, because it looks so great and is really high quality."
5,Enchanting Music,"This music has depth and beauty that I rarely get to experience, The musical ideas develop throughout each of the pieces as well as the album as a whole. The songs seems to spring from a well of energy and have an almost magical quality that keeps you relaxed, yet engaged, The pieces are melodic and rhythmic enough that you don't drift off into a mindless trance. This is excellent music to work to, the music keeps you energized and focused on your work. It also great to listen to if you want to sit down and enjoy an album from start to finish."
2,Not such a great recording--mostly,"When I listened to the song samples here, I was amazed. They sounded mysterious and deep. I also heard part of one track on the radio, so I thought I couldn't go wrong with this CD. I wasn't really right. It's a bit New-Agey for my taste, though I guess I should have expected that. Many of the tracks are repetitious. Also, the album seems to be too middle-of-the-road. Most of it is too much like ""regular music"" to be really dreamlike or mysterious, but not enough like it to be worth listening to in any other way. There are a few REALLY GOOD moments on the CD, but you might want to buy it used, if at all."
5,There is no substitute for an escape into a faraway dream.,"Sleeping is the least you want, the edge of the world is the nearest you go. Sometimes, it feels like flying away, close your eyes and you're saved. Nobody knows your heart, all you desire is to be far. Infinitely distant from your places, immensely abstract from unfriendly faces. Through the abyss you go, to calm down your emotions storm. Smoothly soar beyond the boundries of the space, find yourself comfortable in that lonely place."
3,Helpful but not complete,"This book is very helpful for any economist, especially for students. It includes many formulas that are common in economics. I used the book a lot during my first-year phd course and it was very helpful because it is pretty compact. However, be careful as there are some minor errors in the book. Second, I cannot recommend it if you are interested mainly in econometric theory. You will find the basic distributions and a couple of other formulas, however there are still too few formulas about GMM or Filters etc. All in all I would recommend you the book."
4,handy little book,"I got this little book when I was in college studying economics and kept it throughout grad school in econ. It's been surprisingly useful, mostly because it contains formulas and no extraneous text. A pocket version would be even better."
5,A great reference,This book is a great reference for economics graduate students. A definite must buy.
3,Misleading Title,"This book is really about cold-molded boatbuilding. There is little useful information about strip-planked methods. He pays cursory attention to it in some chapters, and always at the end, as an afterthought. I am still looking for a good book on strip-planking.If you are interested in cold-molding or double-diagonal type applications, this book is technical and thorough. Useful as a reference. Buy it thinking of the title as ""Cold-Moulded Wood Boat Building, With an Afterword on Strip-Planked Methods"""
3,"Info good, Difficult read",The basic information on technique is helpful; however the author uses some odd language for the american reader. It takes some getting used to. For example he uses the word rebate instead of the wood working term rabbet and he says cramps for/or clamps for no apparent reason. He also barely hides his distain for strip planked hulls.
1,Buy if you like Teflon for dinner,"At first, I fell in love with this product. A baking pan that is thick and sturdy so it won't warp, and nice shiny silver Teflon! Had I written the review right after I got it, it would be an easy 5 stars. HOWEVER, this thing is quickly peeling, and my love has turned to hate. I feel betrayed. I took great pains to preserve the finish, using only wooden or plastic utensils and washing by hand. Yet it flakes. Last night I rubbed a stick of butter on it in preparation for the oven and the end of the stick ended up covered in silver pieces. Unfortunately, my search for the perfect baking pan continues..."
4,good product,"The pan is heavy and the coating seems to work well. The pan is a bit too heavy for my taste but maybe these pans are supposed to be heavy? My kids use it mostly and my duty is to wash, so I prefer things to be light."
1,Defective Coating,"When I first used this Cuisinart pan, I was quite pleased with the performance and bought three more pans with the same non-stick coating for other family members. A problem with the coating was discovered on about the third or fourth use. The coating substance inside the pans turned yellow and retained (with a darker brown coloration) the shape of the food that we had been cooking. We could not wash the pans clean. Worse than that, a roast we cooked had the drippings burn and stick to the pan so bad that, when I tried to clean the pan carefully with a silicone food scraper, the non-stick coating itself came loose and ruined the pan for all future use without first lining it with aluminum foil. I will never buy a pan from this brand again."
5,Best 13x9-inch pan!!,This cake pan is the best one I've ever owned. It's nonstick and nice and heavy. I love it!
4,the real easy bake,"love, love , love this pan. everything bakes like a dream. and the cleanup is a wish come true. no such thing as baked on with this pan. no elbow grease, no scrubbing. it cleans like you're just dusting it off."
1,Skip this book,"This is an awful book. The author makes huge leaps in the plot and the characters are uninteresting and shallow. You are told by the author that a particular character cares about someone or something, but their actions up until that point lead you to believe otherwise. Also, people simply do not speak the way characters in this book do. Using the eunuch Tulip as a narrator here was a bad idea. The author is constantly concocting ridiculous ways in which Tulip gets access into the private meetings of the Ottoman royalty."
3,Instead try...,"reading ""Sultana"" by Prince Michael (Michel) of Greece (1984). (""La Nuit du serail"" in French.)SO much better! Lush and Byzantine with more beautifully crafted sentences and deliciously described scenes. I found Sultana much more evocotive of the era, the palace and Nakshidil/Aimee's mind, not to mention, the historical accurancy is much sharper in Sultana. The book actually inspired my own unforgettable pilgrimage to the Harem at Topkapi in Instanbul.Very hard to find a copy, but keep after it, or if you read French, you might have an easier time finding ""La Nuit du Serail"". I originally found a copy of the latter at the main branch of the Brooklyn Public Library."
2,An Intriguing Setting But ...,"The book begins with a powerful scene: a Catholic priest summoned during the middle of the night to administer confession/last rites to the mother of the reigning sultan. Immediately, I was intrigued by this woman, how she came into such a situation. As the book wore on, however, I gained no real insight into her soul. I learned details about her past; I learned about the social and political boundaries of the harem, but I never cared about her or any of the main characters. The book never drew me into its world, which left ""Seraglio"" feeling too much like a simple romance novel."
2,2 stars for description,"Looking at the cover, Seraglio seemed to be the type of book I would carry with me and use to get lost in Turkey even while I'm surrounded by concrete. Sure, the descriptions of outfits are absorbing, but nothing else is. Aimee, or Nakshidil, the main character, seems to be viewed from far away, allowing the reader to glimpse only the roughest and most obvious of her emotions. I considered finishing it, but then thought: why bother? I really don't care how it's going to end.Final Verdict:Don't bother reading it."
1,This Book Rates Zero Stars,This book was awful! I'm amazed how an intriguing story like this can be told so poorly. With every page I groan out loud. Skip this book and read Sultana by Prince Michael of Greece instead.
3,Could Have Been Better,"The premise of this fictional account of an historical event is so intriguing that it seemed impossible for it to be a disappointing read. And yet it was. Though Wallach more than adequately describes ""what they wore"" and ""what they looked like"" she isn't able to tell the story very convincingly. Curiously she chooses to tell Nakshidil (the woman whose story inspired this novel) story from the perspective of Nakshidil's chief eunuch/servant Tulip. Perhaps that is Wallach's mistake. Tulip's tone is stilted and unconvincing. Though he demonstrates untimely knowledge of modern psychotherapy by encouraging Nakshidil to purge her soul in order to exorcise her demons, it goes no further than that. We never have the feeling that we understand who Tulip is, what he feels, what he has endured and what Nakshidil has experienced. This would be fine if the author hadn't introduced the possibility that we might have some insight into what these two people endured."
4,A Thoroughly Enjoyable Read,"I really enjoyed reading Seraglio. The descriptions of the Turkish palaces and people were very well done - very colorful - and felt like it transported me back in time.I feel as though it was well written, and liked that Tulip, Nakshidil's eunich, was narrating the story. It brings the reader through practically her entire life and the many changes that took place during the Ottoman Empire.This is a book well worth reading!"
1,Totally disappointing,"I continued reading and hoping that the book would get better. It didn't! The characters were really one-dimensional and I never ""cared"" about any of them. The premise is very much like Bertrice Small's book ""The Kadin, "" but Small's book has richer imagery, more developed characters, and a much more interesting conclusion."
2,Nothing great to say..,"We have bought this to replace Whirlpool Gold series that we have been using for 7 years. The installation was hard for the handyman.This one makes lot of noise while in operation. After few months of use, the handle broke and Maytag is of no help.Very poor product from a reputed brand.."
5,great tool for the office!,"I was worried about how my writing was coming across at work. (It's been a long time since grammar and spelling classes!) A recent promotion meant more corporate visability and more cc's on my e-mails. I needed a quick reference tool to help me as I went about my business correspondence. In addition to nailing down the basic rules, this book helped me with formats, usage, style, and all the little things that transform good writing into compelling material. I got rid of extra words and learned to get to the point. My point here is simple: Buy this book and look better in writing!"
2,Does not have a 10000 pound capacity!,"The item description is completely misleading, this tow strap only supports 3333lb or 1512kg (see pictures). The 10,000 lb limit (only shown in very small letters on the package) is only the rupture load where it is guaranteed to break apart.Otherwise this is a good quality product but if you have a heavy SUV or car that is more than 1.5 ton, this will not be robust enough."
3,A weird but interesting film,"I found this to be of decent dramatic value, but it was not what I had expected. I don't know why it is R rated because there is absolutely nothing offensive, or obsene in the 1:20 film."
1,Picture is wrong,"I own the ice packs that are pictured, and I bought this product hoping for more of the same. Unfortunately they are not the same. The old ones (the ones in the picture) do not freeze into hard blocks, but retain some flexibility. The ones sent to me freeze into hard blocks. Not what I was looking for at all."
2,Does the job but a few questions for Nikon???,Made of aluminum. I use mine on a Nikon Prostaff 3-9x40 Rimfire scope. Nikon USUALLY sets the bar very high.Update: I noticed that this sunshade has white lettering on the outside that detracts from the beauty of this cover. This advertisment for Nikon is in the wrong place or does it even need to be there?Also the sunshade screws into the scope threads ending up being a smaller diameter than the scope which makes it look like the wrong sunshade? What was Nikon thinking here? It works but I call it a poor design. Shame on you Nikon because you do make high quality scopes which I own several. I would NOT buy this again nor recommend it. If you need a sunshade be sure to look at the scope and sunshade together before you commit to a purchase.
1,Can't Believe This Is The Same Morvan!,"Like many readers, I adored Morvan Fitzwaryn in Ian & Reyna's book, but he turned out to be less than perfect here. He was kind of jerk, actually. My main problem with this book was that Morvan was not humble or appreciative of everything that just fell into his lap; it was more like - he wanted it, he should have it."
1,What Happened to This One?,"Sorry, Ms Hunter, but you really messed up on this one; not so much the storyline, but with the characters Anna and Morvan. You made Anna a very strong woman then turned her into a blithering fool when we were introduced to Morvan. This guy was awful, so unlike the other magnificant heros. I don't even know how to describe how much I disliked this guy and everything he stood for-which wasn't much. But he lacked honor, respect and character."
1,Just Didn't Sit Well...(Sorry),"This author is great, but this book's gotta go! Rewrite the thing, Ms Hunter and make Morvan likeable and give Anna her spine back. Everyone knows men ruled women back then, but rarely have I read a romance where the man didn't at least respect his woman - even a little."
1,Go to the library and check this out before you buy it.,"I read alot and always enjoy trying a little of this and that and enjoy trying out new authors. I really did try to read this book and finish it, but it just didn't do anything for me. It was boring and endless. It made no sense to me for a woman warrior, raised in a nunnery or not, to be so nieve about what went on between men and women. I haven't read anything else by this author nor will I."
1,There's Good Arrogance & Bad -Morvan Was Bad,"In the fantastic book, BY POSSESSION, Addis was arrogant but in a lovable, sexy, truthful way. Morvan is simply a pig. I know men dominated the women in that era, but at least M. Hunter's other heros respected, listened to, and truly loved their women! I'm surpised Anna had the confidence to help Morvan after the way he had treated her.Too bad Ascanio was a priest! Now THAT was a good, handsome, and decent man who deserved a woman like Anna."
1,"Sorry, But This Guy Morvan was a CREEP!","What exactly was there to like about this guy? It really grated on me that Morvan thought it was his due to wed Anna and take EVERYTHING away from her in an insulting and degrading way, treating her very badly in the process. For heaven's sake, Anna was miserable with this guy! All other books by M.H. are wonderful, but this one was awful."
1,So Different From What I Expected,"I love most of the characters in the series but this book was hard to admire, or even like. Morvan was so different from the other heros, who were sexy, handsome, loyal, intelligent, and they were men a woman could admire, but Morvan didn't even come close to being in this category. Nothing wrong with arrogant men, but when that arrogance is due to conceit, and puffed-up self importance, and the belief that one thinks themselves all-important and that one's own wife should grovel at your feet, that man has zero appeal."
2,"Madeline I Luv Your Work, but...","take the title of this book, for example. You MUST have been referring to Anna, not Morvan. She was the one who had to protect him! For all his boasts, he really was of no use to Anna, unless one believes that she was happy that he stripped her of everything."
2,"Okay, but not NEARLY as good as the other books...","Anna was a great heroine but not due in any way to Morvan, who made her feel inferior and saw fit to humiliate her at every turn. I don't know how this guy even ended up in a story by this otherwise great author. He was truly unlikable."
1,Didn't Like How Anna Was Stripped of her Dignity,"In other books by this great author, we have heroines kneeling for whatever reason and I found none of it offensive (because of the century and the context of the story) but somehow it didn't work here, perhaps because other heroines never had their dignity taken away in such a deliberate manner by the hero. That seemed the extent of the story to me, Morvan insisting Anna turn into an air-headed submissive woman."
2,I disliked Anna,"I can actually understand Morvan's character better given the 14th century backdrop of this novel. However, Anna sounded more like a 21st century feminist to me. She did not sound very genuine for a woman in that period. I wish Madeline had never written this book, given that this is the only one of her 11 novels (if I remember the number correctly) that I had to put down before reaching the end. I just could not take the characters, mainly Anna. However, I loved to see David drop by :)..Rags."
3,"OK, but not hunter's best work","I am a big fan of Madeline Hunter's past books, ""By Design"" and ""By Possesion"". However I was disappointed by her current offering, ""The Protector"". While the characters in this book were far more original, their relationships and dialogue lacked the spark of hunter's past writings. Morvan and Anna's relationship was rather bland compared to the intense emotion of her other couples. Overall worth the read, but not her best work."
1,I Was SO Disappointed...,"There was little about this story I liked, except for the priest Ascanio. Can't this wonderful, handsome warrior have his own story? And can't he take Anna away from Morvan in the process? Ascanio was a much better hero!"
1,terrible book,"Cute pictures, the end result of story is good, however, you have to read things like ""You jerkulous jerk"" and ""you are clumsy and dumb and you stink up the tree"" and ""you twerpulous twerp"" and many more insults. I am not interested in feeding such things to my child. If they hear horrible nasty things, I don't want it to be in a book that I encourage them to read. The fact that it turns out good in the end is great, but in the meantime I am also teaching them bad things to say. Horrific and disappointing!"
2,Shallow Diary of an Eating Disorder,"Chelsea Smith's diary entries become tediously repetitive in their adolescent appeals to ""God"". ""I'm so glad I have God"", she writes. I believe that faith can help those suffering from eating disorders overcome their obstacles to recovery, but Chelsea's book didn't really delve into the emotional roots of her eating disorder. The entire book reads like a pre-teen's diary (even her entries as a young adult), full of empty platitudes. Nothing new here. I recommend instead Cindy Nappa Bitter's book, ""Good Enough."" It opens up all the emotional agony that provokes an eating disorder, but in such a way that anyone can relate."
2,Not Impressed,"Vapid, self-important, and poorly written, this book is also chock full of religious claptrap and the rationalizing of a spoiled brat. I'm happy that Chelsea recovered, but can't believe that anybody decided that this ""journal"" was worth putting into print. Very few redeeming qualities."
4,Your entering the darkness......,"This is triple darkness very first release and features the ogrinial version of ""Cruise with Us"", which was not put on any other album......"
5,"A Godsend! If you live in the SW, this is THE book!","This book is well thought out, organized and highly informative. Trying to grow anything in the different soil and conditions found in the Southwest can be frustrating. Unless you can find a little gem of a book like this. It is like finding the key to a lost treasure chest. The book as a whole is indispensible. It walks you through soil condidions, there is a chapter on why the Southwest is different, has the usual list of perennials, annuals, trees, shrubs, etc. She also has a monthly calendar of to do items that I find extremely helpful. She includes cute sketches throughout the book and I am now studying the planning and landscaping examples in the back of the book. A MUST HAVE for any New Mexico gardener.Pat"
5,The very best New Mexico gardening book ever written!,"Although Roasalie died several years ago in her late 90's, she was still an active gardener. She was only sorry she couldn't do a new book and add lisianthus."
2,Don't buy this!,This knife became dull in 3 months with very little use. I only use this knife 2-3 times a week cutting meats and vegi's. Now I have to go get it sharpened as it can't even cut a pineapple properly.Better spend a bit more on a decent knife than on this low-end set.
3,good toy for a low price,"i've bought a couple of these for my room before, but they used to be only $3.99. i'm not sure about them being at $8.99, but at $4 they were great. if you want hours of fun, but it might break afterward, buy this. but if you want a durable hoop to keep for a long time, i'd go for something else."
1,Difficult to use,"I used the 1999 version for W95/98, which received an Editor's Choice award from Computer Times, however, I found this program difficult to use and lacking in flexibility. The 3-D features are nice, but getting a basic layout was very difficult to do, particularly since my lot is an odd shape. The help screens are not very helpful, especially in getting your basic design down. There were many pre-designed landscapes, but they didn't ""fit"" my situation. Limited selection of types and size of trees, shrubs, and flowers. I am an above average user of computers and software, but I don't have experience in design or drawing."
4,Home Design 3D -a lot for the $,"AutoCad or even Micrografx Designer it is not, but this little package provides quick almost painless floor plans and surprisingly useful 3D renderings. The learning curve is very short, particularly if you have some experience with other drawing software. Unlike some other very inexpensive software, this one gives you much, much more than you pay for. My biggest disappointment is the lack of flexibility and features found in the more powerful -and much more expensive- programs. Having a layers feature, for example, would greatly improve this program. Everything considered, this is a definite winner!"
5,Great Insults!,I have looked at other insult books and when I got this one and it had some of the best insults! They were great! This book is awesome!!
4,Ready for Action!,"Garfield has been my favorite comic strip for years. Here, he shares his wonderfully twisted tongue to combat those who would dare try to insult you with a few smart quips of your own. I laughed throughout this whole book, and I think you will, too. There are insults and barbs for all occasions and situations, so you'll always be ready. It's a small book, so you can tote it around for any surprise emergency. Great for any Garfield fan!"
2,Not that great.,This book was nothing compared to other garfield books. Save your money and buy the first book (ever) that's the best one.
4,A great book for beginning programmers.,"The increasing obsolescence of the QBasic language does not eliminate the need for fundamental programming knowledge for beginners provided by ""QBasic by Example."" Coding QBasic is an excellent stepping stone for learning how to program. Several fundamental programming concepts are covered in this book such as general program structure, if-then-else statements, and loops. The book also has important information for beginners on understanding how programs and computers work.I was a little disappointed that the book does not cover ALL of the QBasic commands. However, the most frequently used commands are explained very clearly with ample use of easy to read program examples and well organized chapters. The author obviously knows how the human mind learns best and this book images his experience."
5,This book explains the code,A lot of Qbasic books cover a lot of program structure and demonstrate that structure without first explaining the code thats in them. Qbasic by Example focuses on teaching you the code. All exhamples are simple and easy to follow. You can jump to any chapter and learn a command or keyword that you need without being lost. This is an excellent book. I use it as a reference manual.
5,Qbasic by Example,I thought this was an excellent book. It speaks to beginning programmers like i've never seen a Qbasic book do. It is not boring i thought it was pretty funny at parts. I definitly recommend this book to beginners
4,"Good Book, not quite as complete as I was led to believe.",I was disappointed that the book did not have a definition on every QBASIC command. I needed information about the PEEK and POKE commands.
4,Well done...,"Very nice book. This is the first book I read concerning programming and it got me up on my feet. If you have never programmed in anything before, I suggest this book. If you program in C or something, you should have enough sense not to buy it. I wish it would have said more about graphics, but it's supposed to be simple, so I can't really expect some wild effects. I guess I can sum it up in two words, ironically the same as the language: Quick and Basic."
3,"Outdated book, but valuable for some uses","The book itself is the ""learn by programming"" which works for some people and not for others. The others is mainly looking for answers for there problem which this bokk probably will not give you. However if you are inituative and can see outside the box you learn a lot of programming from the book and it is from the most basic to advanced topics included. The book is totally outdated since qbasic is replaced by visual basic. I however find it useful when I use an old scrapped PC which I build over to control units for all and everything, from alarmsystems to ROV control, even industrial control systems. Is it for the hobbyist... No not anymore, but for those few who still uses DOS machines it is a great tool"
5,"...whuwee, this some funky stuff...",...an arsenal of funk! this is music to both START and END your party to! why? BECAUSE IT'S JAMES BROWN AND HIS BOYS AND THEY JUS BE DOIN IT TO DEATH! this is music to check your pulse to.
4,good but not enuff funk cuz,"get the jb's double cd set for all these jams and plus extra funk goodies from jb, fred, maceo and the rest of the godfather's disciples."
3,J.B's,"This album is groovey, but it lacks one thing, James Brown's voice. With the exception of a few tracks like ""Pass the Peas"" (a classic), the album is comprised of JBB funk grooves sans-James Brown. If you're looking for a straight funk album I would look elsewhere, and if you're looking for some James Brown funk, I'd buy an album with him singing on it."
1,a disapointment,"The story is, if you can call it that, that a prominent icelandic soccer player comes out after a match so that he can be on the front page of a magasine. After that he gets kicked out of his club, finds a gay team (you don't see them play), they drive around to some small villages to play and ends up playing against his old team mates, and then the movies ends...oh yah you find out that he's been married, has an estranged son and he plays boyfriends with one of his gay team mate.Boring, boring, boring. I am sorry i wasted money on the film."
1,Who cares?,"Dull, confusing movie from Iceland about a gay football player coming out of the closet, much to the consternation of his family and teammates. This one is populated by incredibly unpleasant characters, not the least of which is the protagonist. Men, women, kids, gay, straight, there isn't a likable one in the bunch. It is hard to work up much interest in these people, or care in any way what happens to them.I'm not sure what ""Eleven Men Out"" is supposed to be: comedy, drama, comedy/drama? Whatever it is, it doesn't succeed in being any of them. Maybe something is lost in translation. Is it a message movie about acceptance and self-respect and being honest with others and yourself? Who cares?"
3,Missing Something...,"Not sure about this movie. I have seen worse, but the absence of a plot makes this movie seem sort of pointless. The father/son--mother/son dynamic was borderline lunacy and most definitely dysfunctional. I just did not get the gist of this movie and what the director was trying to convey. Not really recommending a purchase, perhaps a rental!"
4,Good to see a quality film coming from Iceland!,"This is a story of an Icelandic pro footballer who comes out of the closet only to be met with hostility from his team. He gets booted out of the team and goes off and joins a gay team with the aim to beat his former team mates in a match. A touching, well filmed story in Icelandic. Well worth it."
4,Waltzing Cavallaro,"This album consists of mostly pre-war recordings, which sometimes affects sound quality. Selection includes also several recordingsfrom 1950-60 period, after Cavallaro disbanded his orchestra and decided again to perform as a soloist. For numerous enthusiasts of his decorative pianistics this album is hopefully the first among many to come.Particularly the period 1950-1970 brought about many albums worthattention: ""Waltzing in the Dark"", ""The best of Carmen Cavallaro', ""Carmen Cavallaro Remembers Eddy Duchin"", ""Poetry in Ivory"" and many others, which deserve to be re-released on discs.Reviewed CD will make happy all Cavallaro's fans and should becomeshortly a collectible item. Nobody played like him and there is nobody who could replace his popular piano virtuosity."
3,Well now let me tell you.....,"I am somewhat disappointed in the CD because of the rambling on the key board and the lack of personal identification with the music. That is just my opinion. The CD is ok for background music for which I believe it was intended, but for serious listening, it is a little tiring. For ""Cocktail Piano"" music I supoose it would be fine."
5,Fifty-Two Ways to Change The Course of Your Life...Via Mental Makeover,"I am always, always open to mental makeovers. I mean honestly, one makeover will last you a short time, but you need to constantly re-evaluate and re-invent yourself to really sustain happiness. I was so excited to read this book, as it is right up my alley. And, with the new year around the corner, I wanted to share itwith others.There are 52... yes FIFTY-TWO ways to improve your days. And, there are 52 weeks in a year, right? That means, I can take one way and CHOOSE to make a mental change, work on it for a week before moving on the next one. I absolutely love that. I am so excited just sharing this. So, I can't say more than that right now, because it is only week one, but right off the bat I am stoked.And, I want to extend my condolences to Mr. McArt's family and friends, and fans. Thank you sir for creating this book, this year long mental makeover. Your legacy lives on."
3,Basic Awareness,The author brings his delightful humor to this writing as he invites the reader to consider and re-consider their thoughts and choices.
5,El la mejor memoria que he leido,"Soy aficionada a la lectura, y en especial las autobiografias y memorias me atraen, Frank McCourt definitivamente es el mejor, sus letras son reveladoras, dramaticamente expresadas, y un vocabulario sencillo y real del vivir cotidiano, su libro Cenizas de Angela es una historia que llega al corazon."
5,Amazing,I love this cd it is truly a blessing to hear Sandra sing. I had the pleasure of meeting Sandra when she was a young girl and her music is as pure as her heart.
3,Sage,"It's a little early to judge the efficacy of this product; however, it is as represented by the seller. I had a problem with my initial shipment. When I contacted the seller through Amazon, they were very polite and prompt in replacing the shipment. I will definitely do business with them again."
5,October 2004--Unanimous So Far,"These are the ones you're looking for if you want a piece of rock and roll/R&B history. Lloyd Price was there BEFORE Rock and Roll as we know it began, before Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis but on some parallel with Bill Haley and the Comets coming from a different direction. Elvis' first regional hit was in 1954; Lloyd Price's ""Lawdy Miss Clawdy"" hit in 1952. (Elvis and many others did their own versions later). My favorite is 1959's ""I'm Gonna Get Married"". If you buy this great collection of Lloyd's major works, you'll have a lot of good stuff from which to pick YOUR favorite."
3,Broker Jim -- a man you really like,"Everyone in Seattle has a not so happy story to tell about their recent adventures in the current bubble stock market -- chasing coffee, genetics and software companies. The author of this book has something new to say, about an older Seattle growing up. You learn about some of the less known start up businesses. You follow in the footsteps of a young man growing up in the most competitive of business worlds. This is an experience not to miss.Despite everything Broker Jim goes through, he remains a character you want as a friend. The cast of character's Jim encounters as he grows his business are as unusual as they are memorable. Broker Jim takes you across the country into the heart of depression era farming, the logging industry, into the big world of a stock brokerage.I liked the steady positive slant to a story most noted by the gutsy stick-to-itiveness attitude of the hero. It's a style that anyone wanting to follow a dream should hope to emulate."
3,Chocolaate covered wild huckleberries,"Kind of disappointing. LOVE huckleberries, and it was hard to find the huckleberries in this, the chocolate prevailed, and the chocolate wasnt very good"
3,Taste the Wilderness?,"I did not taste the wilderness, as the package said. They just tasted like chocolate covered raisins."
3,Are They Huckleberries?,"If you like chocolate covered raisins, you will like these because that's exactly what they taste like. They have no huckleberry flavor but are still good. If you want real huckleberry flavor I would get maybe jam or something."
5,"Very good, a nice change","This was good for a change and I would recommend people try it. This is not a product I would use regularly, but it is worth getting, especially for the Thanksgiving season."
1,Lousy service,Don't order this book from amazon unless you want to be told you will have to wait over a month for Amazon to deliver it. Order it from Barnes and Noble and get it quicker.
1,"The last reviewer was right, but too generous","This is a dreadful performance of the Threnody. It is so tame, it should be called Threnody for the Victims of Heavy Traffic. There is no horror here. In Wit's performance, Hiroshima is just a bad day, an inconvenience. Get the EMI double set instead and you will have the best Penderecki performances. You will also have the best Penderecki. His works after the first symphony are not that interesting by comparison and most of these symphonies are quite forgettable."
1,Uninterestin,"If you are looking for a view of Austria do not buy this video. It had some uninteresting boring interviews with a couple of people, showed some social balls, that seem to be the thing there, a little of the country side and not much else except for the close-up of buildings that looked like a short tourist shot. It was also short and that was probably its saving grace. If you can find it for $1.50 without shipping maybe it would be worth it. I would have to assume that anything else produced by this company would be up to the same quality and content."
3,If I could buy something better,"Though I am a Sony Guy, I am always looking for something better. The wife wants a Wega. We both agree the XBR looks better than without. I am excited about more options on the XBR. The light reflextion factors needs more research, I hate looking at features outside of the feature. As for PIP, it only works with local TV or Cable. Large and small dishes need a separate tuner for each picture within a picture. Because of the weight, I think a stand with wheels and lots of shelfs for the tuners would be my option. The price has dropped this week, but I'm going to try a place, where if you use a credit card they take off an additional 15%.P.S. The wide screen format of HDTV is interesting."
5,The best I got!,"We got this TV before New Year and all my family members love it. we have to fight for watching it since nobody wants to watch the old TV set. The picture is crystal clear with DVD and my son watched ""a bug's live"" no less 10 times. I had to settled down with 32"" screen because of my budget, but I am sure a 36"" model will be more impressive."
5,Great TV with sharp/clear picture and excellent sound,I've just returned my Panasonic 36' superflat for the 32 Wega XBR.The picture quality is far more sharper and clearer than Panasonic.The sound quality is the best TV sound I ever experienced. I am not a audio fan nor trying to build a home theater system. This set make it perfect for my need. The only downside is its price and the tv width. I couldn't afford the 36 XBR so I have to go for the smaller one. But it is still good. It is less than what I paid for the 36 panasonic superflat.
3,More Waves Than the Ocean,"My 36"" XBR WEGA exhibits video distortion in both thevertical and horizontal axis. Just watching ta stock ticker scrollacross the screen can make you queasy. Yesterday I noticed that some left justified screen credits also exhibited this wave effect while scrolling vertically. It's a shame that Sony's otherwise superb reputation must suffer by releasing a product that pushes the envelope of technology too far. Also, watch for patches of ""dark cloudiness"" that extend the full height of the display about 5 inches in from either side. Maybe a 32"" model works better, but if I could do it all over again, I'd shop around for anouther brand. I wasted alot of hard-earned money with this purchase, and I'd seriously take Sony up on an outright exchange. Does anyone know who to contact for this? END"
4,Great Pic...but why no 16:9 ratio?,"Its all been said...great picture, some reflections.......however the 16:9 ratio screen is available on the WEGA in Europe....so why not here? I can only suspect that Sony is trying to squeeze as much marketing potential out of the existing model...and then get us again when they decide to launch the 16:9 StateSide. However....remember that the 16:9 IS AVAILABLE NOW....in Europe......"
1,This Kit is Still Crap After 30 Years...,"I agree with the other reviewer that you should not waste your money on this kit (unless you are buying it for a die-hard collector of all things Star Wars), and instead you should go and buy the superlative Fine Molds 1/144 scale kit.This kit, which originally started life under MPC, was bought by AMT and Revell a few years ago and is still plagued by absolutely horrible mistakes with the detailing and proportions, the list of which would fill volumes. Some examples of the more obvious errors are the shape of the cockpit; the height of the sidewalls are too excessive, giving the ship a terrible ""fat"" look when viewed from the side; the decals are awful, and there are only three landing pads on the bottom instead of four. To rebuild this kit to make it more accurate would be an excessive challenge in and of itself, and you'll have wound up spending the money you could have saved and gotten the far superior Fine Molds' kit with it anyway."
1,Not worthy,"A lot of putty was needed and the kit was still a crap!! If you have money, buy the fine molds version."
2,Leaked!,Disappointed with this product - one of the two pans that I received leaked all over my oven! Expected higher quality from Cuisinart
4,Works well; cleanup tough,"I used this for a cheesecake which came out perfectly and beautifully browned, and I thinking super! This is definitely a winner. But then came cleanup and that was a bear. The narrow crevice along the bottom of the sides trapped the crumbs of the bottom of the cheesecake, and I found it tough to get that out (I don't have a dishwasher so I can't say if that's the diff) without a lot of Dobie work. The second time round, I discovered that presoaking it in warm soapy water made that a lot less work."
2,"I,m panning this pan","After over 50 uses, I am finally tired of this pan's flaws and am going to buy a better, albeit more expensive, springform. I make fruit tortes in the pan, and although the batter is very thick, it invariably leaks a lot. I have to put a baking pan under the springform or have a very messy oven. Plus I lose a lot of batter out the bottom. I have tried lining the pan with foil, which prevents the leaks, but makes for a somewhat mushy cake bottom. Even with nothing in the pan, you can see it does not have a great seal. ALSO, it is a pain to clean, as the batter cooks into the ridge around the base(where the sides sit), and you have to scrape it out with a fine-bladed knife or spatula. Cake doesn't slip readily from the base, so you have to serve the cake on the base, which is not only unattractive, but is non-stick, so you have to be really careful if you are using a metal cake cutter. This pan is definitely not worth the money."
2,Shiny but leaks,"This thing I tried when I received this pan was to test it in a water bath. It leaks! Sigh...why springform pans must you all have sort of problem? Either it's hard to clean due to the greaves and it's hard to clean, it warps, or most commonly the leaking issue.Luckily the cheesecake pie I'm making has a full crust that would solve the problem of leaking but who knows what horrors I will have to face if I ever decide to make a normal cheesecake or put cake batter in there."
3,Seems fine,"Seems to be quality but, havent used it yet. We have a lot of cheescake pans and this one seems to be to part with the $50 ones we have."
1,Leaks!,I tested this pan immediately upon unpacking it by filling it with water and it leaks like a sieve. I had to line it with foil before baking a cake in it--not very easy on a round pan.
4,"Authentic, tasty and easy to follow",Great authentic recipes (including Bun Bo Hue and rice crepes with pork and mushroom). The only downfall is that there are barely any pics.
4,Great Pan!,"This is my first springform pan. Super easy to clean, and made for an evenly cooked new york style cheesecake."
1,Wrong Size,This pan is advertised as 3 inches but is actually only 2 and 3 fourths inch high. I already had a pan this height. This pan is to be used for cheesecakes and I needed the extra quarter inch.
2,Not the right size,"This pan's description says it's 3"" tall, but that's before you install the bottom - then it's only 2-3/8"" tall! I'm not sure why Cuisinart thinks it's okay to measure the ring without the bottom for their specs, but if you need a tall pan, be advised this is not as advertised!"
4,Great for cheesecakes!,This has been great for cheesecakes. I've had very little leakage with this and the quality has been satisfactory. Would recommend.
3,average pans,I love to bake and do so quite often. These pans were great for the cost but of average quality. If I had it to do over again I would have spent a few dollars more for a higher quality pan. My favorite so far is Pampered Chef (although I HATE party type companies which is why I tried these instead) :(
5,Cuisinart Chef's Classic Nonstick Bakeware 9-inch Pan,If you find one of these in a store for this price you'd better buy it.
2,nothing special and its being phased out,As you know this is coated with a non-stick surface. They have been sunsetted by the govt due to health problems with the fumes they release. I have always used stainless steel spring form pans and I guess I will return to them.
5,heavy not flimsy,Nice strong base - does not feel like it can easily bend as some other springform pans I have used in the past.
2,Mine leaks too,"This was my first time using this type of pan. It's a nice, heavy duty pan that is definitely non-stick. The cheesecake was easily separated from the outer ring and turned out nicely. I had read the reviews about it leaking, so was ready in case this one did, and it did leak, even though I made sure it was snapped in all the way around. I put a pyrex bowl underneath the drip while it was in the oven and of course, once it started cooking, the drip stopped after about 10 minutes.I will keep looking for a springform pan that does not leak, if some has suggestions."
1,It's a leaker,"I read the positive and negative reviews on this product. The negative reviews said that the pan leaked. I decided to try it anyway. Did the water test first and the water poured through it. But, I tried the water test with pans I already have and they also did some leaking with the water test, but hold when I'm baking a cheesecake. I made a crust and put it in this pan, and when I pulled it out, butter was dripping out the bottom. I should have listened to the negative reviews. I will be returning this pan and finding a better one."
4,Very Good Pan,I made 4 cheesecakes in this pan. No problems with warping. It held up fine with easy clean up an no sticking so far. Thumbs up!!!
2,Leaks,"While washing the pan with water and the sides clamped, I noticed copious amounts of water leaking from the base. The half filled pan of water drained in about 30 seconds. I'm not sure if this was by defect or design. Granted batter is thicker and would exhibit slower leaking, I still didn't want to take my chances and am going for a supposed leak-proof pan instead."
2,Okay art but a boring substandard story,"The concept is such a mishmash rehash of the same old thing and not even as good as most of the competition. Reading through it I didn't see an original concept, story, characterization, or incident. 4 young guys adventuring out in shogun Japan... The artwork is mostly passable but, it's completely unoriginal."
4,Avante Garde Swing,"This is a swingin', joy-filled affair. Imagine the music the Cantina Band in Star Wars would have played had they been exposed to Jimmy Smith, Jimi Hendrix, and the lap/pedal steel (listen to Chicago Deep Dish and you'll see what I mean). To be certain, this music is laden with jive -- and by that I mean flashy, and, occasionally, cliched playing -- but who cares?! This is, after all, an unabashed groove fandango, and, I propose, just the type that everybody can use. Perfect for Saturday night with the hipsters, Sunday brunch with the folks, or the Monday morning commute."
5,MARTY SAILS!,Marty really knows how to sail and play those sounds so great for kick back listening! I love every cut... its long overdue... about time we see Marty center stage!
4,It was ok,"It was a gift for a friend, he already had the instrument and this complemented his fun time. I think he had fun with it."
5,A must see!,"If you're a fan of Guy Ritchie's ""Lock, Stock and Two Smokin' Barrels"" or ""Snatch"", you'll enjoy this film. ""Boys Don't Cry"" is more of a dark comedy than either of those two movies, but it's equally as whitty and just as hip.It's available with English subtitles."
1,Wiggles with a Scary Magician,"My almost 2 year old son loves the Wiggles, but this movie was not for him. I agree that this movie should be labeled for ages 3 and up. That magician was just too scary for him. We only have one other Wiggles dvd, ""Yummy Yummy"" which he loves (except for those puppets!)The Wiggles are great for the 18 months to 3 year olds as long as they keep singing and wiggling! That scary magician was just too wierd. We couldn't even finish the movie."
5,One of the Few Good Wiggles DVD,"My daughter in 12 month old and loves the songs, and the acts in this spectacular movie. What happened to the wiggles later on, I have no idea.I purchase Hot Popin Popcorn, and the best of the wiggles, and they were very disapointing. Especially when my daughter looked at me right away like what is this junk. We had to put The Magical adventure back on. Just purchased Sailing around the world and its o.k. not too bad. Hopeing that The Safari movie with the corwin will be better."
2,Not so good!,"I didn't like this movie at all. I thought it was boring and hard to follow. I have a 1 and 4 year old who both love the wiggles. Granted my 1 year old doesn't usually sit through a whole video, but he wasn't interested in this one at all. My 4 year old also lost interest quickly. We have several other Wiggles tapes( Yummy Yummy, Wiggle Time, Toot Toot) and they are much better and my kids love them.I also thought this movie was new, But it's not, It's from 1997. It looked old to me. Pick another wiggles tape instead."
2,The Wiggles decline,"The longer The Wiggles have continued, and the more they have strayed from their song and dance formula, the worse their films have become. Slicker production and uninteresting stories have intruded on the basic shtick and rendered the act mediocre."
2,Makes Children Cry,"The songs on this video are some of the good ones that we have all grown to love...and my 4-year old loves it. However, the main character is a bit odd looking, and he makes my 2-year old cry. So, we can never watch the whole thing at once. I'm also not wild about the ""magic"" theme for small children."
1,Not worth buying,This is not like the tv show at all! It is boring. My daughter would not even watch it!
2,This Movie Makes Me Feel Sorry For Greg.,"I'll have to admit that my favorite Wiggle, Greg, had been very careless when he informed Dorothy to hold his wand for a while and look after it. Both, Greg and Dorothy, didn't know about this one other person who's really not a magician-he's Greg's enemy. I think that stealing Greg's wand is like threating to kill him, and become the next Magician King in the Wiggles World."
1,Behind the Wiggles scene,Hi and I am 10 yrs. old. I watch this movie and it was silly even for me. My best friend is black. He emailed the Wigglesand asked how come he never saw a black on their shows. The publisist told him we like the show as it is. I stopped watchingafter that. Which turned out good. Now I get better more seriousthings done.
1,bad for kids minds,wiggles is not a good movie for children i think it is very brain washing i think this movie is almost as crazy as boobah
1,Love the wiggles but sadly not this DVD!,We have Toot Toot and my son adores it so I thought for sure that all wiggles DVD's would be just as great! I was sadly mistaken. This video has too much acting and not enough songs. My son was bored and I was extremely bored watching this video. I will keep looking since both my son and I love to dance to their music!

5,It's time for a Wiggley Magical Adventure! Great Movie,"I had no idea this was a full length feature film when I ordered. Really a great Wiggles movie...probably the best Wiggles DVD out of our entire collection. My 2 year old has tons of them, but personally...I think this one is great and he asks to watch it all the time. Look in the marketplace to possibly get it for well under retail price...that's how I got mine brand new. Just a tip!"
4,"Some love it, some don't","My son loves this movie, in fact, we've had to buy it twice because the first copy got scratched and he wanted to watch ""Wally""! My son watches it over and over...it has it's corny moments but what Wiggles show doesn't? My favorite part is when they go down Breezy Street (or something like that) and come out frozen - Murray looks so funny! I also like when they are wondering what Jeff is dreaming about, turns out he's dreaming about being a cow! I laughed out loud the first time I saw that part. I give it 4 stars only because my niece hates it...I think Wally bothers her."
4,A new US/CANADA release - not a new Wiggles movie,"Don't be fooled by the 2003 release date - this is not a NEW Wiggles Movie. It's been out in Australia for quite a few years. For those Wiggles fans, it definitely worth buying - it is a very cute storyline. Something different from their regular videos.Happy Wiggling!"
3,Disappearing act for the Wiggles,"My 3 year old son is a huge Wiggles fan, and planning to dress up as a magician for Halloween, so we were very excited to get this DVD. Thought it would be the perfect motivator for his creativity for the costume. Disappointing though... Greg only appears as a magician for maybe 90 seconds. The bulk of the movie concentrates on Dorothy and a new character (Wally the Magician). It does have a good story line and some fun songs, but most disappointing is the lack of an appearance of the actual Wiggles. The 4 guys appear briefly throughout the movie, but do not sing and dance as much as other videos."
4,annoyingly addictive,"I'm not sure what it is, but my 3-year old is totally addicted to the Wiggles and to this video. They are mildly annoying, but harmless enough. For some inexplicable reason, your kid will love this"
2,Stick with basic cable TV...,"Although our son loves the Wiggles, he wouldn't sit through the entire movie. This movie wasn't as entertaining and often dragged. The sound quality wasn't so great either. I'd rather watch The Wiggles on cable TV because it's more entertaining and educational."
5,Another Wiggly Hit,"After collecting all the Wiggles tapes and DVDs we had to add this one as soon as it became available. It was an immediate hit with our 21 month old son. He is only now starting to work on his speaking and we found this tape to be a big help. My thinking (such as it is)is that he finds the conversation easier to immitate than the singing. Whatever the appeal of this movie is for him, we all enjoy the new renditions of our all time favorite Wiggles tunes and the few new songs as well."
2,Not worth the money,"My 2 yr. old and I picked this as one of our first Wiggle DVD. We've only watched a few episodes on TV and my daughter loved them. Unfortunately, this movie was a bore. There were a few short parts that kept my daughters attention (some of the craziness and the Hot Potato song which was sung by children not the Wiggles). She kept saying, ""next song"" because there is quite a bit of dialogue and foolery between songs which she wasn't interested in. When we watch Wiggles we want to jump up and dance and dance and dance. Go for Wiggle Time. She loves it!"
3,Harmless kids' fun and tolerable for adults,"Although the movie is a traditional musical with impossible bursts of song intermingled with a flimsy but wholesome plot,it's still better than most of the kiddie fare. Wally the Wizard is a lovable bungler, and Dorothy gets the spotlight--she's always my favorite dinosaur!"
1,Very Disappointing,"My son is a huge Wiggles fan. He watches their TV show daily and has their Christmas Videos which he loves. This movie is very strange. There is a new magician character in it, who is bizarre and unkept looking. We thought this would be more like an extended version of their shows with a longer story line, but it's far from that other than the songs they perform. In addition, it seems to be very low budget and almost dark. I would not recommend this movie at all. Unfortunately, this was a Christmas present for my son, and we were all disappointed by it."
3,A bit too much for the little Wigglers,"My Son Loves the Wiggles but this movie was a bit too much for him. He sat through about half the movie, and I think that is because he is tired. The movie was nothing like the wiggles videos not that we expected that it would be. I imagine that when my 18 mos old gets older he will love this movie but for now I would say that if you have a child under 3 you would be better off waiting on this video. Now to the adults, before I say this let it be known that we are Wiggles fans in the house but for the adults this was boring. While a few moments might have been entertaining on the whole this was an incredibly hard movie to sit through. Usually I find the Wiggles excellent childrens entertainment and not too hard on adults but for me after watching this all I could think was I am glad that is over. I still give it three stars as good children's entertainment and will probably give it 5 stars when it gets my son to sit still for a full 70 minutes."
4,Only one this I do not like,First of all this is a great pan for baking bread. The bread turns out perfect and I have never had a problem with sticking. I have made a lot of bread with these pans and they seem to hold up great. The only thing I would like to see is just a bit of an edge on each end. That would make it easier to grab out of the oven. With that one change I would bump up my review to five stars.
5,BIG GREAT LOAF PAN...,"Cuisinart Chef's Classic Nonstick Bakeware 9-Inch Loaf Pan, makes Great Big Loaves, when I make Bread or any Cakes they get very Plump and Huge, they are one of my favorite Pans to Bake with and one of the Biggest ones I found. I have several of these Loaf Pans, four to be exact, and I'm always Baking with them, throughout the year. I wash them by hand and maybe that is why they still look like New even though I have them for years. Please Check Posted Pictures under the Item, Baking with Cuisinart Loaf Pan and Making the Best Banana Bread, step by step in Pictures with the Recipe. Thank You"
3,Nonstick Coating Doesn't Last,"I bought this pan because of the value and the Cuisinart brand--I own other Cuisinart cookware and like it. Anyway, the pan is quite sturdy and hefty. The metal construction is seamless and durable. Unfortunately, I found that despite the fact that it's nonstick, my breads would often leave a thin layer stuck to the bottom of the pan, whether the pan was oiled or not. I could live with that, though. What I could not live with, though, is that one day one of my breads came out with sliver flecks of nonstick coating embedded in its sides and bottom. Given that it didn't prove totally nonstick for me, I'd have preferred it not be coated and just be a durable pan that needed oiling."
2,Bad non-stick on a good pan,"After reading the many glowing reviews of this pan, my dear Hubby purchased 4 for our bread making. They worked great for the first few months. But even though we treated the pans with great care, greasing the pans each time, washing them carefully by hand with a soft sponge, and storing them with paper towels in between each pan, the nonstick still flaked off on the bread. Soon large silvery sections of non-stick coating had to be cut out of our bread loaves! Such a waste of both good bread and what could have been a fabulous loaf pan! Now I'm looking to replace these pans which should have lasted for many long years of use. But who wants to eat toxic nonstick? So unless you bake only a few times a year, purchase different pans!!"
2,Disappointed.,My biggest disappointment is that this pan scratches and rusts. I would recomment trying the Chicago Metallic loaf pans.
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"I am very disappointed in the quality of this pan.The pan came with minor defects and easily scratchedin storage. My guess is Cuisinart need to put ""chef""in front of description to sell product. In this case,you get what you paid for @ $6.99. I returned the pan."
4,I love It,"My daughter got this for her 4th birthday, she loves to play with dolls, especially hair and has practically learn how to cornrow because of it. I like that it had accessories for her as well. Having a doll that is closer to her skin complexion is more realistic for her. Girls spend a lot of time with dolls and I don't want her to develop any complexes. I do wish there was some kind of storage unit in the base of the head to keep track of the accessories."
5,Choir of angels,"No doubt any admirer of Robert Shaw and his magnificent career will want his final recording. The liner notes, and radio broadcast, are certainly poignant, knowing that Shaw has since passed away. Robert Woods, of Telarc, gives a detailed, emotional description in the liner notes of what happened at this recording. The music, alone, is evidence of Shaw's mastery and he honors Dvorak and all other composers with his gift."
2,Interesting but......,"This DVD should be called ""The Life an Times of J.R.R. Tolkien""It is interesting enough, however..... The description leads you to beleive that this DVD will offer you an in depth study of the story and characters in the Hobbit when in fact it does not. It tells you alot of interesting facts about Tolkien and gives a few opinions about his inspirations for writing the Hobbit, but nothing that you wouldn't be able to arrive at through your own thoughts. I was disappointed because I was under the impression that there would be ""secrets"" revealed about the events and characters in ""The Hobbit"" and there were none. If you are interested in Tolkien's life then this is for you, however I'm sure that there autobiographies out there that would prove to be more useful."
2,Where's Bilbo?,"I'm not sure I remember Bilbo's name being mentioned in this hour long + dvd. Suppose he must have been mentioned in there somewhere....Good stuff: entertaining and informative interviews with Tolkien himself, John and Priscilla Tolkien, Rayner Unwin, Tom Shippey, and Humphrey Carpenter.Not so good stuff: way too much of an inane narrator of the Tolkien bio, way too much of the Hildebrandts talking. No noticeable focus on The Hobbit as opposed to LOTR. And a strange segment on the music of Middle Earth.Borrow this one."
1,Weak Music,"Upon listening to this CD I understand why Gottschalk is noted mainly for his piano compositions. I found the whole CD weak musically and the orchestration nave. It seems as if these pieces are piano works that want to be orchestral compositions when they grow up.I have several other CDs by this conductor, not sure of his credentials, who seems on a mission to champion the music of the unknown composers. While I applaud his work in bring the music of composers of color to the public's attention I must say that there are many more notable Black and Hispanic composers who deserve to have their music played before we go dipping into this well of musical obscurity.I think that this conductor needs to ask himself something that many musicologist ask before wasting time on second rate composer: why is a composer's music not known in the first place?"
5,A good source of information for planning a visit,"Not bad. Each hiking trail has 2 to 3 pages written about it and a couple of color pictures. The length (in miles), point to start, and elevation change is listed for each trail. We have two small children and are using this book to plan our visit to the park so we don't go to the wrong area. The shortest trail listed is 0.1 miles and the longest is 16 miles (round trip). The highlights of each trail (water fall, lake, view, etc.) are briefly described. I am happy I bought it but the maps are cut up (to cover each individual area of the park)so prior to visiting the park I still will need to purchase an overall map of the park."
2,Incomplete Guide,"I've lived less than an hour away from Estes Park for over 40 years and hike in RMNP quite a lot...This book covers a FEW destinations in RMNP and completely ignores many wonderful day hikes.Some of the route descriptions are actually TOO detailed for my taste (pages long in some cases) and I'd like to see more maps.I do like the format of the book, I just wish it had more information.I prefer Lisa Foster's Rocky Mountain National Park - The Complete Hiking Guide. Her book covers EVERY one of the 440 destinations in RMNP - and she has been to EVERY one of them. She knows what she's talking about and her book is EXCELLENT! I've been to about one hundred of the destinations, so I know that her book is accurate. As I said though, her book covers EVERYTHING in the park - short hikes and very long hikes. It's probably more information than most people need."
4,Very helpful,"I purchased this book to help me decide what trails I wanted to hike in Rocky Mountain National Park. I just returned - I was very glad I had this downloaded on my kindle. Between the maps the park provides and this book I was able to make the most out of a short visit. My only complaint would be that the trailheads were not clearly defined by what stop on the park shuttle. When visiting the park you should take advantage of the shuttle system. Also, some of the trails were not in the park ie Gem Lake."
5,Filmed in my area,I just recently saw this movie and I love it. Several scenes were filmed in my neighborhood (Williamsburg and Greenpoint sections of Brooklyn). I was too young back then when the scenes were filmed. I think Spike is hot-looking.
1,fool of bensonhurst!,"I heard of this movie in 1988 I didn't see it, when I saw a list of movies of the 1980's that wasn't transfered to dvd I brought the vhs tape to see it for myself. I know the film suppose to be a comedy but I didn't really laugh at. I didn't like how the puerto ricans was presented they didn't have any pride in themselves they believed in the italians like their gods who was coming to save them from drug dealers I just think it wasn't funny as a black person watching this film."
1,Terrible! Do Not Buy!!,"I wish I could give this product 0 stars because that is what it deserves. I got it home and took it out of the box, filled it up, and stuck my feet in. The Bubble, Massage, and Heat button did not work, which was irritating because I just bought it. Then, I noticed my water was disappearing. I picked it up and it had leaked water all over my new carpet!! If this is the quality of your products, then I will never buy another Homedics product again."
3,Low Budget CD!,"I agree with the previous reviewer: the KC songs are NOT the originals, but Silver Convention songs are the familiar versions. The only thing I want to add is if you want this album, don't pay more than a normal ""low budget CD"" price. If you are a huge KC & The Sunshine Band fan and are actually looking for ""potential demos"" or something different of their familiar hits, then get this (I'm thinking that maybe these songs WERE demos at one time). It contains no liner notes, no pictures, nor lyrics."
2,who's playing live?,"It is incomprehensible, if not insulting, that SONY/BMG includes no information about who is in the live band, when it was recorded, or at what venue."
2,Not what I was expecting,"If you are looking for a book that describes what a CRM is, why you would want one, how you can use one and how SugarCRM may be right for you, then this is a great reference.But, if you know what a CRM is and why you need/want one and are hoping to learn how to add features/functions to SugarCRM to meet your specific business needs, then this is not your book, especially because of its price."
1,Not my first choice,"I was surprised that nearly a third of the book had absolutely nothing to do with implementing SugarCRM, and the remaining sections were truly vague. If you want a book that describes generic concepts about what a CRM is and why you might want one, this book is for you. If you don't have a clue what a CRM system is, this book is a nice primer. In fact for the first third of the book, I believe it mentions other CRM products more often than Sugar.If you are actually trying to implement SugarCRM and expect this book to show you how to change a single setting to customize it your way, you will be sorely disappointed. There are vague references to things like ""use the admin panel to change user permissions"" but nothing more detailed than that simple phrase - and very little of that."
5,A Great Read,"This author clearly understands small and medium business, and Sugar CRM - I would recommend this book to anybody. Worth every penny!!!!!!!"
3,Southern Charm,"""Gentle southern charm"" comes to mind -- funny (if you ""get it"") and with a subtle message. Nothing hits you over the head, no explosions, no F-bombs, just a nice ""feel good"" fun movie. We loved it. Safe to watch with your Momma."
3,Cute,"This was a cute, insightful drama about man named Randy who in order to impress his wife, goes into debt with the mob. The mobsters come for him when he is unable to make good the loan, sending a very odd mobster named Tino to claim the debt. Tino is funny at first, but after awhile I found him someone annoying and overdone.I did think Randy's gay brother was very well done, and so were the other mobsters. While I wouldn't watch this one again, I still found it amusing enough.3 stars."
1,NERFPOOP,"This toy comes with 6 pieces, total. The first line of the instructions is ""1. Push the hoop bracket through the hole from the back."" The picture is of what you can assume (although it's never stated) is the ""hoop bracket"". You are supposed to put this bracket through the hole in the back of...what? They forgot a word. What was the word they forgot? It's a really, really hard word, so stay with me here...THE BACKBOARD. I guess they ran out of funding for ink. The boardroom meeting must've been brutal. ""NO! We simply cannot afford to add the word 'backboard' in the instructions! I mean, LOOK AT THE PRICE OF INK!!!"" The instructions get worse from there.This product is made by Hasbro, a name that warms the childlike cockles of my heart. It's a name I heard first while rolling around in deep pile carpet and watching Speed Racer and playing with Mr. Potato Head (Hasbro) and G.I. Joe (Hasbro). They should know better."
1,Brains of Nerf...,"Nerf has managed to destroy what was once a simple, fun, and durable concept. I strongly suggest consumers purchase a cheap knock-off with the old-school metal hoop mount."
2,My son loves it but.....,Not well constructed. My son loved it while it lasted...for about a day. The back board will break off. I reconstructed it a little and my son still uses it in his room. You get what you a pay for I guess. On the bright side the ball is round.
2,Cheap,"Son still gets his 13 year old buddies to shoot hoops on this toy and horseplay, even if it is the cheapest thing on the planet and held together with duct tape. buy something sturdier."
2,Ugh.,The design for this toy is moronic and the directions are worthless. And I'll second others' complaints about the backboard. It's hard to believe someone actually got paid to design this thing.
1,PIECE OF JUNK!,"I really hope my child's teacher didn't pay full price for this item. It is a such a piece of junk. I knew as I was putting it together and realized the backboard was cardboard that it wasn't going to last long at our house and of course, I was correct. This toy lasted one evening before it was down and the net was off of it and the cardboard backboard was damaged. The directions also weren't very clear and were hard to understand.I did give it more stars for entertaining because the kids did love this but it just isn't durable enough to give it anymore than 1 star total. I would say this is worth $5 at the most. If you pay over that, you are getting ripped off."
1,ugh.,"The instructions were horrid - see above reviews. It repeatedly fell apart. In less than a week, our 4 year old destroyed the backboard. In less than a day, our 2 year old found the ball we thought we hid and bit chunks out of it. This was the saddest birthday gift our son received."
3,Price gouging,"Amazon sells this for $22, but you can buy the same product at Toys R Us for $6. This isn't the first product I have seen that either Amazon or a partner sells through Amazon that is double or triple the price elsewhere. Amazon used to consistently have competitive prices on items they sold new, but apparently not any more. Amazon, what gives?"
3,it was ok,"both my parents have fungus on their nails, it helped but didnt heal as fast as we wanted to, but a good product nevertheless"
3,Not for Nail Fungus,"I bought this product for a discolored big toenail and when I received it it clearly displays on the bottle that it is, and I am quoting from the bottle, ""This product is not effective on the scalp or nails."" It was so cheap I'm not going to return it, but just don't purchase for nail fungus."
1,FRAUDULENT PRODUCT - DOES NOT WORK,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - IT DOES NOT WORK. I have only a minor condition to be treated, and I used it religiously, and it did nothing. In fact, it even made it worse in that is dyed my toes a hideous bluish color."
1,This is NOT an acid!,I tested the acidity of this product with litmus paper and another pH paper with a scale of 0 - 13. Neither of the papers changed color even the slightest.
3,It's fun!,it's like the cheap version of scene it. Great if you don't have the $50 to spend on scene it... good for a large group/party!
3,A Little Different From The Norm,"It took time but this album has grown on me. The jazzy element on certain tracks for me made this a little different and refreshing from the usual SRV clone blues that we seem to hear from certain quarters, maybe just a question of taste.Troy's voice does seem to be in a rather similar vain to Corey Stevens and Indigenious, in that its a little different and not (in Troys case) immediately appealing to the ear. Again time seems to heal this. The songs are all Ok but there is nothing really outstanding on the album or anything really bad. The guitar playing is fine throughout and for this reason I purchased the CD.In short a little different and this makes it a slightly better than average album but hope Troy continues on to make a second album if for nothing else the guitar work alone."
1,At best this album is OK,This album has 1 good song (Going Back To Louisiana) the rest of the album is just a waste of time. The artist's problems stems from two things (1) he can't sing. (2) he foolishly tries to mix jazz and blues - it works for some artists but not for Troy Turner. Buy Live On by Kenny Wayne Shepherd instead.
1,AWFUL!,"This game stinks! no better way to put it, I think that you would enjoy Swat 2 instead or black and white, I wish I never bought this one."
2,I only give it a 2 for effort,The version I was shipped was more like a Christian devotional text than any serious comment on the multi-volumed Rg Veda. There are better printings out there... count the pages and read the reviews!
5,Great CD,"I just picked up Buckcherry's new CD, Time Bomb. If you liked the first album, you'll definately like the second. I love every second of the CD. There are a few excellent songs (""You"", ""(Segue) Helpless"", ""Open My Eyes"") that made me really listen to the music and some great, raunchy (for lack of a better word) songs like ""Porno Star"". Joshua Todd is an excellent lyricist and his voice fits the music perfectly. Keith Nelson and Yogi made up some great guitar riffs and Jonathan ""JB"" Brightman and Devon Glenn do an outstanding job on the bass/percussion end. All around great CD! Go get it!!!"
4,Buckcherry tops themselves.,"Great rock album. At least somebody knows how to get some good rock out. Without You, Helpless, and Opened My Eyes give off the mellow vibe, both rad songs. Buckcherry let's it all out on Frontside and Time Bomb. An awesome album that gets put right in the front of the new rock and roll category."
4,Music to my ears,"Buckcherry's self titled debut album was a nice reminder of what rock and roll should sound like: no whining lyrics, rap rockers, or downtuned guitars. ""Time Bomb"" continues this trend, and finds the band honing their skills. Standout tracks include the rip roarer single ""Ridin'"", the nasty ""Porno Star"", ""Slit My Wrists"", ""Place in the Sun"", ""Whiskey in the Morning"", and the hard rocking title track. Now more than ever Buckcherry is displaying the fusion of classic hard rock with punk energy that is so desperately needed in the hard rock world today, and if their debut album and ""Time Bomb"" are of any indication, the best is hopefully yet to come from this promising band."
3,Dissapointed,"After discovering this band from believe it, or not MTV!! I bought their first cd immediately, and was'nt dissapointed. This new cd was a huge letdown. There is a couple of good rocking tunes, but the cd is only about 45 minutes long. I'm hoping their next effort will be much better."
3,Pleasing sophomore effort,"A good rocking album that is fun to listen to. Unfortunately that's all it is. I was half expecting a classic to follow up the incendiary debut album, and haven't really felt an urge to listen to this for a while. It's not bad, just a slight disappointment."
3,"Not bad, but something's missing","Timebomb is a disappointment after Buckcherry's first CD, but I can't say specifically why. Something just seems to be missing in the song writing. There are still some good hooks and musically it actually rocks harder than the first CD, but the songs didn't resonate with me. I didn't find myself singing them days later. In fact, the first time I listened to Timebomb, I didn't like it at all. I had to listen to it two or three times to get into it. ""Porn Star"" and ""Whiskey in the Morning"", despite their subject matter, are two good tracks and the ballads aren't bad . I would also say the singing gets irritating. Josh Todd seems to scream his way through every song instead of singing. Timebomb is loud, in-your-face and raunchy but it's not as balanced and enjoyable as their first release."
3,not enough rock and roll,"there are a couple of really good songs but the rest is lame, some of the lyrics are just dumb!"
1,Been there done that,"This album lacks originality. There is nothing on this album that we all haven't seen before. Because it is on dreamworks, it obvious this is a band of studio musicians. Please people, use your minds and think for yourselves."
1,I REALLY DON'T LIKE THEM,THERE OLD STUFF IS THERE OWN STUFF BUT THERE NEW STUFF SOUNDS LIKE AC/DC AND AEROSMITH.THE GUY EVEN LOOKS LIKE AEROSMITH.THE GUITARISTS LOOK LIKE THE AEROSMITH GUITARISTS.DON'T BUY A CD LIKE THIS.IF YOU WANT TO FINE.ITS JUST MY OPINION.PLEASE BUY IT IF YOU WISH.BUT IF YOU ARE NOT REALLY INTO THEM DON'T BUY IT BUT IF YOU LIKE THEM PLEASE BUY IT.
5,Meant to be loud; meant to get inside,"Following their debut album, which was one the best albums of 1999, Buckcherry had their work cut out for them. First listen, they didn't accomplish it. Second and consecutive listens, I wasn't listening the first time. If hard, driving rock (yet with MELODY, which is missing in so much of hard rock today)is what you miss, this album, this band, is what you are looking for in your music. This album is much richer than their first, but may take a couple listenings if your listening for the automatic hit riffs that were present in their first album. I would vote for ""Porno Star"" and ""Slit My Wrists"" as the hit releases, but many a parent group would be up in arms over those two songs. (Good, that's what rock needs more of these days) Buy it, play it loud, and let it get inside you!"
1,Not as advertised,"Almost everything I buy from Amazon is supurb, but description of this cane did not suggest that cane was decorated - only that it had an aluminum finish - very disappointed. Will use, because it is quite sturdy and easy to disassemble/reassemble, but I would have bought a different cane if the description or picture had shown what the cane was really like"
4,I'm In The Minority Here,"Overall I loved this performance, especially the performances of Domingo and Neblett. Yes, she may have been overtaxed in the role at times, but for me the chemistry between the two of them was wonderful. He with a soft edged machismo and she as the tough woman in the wild west but with an obvious feminine side. I found both the characters very believable. Carolli was acceptable but not great. Wish it had been Milnes as in the recording on the DGG CD. The production values are good but the age of this recording shows. It definitely does not have the sharpness of more modern recordings. I've not seen the La Scala DVD mentioned here but I've heard it on CD and while Domingo is as good as always, I find Zampieri's voice just plain ugly."
2,"Great Visuals, Abysmal Singing","The Girl of the Golden West is almost funny in its use of a Western (as in USA) as an operatic vehicle. The real strength of this production is that looks like a western and the men and Minnie, the important female, look like characters from a western. The sets are excellent. The acting was also good. However with the exception of the male lead, Ramirez (alias Dick Johnson), played by Placido Domingo, the singing is extremely wobbly and, in the case of Minnie, the singing was so inaccurate that I could not even imagine what the musical intent was.La Fanciulla. . . is a good opera that anyone could enjoy. You should not buy this version when an musically excellent La Scala production is available on both DVD and VHS."
5,Makes camping sooooo much easier,"I don't use it now (don't camp anymore!) but when my 4 children were younger, and we did camping with both Cub Scouts and Girl Scouts and also as a family, it was a godsend. Easy to pack and take and easy to clean, it helped me to make sure I always had a place to work and prep food so that the kids could use the table at the camp grounds. It was also easier to keep them safe from the propane camp stove. I confess we never used the game boards, but I didn't care!"
3,Great Product - Not a Bargain at this Price,"We've used this cat food for years... LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT! Since I like to order from Amazon, I decided to give this supplier a shot. I was not paying attention, and it cost me. I paid the same amount for a 7 lb. bag from this supplier that I would for nearly twice that amount at PetSmart.com. Next time, I'll stick with PetSmart. I ended up paying about $1.50 per pound too much. Good thing my kitties are worth it!"
2,Disappointed...,"Look this isn't easy to admit, but for the past several months I've been suffering from hairballs. Science Diets so called ""Hairball control"" formula claims to treat this very serious and problematic issue, but I'm sad to say that it was of no help to me.First off a little backstory on the hairballs: My wife as a rare skin condition that causes excess hair growth over 90 percent of her body. It's not a joke, so please don't laugh. At night she sheds, and, during our occasional love making sessions, I find myself inhaling much of her body hair, thus leading to the above mentioned problem. A problem which, Science Diets product failed to help me with.EDIT:If this formula really is only to be used on cats, as some on this site have suggested, then I say it should be labled as such, so as not to fleece unsespecting customers."
3,For the completists,"Hey, its DCFC. You like them or you don't.If you do, and you have all their other stuff, then I guess you better get it. If you just have a couple of their albums, then your money is better spent on a full album. With just 2 unreleased tracks (good as they may be), I suggest waiting for a less expensive used CD.Don't get me wrong though...this is good music. Better than a lot thats out there. There just isn't enough of it."
4,Flight of the Migrator,"This isn't as good as The Dream Sequencer, but it is still quite good! Before I say anything else, I have to say this: The song Into The Black Hole is the best I have ever heard Bruce Dickinson sing on anything! I don't know what it is! Maybe he was meant to sing in a more progressive band than Iron Maiden! I don't know! Anyway, this CD is much heavier than The Dream Sequencer and has some unforgettable guitar parts (which isn't suprising, as Arjen is a hell of a guitar player and songwriter!). This is a must for any Ayreon fan, and if you're not an Ayreon fan, you should be! Progressive fans should like this! Get it, listen to it! No one can do a 'Space Opera' as well as Arjen Lucassen!"
2,Boring Metal-Mish Mash: A Recipe for Mediocrity,"Take a big pot. Throw in a dash of Ronnie-James-Dio-era Rainbow, a little Yngwe Malmsteen, and a heaping helping of repetitious, churning, boring heavy-metal chords. Top off the mix with a layer of bad, flat, muddled production. Mix together. The result approximates the sound and flavor of ""Flight of the Universal Migrator."" Other than an occasional nice guitar solo or keyboard solo, this has little to offer. It's a monotonous, unvaried metal mish-mash and falls far short of the standard set on such works as ""The Dream Sequencer"", ""Into the Electric Castle"", and ""The Final Experiment""."
5,"Universal Migrator Pt. 2, Quite a journey.","I came across part 1 in a used music store and liked the first part of the journey and just had to find part 2. Glad I did, great progressive music, I will consider other works by Ayreon."
4,Funny,I believe this is the best of the all star comedy jam DVDs. Pure comedy for all over the age of 21.
2,Bad Bad Bad,"Not much I can really say, but I will say that Aries Spears was the only truly funny person on the DVD. I always thought he was pretty good on MadTV and I had no doubt he would deliver a good set. Additionally, I was also a bit surprised to hear what he referred to the women in the audience as....In terms of the other comedians it was pretty much the same formula. Which is pretty much: Ensure every other word that comes out of your mouth is a cuss word, jump around a lot, and lastly, make sure you tell nothing but grating and stupid ""yall know that's right!!"" -esque jokes.It's been awhile since I sat and watched this type of comedy and now I know why. The material is to limited and delivery of the jokes is simply just to overdone and similiar to evoke any laughter from the viewer for more than 15 minutes."
3,I Gave It a 3,"I gave it a 3 because 3 of the 5 comics were funny. Cedric is always funny, I didn't even know Tommy Davidson was so funny, and of course Kevin Hart was ridiculous!!! The other two? No. They BOTH called women in the audience ""b*tch"" and I find no humor in that at all. Aries Spears called a woman in the audience a b*tch at the very beginning of his act! Deray finds being offensive funny. His act wasn't funny at all. Glad 3 of the 5 were funny, otherwise I'd be upset I bought this."
5,Funny!!!,"My husband and I use to watch the ""Original Kings of Comedy"" with Bernie Mac... Since his passing this is the next best comedy we have seen thus far. Too funny!"
4,All-Star Jokes,"I first seen this special on SHOWTIME back in july... and It has been saved in my DVR box every since!This has to be one of the most funniest stand-up specials that I have seen in a loong while. The jokes are current and (sometimes) risky; The presentation is great (be sure to watch the end credits); and the comedians are at their best (Dee ray and Kevin Hart are the highlights for me).I would say the only down side is the opening performance (Tommy disappoints), and the special is a little bit on the short side;(or I just didnt want it to end... either or!). But other than that, I would say this dvd is a must buy for any stand-up fan. (Watch it with friends or family, makes it more fun)"
2,Neat ending ruins good book,"I really enjoyed this novel until I got about 60 pages near the end. Throughout the whole book we read about the anguish of Gabriel trying to understand his sexuality, and just as things are reaching the climax the author throws in another twist, wraps it all up in a neat little package and ruins a perfectly good novel.It was kind of like how the character ""abuses"" himself at night thinking of men, and right before he's finished he substitutes a woman's face to make himself feel better. I feel like the author did the exact same thing to the reader."
3,Coming Out (Early) Story,"The author provides good character development and is a good story teller. The point is made that the influences of family and religion cannot overcome our genetics; it can make us unhappy if we deny our true self, however."
3,"Well Written, Not Very Entertaining","This book is about Gabriel, told by him beginning when he was a small child ending in his late teen years. He is picked on because he is sensitive and not interested in 'normal' boy activities (sports, machines etc.). As he grows up he realizes he's homosexual and tries to 'cure' himself through prayer and other techniques. The story seems to revolve around him dealing with homosexuality in Catholic Ireland. I thought the book was well written and flowed well, but at the end I wondered what the point was. It would have been much more interesting if the story had been condensed into maybe the first quarter of the novel and ended in his adult years. Just when he seems to come to terms with it (not sure if he still thought it was just a phase at the end) the book is over. I would've been more interested to see how he deals with it as he becomes an adult, his first relationship etc. Overall it's an ok read, but not much more."
5,"Great Film, features ""New Years Gang.""","Very good film about the topic in general, + it's one of the few resources available on the ""New Years Gang."" Highly recommended."
5,"So nice, I bought it twice!","This is the second copy I have bought, relatives keep taking it! What a wonderful collection!"
1,Glad to see I'm not the only one,My hair is fried from using this hair dryer. Burnt hair. I've been using this for almost a year. I THOUGHT my fried hair was due to the curling iron I was using so I stopped using that about a month ago. My hair still is getting fried thanks to this catastrophe of a machine. DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT IF YOU LIKE YOUR HAIR!
1,do not buy,"I purchased this hair dryer 5 months ago and the end melted because it gets too hot. Yes I use the diffuser, but it comes with the product and it should not melt when used. Avoid this product."
1,Dangerous,"This dryer gets too hot. Even on the warm setting it must be moved very quickly while being used to avoid burning your hair. But there is a worse problem. The coils are too hot for the casing material and the casing is melting. And just in case you are wondering, no, I don't ever use the concentrator that restricts the airflow. Can't imagine what might happen if I did."
4,Nice dryer for a reasonable price,"I purchased this hair dryer a few years ago. After about a year of use, I too noticed very high heat (even on low heat settings), lack of air flow, and melting plastic. However, I noticed lint and dust collected on the back of the hair dryer! I removed the plastic cover on the back and cleaned out all of the dust. I noticed an immediate difference - lower heat and much better air flow! And, the more I used it, the more I realized that the plastic stopped melting! So, I do not believe this to be a faulty product. All hair dryers collect dust and lint that affect their functionality. Just periodically clean your blow dryer and it will last for years. This revlon does not dry out my hair (though I always use a heat protection cream) and dries it efficiently (I have A LOT of hair). Take care of your things and they will take care of you."
1,Burned the living hell out of my hair!,"Is it possible to give a product zero stars? That's what I'm trying to do. If the app doesn't let me, then one star will have to suffice. I have owned this hair dryer for less than 6 months. I have never used the concentrator attachment. I agree with the other reviewers that stated that the dryer becomes too hot. The end is melting, the inside gets bright red (and sometimes I see white sparks), and best of all, my hair is now completely fried from using it. I consider myself lucky that I never actually lit my hair on fire while using this dryer, but I think that's a distinct possibility, what with the shooting sparks. Don't buy this dryer!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!,This has to be the worst hair dryer I have ever purchased. There is barely any air flow. It takes 3 times as long to dry my hair with this than any other hairdryer I have owned. I haven't had it long enough to experience the breakdown of the product but it is going back ASAP!! Definitely would not recommend!!
3,Could be better...,"I work as a volunteer with Habitat for Humanity and recently had to travel with my tools to Georgia for the Jimmy Carter Work Project. Well the airline lost my tools, they went to Las Vegas and I landed in Atlanta...another story. Regarding the bag. The size is great, which may make it it's downfall. You can pack an incredible amount of stuff in there. Unfortunately the pull out handle for the rollers is made from light weight square aluminum and bent under the load. Also the shafts where the handle slides in gets dented very easily and makes pulling out the handle difficult. I resorted to never pulling out the handle full length and stooping over to pull it along. The whole handle assembly must be beefed up and protected better."
5,Is this the best album of 2000?,"Oh my god! Heads... listen up! This could be the best hip hop album of 2000. I have not heard a more innovative, diverse and fresh collection of music since the first Quest album. This is hot. If you like obscure samples and beat tracks, so hypnotic they make you cry. And mind bending lyrics that flow like plasma you must get this album! These kids have engineered a new era of hip hop. DJ Elp-Mass is the new bonafide king of the artform with this truly magic rendering."
2,Disturbing,"I have to agree with a previous reviewer. I love the American Girl series and read them as a little girl. But the Kirsten series was very disturbing, and I also ran to my mother crying because one of the character's died from cholera. I was 10 or 11 at the time. Maybe I was a sensitive child, but I really didn't like the Kirsten stories. I would definitely not buy these as a gift for the little girls in my life."
5,How do you get a frustrated dislexic little girl to read?,"Find a story she cannot put down. I bought this series in hopes of engaging my 10 year old grand-daughter, and helping her to learn to love books. The first book hooked her and we did not see much of her until the very last page of the final book. We're a book loving family, so we were excited when she found something that brought her the joy of reading. She is now reading the Molly books, and Grandma has a secret stash of other American Girl sets awaiting their turn to be loved."
5,One of the best!,"I recommend these lovely books even if you aren't interested in the dolls. They are directed more towards girls, but I am sure young boys would also enjoy the story line. A lot of good lessons and values taught here on the struggles of early pioneer life that we can still apply today."
4,A nice bonus,"As my daughter wanted the full set of books, it was nice to have the box be a game as a little ""bonus"". However, you do lose a little bit of the sturdiness of a regular box. And I was disppointed that the instructions did not fit neatly into the pocket (for the markers/collectibles)."
1,Brad Dutz Videos on DVD,I got this DVD from my husband and when I saw it was the Brad Dutz VHS videos that were transfered to DVD I told him to return it!! The listing on Amazon is misleading because there is no mention of who teaches the drums. I actually owned the first VHS video Have Fun Playing Hand Drums Part 1 The Djembe and was truly disappointed. just like others who reviewed the originals on Amazon. There was little to learn from the originals since the djembes that were used were more like toys.
3,Jan making a living at playing Noah's relatives!,"Starring Lew Ayres (Noah) and Eve Plumb (Jan of Brady Bunch fame).Portraying the daughter-in-law of Noah sold into slavery prior to the flood it looked like fair skinned Jan needed some Coppertone. It should be said that Miss Plumb took another Noah ""role"" in the biblical comedy ""And God Spoke."" She played Noah's wife this time. The sons of Noah beardless? Maybe there was a mange epidemic among the young ship builders, but Lew Ayres gives a good performance."
3,Hans Brinker,I really wanted the version of this story with Danny Kaye. I still want it. But I enjoyed this version & it arrived quickly as described.
5,HANS BRINKER,very very impressed I'v looked for this for a couple years i recommend it to everyone all childern should see this
1,Tired and Dated - Yawn,"Like most of Re/Search's output, this is largely interviews with a bunch of attention hungry self-promoters that has not dated terribly well because most of the subjects were simply not that interesting. The only appeal this work retains is the unintentional humor of so many people taking their hobby so seriously because it was so ""underground"": now that you can buy ""body modification"": magazines at Safeway and Ralph's, the ""cutting-edge"" cachet is missing and what's left? Nothing much."
2,My Aunt Millie loved it,"I gave this as a gift to my Aunt Millie since she heard it was 'hip' to have a piercing and a tattoo. I thought the book was poorly laid out and not colorful like the cover, but she that it was a 'groovy.' (her words)"
1,Bad Company to do business with,"Bad Company to do business with. They go by Haus of Blankets, Gravity Trading and Solaron but it is the same company.... Review Title says it all."
2,Electric Guitar Practice Amplifier,"The male connector on the unit would not hold the amplifier in a new Fender Telecaster. The company suggested that the female connector on the guitar was not properly adjusted. I had the female connector looked at by a professional who found it in good working order. Thus, I cannot recommend this product.Dinosaur1941"
2,New model much better value,"I used one of these little practice amps for a few month before the new, more powerful, two volume and tone level, unit with a slightly [bigger speaker?] came out. It was fine for what it did, but the new model is well worth the few bucks more it costs, so get it or one of the other higher rated amps. This one should have been closed out for around ten buck IMO."
2,Unusable sound,Can't get any clear tones. Fuzz is fun.Mostly disappointing. Spins around in thePhone receptacle
4,Great for the price,"This is a very inexpensive way to enable you to practice your electric guitar anywhere. However, you must keep the battery extremely fresh and avoid turning up the volume any more than necessary as it is easy to overload the extremely small speaker. There is no earphone plug, in case you were curious. The biggest flaw is that the switch is exposed and easy to move accidentally, meaning it will turn on in your case and you will need another battery. In fact, I have spent more on batteries than the purchase price of this device."
1,Don't bother buying this!,I bought this to use as a practice amp in my stratocaster because of the size and ease of use. I haven't been able to use it yet because it does't fit the female receiver is too big and the amplifier jack too small. :-(. So now I am looking for an adapter or ?? It is a pain.The little amp I bought works well and is light. OK just for practice in the bedroom sort of stuff....
1,Total disappointment!,"My 6 year old son received this for a birthday present after seeing it on Amazon because he loves airplanes and helicopters. We took it out of the package and followed the directions, only to have nothing happen. I called the company and they did send us a replacement and it also was a dud. My son was so disappointed! Do not waste your money on this product!"
2,Only for the experienced,"This book is not for the novice user. I know a little about programming and am barely able to stumble through the programming sections. An example is the scope of variables. I'm familiar with most variable types but not ""static"". All others are defined (public, private, dim, etc) but not static. There is mention of static but little real information.This was written when the product was in beta test and it shows. The examples seem to be of screen shots and the type size is about 4 point. Better have a magnifing glass to read. There are many typos and the explanation of a sub may not always follow the example.Both the experienced user and the novice would be better served by another book."
2,CD Doesn't Match the Book,"The CD has one example distributed over many chapters. However, there are other examples the book claims to be on the CD that just aren't there. The book needs a web site with up-to-date examples."
2,Editor needed!,"Authors know their stuff, but you'll have a hard time learning it since it looks like it was written without an editor. Typos, missing exampes, and passages repeated word for word within a few paragraphs are more than off-putting. They really hinder comprehension for someone trying to learn this material. Knowledgeable readers can probably figure out what the authors meant to say from the context of the discussion, but beginners will be completely lost. As one of the latter, I found it a complete waste of money."
3,"So many inaccuracies, would be a challenge for a beginner","There are so many inaccuracies from this book, it would definitely be a challenge for a beginner to use. The CD not containing the files used in the examples is a big problem. The missing files, errata, and full corrected chapters can be found at [...]. The authors seem to know the subject, but the editing is terrible."
3,This book would be great for a novice access user,Alot of the things I needed I found on the internet but for someone starting out in access and/or VBA you will like this book.
3,Not Recommended for Beginners,My initial review and thoughts on this book were not fair. I would say this book is a good reference for intermediate users. There are some errors/typos which those who are more familiar with Access would pick up on and correct but for the beginner it would only be frustrating.I use this book for quick reference when creating a database. Overall it is a fairly good book but could have been properly proof read before publishing. If this book were re-issued with the corrections made it would be an excellent text for all levels of Access users.
1,Beware the CD,"I tried to load the CD but Symantec rejected it because of a Trojan. Wiley says it is a false positive, but I am not about to disable my AV software because they cannot put together a proper installation package that can pass inspection by one of the most widely used Anti-Virus systems. Makes me wonder about what got into the book.Now that I have started using the book, I find that it consistently references missing files in the examples. I finally just gave up."
2,It is a book very hard to read,"I am an experienced access user and programmer. This book is boring, poorly organized, and very hard to read. I normally could learn a lot through intensive reading. However, I felt I wasted money and time on this book."
5,Great Chord Book For Left Handed Guitarists!,Finally a left handed chord book. Every chord you can think of is shown. A must have for the Left Handed Guitarist.
5,This IS real Fiestaware.,"I don't know what happened with the previous reviewer, but this is real Fiestaware--I ordered a salad plate in Plum to replace a broken one from a 5-piece place setting. We have two more Plum place settings and the plate is identical to the salad plates that came with them.It was packaged well (this seems to sometimes be a problem with multiple piece sets, but the single plate was securely cushioned in bubble wrap), and arrived in one day with Prime two-day shipping--we must be close to the distribution center.Although this is called a ""salad plate,"" we never use them for that. We mostly use them for breakfast items--they're the perfect size for a microwave hashbrown or a bagel sandwich."
3,Smaller than thought,"Good quality and good colors, purchased to match dinner plates. Product arrived very quickly. Smaller than thought the average salad plate should be."
2,Changes in Actors,"After watching the same 6 dvds over and over again, I was excited when my 22 month old pointed out this title. Finally, something new.As soon as I started watching it, I could tell that they had changed the actor that plays Barney's voice... and can't stand it... But I also noticed that they seem to have changed the actress who plays Baby Bop's voice as well...Please bring back the previous voices.... This video is almost unwatchable..As an aside, it was good to see the new children's cast... One of them made a cameo in the video ""Come over to Barney's House"" .."
2,More Recycled TV Clips!,In the past I've bought some Barney tapes and discovered that they weren't new shows at all. Sometimes they take old TV shows and put them in new boxes to sell. I try to avoid buying these tapes but sometimes the packaging will fool you. This is what they have done again. The box does not say that this is a collection of recycled clips from the free Public television series but that's all it is. My sons quickly became bored and walked away. Save your money and just tape these episodes off the TV if you want them.
2,Where oh where has my old Barney gone?,"It appears someone decided to fire Bob West, the voice of Barney for the last ten years. The new Barney voice is irritating, with an actor trying to hard to recreate what came naturally to West. To bad, because this could have been a good DVD. As it is, this DVD ia a disappointment."
2,New Barney voice is awful!,"I know there have been a few different voices for Barney since the original retired and while sometimes you can hear a subtle difference, this one is *awful*. At times he sounds almost as if he is talking normally and other times it's so exaggerated he just sounds bad. Even my 2 1/2 year old noticed the change. Stick w/ the earlier releases, this new guy isn't cutting it."
2,Completely agree,"I totally agree with what a previous viewer stated about the new Barney voice. I loved Barney when I was younger ... I used to be a memeber of the fan club - I've got the t-shirts, photos and I have even begun to collect the original videos so when I have kids they can watch them. I do not enjoy the new voice of Barney. He is trying too hard to sound the same and it sounds awful."
4,RaRaRa Rocket launcher!,"This is a fun game, the load times are not as bad as people make it out to be. The only complaint I have is when it starts to lag when you have too many objects on the screen. I mean seriously, this is an arcade game that takes about the same computing power to run a basic cellphone. There should be no lag. Other than that the unlockable game content is nice for replay value. ARRRGH!"
5,Non-Stop Addictive Fun,"Arcade perfect port of all 7 Metal Slug games. The action, music, graphics, enemies are so engaging and intense, that the game play is heavenly. Forget the halfa.. Wii version.If you enjoyed Metal Slug for Neo Geo, the PSP is the perfect choice. The only problem encountered is when wanting to continue. You need to go back to the Main Menu, which takes a bit of time. But, the game play has no slow down.A Must Have!!!"
2,load times ruin fun,The PSP version of this game has the worst load times. It takes forever just to turn the game on. The interuptions ruin the game experience and make it frustrating instead of fun.
5,Digital Download is the way to go.,"If you purchase this game via the PSN store there is nearly zero load time waiting, I don't think I've ran in to a single loading screen that lasted more than 5 seconds. Avoid the slow UMD version (plus you could then put this on your PS Vita to)All of these metal slug games in this collection are uncensored they are NOT the bad US censoring ""bleed white, missing some death animation"" copies. Not only that but you can unlock content for your PSP and PS3 such as background themes.highly recommend the download to any Metal slug fan with a PSP."
1,no focus,I nor any of my friends can get this scope to focus. The paralux setting has to be on infinity for it to even come close to clear at any distance
4,Wooden Castles,"While the price is undoubtedly high for a 50 min. documentary, it is very hard to find anything about timber castles. As anyone who loves history will know, most programs on castles spend the majority of their time on the idiocy of ""knights in shining armor"" and dungeons. This one does not!It begins with a fairly simple explaination of the beginning of castles (quite rudimentary to any but a beginner), but then progresses to useful information of timber castles, their construction, being replaced by stone ones, an even being painted to look as if they were stone.As I said, very expensive for a 50 min. show, but still worth it to those who love the history of castles and want something beyond the usual dreck that is offered."
1,Misleading Ad and Description,I was disappointed with the product - a really ugly top. They need to fix this misleading ad and show the actual product they are selling.
5,Excellent Information,"No hype, no drama, no preaching. Just ""this is how it is"". Pregnancy from a clinical point of view. I love that at each week, the book outlines what is happening to you and what is happening to your baby (or babies). There is information on most topics needed for pregnancy, including managing pregnancies when you have certain pre-existing medical conditions. Information is relevant for both mothers and fathers, and there is a section specifically for the new dads. I like the charts at the end of each section covering the various weeks that outline when to call a doctor for what symptom. Also, I've enjoyed the images they have of the babies each few weeks that say ""X percent of actual size"" so you can get a feel for how your child is progressing from one period to the next."
5,Very informative,"Terrific for medical questions, diet suggestions, any concerns while you're pregnant. Also the Mayo Clinic in the title instills a sense of confidence that the information will be accurate and well-researched. Highly recommend this book to expectant mothers and their families."
5,Informative,"The best part of this book is the picture each week showing the actual size of the fetus. Lots of great info is covered in a quick to read, get to the point fashion. It's become my go to guide for all of my questions and worries."
2,Not all that enlightening,"I bought this book because I had heard that ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" edition 10 million wasn't the best book on the market. I can say this one isn't really either. I didn't find it to be all that helpful. I don't know what I was looking for but this just wasn't it."
2,Doesn't Answer Why,"After reading the reviews on this page I had high hopes for this book. It has been a great source of information about how your baby is developing week by week.However, it is severely lacking the answer to one simple question: why? As in, your doctor may recommend you avoid this or that, here's the reason. Instead, the book asks you to simply accept the answer and in doing so underestimates the reader's intelligence.Further the index is lacking, expecting the reader to look up things such as ""ectopic pregnancy"" rather than ""tubal pregnancy"". I was disappointed that I first had to google my question before being able to read the answer in my book.I expected more from the Mayo Clinic."
3,Ok book but very heavy,"The book is informative and has sections for after giving birth (newborn care, etc) but since the pages are of the glossy type and the book is quite thick, it is really heavy and for pregnant women, holding this up for a while strains your wrists/arms and resting it on your belly is a no-no too coz of it weight...."
2,nothing special,A very plain and medical book on the basics. I'd recommend Spiritual Midwifery or Ina May's guide to Childbirth for the real beauty and workings of normal pregnancy and birth.
5,Excellent service,I received this book very quickly and in perfect condition. Happy to do business w/ you!
5,Good information,This book gives a good month by month prognosis of what you should expect during the course of your pregnancy. It is pretty realistic and a very good source of information.
4,Wonderful,"I got this book along with the ""What to Expect"" book (which was actually a gift). I appreciated having both because they are written from a different perspective. This book is obviously written by medical professionals and sounds and feels like it. I appreciated it because when reading it I felt like I could completely trust the information that was in it. I appreciated having the ""What to expect"" book as well because it had a more conversational approach."
4,Good info on pregnancy,This book provides great information about pregnancy. It is worth the purchase especially for first-time mothers. Only problem is that I received this book so late. Not sure why the delay.
5,Very Informative (in an un-itimidating way),"Provides alot of information, I'm a first time mom-to-be & found it very easy to understand. They don't use big words (w/o explaining them) & the monthly/weekly layout is great!"
4,Great Book...,Very helpful and insightful. Of course this is a exciting and scary time for woman but this book really helps you feel comfortable. I highly recommend it.
5,Great resource!,"This is a great, factual book written by Doctors. Very straight forward and helpful. This is a much better book than What To Expect When You're Expecting!"
5,Absolutely love this book,"Informative without being overwhelming. Easy to read. Answered every question I had during my pregnant. Best book out there by far! 100x better than ""What to Expect.."""
4,Good reference guide,"Yes you can probably find a lot of the info in this book online. But it's great to have a reference guide handy. I like that it's written by doctors (who are also mothers). It describes the physiology of what's happening to you each month so you understand why suddenly you've got non-stop massive heartburn and can't stop burping and are always so tired the tears start flowing like a fussy toddler... among the list of many other joys of going through pregnancy. The matrix chart of things possible issues/warning signs to look out for and if/when to tell the doctor is helpful... especially if you're a newbie and start reading horror stories about the results of every little concerning thing that can happen...The list of dos and don'ts is basic and down-to-earth, and based primarily on known causes of complications and recommendations generally relied on by mainstream medicine. So you're not freaking out that anything and everything will kill, stunt, or disfigure your baby..."
4,Would have liked more insight,Very good book but doesn't answer many questions I have about other issues than day to day. Would like more detail on what is happening with the mothers body during each week. Would have liked remedies for morning sickness and other discomforts. I had to either ask my doctor or search online and ask other women for the answers I needed.
5,THE best!,"Can't go wrong with all these positive reviews - this book is THE BEST out there, especially for first time pregnancies. It is a wealth of information and I can't tell you how many times my wife has read about her week in pregnancy and said, ""Oh I've felt that""! .. It is also great to reference if something doesn't feel right - to know whether it is ""normal"" or not during pregnancy.I can't say enough about this book - this is THE book to get, especially for first time soon-to-be parents."
5,"Great, comprehensive pregnancy guide","I often refer to the Mayo Clinic online for health info, so I was excited to see they had a pregnancy book. I have 3 other pregnancy books that I received as gifts and I have only opened them once or twice. The Mayo Clinic book is really all you need. It has week by week info including what's going on with the baby as well as mom. It is divided into sections for easy reference and is by far the most complete and easy to read book I've seen. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
5,Excellent Book,I am in my 12th week and have found this book to be an excellent resource. It gives just enough information in an organized manner. It's straightforward and to the point without making you any more nervous than you already are.
4,Great guide,"This book is not the most exciting read, but it provides a lot of useful information. It's also a great reference."
5,Finally an Excellent source of Information!,"This book is well written, easy to read, has sections for my husband which are fantastic for both of us!It is not common sense blather, it is real life information that is broken down so that it is applicable.This is a first pregnancy for both of us, and this book has been a wonderful support, for both of us."
5,This is the book to get!,"During my last pregnancy, I bought ""What To Expect When You're Expecting,"" but lent it to a friend afterwards. So, now, for this pregnancy I bought this book. I like this one much better! It is well-organized, easy to reference, and has consistent categories month-by-month. I would definitely recommend this as the book to get!!!"
4,Very useful pregnancy reference book,"This is a very factual and accurate pregnancy reference book -- the kind of book you want to turn to if you have a specific medical question or concern. It is similar in style to The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby by John Sussman and Ann Douglas and Conception, Pregnancy, and Birth by Miriam Stoppard. The tone is slightly more medical than the other two books, but the book is still highly readable and will be welcomed as a gift by many expectant couples."
1,Waste of Money!!!,"I thought that since this book was from the Mayo clinic, it would be the best book that I could buy. It was a waste of money. Very boring and nothing special to read. You can spend less money and buy a better more informative book. I bought this book when I was 8wks pregnant and I only looked at it a few times. It still looks brand new!!"
2,Used least among all my other pregnancy books,"I have 5-6 pregnancy books and i picked chapters to read during my pregnancy. for some reason, this one is the one I read the least. I even forget why because I read so little of it!"
3,"A good book, but mostly available free from the mayo website","Buy it if you want, it's a good reference but the mayo clinic also has a great free website you can use."
5,Very informative,This was my main resource book throughout my entire pregnancy and I highly recommend it.
5,Lots of Info,I like the decision making section in the back and the week by week illustrations for the pregnancy. Thanks Mayo Clinic.
5,Excellent,"Book gives excellent understanding of different stages of pregnancy,details regarding same and what to expect.They also have chapters on breast feeding etc."
5,excellent on my kindle,"I purchased this guide on my kindle, and I'm very happy with it. It has a lot of excellent information for while your pregnant, and after baby comes home as well. I really enjoyed reading this book, it had a lot of helpful tips."
4,"Execllent Content, images and charts hard to view","I bought this for my Kindle, but wish I had bought the paper version. There are a lot of charts with information that are almost impossible to read because you can't zoom into images.The content of the text is execllent - very straight forward, not dumbed down. Information is clear and organized in exactly the order that I wanted/ needed it to be based on the questions I had. Perfect for a new mom!"
4,Helpful guide to pregnancy,"So far, so good. My husband and I are currently trying to conceive, the book has been helpful with tips on tracking fertility/ ovulation. A bit outdated, but pregnancy tips seem to always change."
2,I hate this book,"I hate this book. Perhaps it is just because I am a scientist by training, but I find this book to be so watered-down and lacking in detail that it is insulting to my intelligence. If you are interested in just the minimum basics and don't ask ""why?"" all that much, this book might be for you. But to be honest, there is about the same amount of information contained in my free iphone app, so even then you may as well save the money.It glosses over major subjects and doesn't even include a lot of more modern information about newer diagnostic tests, for example. I'd pass on this book altogether, you can get better information just by googling."
5,Wonderful Pregnancy Reference,"This book is well-organized and is full of practical MEDICAL advice, with handy decision guides for every month. I stress the word ""medical"" because there is just too much junk out there about pregnancy. This book is the real deal. I strongly recommend this book over the popular ""What to Expect..."" book."
5,The Only Pregnancy book you need!,I bought this book based on the reviews on Amazon. This book is very reliable and straight to the point. Many of my questions were answered in this book and every advise in this book is the same as what my OB would advise. I would recommend this book to any pregnant woman. If you have this book you wont need any of the other books out there.
5,Fabulous and Informative!,"I got this book when I was pregnant with my daughter. I also got Your Pregnancy Week By Week. Both were fabulous. I could read about what was going on and understand, with out the fear of What to expect, which I thought was a crappy book. I have talked with many friends and they too were frieghtened by what to expect, so I loaned out this book, and information without the fear. It is easy to understand, easy to find answers, and reassuring. Definitely worth your money! This is one that I want back for my second pregnancy!!"
5,Very Helpful Reference Guide!,"As a writer, I often find myself writing on medical topics. The Mayo Clinic is one of the few reliable resources I can trust. So when I saw they had a book on pregnancy, I was over the moon! This book is a fantastic reference guide about the growth and development of a baby. The book goes into great detail on what symptoms you can expect throughout your pregnancy, which I thought was most helpful in assuaging any fears or concerns."
4,Love this book,"This book is easily the best pregnancy book i have read. user friendly layout, full of information for every stage and gives perspecives that I haven't found in other books."
4,Recommended resource for new parents,"As first-time parents, we wanted a handy reference for what to expect in pregnancy. My mother-in-law, a retired nurse, checked out several books at the library and recommended this one. It is well organized and has been useful so far."
4,Wish I had bought paperback.,"I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 because I bought it in the Kindle format. All the information in the book is wonderful and easy to read and understand. It is not condescending or frightening, but honest and informative. While I love reading on my Kindle, for this book I find myself wishing I could flip through the pages to the decision guides, for example. It is the type of book I would normally shuffle through and look quickly between pages to compare different facts and references, but I find that harder to do on the Kindle. I also find that even if I change the size of the font on the Kindle the different charts and graphs in the book do not change size, which makes them more difficult to read. I am completely satisfied with the book, though not completely satisfied with the Kindle format in this particular case. If I could go back I would buy this book in paperback format and leave the Kindle to my novels."
3,"info is there, but dissapointed","The Glossary (which is my quick find resource) lacks. It only has medical pregnancy terms, so if you wanted to look up something specific which is likely IN the book you will have to flip through the pages. Ok buy, had better pregnancy books last time around."
4,Good balance of clinical and practical for pregnancy advice.,"I bought this for my second pregnancy as sort of a refresher (had been 6 years since my first pregnancy) and reference guide and it served this purpose well. It's not something you would read cover to cover, but I liked it for that reason. I could look up specific questions or issues I wanted to read about, and then also once/week could read the section on what to expect for that week of gestation. I had other books like The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy for fun, lighter reading on what to expect my first time around. By the second time, I needed something more to the point on what to expect and look out for for each trimester and each week. I would recommend this book to any expecting mother."
4,Very helpful and thorough!,"A very helpful book, answers all your questions and even the ones you never thought of.Highly recommended for all the first-time mommies."
3,Glosses over everything,"This book discusses a ton of topics and goes beyond pregnancy into caring for a newborn, breastfeeding, etc. Because it covers so many topics, it just glosses over everything. If you need basic information, it may be helpful. But if you want a comprehensive book that covers just pregnancy, look somewhere else."
5,Solid,"I couldn't be happier with the straightforward approach used by the authors. I would have to say that the tone is more reassuring than alarmist, which is great for this first timer. While What to Expect does have a more ""this is your girlfriend offering advice"" tone to to it, it also tends toward alarmist tendencies and it's clear that the authors are subject to birthing/parenting trends which Mayo Clinic avoids for sound scientific reasons. If it isn't scientifically proven, take it with a grain of salt.That said, the de-emphasis on home-birthing may be off-putting for those serious about that option. It might have been more helpful to suggest courses of action, additional training for attendant fathers and so on as parents who are insistent upon home birth should be aware of and provided with necessary tools rather than simply told, ""not a good idea"". Besides, anything can happen, even to a hospital bound couple.Overall, a great handbook."
4,Great,"Lots of information, but not as encouraging as it gives a lot of facts and info about complication and issues that you can run into. Doesn't discuss emotions or feelings that might be experienced to normalize individual experiences. Gives plenty of info on physical experiences and baby issues associated with pregnancy."
5,great product,"Fast shipment, and great quality, and great price!Would buy from this seller again.Product was shipped in a timely fashion."
5,Good Read,"Really good informative book - very helpful. Easy to understand. Great section in the back of everything listed in alphabetical order, so it's easy to quick find an answer to a question or worry I was having."
5,Fabulous book!,"I use this book as my main ""textbook"" for teaching my child development class. It's not a textbook at all but it is so useful with information on any subject. I have recently started TTC and I use all the information that I teach the kids to now teach myself! I was a little hesitant this year using this book since it was written in 2004 but, just yesterday, I saw they came out with another edition that was rewritten in May of 2011 and so I bought it to use this year. Great reference guide!"
1,Buy Burn Baby Burn Instead!,"This is the worst EHC release! The recording is grainy and unbalanced. Gone, is the ironic lyrics and the sense of humor that make EHC stand out from the rest of the ""Evil"" bands. Save your money or buy Burn Baby Burn!"
3,They've been so much better,"When this disc finally came out I bought it right away, hoping for a return to the sound of Burn, Baby, Burn and Kiss the Goat. Unfortunately, I found it lacking in respect to those albums. On the plus side, it did try to return to that sound, away from the sound of Calling Dr. Luv (which itself contained some very good tracks). I like the direction that they are trying to go, and the next album may be great. This one just isn't as good.That is not to say that it is a bad album. The darkness is there, the harshness is there, and the powerful lyrics are there. They just don't combine as well as they did on the first two albums mentioned above. This is a good disc to throw in with some others on shuffle, but it's hard to take straight through.I'm still hoping that it will grow on me with more listenings. If you don't own any EHC, get Kiss the Goat or Burn, Baby, Burn. If you have all the rest, don't avoid this."
2,"The music has ""gone to Hell""","This latest edition in the Hellfire series is going to leave some fans asking ""why?"" Why.. did these guys turn away from the 60's Satanic-Disco Dark-Wave grooooove that made this band stand out from the crowd. Why.. are they sounding like another rock/metal band? Why.. is everything sounding so serious? These guys had put the ""fun"" back in Satanism, but now are possibly showing signs of weakness..or should I say selling out? The disk does contain some great music, but I don't think it will go over too well with the die-hard fans. Remember what happened to Thrill Kill Kult?"
5,The best little Guide Ever!,"This is not a book. It is a 4 page ""cheat sheet"". I learned HTML from a book and then also purchased this BarChart. I use the bar chart often when I hand code or fix HTML coding. I highly recommend it!"
3,basic finance,I used this book for a class and it had the basics of what I needed to understand the basics of finance so I think this is good for someone who needs basic understanding.
1,Waste Of Time,"This is one of those books that expects that you have some knowledge of the material already, and if you do its really nothing new. The examples lack substance. Its a learn everything in ""50 Minutes"" bbok (Which I didn't notice that until I received it in the top right hand corner). To anyone who is learning this the first time, stay away and go with the other reader's recommendations because you are going to have to relearn this again, and this this stuff is just to dry for that to happen..."
3,Just Okay...,"After reading the reviews on this cd I was hoping it would be a little better than it is. I purchased this cd to listen to during the day while at home hoping for relaxing, fun & tranquil music. My best description after giving it a few listens is.. ""It's Just Okay""."
4,Review of Rocks and Minerals Bulletin Board,Great bulletin board set for teachers. Durable material and nice and big for students to see.
1,So out of date,I should have check the copyright date. This book is so out of date most of the papers discussed are no longer made and the same goes for enlargers.Was not worth the price.
4,"Not grand, but good none the less","I'll start by saying that this did not follow Bronte's classic extremely well, having cut out the latter part of the book, but it does suffice for what is there. Though with just the CD, and none of the dialogue that would have come between songs, it is a bit difficult to follow the story. The vocal talents, however, I feel were very exceptional. Dave Willetts made a dark and brooding Heathcliff, and Lesley Garrett captured the essence of Cathy quite well. Not all of the songs were grand, but it had some gems none the less, and did tell a descent story for what was there. If you're seeking a musical CD that tells the full story I would not suggest this one, for it seems parts are missing without the dialogue, but if you just enjoy theatre music, or even the classic novel, I would suggest giving this one a chance."
4,Beautiful music,"The music is beautiful, especially the opening Prelude. The song ""I Belong to the Earth"" is very lovely. I would definitely recommend this CD!"
3,Interesting musical for a literary classic,"Conventional from a musical viewpoint, but interesting for being the adaptation of a popular literary classic. It has some attractive tunes and the voices are fine. However, as a whole, it never gets too high. For the ones interested in musicals AND literature as well, it becomes a must."
3,Adequate documentary lacking Irish spirit,"Certainly this hour-long documentary covers the basic facts of several Irish authors' lives, and there are beautiful images of Ireland, especially Dublin, throughout, but it lacks the essential joy and spirit of some of the very writers it profiles. It feels more like the kind of documentary your school teachers forced you to endure. There are no interviews with scholars, relatives, or even people of local color.My hunch is the transfer is from VHS that was recorded from a film copy -- the audio is raspy and the images are a bit muddy and full of artifacts.It's a decent documentary, but not particularly memorable."
3,Highs and Lows,"Colin is definately at his best when singing and playing the acoustic guitar with no backing. His distinctive voice and acoustic guitar is the perfect blend to provide ""soul"" to his songs. When you add additional instruments, the songs sound dated and bland."
3,Decent acoustic,"Good versions of ""Who can it be now?"" and ""Over Kill"" ... other than that, not too much new to the table ..."
4,Reunion with a lost friend,"Recently, I have heard Mr. Hay on ""Scrubs"" and the Steve Dahl radio show and it led me to this album. When I was 13 I discovered the pop melodies of Men At Work and now in my 30's I rediscover the real lyrics of those songs set to a new tempo and arrangement. Bittersweet...playful and thouroughly enjoyable. I have yet to find a track on the disc that I don't at some point play over and over again. He embraces his pasts songs and its led me to appreciate the new work. I would like to see Colin Hay more receive success and some recognition a album like this deserves."
5,Amazing solo album,"I feel sorry for anyone who passes this CD up only because Hay was in what many wrongfully label an 80's novelty band. This cd clearly shows Hay's musical genius. There's so much to appreciate on this album, from the warm sounding guitars, to Hay's John Mayeresque voice (which should be called John Mayer's Colin Hayesque voice) to some of the cds witty/funny lines (Where a man can still be free/ or a woman if you are one). THere's no reason for you to not buy two, maybe three copies of 'Man at Work."""
3,"Not as good as ""Going Somewhere""","There's something I just don't like about this CD. I really loved Going Somewhere and was expecting more like it but turns out this is just re-recorded Men At Work songs and a couple rarities.If you're just getting into Colin Hay, I recommend you start with ""Going Somewhere"", and only get this if you're a hardcore fan of Men at Work."
4,Strong performance,"A very good cd...why isn't Colin's stuff getting mainstream airplay?...if any airplay at all? ""Storm In My Heart"" is an excellent song that should be getting airplay on adult contemporary stations at least. The stripped down versions of ""Down Under"" and ""Who Can It Be Now?"" are great. ""It's a Mistake"" is a bit overdone and doesn't sound that well-produced. ""Waiting For My Real Life To Begin"" and ""Love Is Innocent"" are also very good songs. Colin Hay plays many of these songs in concert on his current tour. I saw him in Cleveland....great concert. Check him out if he comes to your city."
4,Real life to begin,"This cd reflects the old and the new. You'll hear some of the music that made Men at work a big hit in the past. You also can hear the wonderful direction Mr. Hay has taken as he continues his journey as a writer of touching lovely songs. The song ""Waiting for my real life to begin"" is such a treat. Don't deprive yourself of the chance to sing along. I also HIGHLY recommend seeing Colin Hay in concert if you have the chance. He's funny and the music it even more moving when you hear the story behind the song."
3,Partially Satisfied,"I purchased two copies of The Untold Story. We were wanting to use this in a Bible Study with others. One of the copies was fine and the other was outdated with different wording, page numbers etc. Interesting that the publication date was the same for both books.We paid basically the same price for both. It is useable but conflicting."
2,Green Machine,"I agree with LMS ""Book worm"" who said: ""I was very disappointed by this book. I expected a lot more after reading ""Pagan Christianity"" ""Reimagining Church"" and the many positive reviews on this site. ... In my opinion, this is not one of Viola's strongest works. This book is okay. But in my opinion, there's nothing here that's earth shattering. My advice would be to skip this book and pick up a copy of ""Pagan Christianity"" instead. ... In my opinion, this is not one of Viola's strongest works. ... But in my opinion, there's nothing here that's earth shattering. My advice would be to skip this book and pick up a copy of ""Pagan Christianity"" instead."""
3,clever ideas but missing some practical information,"Lots of clever ideas for small water gardens, as well as helpful general information on appropriate plants, fish, etc. However, it would have been nice if the author had provided a list of suppliers, at least for the more esoteric items. I too would like to make a shishi-odoshi fountain, but haven't the first idea where to buy the shishi-odoshi that is the first item on the list of project supplies (!). Also, while each of the finished projects is nicely photographed it would have been a great help if there were more photographs or illustrations of more of the projects in the construction stage."
2,Quick and Easy Container Water Gardening,"I was so excited to receive the book because I wanted to learn how to create wonderful water garden features. I ordered the book specifically to learn how to make the shishi-odoshi water feature. I was so disappointed to find that the book, which has great pictures,has very little information on how to do any of the pictured features. The book falls far short of my expectations. If I saw it in a book store, I would not buy it. It is a real disappointment that a noted horticulturalist, having the knowledge to help all of us novices, decidedly omits key information. This is not a quick and easy how to do book on water gardening. I can do much better watching Home and Garden Television. I wish I had my money back!"
5,Beautiful book,"I bought this book on the recommendation of the instructor of a course given at the New York Botanical Gardens. The book is so exquisite that I keep it within arm's reach at all times. Besides its beauty, the directory of plants, information on hardiness zones, and the section on things you need to know give invaluable practical information. With this knowledge, I have been able to keep a small container water garden going strong for over a year, even during last winter's snowstorms."
3,Soul of Freddie Hughes,"What great vocals, what great songs,what a great disappointment...I expected something real,something genetic like Charles Walkers 'Leaving This Old Town'. Freddie Hughes could have done it if it hadn't been for 'digital XFER'and 'digital imaging'.One person performs all instruments[apart from two track's].Well played as they are,it still sounds like a thin tinny topy english eighties production.I'd love to hear it redone with a real band and a couple more vocal tracks to make up for the filler instrumentals.Reluctantly I give this album four out ten because it could have been so good with some real human input instead of one person with 'I.T' skills."
3,Worked great...died after seven months,They were nice before their untimely death. I am hard on headphones due the fact that I always trip on them in my cube. These ones did not withstand the beating.
3,Bass went out,"I have been using these phones for about a month with hardcore rap beats with extreme bass. I turn the volume up pretty loud, and eventually the bass booster inside burned out, and now my recordings and beats are distorted"
5,Classic Jesse,This collection of music is Jesse's best. You will not be disappointed by this cd. It's a must have for all the fans of the Minneapolis sound.
2,"Uh, not so much","Maybe I grew up since the 80's, but this is a weak CD. Very little that is listenable at all, let alone something that would go into heavy rotation.I can't believe I ever thought this was cool. One decent cut on the entire album. Uninspired instrumentals and tone deaf singing. Purple Rain??? How about Nurple Pain."
1,:-(,"I received the product in its time. but the problem that was not what I expected, waiting in black, not blue as I arrived"
3,Worth seeing,"No diggity, Bushies and GOP tactics are pretty shady, and they continue through to today. (See Bob Herbert's 8/16/04 ""Suppress the Vote"" in New York Times... potential FLA voters are being harrassed already). Still, as the DVD states, Gore asked for a recount in only four counties, not the whole state. This move gave the GOP a huge selling point: Gore only wanted Democratic counties recounted; he didn't care about ""every vote being counted."" Also, the GOP had tough folksy Jim Baker stating their case. And Gore had... uhhh... Warren Christopher, slight in his eastern pinstripes, and barely audible in too long arguments. So, if Florida is a case in point of how Gore does politics, he was quite lame. (That's not even counting Gore retracting his concession). Were and are the GOP Win At All Costs Machiavellians? Yes. Did Gore deserve to win? Not so sure. This dvd is one-sided politically, but Moveon.org is putting out some very educational stuff! Keep it up!"
5,All Concerned Voters Should Watch Unprecedented,"We feel so strongly about this documentary that we purchased several copies to donate to our local library and other organizations.Anyone concerned about democracy in the United States should watch this documentary.UNPRECEDENTED details voter fraud in Florida and the four million dollar campaign by the Florida Electoral Board to disenfranchise voters. It has won the following awards: 2002 Grand Festival Award Documentary at the Berkeley Video & Film Festival; 2002 Directors Award at the NY International Independent Film Festival; 2002 Audience Award Best Documentary at the San Francisco Independent Film Festival; 2002 ""Route 66"" Award Best Documentary Feature at the Winslow International Film Festival."
5,Unprecedented - The 2000 Presidential Election -,Unprecedented - The 2000 Presidential Election is an extrordinary dissection of the tragic 2000 Presidential Election. I have read a great deal about that election and I felt the film incorporated all the saient facts and events.
4,Right vs. Left,"Perhaps ""Viewer"" from the midwest should be reminded that those on the ""right"" politically are conservative and those on the ""left"" are liberal. Therefore, it could be argued that there was a ""left-wing"" bias in the portrayal of this documentary.By the way, this is an interesting video that raises many interesting points about the way the Republicans stole this election. This was an ugly period in partisan politics and exposed just how low conservatives will go to get their way. Of course, they learned from the dirty tricks master, Richard Nixon."
4,Dubba-Ya Bush,"How can this nation allow a person who cheated to win the presidency remain president? We all know he cheated: there is a Bush as governor in Florida! And that whole Florida recount thing, Bush going on record saying ""We will win Florida! I guarentee it"" or something like that.If Bush wins this year's presidency..."
3,"it seems obvious some of the ""reviewers"" haven't seen this",c'mon folks! don't waste my time if you haven't seen the video!
2,please read the other side of arguement,"Hello, everyone.I am an open minded person, I thought the documentary was interesting with some of the depth, But I beg people to look at what republicans did and felt and why, I have to say maybe if this film showed some more from the right side,I would maybe like it more,so please everyone read At Any cost, how al gore tried to steal florida, farenhype 9/11 or celsius 4.11. They kinda give you what the right side thinks.Just remember - between two biases . the truth is in the middle somewhere. Thank you"
1,More proaganda than documentary,"Bottom line...1. If you liked Gore, you will love it and visa versa.2. It is one-sided, plain and simple.3. Nobody considers the poor inept voter who failed to comprehend a simple ballot, or the responsibility of a voter to unsterstand at least enough English to distinguish ""GORE from BUSH"". Democrats wanted quantity, and the lack of quality also extended into the indecisive and ambiguous recount procedures that hundreds of lawyers just couldn't get right."
5,Extremely Informative,"I saw this documentary in May and was totally surprised at the information they showed. I am a Floridian who thought I knew everything about what happened in this election, but I was totally mistaken! If I had understood all that had taken place behind the scenes, I would have been even more upset at what happened. Of course, NOW, with what Bush has and is doing, I'm already more upset than then. At the time, I thought Bush might be OK since he seemed to be a nice guy, even though I voted for Gore. Now I want to get the video to show to everyone in my neighborhood who would like to see it."
4,For Math and Computer Scientists,"I agree with a lot of what the review by wiredweird said in ""Good, for the dedicated reader"". I just wanted to add that I believe that this book would be totally unreadable to all biologists that do not also have a fairly strong math or computer science background. As a computer scientist though, I found that this book was very useful because the explanations presented went beyond the frequently used buzzwords and included math/graph explanations of the techniques. While there is no code to copy from the book, I found most explanations sufficient enough that I could implement many of the techniques on my own if I wanted to."
4,"A wonderful read, much more than I bargained for","I bought the book for a lesson in golf history, but was fascinated by the ecology, history and culture of the Scottish Highlands as desribed by the author. It is also a beautifully written travelogue, poetic and mystical, and has certainly changed the way I think about golf. This book could only have been improved by the addition of photographs."
1,pretentious,"Another Messiah complex movie. Apparently all cultures of the world great and small need constant saving from tyranny and injustice by the Benevolent intervention of a Caucasian man. Weak plot, poor dialogue and pathetic fight choreography. Don't Bother"
2,Glad I didn't pay to see it.,"Had potential, but the fighting scenes were weak and the ending was corny. Typical you killed my father revenge kung fu flick, but the action was only about half as good as your typical Shaw Brothers movie. This movie is on about the same level as Dragonball Evolution. I've seen much worse. If you have nothing to do on a Saturday afternoon and feel like wasting 90 minutes, I guess watching this movie is better than watching grass grow."
3,Totally hip hop!,This cd is ok it's got good song alot of different mixture of both! Rap and Hip Hop!!! Yes I would recommend thisCd to friends and family!!! KC
3,It's OK....I guess,"i agree with the person who wanted a cd w/ clean hip hop songs on it...as a hip hop dancer i really like hip hop but it's very hard to find clean songs...SO! i would like to recommend the cd labled ""We are Hip Hope"" and if u don't mind hearing christian lyrics (why should you?!) then this is a great cd it has artists like KJ-52 and Grits on it that provide that clean hip hop!!"
3,3.5- its okayyyyyy,"[...]best- gossip folks, in da wind, so fesh so clean, etc.bad- rock the party, what you got, what about us, tell me""im just so freash, so clean (so freash and so clean)""-Outkast (F/Sleepy Brown)- So Fresh, So Clean[...]go get all the g-unit/shady/aftermath cds toooooooooooo"
3,Good Gift,"I purchased this CD for my older sister. Although I find the music to be simple and kind of dull, she liked it and said it brought back old memories."
4,"Gary Lewis & the Playboys, greatest hits","Having heard many hits on the oldies station, I was glad to see this album come up on sale. It is an inexpensive way to collect some of the music from before ""my time"" of buying current radio play. The quality of the sound is good. The songs from that era were quite short, so the album is over before you know it. I think they could have put a few more songs on it. However, so many of the songs are hits you will enjoy, that it is a bargain. It is hard to justify buying an entire album for one or two songs, but I am glad to have all the songs on this one."
5,"Helen Kane: Gone, but not forgotten","Helen Kane was an extremely talented singer from the 20's who is best known for inspiring the creation of ""Betty Boop"" and for her rendition of ""I Wanna Be Loved By You"", which opens this collection. Upon further listening, you'll latch on to many of Miss Kane's nuances that made her truly stand apart from all the other singers of the day. Her phrasing is impeccable and her comic timing is precise. Add some great backing musicians and you have a thoroughly enjoyable collection.To the best of my knowledge this is the only CD that contains her recordings from the 50's as well. Although they are much more produced than the 20's recordings (technology had come a long way), they still capture that fun/silly atmosphere and deliver.Give it a listen -- Cyndi Lauper did (Cyndi covered ""He's So Unusual"" on her 1984 debut LP, and mimicked Helen Kane throughout that LP's closing track ""Yeah Yeah"") -- and look where it got Cyndi!!Highly recommeded."
1,True Hauntings of All of Her Friends,"Ok. This book COULD be interesting to some. However, I found it to be pretty much the SAME story again and again.A friend she knew (or friend of a friend)...Have heard of her or her group....(you know how popular paranormal groups are - especially 60 years ago)All these friends are psyhic (some not knowing it)...All the spirits are talked to, need convincing, go into the light after apologizing to the friend....I just find it really hard to believe any of these stories when they are all SO much the same.Plus a gentlemen wrote in another review of this book that the names have been changed and cannot be researched.I bought this book to get a better view of why ghosts haunt. I felt like she was asking a lot of whys and telling a lot of very short stories that didn't answer any question. I was very disappointed."
5,great book,this is a very good book well written. if you like to read about the paranormal this is a good book for you. i recomend it.
4,Some interesting stories in here!,The author at least keeps your interest and there are some pretty good stories in here. I would reccomend this one.
5,Organization Made Easy,"The book is easy to read and make use of in everyday life for relieving clutter and learning how to remove it from your life. It is divided into sections that coordinate with the home. I found the book very enlightening and gave me some great ""new"" ideas for cleaning up the clutter in my life. Overall: A very good book for both unorganized and the organized alike."
1,didn't like this book,I thought this book was not very practical or informative. It wasn't really what I ordered. It was a replacement.
2,ok if you don't have many problems,"I bought this book at the recommendation of my favorite magazine...Good thing I used a gift certificate and didn't waste my own money. I gave it 2 stars, but maybe it's worth 2.5 stars-just for the effort. It does have some good ideas, but for the people like me, who love to organize but just don't have the space, it's not that useful. I was expecting more ideas about how to use the space I have. Unfortunately, I usually have better and more creative ideas than the author. Another major ""-"" is that the book talks a lot about throwing stuff away; well, what I have to say to that is that I periodically do that anyway, and I still am space challenged. That's not the solution to every problem!"
3,"Beautiful design, but that is it.","Really, this should be called ""Organization for Dummies"". It is a beautiful book, and of course I love that, but the information is VERY basic. Best to flip through at the bookstore and get something with more meat. We can all figure out how to put cotton balls in a jar. Too bad."
2,"Very pretty book, some ideas but not that good","""The Home Organizing Workbook"" by Meryl Starr is the type of book that is design to catch the reader attention of the shelve. But, once the reader takes a close look at it. The reader begins to realize that while it has some useful information there are better organizing books on the market. If you are interesting reading it, just check it out, and save your money."

5,Excellent Study Guide,Read the book for two weeks straight. Passed the exam with no problem. This is a must get for anyone looking to get A+ Certification.
3,Came missing part of the book,"The dictionary looked great, but it was missing the last few letters of the alphabet and all of the appenixes (appendices?). If you order, check to be sure the whole book is there! Returned this one."
3,Time to call time?,"Starnino doesn't like Canadian poetry very much, does he? I'm not saying he's wrong, mind - he hates Anne Carson with a vengeance, but somebody has to - but I'd like to know what (if any) Canadian poets the current young guns (Karen Solie, Michael Lista, quirky Gabe Foreman, say) turned to for inspiration when they were growing up. Can there be said to be a Canadian poetic tradition at all - I mean one worth preserving - or should we just trash the lot and say Canadians write poetry in the modern anglophone manner (stemming from Eliot, say), period?Alternatively - I'll bet all French Canadians are exposed to the poetry of the mother country, and so they should be - make the blighters ALL learn French!"
2,Not a fan,You can achieve better results using your oven. Tried making jerky treats for the dogs a couple of times - from chicken breast and no matter what I tried - the chicken just came out dry and brittle. Could be it just takes some getting used to - but I found using the oven at the lowest setting worked much better.
1,This product use a plastic the may leach toxins,"Nesco American Harvest FD-61WHC Snackmaster Express Food Dehydrator All-In-One Kit with Jerky GunThis product uses #7 plastic shelving in the area subject to heating. There is controversy that this type of plastic may leach chemicals when heated. When I discovered this, I returned it."
1,what a joke,"It took forever to dry some thinly sliced apples (7 hours +) and it looks and feels extremely cheap. Made completely out of plastic. I was laughing, when i saw the ""jerky gun"", looked like a toy from the dollar tree (pretty much the whole thing could have been from the dollar tree..).I returned it after 1 day and i will keep drying my stuff in the oven, faster and most of all cheaper.This thing is a joke.."
2,meets my needs,"great value for the price. Have dried jerky, fruit and fruit leathers. Fast, easy and fun. Looking forward to drying tomatoes and other bounty from my garden this year. Cleans easily and drying times are quite fast. This is a great addition to my kitchen and the jerky gun is a handy and useful tool, in fact I prefer the jerky made with the gun as being easier to chew and flavor."
4,One of the most useful appliances,"This is my first dehydrator and I'm very happy how it turned out. If you're looking into making raw recipes or simply dehydrating foods for long backpacking trips, I'd highly recommend this one! The only thing you'd have to do is learn how to gauge the temperature knob and figure out how crispy, cooked, maleable, etc you'd want your product to be."
4,Great Gift,new in box with instructions for use. I like that it came with the jerky attachment. I think it would be a great gift.
4,Nesco American Harvest FD-61WHC Snackmaster Express Food Dehydrator All-In-One Kit with Jerky Gun,It was fun to experiment with different foods. The heating element is the lid which makes the lid rather heavy. Have not tried the jerky gun yet.
4,Easy to use,Easy to use. Easy to clean. We love drying apples and making turkey jerky in this product. Now that I'm a stay at home mom I hope to find many other uses.
5,Works Great!,"This did everything I wanted it to do. The jerky gun worked flawlessly. It was actually easier than I anticipated. I love the dehydrator. It comes with everything you need. I was impressed. After reading about drying certain items I'm glad I purchased this one because it let's you set the temperature. If you are going to buy a dyhydrator, buy this one."
2,Bought 2 of these and both died after use,"I have purchased 2 of these nesco dehydrators before. Now my 2nd one died just like the first, ending up too hot to touch on the lowest setting and a possible fire hazard. I wish there was another brand of dehydrator of the stackable tray type that was made in America, because these are Chinese pieces of crap."
4,Great dehydrator,"I love this dehydrator and use it a lot more than I thought I would (Beef jerky makes a GREAT gift). It works fantastic and I love that I can set the heat, however The plastic does stain very easy and there is no way to get the stains out anymore:-( Guess it doesn't do too well with soy sauce"
4,Christmas Gift,"This item was purchased as a Christmas gift. I found the price to be very competitive and, and best of all, free shipping. The item arrived as advertised."
5,Love it!!!,"Got this in July to dehydrate some of the produce from my garden. I am very happy with it!!! It's not too large, sits on the counter, and I can dehydrate so many things (even make jerky)!! I can put things in it in the morning and let it run all day, or put them in at night and they're dried when I get up in the morning! I totally recommend this dehydrater!!!"
1,Warning: Jerky gun and accessories not included,"I ordered this specifically to make jerky treats for my dogs, but the jerky gun was not included as advertised. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that I only received 4 trays, not 5. I didn't get the fruit roll sheet or clean-a-screen that were promised. All I got was a four-tray dehydrator in the NESCO box, no outer packaging. Very disappointed.UPDATE 12/20: Despite exchanging several e-mails with the seller about the missing pieces, the problem has not been resolved. All I receive are canned answers that do not address the problem. I would give this zero stars if it were possible."
4,nesco food dehydrator,"Easy to use...seems to take longer to dry food than it suggests, but still does a great job.very pleased with it!my friends have them and love them!"
4,Great Product!,"I would have given this 5 stars however, the ONE thing I wanted to make with this dehydrator the most takes about twice as long as they claim it should. My main intention was to make my own raisins. However, it takes about 24 hours to dry them out...when in the manual is says 6-12.Everything comes out great though, that I have made so far. Bananas, apples, strawberries, kiwi and eventually the grapes!!! But it is very quiet, easy to clean. I have already used it 3 times in the past month. I just really hope it doesn't spike my electric bill too much. From what I've read about dehydrators it shouldn't...but I just really hope from the continuous 24 hour grape drying it won't. Figures, apple slices dry in 4 hours!!But overall it is a great little machine. Haven't tried the jerky making yet, looking forward to that. It is nice having dried fruit snacks on hand to take with you wherever, I think I end up eating more fruit this way...don't have to wash and prepare it, just grab it and go!"
4,Works well for making my dogs snacks.,I bought this with the specific idea of making my dogs dehydratged snacks as he is alergic to many things. It works so well. He enjoys every bite.
4,Great dehydrator!,"I bought this for my wife to dehydrate fruits for the kids. I bought the version with the jerky maker kit because I thought it might be cool.I tried the jerky with the seasoning kit they include and the ""caulk gun"" like dispenser and it was fantastic.There are plenty of jerky spice makers out there that are cheaper than Nesco but I havent tried them yet.I has tried one that was not heated before buying this and in Texas it is worthless! Heat is the way to go to get quick results."
5,food dehydrater,We bought this for our dog to make chicken jerky. It was very easy to use and worked great. It came with seasoning packets and recipe booklet. We checked other dehydrators online and this one seemed to suit our purpose the best. The reason we wanted to make our own jerky was because of the problem with dogs getting sick from the chicken jerky coming from China.
5,Love it!!,"I haven't used the jerky gun, yet, but I use the dehydrator at least once a week and I love it! I make treats for my dogs (liver treats, chicken hearts and gizzards, sweet potatoes, banana chips) and treats for me (pears, apples, bananas, jerky) and I dry onions, peppers, tomatoes, etc. for soups and casseroles. It has saved a ton of money in dog treats alone and I know they are safe!"
5,Dehydrator with jerky gun,"Oh my gosh ... the jerky is the best ever. My family and friends say ""keep making it"", and it makes the house smell delicious as it is drying. I haven't used the dehydrator for fruits or vegetables yet, but wouldn't mind just using it for jerky. I used ground turkey and the original seasoning mix, I can't believe how easy it is. One pound made about 30 pieces of jerky, and it only took about 5-6 hours to dehydrate. It does put out a bit of heat while running, and it does make a low noise. All is all this is fantastic, so glad I tried it."
5,Makes great jerky,"I got this mostly to make jerky and dried chicken treats for my dogs. So far, the jerky I've made using this machine and the spice packets that were included with it has been outstanding. If it proves reliable I'll be very happy with it, and I plan to try some of the other Nesco spice blends."
5,Much better than I expected it would be.,I research more than several products and I am extremely happy that I chose this one. It exceeded my expectations.
3,GREATEST HITS--YEAH RIGHT!,"True Sylvers fans know that this CD can't possibly be considered their GREATEST HITS! without ""Misdemeanor"" and ""Fools Paradise""."
3,Another missing hit from this list!!!hmmph..,"I think this list is too short.Believe it or not there are a lot of Sylvers fans still out there.Besides the two songs mentioned I'm just gonna add that ""I'll Never Be Ashamed Again"" should be on the list somehow.Anywhere.Please???"
5,Poet with a Guitar,"A poet of the new age, his lyrics are original as well as his unique style. Most of all he ha something to tell and he does it so beautifully. His music just brings to mind something you can just relate with him about."
2,Very plain ordinary straight ahead AOR,"Bought this CD mainly beacause of the other good reviews on this site, but I couldn't find anything great regarding this CD.It's not bad, but it's so average and boring.Listen to Moxy or Hunt instead.I'll give it two (**) stars instead of one (*) because Nantucket have a little touch of Styx, Foreigner, Hobbit etc......."
4,GREAT TO SEE NANTUCKET ON CD FINALLY!!!,"This brings back some memories! I first heard ""Heartbreaker"" when I was a college student on Long Island in 1978 and said ""who are these guys?"" Great, hard drivin', honky tonkin' tunes here with a pleasant mixture of variety in the context of each song. Though Tommy Redd's vocals are somtimes too shaky and uneven and some of the songs are just average overall, songs like ""Heartbreaker"", ""Never Gonna Take Your Lies"", ""She's No Good"", Born In A Honky Tonk"" and ""What's The Matter With Loving You"" drive this CD to a great time down memory lane!!!!!"
4,It's good.,"In the very beginning, this was my least favorite album from Ayumi Hamasaki. I mean, I didn't hate the album...it just never caught my interest. But I was determined to give this album a chance. So I decided to buy it...and so far, I haven't regretted it. It just took a WHILE to grow on me. When reviewing this album, there were plently of awesome tracks that shows me how to love this complex album. Tracks like ""Catcher in the Light"" ""Game"" ""Happy Ending"" ""Inspire"" ""My Name's WOMAN"" ""Moments"" ""Honey"" ""Walking Proud"" and ""Kaleidoscope"" were the biggest contributers when debating of purchasing this album.Ever since then, all the other tracks have slowly grown on me. And from the powerful lyrics, I can tell Ayu worked real hard on it...so I won't disappoint her as a fan!Although it isn't my ultimate favorite album from her, I can say it will remain one of greatest hits released from her."
3,Medical Miracles Strike Again!,"As I read romance novels in no particular order, I'd just finished Diana Palmer's ""Lacy"" when I went on to tackle her ""Lord of the Desert."" How interesting that both novels feature heroes who have been declared medically incapable of propagation and yet [here follows a spoiler] overcome this difficulty as if they were just getting over a cold, all because they each meet the ""right"" woman who somehow has the power to revitalize damaged testicles. I'll grant that this sort of thing can be swallowed once, but twice? Not so much.That said, I did like Gretchen, Leila, and the hero's father. As for Philippe, the titular hero, he seemed seriously out of focus, which was best reflected in how he played the very games he admired Gretchen for not playing. I'm fine with alpha males possessing a high degree of arrogance, but not this level of hypocrisy."
2,"book is great, audio tapes are a disappointment","I really liked the book, so when I found the audio book of the story I bought it. I listened to it and was impressed with the quality of the narrator and the way she brought the story to life. However, there is a problem with the audio version. My version (2 cassettes) only tells the first half of the story with an altered ending. I was so frustrated by the sudden cutting off of the story that I felt compelled to read the second half in my book. Do not buy the audio version if it has 2 cassettes. It is a definite disappointment."
5,AWESOME!,"I have read most of Palmer's books and this is a 5+.I could not put it down, loved it. I so enjoy howcharacters of other books are drawn in to the story.I'm having a hard time going on to another book afterthis one. Ugh!"
1,Yuck,"What an absolutely silly book! It's poorly written, completely predictable and unconvincing! I was unable to get interested in the characters or the events, and the writing was tedious!"
3,Arena Football,"It's an all right game. It's more for the arena fans, I enjoy it, but it could be better."
1,if you're askin - I'm tellin,"add sugar and get your own yeast and perhapssssssss, you will have a challa. Tried it by hand, tried in my machine - little rise. The yeast didn't bubble when I added it 1st... Convenience has once again taken my money."
3,Could Have Been Better,"I like her modern twist on the old fairytale, but after all the dirt the evil stepsisters did to Cynthia, the ending was a let down. She of course got her ""prince"" and the company in the end but I would like to have seen them really be evious of Cynthia. Also, there were things left out, she mentions Cythia's mother in regard to her skin color, but that is the only reference. It would have been nice for her to mention a little more of what life was like for Cynthia before the evil steps came into her life. It was a easy and quick read though. I will try one of her other books."
3,Wrong item for a 4x2. Good for a 4x4.,This item should not be listed as compatible with my 1995 Chevy s10 4x2. It has an extra gear sprocket on it meant for the 4x4. Looked good but I had to return it and get a cheaper one at my local auto parts store.
1,Beware the Wounded Bird Records issue of this disc...,"I specifically bought this disc for the Ann Wilson duet, already having the album on vinyl. Much to my horror--this is the absolute worst sounding quality CD I've ever heard! There is constant upfront hiss throughout the entire disc, and the music sounds far back--with a horrible thin tin quality. Do NOT buy the wounded bird records re-issue."
1,BLADDER CONTROL,"I bought this doll online for my daughter, who is going to be starting potty traing. This was supposedly one of the better ones on the market, after I did some research, I purchased it. When I got the doll we got all ready to use the doll and let her go potty, I assumed that she would not pee until I sat her on the potty or something similar. Much to my dismay, the doll as soon as you put the bottle in the dolls mouth she starts going!! EVERYWHERE! Needless to say I returned the item, and got the Little Mommy Potty Training doll, which uses magnets on her back, and the potty chair to make the baby go."
2,Potty Training Doll is a disappointment,"While my daughter likes this doll, it did not serve the purpose for which I intended. The plastic bottle was broken upon arrival, my daughter had trouble fitting the bottle into the dolls mouth and she also had trouble getting the baby to sit on the potty that came with the doll while she was feeding it (because the doll pees immediately). I would not recommend this product."
1,"If you are in the Radio Industry, avoid this one",This album follows in the grand tradition of cashing in on a fad by regurgitating it with a mind numbing BOOM CLAP BOOM CLAP BOOM CLAP overdub. The only thing more embarrassing than liking this kind of nausea is recommending it to other people.
1,Don't Be Fooled by This Album,"First off, I only gave this CD one star because there is no option for zero. The music on this disc is a pure mockery of true Swing music. Electronic devices are fine for creating Pop and Techno type music, but they have no place in Big Band. If anything, only use this disc as a reference to find the original material. Take a look at the discs track list, then do searches on the song titles listed to find the recordings by the original artists. Example, ""Will Get It"" by Tommy Dorsey is a great tune, but you never could tell by listening to the version on this disc."
3,"Not bad, not great","two words - ""techno swing""In a way this CD reminds me of Jive Bunny & the Master Mixers swing attempts.my biggest gripe is the drum machine"
5,One of my favorite books,"I love this book. it totaly humanizes the couple. And not just the media hype surrpounding her death and the antics of the sex pistols. I can understand what her parents went through, with her being olmost normal one day and all strung out on drugs and being irrational the next. I have a parent like that and I constantly have been put in the position of being more the adult than she is, The book is just wonderful in detailing the trials and the amazing strength her loving family had for their poor little misunderstood child."
2,A must read subject but look elsewhere for your information.,"I was not thrilled with this book. I found the basic information enlightening but didn't get the impression that it was well researched and thought out, just taken from other easy to find sources. I would definitely read more on the subject but wouldn't buy another book by this author. I just read the reviews on one of this author's other books and can see a pattern."
1,Trite and shallow,"This book does a huge disservice to the serious issue of human trafficking. It is very poorly researched, highly derivitive, and badly written. It does not even begin to grapple with the complications of the global trade in human beings but instead relies on sensation and titillation. I would not accept this from an undergraduate.There is a real need for accessible information on the subject of human trafficking in order to make individuals, communities and governments aware of what is going on and how they can work to stop this sad trade. Unfortunately this book does not even begin to meet that need."
2,2 stars simply becacuse the author picked an important subject,"Lacks just about everything:insight, depth, substance, reasearch, a professional approach.. It reads like an essay I would have written in high school. Don't waste money on it. Your time (and money) is better spent on Wikipedia."
2,Poor,I was really disappointed in this book. It was very amateurish and shallowly researched. There is a lengthy section on slavery throughout [Western] history that comes across as filler rather than as background for the subject. I didn't get the sense that the author did any original scholarship or conducted any interviews to write this book.
2,they sent me a library book,The seller sent me a library book from the Salt Lake City Library.The book itself isn't very good. It talks alot about Tapestry against poligamy and is written by one of the members. The book is a hodge podge of sometimes crappy and sometimes interesting stories of women who've escapped poligamy.The stories tend to be to brief and vague to create to much care.
4,Snack on this!,"This is one of the best of the label's offerings, behind the legendary Nude Dimensions Vol.1 and Carte Blanche Vol.2. The best song on this by far is the Rurals' ""I've Traveled the World"". The cd is worth owning for that one song. All in all, a completely justifiable purchase."
4,Tight disc...but not Naked's best,"This is a quality, mid-tempo disc. Not the best for Naked's standards, but if it's on the Naked Music label, its usually good, and this is no exception. Im not quite sure what they were thinking by including Aim's ""Cold Water Music"", it doesn't fit the mood of the disc and isn't very good to start with. Other than that...another quality disc from the smooth producers at Naked Music."
2,Pretty bland stuff,"Look for interesting vocal arrangements of these classics elsewhere - this is pretty bland stuff, with the medleys (Snow White and Mary Poppins) coming off especially forced. The ballads here are some of the best written for Disney productions, but all are given generic, ploddy and syrupy sweet renditions. Of the other numbers, ""Winnie the Pooh"" made me yearn for the Louis Prima version, and ""It's a Small World"" had me leaping for the fast forward button. There are bright spots, however, and they are dandies: a rousing ""Bare Neccessities"" complete with a snazzy kickline coda and a terrific, wonderfully arranged ""Zip a Dee Doo Dah"" that is sure to put a smile on your face and a spring in your step. Two stars for two good cuts on an otherwise blah CD."
4,Very good!,"Most of the songs were well performed on this CD!You'll love the upbeat 70s tempo and you'll be singing along and tappinng your feet.The only gripe I have about this CD is the slow and boring ""Lavender Blue""-it's so slow that it will put you to sleep.I personally think they should've done ""Tiki Room"" or ""So This Is Love"" instead."
4,Theory of Systems Thinking,"""Systems thinking"" is a straight forward concept that concerns an understanding of a system by examining the linkages and interactions between the elements that compose the entirety of the system. The reader looking to this book for an exposition of this concept and perhaps examples of its application will be very disappointed.The operative word in the title of this book is ""Introduction."" What Weinberg provides is not a discussion of systems thinking as such, but an elegant and well thought out set of proofs that demonstrate why systems thinking actually works and provide the foundation of an underlying theory of systems thinking. This is quite different from most of the literature on systems analysis and systems research, but this book provides a foundation for both of these disciplines. As such it has a unique place in the literature of this subject."
3,not quite an alternative to 'Systems Thinking',"I was searching for an alternative to the out-of-print book 'Quality Software Management, vol.1: Systems Thinking', written by the same Author.Having read few Sofware Management series books from the same Author, which I rate at the very top of my list, I was biased on very high expectations. Surprisingly, I have found it being quite verbose and in the end, I couldn't get too much inspiration out of it."
3,O.K.,This is not as good as their first. I still thought it was a good effort. I guess the Rza was busy pushing Wu's double CD.
5,And again they brake da rools of insanity (ARE THERE ANY??),"After the first album I started smashing tombstones and started messing with skeletons on the graveyard downtown. This is awesome, hardcore and sick to the bone (hehe). No-one comes out alive!"
4,Contemporary Triumph,"The often heard lament that jazz just isn't as good as it use to be might be more clique than reality. Quite simply, this cd is excellent for its melodic fusion of American and African instrumentation. This is very serious jazz.I was exposed to the cd by the best radio station in the world-- WPFW, which can be listened to outside the D.C. area by visiting www.wpfw.org."
2,JUST GET THE FULL SESAON,i'm not sure why moonscope is releasing the seasons as a full and seperate. For 5 episodes it cost 9 dollars. WHEN for the full season of 26 episodes cost 22 dollars. It makes no sense to buy the episodes individuality like this just buy the full season!
4,"Loved Death as ""Santa Claus"".","I really need to read the book to see what the problems are that the other reviewers mentioned. To me, if one pays attention, one should have little trouble figuring out the movie.I enjoyed the portrayal of Death stumbling through the role of 'Santa Claus'.The actress portraying Death's daughter was a bit flat but passable.I didn't understand some of Deaths actions in the sand library.The only real annoyance was Mr. Teatime. Not sure if he was supposed to get on your nerves but he got on mine. The voice acting of Mr. Teatime was dreadful. He sounded like a man from England trying to be American. And maybe it was part of his character in the book but he kept correcting people with different pronunciations of his name ""tee-uh-tar-may"", ""tee-uh-tie-may"", ""tee-uh-tar-mee"", ""tee-uh-tie-mee"".The movie did feel rushed (which would make sense if things were indeed left out from the book) but I still liked it enough to watch it twice this Christmas."
4,A New Father Christmas,"It is a delightful, fresh contribution to the Christmas collection. I loved the Death character subsituting for our Santa Clause"
2,has the director heard of dry humour?,"Terry Pratchett is by far my favorite author but I was bitterly disappointed by this movie. The casting was truly awful and the movie had none of the dry humour that is the driving force behind Pratchett's books. Teatime, Susan and Ridcully were portrayed so badly that I only got about 1/2 an hour into before I was forced to turn it off. Why is it that whenever anyone makes a fantasy movie, the acting is always so corny? The humour in the books stands up quite well without the need for overacting. Next time someone makes one of these movies it would be refreshing indeed if they directed it the same way one would direct any modern comedy or even a serious drama and not the way one would direct a high school musical. Obviously I am in a minority and though I am a huge Pratchett fan I can't recommend this movie to anyone."
3,I just rented it,"""Disappointment"" would be putting it kindly.No, I'm not talking about the content of this movie--as far as I can tell, it is, in fact, rather faithful (almost page by page) in its depiction of the book.Unfortunately, that ""as far as I can tell"" is precious little, since it's neither subtitled nor closed-captioned--a feature that I would have greatly appreciated as a deaf man and rabid fan of Terry Pratchett's work.I know it's futile to say anything about it here (especially considering that most other imported British movies--especially made-for-TV productions--have the same failing), but I just wanted to register in some way how let-down I felt.Poo."
2,Would have been great.. IF,This would have been great.... IF it had closed captioning. Deaf people like terry pratchett too!
4,Big G,"Hog Father is a wonderfull twist to Santa Clause, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy. The ensamble cast is great and the dialog is witty. If you enjoyed ""The Princess Bride"" check out ""The Hogfather""."
2,Disappointing,"I love every Terry Pratchett book I've ever read. They amuse while inspiring thought; a great combination in my opinion. So it is with regret I say I fell asleep watching this DVD.The background music was constant, annoying and made it difficult to hear the dialogue. Somehow the witty dialogue in the book did not come alivein the movie. I didn't laugh even once! The wizards were thin!I fell asleep before I saw the whole thing. I will try to watch it again, all the way through, but at this point I cannot recommend it to anyone. That makes me sad."
1,Unusable disc,This may well be a fine product but I am not going to be able to find this out as it is unplayable on my US made computer and DVD players. Very disappointing for wasted hard earned dollars. No warning posted on product that it would be unusable in the US.
5,Our new holiday favorite!,"We all really enjoyed ""Hogfather"". I haven't read the book, so I didn't miss what wasn't in the movie. Very funny stuff and great characters!"
5,Wonderful Movie for Anytime!,"Now, I haven't actually read the Discworld novel that the movie is based on....yet. However, the movie kept me completely entranced and I fell in love with Death and Susan, plus the Grimsqueaker. Fantastic movie that keeps you entertained. Hell! I even decided that I want to celebrate Hogswatch now!!! :)"
4,Hogfather,"My husband loves this silly movie, especially Father Death. My young adult children love it too. I think it is ridiculous."
4,Unique fairy tale,"I hadn't read any of Terry Pratchett's books, but the premises and characters of this were very entertaining. Probably not for everyone, if you like fantasy and sarcasm and enjoy the British sense of humor you might want to try it out."
3,Excited and disappointed,I knew nothing of the Discworld. I stumbled upon this movie when it played on ION in 2008. I loved it. I bought the DVD to share with friends. This DVD started in the middle - Chapter 2. I do no understand why.I am buying the books and starting from the beginning.
4,Cha de Bugre - GREAT VALUE,"I was interested in Cha de Bugre liquid extreact instead of the capsule formulation. I like sublingual things with certain products.It is difficult to find Cha de Bugre in a liquid extract at all let alone for a smart price. This product is both. I would have been ecstatic with it had I not spilled most of the bottle when I first used it.That was my second time using this product from this company. Their shipping is fast, the product is potent and long lasting making it a great value for a small price!"
5,"Plain and simple, the best ends out there!","This is a quality product. The ends are made with superb craftsmanship and engineering. The design that went into these to keep from your cord pulling on your solder joints is great. Not only is it high quality but it looks great. I like the black ones too, but I always seem to lean to towards silver. These are the best ends out there in my opinion!"
4,"Good, but not great","This CD seems to alternate between great valleys and peaks... and just mediocre repetitions of the same synth line over and over. It's no Christopher Lawrence or Sandra Collins, but it's still worth getting your hands on."
4,"An excellent middle, but the beginning and end are blah","First off, I'd have given this 3.5 stars, but that's not an option. I got this because I wanted to support and try American trance (outside of the Hook recording label). The disc gets off to a bad start, with Ryan's way too keyboardy and blippy Pistolwhip. With track 2 it gets into a groove, with Johnson sounding similar to underworld circa 1997. It then hits it's peak with excellent tracks 3-6, before descending once again with Ryan's 5-note keyboard melody track 7. Track 8 is one step away from new age music, but then 9-11 make a nice comeback. So get this disc if you are willing to buy it for a 5 song chunk and a 3-song chunk. And hey, if you like the tunes I didn't, you'll think it's even better."
2,interesting,have had this cd since it came out but never listened to it. It has some truly interesting work on it. Most of it is sort of shoegazer downtempo but with a bit more punch. If the songs were trimmed down some or the vocalist did some more with his melody then the songs wouldn't drag.
5,The lyrics of small town life to music with class,"It's rare these days that bands are able to put together an album that refrains from repetition and song padding, and yet uses eloquence, subtlety and poetry in a concoction of real experience. Not that I'm into poetry and all that arty stuff, but we can all appreciate the sentiments of Kelly Jones and where he's coming from when he tells one of 12 stories on this excellent CD. Yes all the critics will reminisce about past influences, but who cares? This album is filled with songs that just get to the point, lifting your spirits with a spitting edge to the riffs, while disturbing your mind as the words sink in. Take a sampling of the smoother songs of Brit bands like The Verve, take out the chance of getting annoyed by Oasis taking a great song and stringing it out for 7 minutes, take out some overproduction, simmer over real life, real vocals, and real guitar and the Word deserves to Get Around!"
5,Stereophonics SUPERB!,"I really like this album quite a bit. It's just a great pop album with stunning lyrics. Not Up to You is by far my favorite song on the album, but all of the others are great too. Bottom line: just buy the damn CD, it won't disappoint."
5,The best album in the world,"This album is the best one that they have came out with. All of the songs are brilliant such as A thousand trees, More life in a tramps vest and local boy in the photograph. Sheer Class"
2,they suck,they suck they only have 1 good song and it is more life in a tramp's vest and that is the only good song out of all the songs on all of their cd's
5,just crude perfection,"I get the feeling that some take this album too seriously. As the artists say themselves, It's simply about drinking, skrewing and smoking."
4,Refreshing ska from Tallahassee,"I have been around the ska scene in Tallahassee for the past 5 years, and it has been a treat to watch The Double Deckers come in to their own. Through various lineup changes (the current lineup contains zero original members, in fact) and refinements in the sound, the band has created a sound that is unlike any other in the realm of ska in the world (as far as I have heard). The band pulls on styles from ska, swing, jazz, funk, pop, literally anything they can get their hands on. The most memorable tracks on the CD are of course the Tallahassee-infamous song ""Luke"", with quotings of music from the original Star Wars trilogy; ""Wendy"", a pop-ska song about a not-too-nice breakup; and ""Bus Stop"", a swing-ska track with some great sax and trumpet solos to swing dance to. There aren't many ska bands out there that have the same originality combined with talent and versatility to create such a unique sound. I highly reccomend this CD."
2,A Bit Lacking,"I would strongly urge anyone who is considering purchasing a package with the more notable Four Seasons hits on it, to avoid this Curb material, and try to go with Rhino or WB.....the sound quality is decidely better with those packages."
5,GREAT!!!,really really great. haven't had any problems. love it. plays great. came in good time. the discription for the product was good.
5,Charmed - Complete 3rd Season,"This was a gift for my granddaughter. She loves it !! In my book, that's 5 stars."
5,Another Great Season,"I love this season of Charmed and it's one of my favorites. I think the best overall is Season Two but this one is also great. The show definitely got a lot darker this year especially with the addition of the character Cole Turner, a half human/half demon, who falls in love with Phoebe. This was also the year when Piper and Leo get married. Yay!There were lots of fun episodes here but some of the best for me are-The Honeymoon's Over, Once Upon a Time, Sight Unseen, Power Outage, Coyote Piper, We All Scream For Ice Cream, Bride And Gloom,and Exit Strategy.This was sadly Shannen Doherty's final season so it's a must to own just for sentimental value. Prue will always be my favorite Charmed One. A must buy season!"
5,"Three's the ""Charm""","I've loved ""Charmed"" since it aired 8 years ago. I've watched the characters grow, some of them die, some get married, and some eventually have children. If you like ""Charmed"" as much as I do, then you'll love getting each season on DVD. I don't work for any ad company, and I'm not trying to push the selling of DVD's on anyone. I think I own one other DVD other than my ""Charmed"" collection. I have seasons one thru five on DVD so far, and I won't stop until I've got them all!"
5,Best game ever,I liked the contests that the game has. I also like all the new features. Finally you are selling a great game. Thank you for letting me share my review.
3,Shannen did not quite die in this Season,"I was looking forward to find out if Shannen died in this Season was told she did but NO! A bit disappointed though. However, the show is still alright tough not as good as the one in 1st Season. Have found this season a bit less interesting."
1,poor quality,"The disc were scratched, so badly that they froze every time attempted to play. The disc were a gift to someone and they didn't watch them immediatedly."
4,wonderful,"I dug out my collection of charmed the other day, (too much time on my hands) and I spent hours watching them. Charmed is a fantastic show. I wish they hadn't stopped. I miss this show and a shame all good things have to end. The actresses are amazing and the story-lines in each and every episode are spectacular."
1,charmed season 3,Came without cases... skips & glitches on multiple episodes... wish this would have been explained in the discription.. dissapointed felt stupid giving this as a gift
5,The best ones are with Cole :),"I think Charmed is a really cool show. I personally Like cole, and Leo, and pipers one boyfriend the blond guy. Anyway, I own the first season and loved it, but i was sick of the same episodes. I was so thrilled that the second and thid came out so quickly. I'm trying to get a hold of all three. So I can have a charmed marathon. Try charmed today. Later!!!!!!!"
3,Charmed DVD,I expected a little better product the outside is covered in nasty stuff. I guess its true you get what you pay for.
5,charmed the best!!,Charmed is one of my favorite shows. I started watching it later in the seasons. THen I was hooked. I loved Shannon Doherty's Prue. My favorite is Piper first then Prue. I was very sad when Prue was killed off. Paige is ok but not as good as prue. Hopefully someday we will see prue come back even if only for a small part.
5,The best season season ever !,"This season was the best.Prue,Piper,Phobe kick ass in this season dealing with Bethazar(Phobe's half demon boyfriend Cole turner, but now is gone) and many powerful demons to come. This season is alo important considering this is the last season with Shannen. I liked her so much. When she fought she kind of reminded me of Xena, just seeing her move with with fast kicks and doing flips and stuff. If your a Charmed fan get this season because this season is the #hit!! This is where the action really begins."
5,Finally on DVD,"I am a charmed fan who has been waiting to get this show on dvd since season two aired. I am going to be getting the entire series, and if you are a fan of show i recommend the purchase. The dvd is great, arrived as expected no complaints."
4,lovveee ittt!,i really love this season! its so good and i am so glad i bought it. its got a lot of action and the ending is so suspensful. i would definetly buy it if i were youu!
4,"Prue's last season, Cole's first","I am a die hard charmed fan, and have seasons 1-3 already and can't wait for the rest to come out. The only thing that I can find fault with on the DVD's is that they leave out some episodes and so therefore if you haven't seen it from the beginning it can leave some blanks and questions. If you can over look that it is a great series to buy."
5,charmed- the complete third season,"I am very happy with this product. it got here rather fast, and was in great shape."
3,mostly second season,"I am disappointed that all but one or two of the episodes on this latest DVD are from the inferior second season. Several of our favorite first season episodes, such as ""Candy Counter"", ""Invisible Sound"", and ""Turbo Python 3000"" are still not available on DVD.For reference here is the full episode list:- Curious George Beats the Band- Old McGeorgie Had a Farm- Monkey Stagehand- The Elephant Upstairs- Skunked- Color Me Monkey- Zeros to Donuts- Special Delivery Monkey"
5,George Rocks!,"Curious George is by far and away my 2 and 3 year olds favorite. We have the original Will Ferrel/ Drew Barrymore movie plus all the TV shows on DVD yet released and they absolutely love them. Cute and well written for a young audience, even grows on the parents. Treat your toddler to these gems and they will be hooked."
5,always very pleasant and fun to learn from,My littel girl (3 years) has watched all of the dvd repeatedly. She really does learn from them and loves to watch them.
3,So so,"This doll doesn't look like a Barbie, but not bad if you don't care Barbies should have a Barbie face. She has a little bit bigger face, she is also a little bit bigger than a normal Barbie. I didn't return it back because it was so cheap and doesn't worth it!"
5,Remington 870 Scope Mount,"The product was new in original container and simple to install, just push out the original pins and insert screws through the receiver, no problems."
5,Worked well for me,"Easy install on my Remington 870 (only took about 5 minutes from start to finish), does not interfere with the ejection of the cartridges. Good strong sturdy mount, I'm very happy with mine."
3,Not my cup of tea,"Ian and Reyna are strong characters, but he's too macho for my taste and she could use more inner strength. She succumbs so easily. There's lots of intrigue and it's passionate. But the book is too long and has little heart until the end.It's been a while since I read it and I took few notes, so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt with 3 stars."
3,readable,"I really enjoyed Hunter's Rules of Seduction and thought I'd give more of her books a try. I can't say the experience of reading this particular book put me off this author, but I would read the back cover more closely the next time.I bought the book because the title and the cover confused me into thinking this was an Arabian Nights story. Wrong. This was just another English knight conquering a Scottish castle and its lady. The lady tries to get rid of her enemy, then fails and falls madly in love with her conqueror, and accepts his domination with open arms.As it turns out, this was not an awful read. Could have been better with a less ""tired"" storyline."
3,Two many twists and turns,"This book lacked focus. I think the writer really over reached here. The romance was wrapped up too quickly due to a unexpectedly early capitulation by the heroine. The book then morphed into a mish mash of back and side stories, full of surprises and too many characters at every turn. Sigh.If you want a good early Madeline Hunter, stick with Stealing Heaven or By Design. Great history. And not bad love stories either."
5,spectacular,"I've been dying to read this book since I've finished the Protector. It was all that I've been waiting for and more. Madeline Hunter a standing ovation for your books.Reyna and Morvan are the perfect pair and they would not be forgotten. With the action,adventure political intrigue, they make this book for what it is ""A keeper and the perfect gift to any true historical romance reader. Thanks Madeline Hunter and looking forward to your other books."
3,not her best,"I rarely read this genre but happened to pick one of her first books up at the grocery store many years ago. It was brilliant! The Arrangement led me to read her books for several years. Her style is quite nice especially for this type of book. SHe definitely has strong writing skills. Unfortunately, starting with this book, she has gone to the dark side. She writes prolifically and poorly so much so that when I see her name, I avoid the work altogether.I know she can do better and hope that good work will once again beat her ""hurry up and write a formulaic novel"" approach very soon. I read often and like a variety of work. This one is not bad, but also not very good."
3,Could have been better,"This book was a little hard to get through until David, Christiana, Anna, and Morvan (from By Arrangement and The Protector) would show up. Morvan should probably have had a bigger role in this since it was his quest for Harclow that moved the story from the beginning, but his wife Anna, though gruffer than in their book was still fun. David is great as usual. Christiana is graceful and strong and I really enjoyed her. I kept wishing that this book could have been about those four and that Reyna and Ian were secondary characters instead. Their story just isn't very focused, and Ian's past ""sin"" that he suddenly worries about towards the end really doesn't drive the story at all. The Lord of A Thousand Nights title bestowed on Ian was a bit silly. There was nothing really exciting about how he finds the treasure either. All in all I'll still give it three stars, more for the characters from the other books showing up than the hero and heroine's story."
3,It was just okay,"I thought this book was just...okay. Whenever I encounter a book with a storyline similar to that of The Wolf and the Dove by Kathleen Woodiwiss, it's very difficult not to compare. Lord of a Thousand Nights portrays a hardly believable heroine who is very shrewish and mouthy, especially one whose home has been conquered by the hero of the story. Ian portrays a very good hero but his fault is, as I mentioned earlier, is that he's far too accommodating of Reyna even to the point that he seems more like a suitor than a conqueror and new lord of Reyna's home.Despite that, I still recommend this book. Read it and decide for yourself."
4,Justice Served For the RX7,Matras did a very nice job of composing this book on the much-loved mazda rx-7.
2,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to receiving this CD. When I got it, I discovered that these were re-recordings of the songs, not the originals. While the sound is very similar to the original recordings, they just aren't the same. I expected the originals and nothing about the description warned me that these weren't going to be them. I ended up ordering the original albums to get the songs in their original recorded forms. For me, at least, this was a total waste of money."
2,A bitter disappointment,"I was so very disappointed with this. When I recieved it I placed it in my player right away and went straight to ""Ebony Eyes"" and when I heard it, that is where the disappointment hit. It sounded nothing like when I grew up hearing it. That's when I checked and found the caption ""New digital recordings"". I couldn't even bring myself to listen to the rest of it. I took it out, put it back in the case, and haven't even looked at it again. I'd try for a refund, but I think someone close to me will want it so I plan to give it to them."
2,Bob Welch Greatest Hits,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED NOT ORIGINAL MUSIC A TOTAL REDUX OF THE MEMORABLE SONGS!! ONLY RECOMMEND IF YOU LIKE BOB WELCH!!!!
5,Still with me after all these years. . .,"I read this book way back in the dark ages -- early 1980s -- when I was an undergraduate at the University of Kentucky. It was great -- a bent, lunatic Thousand And One Nights sort of thing. I can't believe this is out of print. What on earth is this world coming to?"
5,Thought provoking book!,The Fringe and the Fury was the most thought provoking book I read this year. It is an interesting combination of the spiritual and science fiction. The characters are well-developed and the plot is interesting. This is a book you'll be thinking about for weeks after you've finished reading it!
4,Scientific Man meets the Creator...,"This is the story of Morgan Calendir... Nach Man of Deas, Edge Searcher, and his experience with a new world order in the not so distant future. It is a composite of science, religion, politics, told by flesh and blood characters torn between devotion to the State and their own inner doubts about the world to come. The reader is exposed to the horrors of genetic engineering, population control, and a City which is a fabricated Paradise more beautiful than anything imaginable...except the Origin of all."
3,fire in the stone,"Excellent movie and I was glad to get a copy.However I thought this product was the original version producded in Australia. Although the film was authentic, I was dissappointed to find that some of the original voices had been dubbed over.If this was made clear in the description then I missed it but I don't believe it was. It should have been pointed out in the description."
3,Opal yarn fails to sparkle,"Great setting, spectacular scenery, but just average in the handling of the story. I'm Australian too, so let's spell the town right: Coober Pedy."
2,"Gives light, but that's about all","Dont buy this. Vastly overpriced for the build quality. On top of that the box appeared to have been opened and re-sealed. That feeling was confirmed when I found a small part missing upon assembly. I have a shop, and fabricated a replacement rather than trying to get the part from the seller. Keep looking."
4,Cali girl doll review,"I think that this doll is cool and fun.But in terms of educational purposes, it is definetly below 0.I think that this toy is sold at a good value.But i, personnally, think that it should at least have something educational about it. The only thing educational, well a little bit, is teaching you to dress up a doll."
1,Buyer Beware,God help the fool that buys PCTV Deluxe! No support and no updated drivers. Pinnacle has moved on to something else. I lost money on this garbage. I would give it a zero star if that option existed.
1,Will not work with XP service pack 2,"It worked fine for a while and when I uploaded SP-2 it stopped. It doesn't say this on their website but the tech I got on the phone after 40 minutes said ""uhhh Yeah, Microsoft really doesn't like us"" I'm not sure what that means but there isn't a fix for this yet (7 Dec 04)"
2,A summer of TV on my PC,"I bought this product in March. I was quite happy with the ease of instalation and the quality of the TV picture on my monitor. However, now it is November and the tuner seems to have completely crapped out. I went to the Pinnacle web site, and I found out the guarantee is 30 days and the problem with total failure at 6 months or so is pretty common. I was directed to an on line b-board where there were a number of postings of buyers whose experience was exactly like mine. There seems to be no recourse or fix other than replacement at my cost."
1,Useless Garbage,"I am very disappointed with this product. I was upgrading my video capture to include the PVR option, so I purchased this product. Big mistake. The remote control didn't seem to work at all, no matter how close I sat to the unit. It seemed to take forever to switch between channels. I am not one to surf, but I was still frustrated. After prolonged use, the box seemed to overheat, causing it to mysteriously change channels, mute the volume, or perform other strange behavior. The software was user friendly, but that is little consolation for a poor piece of hardware. I unplugged it & threw it away, and have since bought an internal card by another manufacturer. Stay away from this one."
1,stay away...,"Install is buggy, you will have to manually edit registry, manually copy some files into the right place because the install does not. Performance is poor, video quality is good when it works. This is a version 1 product. Maybe in a year or so when pinnacle figures out how to get the install to work and debugs their drivers. Until then stay away..."
1,This device is horrible.,I have this connected to a dedicated PC with a gig of ram and it locks up every 3-5 hours. You have to cycle power to the unit and restart the software. Pinnacle is aware of the issues with this device. Please do your research on this device before buying. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
2,Catholic Book of Why,"The title is somewhat inappropriate as it dedicates more time to explaining why Catholics believe the way they do, although on occasion the author does get past the traditional reasoning and apologetics.It is easy to read and does cover a wide variety of topics within Christianity. There are a few references to Judaism and Islam, but almost nothing of the other world religions.This book may be helpful for those who have read little or nothing regarding the history of religions, especially the Catholic faith. However, a superior book on the origins of Christian practices would be *Two Babylons or the Papal Worship* by Alexander Hislop."
1,Not very profound,"Mr. Panati looks at religion from an American Catholic perspective. He is unaware that European Catholics often use white wine for Communion, or that the Orthodox have not separated Baptism and Confirmation as the Western Churches have done. Having found those glaring errors, I stopped reading -- I can't trust the other information in the book."
1,what a toy.,I was misinformed about this.... i thought it was for a youth size pop up blind not a toy.Thanks.
2,The psycholgical gobbledygook marred an otherwise decent biography,"General Trimble merits a biography. He's a fascinating man. The author's efforts though reads more like a thesis written to submit both to the history and psychology departments rather than a biography meant for the reading public. I would've enjoyed more personal anecdotes relating to the General and would've liked to have see the constant references to Maslow's hierarchy of needs jettisoned completely. It seemed like an artificial appendage added to the book, and its insertion ranged from distracting to downright annoying. It made for a dull, pedantic read."
4,Does what it should very well.,Replaced an old Zoom 4400 that finally died. Works very well. Set up with your home PC or laptop in 5 mins and plug it into your game console - done. NOTE: Ignore the security concerns. In all my years (thousands of installs) I saw ONE guy who MIGHT have needed WPA security. Computer mags can talk you into anything. 128WEP is more than fine for home use; just choose a good passphrase.
2,Doesn't support WPA security,The product doesn't support WPA security. It uses the older and less secure WEP method; which means that you would have to downgrade the security on your router to use it.
5,Top Notch!,"Thoughtful, insightful, funny and poignant -- that's the mark of a great book. Ann Liguori is a masterful interviewer. The book is fast paced and easy to read. Perfect book for riding a train or sitting on the beach. She interviewed a wide variety of celebrities for this book and it turned into a very pleasureable reading experience. From Cheryl Ladd to Alice Cooper from Dan Quayle to Joe Pesci from Charles Barkley to Dennis Franz -- the list goes on and on. I can't say enough about this book and I look forward to reading her sequel."
1,I was very dissapointed,"I am a fan of Miss Lupone's, and love her live recording from a few years back, so I was very excited to recieve ""Matters of the Heart"". When I put it on, I was very surprised. Her voice doesn't sound as agile and confident as before, and her song selections, for the most part, are just awful! I don't know that ""matters of the heart"" is a strong enough ""theme"" as most songs ARE love songs, and despite THAT fact, she managed to include some that WERENT love songs.She also doesn't sound like she means the lyrics as she sings them. I gave this CD away. Maybe my friend will like it... I didn't."
2,Don't Cry for Me Patti,"Just the name Patti LuPone on any recording, movie or show and I had my money out to purchase it right away. I was disappointed with this latest release. If you skip from song to song, they all sound the same. It sounds as if it was all recorded in one afternoon session. Patti's voice still sounds great, I just wish the material was more fun like the Heat Wave album."
3,A solid cd with the best orchestral movements of any elo LP,"As a long time ELO fan, I thought this cd certainly possessed the novel ELO sound even without Jeff. The orchetral movements are outstanding and the best from ANY prior ELO output. The songs range in style and content, and at one point I thought I was listening to Lynard Skynard singing about a ""whiskey woman."" There are a number of tracks that are solid ELO reminescent of the Out of The Blue era. No regrets in the purchase. All said, it does not match the creativity and soulful brilliance of ""A New World Record."""
2,Nice try but you are no E.L.O.,"I agree in whole with Mr. Rizzo, these guy's aren't ELO. It is obvious that Jeff made these guys what they once were but without him, they are desparate. I know it sounds harsh but it is deserving. By using the name Electric Light Orchestra they should be held accaountable and to the standards that have been set while Jeff was a part of (the soul of) the group. If they were calling themselves by another name, then I could maybe appreciate thier work but until then......Not a chance."
3,Just not the same ...,"Musical styles tend to change with the decades. ELO (with Jeff Lynne) had changed their style of music ... the obvious change of course being moving forward sans strings & replacing them with synthesizers. But voices do not change ... perhaps get a little lower with age, but unless the change is intended by the singer, their voice, which is most identifiable, stays the same. For me, Lynne's voice is very special & IS ELO to me. While Moment of Truth is a musically sound, relatively enjoyable album, it cannot compare with ELO WITH Jeff Lynne at vocals. Yes, these guys are the core of what was ELO. Yes, I know the history. But to me, it's the voice that makes all the difference. Not knocking this album at all, just saying in my opinion, this is not an ELO album to me. Enjoy it for what it is, but they should call themselves THE ORCHESTRA and be done with it."
1,moment of silence,"I'm one of the biggest E.L.O. fans around, but when Bev Bevan came back with E.L.O. Part Two he almost destroyed the name. Jeff Lynne is the only man that can lead this group. Kelly Groucutt's vocals just don't cut it. Ex-Trickster vocalist Phil Bates helped, but he did'nt have very much to do. The only song i really enjoyed was ""Breakin' Down The Walls"", which Phil sang. Thankfully in 1999 Bev quit E.L.O. 2, and is maybe planning a Move reunion with Roy Wood. This pains me to give this group such a low mark, but it just isn't the real E.L.O."
4,2nd to Guitar Hero,"I had high hopes, probably too high. Guitar hero is much more fun. Although I think DK Bonga has potential... my gf's not really too interested so I'll have to get one of my buddies over to make a final ruling."
4,Bang Those Drums,"It really was surprising to me, but I honestly thought that the bongo controllers for the Nintendo Gamecube was a gimmick. I honestly thought that they wouldn't get very far, after the first Donkey Konga game, but I was actually wrong. When I tried these for Donkey Kong Jungle Beat in Toys R' Us, I was absolutely amazed at how simple and easy to use these drums really were. They truly are very easy to operate with, and work like a charm. Yet, this is truly the only way to play Donkey Kong Jungle Beat. You can't play it with the regular controller. Get these and beat the night away.Controller: B"
4,pricy but fun,"the bongos that go with DK Konga are fun. I admit I worry sometimes that I might hit them to hard, they are plastic. The $$ tag is a little steep. but I paied simalar prices for the wireless controler... Only think that could make it a little better is a handle for carrying."
5,Even toddler loved it!!,"My older kids think it is great (so do my husband & I, especially with lots of 'classic' 80's songs to have fun with) and my toddler loves the free-style version where she can smack the bongos to her heart's content (very sturdy with little hands). A must-have for any gamer!!!"
4,Definition Of A band,"........ as in a R&B;/Funk/Rock band. The demise of the black band is a sad reflection of the state of black music at the moment, but that aside, this CD showcases the best songs from the following CDs:Meant to Be Mint,From the Mint Factory,Definition of a Band, &Life's AquariumI do love the funk offering of 'Nobody does it better, but where Mint Condition excel is in their mid-tempo ballads. Songs like 'U send me swingin', 'So Fine' (ruff), what kind of Man (with insightful lyrics dealing with the issue of adultery/cheating), and the big full blown stomper 'Breakin' My Heart (Pretty Brown Eyes). Although most of these songs were released in the 90s, they do not sound dated, proof, if any was needed, that great songs never date. This is a good CD to start your discovery of Mint Condition, and I for one aim to purchase their other CDs. (the latest of which is:Livin' the Luxury Brown"
3,Enjoy the hits!,"This cd provides a collection of the great early hits and a few B-side tunes, that I was unfamiliar to me. On that note, it did not meet my expectations, but for others, it may be great. I am a selective fan of Mint Condition, especially of their ballads; not real big on their uptempo tunes."
4,Bringing Back Memories,I kept hearing the song playing in my head and started to think about what I was doing when it came out. This is the reason I purchased the CD. I am so glad that I was able to purchase it at such a reasonable price. It was like I went to the store and bought it the day it was released! I was so excited to have it. It sounds awesome; it was everything I expected it to be.
5,Very new to this,"I get the feeling that this book gives you a good start in regards to Ayurveda. This book has a lot of information and great recipes that are broken down into Vata, Pitta & Kapha. If you're looking at a recipe for Pitta and you're a Kapha, it tells you at the end of the recipe what you can substitute OR if you should avoid it. This book also gives you Dual-Dosha recommendations.It's easy to read and the beginning gives you a good overview of what you should know. I tend to be easily overwhelmed by too much information when starting something new. This book doesn't have that effect on me. I also like pictures in my cookbooks. I like to know how it should look if I've not made it before. I'm starting off with this book knowing there's a lot more to get into if I want."
5,Many levels of satisfaction,"Eat Taste Heal is an excellent and compelling introduction to Ayurvedic principles, and yet it is far more than that. A beautiful book, accessible and well-written, brilliantly organized, and full of delicious recipes and relevant insights for modern concerns. It has transformed our approach to and our interest in the food we eat. We have moved with relish from recipe to recipe, often returning to those dog-eared favorites. Each recipe can also be adapted to fit any dietary restriction. A satisfying accompaniment to any kitchen and a helpful resource to many lifestyle questions!David Anderson and Ashley Mayne"
3,Recipes Need Help,"If you want to learn about Ayurveda, this is an amazing book. The authors have found a way to explain complicated concepts in an easy way and there are many good examples. I highly recommend it if you are looking to learn more about Ayurveda in general. However, I've tried about 5 of the recipes and each one needed major modifications before it worked. I've never had a cookbook that had recipes that were so out of whack. I would move with caution with the recipes. Otherwise, I love the book."
5,"Contemporary, informative and beautifully presented","Sometimes it's hard to jump the hurdle on Ayurvedic diet texts. They somehow sound like they weren't written for western culture and often they weren't. This book is cutting edge and crystal clear. There are a whole variety of cuisines represented in the recipes which are clear and easy to follow with beautiful illustrations. There are clear explanations to help the reader find and understand their Ayurvedic types.I am on a wheat-free, sugar-free, dairy-free diet for health reasons and I found an abundance of recipes in this book that not only can I eat but they all look and taste delicious!"
1,Did anyone else try the recipes before writing reviews?,"The first recipe I made from this cookbook was awful. I mean downright inedible. After trying it twice, I determined that there must be two typos. I amended the recipe and it is edible but not great. I tried a few others and they also left me quite underwhelmed. Makes me not all that excited to try any more recipes and this cookbook has been relegated to the St. Vinny's basket. There are so many great cookbooks out there that this one seems a waste of time. The Ayervedic information in the front of the book is easily gotten elsewhere (it was nothing new)."
3,"Great ideas, poor editing","What's up with this book? I got it at the library and noticed a few errors in the recipes. I bought the book anyway because I like overall layout and the general feel of the recipes.After looking more carefully at the book, I have found a lot of annoying editing errors. Sometimes the ingredients in the instructions will be different than the ingredient list.In any case, it has a lot of really good ideas. Just be prepared to modify recipes as you go along."
5,Ayurvedic cooking at it's best,Eat-Taste-Heal was written as a cook book but it is also one of the clearest written explanation of the Ayurvedic system for restoring and keeping good health. The explanation of the medicinal thought behind the food groups and therefore recipes is motivating and of course the end result is delicious. I highly recommend you share this book with family and friends.
5,Eat-Taste-Heal,well balanced and relatively complete theory explanations with great fairly simple recipies - delightful book
5,"Eat, Taste, Heal Delivers Soul Food...","Eat-Taste-Heal is inspiring, informative and aesthetically superlative among food books of similar genre. Ayurvedic principals are clearly defined, and the meals are easily prepared. The pictures are exquisite and the overall layout is as beautiful as any coffee table display book I've ever owned."
4,Excellent!,"I'm so glad this was the ayurvedic book I chose to purchase.Beautiful book, excellent amount of information, well-organized, understandable, lovely photos!"
3,Not for me,This is a beautiful book with lovely photographs. But I didn't like a single recipe I made from it. They are a little more gourmet than what I use on a daily basis and none of the 5 or 6 that i made turned me on much. Not to say that someone else wouldn't love it.
3,"Meh, I'll replace it soon","So, I really looked forward to this book. I enjoy gym yoga, and I thought it might be fun to try out different food based on ayurveda. But mostly I wanted something to help me cook with more vegetables and a different style of food. The ayurveda aspect in this book is difficult to understand, too much text to read through. The recipees are all very complicated, and somewhat bland.I had read a review that this book was better at adapting the recipees to westerner's palates and grocery stores, but I disagree. It's good enough for now, I can modify the recipees, but I will replace this book with another one as soon as I find a better one."
5,fascinating,"If you are or wish to be in the marketing field, read this book. More information is packed into here than in dozens of other volumes I've read. Just save the money and the inane information overload and buy Predatory Marketing today!"
4,A glimpse into the past.,"A mildly difficult read, and some passages require mental stretching to be adequately wrapped in thought, but it gives a spoiled modern a good idea of what used to be important to ancient peoples."
2,:(,I made the mistake of not searching for a similar product at my nearby retailers. The day after I'd ordered it I found the same thing for 5 dollars cheaper at a nearby store.Also only after a week of use the mouse pad has already started to fall apart. (The pad is begining to seperate from the gell covering.) Very poorly manufactured product.
1,Not what I expected,"Ok story if that's what you are looking for. Filming was terrible like with a video camera (intentional).If you're looking for erotica or graphic sex, there is none. If you see it for a buck used buy it otherwise no."
1,waste of time,"This was the biggest waste of time. it was incredibly boring, nothing happens. Well actually the only thing that happens is a bunch of cracked out cracked heads take a lot of bathes after shooting up. Some of you guys are thinking hmm that sounds interesting and it would have been had all the prostitutes not looked like homeless people. They all look horrible, why would I want to see that dressed, let alone naked. Anyway the main character managed to afford fake boobs and botox cause the few times she does try to smile in the movie her face doesn't move her face and body looks grotesque. Besides all that NOTHING HAPPENS!!! It is ridiculous. Oh and then her mom has sex with her haha and she doesn't care, but why would she, she is always cracked out. I think I would get more entertainment watching a REAL Documentary on crack-heads"
5,Reviewed by Beautysak.com,"An exoctic blend of lush melodic ambience and exciting percussive energy, Sungrooves' eclectic palette of jazzy instrumentation and deep house vibes offer a seductive oasis for those who want to chill and groove. This CD is a feel-good escapism the smoother side of electronica, which focuses on downtempo, house, and chillout, and sometimes incorporates Brazilian and Caribbean elements. Tastily mixed and selected by Mark Riva.- Beautysak.com"
5,"Inside America's Test Kitchen: All-New Recipes, Quick Tips,",Fascinating and instructional book. They explain not only how to prepare the recipes but WHY you use different methods. I found the comparisons of brands of foods and utensils extremely helpful.
4,not many recipes but good results,I liked the fact it didn't just tell me how to do something it told me why.While there aren't many recipes (around 30)all have turned out very well.
4,SPOILER (if you like graphic violence),"Although I'm not a big fan of the genre, this is the ONLY kung-fu movie that I know of in which no one gets injured, let alone killed. There are also no crazy, made-up, fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants weapons -- only traditional ones martial arts fans are already familiar with. Somehow, the film is at least as exciting and fun as any of the kung-fu films catering to audience bloodlust, and for this reason I would highly recommend it. There is, in fact, not even any blood in it, and if you think something like this can't possibly exist and still be fun to watch, save that judgement until you see it."
4,"Good movie, worth watching.","Lot's of action, intresting scenes at temple showing kung fu learning techniques. Good storyline. Entertaining film definately worth watching, good deal price wise."
5,A marvelous film,This is a marvelous film. Awesome fight sequences. It goes to show that you can make a quality kung fu film without wire work.
5,Amazing Film!,"This is one of the best martial arts movies of all time. Fun story with humorous moments and fights that will boggle the mind. The various match ups between different various weapons and the choreography involved is exciting to watch and a real treat for fans of weapons in general. This movie showcases plenty of cool martial arts styles and what they could look like if they were used in a battle against each other. Btw, if you love games like Soul Calibur then check out this film! It's like watching a live-action version of that game. :D"
3,Must See Live Band,"I also caught this band live (w/ J.Tull)and it turned out to be one of those rare double bills where both bands are excellent. Joe 90 Live are a powerhouse of catchy tunes, lead guy Chris Seefried reminscent of Jim Morrison by looks, and Jimmy Page by guitar. The album is significantly toned down from the live set, which is too bad, but still a fine first effort with songs like 'Drive' and 'Truth.' From the new material they played live, it sounds like their best is yet to come ('Bullet' etc.) and hopefully they will do a live album before too long. For now, see them live and bring a tape recorder."
1,Is that all there is?,"As someone who has purchased and enjoyed several other books by this author/artist, I was dismayed to find that I had, in old school vernacular, been ""sold a bill o' goods"". To categorize this pamphlet as a book is to do the consumer an injustice. I would suggest that this thin lament, albeit containing some interesting information, be considered a teaser, and one clouded with too much editorial comment, at that. I fear the author was a bit depressed when he put this tadbit of information together. I can't believe there wasn't much more information available - other sources to tap, and a brighter spin to be put on things, as well. Such a short epistle should have run as an op-ed piece in a social history journal, and not have been presented as a book."
3,almost no scent,Compared to other ayurvedic massage oils I have used this brand has almost no scent...very disappointing...all I can smell is the sesame oil...
3,Never heard of it before,I was listening to an internet radio station and heard itchy tingles album. I must say that his music is much different than most. This album is great for those who love bass and ilbient music. Even though it is repetative it overall is a good album.
4,Sun and Moon Signs,"This book is very well written, informative, and it makes it easy to find what you are looking for. Has charts for moon signs and relationship compatibility. Very interesting, I highly recomend!"
4,For Music Lovers,Very good. It has added another dimension to the scores of tracks of the greatest vocalists of a bygone era. Much better than the blathering that is currently being offered.
2,"One exchange, one return","I ordered this product for my wife before Christmas. It came in plenty of time. Upon opening and playing it we found the cd had errors so I exchanged the item for another. The exchange also had errors, so I returned it for a refund. Shipping and handling over all were great but the product itself was of poor quality"
1,Beautiful music but...,"I ordered this CD and found that the first two tracks had bad spots where the recordings skipped. I sent them back and received a replacement in short order. Unfortunitely, the same two tracks had the same errors. I returned this CD too and within a week my money was refunded. I am delighted with the way Amazon handled these multiple transactions. I am just disappointed that I wan't able to get a good copy of that CD. Maybe they're all marred in the same way."
2,Not representative of the best of her Liberty/UA years!,"Even though Vikki Carr only had 2 real hits during her Liberty/UA tenure, this budget set does not contain the highlights of that phase of her career. Where are the good songs like ""Sunday Mornin' Coming Down"",""The Lesson"",""San Francisco"",""Singing My Song"" and last but not least ""Eternity""? While these songs were not hits, they were songs that were immediately identified with Vikki and should be included in any comprehensive collection. I would recommend the British releases over this CD. Will someone please get Sony Music to re-release Vikki's English albums of the 70s on CD? Great stuff like ""One Hell Of A Woman"", ""Ms America"",""I'd Do It All Again"" and last but not least ""Six Weeks Every Summer, Christmas Every Other Year"" remain unavailable on CD!!"
4,victorious Vikki!,"This budget disc on the Curb label presents a small sampling of Vikki Carr's earlier hit recordings, including ""It Must Be Him"", and ""With Pen in Hand"".Equally enjoyable are the Broadway standards ""So in Love"", and ""Surrey With the Fringe on Top"", which Vikki performs with an energetic verve. These were staples in her nightclub act for many years. ""Bluesette"" (one of my personal favourite Vikki Carr numbers) is also happily included here.For fans of the vivacious Vikki, this disc is a very nice surprise![Curb/WEA 77677]"
5,"Man, can this woman belt it out!","I love the Merm, Barbra, Liza and Vicki. They not only belt it out, but have a great deal of emotion to go with it. Vicki Carr is amazing and if you want to hear a voice that can send chills down your spine, take a listen. Even though Vicki never made it to the Broadway stage, I say it is their loss. Cause she is right up there with the best of the Broadway belters! Good show, Vicki."
3,Interesting,"This movie was very entertaining. It showed the transformation of a little boy from Duluth, Minnesota as he turned into a cross-dresser into finally a transgendered, Goth performer. I couldn't help but feel badly for his/her wife throughout the film. It talked about her struggles to accept him/her as he/she changed and I kept thinking that the wife was remarkably patient, accepting, and maybe a bit long-suffering. It was sad to see the pair together as a young couple, apparently happy, and then later in the film to see the husband as he is now--really a performance artist without gainful employment--and the wife, middle-aged and full of insecurities about herself now that her husband is a woman."
5,My Scene Fan,"These dolls are so cool .There 100% fun to play with .Everyone should like these .I love to comb the hair because I want to do hair when I grow up .I also like to put her earrings on and bracelets and make-up ,and doing all the other cool features .You can ask my mom,I buy every one that comes out ."
1,An ugly barbie,"Ok so I brought this Fashion Fever Barbie Styling Head for my four year old daughter. She had fun doing barbies hair and putting on her make-up until the dreadful day. My 6 month old son got a hold a hair clip and well he shallowed it. We rushed to the hospital and luckly he wasnt seriously hurt but, man, I'm never buying a product like this ever again. It is a serious mattter."
5,Classic rap,"One classic album. probly the only classic album put out in the last 5 years or so. Definitely the best rap album of the modern era (2000 onwards). really every track here has a classic beat and great lyrics to listen to. his storytelling just cant be beaten.Genabis - first song, great track -- 10/10Levitibus - another great song, the music is great!! -- 9/10M-Sea-Cresy - AWESOME SONG! the sampling is classic -- 10/10No Return - BEST SONG! storytelling is AMAZING, chorus is OFF THE HOOK! -- 15/10Spartibus - another instant classic! the beat is completely dope -- 10/10Indisible - chorus sounds funny, the lyrics are classic -- 10/10Showtime at the Gallow - 9/10Psych Evaluation - on of the best -- 10/10Cemantics - yet another classic -- 9/10Poet Laureate - 2nd best song, goes for 7min and changes beat few times just gets better and better -- 10/10so there u have it, make sure u have this, its one of raps best - better than ANYTHING out there today"
5,The Ripper is at it Agian,"Wow, what can i say, i dont even have to listen to more then the first track to be able to tell that this album was goin to be blazin. Canibus the illest lyricist alive collaborates with Philli's own Stoupe, to produce probably the hottest album i have heard from Bis to this date. It use to be 2000 B.C. was the standard for incredible bis tracks but this one takes it with no effort. This album will be purchased at least 4 times, (1 for the car, 1 for the office, 1 for the house, one for the girlfriends house.) because it is worth it. Dont even bother burning this CD give this man the paper he deserves. Long Live Canibus, The Illest Alive"
4,NOT QUITE A CLASSIC IMO BUT NO SKIP SONGS EITHER,STOUPE THE ENEMY OF MANKIND is extremely nice on the boards aka his PRODUCTION/BEATS are classic usually#2 #3 #8 all = CLASICS (i)n (m)y (o)pinionbutall the rest of the songs are either good or avergae also aka NO SKIPS
4,not a classic but close,stoupe production seems to almost go perfect with canibus's ryhme style i would listen to this if you are a long time canibus fan or even someone who doesn't like rap (why is pop rap and gangsta on the tagw)
5,Excellent,"Bis' flows over ya head on this one. His lyrics are very complicated but very ill. Even if you don't comprehend them the first time you get somethin new with every listen. Solid production, A+ raps!"
5,NOBODY COMES CLOSE TO HIS EMCEE SKILLS,CANIBUS IS THE ILLEST EMCEE IN THE WORLD! THIS ALBUM PROVES THAT.PEACE TO ALL THE RIPPERS AT CANIBUS_CENTRAL
1,canibus give it up,"i thought i wrote a review on this awhile ago but since i dont see it i will write it again. this is by far one of his worst albums ever beats plain suck. and his best song the last track has one of the rawest beats i ever heard but give it up to canibus to still ruin it by changing it after 2min for a lame salsa beat or whatever it is. please avoid this garbage cd mic club was better, mic club was basically his only good album ever. if this guy had a good flow and good beats and didnt try to sound like a fake genius hed be alright cause he can rap but he sounds terrible and cant flow all he can do is mumble for along time non stop. this guy is overated"
1,garbage,"he is garbage, why do you think you never hear about him, nobody wants to listen to his scientifical garbage lyrics, words that dont even make sense, look at the titles of the tracks on the cd, that should say it all, he dont even make sense. the whole cd is garbage, his style is garbage, his flow is garbage. i tried to give him no stars but they wont let you"
5,GRISLY!,"this albums is a banger, no doubt! canibus comes off with super-inteligent lyricism while Stoupe keeps everything gelled together with his mad nice beats! go out and get this album you won't regret it, sure to sell mad units!'there was 3 taliban that was talkin' very loud, one reached in his back-side and pulled out a beretta gun, the last word i heard myself say was a four-letter one!'Canibus - No Doubt"
5,Rip TheJacker,By far his best album yet. The bad thing about it is that there are only 11 trax but every joint is tight.
5,CANIBUS RIPS THE ALBUM,canibus was amazing on this album. all the beats are just crazy and the lyrics are even hotter. he kinda brings in the 2000 B.C. style into this album woth the mic club style wich makes this album betta than every one. so all you gotta do is go and cop this album cause its worth the money
5,Splendid adventure.,Usually I don't care for pirate stories...but..Ms. Canham has the ability to take any setting and turn it into a grand adventure. Simon and Beau were great characters. I had a good time with this book.
4,Across A Moonlit Sea,A great read with good plot and even better characters. Now will have to read more by this author and hope they are as good.
4,Enjoyable Historical Romance,The characters are enjoyable set on a ship. The history of England and Spain's relationship combined in the story line bring an interesting and extra dimension. I am looking forward to reading the sequel.
5,This is the consummate pirate book!,"Oh, to be gifted with Marsha Canham's ability to spin a tale!Marsha Canham masterfully concocts an incredible cast of characters in this novel, deftly weaves in actual historical figures, presents a compelling story as she tosses her readers on board a ship bound for the high seas. . . all of this in the first chapter. And it just gets better.I would like to also say that her research was incredibly accurate. There was no twisting of fact to suit her fiction, there was an attention to detail that all other authors wish they had, and there was a genuine interest in presenting the life of a man of the sea in addition to a steamy and seductive love story. Beau and Dante are sheer magic, I must say, but it's Beau's father who steals the show.Read this book. It is a shining example of how historical fiction should be written. Marsha, please hurry up with the next one!"
5,EXQUISITE HISTORICAL ROMANCE,"Across the Moonlit Sea is an really good historical romance. It has just enough history to make it interesting without being tedious or over the top with battles and times and places. It takes place at sea for the most part and is during the time of the Spanish Amarda.The story of Beau and Dante is wonderful refreshing and alive and it make me want to be there to share the adverture. The sea battles were nicely done and kept the interest of even the most jaded romantic.Beau was a woman ahead of her time in both character and shear bravado and her foil was the equally dashing privateer Dante, who would make any girl swoon and lust for him at the same timeI think if you like this venue you can't help but like this one. I highly recommend it, for it's history, it's sexy scenes, and it pure lusty magic."
2,Dear Author:,"Nonplussed does not mean 'unruffled' or 'unconcerned' or even 'not bothered.' It means 'confused.' That's right, confused; like I am when you use 'nonplussed' inappropriately. Figure it out before you publish, please. The book was going really well for me until ""Pitt grinned, nonplussed."" Now you know."
5,An Adventure Awaits!,"Free kindle book, so why not, right? I couldn't put the book down and finished it so quickly. I'm here buying ALL the other e-books from this author. Very witty dialogue, twists and turns, and characters have depth. Simon Dante is a pirate's pirate and Beau is the atypical female lead in this genre, which is a good thing. The free book ploy worked on me and even at $3.99 is a steal for this fun read."
4,Across A Moonlit Sea,"I'll be honest...I was a bit hesitant in downloading this book onto my Kindle. There were a lot of mixed reviews that I could see. I'm glad that I gave it a chance. The prologue was enough to get you into the story, and the characters were believable for the time period. There were a few slow moments, but it was needed for character development and story progression. The romance aspects between the main characters was extremely well written and I didn't want to stop reading! It was a very good and easy read that I ended up finishing within a few hours! Waiting on the sequel and praying that it is as good!"
5,Loved this story!,"This was a very well written romance novel. Strong characters, the perfect amount of angst between the two major characters. Great plot that is cleverly written and filled with wonderous detail and action around every corner, with just enough love and passion intertwined. I love romance stories in which you practically shout ""whooo hooo"" when the two characters come together. Definite must read. I have read a couple historic romances with some sea and ship portions to the plot, but this was nearly 100% at sea and full of adventure and charm. I don't know anything about sailing, but it seems the author had a magnificent grasp of the innerworkings of a ship and its crew. Check it out! A real page turner."
4,Good read. Had me reading late into the night,Too much pirate ship details that bored me to death but otherwise a good romance. I liked it. Kept me up at night
4,Across A Moonlit Sea (Pirate Wolf series),I liked that it keeps you engaged. Just enough info about the characters so you don't forget them or become overwhelmed. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes pirate love stories.
2,too much detail- YAWN,"I bought this book because of the great reviews. I was very disappointed. I found the hero and heroine had no chemistry, the description of the sea and ships were way too detailed and boring. I really struggled to get thru the first half. I don't think I will be finishing this book. it really is a sleeper for me."
1,Terrible book,"Got this free on a digital download. The book is terribly written, plot is not good and more of a children's level."
5,Spunky,"I loved the free spirit of the heroine. She isn't just rebelling, she is a strong, independent woman who has earned the respect of the men who sail with her. It was a refreshing change from the classic ""damsel in distress"""
3,Across A Moonlit Sea,This book was ok and that is all .Dont expect to much and you will not be disapointed .It meandered along and was oh so predictable .
3,Ok story but misses the plot.,Did not meet expectations. Disappointing product over all. Just not as good as advertised. This is not a quality product.
4,Good Book,Enjoyed the book a lot. A very good read. The writer keeps you interested from biginning to end. Will buy her again
4,Exciting most the way,"Kept me interested. Never boring or longwinded. If you enjoy that kind of book, it is worth buying. Good series"
3,Romance Romance Romance...,If you are looking for a romance then look no longer. Across a moonlit sea is a light romance thatis so so. It's a good read for relaxing and kicking back on a restful afternoon.
1,What the..?,"Go to ebay and buy one of the 4 dollar programs. They work just fine. All that this comes with is a few cd's that do exactly the same thing that the 4 dollar ebay ones do, and it comes with instructions that were in JAPANESE.DO NOT BUY"
3,"Nice, not great","Good:-My son loves it and has played with it every day since we got it for him (he's 4)-It takes a beatingBad:-Cheap look and feel, but appropriate for the price-for a bank, it's small and doesn't hold many coins-it's difficult to get the coins out when you want them-Sometimes when you hit the jackpot all the coins come out, sometimes they don'tIt's not bad for what it is. I wish I had spent more money and got a bigger, better version"
4,real story,"Great story, of a full 24 hour period, with a cab driver and what he go's though out the work day."
3,Hellcab,"I just saw this film in a pile of other unknown dvds at a liquidation store. It sounds like a horror film in the vein of Bone Collector. However, this is far from what you'd expect. It's about a taxi driver who picks up various people, most of them are Hollywood stars, and they talk about problems. It's not a bad movie and it's well acted but I wish they would have choosen a different title for the movie. They also say it takes on one day which is the longest of the year but it seems days pass before the movie ends. A minor problem but it is worth watching at least once."
5,Diadem is soooo cool,"In this book, Score has to go home to Earth with Halaine and Pixle. Unfortunatly, they get caught by the cops and get taken in. Pixle has to change his skin color from blue to peach."
1,HUGELY DISAPPOINTING,"This book is a compendium of all things tacky and country. Based on the only other review of this book, I assumed it would be a cut above the average country schemed, unsophisticated fare that is so prevalent. WRONG! This book is not for people looking for a more graphic, modern take on Halloween. Instead, it regurgitates all the hackneyed, non-visionary stuff so readily available now. The designs remind me of finding bits and pieces of scraps and putting them together in the most uncompelling, hodge-podge way. If you like country, you'll probably enjoy this book. If not, I suggest you seek elsewhere..."
4,great little machine - once it starts working...,"I was able to download the software into my pc laptop and got that working. There was a problem with the laptop recognizing the scanner, however. It turns out (after a lot of hair-pulling on my part and a call to Sony - who has taken over Minolta) that I can't have anything other than the scanner plugged into the USB ports or the scanner won't work. Once I determined that, it worked great with Photoshop Elements. It scans in 5 slides at a time fairly quickly."
4,Works Great,"Bought as a presant. On a Pentium 4 it is still a little slow, but the pictures are great coming from slides."
2,A big disappointment,"There is such a huge color distortion (too much red on everything) which looks so unreal. In addition, every 1 out of 4 scans turns out extremly dark and blurry for some reason I've been unable to figure out and correct.There is no significant difference between this film scanner and other decent flatbed scanners. Like it at first but hate it now. I'm returning it."
2,Disappointment,"It only worked for a day, then I could not reload my slide anymore.And its resolution seems worse than some of cheaper flat-bed scanners, like Canon 5000F.Disappointment"
5,"High quality, affordable scans","I bought this scanner to scan some of my old slides and b/w negatives. From the beginning this scanner was just great.Setup was a snap, nice plug-n-play USB 2.0 interface. Software was easy to use. I set it up to do batch scanning and no problems. The dust removal and color correction are really useful features.But the real proof was in the prints that I made. I'd been shooting with a Canon D30 and making 8x10 and 11x14 prints for some time. But the prints from the Scan Dual III at even 11x14 were just incredible. I haven't tried larger prints, but I'm sure they will be great at least to 16x20.Trust me you won't be disappointed with this scanner. My old slides and negatives have been brought back to life!"
4,35-MM HOME SCANNING,"For a home scanner, I'm very pleased. I can process 4-slides in about 12-15 min. and do some other office work while it cranks and whistles along. Also had good tech supporrt when there was a compaaatability problem with another scanner."
5,Addicting!,"I guess the best way to describe this cd is to simply say that its addicting. Everytime I play this cd it makes me feel very happy so in essence I want more of it because of the way it makes me feel. It sends me off into a magnificent journey and It makes me forget about everything thats going on. Its just a great complilation and flows extremely well. It's very versatile as well; you have the whole 9 yards. IE. Dark, melodic, uplifting, chill trance so its takes you wherever you want to go plus the crowd does a great job of helping you get there faster. Definately goes in my top 5. There are so many angles covered in this album it's disgusting. I mean no matter what mood your in this mix has something for you. Ferry Cosrten gives us a clear reason why he's one of the best. Highly recommended!"
1,don't buy it,this is pure waste of money. The Bonus DVD is just a few minutes long and it doesn't even show footage of the concert. I was stupid to buy it.
4,Don't Listen to these People,"Certainly a great trance mix, but definitely not Ferry's best as one person mentioned. I really give this a 4.5, but I was very upset the bonus DVD isn't really a DVD at all. It's not a live show of the set, just a stagnant screen that is the album cover and you can select the tracks and play them in 5.1. It sounds great, but the advertisement is misleading.And 1 copy for $95? Are you kidding me?!?!?! I picked this up at Amoeba music 2 weeks ago (I've had it digitally for a year, I just expected a real DVD) for $6.99. And you want $90 more for a used album with 16 tracks worth of music and some 5.1 remastering on a 2nd disk? Hilarious."
2,The title,"The more I listen to it, the worse it gets, really...Ferry's style is getting too muddled. If he couldn't mix as well as he can, I'd give up on him."
3,Maybe I just don't like trance...,Or maybe I don't like trance that sounds outdated. Despite the fact that Ferry succeeds in including some good tracks and mixes it pretty well he fails in updating or improving on a sound that has already become obsolete. I know Ferry is a talented dj and producer and have heard things in the past from him that I really enjoyed but this sadly was not really one of them. 3 1/2 stars.
1,Good and Bad !,His music is nothing like tiesto just because he comes from thesame country doesnt mean sh#t.This music flows well they are teaching him to play music he likes and what the people likesno offense trying to advertise gay people which in a totallyin a wrong way .Music emotions to lead to drugs not my kind ofmusic moonshine sucks they are corrupting people in many waysIts great to have to people not competing at each other theyrespect each other to a certain point as I said money talks.
5,Great mix!!,"Ferry Corsten has been one of my favorite trance djs since I started listinging to the genre.He still is, and he probablly always will be.This cd is great!The track selection is great!And the mixing is top quality, but I wouldnt expect anything less from (System F, Goryella) Ferry himself.The only thing I did'nt like about this cd is that it was did'nt last long enough!"
3,Westwood Can do better! I've seen it!,"Don't get me wrong, I like this game. In fact I have it on the PC where it has much better graphics. The playstation version is alright but nothing special Westwood did the bare minimum. It will hold your attention if you have the patience. I just feel that it was a half effort by Westwood (Company that made this title) . I hope Westwood does not try this again with say, Tieberian Sun. Do it right the first time the way I know you can or do not do it at all. Also, multiplayer on Playstation two would be nice."
3,There are better,"Not wanting to get too much into the nuts and bolts of the game, I found the graphics a bit bland, and distinguishing between the different units quite difficult. To put it simply, if this is your sort of game, get Command & Conquer Retaliation (by the same company) - it is better in nearly all areas."
2,"If you like Dune, don't get this game","This is C&C with some Dunesque features, ported to playstation, though not as good as C&C. If you've played the other Dune games, and are a big Frank Herbert fan, you will be dissapointed by this game! It doesn't incorporate much of the plot of the book the way earlier games did, the gameplay is pretty boring, and the graphics OK, not great. If you want a strategy game, play starcraft or old C&C, this is a waste of time!"
5,Prehistory and The Hunt,"Well done, very readable, with personal experience noted from childhood onward to Phd. Wyoming Montana sites and artifacts (plus facts) not found elsewhere! Highly recommended."
5,Pilfers are Phenominal!!!!,I first saw these gus in concert in the spring of 99 and i've been in love with them ever since. If you ever get the chance to see them live i definately recomend it. Their sound is what I tell my friends is electroniska. Its such a nice mix of ska and techno in some songs. I recomend this album to anybody who likes ska or techno.
2,"Content good, book in shambles","This book was falling apart when I received it and is now in pieces. I managed to read it, but it was in such bad shape that no one can. The story itself is very interesting and I learned things about Jim Piersall that I had not known by watching Anthony Perkins movie."
5,A gripping story of courage and survival against unthinkable odds,"""Miracles on the Water"" is one of the finest accounts of man's ability--through hope, prayers, and selfless courage--to persevere in the face of terror and death. Nagorski is a master storyteller whose descriptive prose tossed me back and forth from joy to fear, to tears, to solitude, and ultimately to salvation. I felt as though I too was aboard Lifeboat #12 amid the stormy seas, and between the chapters, I increasingly wondered 'what would I have done?' More importantly, I continue to tell myself--as I suspect all readers of this powerful book will--to emulate those unforgettable 'SS City of Benares' survivors as I confront life's daily challenges, which no longer seem so daunting.""Miracles on the Water"" is wonderful, uplifting read! I look forward to more books from this first-time author."
5,A great story of survival,"This is an amazing story - even more amazing that it is true. Nagorski is a master story teller, bring this heroic tale to life. A must read."
2,Couldn't finish it,"I couldn't finish this book. I guess I didn't like the writing style. I read a lot of nonfiction and usually will trudge my way through a slower book but something about this one was uninteresting. It is a good story and heroic deeds were no doubt accomplished but there was an anticipating build-up to every detail and then no climax, the detail turned out to be mundane. I just can't read a book that attaches so much importance to every fact when the really interesting facts are given the same weight as the commonplace details."
4,Un disco muy agradable,Un CD que recoge una recopilación de éxitos muy agradables de escuchar. Son canciones sin complicaciones.
4,phenomenal,"This was a terrific album featuring many of Sawyer Brown's great hits like ""Cafe on the Corner"" and ""All These Years."" It offers a wide variety of songs and was quite good, I thought. If you are a fan of Sawyer Brown, odds are you will like this album."
4,A new side of Nevada Barr,"Having read all of Nevada's novels, I didn't expect to be surprised by her spiritual journey, but I was. It was interesting to find out how much of Anna Pidgeon's personality and personal history was based on Nevada's own and how much was very different. Her insights are very real, down to earth and unlike most spiritual guides. I didn't always agree, but she made me examine some assumptions from a new viewpoint."
3,"NOT AS GOOD AS OTHER VERNON HOWARD BOOKS, BUT IT HAS IT'S GOOD POINTS","Ok, this is the third Vernon Howard book I've read, so this review is by comparison. The Mystic Path To Cosmic Power and Esoteric Mind Power are 2 I recommend highly. This one was a published after Mr. Howard's death and appears to be taken from a recorded seminar as several passages contain the word (laughter) to indicate people are laughing.This book does get better in the last few chapters. I gave it a lower rating because the whole book could have been as good as the last few chapters as are the other VH books I've read. If you have read other books by Vernon Howard, you may want to add this to your library, if for no other reason than the chapters on True Love and dying."
3,Decently done,"This is a typical ""All you want to know"" audiobook. It's content is informative, but lacks the depth and specifics that might intrigue the more serious listeners. In the parts throughout the entire tape where actors come in and speak with specific foreign accents that fit the particular scenarios, it becomes very irritating, since these accents substantially undermines my understanding of the content, and some of them make the actors sound extremely unintelligent. No one will believe the Austrian king would speak in the way that an uneducated hobo would, but that's exactly how he sounded like."
4,Survey of the Balkan region north of Greece from early Roman times to near-present,This introductory set of tapes helped in understanding the region itself. This is an important area of the world that is difficult for outsiders to comprehend. History and geography are extremely important to the Balkan societies. The narrators in this tape presented the material in a unique way. I consider this just an introduction to the region that was so important to the Romans.
2,Laugh Track,"This 2-pack product would have been great, except a laugh track has been added, which was not part of the original editions. Canned laughter is added after every joke, which really detracts from the quality of the product. Such a shame."
3,neat but a bit pricey,"this def for a completist only as its a bit pricey (69.99) currently.one thing people should know if they want this and cannot afford it is that the it is included on the dual disc version of with teeth , on the dvd side. which is much more prevalent and allot cheaper."
1,"This book is about managing risk, not Futures","If you want to learn about futures, don't buy this book. Dr. Elder's book ""Trading for a Living"" covers risk management better in the first 3 chapters than this whole book."
1,Is Amazon asleep?,"Given that four out of the five reviews for this book are duplicates, I'd tend to favor the fifth, which wasn't very complimentary."
4,MALE MENOPAUSE,"This entry in Katz's Suburban Detective series finds Kit DeLeeuw joining a club of men who get together to chat about what's going on in their lives. As in his previous suburban novels, Katz is keen on capturing the angst of these upper class citizens. Hired by a woman to find out why her ex-husband has ceased his child support payments and contact with his kids, Kit becomes embroiled with not only a passel of suspects in suburbia, but also the Russian mob. A subplot involving Kit's newly belligerent son, Ben, is overdone and I find myself becoming more and more frustrated with Ben's actions and Kit and Jane's reactions to the surly youth. Although I enjoy the Suburban Detective series, I wish Katz would not spend so much time agonizing over his familial problems and focus more on the cases he is asked to solve."
4,A good country album,"I had never heard of Boy Howdy before I acquired this album. And it's a pretty good album in the traditional country style and has good songs. The 12 page booklet includes all lyrics and some photos. If you are a country fan and enjoy artists such as John Michael Montgomery and the like, then you will enjoy this album. They do a good cover on this album of Still's ""Love the one you're with""."
4,One of the best covers comps in awhile ...,"There are some very interesting versions of Pavement songs on this comp. Either Pavement is very prolific (which they are) or lots and lots of people wanted to cover them, hence the 2 CD set. It doesn't disappoint. Even if you aren't a Pavement fan there is enough different styles of music on this comp to make it worthwhile. There is country (Silkworm), experimental (Truman's Water), etc.As a fan of covers and Pavement, I highly recommend this comp. The songs are diverse and interesting. My only complaint is the Solex cover of ""Shady Lane"". I personally think it is unlistenable, but that's just me. Skip it and listen to the rest."
4,solid album,"Yungstar is a very talented rapper. His lyrics are tight and flow together well. The album is pretty good but my main complaint is that Yungstar himself doesn't rap enough on this album. He has too many people featured in too many songs. Bottomline is if your a fan of his past albums pick this one up. If not pick up ""Throwed Yung Playa"" and listen to some tight lyrics on songs like ""knocking pictures of da wall"" and ""I'm still a baller."""
5,excellent item,this is a must have item for any deer hunter or rifle shooter without this item when your faced with into the sun shoots your scope can become glared by the sun however with this item equipped you can look directly into the sun with no problem.
5,CANVAS SLIP-ONS,The shoes are of very good quality & are holding up well. I wear them 3-4 times a week. Because of my job I am on my feet all day & these slip-ons are very comfortable.
2,Looks cute but ill-fitting,"I had never tried Grasshoppers shoes before, and I had been wanting flat shoes for everyday wear instead of just tennis shoes as I often do.However, these were not true to size for me. I'm normally a 7.5 W, but these were too big and would not stay on my feet snugly. Aside from sizing, I did not find these shoes to be all that comfortable. I had also tried a skimmer by Grasshoppers.....that was even more uncomfortable than this model.In all, I've been completely turned off of Grasshoppers. Although the styles are not as youthful, if you look around Naturalizers are just a bit more expensive and a lot more comfortable."
2,Cooks Too Hot,"I finally had to retire the crockpot I had been using for 15 years, and received this set for Christmas. I have used the large cooker several times now. I would never leave anything cooking in it while I left the house as the only setting that doesn't bring the food to a lid-rattling boil is the warm setting."
2,Slow cooking?,If you want to cook a meal while away at work then you need to work half days. This thing has a low temp that is way too high for slow cooking. Sorry I bought it.
1,Fast Cooker,"I received the Rival as a gift. This slow cooker is anything but slow. On the low setting, a 3 lb pot roast was over done in less than 2 hours. Instead of slow cooking you are slow boiling. I ruined a few meals with this crock pot and now I am looking to buy a new one."
1,Unsafe and useless,"The coocker gets very hot and burns the food. Especially if you leave it on ""warm"" setting after the time is up. The food continues boiling . I called the customer service and was told that for their new models whatever the time needed should be divided by 2 (e.g if the recipe calls for 10 hrs, set the unit to 5). This makes the cooker completely useless as I planned to use it at night or when I at work. I searched the web and it seems to be a common problem for Rival crock pots. Don't waste your money on Rival."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this crock pot trusting the Rival name but this was a big mistake!!! I have only used it 3 times since I bought it 2 years ago. Reason being every time I tried to slow cook on low it cooked way to fast and way too hot ruining my meals each time!!! Such a disappointment!!! I went out today and bought a new one, hopefully this one will be better!!! Bought the Crock Pot touch screen which has great reviews!"
3,Massive - Buy only if you have a large family,"The case of the Goldilocks and the 3 Bears...My first crock pot was only 2 Quarts and was too small... I dreamed of a big one to cook large meals in....I was extremely excited to order this 6 1/2 quart one, especially since it came with the little dipper for parties...This one was too large. It is massive. Not only does it take up too much room in my house but it is too large when cooking for a family of four...I had to buy a 4 1/2 quart crock pot. Much better size.If the size is right for you. It work great but I feel even the low setting is a bit hot. I wish it work more like a oven knob where you can adjust the temp along a dial / spectrum of temperatures."
2,Too Hot,"I want to add my voice to those who say this crock-pot's low setting is too high. It boils a full load after several hours of cooking. There is no real difference between the low and high settings.A second, lesser problem involves the lid. It doesn't seal the contents very well when locked down. Expects a mess if you take this in your car. Coming from a Hamilton Beach that had both a proper low setting and a decent sealing lid, the Rival is a real disappointment.The bonus, ""Little Dipper"" pot is a slow cooker with one setting (high), and no on-off switch. It works, but is quite limited."
1,CrockPotBrandCrocksSuck,"Same thing happened to me as many. Side handles broke off, lid handle broke off. I almost scalded my dog and myself when the side handle broke while lifting. Still continued to use it but couldn't lift it. Next the lid handle broke. Continued using with extreme difficulty since the lid was on backorder through Rival replacement parts (hmm, I bet you can guess why). Next the other side handle broke. Crockpot/Rival should be ashamed. They should also be paying me for the hazard they subjected my entire family to for their decision to employ cheap parts and poor construction made in China. When I get a chance, I'll add a picture as proof and what you can expect from this shoddy kitchen appliance. Oh you should know, it's barely 2 years old and been out of commission for a month."
3,"Works OK, Could Be Better","I have had a smaller Rival crock pot for about 15 years. I was happy with it and it still works fine but I wanted a bigger one.This one works OK. However there seems to be very little difference in heating between the low and high setting on this larger pot. Compared to the old one, the ""low"" setting is much hotter. It boils vigorously on the ""low"" setting. Food is always vastly overcooked if I leave it all day. Kind of defeats the purpose of how I like to use a ""slow cooker"".If you use low setting and just leave it 4 hours or so most food is cooked about right, which is how the old one works when on the ""high"" setting. Makes me wonder if the people who designed this ever took one home and used it.On the positive side, it was inexpensive. Crock is a bit large to clean in the sink, I take it outside on a wood table. It cleans easily using a non-metallic Scotch-Brite pad and the garden hose."
2,This one's a winner (while it lasted)!,"I recently purchased this Rival crockpot after buying a Crofton (piece of junk). This crockpot is affordable, if you are looking for a no frills crockpot.Update: 5/2012 - The rubber feet on the bottom fell off about a year ago, I kept them in the bottom of the crock so they don't get lost :( Recently, while washing the crockpot I noticed the whole bottom is cracked through and through! Therefore, I have changed my rating of this product to a 2. It was good while it lasted and I used it approximately 1-2 month."
1,Donate or Throw Away?,"I'm editing this review because I called Rival and told them about my problem (see below). They said they would replace my crock pot with the same model and there was no hassle! I'm not sure I want the same model but thought they had great customer service.Previous Post: ""My HIGH setting broke in my 5th or 6th use and it only cooks on low - so I need to devote 8-10 hours to my meal instead of 3 or 4. And for me, the low cooks very low - even after cooking overnight. So it's back to the reviews to find a more reliable slow cooker.""The reviews look good for the Rival 6 quart Versaware and Rival Customer Service said that its their most popular and reliable crock pot. I may buy that one next if my replacement poops out on me too."
1,Don't buy Rival Crock Pots!,"I had my Rival Crock Pot for only 5 years. The handle on the lid broke because where the screw goes in, the plastic had melted. When I tried to contact customer service to get a new lid, they told me the only thing I could do was buy a whole new unit. Thanks for nothing Rival! I will NOT buy your products again!"
3,LUV LUV LUV BUT....,"I love Crock pots. Bought this one after base on other one cracked after 20+ years. I don't notice a problem with the overcooking, but maybe I'm just used to it by now. BUT... last night I noticed that the handles on this one are cracking apart and off after less that 2 years of owning. Called Rival/Jardin to see what they would do and the whole thing is only covered by a 1 year warranty. BUMMER. Thing works fine still, but I can see it's going to be handle-less within a year or two."
2,"Runs Hot, No Replacement Parts","As others have said, the pot runs very hot. Unfortunately, the ceramic stoneware cracked and Rival does not offer it as a replacement part. I'm going to purchase a different brand for a replacement."
1,No control!,"The first time I used this Rival slow cooker, food that was supposed to cook for eight hours was overdone and inedible after two hours. I lost the receipt and could not return it. Lesson learned; if you buy this item, beware of first time use and hang on to the return slip!"
5,Fantastic Kitchen Aide,"I love this Slow Cooker. My friend recommended it to me about three years ago but the only thing I cooked in it was whole chickens. Then I moved to SD and my mother-in-law showed me how to use it for EVERYTHING. Now I cook roasts, steaks, sooups, and even spaghetti in this thing. It's a time saver! And so easy to clean up."
1,Low setting is WAY to hot!!!,"Rival 64451LD-C 6.5 Quart Slow Cooker with Bonus Little Dipper Slow CookerI've used this a couple of times and each time it cooked food way to fast. Recipes that were supposed to take 4-6 hours were done in 1 hour! I lost my receipt, but if I had it, I would return this ""slow"" cooker. It's terrible. I had used older slower cookers and they worked fine...don't know why they changed them."
5,Happy with this purchase,"I just had to replace my old FarberWare slow cooker with this new Rival 6.5 Qt crockpot. This slow cooker has not given me any problems and is very similar to my last one. I have used it a dozen times now and my sauces, chilis, soups, etc. have cooked to perfection.I highly recommend this slow cooker."
4,Has worked for everythign I put it through,"I have used this slow cooker for many different recipes, and they have all turned out great. The build of it does feel a little cheap, but the results are great. Great slow cooker at this price point. Also comes with a smaller slow cooker, but I have not sued that."
1,Buy another pot,"I bought this cooker several weeks ago, tried several meals, and it is truly a slow cooker, or maybe, a very slow warmer. Unless one has endless patience, look for another brand. I threw it out rather than give it to Goodwill and let some other person experience the frustration of endlessly waiting for food to cook."
1,The most terrible crock-pot ever!,"I received this as a wedding gift, after years of using a less expensive model. It burns everything! I have doubled recipes, thinking that would help- it doesn't. It boils even on the keep warm setting, and every time we use it we come home to charcoal. I am throwing it away right now!"
2,Check The Stoneware Insert....,I purchased this crockpot at a local store several months ago and have used it only 3-4 times. I was not too happy with it as the stoneware insert was so heavy but overall it seemed to cook items okay. I was washing the insert tonight and noticed a crack running across the bottom so I doubt I'll be using it again for fear it will break. I've always been very careful with the insert and washed it by hand instead of it going in the dishwasher so I'm really disappointed in the product.
1,Rival Crock Pot Handles Break,"We have this model Rival Crock Pot. Both side handles disintegrated and came off in pieces while cooking. A quick internet search shows that this is a common complaint of nearly all Rival Crock Pot models. Some are subject to a recall for this problem because customers have been burned. This model is NOT in the recall, the handles cannot be replaced.In addition, we have noticed that the temperature setting is too high and it would burn food even on low. Very dissatisfied with this product."
5,Ideal Crockpot,"Rival 64451LD 6.5 Quart Slow Cooker with Bonus Little Dipper Slow Cooker IS MORE THAN I EXPECTED! Fang Cai, my acupuncturist, urged me to get a crockpot to boil bones for bone marrow broth but cautioned that her's tended to over flow, so she said to be prepared by placing rags under the cooker. No overflow with our Rival--even with the water level at the brim! And it is so easy to use and handle that even my hard-to-please wife loves it. Lastly, washing is a breeze! P,S. The Bonus Little Dipper Slow Cooker is perfect for my single daughter, Shereen Saiki, who is also our acupuncturist."
5,Love this Crock-Pot!,"I've owned this Crock-Pot for about 6 years, and I use it HARD! We have a family of 6, plus I use it to cook roasts and such for branding crews. I can put my ingredients in, go out and brand all day, and when our hungry crew comes in to eat, the meal is consistently ready, exactly as I expected. I came to this site to order a replacement part... not the fault of the crock pot. I put my cold liner on a hot stove, and it cracked. 100% pilot error. Just thought I needed to counter-act some of the negative reviews I saw here. I love this crock-pot."
2,Flimsy knob makes for errors in temp setting,Worked great until...One day turned the knob to low and came home to cold raw chicken. Somehow the unit inside didn't go to low but instead went off (even though unit plugged in and the little knob pointed to low). So irked that I'm tossing it. Not risking wasting anymore food if the little knob is that flimsy and unreliable.
2,not what i ask for,Over all it does do the job but you will end up with a clear one BOOOOOO so if you are trying to mod your PC this is not the one for you.
5,Not to be missed if you are a Dodger fan!,"This is a trip down memory lane that is not to be missed. Even if you are not a dyed in the wool Dodger fan, this DVD will re-visit the days of Kofax and Company with great relish. Those are the days when ballplayers played with great intensity and didn't worry about their bank account or endorsements. The game was all that mattered and it shows."
2,Rich Creamy Paint is disappointing,"Rich Creamy Paint is a disappointing CD, with slow, boring songs that sound a bit like a distorted version of Weezer. I would not recommend this CD to anyone."
5,"New insights on the ""Neolithic Revolution""","I loved it! What a treat to find a truly original - and radically controversial - idea backed up by solid scholarship. This elegantly written book owes its existence to the fact that the author refused to dismiss the accounts of ancient Greek and Roman historians (Pliny, Eudoxus, Xanthus, Plutarch) that mention Zarathustra and place his life thousands of years before conventional estimates. Armed with new information made possible by advanced archaeological techniques, Settegast makes a compelling case for linking one of the great puzzles of Neolithic archaeology - the ""sudden and irrevocable diffusion of the agricultural way of life"" - with the simultaneous spread of Zarathustra's religious imperative emphasizing the role of farming in the religious life. A fascinating read."
5,Hearth and Home Celebration,"This dinner set is glorious! It conjures up visions of Harvest-time family dinners giving thanks for all the bounty on these plates. The colors are pleasing and clear without being garish at all. The true tones in the turkey and foliage will compliment any Thanksgiving de`cor, allowing the use of almost any color palate.The shape of the cups and the ridged edges of the plates are festive and well done.This set is a winner! And you will not go wrong setting your table this holiday season with this ""sure to become an heirloom"" Churchill China set."
5,Inspiracion para aumentar mi coleccion.,Esta fue una de mis primeras figuras y quizas la razon para que mi coleccion ahora sea tan grande.Cada detalle es perfecto es una de las pocas que se decir que no se le cambiaria nada.El hecho de que Max Factory sea el que la produce es otra garantia. Espectacular totalmente recomendada.
5,"Beautiful, poignant and hilarious","The first 15 minutes of the movie when nothing was happening except for Veikko trying to free himself, we both throught that it was a boring and colorless movie. The rest of it we were literally falling off the sofa, so funny it was. The sheer premise of putting 3 people with different languages and different agendas in the same setting was beautifully explored here. The scene where Anni tries to bring Veikko back to life is rather eerie, but so gorgeously shot! I recommend this film to anyone who is sick and tired of Hollywood blockbusters made for the cheap audience. This movie is rich in spirit and will leave you smiling for a long time"
4,Amusing and Pointed,"I do not understand Russian, Finnish, or Sapmi, but this movie was entertaining, amusing, and insightful about human communication and values. Also a good anti-war movie. Perhaps a little more language skills and it would have been a 5 in my book."
5,SUPERIOR,If you like a very strange story about very strange people told in a very strange way this is the movie for you. I like it a lot
4,Very happy with my purchase.,"Scarf was exactly as described. Feels warm and comfortable. The real test is when the temperature drops further. The stitching is good quality. Nothing about it feels cheap. The scarf is thin, but that is expected of Polyester Fleece. It also arrived 4 days before expected delivery date."
3,Still a good read,"I used to read these to my children, and now to my grandchildren. They still hold the children's attention after all these years."
4,Timba A La Boriqua,"Wow! It's hard to believe that that this CD is 5 years old. It's an great example of timba done by non-Cubans. I for one don't believe that it has to be done by Cubans. La PVC takes the style and runs with it. It definitely has a different feel than most of the stuff that comes from Cuba. I think it has more jazz overtones than that stuff, but that's OK. It's kind of like their own interpretation. In ways it's similar to the style of timba done by la Timba Loca aka La Clave Secreta, but with a more timba feel, if that makes any sense. It's kind of hard to describe. While it's all well done I only give it 4 stars because there is nothing outstanding. That's still OK. I will take a CD with a bunch of well done songs over a CD with one high profile song and a bunch of crap. I'm eagerly awaiting the next CD, if there is a next one."
1,Waste of time.,"The first review I read here sums it up nicely:""Frozen Fire strings you along with an erratic mystery that could never really make any complete sense and then offers no explanation at the end.""Mystery is fine in a book. Leaving unanswered questions can be genius. But not this time. This simply doesn't make sense and was a total waste of my time. I'm taking my daughter out for a different book so she doesn't have to waste her time on this."
4,Good Read for Young Suspense Readers,"Tim Bowler lays out an intriguing mystery. He yanks you into the story with the very first words and compels the reader to continue into the story as Dusty herself is pulled into the mystery of ""The Boy"" and the brightness. Although the tale is interesting, Bowler's supporting characters are sometimes unbelievable, particularly Dusty's parents who seem to have had a role reversal with her. One word of caution for readers who like neat conclusions: although Dusty does learn the fate of her missing brother, she does not uncover any information about ""The Boy"" or the greater mystery of the brightness that seems to take her over at times. What is going on with that?"
2,Really?,"I had never read one of Bowler's novels and after this one probably won't read any others. I felt strung along in this vague, rather than suspenseful mystery, that then was abruptly ended with a confusing resolution, with no real explanation. I found the excessive British terminology to be distracting as well. I would not reccomend this book to anyone. There are too many good reads out there to waste your time on this one."
3,frozen fire leaves me cold,"Frozen Fire is well written and a good read, but I didn't love it. Without giving away any of what the dust cover claims is a mystery, the result of the mysterious boy who shows up in Dusty's life was a bit strange to me. I read lots of fantasy and some supernatural and sci-fi, but this was a concept I could not heartily embrace. Just a little weird for me. Not what I expected; which can be a really nice thing from a book, but Frozen Fire didn't work wonders on my mind or heart."
5,Frozen Fire - Best Book Ever,"Tim Bowler has written one of the best books that I have ever seen. Frozen Fire is definetly one that you could not stop reading. This philosiphical thriller keeps you reading on, and after reading do you realize how much you have learnt. If you like books from Mitch Albom and Dan Brown, think of this as a combination of their best works. Overall, I think this is a book where you truly should expect the unexpected."
3,3.5 stars could have been better,This is a great video collection but there is one HUGE problem. The videos are censored. There is a parental advisory sign on the cover. But it only applies to the bonus CD. I am disappointed that the videos are censored
3,"what is wrong with J. P. G. Cox ""jpgm""?","great oracle. read the biased J. P. G. Cox ""jpgm"" then judge for yourself...we don't need more self-righteous, negative critiques...hey amazon! the review by J. P. G. Cox ""jpgm"" doesn't help sell this book you offer...think about that. IN LA'CHECH"
1,Don't waste your money,"The case is not so good. It is open at the top and bottom. There is a velcro strip inside so if you put the other side of velcro (not supplied) on your PDA, it won't fall out.The 4-1 stylus sucks. It is hard to get out what you want. It is hit or miss on twisting the clicker and pusing in. I usually get the black pen. It takes many tries to get the stylus point or the pencil.The kit includes 10 protector sheets all for different PDA models. Some are pretty similar, so you might be able to get 6 for your PDA. But not likely.There is nothing I like about this Kit."
2,You can find something better,The quality of materials is poor (even for the price) The pen is the worst of it. I got a pen (not like the one that is on the ilustration) that is only 2 in one (black pen and stylus).
3,Not What I Expected!,"When I watched the first season of ""Hazel"" I was pleasently surprised with how good the episodes really were. I barely remember this show from my childhood, but the characters are likeable and the writing very good. The black and white resolution was also excellent. BUT when I received Season 2, the shows are in uneven color, the prints are not consistently clean, and there is no laugh track. I realize you don't need a laugh track to tell you when to laugh, but I like to watch these shows as they were originally presented. The Lucy Show's sharp and brilliant color has spoiled me. Hazel just hasn't been as well preserved as Lucy!!!"
5,How could anyone ever get tired of Hazel?,"Season two of Hazel is just a good as anyone could ever expect. It's a true classic early American sitcom. Easy to watch, great story lines and family friendly by all means. And with a regular cast of characters, and some which became big stars, you can't go wrong. This is well worth the money you will spend on it, and worth watching again and again. You can feel confident with this purchase.The Shout Factory did a great job with putting this on DVD."
5,HAZEL - Season 2,"Although I consider the first season of the HAZEL TV show as having the best episodes, the second season was pretty good. It's got some pretty good shows with Mr. Griffith and the Johnsons. It's a good wholesome show for the whole family."
5,"Thank you, thank you, thank you","I am so glad that the second season is being released and can not wait for more. I loved ""Hazel"" and have waited for so long for another one to be forthcoming. Now if the ""powers that be"" would get the other seasons out sooner than it took this one, it would be fabulous."
5,Hazel and her boobs!!!!!,"Yay- They're finally all coming to dvd. l say this because Shirley Boothe obviously never wore a bra and her thing thangs looked like they may as well have been drooping down to the floor! And then theres that face, with the crossed eyes! lol- But she was a real peach- the dream maid anyone would want! l loved season one and am so looking forward to season 2.....But Shirley? I sho' hope you discovered bras by season2!"
1,No subtitles = ONE STAR,"My one-star rating is only due to the fact that this season is NOT CAPTIONED. Other factors are taken into consideration that determine how many stars are given, such as story lines, characters, set designs, eye appeal, etc. but none of them matter at all to me if I cannot understand the lines. I'm hard of hearing and it's difficult for me to understand the first time, so I'm not going to spend hours on end trying to understand the spoken dialogues included. I have more important things to do.I am beyond appalled with Shout!'s decision to leave out the subtitles. Re-release the set WITH English captions/subtitles, and I'll order it, come back and change my rating with what may be a better review. Thank you."
5,A marvelous and vintage coincidence,"Bobby Buntrock....(Harold BAXTER & I have the same first name and the same age).I grew up watching this series. every time it was on, i was there to see this special time with Hazel....we had a very beloved cousin named Hazel also.........I viewed this on a Philco Blck & White TV console....a 1953 model....with Rabbit ears on the top of it for good reception....we had 2 clear channels then....this was the great Sixties....our country was a different place in History then, solvent and secure. Schools were extremely SAFE, and everyone went to Church....Mothers were at home mostly with children, and Christmas was Magical. The Times were of Honesty and Faith with one another....an inborn respect for each other, as was intended by our father and God......"
2,Shame on Shout! Factory,"After purchasing Season 1 of Hazel and thoroughly enjoying my discovery of this classic sitcom, I purchased season 2 only to find it is not subtitled or close-captioned for hearing impaired viewers like myself.I notice that Sony company actually released season 1 which does include close captions, and I couldn't wait to begin watching the following season, especially since it's in color.Why Shout! Factory decided to forgo this important option to MANY viewers is beyond me. It's also quite upsetting that I am unable to watch these 32 color episodes i've been anticipating so much. Well, I can technically watch them, but i'd really have no idea what the heck was going on without captions or subtitles.Thanks Shout! Factory, for making Hazel inaccessible to this viewer. Hopefully someone important in the company will come across this review and be kind enough to add them in for the season 3 release."
3,plastic emotions,"I finished the book, but wasn't ""wowed"" by it. It felt like I still wasn't getting the ""real"" Hope, but a glossy, superficial version. She openly describes her obsessions, compulsions, and the dynamics behind them, but it just doesn't connect on a visceral, emotional level. It feels stilted and plastic. It's an interesting memoir, but not memorable."
3,How Much is Nonfiction?,"The book is entertaining enough and a very easy read, but I immediately wondered why there were no pictures. It's very odd, since the book is all about the search for physical perfection. The book references photos, but doesn't include any. The author claims to have been extremely beautiful, yet found flaws in herself and turned to plastic surgery."
4,One more surgery and then I'll be happy,"The book does give a good insight to how one can get caught up in ""the just one one more surgery and then I'll be happy cycle.At one point she says to her plastic surgeon ""I've decided to get my breasts done"" he said ""great uh, bigger of smaller?"" obviously she didn't need anything done."
1,boring,This book is boring and slow. There is nothing compelling. It doesn't grip you in any way. Didn't finish it.
1,A Retread of Every Other Book She's Ever Written,"Basically, if you've ever read a Kelsey Roberts book, you don't need to bother with this one. I'm not allowed to say why. It's just another variation on a formula, as Roberts delivers two people for whom arguing means true love. Uh-huh. In a lot of ways, it doesn't even seem like their story, since the supporting cast takes up so much of the time. Throw in an underdeveloped plot, an easy-to-solve mystery and a confusing climax, and I have a hard time understanding why this book is so popular. In the end, Roberts seems to have realized she hit her word limit and could stop, so she didn't bother to make things too clear. Her first book, ""Legal Tender"" was excellent, and I thought she would become one of my favorite writers, but ever since, she's gotten complacent. The characters have some good repartee, but I really didn't buy this book just for a few good lines."
1,Gotz Aquini Potty Doll,I am very dissatisfied with this doll. The doll is hard to fill with water and the water runs right back out. There's no plug or anything to keep the water from running out of the doll. So you have no time to teach your child to teach the doll how to potty.
2,Leaky trainer,"This was a real disappointment. I bought the girl doll (received the boy doll) as a potty training aid for our daughter. The doll leaks as soon as you squirt the water in, so it is difficult to have your child teach the doll to pee in the potty unless you balance it on the little potty. The head was also caved in on one side."
1,Glitzy Belt?,"The photo of this belt makes it look very heavy and chocked full of rhinestines----BUT IT IS NOT!!!!It is a stretchy belt made with lightweight plastic beads that aren't even good rhinestone fakes!I was very disappointed when I received it, but I didn't want to mess with sending it back. I will get a larger more detailed description next time, before I buy!"
1,EA doesn't care.,"Alright, now I know they put all sorts of effort in to the Xbox 360 version and the game is fantastic. The Xbox and PS2 versions were put together as afterthoughts however. They are terrible. For instance, you can heal any cut on your boxer in the 360 version and the commentary says things about it. In the Xbox and PS2 version you can't and they haven't even taken out the commentary about cuts that you can't heal. It can't get any more simple than that. The A.I. is unrealistic and practicing against it isn't going to make you fight another person in vs. any better. Simple things like being able to preview items you have to press a button for and then you can't even rotate your boxer to see what it looks like. It's very evident that they didn't care about these versions. In fact there's less content than there is in Fight Night Round 2. If you're looking for a good boxing game look back to the last game for a much cheaper price tag."
4,KO Mohammad Ali !!,"This game is great fun, high on adreline, good graphics and the best of all, lands your punch like no other :) Among the highlights, I loved the ESPN Classics where you can relive the greatest boxing rivalries that existed in the world. By taking on the role of a previous champ, you get to play his moves! For instance, Ali is nimble, has stamina etc. while Frazier has deadly power behind his punches. But ofcourse, the main highlight of the game is the career mode, where you get to create your own boxer and make him a champ in any weight class! The game has amazing punch control and is extremely addictive. On the negative side, it lost charm after 40+ fights - coz most of my rivals had better physical fitness ratings than my boxer :( Overall, highly recommended - you will love it till you get tired of it."
1,Unbalanced,"The title says it all. the new haymakers are far too powerfull, landing ONE is enogh to put your oppenent in danger, even with full life and stamina. this game is all sizzle and no steak.....boring. FN-R2 is way better"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,It will ruin your TV. The fights are displayed only in widescreen and can not be changed. The fight action is very slow paced. Worst game ever played. I had to return it. I thought EA would do better on this game.
2,This Movie Sucked in a Sucky Way!,"After stumbling across the unforgettable ""Oh God, oh man!"" YouTube sensation of a clip, I bought this movie hoping for a delightfully awful cinematic experience a la ""Troll 2"" or ""The Room.""No such luck!Sure, the acting was terrible and there are some undoubtedly clunky lines, but overall, this movie wasn't awesomely bad, just DOWNRIGHT bad. Luckily, I only paid $3.50 for it, and was able to score back another $2 at the used bookstore. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was because of the ""Oh God, oh man"" scene, so kickassedly inept it warrants a star on its own.Bottom line? Awesomely bad movie fans will likely be disappointed by this one. Stick to YouTube for your ""Tough Guys"" clip fix--at least it's free!"
1,To Hell and the Hamptons,"The 1950's bio-pic of Mailers ""greatest generation"" book The Naked and the Dead was spared his own ham handed directorial savoir faire, a mercy denied here."
1,The New York Times Book Review,"NORMAN MAILER IS THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS MOVIE, A FAVORITE AMONG THE EAST COAST LITERARY ESTABLISMENT'S COCKTAIL PARTY CROWD. FROM HIS NOVEL. THE REST OF HIS BOOKS WILL BE AS OBSCURE AS THIS MOVIE IN A FEW YEARS."
3,"Oh God, Oh Man, Oh God, Oh Man","Oh God, Oh Man, Oh God, Oh Man, Oh God...If you can find this movie, watch it simply for the laughs and don't expect to get anything else from it. Might I add that the source material for this movie, Norman Mailer's novel of the same name, isn't a whole lot better. I don't even think it's in print anymore.May we inter this farce to the ground. In God's name we pray, amen."
1,Mine was missing a chapter!!!,"Like Theodore, I did everything possible to afford this book. When selling my plasma led me nowhere, I was forced to become a drug mule :(Eventually I downloaded it on my Kindle, and was rather disappointed. I am not able to melt things with my eyes, but the telekinesis powers that Theodore mentioned were nowhere to be found. I then noticed my book did not fully download, and that I was missing that chapter. Mega bummer."
1,I ask. Who pays him to write books?,"Dont buy the book if u want to learn programming in VB.NET. Find someother book.Do buy the book if you want to curse cry and see how fast you can drop OOP in VB.NetI know this is an advanced book, but come on is this for MIT PH.d's.?This book is book is basically structured like this:""You will do this and do that and all sorts of OO concepts""When in actuallity u will be typing hours of lines of code and in the end feel like u gained nothing from it.Please college professors lecturers CS, CIS, CE, IT, MIS DEPT directors please dont order this book. OR dont put ur students through this."
5,The best Commander Cody album,What a great album. I wore my LP out back in the 70s 80s. I downloaded the MP3s of the whole album for 10 bucks. A great deal in my opinion.
3,Jackie O wig,"The hair ended up being longer than the normal Jackie O look and didn't really have a part in the hair. However, price was decent and the hair flip was maintained even through packaging!"
3,50's wig,"The wig feels nice has nice shiny hair, but when it came it was a little messed and when I put it on and brushed it the flip went partly out of it. I tried to use a curling iron and hair spray on it to make it curl back up, but it wouldn't hold. Plus once I brushed it one side was about 5 inches longer than the other. So I had to cute it to match. It still has a small flip to it and looks nice, so I will still use it. It's only a Halloween costume I bought if for."
5,A Fine Comedian!!!,"Augie T. is the hottest rising star in comedy today. He has what it takes to make it world wide -- meaning the ability to make the audience laugh. REALLY laugh! That healing belly laugh that just shakes away all your cares and releases any tension is what this dvd produces. I saw the show and enjoyed it so much, I got the dvd right there and watched it as soon as I got home! He is just so funny! Augie T.'s comparison between the local Hawaiian guys (mokes) and midwestern guys is so dead-on accurate! I grew up in the midwest and now live in Hawaii--that really hit home! Do yourself a favor and buy this dvd; it has universal appeal. You will not be disappointed. It is good, clean, healing fun!"
3,Definatly NOT Satisfied,"Well when I bought this game I thaught it would rock, Be Fantastic as Many Titles Of EA Games are. But really i am not very happy with it.... It starts cool you can create your own fighter or use A Famous Boxer. Like Ali. But then it all goes down hill. There is, well lets see Only 1 soundtrack to this game. And its A RAP song, Obviously. Ok so now you start playing. The load times aren't that bad maby 30-45 seconds. Once you in the game the graphics are pretty good. But the Commentry is terrable. The Anouncers Must be preset to only 2 fighter names, And there is a lag between the punch and the comentator commenting on it. Sometimes i find the game freezes for a second. But they are few and far between. The game becomes tiresome as once you become the champ, The Number 1. You have to defend the title constently and you keep playing the same contestents. I would not even give this game a second glance. I found it boring ...."
2,Not suitable for PSP,"I had Round 2 for the PS2 and loved that game. While this is a great game, it is simply not playable on the PSP. The learning curve is seemingly shallow at first, and then you hit a wall and cannot progress further. You cannot win the big fights without being able to throw haymakers at the right time, and throwing haymakers are nearly impossible with the controlls set up for the PSP. While this is a fun, addicting game, and well-made, it is not suitable for the PSP, and they should not have released it.I look forward to playing it on other platforms, but if I were you, I would steer clear of this one on PSP."
3,Good But Not All That,"THIS GAME IS KINDDA FUN BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. I RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS GAME USED AND I DONT KNOW IF ITS THE GAME OR WHAT? BUT THE LOADING TIMES ARE TO LONG, WAY LONG. NOT JUST LOADING TIMES AS SOON AS U PUT THE UMD IN, LOADING TIMES BETWEEN ROUNDS AND LOADING TIMES BETWEEN CHOOSING A FIGHTER. IT SEEMS LIKE THE GAME LOCKS UP FOR MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS WHEN U SCROLL FROM FIGHTER TO FIGHTER AND WHEN U SCROLL FROM THE DIFFERENT GEAR WHEN CREATING A FIGHTER. IT TAKES ME LIKE ABOUT 5 MINUTES TO ACTUALLY START A MATCH FROM THE MOMENT I INSERT THE DISC, TURN ON THE PSP AND SO ON. IF U REALLY WANT TO AVOID FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE LOADING TIMES DONT GET THIS GAME AND INSTEAD PLAY SUPER PUNCH OUT FOR THE SUPER NES OR MIKE TYSONS PUNCH OUT FOR NES, NONE OF THESE HAVE LOADING TIMES."
3,"Easy game, fast replace","This game have very good boxers but it is very easy, you will continuining fighting with the same guys and just have to beat them with the haymaker. I just used that game for 1 month and replace it with buying a new one. If you want a boxing one, just for your collection, then i recommend you, it has the faces of legends in boxing."
4,"Great Game, Dont like Analog Botton!!!","Great Gameplay and graphics.The only Problem(at least for me) is that you must use the Analog Button to move your fighter Around, instead of giving you the option of using the traditional Directional Buttons like on the xbox. and that leaves my left thumb sore after hours of gameplay."
4,Awesome game,This game provided me hours of fun on deployment. It isn't the most difficult game to play but the graphics were very good.
3,this is not a typical Drum n'bass music.,"i always intrigued by the idea of living human play all kind of parts by real instruments in electronic music.that was the first reason i hooked up with breakbeat era,...and they blend the tightness of computerized instrument with the aggresiveness of homosapien's instinct.i got a record of them performing live in new york,and their live performance is also incredible."
4,"Strong, scary and almost great","The drum-n-bass on this CD stalks you, with unforgiving basslines, tight production and beats that cut your gums with their speed. The most impressive thing about this CD, however, are the organic elements; the infusion of the vocals throughout the beats and madness. Most artists who've tried to do this simply have looped/banged out vocals scattered here and there and you aren't sure if the singer actually heard the song or got sampled into the mix afterwards. NOT on THIS CD. The vocals are part-and-parcel of the songs and to grand effect. Like good, first-album Portishead, but about ten times as fast. A strong, almost classic record marred by the occasional beat that we've heard once too often. Definitely for fans...but way too fast for first-timers or the occasional listener. May snap the necks of house cats as well."
4,Great drum'n'base/breakbeat. Great singer. Some lesser songs,"I bought the cd after seeing Breakbeat Era live at a music festival in the Netherlands. The cd itself is very good, with a few great songs, but unfortunately also some lesser songs. I'd say about 90% is good though, so this shouldn't be much of a problem. I guess it's all down to taste on this, but all in all I'd definately recommend it to anyone who likes ""electronic music"". One note, in case you listen to the songs without knowing the band: the drums are real - it's not some drum machine..."
4,It was a good try,"Blending DnB with sultry jazzy female vocals was a good idea, but they didn't quite nail it in the head yet. Maybe on the 2nd album they can get it right. Don't get me wrong many of the tracks excited me at first, but then it got boring. The title track is excellent so is terrible funk. The beats are good, but it just didn't make me want to get up and dance, like other dnb albums do. Overall it was a nice try, but it didn't convince me."
1,"All hype, is my gripe",I saw them promoting this when they played at Coachella- terrible. All the grim parts of jungle plus the drama queen stuff of alterative = lousy-arse result. Very pretentious.
2,Vastly Overrated,"Pretty disappointing, actually- I just don't get all the hype regarding Roni and anything he puts out. Why is this such a big deal? The vocalist is annoying, frankly. The beats are dated, repetitive, and just plain stale, coming from someone who's supposed to be a Heavy in the d n' b arena. Hell, I make better stuff than this at home! Whatever. If you dug it, that's cool, but I'll stick with Photek and Squarepusher for groundbreaking, inspirational sounds, thanks-"
3,Breakbeat Era- This song makes the CD worthy,"Breakbeat Era was one of the first electronically oriented bands I paid attention to in the world of Modern rock. The song, ""Breakbeat Era"" is the most well written song on the CD. This song is very tight and jazzy-sounding. The group could have gone many directions. I believe that this was their first full length CD as a band. Worthy effort and decent spin."
4,Local Impact of Civil War,"A superb blend of contemporary first-person accounts (memoirs, letters, diaries, etc.) that captures the impact of the Civil War on the home front in the Winchester, Virginia, area, as well as life as part of the armed forces of the Confederacy. The principals were present at some of the major events of the Civil War, but the strength of the book is its ability to relate the feel of the times."
4,Good but there is another,"This ballhead is nice and is sturdy. I give 4 stars since it does what it is supposed to do and is sturdy. I received and used but really would have liked a quick release, which I knew this model did not have when purchased. This is a good ballhead but I prefer the Velbon QHD-51Q that also works with the Ultra-MaxiF tripod and has a quick release for a few dollars more. The ballhead screws right onto the tripod with no problem whatsoever."
4,Sherry's Review,"I love these books and author for my daughter. I already had ""The Nineteenth of Maquerk"" in a board book, and I have been looking for others. Great lessons to start teaching young children."
1,Not LOTR book,"Greetings, I have just made a mistake in buying this product thinking I was getting ""The Lord Of The Rings"" book. This is NOT the book but an 8 page review. Don't make the same mistake!!!"
5,"HE WALKS, HE TALKS,.....HE STALKS!!!!!!","Slappy's back. A former ventriloquist foud himin a trash can and then he glued his headtogether. Then his son and daughteraccidentally read an ancient spell that bringsSlappy back to life... again. Uh-oh, bad mistake.Now he's awake again. Can they stop the evildummy from turning them into slave? They betterremember, he may be a dummy, but he's notstupid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,evil dummy,"Slappy the pronounced villian in the goosebumps series[he is my personel favorite in all the goosebumps series]is back and he is even better then the second book [which is my second favorite].Slappy is in a need for a slave so when Mr.Odell brings him home things start to happen.Like Rocky[one of Mr.Odell's dummy's]apears at the table,sitting on top of the door and trying to choke Trina....."
5,Enhancing your life is what it ought to be called,This is a great book that is well written. This is the kind of materials that should have been taught in school. It has real meat and useful tools that make the art of presentation for you and me not just those born with the skills.
1,Good Tips & Ideas but BAD Writing!,"Kahrs' book reflects his experience and subject matter expertise, but this is one of the most poorly written books I have ever come across. Grammatical, punctuation and spelling errors abound and I found it very distracting. The author's style comes across as unprofessional and uneducated and made it very difficult for me to take anything in the book seriously."
1,Unreliable,"When I first got the router, it didn't come on when I first plugged it in. I called tech support, and they told me to leave it plugged in for a few minutes. It finally came on.After that, anytime I had to power cycle the router, or the power blinked, etc, there would be a 10 to 15 minute delay before it came back on. As it liked to lock up frequently, and there was no reset or power switch to be found power cycling by pulling the plug was a frequent activity. I often had to plug directly into my modem while waiting for the router to come up.Finally about 6 months after the initial purchase, it simply didn't come on one day. Completely dead.Not what I'd call quality electronics."
2,Misleading description!,"I was a bit let down after seeing this video. The description is NOT accurate. Henry Morgan is not once even mentioned in the video, and there is no footage of sunken ships at all! Interviewed historians do give some interesting insights, but the reenactments are rather pitiful. Blackbeard looks as though he bought his beard from the cheapest costume shop available. If he looked like that in real life, I doubt anyone would have taken him seriously!"
2,"Should have been called ""Great Pirates of the Golden Age"".","I feel mislead, from the title I was thinking that this was going to be a ""Modern Marvels""-style program about pirate ships. Instead there's maybe 15 minutes about pirate ships, pirate life and how they modified merchant ships into armed vessels. The rest of the 47 minute running time is dedicated to mini-histories of Sir Francis Drake, William ""Captain"" Kidd, Bartholomew Roberts (Black Bart) and Edward Teach (Blackbeard) all told with weak reenactments of ""pirates"" snarling and pulling ropes.Couldn't they have at least found a guy with a real beard to play Blackbeard?! LOL."
3,Hog WIld CD/ Hank Williams Jr.,"I bought two of these CD's. One for myself for a dance routine I was doing, and another for a friend who wanted one for her son who rides a Harley. She told me yesterday that he has had it in his CD player in his truck since he recieved it and plays it all the time. I could not find it anywhere but here. Plus I love Hank!Thanks Linda Benfield"
1,Well i like the song but i didn't like who song it,This song was cool but the singer was not. If you get somebody like nwa to sing it it would sound alot better.
4,Nice Hammock...,"The hammock fit between the posts I had put up, it is a perfect size for me and so far I really enjoy it. So far I have only found one problem and that is I left it out in a light rain and the cotton ropes started to show black mold dots on it, I gentle washed those spots and it came clean. I have only used it a few times and the ropes have stretched some but seem to go back to original shape quickly."
4,"Very Stable, Good Product",I weigh 269lbs. And I needed a hammock that could support my weight and this one does very well. My daughter has a scary habit of pushing me high in it and it holds very well. The only reason I give it a 4 is because the holes in between the netting could be made a little smaller. However for the price it's perfect.
1,Waste of Money,Had the Hammock for two weeks and already broke one of the support strings. Hammock string is very cheap. Don't waste your time or money on this one!
1,You Get What You Pay For Or Don't,"Previously owned Seaview Hammock by same company and since the Padre Island Hammock was rated for my hammock stand and the weight limit was not an issue, I went with the cheaper one. The Padre Island Hammock lasted a grand total of 4 weeks before one of the ropes snapped. It wasn't much of a deal at all."
4,Good value for the price.,"I bought this back in 2007. It just finally just broke after being out in the elements, all year except during winter, rain-or-shine for over 2-years. I'd say it's a good value for the price. In fact I'm going to buy another one right now."
1,This is Junk,This hammock is made very poorly. It became unravelled during the first use and only use. I weigh 155 lbs and the hammock fell apart. DO NOT BUY THIS hammock.
2,Not so great,"One would think that a hammock named Padre Island Hammock would easily fit a Padre Island Hammock Stand. One would be wrong. Keeping it and looking for suitable trees. It would cost more to send it and the hammock stand back.So far, the Padre Island name is not one I'm pleased with."
3,Overall great,Sturdy and comfortable but description said nothing about the wooden separators that were at the head and foot of the hammock.
4,"A ""Must-Have"" for any fan","This album is, in my view, second only to Tales From The Ozone with regard to composition and musicianship. Some of my absolute favorites are on this album. Their version of Lowell George's song, Willin', is the best I've heard (even better than the original by Little Feat). This band was at their peak with this album & Tales From the Ozone (only recently available on CD). This is Commander Cody & His Lost Planet Airmen at their very best."
5,"Been There, Read That","After visiting the Myrtles Plantation in 2008, I picked this novel up at a neighboring plantation. Thank goodness I read it afterward! When we stayed at the Myrtles we kept hearing heavy footsteps outside of our room that sounded like someone walking around in heavy boots. You guessed it, no one was outside our room when we looked. This book was entertaining and fascinating at the same time. I had it completely read before we even got on the plane to leave Louisiana."
1,Badly written fiction,"My husband bought me this book as a gift knowing I love a good, ""true"", ghost story. This book is, as stated on the first page or so, a complete work of fiction. I felt as though I'd gone back in time and was reading a book by Judy Blume...great when you're 15 or so, not so much as an adult. I appreciate a well-written scare as much as the next person, but this is not one of them."
1,Bland and not well written,"A friend recommended this book so I picked it up for what I thought would be a good historical read and I have a fascination with the spirit world. I reads like a bad diary. Bits and pieces of info tossed in with that style of -""oh yes and this, and then this, and oh ya then this happened"". Then it appears an editor went through and tried to give it a bit of sophistication with the over described details of a piece of furniture or architecture. So it feels like you are reading an inexperienced teenagers diary who tries to make it into literature. In addition, you don't really learn any detail or background related to the spirits who inhabit the house."
4,The myrtles,This book was pretty good but not as good as the Amityville horror.this book did not give me the creeps as Amityville did.some things I did have to wonder if they were really true. such as the young girl having sex with a ghost? also the people that had conversations with the ghost? I have seen shows on tv about the myrtles and I do believe it is haunted but some of these stories were out there. but it is a fast fun read for anyone looking for a ghost story.
1,True story? Maybe,"After reading the reviews on this book I ordered it expecting to have an interesting read, but I found it boring and comepletely unbelievable. Why on earth would someone stay in a house that supposeably was haunted and terrified them? Not only that but she chose to sacrifice her marrige for said house even after addmitting her husband was "" possesed "". My advice is to pass this one up, it""s a waste of money and insults your intelligence."
5,Myrtles,"I very much enjoyed the book. However, this author is giving false information. She and her husband DO NOT own the Myrtles. If you go on to www.myrtlesplantation.com it proves the owners are John and Teeta Moss. I very much enjoyed the book, and recommend to all!"
4,very entertaining,"While I found this book to be extremely entertaining, I do have have one question. It is about the character of Hamp that Frances had such a connection with at their first meeting. According to the book, she first met Hamp while staying with John L. just prior to taking ownership of the plantation. She describes him as a ""giant figure"" and a man with a very deep, hypnotic voice. Later in the book a picture is taken in the house showing white swirls above Hamp's head clearly forming the year 1967. When asked what this meant, Hamp confirms that 1967 is the year that he was born. Now I may not be the sharpest tack in the box, but by my calculations that would mean Hamp was only 13 years old when Frances purchased the Myrtles in 1980. Can anyone explain this to me? Ironically, Hamp is introduced in chapter 13."
4,Love the Myrtles,"I ordered this book because when I was a child I visited the Myrtles for a tour. I thought the tour was great and the place was beautiful. As I got older, I heard more and more about the haunting that happened there and who the ghost were. I kept hearing different stories so I decided to buy this book to hear it from someone who owned the Myrtles. I love the book but it is not what I expected. I expected it to be all about the history and the stories of how the ghost that haunt there die. Instead, it is her journey of how she found it and what personal experiences she has. I love hearing what happened to her and this is a book I can't put down, just wish it had more history."
2,Don't bother,I was very dissapointed with this book. It isn't even well written. I was expecting a solid history of the Myrtles and I got a history of the author. There is sexual content that adds absolutely nothing to the story. I wasn't at all interested in a description of her husbands backside as he made love to her friend. That tells the story of the Myrtles----how? The book isn't at all scary or creepy. The people who found it so must scare easily.It is mostly laughable.Keep your money in your pocket and pass this one by.
2,I have to say it~,"I was so annoyed with this author, I wanted to shake her. I do not suffer fools gladly. She went and bought a house that she knew was haunted, she experienced things there herself before the final purchase. She still wanted it. Fine, I would too. But then to run around and act silly and fearful each time something occurred, well that is just annoying. I seriously disliked her. Lillie Mae Scott, the housekeeper, I loved~ but Frances annoyed the bejeebers out of me.Typical haunted house stuff. Nothing stood out much to me. Of course having lived with a "" ghost"" or a few in the past may have tainted my view a bit. I enjoy the company myself.."
2,Not worth reading,"What's bad about this book is that you can tell the author who lived in this mansion exaggerated a lot. It ranges from the house physically changing from the outside to a ghost trying to have sex with women. I thought this was based on a true story, not a fictional movie created to try to scare people."
5,Michael's Healing,"Album was excellent. Amazing that in spite of what was going on in his life personally, he stll managed to put out a collection of work praising God."
5,Excellent choice!,"I recently purchased this Microwave from a dept. store in CT. I got it on sale for 89.99, which I was rather leary about in the beginning.I brought the microwave home, and took it out of the box. It fit perfectly on the corner of my counter where I had originally planned to place it. It was a rather pain removing the plastic, protective covering ...but from there it was smooth sailing.It is rather quiet microwaving, which is a definate plus, and it heats things up rather quickly. I popped a bag of popcorn the other night, and only had 4 actual popcorn kernels in the bag.I'd recommend this microwave for anyone ....!"
2,Just barely outlasted the warranty...,"We received this microwave as a wedding gift just over one year ago. We LOVE how clean and sleek it looks, and the smart defrost features are really cool. BUT...it comes with a one-year warranty, and about two weeks after that was expired, the microwave went nuts-- it starts going on its own as soon as we shut the door, and does not respond to the stop button being pressed. We've troubleshot enough to realize we are going to have to take it to a repair shop (the nearest authorized dealer is 10 miles away), and since the warranty expired just a few weeks ago, we'd have to pay so much for parts and labor that we might as well just get a new one. I'm sorry to say that we will not be purchasing a Sharp microwave again-- we like the looks and the performance when it actually worked, but we can't afford to buy a new microwave every year. :("
5,beautiful,I saw this item at Target but when my other microwave broke Target had stopped carrying it. So I tried to order it from 2 other online stores that claimed they had it in stock but they didn't so I finally found it on Amazon. It was shipped the next day and I rec'd it in about 3 days. No problem! It looks great and I love how the buttons are hidden and I also love the 1 minute button on the front. I recommend this microwave to anyone as long as you can find it.
3,Consider another product if...,you are concerned about cosmetic issues. The sticker on the front of this oven simply would not come off for me. I wish I had paid more for a sticker-free oven.
2,Misleading at best,"After buying this book, you then discover that there is a WHOLE other series of books they want you to buy afterwards. This book barely covers the areas I thought it would. Almost the entire book preaches on where to learn, and where to buy, and board a horse. But doesnt barely, or not even, covers the step by step essentials of how to groom, apply tack, or even how to ride a horse. They want you to buy the other books to learn that information. Save your money."
5,Riding as an adult,As a late bloomer to the joys of horseback riding this book was extremely helpful. I would suggest this to anyone like me getting a late start at having fun
4,I wish I spoke Swedish!,"I watched this complete movie on You Tube; and even though I didn't know what they were saying, it was still really good! I love Michael. He has the most beautiful eyes."
4,Working properly,It is working properly. Good design and easy of use. The only con is the price. For me is too high.
3,I am a 4-5 Year user,"I have had the base station and the Handset for over 5 years now. The base station has its unique issues, where if there is no Ink Roller in the fax machine, most memory functions do not work. A simple Cello-Tape fixed this problem, I tied down the lever for the Ink roller and things worked great after that. Never used the unit to receive faxes, though I can send them if I need to.I have gone through over a $150 worth of batteries in the past 5 years with the hand sets (and I have 4 of them around the house). Though the handsets worked well initially, they have thier issues with a G Router. The batteries are expensive to buy. I have solved this now by using 3 Energizer AAA rechargeable 2500 mAh batteries and soldering the Anodes / Cathodes of 3 batteries in series ... together and then cover them with electrical tape, to create a pseudo battery pack @ 3.6 volts.If you have some time and innovation at your disposal, do go for these if you find them for cheap."
1,Sharp UX-K01 2.4 GHz Cordless Handset for UX-CC500 Fax,"I wish I could rate this phone in minus stars. I bought a refurbished fax/copier/answering machine and from day one the handset did not work. Since purchasing the unit (the base works fine), I have gone through 2 replacement handsets that didn't work either. I even purchased a new handset from another vendor and had to return it because it couldn't be programmed (which was one step ahead of the other 3 that couldn't be charged to get to the programming step.) I am still waiting for a working replacement from Sharp 3 months after buying the initial unit. A Sharp representative claims there isn't a global problem with this phone, but that the universe has obviously conspired against me to prevent me obtaining a working handset. Stay far away from this phone if possible."
5,The Best Reference for Surgical Researchers,"This book is the best reference of surgical research for both beginer and rofessional. It covers from the setup of lab, designing the experiments in different common surgical models, data analysis, to the preparation for publication and meetings. Each chapter gives the foundamental to detail information which would be necessary in your study, as well as the clear fidures. Other than Molecular cloning, Current protocol series, this book is definitely another essential reference in the lab. Even as a physician I learn much from it."
4,It'll draw you in and make you wonder,"This is the type of book which you have to become a part of. You can't hope to read it and understand it. In some cases, I had to stop and reread passages one, two, even three times a piece. But once I dove into the meat of the book, needless to say I was entranced. I could easily see this book embodying the future (or is it vice versa?). I was not turned off by ridiculous technologies or superhuman beings. Instead, this book chooses to reflect upon basic human values, virtues, modes of thought and reason, and instrinsic drives and how they could easily push apart our race and fill us with ambition. The Shapes and the Mechs are beautfully crafted factions, each with real potential and dissidents. If you're looking for a book that will push you, that will make you think, that will drive you to wonder at the possibilities the future holds, I suggest clicking the add to cart button above right now."
5,I loved it,"This book is very very good. I understand now why Bruce Sterling is considered to be a co-founder of the Cyberpunk movement. This book reminded me of Alfred Bester's ""Tiger! Tiger!"". Abelard Lindsay is the most exciting figure I have encountered since Gulliver Foyle. The book develops the schism between the humanities and the mechanics, both of them are leaving mankind behind. I wonder if C. P Snow thought of this when he wrote Two Cultures. Abundance of ideas presented in short, hard efficient prose."
3,Eh.,"Main story was too convoluted for it to be really interesting. Minimal development, minimal detail... much waxing poetic.The short stories that followed were, much, much better. Not quite sure if they make up for slogging one's way through the story proper, but I enjoyed them. The rating should be taken as applying to the short stories, not to the main story (which would get a 1.5)"
5,A major leap forward for SF,"I read a lot of science fiction, both the classics and newer ones. I am happy to say the this book has really got me back into Science Fiction when I was starting to think that I hadn't read anything truly groundbreaking since Arthur C. Clark'es ""The Light of Other Days.""Schimatrix Plus, despite its complexity (it can easily be labeled ""hard"" science fiction) details the life of our main character, whose age spans hundreds of years. It probably won't move you to cry, but it will give you plenty to think about."
5,Simply one of the best,"This has to be one of the finest Handel operas on DVD, not only for the singing but for the production: the sets are great and there is always action on stage that goes well with the music--even when Handel is being intentionally silly!Highly recommended!"
2,Not Impressed !,"Julius Caesar; (July 12 or July 13, 100 BC - March 15, 44 BC ) dresses in 19th century English colonial army uniform? Try to make Handel's opera a Broadway show? Not impressed!"
5,Simply Terrific,"Having been to the production at Glyndebourne in 2005, and the revival this year I am pleased to say this is a terrific and true reproduction. Sound is wonderful in both stereo and DTS, with very effective sound staging and balance between singers and orchestra. Visually it's wonderful too, though some of the closer shots are a bit shocking if you are used to viewing from afar; it would be good if OPUS could use the DVD features that enable the viewer to choose their own preferred camera angle. As for the Opera production and cast, then as near to perfect as I've ever experienced anywhere (including the Met, Covent Garden, Glyndebourne or Sydney) of Handel or indeed anything sub-Wagnerian. The Age of Enlightenment create a beautiful complement to first rate singing (none were bettered by this years cast - Daniels included) and the McVicar production a brilliant bridge of entertainment and emotion. Laughed and cried at almost every scene."
2,Disappointed,"So I get this book thinking I would recieve a new book because I clicked ""buy New"". Well, not only is it not new, but it has an altogether different front cover than the one pictured, it has a scratch on the front cover and a bend and puncture hole in the back. It smells like an old library book too and is a bit yellowed. I spent 15.64 including S/H and don't think it's worth even half that price. Very disgusted. I contacted the seller and they replied ""simply return it and we will give a full refund"". Well, I SIMPLY don't feel like wasting more money mailing it back to them and taking the chance of the book getting ""lost in the mail"" and not recieving squat back. Will not do business with this vendor again."
4,Conducive to relaxation,"This particular album, created specifically for Reiki, is conducive to a very relaxing environment which is essential to an effective Reiki treatment session. The nature sounds coupled with the musical instrumental make for a great addition to a Reiki CD library."
4,"Great for tots who love Thomas, trains in general, or lifting flaps","A fun and simple Thomas book. My twins love to lift all the flaps - and each page has a ton of flaps. ABC's, colors, shapes. A nice book to add to your library."
3,Not Enough Thomas!,"This is a very nice book, and my son absolutely loves the first page which shows the roundhouse and each character engine behind a flap. However, we have one complaint: there isn't enough Thomas! Some of the pages seem very disconnected from the Thomas theme. For example: the page showing the inside of Sir Topham Hat's house. I think we own just about every Thomas video on the market and I cannot recall ever seeing Sir Hat's house. My son does not make the connection, and tends to lose interest in the book about halfway through. However, he can spend 1/2 hour on the first page alone, so I guess that makes up for it."
4,My son loves this!,"When this book arrived, I was happy to discover it was a larger board book. It has tons of lift flaps that keeps Dawson interested. We enjoy looking at this book every night before bed. It was worth the price!!"
4,Fun and educational,My 3 year old loved this when he got it last year however he ripped off the flaps so luckily when a friend got him another one he knew enough not to rip it. It encourages parent/child interaction which every child needs for development. The flaps are somewhat difficult to open initially so adult helpful supervision is recommended.
3,Good for 2 year olds,"We've gotten a good 4 months use out of this book, with several fringe benefits to lifting up the tabs and looking. We can practice recognition of the trains' (where is Percy, Thomas, etc.), look for colors, make sounds (the cuckoo clock, dog barking, trains of course). The numbered flaps are a little hard to see, but still fun to look. When I was able to keep them from tearing the flaps off entirely, we enjoyed the anticipation of looking underneath them. Worth the price because it's interactive and parents can make more of the pictures than just the flaps if so inclined."
5,The Original Rulebook!! An Outstanding Work!,"I came across a copy of this book back in 1983, and consider it the basis from which all other Star Trek movies and series should be based. The illustrations are great and the fictional news stories make it read like a history text. I highly recommend it."
1,Neve sent book,"I ordered this book and never recieved it. I waited the alloted time before contacting the seller, thinking that maybe the mail was just slow. I emailed the seller many times with no response. I had to involove Amazon to help in the situtation. After that everything was fine and I recieved my money back..no book, but I got my money. Wouldn't buy from them again."
4,overall good.,i thought going by the size i normal wear this would be good a little sung but that could be because i got a bit chubbier.. over all a good pair of overalls for the money..
4,Representing E.S. Lubbock Tx,"The album is tight, ghetto g be going off. Many other songs are crump from Coop as well. He came threw representinWest Texas."
3,"slanted, yet fascinating",Simon has managed to construct a book with a heavy liberal tilt that is both fascinating (insofar as it reveals the Court's recent inner-workings) and well written.
2,Utterly mediocre,"Interesting idea, but not very well written. Lizzie's reluctance to use curtains encourages a man's obsession, and when she spends the night with a new boyfriend, his ire. In the hands of a better writer, this could have been a thrilling tale, but as it is, kind of pedestrian and lacking any insight. The idea that anyone would seriously consider a poltergeist, rather than a human agent, in an urban setting in this day and age, really strains credulity."
1,Awful!,"After reading ""In the Company of the Courtesan"", I picked up ""Transgressions"". This book is about as much ""literature"" as is a Harlequin Romance novel. Not only were the characters cliched and utterly rediculous but, the author seemed to be having some sort of contest to see how many times she could use the words ""f%$*"" and ""nipple"" in one book. When the detective delivered the line, ""Welcome to law enforcement baby"", I quit reading. What 1970's TV cop did she base THAT character on? Unimaginative stupidity is how I'd describe it. All it needs is Fabio on the cover."
3,a medium work,"After The Birth of Venus and Mapping the Edge, this one is a little disappointing. The psychology of the characters and the prose are powerful, but the plot is weaker, the imagination more mediocre, and the details not as convincing. But I still strongly recommend Dunant. She is enjoyable and gives things to think over. I'd just say, if anyone is still deciding between Mapping the Edge and this one, ""Go for Mapping""."
5,SARAH DUNANT IS THE BEST WRITER I'VE EVER READ!!!,"Since I started reading Sarah Dunant some months ago with BIRTH MARKS, I did not know that since then I was missing an important part of my literary life. Sarah is the better crime fiction writer I've ever read. She make us wants to go under the bed and laugh out loud at the same time. I just wonder why she has written so little quatity of books. She's the kind of writer we could keep reading forever. And TRANSGRESSIONS is the kind of book you just can't put down. Excelent plot, excelent characters and everything a reader wants: action, suspense and sense of humor. BUY THIS BOOK!!! You'll never want to stop reading Sarah Dunant.Also recommended: BIRTH MARKS & UNDER MY SKIN"
3,"Good robe, but wish they had a longer size","I wanted a pool robe for a long time. By pool robe, I mean one that is towel-like in material, not the comfy lounging robes in the pajama section of the department store. I was baffled why such an item is not all that easy to find in abundance, especially for men. This on the surface is precisely the kind of robe I was looking for especially with the hood. Unfortunately, this item is sized more for women and so my petite wife uses it mostly as it fits her perfectly. I wish they had a longer version; I'm not tall but the belt sits well above my waist"
3,Interesting ideas presented poorly,"Arnett raises some intriguing points regarding the intersection of postmodern theory and the work of Bonhoeffer. Unfortunately, the text suffers from poor editing. The phrase ""world come of age"" is repeated endlessly, spelling mistakes are frequent, and Arnett mentions key concepts, only to fully introduce and explain where they come from pages later. All of this makes the reading somewhat confusing and distracts from getting the most from the book, but if you can get past these flaws Arnett's work should give you a better understanding of Bonhoeffer's writing."
3,Outside ONLY,I bought this for use inside the beta 87 microphone. It is intended only for the outside and did not provide any details in the listing. I managed to make it fit and it works great inside.
4,Good at first but flakes off after just a day of smacking balls.,"I really liked this stencil ink since it looked good with my strings and Pure Storm GT. However, I dislike how it stains anything it comes into contact with and that it doesn't last too long on the racquet. Otherwise, it's a good product. Keep in mind that they won't send you Gamma stencil ink. They actually send you Tourna stencil ink!"
1,Turned off by the review.,"I was interested in researching this book as I believe that Egypt had an esoteric school at the time of Jesus because it was there that He was nurtured as a child. But the review claims: ""Although it is commonly believed that Jesus lived during the first century A.D., there is no concrete evidence to support this fact from the Roman and Jewish historians who would have been his contemporaries."" I suggest that the author study the book: ""Joshephus The Complete Works"" where he will find mention of Jesus by a contemporary Jewish historian.Given that this research was overlooked by the author, I decided not to purchase the book on the grounds that his research is selective and incomplete."
1,WORST PHONE EVER,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FROM THE LOCAL ELECTRONIC STORE, IT LOOKED GOOD IN THE STORE BUT THATS ABOUT IT. IT SUCKS!RECEPTION IS HORRIBLE,TONS OF STATIC. THE BATTERY TAKES FOREVER TO CHARGE AND DONT LAST LONG.SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME, MONEY AND FRUSTRATION AND AVOID THIS PHONE, ITS NOT WORTH ONE DOLLAR."
1,the BAD phonemate phone is very bad and no good at all.,"i got the phone, i put it all together, and charged it for 25 hours, and it never worked. i called their 1-800 number, which didn't work, and went to the website, where they had absolutely nothing to do with phones. this phone was bad news."
1,More of a Train Conductor's Hat,I purchased this hat for my husband. Was quite disappointed w/quality and height of the hat which was way way too tall (inches). My husband looked like a train conductor not a captain. It was even worse when we had to pay to ship it back to Amazon as they wouldn't reimburse us as 'nothing was wrong w/it'. Get another hat elsewhere.
3,wrinkled,The hat was nice but when I received it it was very wrinkled. It was a gift I sure hope they knew how to take the wrinkles out!
2,High expectations,"Very disappointed with this purchase. Not the quality I was expecting for the price. Ordered as a gift for my fathers birthday and was alittle embarassed by the condition. White crown terribly wrinkled, brim appears to be unevenly sewn to crown. Looks like a ""joke"" hat.Would not recommend as a serious hat. Delivered within days of ordering."
4,SOMETHING HAPPENED HERE,"This is a good sample of the music from the famous documentary.However,be warned,many tracks are not listed under their real titles.If you've never heard the score before for instance,you won't notice that GUADALCANAL MARCH and BENEATH THE SOUTHERN CROSS are actually THEME OF THE FAST CARRIERS and FIRE ON THE WATERS.Is it HISTORY CHANNEL or Q RECORDS who are responsable of those mistakes?Apart from that,you can still buy that cd and enjoy that best of of VICTORY AT SEA."
2,disappointment,"After reading the reviews and discovering that the CD is not the same as the original records that I still own, I do not plan on purchasing the CD until RCA releases what was/is a magnificent piece of work. Perhaps it is political corectness that is keeping them from releasing the ""original"" work ""uncensored"". Until such time as they give the present generation a look into one of the greatest recordings made, I will stay with my 33 1/3 rpm recordings, and transfer them to my computer myself..."
2,This cd iz aiight,THis cd aint that bad i only bought it cuzz im a crip too and i wanted to hear what they were all about cuzz my boyz kept talkin bout them but i dont think you would want to waste your money on this cd if you really want it download it from some site cuzz there iz only like 3 good songs and all the other ones aint really all that great but i hope i helped yall foolz...this DoPeY reppin IMC stay tru..peaceOh yea...the second cd is even worse than the first one so i dont think you should buy that either cuzz thatz another waste of money!
1,wow how can i even put it,see this is the defintion of ignorant black poeple thinkin they can rap because their skin is black an they shoot people ppshhh! lol serious though an ima huge westcoast rap fan but theese people aint rappers. this is trash for your garbage bag!....1
2,ok,This cd is okay; its not great. This cd is not as good as some of the crip stuff on the bagin on wax cd. Save your money and don't buy this. I only listened to this cd because back in the day I used to kick it with crips.
2,"Quack,Quack!","""The Hospital"" as well-crafted as it is is a wholly unpleasant viewing experience. It is not so much a dark comedy but a mean-spirited one. I was a fan of Paddy Chayefsky's ""Network"" and at least that film had a little bit of light to compensate for the darkness. I'm led to believe that Chayefsky must have had a bad experience with the medical profession and this resulted in him skewering it as a whole. If George C.Scott's character is supposed to be the voice of reason why is it that when he's not brooding, drinking, or contemplating suicide he's off on some rant? Diana Rigg is completely wasted in this film. Her whole purpose here seems to be to sport a short mini-skirt and be ravaged by Scott's character. The film is also not helped by the lead-footed direction of Arthur Hiller. The medical profession can be lampooned but don't look for it in this uneven tirade of a film."
1,unrealistic,"The main draw of this movie is the rare appearance of Dianna Rigg outside Shakespearian theatre after her Avengers run. She is much more sexual in appearance and speech than her role in The Avengers including a low cut outfit and what seems a heavily padded bra.For the plot to work the hospital is organized in a totally different, suboptimal, way than real hospitals. For instance, in real emergency rooms people are treated first and then at checkout asked for their insurance.Also for the plot to work totally illogical things have to happen. Not to spoil the movie for you I cannot tell details, but ask yourself on the second viewing how a certain person could gain the knowledge that motivated his conduct."
4,The Hospital,"I purchased the DVD (The Hospital) with George C. Scott because I enjoyed that film, years ago. It reminded me of the city hospital I attended nursing school in and worked in the 50s & 60s. The disk was absolutly blank and an utter disappointment, call it the blank hospital. I feel cheated. I rate the film itself 4 star, The script about this hospital was almost unbelievable but from my prospective it was so true. I thought perhaps someone that worked with me wrote it. Enjoy it if you get a working DVD."
4,One of George C. Scott's Best,Excellent movie for a home collection. I watch it 2-3 times a year. It gives an excellent snapshot of the struggle of the establishment and anti-establishment in the late '60s.
4,PalmBeach Jewelry 14k Gold-Plated Antiqued Filigree Jade Ring,The ring was sized correctly and wears well. The jade stones are smooth and the filigree is very nice looking. I have enjoyed wearing it.
4,JAde,"Jade looks like plastic bobbles, but the color of metal is cool and I really like design. I normally wear silver, so this is a nice change."
5,Very Pretty,Very pretty ring. Very classic looking. Gold is a bit to yellow for me thus looking a bit fake but it is so can't really complain to much. The stones are beautiful and looks great on.
3,Ok ring,"This ring only gets three stars due to the coloring of the band. The band is not as it looks in the picture, it is much more ""gold"" looking,making the ring look cheap, and not antique, as shown in the picture.It's an ok ring, I just wish it looked like the picture. I kept the ring, but don't wear it as much as I would if it had looked like the photo."
3,"""Self-Made Mess"" is hardly a mess!","Awesome CD! The lyrics are not stellar, and sometimes Josh (the lead singer) has a hard-to-understand voice, but putting all that aside, this Boston-based band is going to make it big!"
1,Big Let Down,"I love Mariah Carey she is one of my favorite singers, but in this movie I was expecting them to give her a much uplifting part, instead it was kind of sad that she was in a bad relationship and helping some brothers get from one place to the next with confusion as to what was wrong with one of the sick brothers and her husband which is a cop is now looking for her. It was a boring and sad movie. they did not really showcase Mariah singing ability which I was expecting, this should have been just a cable movie, PERIOD."
3,Good For Mariah Fans,This Movie is a very slow and quiet movie and even though i am a mariah carey fan the movie only got intresting when she apperared but all in all it was an ok movie not bad but the story was moving extremly slow and so can get boring
4,I was pleasantly surprised,Good movie. The story engaged me and the acting was well done. Mariah Carey was very good in the film.
4,If the movie a chance,"i put off seeing this movie for a long time, i just didn't think it was going to be good. Also because i am cheap when it comes to buying movies. Lucky for me my mom has netflix. i saw it on there and the movie turned out to be really good. I was crying at the end. People dying always gets to be, then add on that the brothers backstory and it gets to you. To be honest the movie is slow getting started, and i would agree with another people who stated that the story picks up when Mariah enters the story. I would have given the movie 5 stars but i fell asleep in the beginning. I don't know if it was really boring or i could've been just plain tired. The second time though i watched it the whole way through and liked it. i wished they could've done some backstories on the dying brother (i forgot his name). i wanted to know see his past, besides his brother."
2,"Interesting, but not Convincing","This seems to be a typical old-fashioned herbal, only with emphasis on essential oils and aromatics rather than simply herbs. In other words, lots of untested claims. I assume they're untested, as the author provides little evidence for his assertions, save a very few anecdotal stories. I have no problem with anecdotal evidence, but I'd like rather more of it if I'm to be reassured a treatment is worth trying.I think I myself could write a book like this--I have a good imagination, and it looks as though that may be all that's required. I gave it two stars because I found it mildly entertaining."
5,"""Yeah! Blame it on the little guy...!""","Mike is the cutest PIXAR character since the Toy Story Alien. Mike is soft and cuddly and looks great sitting on the edge of a shelf or desk. Move his arm to rotate his eye and hear him say 8 different amusing phrases like ""What are you lookin' at two eyes???"" and ""Eye, eye captain!"".A cool toy for any bedroom or office, suitable for kids, teens.... AND adults!Just looking at him makes you smile."
4,"fun, but sounds tinny","I think this is a fun toy, but he doesn't have too many phrases. Just ""what's that over there"" said twice and ""atta monster"", in addition to the other sayings previously listed. He is cute though. Especially for such a [inexpensive] price. I will say that the Sully Room Guard is a blast and the Babblin' Boo is great. Mike is nice and squishy except for his battery pack of course and his eye moves when you move his arm. Kinda cheezy looking eye and his voice is pretty ""tinny"" sounding and kind of hard to hear at times. That's why he didn't get 5 stars."
4,I LIKE MIKE!!!,This was a very cute toy.My 2 year old loves the movie and really enjoy the toy.Great size sounds great also.
4,Nifty idea,"My 2 young daughters really like it and request it often, I hope to see another book in the series soon."
4,Relevant,"I wanted something relevant that students could work on while I was working with small groups - without having to spend a lot of time on my part organizing. This works well. It was time consuming at first to set up the folders (I laminated), but now that it is done there is very little time on my part required. I teach 4th grade and plan on getting the centers for 4th - 5th next year and starting students on 3-4 at the beginning of the year and switching to 4-5 during the 2nd semester. Now I want to try the one for science and the one for geography."
4,Enjoyable and Informative,"I found this book to be easy to read, well organized and very informative for the beginner. It covers safety issues and guidelines, as well as offers suggestions for play. Im glad I purchased this book!"
1,Warning,"I thought this might be interesting, but was I wrong. I read the first few pages, then skimmed the rest, then tossed it in the trash. I really did."
4,Good starter information,"For those that are new to the Jesus Only issue this book offers a well written and concise over view of the beliefs of the largest ""Oneness"" group, the United Pentecostal Church (UPCI). This work is not meant to be an exhaustive rebuttal against every doctrine in the movement. While not agreeing with everything the author writes, there is enough information here to inform the average reader about this movement. It appears that many of the negative reviews are from those in the movement that are responding emotionally to some one who opposes their doctrine.For a more in-depth treatment of the topic please see Oneness Pentecostals and the Trinity by Gregory A. Boyd or A Definitive Look at Oneness Theology: Defending the Tri-Unity of God by Edward L. Dalcour. Dalcour's book is the best I have read on the subject.Read church history, read theology, pray and seek God and the error of Oneness becomes plain.Inconsistency is the symptom of a larger disease... heresy.Grace,John"
1,The author should have not have shown so much bias.,"If one wants to know what another believes he should read the info put out by the people who believe it , not by hostile witness's. This book is exactly that a hostile witness against another's faith. Wait for it to be discounted, both in price and by the people Mr. Beisner writes against."
1,I agree with R. J. Caplinger,"I too saw the presentation that Mr. Beisner gave on the Ankerberg show. He was very rude and interuptive through the whole debate. Take a look at the response that was given by him in this review. He can't even accept constructive critism.However,I did find his book to be very educational. There were a lot of scriptures that he tried to use to prove trinitarianism that I had never seen used before. I can honestly say that I can use this book to witness to trinitarians about the true Oneness belief. There are so many rediculous points that he tries to make with the Bible that when are read have absolutely nothing to do with the point he was trying to make in the first place."
4,from a masterful writer,"The late Berton Rouche, along with St. Clair McKelway, wrote regular columns for the New Yorker magazine on medical and social issues (McKelway wrote ""True Tales from the Annals of Crime and Rascality."" Both had a genious for lucid non-fiction that seemed stranger than fiction. Highly recommended if a bit (!) dated."
4,Does What It Needs to Do,I bought this band to use withEA Sports Active 2. It is heavier than the band that comes with the game: exactly what I needed. The only reason I rated this band 4 rather ta 5 stars is that the first one I got broke after having it for about 6 months (maybe just a bit longer). I ended up buying the same band because the price was just right for what I got.
1,poor theraband product,Theraband tore in half when I merely pulled on it after removing it from shipping package.
5,thera band's are good for rehabbing your ankle,"i like the black thera band because it actually provides resistance. i used to use the other colors, but i never felt like my ankle was improving with them. with the black one i can feel my ankle working."
5,RV Escapades,"What a fun book of short stories about the adventures of traveling the country in a motor home! A great book to give as a gift, or just to read for pure entertainment. You'll laugh out loud!"
3,Useful yet,The book touches on a wide list of e-mail and Internet tools and facilities. No doubt it upgrades the reader'sknowledge about details that normally we tend to overlook or forget. Yet the element of e-mail business startegy is not as stressed as the book title implies .
1,E-mail Business Strategies,"1. it contains very elementary contents] 2. it didn't organized very well,so i got a headache! 3. it doesn't match with the title of this book very well 4. this book published like a grey note not bookIf I could see this book at bookstore, i wouldn't purchase that."
1,"3/8"" High and a Page Deep","The book has a smatter of information on a lot of topics, but treats each topic so superficially that it is altogether unimformative. The front cover says, ""Written for those with limited or more Internet experience,"" which includes about everybody. But it is a very long way from being all things to all people. The back cover says that ""..after reading this book, we're confident that you will be an intermediate level Internet user."" No way."
2,missing tracks?????,"i've been waiting for this fantastic album to be available on CD for ever. so reading the track listing i see there are some SONGS MISSING?? ""I Just Wanna Live It My Way"", which is beautiful blues ballad isn't listed. is it on the actual CD? make sure you get the 2 Radio Active songs on the Anthology CD's. those don't sound like ""vinyl transfers"". this CD needs a proper and complete re-release. one of my favorite albums of all time!!!! missing track!!!!! WTF!!!"
3,A creative departure for Pat Travers,"I think Pat Travers was experimenting with another type of sound on this one, but he may have left many of his fans feeling a bit perplexed. It has kind of a reggae feel, but reggae doesn't really combine very well with heavy metal. Many of the guitar solos sound muffled in the audio effects he was playing with extensively on this record, and some songs come off as half completed concepts. It grows on you if you let it, but it isn't one of his best efforts. Definitely lacks the bouncy rock feel of his signature song ""Boom Boom Out Go The Lights."" It is like he was listening to old Hendrix albums and tried to create a Hendrix like feel across the record, but only partly succeeded due to a fairly high level of sonic obscurity generated by the effects pedals he used all through the record. I have seen Pat Travers CD's selling for 30 bucks plus each in many record stores recently, which I think is kind of weird."
3,Next to the last.....,"This disk is worth the price for the,""New age music"" track. The rest is mediocre at best. The first song alone is worth 3.5 stars."
3,"Nice shirt, weak head dress","My six year old son like to pretend he is a native American, and Davy Crockett. This costume can work for both. He was thrilled when he received it, and has already been in our lake with it on. Yes, it survived. The head dress isn't as nice as the one pictured, the feathers are much smaller."
2,Headdress was VERY disappointing!,Bought this for my 9 year old son. The 8-10 size fit him perfectly (he is on the thin side). I was VERY disappointed with the Headdress! It is completely different than the picture on the cover. The feathers were small and skimpy looking. There were about 5. I wish I would have bought a different costume. The top was good. My son enjoyed the costume anyway.
2,For new groups,"This book - despite what it claims - is geared towards people who have extremely little or no knowledge on running a show - let alone a theatre company. In that respect, yes, it walks you easily through the whole process and will be very helpful.If you already know ANYTHING about theatre...or have run a show yourself - look for a different book, this one will not be of assistance."
1,Not As Advertised,"This oven is advertised as a Double Wall Gas Oven. It does have two cavities, BUT it is NOT a DOUBLE OVEN. The Upper cavity is a true oven, but the Lower cavity is just a broiler. The controls do not allow you to use both cavities at the same time, i.e. Bake and Broil in the separate cavities.The upper cavity (oven) vents blow right on to the contol panel. Once the oven has been on for a while you will need an oven mitt to touch the control panel to adjust any settings. Very poor design.The only nice thing about this unit are the electronic controls with the Start Timer, Temperature Control, Operations Timer, and Pre-Heat. Its too bad that you have to be careful not to burn yourself when using these controls once the oven is on."
2,Misleading DVD -- very little NSX content,"Be forewarned that this video contains very little NSX content. The first 38 minutes are about this history of the Honda Motor Company -- interesting, but no NSXen are seen. Then, from 38:00 to 44:00 (six minutes), the video talks about the NSX, but even this is very sparse. From 44:00 to the end it's more Accords and Civics.As an NSX enthusiast, I was very disappointed."
1,Misleading,"When I bought the dvd, I assumed it was entirely about the NSX. Unfortunately, only the last 6 minutes of the dvd were devoted to the car that is on the cover and title."
2,Poor Read,"""Lacking where it counts"" is the best review I can provide. The writing itself is respectable, though nothing remarkable. Where the book fails to captivate is in its vague, mystic story. Though its only possible audience is that of computer savvy individuals, Chapman moves quickly to alienate them in an unrealistic future world of computing, where everything takes place in virtual reality. If you have nothing better to do, then read it on-line where it is publicly available, but don't waste your money on this one."
2,Great when space is limited,We purchased this bassinet because of its thin size. We live in a one bedroom apartment while we are building our house and this was for our second child. It fit really nice between our bed and the wall. And with it there it doesn't rock at all. The only thing I do not like is the fact that you need to take it apart to wash it. And with an infant that is fairly often. Our limited space also makes that a little more difficult to acomplish.
2,Poor design for newborns,"This is a beautiful bassinet but is lacking realistic features for a newborn. Bassinet reviews were all terrible, but I chose this one because I thought this had the least negatives. Here are the issues I found: 1. You cannot remove the cloth cover (which comes in direct contact with the baby) without disassembling the entire bassinet. There should be velcro or something so as not to require a screwdriver to do the laundry. 2. If the baby moves in the bassinet, it rocks on its own, often startling them. 3. The ""mattress"" is thin and too large for bassinet sheets, so you either buy a new mattress or have only 1 set of sheets, again making laundry difficult. On the pro side, it is easy to move, attractive, and relatively easy to put together. I would not buy this again. I would get a pack and play with a bassinet instead."
4,Doesn't rock by itself,"When we bought this, we thought it rocked on its own like a mechanical cradle/swing, but it does not. All in all, the construction and style are very good."
5,Learn how to do it right.,Excelent book on how to work assmbler langue to do what you want and need it to do. A Must have for anyone writing device drivers. Perfect for the beginer to advanced programer. He covers every topic clearly and in a way for everyone to understand.
2,Not so much about linux assembly,"It is a book which should focus on linux assembly. However, I didn't see much of what I want to find about AT&T format. Maybe if you want to write some codes about linux device driver, it is a reference book. But if you try to find some information about AT&T format, try other way."
1,Have to agree with other reviewers...,"This book is disappointing to say the least.... No reference on AT&T syntax etc. The information presented is rather disparate & lacks coherency, very confusing & difficult to excogitate. As a neophyte, I would like to be able to access all references in a central location, where I can check the assembly command; see it's syntax; look up the CPU instruction; check it's syntax & see how it relates to the register in question, whilst at the same time I want a brief description of the register; what it's name means & what it does; have a list of system call numbers; their descriptions & functions etc. Kernel internals were briefly discussed but left much wanting. Free documentation served me much better. If you know what you want it's all availible online."
2,Skip it,"I didn't really find this book useful at all. I mean for one, it's titled as a Linux ASM book, but an entire chapter is focused on DOS assembly.It's a very disorganized book and I wasn't able to write a single working assembly program using this book. I picked up the following book to get a grasp of assembly:Assembly Language for Intel-Based ComputersNot Linux specific; examples might not even work in Linux but the book is awesome at explaining the ops, registers and give short examples.Also jump on comp.lang.asm.x86... very helpful people."
4,An Old Favorite in a new container,"These are some of the RCA Red Seal Classic recordings from theirLiving Stereo series remastered for SACD. The Saint-Saensrecording comes from a recently discovered Three Channel mastertape, so on the SACD Surround portion of the disc you hear Left,Center, and Right channels only. Not 5.1 or 4.0. What you do hearare Three of Charles Munch's finer recordings with the BostonSymphony Orchestra. The recordings made in 1956 and 1959, manageto stand the test of time, and are welcome additions to the SACDcatalog. Especially at Mid Price. Hopefully these Ten SACDs willbe the first of many. One recording I hope will be issued on SACDis the Berlioz Requiem with Munch, The BSO and Leopold Simoneu.Also Maestro Munch's recording of the Berlioz SymphonieFantastique"
2,Disappointing,"I have heard much about these RCA SACD releases and this is my first purchase and might also be my last. Both the performance and sound quality are at best mediocre, quite the opposite of this disc's reputation.Recording balance is odd: percussions are loud, dry, in your face; winds are next; strings are further back; in other words, it's the opposite of a natural concert hall perspective. It's so unnatural, the performers don't seem to be in the same space.The sound is coarse, perhaps from frequent tape drop outs, or old tapes that were stored improperly.Ensemble playing is untidy, i.e. not together.The above comment relates to the Saint Saens played on CD, not SACD. The Debussy is even worse, sounds like a cassette tape!"
2,Disappointed in the Soundtrack,"Terribly disappointed in the soundtrack. Haven't seen the movie, so I'm approaching it from a different level. Compared with other original soundtracks (I'm a collector), this just wasn't up to the beauty I hoped it would be. Not one I'd sit and listen to for hours and hours. You might like it if you use it to relive the movie, but from a non-viewer's standpoint, it just wasn't a moving experience and, therefore, can't recommend it."
2,lamo,"maybe almost 3 stars...the score is lame, compared to pride & prejudicecan't see how it won an awardbig fan of thibaudet in p&p...did; nothing impressive here"
3,Not Upgrade Material,"This is the first MFSL CD I've purchased that sounds identical to the standard issue, and I've bought dozens over the years. Did I waste my money? No - it'll still be a much sought-after collectible when it goes out of production, regardless of whether it's deserving of such status. So if you're only looking for a sonic upgrade, I'd recommend sticking with your 2000 remix/remaster. If you're a collector, you'll probably want it anyway."
2,"Fast Production, Disappointing Results","The book is definitely biased, as the author admits. Some biased books are OK, but this one is really one-sided and employs such irrational discourse that you wonder how they accepted it as ""academic."" I think the topic was hot at the moment, and the publisher did not carefully read the whole thing. Also how can you explain that a professor committed so many grammatical errors, and the editor let them errors go? You thought that maybe they had real peer review and real editing before publishing. 'Guess a timely book can be published, even if it's biased and uses the style and grammar typically associated with writings of a struggling middle school student. All in all, this one's a mystery."
4,Sample this sampler,"Another quality, and sometimes more interesting, translation disc of Zorn's Masada material benefits from a powerful diversity to help rework these tunes into entirely new songs."
4,Women's Nimble XT shoes,I bought a pair of these shoes a few months ago and LOVE them. They are super comfortable and the Vibram soles have great tread. These shoes feel very stable and the sticky rubber works great on steep rock. I am buying a second pair to have when the first wears out!
3,Not what I expected,I wanted a few starter lists of questions to help get the dialog going for literature classes.
3,It's just okay.,"I wasn't as crazy about this one as I was about Saveur's Authentic French book. The Authentic American book is more a melting pot of recipes. I was expecting well known, classic regional dishes. It was strange to see so many ethnic dishes. Yes, everyone in America is from somewhere, but there are dishes that are old and indigenous to the U.S. I would like to have seen more of those."
