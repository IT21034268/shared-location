5,Excellent Quality,"Sure, sure, MP3 player producers parade the fact that their product can hold hundreds of songs, play movies, walk the dog, etc etc. But, for those people who dont have 500+ favorite songs, can't name 500+ songs, or can't afford more than 500 songs, this MP3 player is for you.IT has an incredible amount of features, many of which are missing from leading players, such as a built in radio, multi-colored backlight, a tempo changer, several supported languages,lyrics display, an equalizer, and more. Admittedly, the manual is written in something resembling Pidgin English, but it is easy to grasp their driftThis is definetly a good choice for people who don't care to listen to day-long playlists."
1,One didn't work,"Bought two MP3 players, one works fine, the other one will talk to my computer but won't turn on. Of course I thought it was the batteries but it still wouldn't work with fresh batteries. I called the 800 number on the package a number of times but got so lost in voice mail hell that I finally gave up."
3,Very sturdy,"Bought it for my brother, and it is still alive, after so many bumps and drops and even soda spilled all over it. Sad it just had so little memory. As a toy its perfect!"
1,a few problems at first,"It is very flimsy. I ordered 2. One of them didn't work at all from the get-go. I was able to get a return authorizationfor a replacement (item comes with a ""6 month warranty"" HA!)Well it has been 2 months now and no response. I've e-mailed several times- no response. I've called customer service and all I get is a voice mail. and No, they don't call back.Guess what? they were slow but sent me a brand new player.both are working fine (so far) so I'll go step back and give it 2 and a half stars.BUT DO NOT GO TO WAL MART TO DOWNLOAD MUSIC because wal-mart's protection label won't work with this player, so you can't play the music."
3,A nice MP3 player,The Select button is a little bit difficult to operate when you press the selection it sometimes don't change. The voice recording is not clear or difficult to pick up at long range. This is a nice player for the price but could be better constructed.
2,"Pretty nice, but...",The controls are a little annoying and it reboots for no reason every once in a while (as noted in other reviews).
2,There all gonna laugh at you....,"I went to Chile with 8 friends and we all decided to each bring one travel book. After our second day in Santiago I don't think my book was even opened. It became an amusing side joke to the trip.Like some of the other reviews, I agree that it caters to a traveller that is not on a strict budget. It did not seem thourough or detalied enough to give the reader options. There were the few recommendations and that was it.On the positive side, the recommendations were good ones. The book simplified scenarios that could be overwhelming with too many options. In many instances it could at least point you in the right direction.If you are buying a book for Chile, I think you can find a more complete book somewhere else that would contain all the information that is in this book."
2,No more than an agglomeration of easily obtainable data,"It would appear that little has gone into this guidebook. The average Spanish-speaking tourist would be able to assemble all the information it contains, by simply going through each tourist information centre. The guide is good and sometimes reads well, but it's not that useful. Just an extra piece of luggage."
2,"Not Quite ""the"" Guide","Having just returned from Chile with this book as my primary reference guide, I found myself continually borrowing other guidebooks. Simply put, it contains too little information. I also found some of the authors' opinons a bit stronger than what I care to have when travelling an unfamiliar country. The two standards, Footprints and Lonely Planet, remain for me the best guides to South American travel. I regretted carrying this one along enough to have donated it to a hostal in Punta Arenas.Admittedly, the guide takes a fun approach, and has interesting and readable content. However, because it lacks the depth of more veteran sources, I recommend this guide only as a supplemental reference."
1,12 letters!?!,"i was going to get this to put ""Animal Lover"" on my wall so I was hoping it came with like 2 of every letter and it doesnt even come with every letter!! It comes with only 12 letters! Dont waste your money!"
2,Me & Mrs Jones,I love the movie and always have but the DVD I received kept freezing and appeared damaged. Should I return it to you to get a replacement?
5,Fast Paced,"I really enjoyed this movie, nice twists , turns and suprises. Great to have a marriage that the couple still loves and understands each other although they know the marraige has really ended. Amicable. Refreshing to see the understanding. Robson Green, enticing as usual."
5,Me and Mrs Jones,Absolutely delightful. Robson Green and cast are right on their marks. Great escapist fare.
5,Charming and Romantic,"I just watched Me & Mrs. Jones and it was a very good movie. In the vein of Sleepless in Seattle, this is a charming little story of finding love where you least expect it. And Robson Green showed once again why he is such a popular actor in Britain. He is very believable in the role and is a joy to watch."
5,Occupy not grass roots as you were told!.,This is areal eye opener. It totally refutes the claim that the Occupy movement was grass roots. It was a highly organized movement with the full support of Obama's administration.
1,David Horowitz thinks everyone is a communist,This is complete fear mongering by far right wing nuts. Doesn't get any crazier than this. The use of cobras toward the middle with the panic inducing horror soundtrack. No wonder people are out of their minds... watching crap like this.
1,About what you would expect,"A Pretty horrible, boring attempt to paint Wall Street as the good guys. Hard to believe anybody would go through such trouble to pretend that the obvious isn't true."
1,THE WORST DOC EVER!,"This documentary does not deserve that name, since it does not document anything.It is a radical right wing propaganda. A couple of neurons should be enough to realize about its constant lies.Don`t waste your time watching it, unless you want to make fun of a few fascists trying to look intelligent."
1,Citizens United Documentary,"I started to watch this documentary, but when I saw that it was a Citizens United production I did not. I was hoping to see some unbiased information(if there is such an animal), but with my understanding of this group I'm not going to watch anything they have put out, there are just too many worthwhile things to do with my time."
1,Smells bad,I didn't watch it. I also didn't eat a dog turd posing as a Baby Ruth bar. I'll stick a little paper American flag in it if you want. Bon Appetit.
5,Beware the negative reviews....,"I'll bet big money, ""1 Percenter"" big money these goons haven't even watched the documentary. There has been a campaign/agenda set forth by liberal propaganda groups to flood the internet and spread lies. Some are paid to do this, some just wish to do their part in bringing America to our knees. Watch for it. Recognize it. Rebut it."
5,Eye opening movie.,Makes me miss Andrew Breitbart all the more. Powerful words from David Horowitz who knows the all about the leftist indoctrination in academia from his years of being an outspoken adherent of the left before rejecting Leftism completely.
5,Outstanding,There isn't that much new information for the already informed but it should be very imformative for those who get all their news from the MSM. It's very well done and hopefully it will do what it was intended to do and that's wake people up.
2,A misguided movement as seen through a right-wing lens,"This documentary does a great job at capturing all the negative aspects of what I consider a pretty aimless movement. The problem I have with this documentary is that it's clearly ONLY capturing the ugly side. It's also laughable how they never define what they consider ""mainstream media"". I will assume they base their truth on things like FOX news as their foundation. This could have been a great film but they obviously have their own agenda to fulfill. If you are a conservative you'll probably love it. If you are an objective thinker don't waste your time."
2,Mainstream media lighting matches,"""And there's raping, and pillaging and POOPING and the mainstream media is ignoring it""Bwahaha might be the funniest quote I have seen in a documentaryBut yeah this documentary is hilarious in that it is aimed at a target audience and uses language that shows that. I was honestly expecting better after watching the first 10 minutes or so in terms on the video clips that they showed. But the main narrator was hilarious and very biased. Apparently community organizers are bad. And if you think CEOs get paid too much you want to overthrow the government and are against all that we stand for. Thought that there would be more in here about the linkages between different organizations and their work in organizing Ocuppy Wall Street. But all you get is demonizing / generalizing of everyone there.Another ""Take That!"" people I don't agree with type of movie."
2,not bad for a comedy,"Lots of stretching to connect points, footage is really selective. Not looking to fully review this film but felt it fair to say that if you don't enjoy the kind of misinterpretation that alarmism does so well, this may not be the movie for you. The scary dramatic music punctuating all the A-Ha moments made me laugh though. So there's that."
5,Breitbart Nails Occupy--Well done,"Don't miss this one folks. I wish we had Andrew Breitbart with us today, but he did leave this legacy of a film. It's a must see. You won't be disappointed. Whether you lean right or left, this is worth seeing. We all don't always know what we think we know. 10 Thumbs Up"
1,Really? A documentary about Occupy funded by Citizens United,A documentary about Occupy funded by Citizens United? That must be joke right? I really wonder if they will tell a neutral story about this movement...
3,Occupy Unmasked,"These people are sick and want to destroy our country. Yes, Wall Street deserves some of this anger, but living in such filth, violence and anarchy is not the way to get this country back on track. The young people of today don't have the values that we were raised with--it's frightening. God rest Andrew Beritbart's soul. He tried so hard to show what was happening in our beloved country. So glad his good work will be continued."
1,Right wing propaganda,"What a joke. If you think Fox new is fair and balanced then this film is for you. Obviously a skewed unbalanced view of a movement that should be a wake up call. Compare the bloggers and small time journalist who ""organized"" this ""unorganized"" protest according to this films makers to the Kotch brothers on the right, hardly a fair fight. Even with there manipulation of the facts and events its obvious this movement is about the masses confronting the billionaires who are buying our government and planting this kind of disinformation in the media."
5,"Great Movie, Scary Findings","Downloaded this on my Amazon Fire before my flight to watch while in the air. Great movie in documentary style but quick paced. The findings are more revealing than anything the deceptive main stream media did and will ever report about the Occupy ""Movement"" or the Unions behind them. Scary findings, but I encourage every one to watch this movie and draw your own conclusions and not be fed the lies of the media. Highly recommend this movie."
5,Great Documentary,This movie is an eye opener. I would recommend everyone watch it. It is well edited and very informative. I believe it tells the truth and it backs up the information with loads of video taken at the occupy movement. You can't deny the accuracy of this documentary.
1,Nonsensical,This doesn't even try to tie any of the statements it makes (without evidence) the majority of the film together in any coherent way.
1,Want my time back,"I was really hoping for a documentary, but instead I got an blatant propaganda piece. Most of what is talked about doesn't have much for facts to back it up, but it is full of conspiracy theories and accusations. I wish I could get back the hour + time I spent time watching this one-sided story. Even in that hour there is a huge amount of repetitive clips and rehashing of the same statements.If you are looking for a documentary with facts behind the Occupy movement regardless of your political beliefs; this isn't your video."
1,Your all a bunch of Morons,You people who give this 5 stars its just ridiculous. Your all a bunch of Morons if you believe this crap
1,I call Bull Sh*t,"Some aspects of the movie MAY have been filmed at an OWS event, however they also may have been filmed at Mardi Gras, the Boston Marathon or a Greatful Dead concert.Some OWS demonstrations had elements of drug use, vandalism, etc however what large organized demonstration in history did not?! OWS demonstrators of today certainly have been better behaved than the Vietnam demonstrators of yesterday.Before taking to heart any alleged documentary one must consider the source:In this case Citizens United. Citizens United is a .org founded by corporations who encourage & profit by the corruption of banking and government.I think it would behoove people to watch this film AFTER doing some research on Citizens United. I think you'll agree it is a Monsanto-style bully cloaked as a .org"
1,Media in the 21st century.,"It's sad to see what the media has become in the 21st century. This video like others of it's ilk do nothing more than prove the responsible journalism is dead.If the producers had been alive in '69, all we would have known what happened on Yasgur's farm was a bunch of people got high and had sex. It seems that today everyone has an agenda and wants to the slant facts to suit their purposes."
1,Badly written propaganda,This is a pitiable attempt at propaganda. This video reeks of desperation and fear of everyday people. Not too mention the pathetic self advertising of the five star reviews. Hire some better writers because your people emulate movie reviews not real people. It is shameful that they will stoop so low.
1,Objective reporting fail.,"This is what you get when you cherry-pick sources to spin into the story you want to report on, instead of the story that is actually there."
1,ROTFL!!!,I haven't seen a comedy like this since Reefer Madness was used to damn the use of hemp! These people need to write political speeches for Romney (right after he gets windows he can open in his plane for air when they gasp from laughing about people actually believing this tripe!). Ouch ouch! I've compound fractures of my funny bone! :-)
1,Is this film for real? Thought it was a spoof.,Claiming Obama and the left are supporting this cause is a joke. The OWS movement is not affiliated with any political group. They hate Obama as much as Romney. They hate politics. They are sick and tired of big business buying and marketing our political figures in this country. A movie about Obama being a Muslim and a baby eater would have been more believable.
2,is this serious or satire?,I can understand the point of view. What I don't understand is the leap from speculation to fact. Propaganda does where many guises and in this film it wears a bikini.
1,Right wing alarmist propaganda,"This is right wing propaganda, pure and simple. It's nothing more than an attempt to help lay the ground for a fascist reaction if such a thing becomes necessary for the ruling class to hang on to power. Their fear that such a thing might occur, especially after seeing huge social explosions like Occupy and the earlier movement in Madison, not to mention the mass resistance to austerity in Europe and throughout the rest of the world, is what prompted the creation of this movie and others like it. Goebbels would be proud."
1,"insanity, the film","After watching this film, I am at a loss of what to think. On one hand it is a thrilling introduction to the ridiculous mind of the American conservative. On the other it is a plainly fraudulent film made by a director with little respect for fact checking or unedited interviews. If you're a birther, tea-party member, or libertarian nutcase, I heartily recommend this film. If you have any respect for your own sanity, you should avoid this film at all costs."
3,violence is never a solution but a problem itself,this movie shows how ignorance being used as a tool by organizers or leaders. and ignorance leads to violence... you are your own leader.example of protesters who only speaking what they know they think is the solution but not the solution but a problem. people protest because of ignorance. there is a saying that being a poor is a sin. that educating our children that what they know or see is not always the right thing and make your own path .. how media causes people to glamorize violence and radical thinking and belief that its the right thing. this movie open up the reality that everyone is a hypocrite ...
1,very unprofesional,"I was hoping to see a documentary about the occupy movement. Instead I watch propaganda probably finance by the Koch brother and the Republican Party telling me how beautiful capitalism is, that the 2008 financial crisis never happens, ordinary folks didnt loose their homes and the banks didnt profit from that tragedy. So the occupy movement its not a reaction against injustice but a diabolic plan from the mind of the most dangerous anarchist since Bakunin, supported by that evil reincarnation of Stalin: Barack Obama."
1,Clearly biased...,"First, I am against OWS.... However, this documentary was clearly biased. They picked the dumbest occupiers to interview in a lame attempt to make their responses seem representative of the whole movement. Same thing with the footage, hordes of savages pooping on the streets and raping their fellow occupiers... Finally, the host (or director of the documentary- I don't know who he was... that chubby guy with beard) was a boring version of a Michael Moore from the right. I also found him annoying every time he tried to instigate fear among impressionable United Statians. If you are gullible, you might enjoy this documentary... but it'll also scare the s^^t out of you..."
1,this is not reporting ... it is a one-sided perspective and you surely know which side they took,certainly can't call this balanced reporting ... how about crapumentary film-making? many subtle clues as well as plenty of blatant in your face commentary shows there is only one viewpoint being presented. i could only watch the first quarter before starting to feel dizzy from all the spinning of the truth going on. sigh ... freedom of speech is a wonderful thing but it certainly means wasting a lot of time wading through crap to get at the truth.
5,Stunning the degree to which globalists want the Republic to fail....,"Have you started educating yourself yet?Have you discovered that the American youth are being used as tools for Progressives?Have you figured out that Countries around the Globe cannot wait to say to Americans, 'we told you it wouldn't work'.... 'capitalism just doesn't work'?Do vote without knowing who the players are?Then you vote irresponsibly."
5,Great Work by Breitbart,"A large percentage of the nation does not realize what the truth is, Breitbart, God bless his soul, sheds light on the subject revealing many truths."
4,"Good, a little frenetic","Good exposure of the union's role in the Occupy movement and good exposition of the seedy, sleazy and even criminal elements that made up the participants (e.g., the rapes that took place). I recommend this video and hope its coverage and explicit and implied messages help remove much of the polish accorded to and undeserved by these people."
2,Disappointed,I myself have participated in the Occupy protests with my daughter. It seems like they weren't capturing the essence of what it really was. It seems like they were trying to compare it to a bunch of conspiracy theories concerning E.L.F. which is not what Occupy was to us at all. It's not a true representation of the movement through the protesters eyes. Damn disappointing.
1,Faker than Faux News,"Harry Potter, The Wizard of Oz, and Alice in Wonderland are each based on more truth than this half-witted attempt to discredit the human spirit."
3,I am Homayon,"I am Homayon from Iran , and I have Ms in industrial engineering from Middel east Technical university of Turkey-Ankara, I'm working in a forging company as a system analizer , and I extermly dealed with the Quality Management systems in my company"
4,Just what we ordered,"Of course the movie speaks for itself. If you are a fan of Monty Python then you already know the movie. We ordered as a surprise for my husband who loves, loves, loves Monty Python and could not find this movie anywhere ""to rent"". Received in 2 days and was a well received surprise."
3,It's alright,"It does about as good of a job as liquid skin. If it get wet, it wears off.I did not buy this for human use. Quality on humans, I can not say how it does. I do know when getting it on my fingers, I can just rub my fingers together, it balls up and comes off easily. Again, my intentions were not for the use of humans.I bought this item to help prop my dobie's ears up. It does not leave marks, pull hair as many other methods do. It is easy to use. However it if get wets, it will not hold. For my dobie, I am reapplying it every other day fully and on smaller areas every day. It holds up as well as liquid skin does (which can be bought at walmart @ $5, dollar tree @ $1, dollar general @ $2.50).If you are planning on using this for propping up a dog's ears, I would recommend buying the surgical glue that vet's use. It does hold up longer.Again, I can not say how it works on humans."
1,Does not bond,The product is useless. It does not bond. Too costly to return as postage is too costly. so disposed of it in the rubbish. Very disappointed with product.
5,Nice and sharp,"I am not sure why Amazon has these #11 scalpel blades listed as a ""toy"" but... These are high quality and extremely sharp blades and the tip is needle sharp. They are oiled & bulk packed in a tiny little box so the only negative I can think of is that they are slightly difficult sometimes to separate from one another but other than that they are great and the bulk pack really gets the price per blade down."
4,Seamless work by two wonderful authors,"I haven't read any of either of these authors works before and was a bit worried about reading a book finished by another author. This work, however, is seamless. I couldn't tell you where the plotting and characterization or even the writing styles are knit together.Set in the Central Valley of California, a botanist for the county meets a retired country singer and stumbles across the shallow grave of a long dead body. This book mixes music (the Bakersfield sound), botany, and a strong sense of place to come up with a fascinating murder mystery.If you're a fan of Rebecca Rothenberg's I can' imagine you'll be disappointed...and if you haven't read her books before, you'll be compelled to go dig them up."
5,Last Time on TV was 1964-65 Season,"As a fan and collector of classic TV shows I can't wait to purchase this DVD set. The only time I remember watching this situation comedy or sitcom, was during the 1964-65 TV season and I was eight years old. It's been almost fifty years since I last seen this show so it will be interesting to watch it (again). Considering I don't remember any of the episodes (except for the opening titles) it will be like watching a new series."
3,A crying shame not all the episodes are on this DVD,"Item arrived quickly and in perfect shape; but I sure wish the complete series was on the DVD. Oh well, can't have everything! Very happy with my purchase otherwise!"
2,"GOOD IDEA , AHEAD OF IT'S TIME , BUT STILL A DUD","The My Living Doll series starred Julie Newmar as the Rhoda AF-709 , the sexiset dingbat Fembot ever ! This B&W sitcom only lasted for one year because it suffered from terrible scripts and awfully unfunny comedy writers that had no sense of humor whatsoever . Buyer Beware , of the 26 episodes that were shown between 1964-65 , only 11 made it to the two dvd's . You are not getting the entire series . Many episodes were either lost or not restorable . As My Living Doll left the airwaves in 1965 , a similar and more successful sitcom arrived . That of course was I Dream Of Jeannie . I would recommend My Living Doll to diehard Julie Newmar fans only ."
2,"""BUMMER- Only 11 Episodes""","Absolutely no reason to do this, it's a 30 minute show and only 26 episodes in the series so why not put the whole thing in one package-- ""GREED"". This first set has 11 episodes so they can keep it. I don't care how rare it is,I'm not paying this much for 11 half hour shows."
2,I thought this was a blowup doll,"This product is not what is advertised and so don't believe Craig from Michigan. I thought I was getting a Lifelike Living Doll that looked like the chick on the package when I bought this. I couldn't believe it was some stupid TV show. The ad clearly says ""My Living Doll"" and I was looking forward to hours of fun with my beautiful gorgeous blow up doll. I was going to invite Craig from Michigan to come down for the weekend and have a fun party with my Living Doll and me. So much for that idea. I then found out that some idiots named JA Driscoll and Bob Stoll caused the company that produced the Rhoda blow-up dolls to stop making them because they were fornicating in public with them."
5,Magical,"We checked out this book at the library because it was one of the books on a list of autumn-themed books to read. I knew I'd enjoy it, but was skeptical that my active three-year-old would. He's only recently started sitting still long enough to be read to, and only for very short stories. Well, imagine my surprise when this book became his absolute favorite! He asks for it to be read to him multiple times a day, he finishes many of the sentences for me...and he likes to talk about the characters even when we're not reading the book. The illustrations are exquisite and the characters charming. My son especially likes September, the mischievous little fellow who leads Christopher around the garden in search of his missing ball. I think he really identifies with his pranksterish spirit!"
5,My kids still enjoy this book,"My boys are now 12 and 8. We've had this book on our shelf for years, and they really enjoyed it when they were younger. A few days ago the younger boy asked me to read it to him again, and imagine my surprise when the older one perched on the arm of the chair and eagerly looked at all the pictures! This book is truly special. It depicts boys who are gentle and in tune with nature, and the pictures are beautiful.I have included this book in my online Gender Equality Bookstore."
5,Beautiful,"These books and illustrations could not be more beautiful. Every child should be exposed to at least one Elsa Beskow book, preferable more."
3,This course is only 'ok' at best....,"They try to do a good job but everything is so watered down that it didn't help me that much. The course is funny though, and that is good. Oh and like another reviewer said...the title of the course is VERY MISLEADING. There are no Calculus 2 topics in this DVD set. It is all calculus 1."
3,Too many cooks spoil the soup.,"I saw this set and was intrigued enough to try it out. The presentation is by a number of folks who try to sound chirpy and funny. Sadly they fail on both counts. My guess is the production is meant to go after the high school crowd using MTV tactics of folks interjecting points rapidly in and out. I understand that the material was for High School kids but this was patronizing even to high schoolers. After a while the many ""explanations"" by different folks got old and distracting. I am sure many kids will see through the gimmick and get bored or worse turn the thing off.If you want a good INTORDUCTORY calculus course on DVD go with Jason Gibson's ""Calculus 1 & 2 Tutor"" and for a more advanced treatment go with his ""Advanced Calculus Tutor"". One more thing - the stuff on this set is Calc 1 only - not 1 & 2."
2,First Disappointment From Amazon,"The battery itself comes covered with a bar coded sticker on it. Dumb, dumb, dumb. As a result it is slightly too thick to slide easily in and out of the battery compartment of my Lumix DMC-FX9. Stuck it in and had to get a pair of tweezers with really sharp points to pull it back out. The sticker got torn, but no junk was left in the battery compartment. This left me with an option I knew would be less than desirable -- removing the sticker. Of course it left an enormous amount of glue from the backing all over the battery. Now the battery is a sticky mess. I refuse to stick it in the camera. I am going to now have to clean it up with nail polish remover or cooking oil or something before I can use it.Stupid, stupid, stupid. The battery comes in a small plastic box. Couldn't the sticker have been placed on that?Would not buy again."
1,Battery explodes inside camera,"When the camera showed low battery charge, we opened the compartment to change it. Battery would not come out as it usually does. I had to remove it using very fine tools so I would not break the camera. The battery was ""swollen"" and gone forever. Hi-Capacity is not a brand I will buy again nor would I recommend to anyone!"
3,Ordered this battery because the site suggested it with the new camera. Wrong size battery..,Ordered this battery because the site suggested it with the new camera. Wrong size battery..
2,a lesson,"Overall, I enjoy to buy my staff from amazon. However, I changed the payment in this item, and it create a big trouble to me. I paid 25 dollars for payment delay and received very unfriendly call from TRF.I learn a lesson from this item."
1,NEVER RECEIVED THIS ITEM,This merchandise -- although paid for -- has never been recevied. I still need a battery and havn't known who to call to request a shipment of this product!!Please send one asap as I will need to use the camera next week.Karen Jellsion(858) 688-2915
3,Guiding Lites for Boiler Operators,"This book provides a good basic understanding of boiler operations on a wide variety of boilers. It is geared towards the novice operator or for as a learning guide. The depth is somewhat limited and is not supported by any theory. The author describes the overall process but does not get into optimizing the boiler, which every operator should do.This reading is not meant to be entertaining or for light reading, but a study guide for the operator..."
4,Boiler operators guide - a must have,"I am currently studying for a New Zealand Boiler Attendants National Certifificate level 2 (for operating boilers up to 6MW)and have been operating for over 2 years. I wish I'd had this book before I sent my last 2 assignments in. I would thoroughly recommend this book for any operator.Only negative I have is the lack of metric units, but that does'nt detract from the usefullnes of this book."
4,"Excellent as a Learning Tool, but not enough to get your license","This book is an excellent learning tool for new boiler/plant operators. It gives a basic understanding of most aspects of Plant operation. Unfortunately, the generalized nature of the book doesn't lend itself to answer specific questions an inexperienced yet knowledgeable person might have. My point is, this book can give you an overview of everything you need to learn about operating a steam plant, but it won't be enough to prepare you for a tough licensing exam. As a guide and a place to start, this book is excellent and a must read for people wishing to enter the world of stationary engineering. Just remember you'll need more when you're done with this one."
1,Boiler Operators Guide,I purchased this book on January 9th. I received confirmation it shipped and should receive January 13th. I have not received it yet. Still waiting!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Bored to tears.,I was really looking forward to the 4th book in the series. But could not get through this 3rd book. I was so bored. I quit reading 1/2 way through. It just did not go anywhere! It was just inside personal struggle that did not stop..... it just went on and on and on.
3,Warrant Live 86-97 (Re-packaged),"This 2005 Warrant live album is the ""Warrant Live 86-97"" album from 1997 re-packaged and re-released with 10 of the 16 tracks and also remixed. The album was released at a good time as the band had no albums to release in 2005 and is also only the 2nd live album from the band, even if it is basicaly the first live album re-packaged again."
1,failed actron circuit tester,I needed a circuit tester so instead of buying a cheap one at $3 I decided to get what I thought would be a good one at $20 - well I finally took my Actron out of the package for use and it does not work so I went to the store and got a $3 unit that works!
5,A family film.,It's a good story on how a group of kids became enriched by entering the world of chess.
3,Feel good movie.,"Entertaining movie with decent plot and acting. While predictible, the story is enjoyable and actors perform well enough.Fans of Ted Danson will enjoy him in this role."

1,Delivery???,I never received this product and no one seems to know what happened to it or what to do??? My students were disappointed.
4,I'm a sex magnet,"This jacket singlehadedly improved my sex life. In one night, because I was wearing this jacket, I took part in a 17some and a 14some. Apart from the slight shedding of the jacket on the inside, I have no complaints. I am a one man honey badger."
3,Difficult to Focus,"Material is boring enough, unfortunately, this publication does not make it any more thrilling. It is a cost effective study tool, however."

4,Still good 10 years later,"I read this book when I was 12 years old and the Cowboys had won their first of 3 Super Bowls in the 90's. I loved it but, then again, I would have loved a bottle of poison if it had a Cowboys star on it.I picked it up again about a year ago when I was thinking about what made that team (and champion teams in general) tick. The psychological edge those teams enjoyed is probably what made the difference, to which Jimmy Johnson deserves the ultimate credit.His approach to the mental side of football is evident in this book. For example, instead of telling a kicker ""don't miss"" before a good field goal, Jimmy will always say ""make this."" The difference is the seed, either positive or negative, that is planted in that kicker's mind.But the book goes beyond coaching philosophy to chronicle the interesting, if not a little whacky, life of an extremely sucessful football coach."
4,Jimmy,I know they all glorify themselves but this seems fairly even sided. A good read for football. Could have been a little more telling but Jimmy did bash some of the guys we fans would not like either. Worth it to see how coaches are so over rated.
2,"Great Hair, Great Ego","If you're a Cowboy, Hurricane or Johnson fan, this book is for you. You'll probably find his stories and self-adoration amusing and inspiring. I'm a college coach and always try to find another perspective through which I can learn or grow. Johnson's book didn't do that for me, so I see this as more of a hero-worship read than anything about leadership."
4,"Great book, decent price.","A really great ""condensed"" version of the marketing classic, that should have some decent shelf-life, social media notwithstanding. My copy arrived in pristine condition."
4,Just what I needed,The book was just what I needed for my MBA class. It arrived in a timely manner and was in the position described by seller.
3,"It's good, but the discribution of it should be more specific","Actually, it's an international version.Therefore,the saler should mark this on his or her remarks."
2,"A Framework for Marketing Management, Second Edition",I ordered this book over 1 month ago - I have NOT received it yet. I am wondering what happened.
3,What a waste of money,"My teacher during MBA did her PhD under Kotler. So she was kind of under the gun to make us use this book. Granted that Kotler is condidered a god of marketing. But the book is too overpriced for the content, I would recommed buying only used copies that sell for less than $10"
2,Might as well directly give your school the money.,"My complaint with this book centers around the content you get for over $100. Is it worth it? No. Frankly I don't see anything in this text that hasn't already been communicated better and for less money through other sources. While that tends to hold true for most college texts, it's particularly egregious in this case.Frankly, I'm sensitive to the irony of being forced to overpay for a marketing text."
4,School book,I wouldn't have purchased this book for fun. It is pretty dry for a Marketing book but it was way cheaper then buying it for mu UMUC class. In great condition too for a used book.
3,Disappointing comic stuff,Tame stories with some decent artwork and few stories that actually entertain. Really a disappointment.I prefer Not Brand Echh or reprints of EC Mad stories.
5,Good Earth Lighting 13 Watt Light Fixture,The product was easy to install and link together. The light bulb provided emits a slightly yellowish tinge. I would recommend this to a friend.
4,Satisfied,"A Bit Yellow, But a nice little light for the money.using it for above my computer center that has an enclosureover the desk. the light is just the right brightness not tooverpower my monitor."
3,In full agreement with a couple of the reviews.,"I am in agreement with the reviewer who said the plug is loose. It really is, can't mess around with on/off switch, plug loosens and light goes out. Also in agreement with reviewer who talked about brackets being hard to remove. Foolishly, I turned the light on and just held it under the kitchen cabinet where it was to be installed. After installing, I found the light glaring in my eyes. Through much hassle (and cussing!), I finally got the brackets removed, pulled them back in shape and re-installed further back. It's a nice light, but I find it much too white and bright for me, now looking around for something softer and not so glaring."
3,Works. Cheap.,"I bought a couple of these to provide indoor lighting for seedlings. They would maybe be better in an application (typical undercounter, etc) where you put them up and never touch them again. Less likely to fall apart that way. The electrical connection doesn't fit well and has to be jiggled with when the lamp blinks out - every time this happens the whole thing looks like it could come apart. Shoddy - but you get what you pay for, right? The little T5 lamps are not cheap, though, and cost nearly as much as the fixture. Three stars is about a half star fat."
2,Yellow and not bright enough,"I bought this to mount it on the shelf over my workbench. But it is very disappointing. It shines a weak yellow light instead of white! For me, it is definitely not bright enough for a workbench, even with two more. I am glad that I just ordered one to try. For those who use it under cabinet, I guess it is fine and mounting is super easy."
2,"easy to install, works, but flimsy","Got these for under our kitchen cabinets. They are super easy to install - two screws for two brackets that the light snaps into, which don't have to be meticulously spaced. Just anywhere along the length of the tube is fine. I loved that the light came with an enclosure to cover the bulb tube - a real bargain, even if it's just thin plastic. What I don't like is that the connectors for the power cord are very loose. Half the time, I have to wiggle the cord after I turn on the light to get it to come on. Also, when you link these, you have to turn each light on individually. It doesn't work to just turn on and off the first one in the chain. This is both a plus and a con at the same time. We will eventually replace these, but for now, they are working well enough and are plenty of bright."
4,good,"work good. easy enough to install. Would like a little more light output, but it's still pretty good."
5,Good Earth 21-1/2 Inch light fixture works as expected,Easy to install below shelf above my workbench and bright enough because only 3 feet above my bench top. Thinking of buying another one for other work areas.
5,Gotz Sarah Ballerina from Friendly Co.,"Gotz 19.5"" Ballerina Sarah Doll with Blonde hair and Blue EyesI bought the Gotz Sarah Ballerina from Friendly Co. for my little sister for Christmas. It was very well packed and shipped super fast, and arrived by Christmas !!!! Thanks to all the hard working people at Friendly Co. to make sure this doll arrived on time. She is a wonderful play doll and high quality doll that will give years of play to any child. I highly recommend her, and the Friendly Co., to anyone thinking of getting her.Thanks so much for the wonderful Christmas gift !!!!!Nathan Weiler"
5,jaw is still on the floor.......,The Frogs prove once again that they are masters at whatever type of music / subject matter they wish to tackle. This is their most mainstream album yet and hopefully this will finally get them some of the credit they so richly deserve.
2,Surprised for sure,"Like The Frogs first album, this CD contains some catchy sounding, Beatlesque pop-songs (the only thing that saves this album that from getting 1 star). However, when you are the Undisputed Kings of sacastic, insulting, hilarious songs like the Frogs can only write, who really cares. Anyone who is a fan of their music from albums such as ""My Daughter the Broad"", ""Racially Yours"", ""It's Only Right and Natural"", ""Bananimals"", and the hundreds off other ""Made-Up Songs"" would agree to this, even if pains them to do so.It's like King Crimson or Yes putting out a Hardcore Rap album. Disappointing.We know you guys are talented musicians; but, if you are decisive in taking this musical path, you will isolate your small (yet dedicated; but not THAT dedicated) fan base faster than you can say ""Grandma in the corner with a p***s is her hand saying 'No, No, No, No, No'""."
4,"It was great. Better than ""Cats""...",This book captured the essence of the Louvre. It is the perfect resource for those too time-poor to make the trek to Paris. You will want to read it while you have your morning espresso in a sidewalk cafe.
2,A good guide for and advanced art afficionado.,"It is a small book that is easy to carry with most, if not all, the art treasures included. The problem is that the pictures are small and the writing is too. Without being there I didn't feel comfortable trying to decipher and read it."
4,"The Louvre in your ""pocket""?","Very informative, but not quite as portable as one would really like. A little large for a pocket, but okay for a purse or backpack."
1,Problematic,"I have owned a Roomba since they came out, and loved it. Based on that I bought a Scooba. It has been a great disappointment. My first 6 times using it I had to call customer support every other time. Problems have included it needing to be primed (they sent me a bulb to prime it), problems with the battery charger (killed batteries, they sent a new battery and tool to reprogram my Scooba), and just not working(they replaced the enire unit once). I recently bought a new battery as the second one lasted about 1 year (about 6 uses). On the new battery I've gotten one use, and I'm having problems, again. I would not buy one again, at any price.Please don't repeat my mistake. It looks like some of these work, but my experience has been very poor."
1,I wanted to love this product so badly but . . .,"I love gadgets so I really, really wanted to love this product from the minute I saw it on tv and in action at one of my friend's apartment. But in less than 2 years, over $350 later, I was regretfully informed by the customer service rep that there is nothing I could do about my scooba's failure to charge. The first few months of using this product on my wood floor apartment, I loved it, but after about 3 months I noticed problems with it stopping, not squirt any water or beeping that it needed more water when the tank was full. I called in about 3 different times for various little problems I was having with it, and tonight was told that there was nothing left for me to do but to buy another one at a discounted price. It's back to the swiffer."
4,Wow. Scooba is great,"What a great tool. We live in a house with seven dogs so we do a lot of floor cleaning. Scooba makes it so easy it's almost like not having to do the floors at all. It would be nice if the unit came with a remote or it sensed when it was going to need service, which usually happens when it is on the other side of the room. Then you either have to wait for the floors to dry or leave foot prints on them to get the scooba. Other thsn that its really works great. I highly recommend it."
4,neat little cleaner,"When we opened it and put it together, there was a disappointing couple of hours when we had to wait for the first charge. When we plugged it in, it said ""check tank"", but there was nothing wrong. After a few searches on the internet and taking the tank on and off, it eventually started working.The Good:It really works! While rated for about 200 sq. ft., ours does 400-500 feet pretty well. Also: effortless. Spend a few seconds filling it up, a couple of minutes cleaning it out when done, and push a couple of buttons in the middle.The ""not so"" Good:Loud - sounds like a hair dryer going around. Requires a little floor prep: sweep first, or get a roomba to get the dust bunnies first. The Scooba WILL catch dirt in a small trap, but it's not that big. It cleans pretty well with the Clorox solution, but does OK with the vinegar suggestion as long as it's not too dirty. Also: it was temperamental out of the box.On the whole, don't let the bads out-weigh the goods. Pretty neat device!"
3,Good---when it works,"Mine worked for about a year, then died. When it worked, it was amazing. It did a great job on my wood floors, and I liked the smell that it left behind. I also enjoyed watching my cats ""attack"" it, then run away when it ""chased"" them. Then it died. I bought a kit to clean it, replaced filters and other parts--pointless. I then mailed it back to the company but the company says that it never arrived. So I have a lot of cleaning fluid that I need to find another use for and a bunch of useless accessories. I will not be buying another one of these things."
1,Worst Product I Ever Bought,"I have owned a Roomba for several years, and have been very pleased with its performance, so I was very excited to purchase the Scooba. However, it has been the worst purchase that I ever made. The first one that I received would quit working every time it bumped into furniture or the wall. iRobt did send a replacement, but it only works about half of the time. The other half of the time, it does not vacuum up the dirty water, so it leaves the floor dirtier than before I ""cleaned"" it. I have contacted iRobot for help, but none of their suggestions have worked. Honestly, I would throw it in the trash if it did not cost so much."
1,Will Try a second one,"The wife and I have severe back problems and the doctors tell us that we can't push a vacuum or mop so I bought this plus the vacuum model 560. This vacuum is absolutely outstanding. I dumped a bunch of stuff on the carpet to see if it would miss anything and it didn't, and when done it reutrned to the home base and connected to the charger. This floor washer didn't work at all so I am returning it to Amazon but selected a replacement vs. refund because the vacuum works so good. Maybe I just got a bum floor washer so I'm willing to give the washer another try."
4,good for floor tiles,"Good service, fast shipping. The Scooba robot is very good for the floor tiles but wooden floor because it leaves wet spots along. I've bought 2 of these and had a problem with one of them - couldn't open the trunk after the use. The return process was very easy and quick, no questions asked. The new one works perfectly. Over all I am happy with the purchase."
1,iRobot makes defective products,"I have bought three roombas and two scoobas and not one of them has lasted more than one year. I love the idea, but they have terrible designs. The scooba is particularly bad as the design allows water to easily corrode the electrical parts that are not replaceable. Customer Service is terrible and tells you to buy another one. I expect an appliance to last more than one year and to be serviceable. Shame on you iRobot."
1,Buyer beware!,"I have owned for over two years and it has only worked about 5 or 6 times during that period. When it works, it takes so many attempts and so much work that I could mop the floor manually in less time. There are always error messages that cause so much frustation.We have also owned 3 Roombas that have each worked for a short time but eventually fail. The maintenance required and the expensive battery replacements negate the positive benefits of these robots.The concept is good but the engineering is faulty."
3,Its ok but requires a lot of cleaning an maintenance and spare parts.,"It is ok but requires a lot of cleaning and maintenance and spare parts.Within 18 months of usage it was no longer servicable, had to replace the water tank twice as the handle broke off and the water valves broke.I hope the next version is better as I love the concept of a mopping robot."
2,I have to fix it every time I use it.,"Did they tell you that you have to prime the pump if it dries out? No they didn't; and their online-only directions for doing so don't work. It's great when it works, but if you only use it monthly it will constantly dry out or clog up. If you're not up to fixing it then don't buy it. (hints: pour water on the floor in front of it to help prime the pump. If that doesn't work attach a bicycle pump to the inlet to prime it. finally, watch that the screen inside the tank doesn't clog.) I love my roomba, but not the scooba."
1,worked great...while it worked,This is my second iRobot. I loved them when they worked but they both died pretty quickly. The iRobot scubawas especially effective at cleaning floors but it broke so quickly and covered such a small area it was a bit of a pain. it definitely was not worth the money.My sister had another iRobot and it broke in not time too. Would be a great product if they lasted more than 6 months.
2,"Only Good for linoleum floors, not for tiles","When I first got this, I was pleased that I wouldn't have to clean the kitchen floor anymore and even though I feel that it leaves the floor too wet, I didn't mind.However, after using this on a weekly basis after 2 months, I noticed that the corners where it can't get to is still white while the rest of the kitchen grout is grey. Now I have to use the steam cleaner and bleach to get my grout back to white again. On linoleum floors it will work better."
1,Grossly overpriced junk Not very serviceable.,While working it was okay. But left trails or marks on hard floors which dried and remained noticable. After several washes it just died. All lights come on and will not work. Replaced battery but will not work. Irobot are greed mongers. No help there. In short unit does not have bugs worked out and is not usable. Way too much money for a plastic piece of junk that has durability issues.
2,Scooba 5800,"I purchased an iRobot Scooba that I only use a couple times a year. The manual did not tell me to take out the battery and not continually charge it. So here I am out of warranty and only having used the unit less than a dozen times, having to buy a new battery and software upgrade at almost $70.00. You cannot get the software upgrade without buying the battery from iRobot. I have been a customer of iRobot and have owned several Roombas and the Scooba. They used to stand behind their products, but no longer-so beware!"
1,Battery problems seems hopless,"As many other have complained about it kills it's batteries. It cleans the floor just fine, and though it's still work to keep the Scooba itself clean I like it when it worked. However it's first battery managed to clean the floor about a dozen times before it dies and would only run the Scooba for a few minutes. They sent a free replacement batter, and a re programmer, and new charging instructions. (don't leave it plugged in) contrary to the instructions that shipped with it. (leave it plugged in always).however the second battery only lasted about a dozen cleanings and then dies as well, now it's just an boat anchor in my closet."
3,I give it a C+,"I think that this is a fantastic little device. I would keep it and use it expect it would only be good for one room in my house. The problem is that it really gets hung up on rugs and while it tries to get off the rugs it displaces an excessive amount of water around the rug leaving a real mess. Since my entire house is hardwoods with rugs (except the tiled bathrooms which I am skeptical it will work on at all) this does not work for me. However, I think that it did a very good job in the kitchen which has a lot of difficult angles to clean. I just took the chairs out the kitchen and let it go..."
3,Not in love with Scooba anymore,"Bottom line, I bought this from HSN for my christmas present to myself 2 yrs ago. I contacted Irobot this past december because all it would do was spin in circles. They gave me 3 different causes based on the beeps it gives when it stops. All 3 were different parts, in the end i ended up chucking it in the trash. So far Ive owned 5 (4 roombas and 1 scooba) ant not any of them has lasted more than 2 yrs."
2,It's a Wash,"I'd really like it if I could use this without the ""Check Tank"" light coming on, then having to disassemble, reassemble, fill, empty, fill with salt water, shake, empty, clean, check online for tips, try those tips, prime the pump, call service, get same tips, and finally, most of the time, something works and voila! It cleans the floor. Of course, I've wasted 2+ hours of my life trying to get it to work, and the next time I want to use it, can expect more of the same!The Check Tank light is a catch-all warning of all things that could be wrong, from rollers, to clogs, to who-knows-what. I replaced my cleaning time with learning the ins and outs of Scooba troubleshooting, maintenance and light repair.I'd rather mop the darn floor."
5,Works great! Couldn't do without it now!,"I bought this Remanufactured iRobot Scooba Floor Washing Machine in September. It works great. I use it every Saturday. I wouldn't want to be without it now!I had a problem with the ""Release to Open"" Lever (to get to the clean and dirty tanks. This was within the Manufacturers 90 day warranty. They fixed the release; no problems with the iRobot company. I would recommend Amazon's 2 year warranty for this item, which I did buy.The Scooba does not clean the corners well. This is not a problem if you know about it; you just go around with a mop and clean the corners, and zap the house is clean.I like the way the Scooba scrubs and then squeegees the floor. There's no ""mop marks"".My husband was annoyed when I insisted on ordering this. After the first use, he was pleasantly surprised. He's bragged to his family about how great it works.Again, I wouldn't want to be without this machine."
4,Scooba to the rescue,Had to prime innitially to get it to work. Does a very good job on Linoleum. Does not do the edges very well.
3,.....,"I hate to mop, and this does a decent job...if it isn't broke, and after it's completely charged, and after you block off doors, move furniture, fill take a couple of times, and spend forever cleaning it afterwards. Oh Yeah, it's also loud and time consuming. But if mine didn't break every other time It was used, I would use it times a week. I could leave the house and come back to clean floors, no one to walk on them while wet, no missed spots etc."
3,"Scooba works well, but...","Overall, I'm happy with the product. However, here are two issues to consider:1. There is a valve that transfers the cleaning solution to the ""sprayer""...which seems to get clogged each time. iRobot provides a syringe to clear the valve (looks like a rubber bulb syringe used for clearing a baby's stuffed-up nose) and it seems to do the trick. However, it took about an hour of frustration to figure this out.2. The Clorox cleaning solution is impossible to find. I've checked Target, Best Buy, Safeway, you name it! I've also ordered it from both Amazon and iRobot sites and received a ~5 week backorder notice and have yet to get my order. Bottom line, if you're lucky enough to find the solution, stock up!"
5,Scooba review,We have both the Roomba and Scooba and are more than satisfied with both. What time savers they are and they clean very well.
1,Don't Bother,"The product performance is marginal, at best. The big issue is a new $70 battery every 7 - 8 months, around 30 cleaning cycles. One more battery and we will have bought a new Scooba.Bring in a commercial firm every 3 months and you will save money."
3,Scooba 5800,"Battery is what I concern most. It can only run around 30 minutes after fully charge. It has better to have ""scheduler"" and ""home base"" options in next generation"
1,Used it once and had to send it back,"I charged the Scooba per manual instructions and put it use on 1 floor. When it finished the battery needed to be charged again and when I tried to charge it I got the message that it could not charge the battery. I called IRobot support and they said to send the unit back in and it would be replaced under the warranty. I sent it in almost 2 weeks ago, but haven't heard from them since."
1,Disappointed,"This one is not as good as I thought. It leaves a wet trail, I have to go behind it and dry the floor, and it gets stuck easily, so I have to baby sit and make sure is doing its job. I will actually like to return it."
1,"1 good wash, 2 fair, 1 awful = $100 per use","It seemed like a good idea. It wasn't. It cleaned the floor well just once. The next time, it didn't cover much square footage, but kept going over the same floor and left water. The third time, it left more water. The fourth time, it left all its water.Even in the one good washing, it left the edges and corners dirty."
1,?? Novelty Item ??,Bought two years ago 8/06. Replaced six monhs later (warrenty) new battery a year ago.New charger 6 months ago.Stop working all togetherjuly of 08. Only repair available is replacementiRobot 5800 Scooba Floor-Washing Robot
1,"Nice concept, terrible execution","I love my roomba, so I added a scooba. This product mopped well enough, but was a pain to operate, clean out, and the water holder always smelled. Then after 3 months of use, it just stopped. I did lots of troubleshooting, and when I contacted iRobot-they informed the product has NO WARRANTY and they offer NO SERVICE or REPAIR. So, I now had a $249 piece of garbage. Do not buy this product. Very disappointed."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!,"My scooba is sending a ""charger has failed"" message. I called iRobot and I was told the entire unit needs to be replaced. I bought the scooba less than 1-1/2 years ago and used it maybe 10 times. They told me they'll sell me another scooba for $374.99, as I am out of warranty. Please be very careful about purchasing iRobot. Be prepared to dole out $300 to $500 every 1-1/2 years, as it seems that is the life span. Me? I would never buy another. It's not worth one star. Hope this helps anyone considering a purchase."
3,Opening and Batteries,"The battery life is inadequate and opening the unit is counter intuitive. My wife had lots of problems opening the unit because you push the handle down to lift it up. It's a really stupid design on the handle. It works once you understand it, but there's no instructions on how it works."
1,List Price is Wrong! Should be 100 less,"This Amazon listing is the Scooba 5800, the lowest cost Scooba, which lists for 299 not 399. The 399 is Amazon's ""list price"" as I post thisSee the manufacturer's website for the correct list prices. The better model 350 lists for 399 on the manufacturer's website (model numbers don't make sense because the 350 and 380 are better than the 5800 and the 380 is better than the 350). The differences are how many square feet they can do and included accessories."
2,Not that good.,"I love my roomba, but my scooba didn't make the cut. I doesn't mop that well, but that isn't so bad because I don't mop well either. But it is incredibly loud, and it gets stuck every 5 feet. One of those wouldn't be too bad, but together it was terrible. If it was just loud, then I'd leave the house while it ran. But no, it gets jammed under the dishwasher somehow, it his the virtual wall thing and then gets stuck on the carpet, it gets stuck when it comes to the stairs (roomba doesn't), it gets stuck for no good reason. So I have to walk across the wet floor and fix it. But, it's so loud that it's no fun to read a book or watch TV next to it. Mopping is easier.Someday iRobot will make a robot that mops as good as it vacuums. That day is not today."
1,Lasted 5 months only,"I purchased the Scooba despite the many bad reviews on amazon because I had a roomba and was happy with it.The Scooba never worked very well - it would randomly skip parts of the room (and it's very obvious when all the room is wet except a part), and it wouldn't do a very good job close to the walls. In the area it actually cleaned, it would deposit a lot of water and it would take a while to dry. Also, cleaning it after every use is a bit of a chore, and I'm not sure it saves you that much time.But were it only for these problems, I would rate it 2 or 3 stars - you don't expect this things to be perfect, and it did after all save me from some mopping for a while.The product drops to one star because it did not last more than 5 months. One day, out of the blue, it just stopped putting down water. I tried many advice found on the internet, but none worked.Buy at your own risk!"
5,Love the Scooba,"I'm really pleased with the Scooba. It cleans while I do other stuff. It does a job I'm way too lazy to do on a frequent basis. My floors are getting cleaned once a week instead of once in a blue moon. I'm satisfied with the level of cleaning and I like the mild, fresh scent of the Clorox cleaning solution. I'm a happy customer and recommend this to other people who have acres of hard surface flooring and don't like to mop.(Just wish I could give the little guy a dog treat or something for doing such a great job...)"
5,Works Great,Does exactly what it is intended to do.My kitchen floor (linoleum) and entryway (tile) haven't looked so clean since I bought the house new.With 9 grand kids I was tired of mopping the kitchen floor everytime they left. Now I don't have to. I simply turn it on and walk away. :)I have owned this bot for several months now and it has always worked flawlessly. The bot has even scrubbed up the dark stains in the linoleum that had accumulated even though I previously mopped quite frequently.The Scooba has worked so well I invested in a Roomba with which I am also quite pleased. Wife was a severe skeptic but has now been thoroughly convinced of the value.Welcome to the 21st century. :o)
3,Good once you get it working,"I really like the Irobot Scooba but it took me several times to get it to work properly. I almost returned it, thinking it was broken when I first got it. I ended up going online to the Irobot site to get instructions on troubleshooting. I have to ""prime"" my Scooba before it works properly (it's no big deal once I learned it). It cleans great and dries very quickly. I haven't pulled out my mop since I got it. It's alittle loud if you're trying to watch TV or have a conversation in the same room but not too bad. I would recommend it to friends."
4,Gotta Love it!,"I wanted this initially just to be able to say there was a robot doing my kitchen floors. Seriously, I am very impressed. I rated it 4 stars because the machine can't do corners (it's round) and it didn't get quite as close to the cabinet edges as I would have liked. I had a little trouble with start-up, had to prime the pump - but once it got going it was wonderful. I think if one did a good cleaning on the floors and then used this machine for daily or weekly maintenance, it is ideal. I hadn't mopped in a while, so this thing had its work cut out for it. Afterward, I took a white flour sack dishtowel, got it wet, then wiped a couple of areas to check and the towel came up clean - so Scooba did the job. The machine was easy to clean, and all the parts came off and went back on as promised. I was amazed and a little ashamed at the gunk it got up.Just ordered the Roomba Discovery, we'll see how that goes."
2,It's ok when it works,"This is my 3rd Scooba... when will I ever learn!! The concept is great... and when it works... it can do a pretty good job.... but... you never know when it is going to ""act up"" and either not work at all or stop several times during a cleaning cycle. I keep hoping they will work the bugs out... but so far... no such luck."
1,Product Won't Hold Up,"I bought this product 14 months ago. While it was working, I was not impressed: it's loud, doesn't get in corners, cleaning pattern doesn't make sense. After about 4-5 months the battery quit and the company sent me another one at no charge. However, now it's 2 months after the warranty expired, and the motor has died. The company offered to send me one at discounted price, but at roughly $300 a year, I said no thanks. I have no use now for the case of cleaning solution that I bought. I went to a steamer mop which works better in every way. Scooba is a good idea but it's still in the beta phase. Don't waste your money on this expensive, sub-quality product."
4,Gets your floors 90% clean,"If you are lazy and don't like hand scrubbing your floors on a regular basis, the Scooba does a great job getting your floors 90% of the way clean. No, it doesn't do a perfect job, but they certainly look a lot better than doing nothing or using a Swiffer (Dry or Wet).My husband was very skeptical about this purchase, but he's seen the light. It's very convenient to use. If you go a while between uses, have a turkey baster or a sports bottle handy to squeeze the excess air out of the tubes. It can be a little finnicky, hence the 4-star review.However, overall we're quite pleased with the purchase and our white linoleum floors look much better than they normally do!"
4,This thing is amazing,"I bought a refurbished model. The latch broke the first time I used it resulting in a perpetual ""check tank"" message. I remedied it by putting a rock over the latch portion. Also, the battery only lasts 15 to 20 mins rather than the 45 mins advertised. But if you have patience, it does cleans the floors!"
4,scooba review,"I already had a Scooba that I liked, and I bought a refurbished one on-line to have as an extra, as somtimes I want to clean more than the Scooba could do on one charge on Saturday mornings. The refurbished Scooba did not work properly when it arrived. I called iRobot and they sent me a replacement minus the charger and battery which I used from the defective one. I did not have to go to the trouble of mailing back the defective Scooba."
4,"Does the basic work, cleanup is tedious","We have had the Scooba for 6 months now. It works pretty well. I cannot complain about its ability to wash the floor, however you must remove any obstacles (chairs, carpets etc) to reduce the interference. The only complaint that we have had is that it does require a good amount of cleanup after each use. I do like that you can use vinegar in place of the clorox, so we use that once a month. We run our irobot vacuum first (kitchen and digning room are ceramic tile). ONce done, we run the scooba, then go to bed. I would say this has been effective and only twiced did it not complete the job because it got stuck.ONe bit of advice for anyone that is purchasing this for the first time, DO NOT WATCH IT WORK. It is frustrating watching the pattern it takes.Overall I think it really works, and helps with weekly moppings!"
4,"love it, I HATE to clean the floor","Vacuuming doesnt bother me, but mopping/cleaning my kitchen floor(hardwood) rarely happens (sad but true, and I have 3 small kids) so this is great for me. I use vinegar and it gets the job done in 45min. I have tried hoover floormate, and a steamer, and they always just sat in my closet(am I lazy? yes)only used a couple of times so i cannot speak to longevity, but so far so good, I recommend it."
4,good maintainer,"This is not a replacement for a good scrubbing of a floor, but for weekly maintance it is a great robot. It cleans the floor fairly well and is easy to setup and run, be careful of it stopping behind your door to your bathroom though. It also leaves the floor a little wet, but dries quickly."
1,not happy,purchased this as a gift for my daughter for chrismas. They can not get the thing to work. they have followed all the directions and it still does not work. not happy with this product at all. over prices for something that does not work.
1,I couldn't get it to work,"I simply could not get this product to work. After an hour of it constantly telling me the tank was in trouble, and disassembling and reassembling the unit, I would up throwing it in the trash. Maybe if you get one that actually works, it's good.I do love the new Roomba vacuum, so ymmv."
1,Doesn't Work.,"I just returned this to Amazon. My husband and I tried to get it to work right. It worked once. The second time, the light came on and it never worked after that. Definitely not worth $200.00. (what we paid after promotions)."
2,not worth the money,"I bought this at the same time I bought the Roomba. While it works better than the Roomba (which I gave 1 star), it still has too many problems. I think the main reason people buy the Roomba and Scooba is to cater to their laziness and/or lack of time. (For me, both!) Unfortunately, by the time you charge the Scooba, clean it, fill it with this many parts solution and that many parts water, lock it into place, (etc., etc.), you could have mopped the floor yourself and still had time to prepare a 5 course meal. Way too complicated and doesn't clean well enough to make it worth the effort."
1,INFERIOR product!!!!!!!!,"I bought one for myself & one for my daughter!What a disgrace...never seen such junk.\Paid full price for NEW but got REFURBISHED....Warranty not valid; they belnged to other people before we got fleeced!!!!If AMAZON doesn`t protect us from such FRAUD, I will not shopthere again---iRobot 330 Scooba Floor-Washing RobotThat was a lot of money !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Don`t waste your time nor money----------it`s junk!!!!Suzanne"
1,pergo floors!!,"Has anyone used scooba on pergo flooring? my flooring leaves wet marks with a mop.i would love to buy a scooba,im not sure if i should."
4,Roomba and Scooba--what a team,"Yes, I'm lazy. I hate washing the floors. I hate the look on my husbands face when I ask him to wash the floors. So Scooba is perfect for us. Ours didn't include instructions on how to prep it so my husband took a guess and it worked straight away. Cleaned my tile floors nicely. Not great on a charge but just put up the virtual wall and do one room at a time. Even with continuous recharging, it's still easier than doing it yourself. Thanks irobot!"
3,Just okay,"My husband bought me Roomba and Scooba for Christmas this past year. At first, they were both amusing and amazing. We have stopped using Roomba. We have all hardwood floors with tile in the bathrooms. Roomba has seriously damaged our wood floors. I think that it gets something stuck on the rubber wheels and drags it along. Scooba is nice, but the floors are no where near dry when it's done. It's good for laziness, which I am, but I think for now I'll just stick with my regular cleaning routine."
2,An unnecessary gadget,"This doesn't really save you much time with mopping, because you still need to go back after the Scooba is done and wipe up the excess water. If you leave the house with the Scooba running, you will come back to a dry floor with water spots all over the place.For me, the hard part about mopping is all the other steps involved in the process: moving furniture, sweeping, drying. The Scooba only eliminates one step - the actual mopping. But you still need to fill the Scooba, set it up, and clean it. It's more work than just doing the dang mopping yourself.Bottom line: if you're looking to save time with this gadget, you won't. Don't waste your money. Way overpriced."
2,"Love iRobot Discovery, but not impressed by Scooba","I have owned an iRobot Discovery vacuum clean for years, almost since it was released. I am pretty happy with it so when iRobot released Scooba I decided to go for it. Unfortunately Scooba has been a disappointment. I find that the area it is able to clean on a tank is far too limited. I am also unimpressed with the quality of cleaning, especially when it comes to corners or any area that is not wide open. At the end of the day I found myself going back to manual cleaning. I am a great fan of robots in any form and of automated anything in general (I am a 30 something computer engineer, which probably explains it). However I still expect the machine I buy/use to do a good job. Scooba is sadly not one of those."
2,Over Priced and Doesn't Work,"We bought our Scooba last year. Right off the bat, we had the problems that most do... getting it to work. We got it to do that after pushing down the spring and priming it.We were in ahh of the thing for about a month or two. Then it stopped working. We completely cleaned it, primed and it still didn't work. Finally, we got it to work, by starting and then letting the top tank to drop. This worked for awhile, until finally, it just won't even turn on. So now it sits in my living room do much of nothing.Two other complaints... if even a little bit of water is left in tank, during your next wash it smells moldy. Also, finding the specific cleaner is impossible to find. Thus, you are forced to use other detergents (maybe why ours doesn't work)."
1,Another broken robot.,"In the last 3 years through a variety of gifts, we've owntwo roomba's and a scoomba. NONE of them have lasted morethan six months. We have a clean apartment with hardwood floors.No dogs, no loose cables, no kids. Simply bad design and poor qualityhas caused them to fail.DO NOT BUY them!"
1,Poor quality product; don't bother !,"I have just put my scooba in the trash after two frustrating years. My usage was light - 3 cycles per week. It continually refused to work, and failed completely on twice within the warranty period. iRobot agreed to replace parts (in both cases pretty much a re-build)twice - but both times I had to pay for the shipping. It has now completely given up on me. Don't bother with this one. It is badly engineered seems to have major quality problems."
3,good product but too costly,"This product does a nice job but it's finicky.Pros: good battery life (when it charges), cleans floor well, does good job on my tile floorsCons: it's finicky. Sometimes does not fully charge, also tank needs to be primed if not used often and that's a pain. It's also slippery when wet. (which it will be after use) It flew out of my hands, hit my leg, and made a big gash in my leg.I paid $75 for this at Target on a markdown. If I had paid over $100, I would be upset with the product."
1,"Turkey Baster Needed?? DIdn't work, tech sup not helpful -","Bad experience. The unit would not dispense washing fluid. Called Tech support. Tech Support is not open past 5 PM on west coast. Called on weekend. Tech support said I needed to clean the unit using a TURKEY BASTER to blow out a one way valve. I do not have turkey baster. I wanted a replacement from IRobot, but would have to pay shipping costs myself. I tried to get a GMA from IROBOT - No luck. Irobot email would not work as they wanted. Returned back to Amazon. (Amazon does fine.) Irobot now has sent me a non requested replacement without battery & charger. Now trying to contact Irobot to return, but the tech support group is not open on weekends. -- I can understand a quality problem occasionally, but their support and NEEDING A TURKEY BASTER TO FIX A VACUUM IS COMICALLY ABSURD."
1,Do not buy it! Does no work!,"This series has a problem! DO not buy it! Choose another series than Scooba 330.I was talking to a salesman from a big store and he told me they had the same problem with almost all this model. They had it all returned.Here is what happened:I bought this product for my kitchen floor. At first I noticed it did no clean that spots hard to clean on the floor ( I had to use the broom) .But anyway, as I have pets and kids at home, I thought it was a little help.For my disappointment it stopped working after 4 weeks I had oppened the package!"
5,Amazing,"I saw them at Fitzgerald's, a local club, and they blew me away. Mix punk,hardcore,and metal. Add a tiny bit of emocore(very small, but you can hear it in some breakdowns and stuff). If Dead Kennedys played metal and toured with Hot Water Music. Good stuf"
1,Not great.,"Blades were not sharp enough for my needs. Had a hard time cutting foamcore with them. Basically, the package I have is worthless to me."
1,dull blades,Blades were dull. This has been happening lately since exacto blades are now produced in china. Will have to switch to excel or olfa blades.
2,Do not buy this product,Do not buy this product. quality of this product is not good it is better to spend more for quality product.
1,Don't waste your money...,"The supposedly superior ""blue blades"" are beyond bad. The tips break easily, and if you are doing fine detail cutting, that is unacceptable. I use a self-healing mat, like a previous reviewer, and am also a 25-year design veteran who has used #11 X-Acto blades since I was a kid. I know exactly how long they should last and exactly how they should perform. If you look at FRESH blades out of the package under a magnifying lupe, you can see that many of the ""new"" blades have rounded, dull tips, some are broken and some are even bent! At least 50% of my 100-pack was pre-dull--and by that, I mean the tips were worn rounded, almost as if they were sharpened that way or even recycled. Completely unacceptable.If you want the original, high quality #11 blade from X-Acto (100-count), you have to be sure to order X811 and neither X511 or X611. The originals are FAR better to work with, and you can at least count on the fact that they will be sharp right out of the box."
3,"Not what I ordered, but I'll take them.","I ordered Xacto blades no. X611 in a plastic dispenser box - as shown on the Amazon site when I ordered.I received Xacto blades X811 in a paper box. I emailed the seller.The answer ""Catchpenny gave was -''If you return to the main page you can read it for yourself. We understand that this is easy to miss. Amazon does not represent this information in a way that buyers will readily see it before purchase. We have no control over how the information is presented and do the best that we can.As we wrote in the description the main photo that is displayed for this item is incorrect. Amazon will not change the photo or allow us to change it yet. ""I could not find this information as written above on the Amazon site.So buy these if you think that they'll work for you. Me, I like to get what I ordered. I'll see later if they keep their point."
1,THESE SUCK,I hate these blades. I ordered them and I was very happy when I got them quickly. I was soon very disappointed when I opened the package and EVERY SINGLE BLADE WAS DULL. These suck. Not only did I really need them for a project but they just aren't worth the money!!! I am never buying x-acto blades ever again. Don't waste your time with these.
1,Useless,The reason I bought these blades is the super fine pointed tip in quality blades make them perfect for splinter removal and other delicate tasks.These blades have a poorly made blade-tip that has no actual point. I took several out at different places in the pack and they were all similarly rounded. Yes the blade is sharp....but without a useable tip they are just expensive garbage in terms of my needs. Very very disappointing - I would not recommend these to anybody.
2,blue exacto blades,I was disappointed that the blades were blue. I wanted the silver ones. They are much sharper and work better.
4,Read Carefully,"When I made my purchase, the pricing at the distributor's website was misleading. Later, after discussing this mater with their customer service, the website was changed for clarification."
5,Best Brush Ever,The only brush you'll need. Mine has lasted me over 10 years now and is going strong.
3,"Good, but...","This is a CD that has grown on me...but I have to admit that when I first got it (based on recommendations here) I couldn't help but wonder if Ralph was on amphetamines (Sorry Ralph!). He sings some of these songs so FAST. Having said this, I do like it's upbeat nature, provided I'm not needing my children to go to sleep anytime in the near future. My kids are only 2 1/2 years and 9 months, so maybe when they're a little older we'll appreciate this more."
2,Pardon me?,"I am, quite honestly, astounded by the preponderance of positive reviews for this CD. Having worked at a shop which appeals primarily to children, this CD is played over our speakers all the time.I can safely say that if you listen to this CD enough times, you will eventually choose to eat your children rather than continue to endure Ralph's inanities.Go ahead. Try it out. You'll see."
4,"Fun for parents, aunts, uncles...","This CD offers a few recognizable songs and lots of new material. The songs are catchy, most you can sing along with, and some even give kids the chance to add their own words. Now if only I could get ""Freddy Bear..."" out of my head!"
5,Detailed listing of all known OREGON Trade Tokens,"A complete listing of all known Oregon TRADE TOKENS, ""Good-For"" tokens, arranged by city and merchant, with full descriptions of obverse and reverse, a rarity guide, some pictures, and a comprehensive index by all words on all tokens. IN PRINT, and available from stock, in softbound or hardbound. I am the publisher."
2,jump rope,was hoping the ropes would be better. We use them 4 days a week and the handle of one has already come off. Not horrible but not what we needed.
3,A basic device,"This is the first non-contact thermometer, but not sure if it worked correctly. When 'shooting' the surface of boiling water I constantly got less that 200 degrees F. That's why I gave it 3 stars."
5,Surface temperature tool,"This really should be classified as a kitchen tool and is used to measure surface temperature on frying pans, warm and cool areas on a wall, etc.. The tool is excellent, easy to use and reliable and apparently accurate."
5,MicroTemp MT-PRO Digital Infrared Thermometer,"Excellent product at an excellent price. Very handy for HVAC work and auto and motorcycle diagnostics. I use it mainly for tuning motorcycles for high performance and competition use. Works for cylinder head temps, exhaust header temps, oil cooler and radiator temps. Even general use for tire temps."
1,Why does Amazon think this is a toy?,"This is a reasonable measurement tool. However, you need to ensure it is accurate enough for your needs. Initial accuracy is 4F (about 2C). But when the meter gets cold, the meter reads a much lower and more inaccurate temperature. Therefore, you need to keep the meter in room temperatures, and if you need to make a reading in a cold ambient temperature, do so quickly.The meter is easy to operate and read and seems quite robust; I have dropped one onto concrete and it survived.The odd thing is Amazon asked me how to rate this toy when I wrote this review!"
1,A word of warning,"If you record your own music using a Roland CDX-1 Disclab. These CDs simply will not work. When you put the CD into the Disclab, the LCD screen will say 'Reading media' for almost 5 minutes. If you are patient enough, you will finally see a message that says 'Media Error'. If you have a Roland CDX-1 Disclab, use the TDK High Speed discs."
3,"Interesting gossip, flawed research","This is an excellent summary of the present state of European royals at the beginning of the 3rd millenium. Its nice to have information on which Hapsburg has married which Oldenburg and what the present state of the monarchist cause is in various countries in Eastern Europe. Historically the book is somewhat flawed by some sloppy research and/or editing. For example, the chapter on the Belgian Royal Family is fraught with errors. King Albert I is referred to as Alfred at one point, and there are numerous genealogical mistakes (Albert I was nephew, not son, of Leopold II). I don't regret buying the book for its information on present day royals, but I would not rely on it for research on their predecessors."
1,MAMMA MIA THAT'S A SOME AWFUL MOVIE,"MOTHER'S DAY MASSACRE doesn't take place on Mother's Day---and that's not the only thing that doesn't make sense.e.g. The gynecologist in the opening scene later turns up as a perverted hypnotherapist.e.g. What does the snuff film have to do with anything?e.g. Why would anyone put up the $500 budget for a mess like this?As usual, the world's oldest teenagers are typically obnoxious and unsympathetic.The attempts at humor include the reference to Michael Myers' hometown of Haddonfield even though this howler is supposedly set in the South but filmed in New Joisey. Add the cookie making sequence and the killer's huge boner to the list of flaccid failures (pun intended). I guiltily admit I enjoy a cheesy movie but not when they're this moldy!"
1,One Of The Worst Movies With 'Massacre' In The Title,"There have been many horror movies with ""massacre"" in the title. My favorites are The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Remake), and Slumber Party Massacre 2 (!). However, I won't be adding Mother's Day Massacre to that list.There is only one bright spot in Mother's Day Massacre, and it has nothing to do with a massacre. It has to do with Greg Travis, who plays a profanity spewing redneck who gets all of the films best lines. Other than him, it's mostly a badly scripted, badly directed low-budget gore-comedy with not enough gore and even less comedy.Watch Mother's Day or Texas Chainsaw Massacre again, or for the first time. Those are obviously the movies this wants one wants to be like...and fails at."
1,"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL","ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER. IT WAS SICK, STUPID, WEIRD, PERVERTED AND YOU NAME IT. IT IS SO AWFUL I AM MAD AT MYSELF FOR WASTING THE TIME TO WATCH THIS TRASH!!!!! I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GIVE IT A STAR, BUT IF I MUST I WILL. I CAN'T SAY IT ENOUGH HOW BAD THIS IS."
5,Even nicer than the picture--,"I received my ordered item on time, despite the record-setting blizzard in NYC the weekend after I ordered it.My Tinkerbell watch exceeded my expectations-- it's even nicer than the picture, and in perfect, mint condition. The stars on the rotating inner dial acting as the ""seconds"" hand makes it even sweeter to look at.My Tink watch was also packaged beautifully-- if it had been a gift, all I'd've had to do was stick a bow on it.Thank you-- it was a real pleasure doing business. If I ever need to get a gift watch for someone, this is where I'll go."
5,A passionate performance of a great and dark masterwork,"Not many music lovers will be acquainted with the works of Florent Schmitt.His music is, despite his German sounding name, typical French. A mixture of Fauré, Franck and Debussy.The piano-quintet is one of his masterpieces. I heard it at a live-performance in the 'orangerie' of a well-known 'Hortus Botanicus' in summer (in the Netherlands). It was for me totally unknown music but it made a deep impression.This recording does all expectations come true: it is a passionate performance of highly concentrated music. Werner Bartschi is a brilliant pianist, in the sense of technique as well as sensitivity for ensemble-playing. This is the way French chambermusic of the beginning of the twentieth century should be played.I can't make a comparison with the (scarce) other performances, but this one is very satisfying and inspiring. You can't come free after beginning listening!"
4,Great for Kids 6 and under,"The meld of French and English goes so well that it is easy to follow. After listening to it several times, understanding of exactly what the French words are comes alive. It is a wonderful book to reinforce early language skills."
5,Big success for new grandson,"I purchased this video as a Christmas present for my new grandson who was only 2 months old at Christmas. My daughter played the video for my grandson during those early months. She told me that he loved it. I didn't really believe that such a young child could enjoy anything as much as she said. Last week we had the opportunity to spend a week's vacation with them. EVERY time that they put this video on, he started kicking his feet, twisting in our arms, straining to turn his head if he was facing the other direction, etc. He is now 7 months old and seems to love the video even more. I don't know why he likes it so much. It may be because the music is upbeat and the objects are large and colorful. Whatever the reason, he loves this video! We felt a little foolish playing Christmas songs in May but it was worth seeing his excited gestures, the sparkle in his eyes, etc. I recommend this video to anyone who has young children and who likes Christmas music all year long!"
3,Not that great,"This monitor showed up in my ""Gold Box"" so I took a chance on it. I wound up returning it because the picture quality was just not that great. It wasn't very clear, particularly on photographs and other images that require a lot of pixels. I tried to find a better driver to improve it but like other reviewers couldn't find a web site. So I decided to send it back and find another brand that was better. So I guess I'd say if you don't need a lot of detail in a monitor this might be an economical choice but otherwise you should probably look elswhere."
2,Very indepth and realistic. Scary for young children.,"My terminally ill daughter had been to many hospital visits and surgeries when I bought this book for her at four after reading the age range and Editor's Reviews above. She didn't like the real photos of children with tubes and wires in them. It may not be a good choice for children under 7, even if you want to introduce a little reality into the situation. The black and white photos can be bleak and depressing also. It desperately needs new photos!For older children, it covers everything! Every procedure and machine. But it's kind of like reading a medical dictonary, and seeing all the horrible things that can go wrong, when you just want to see how the heart works."
3,The Exchange - 'no backs',"A very quick read. The style may be old-hat to some of you, but to this reader, it wasn't. Lots of suspense and easy-to-imagine scenery.I found myself pausing often trying to figure out who was telling the truth and who was not. I had high hopes for the ending and was truly surprised by it.I found this suspense novel entertaining and the graphic descriptions in keeping with the story line."
1,Very Poor,"I agree with the sentiment expressed in most of the other customer reviews. This book is very poorly organized, and the material is not well presented. Although there is some useful information in this book, good prior knowledge of COM and MFC are necessary to take advantage of it. The apparent lack of editing of this book would make me think twice about purchasing another technical book from this publisher."
4,Well Done,"Saw this video several years ago. I believe it is a 1964 performance on a British TV show with a live audience, that provides about 45 minutes to an hour of straight Beatles, including some songs never recorded like ""Jump"". They perform most of their hits recorded up to that point in time."
5,Anne Frank the Diary of a Young Girl,"I rated this book a five because while you read it makes you relize that you are so lucky you weren't born in those very tragic times.It made me think about how easy I, and others have it.I love this book because it teaches me about other peoples lives and how hard it was for them.I also think that it was well written and easy to understand.I'm not positive that you will like this book because of how sad and frightning the tale is, but if you are anything like me you will have your face stuck in a book 'till your done."
4,What I thought...,"This book was a great book! One of my favorits. It does not only tell you what happened but you can see pictures on almost every page of what was goin on. This can help you if you get lost in whats really going on. This book is a very descriptive book. It told you what Anne felt about wearing a yellow star, going into hidding from Hitlar, and not being able to go outside and play. It also tells about the death camps, and concentration camps. Go get this book it was a very well written book!"
5,Anne Frank: Beyond the Diary : A Photographic Remembrance b,Anne Frank is a name that has become synonymous with the evils of Nazi Germany and their terrible and vile treatment of the Jews. It is quite painful to look at the photographs and see the evil that was done not all that long ago at all. The picture of a smiling Anne Frank on the cover is a shilling reminder that she was oblivious to the horrible future that lay ahead of her and her family. It is very tasking to think that the incident occurred just 30 years prior to my birth and it is now still only less then 100 years since this insidious incident happened.
4,Couldn't put it down,"Many may think they know about Anne Frank, but really will not learn it all without reading this enticing book, and the photos just add to the experience."
1,Beware! NOT the original renditions,"These are remakes. Just be aware if you're looking for the original recordings, these are not what you want. You'll be disappointed at the 'new' sound.The older originals for some of these are, for some reason, very hard to get and at outrageous prices by private sellers."
4,minor detail,"I am only giving this 4 stars because the wooden handle came off the metal piece but this is still a VERY GOOD chaun, just get some epoxy and fix it, it's not surprising after time the glue they used just became weak or they used a cheap glue, this doesn't intimidate me, it's a $4 chaun, so for the amount I am thrilled and it is just a minor detail, the people who get upset about it are just wasting energy getting mad, this is a fixable thing and it's a great chaun for the price :D thanks wok shop"
5,Awesome,"This is a hand made item, with decent quality. Where can you get cheap handmade cooking tools!! Pound the handle in well with a hammer and seal the wood, ready to go."
1,not so good,"Handle fell off after a week 1/2 - 2 weeks. so true u get what u pay for, i don't blame them, there's only so much u can do for 4.95 and thats what amazon sells it for, so for the mfg its cheaper."
1,Very Bad Design,I also found this to be a horrible product. The handle was totally wobbly and almost impossible to use. I would return it if it wasn't even work the return shipping. They literally just shoved the wood part in the end and hoped for the best.
1,Do not buy this product!,It's a pooper scooper. A heavy piece of metal made in China that does not look like it should be used in the kitchen. The seller charged me $85 for two day shipping...a complete rip off.
4,Just got it... looks good,"Gotta admit that I was a bit thrown off that the wood part of the handles (bought 2 spatulas) were not attached the the metal part of the spatula. That was no problem... just line the wood handles in the holes of the spatulas... tap them in with a hammer, and your good.... really pretty easy. The handles are also raw (unstained/unsealed/untreated) wood. Just add a food-safe oil of some sort to the wood after each wash, to keep the handles from drying and spliting, and they should last quite a very long time.Over all... four stars... they could have put the handles, but no big deal."
2,Wood handle detaches from metal piece,Came apart in first day of usage. It's still a wobbly spatula after reattaching. Two stars because would be nice if it were put together better.
3,Not exactly the 'real' thing,"I was rather disappointed when it arrived. My family uses this kind of spatula (wok chuan) since my great grandma's generation and it last for generations! Firstly, the front part of the spatula was not as wide as I would have expected - we use this part to estimate the amount of oil we put into the wok. It also does not stir and flip as well. I cook almost everything with wok and wok chuan. After each cooking, I have to hammer the wooden attachment back as it gets loose and shaky towards the end of cooking. But overall, it still serves its purpose well - able to cook! Till I get one from Asia..."
1,Spatula,"Should have come in with the WOK, Ring and the spatula included as one set!Should have done better research on this item. Gone to a local store."
1,I guess I shouldn't be too surprised,"It was pretty inexpensive, but I was still surprised when I opened the box and the wooden portion of the handle wasn't attached to the metal portion--and when I shoved it into place, it just slipped back off. I would say that this 14"" spatula is a perfectly good 9.5"" spatula with a tendency to get a little warm in the hand--and that it comes with a small stick."
3,Okay Product,"It is not the best nor is it the worst. It works well; however, if you don't mind washing it by hand otherwise I find that the handle may come off in the dishwasher."
3,"Decent wok ""stick""","The wood handle has to be epoxied or pinned to the spatula. The wood handle came right off when I opened the package. I should have looked at the length of this unit before purchasing. I actually prefer them to be more like 10 inches or so. Also, the spatula head is not very angled off the handle. As a result the handle has to be held higher during cooking and the spatula head does not conform to a round wok bottom very well."
3,Caviat Emptor,There is a grammer problem. It is describedd as a 14 inch wok spatula. The spatula is over 16 inches long ncluding handle. It is fine for a 14 inch wok ut rather too large for anything smaller. The wodeden handlle came off immediatly and had to be re clued back in. . If you have a Joyce Chin wok its rather large to manipulate. The steel of the spad is heavy aand will be usable for a lifetime.K.J.Haldeman
1,Junk,"I give it one star because you can't give it zero. I've had it only a few weeks, used it maybe half a dozen times, and the wooden handle fell off. It's just a pressure fit, so there''s no nail or screw holding it on. I'll have to buy another one, which is my definition of why this was a waste of money."
1,Junk - poorly made...,"Spatula fell apart during first use of it.... Maybe some crazy glue will work. However, we were accidentally sent a second one for free."
2,What's wrong with the handle,"I bought this spatula along with a new wok for Christmas. And as soon as I took the spatula out of the package the wooden part of the handle started falling off. I tried to convince myself that it was part of the design for cleaning. So I pushed the wood back in and went on trying to convince myself. Then the first time it was used the wood part fell right out again. It can be pushed in, but clearly this will remain a problem. The spatula worked beautifully when cooking. It really provided a way to move everything around easily in a very full wok. I'd love to get a new one to replace this one, however the return shipping is just about the cost of the spatula so it isn't worth returning."
2,It just doesn't fit me,"Wooden part of the handle feels a bit too light and flimsy. Would have preferred if it had a metal rod center. Handle also seems a bit long for someone cooking standing by a waist high stove rather than squatting by a floor level one. It probably feels less awkward if you are a very very tall person.Basically I have not used it more than twice because it just was not comfortable. I am instead using a standard wooden spatula. Still this thing it not very expensive. So if you want to try it and see if it's a better fit for you, it's not like you are loosing much."
3,not the best,"to small,to much lack of detail,the online picture looks better. the only way to really have fun with this is to get the safari giant squid to go with it.by the way bad service from amazon."
4,Not for beginners,"Of course, you can not learn how to dance with this book.But I think it is a fun gift if you know somebody who is interested in belly dance and already knows some steps or movements.The gift is not the little book, but the finger cymbals and adhesive jewels included."
4,"Cheap finger cymbals, but they do the trick","I was looking for cheap finger cymbals for an introduction to belly dancing class I was taking. These cymbals are not the best quality, but they are perfect for a beginner. Or someone like me who wasn't sure if bellydancing would be something I would continue to do. I had horrible rhythm so I did not use the cymbals for very long after becoming frustrated. The little book is nice for a ""refresher"" on how to do movements you may have already learned in class or on a dvd."
1,Belly Dancer in a Box,"This is not a book. It is a box with a pamphlet inside. It has been referred to by dancers as ""Belly Dancer in a Box""."
1,Corrupt CD,"I had been looking for this recording for ages and was overjoyed to find it for sale here and, in spite of its vastly inflated price, was prepared to buy it. I was extremely disappointed to discover that the last two tracks were corrupt, with increasingly frequent, very high level digital pops and crackles as it got closer to the end of the CD. There are no visible marks or blemishes on the disc which was clean when it arrived. However, since it was sold as ""used"", I believe it unlikely that the seller didn't know it was corrupt."
3,liquid form easier to swallow,Liquid form easier to swallow. I have tried capsules they tend to get stuck in my throat. Difficulty swallowing. Liquid seems to inhibit inflamation. portion for price however is minimal. Wo't purchase again.
3,"Ojo! no trae camara, por lo demas esta bien.","Pro:El diseño es elegante, todas las funciones PDA normales, lee documentos de Office y PDF bastante bien. El browser de internet esta bien. El uso del jog dial y la pantalla tactil, permite manejarlo con una sola mano.La interconexion con la PC de escritorio es facil y puedes cargar tus fotos, videos y musica sin muchos problemas. El color y brillo de la pantalla es bueno.Contra:No trae camara, el inicio cuando se enciende es incomprensiblemente lento, iniciar el browser y otras funciones tarda demasiado, una vez iniciadas las funciones ya trabaja normal. Se reinicia de vez en cuando el solo. Si abres muchas funciones a la vez termina inhibiendose.En resumen el estilo y presentacion es muy buena, si nunca te ha servido la camara de un telefono movil (porque nunca las fotos salen con calidad aceptable) y tienes un poco de paciencia al encenderlo, pues..... compralo!"
4,What's not to like?,"This disc sounds as great as it did when I first purchased it back in the 70s. It was the first Butterfield album I had purchased since East/ West. Great band and vintage Butterfield on the harp. Love the standards, such as Walkin' Blues. All in all, this disc doesn't sound ""dated"" to me in any way."
3,A restful cassette,"All of the inspirational duets sung by Gordon MacRae and Jo Stafford are beautiful and restful; however, whoever transferred their singing from vinyl record to this cassette release, has Jo Stafford's voice too loud, making it harder to hear Gordon's fabulous harmony. The most noticeable to me were ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" and ""He"" which would sound more impressive if their voices had been more evenly balanced. Perhaps this cassette was meant to showcase Jo Stafford's voice. I'm not complaining; I enjoyed the uplifting music!!! For better, more balanced, renditions of these same songs (plus a whole lot more), I recommend the cd ""The Old Rugged Cross"" featuring Jo Stafford and Gordon MacRae."
2,"Interesting for some, useless for others","I have read several books pertaining to flatware, and many of them have a few strengths, and more weaknesses. This book does not break that trend.The best feature in this book is that the measurements of many flatware pieces are listed. The introductory section is also informative for those not familiar with flatware. Histories of today's manufacturers are also comprehensive.However, the book is so poorly organized that it makes for a difficult read, and very difficult to use as a reference book.Also, the photographs are so small, you will need a magnifying glass to distinguish between even barely similar patterns. There are much better books on silverware available."
4,Extremely useful cruising guide,"Nigel's guide is THE cruising guide for Cuba. It provides very detailed instructions for entering all minor and major anchorages, harbors, cities, etc. We used it on our two month westbound cruise of the north coast this year, and found it invaluable.The only complaint I have is that he hasn't updated it in many years. Things change constantly, in terms of check in procedures, and where you can or cannot anchor, etc. Otherwise, a fantastic guide!"
5,Ohgr is best thing to come out of Skinny Puppy,"I have to admit that I consider Ohgr to be the best set of work to come out of Skinny Puppy. While SP is very noisy experimental stuff, Ohgr is very polished and every song is good. I am really surprised that this stuff is not on the radio. I too saw Ohgr at the Palace in Hollywood (this is a small place, I guarantee you would not see Nine Inch Nails here, which is more what this album resembles--back in the pretty hate machine days). I don't understand why this band is not huge. I guess I have no idea what is popular and what is not anymore. Definitely the most accessible listening that Ogre (the man) has done. Do yourself a favor and buy this CD."
4,a great fresh idea from an industrial legend,"Wow! this cd is very different! i like that. fans of Skinny Puppy may or may not like this. there is no real classification of music to put this in to. every song is great except for a couple of them. my faves are tracks 1 and 8.at first listen i thought this album was ok, but upon repeated listens it really grew on me. i find that most cds that grow on me are the ones i like the most. the music is dark,not as much as Skinny Puppy's though. Ohgr's voice really carries the album. the beats are cool too. just a snippet of guitar here and there. just how i like it :) very smart lyrics as well,something you might expect from Ohgr. so,in closing go out and buy this cd! it's great. also, pick up his new album PsunnyPsyOp. it's just as good if not better! take care :)"
3,Not what you think it is...,"If you're expecting Ogre from Puppy, this aint what you get. Think combo of some Brit New Wave bands; especially check out Track 11 and think 1981 Duran Duran, all right. Ogre does early Le Bon better than Le Bon does.I was expecting the Bill Rieflin / O G R E project and Rieflin only works on like 2 tracks and never owns it.It's not entirely horrible for what it is...If this was the 80's Pop Ogilvie that the world missed - here's your chance."
5,Killer album,"Excellent industrial pop album, not quite like postal service... just better. I like sunnypsyop more but i guess its because i heard it first."
1,industrial disco sludge,"I generally enjoy bands that are considered industrial but this supposed industrial band sounds more like the brain child from a collaboration between Al Jorgenson (good) and the Bee Gees (bad). Whats even worse though is when you combine good and bad you should get neutral but this album is terrible excluding the decent first song water. Let's say you like goofy loopy drum beats while someone tries to sing either creepy or like a whiny little girl listening to stayin' alive, and then there's circus music thrown in for good measure, then this is the album for you. If you want some good industrial music thats a bit newer than Ministry or Nails (both excellent) try the Damage Manual or Pigface. thanks for your time."
4,"Eclectic Industrial is a good thing with ""Ohgr""","This is an awesome album from one of the most important forces behind industrial music. Nivek Ogre and Mark Walk really put together some very different, and very good, songs on Welt. From the just plain catchy ""Cracker"" to the FLA meets KMFDM sounding ""Pore"". Ohgr takes advantage of so many different musical genres and makes them work together. This album is just a must have for any fan of industrial music, and definately for any fan of Skinny Puppy. One of the most interesting and creative albums released in 2001 ... even though it was made in 95 ... ; )"
5,A Great New Direction!,"I was really excited to hear the new material from Ohgr and had been looking forward to this album for years! At first, I was kind of disappointed and wasn't sure just what the heck was going on, heh. I think many people will be shocked the first time they listen to this album. But after listening to the album 2 or 3 times, you slowly begin to realize just how *BRILLIANT* it is! The musical compositions are great, very detailed and complex and Ohgr's lyrics are just as strong as ever.I've been a Skinny Puppy fan for years, but this album does not sound like them at all... actually, it's really hard to describe the sound of this album, you can't quite put a label on it. Favorite tracks are: Pore, Cracker, Suhleep"
5,At long last,"A pleasure for any fan of Skinny Puppy or interesting music in general, the Nivek Ogre/Mark Walk collaboration finally sees the light of day. Thankfully, it was well worth the extended wait. In better days, songs like ""Cracker"" could actually be radio material. Buy it."
3,Can't be bad. It's Ogre. but...,"Being a long time Skinny Puppy fan makes this Easily one of the most anticipated releases for me... ever? Despite that, I can't claim the disk lives up to the expectations at all. Personally, I think Ogre's works with KMFDM and Rx are far superior. That is not to say this disk is bad, it is not. A lot of the songs are good compositions, but outside of most of Ogre's vocals, the CD sounds amateur. Even some of the vocals are unlistenable(""Sleep"" makes me claw at the walls). However, I find tracks like ""Water"" and ""Kettle"" to be so top notch that it is impossible to dismiss this CD outright. I would say it gets 6 out of 10..."
4,Disco Ogre,Yea.. it's about time this was released... Fun music ... lil cheesy at times . Surprisingly complex and cerebral at times. I'm going to see the OhGr show here in Pittsburgh next Weds. Hopefully he can do something special live as well . Will be interesting to see Cevin jamming out. Rumor is OhGr has been working on the follow-up cd to this one and it will be released this Fall or Winter . I bet that one will be more concise and unified. The song 'Devil ' i really like . 'Cracker ' is real catchy. I find myself singing it all day . 'Pore ' is rather maniacal to say the least ! BRAP ON !
3,not very well padded and not high quality,"I had to squeeze my keyboard into this bag that it was supposedly made to fit in, and then the threads seemed to be splitting at the edges. Fortunately I sold it. :)"
4,These are great!!!,I love the sign language cards they r great i have brought all of the sets.u just need to laminate the cards 1st.we carry them everywhere with us they are very good for plane rides etc
4,SIGNING IS GREAT,"I started signing with my 8-month-old son. He got it after a couple of months, and from that point on, life was much easier. Great for parents who want to communicate with an infant who is in turmoil out of frustration because you don't understand what they want or need."
3,"An important,incomplete explanation of psychiatry's flaws s","A Harvard psychiatry professor explains one key aspect of what is wrong with psychiatry - its fragmented method of patient care - and correctly calls for straightening the system out, but he wrongly both accepts the usefulness of the harmful drugs commonly used and sees answers to psychiatry's problems in the limited area of brain research in which he has been involved."
5,Love it!,"I have read and re-read this book since it frist came out and was relieved when I read The Han Solo Trilogy - Volume 3 : Rebel Dawn to see that A.C. Crispin had included references to the books and the fun and exciting adventures that were written. The characters were written just as I had immagined they would be, based on the movies. It should be included in any Star Wars novel collection."
4,Great price but one problem,Bought this brand new as a gift but some pages were folded in and therefore unevenly cut and didn't look nice. Otherwise would have given 5 stars.
4,"The first SW ""Prequel"" (well sort of...)","Twenty years before the release of the much-hyped first SW movie prequel, the late Brian Daley wrote this action-packed book trilogy chronicling some of Han and Chewie's adventures prior to the events of ""A New Hope."" Chock full of the action, suspense and technical wonder that is synonymous with SW, these novels go great when read along with A.C. Crispin's more recent ""Han Solo"" trilogy. They also introduce readers to new worlds and the third installment, ""Han Solo and the Lost Legacy,"" even develops Han's charater in a way reminiscent of another Lucas hero played by Harrison Ford, Indiana Jones."
3,Brian Daley's Han Solo trilogy,"The Han Solo trilogy was okay. Brian Daley was a great author. There is just two things missing from this trilogy:The Imperials just disapeared and they don't tell how Han got the Falcon. Otherwise,a great trilogy. Daley is one of the ""founding fathers"" of Star Wars,so he got it,unlike Neil Smith of the Lando Calrissian trilogy."
3,"ok, but only if this is the last book lying around","Han Solo, probably one of the most interesting characters in the Star Wars universe, as he's not as black or white as most characters. Unfortunately this book only gives us three stories with a rather two dimentional Han. The only reason I'm giving it three instead of two stars is because the fact that it's about Han Solo it builds up a certain anticipation, which it ulitmately doesn't live up to. If you want to read something about Han Solo, read A.C. Crispin's excellent trilogy. However if you've read all the better SW books out there and are now reading some of the back catalog of lesser ones (like me) it isn't truly bad, it's just that it could have been so much more"
3,A History Lesson,This book fills in some of the background for Han Solo (along with The Han Solo Trilogy). I would recommend these books for a Han Solo fan. Otherwise they do not really have that big a bearing on other books (altough there are a few passing remarks in other books that do pertain to these).
4,Some good background info for the fans,"Learn why Chewbaca and Han have such unconditional loyalty toward each other. Learn why Han doesn't want robots talking to him. Learn why he has that scar on his chin, and why his pants have piping on the side. Some good action, fun stuff!"
3,ok but not great,Bought 3 batteries - 2 have worked decent but 1 has held a charge less and less since first plugging it in.
2,okay,I was hoping this would have a little more to it. It has gorgeous pictures but it would have made a better calendar than a book. If you are looking just for pictures then this will be great.
3,Dated,"Collection of science fiction short stories. A bit tricky to assess at this point, while they contain a lot of neat ideas they're also ideas I've seen used a lot since, and in many cases a lot better. Blish is pretty good at executing a story and his prose is competent, but there's not enough humor, raw creativity or bite to his descriptions to make his short fiction stand the test of time like an Asimov or a Philip K. Dick. While I liked Blish's A Case of Conscience quite a deal, this particular anthology left me much colder, and is probably part of the reason I didn't get around to read it until four years after I bought this volume.Still, if I was reading this in 1959 I'm sure I would have had my mind blown several times, and none of the stories stand out as bad, or even boring. I was most found of Beep. Overall, I'd say this collection was worth the look.Similar to and better than: Fritz Leiber's Gather, Darkness!Similar to and worse than: Isaac Asimov's The Early Asimov"
5,"Lord, Where Are You When Bad Things Happen?",A wonderful study of the sovereignty of the Lord and how the study uses the book of Habakkuk to give us an example of how to trust in the Lord when we don't understand our circumstances or when bad things happen. God is there and He has a purpose for everything.
1,Can't review unt il readd,I n ever receivied this book and never heard from them via e-mail to them.Thank you.
4,"A Bit Dated, But Still Hits Target Audience","Got this for a friend based on a recommendation--it does what it claims to by helping walk through [married in particular] men from the closet to living an open life.It is written from a religious perspective, meant to help those who are gay believers. That, plus the fact it was written in 1997, means it isn't necessarily the best tool for those coming out, but with that context in mind--he does a good job with most advice still relevant today."
2,ninja spikes,does anyone else notice in that picture that all that guy has to do is bend and he gets poked by his own spike?
4,An Enjoyable Album,"Honestly, I am not a die hard Diana Ross fan, I have my favorites of hers, as a solo artist (Love 90% of the Supremes' catalog). After buying this album (Blue), I am happy I did. I love the standards and hearing a young Diana Ross give her stamp to these timeless treasures. I do believe that she does justice to them, but remember she was almost 30 years old when she cut this album, can you imagine if she had cut this album now with all of the life experiences she has had and of course with the feeling of her voice now!!!in my opinion, the only slacker on this disk is I Loves Ya Porgy...she seams strained and unprepared to tackle this one...sorry folks, not my favorite track on the disk. All in all, a good set of music that should have been released back in 1972, but nice it waited to get its full appreciation and what a nice piece to have as Lady Sings the Blues hits DVD this year (earlier in the year of course)."
5,Great music! Great arrangements! Great vocals!,"It is a shame this CD is not getting any promotion because it is wonderful and light years ahead of all the standards albums currently in release. Diana's interpretations are timeless and the musical arrangements superb. In an era of synthesized music, what a delight to hear an orchestra with real musical instruments."
3,diane iz boss!,"i'm a long-term dina ross fan & just the discovery of un-released material ""tweeks"" my ear-drums. however i must say that if you don't care for her enormous talent@ all then you wouldn't like blue which is a nice testament to her adaptations of jazz standards from the sizzling seventies!!!!!"
5,ROSS WAS & STILL IS THE BOSS!,"this lost Diana Ross album is a jazz masterpiece!it would have been released if she had won the OSCAR for best actress in 1972.so thank God it has been found ...get it * enjoy a master class in singing,charm & beauty!L.R. new york 2006"
5,"How could ""MOTOWN"" leave this one in the vault?","How could MOTOWN leave this one behind, and man is the ""Boss"", Ms. Ross really singing the blues! This material is timeless and will give Diana a grammy given that she has never won one (believe it or not). This material will showcase to the world that when this ""Lady sings the Blues"" your ""Love Hangover"" for legendary Diana Ross will go platinum. Smart move MOTOWN!"
4,really good collection,"Diana Ross is a Artist who understood styling more than so many other singers then or now. She understands adding character within a song&rolling off of it.the majority of the material here which is basically tracks from Diana's role in Lady Sings the Blues which was based on Billie Holiday's Life that were suppose to drop,but Motown tends to have so much in the vault. hard to believe that this collection has stayed behind all this time,but it still sounds good. the arrangements for the most part are cool. this is a collection of standards that deserve&Should be heard."
2,NO SURPRISE...,"A NEW ALBUM WITH NO SURPRISES... we are waiting for a good return to soul in seventies as good as love hangover, and all albums in these years... only and always ""remakes"" and compilations out of the ross'talent... think she's going to sleep now... blues is good of course, but all soul stars go to this style, and we need to dance on good music now... please diana ""stand up and dance now"", you're still (??) a soul voice but we don't need a return and perpetual rererereturn...joel - france..."
3,Fun for all the family,"The eclectism of Jonh Zorn is well known. Once again, he comes out with a ""pot-pourri"" of his wide musical influences (jazz, punk, surf, classical etc.). But is style of composition still is so fluid and so unique. Fun for all the family! ;-)"
3,Hiding under a blanket and telling each other ghost stories.,"Nick Redfern is always fun. I wouldn't trust him to read me a number from the phone book, but he IS fun. I make it a point not to miss his books.In ""The F.B.I. Files: The FBI's UFO Top Secrets Exposed,"" Redfern prints letters from the files of the F.B.I. about UFOs, cattle mutilations, men in black and gives his cockeyed take. It is both interesting and pathological."
3,Laughing at the man in the Orange suit!!!,"Yes I read the book and it actually does work. That is about the only good thing I can say about this book. As for the Auther LOL no I mean Scott well I would love to delve futher into his inventions to see were he really came up with it. I hope he is enjoying the food at the Carroll County detention center for the last few years as he must be stashing away the cash from the sales of this book. Which brings me to Timecast. Who is entitled to the profits? Agh a question to soon be answered. Well I wouldn't buy the book but it was given to me by one of his co-conspiritors opps Sp. So maybe you will get out of Jail one day and moveon to new territory with your book , strongputs and make us lots of money. [...]"
2,How many phenom can we blame on MPD/DID?,"Let's be frank, this book is terribly outdated. Published in 1982, the author uses only two MPD cases (Eve, Billy Milligan) to make his points. While Wilson admits that the connection between demonic possession and what we now know as MPD/DID existed in Biblical times, his claim that ALL personalities are demonic possessions is simply, well, jumping the gun. Poorly researched in that his resources were very limited. The book was published rashly.If you're seeking information on MPD/DID, start with Ralph Allison. If you're seeking information on reincarnation, try Sylvia Browne."
3,"Not his best, but has some nice moments....","Ok, this is NOT the place to start for first time Rundgren listeners (try Something/Anything?, Hermit of Mink Hollow or Nearly Human for that) but for all the negative comments on this disc, it does contain some fine moments. ""Hideaway"" and ""Influenza"" are wonderful pop tunes. Rundgren said he put little effort into this recording but sometimes the distance he puts between himself and the material makes some great (if not essential) pop music."
1,I have purchased this contract about 6 weeks ago. I have not recieved it yet. CUstomer service has not reponded to my request.,"I have not recieved the service contract 6 weeks after purchasing the Elliptical trainer and the service agreement. I recieved the Elliptical trainer 5 weeks ago. I am still waiting for the service contract. I have tried e-mail the customer service, but no responce as of yet.I am very unhappy with this process."
5,Great music . . what a show,"Love all their releases ! If you've never seen them live, you are missin out big time. Make it happen soon, but in the meantime, you'll love all their C.D.'s.D & M"
4,I guess I don't get it...,"I came to SLR being an avid bluegrass fan, as well as roots/country rock (early Grateful Dead, rockabilly, John Hartford, Doc Watson, SCOTS, you name it) and after two dedicated listens this disc just leaves me a little cold. I gave it 4 stars for the blistering performances, both vocal and instrumental, of songs that I just couldn't make myself care about. The lyrics are vague and never really told me a story I could visualize in any real sense. (No matter how hard I rubbed on the glass, I still couldn't see through it, if you take my meaning.) I guess I could sum it all by saying they use the bluegrass format to sing ordinary, uninspired rock. Albeit with tight harmony and hot instrumentals. Is it country rock or odd bluegrass? Neither fish nor fowl. I'm going to keep at it - maybe I'll ""get it"" at some point."
1,I returned it.,"I was very disappointed when this product came. I opened the box and hated it. The stones are tiny and cloudy. The settings that hold the stones are brighter than the stones themselves. Picture looks great, but doesn't look like that when it comes. Also it was very uncomfortable on the sides of my finger, it juts out on the sides."
4,Dutch Cooking,"My American husband bought this book in Holland before Katrina. We lost this book in the flood and found it used on the internet. It's a great book, because the recipes are written in English and there is an American measurement conversion chart in front of the book. The only downfall is that it doesn't have ALL the recipes that we were looking for."
4,Great book. Just mind the annoying typos ( not the authors fault!),"Read this when I was I high school and still love it.HOWEVER- one star deducted because this edition is rife with typos, as is each Kindle version in this series. It is clearly that these were scanned with an OCR algorithm. For $20 Amazon could hire someone to fix them all I am sure."
4,Great book - Lame Kindle version,"This book was not transcribed with any care or detail to attention and the story suffers because this is the case.Some pages have multiple typos - key words like ""torc"" are almost always misspelled as ""tore"" and names of key characters are outright slaughtered!Amazon should pull these books and have them done properly or refund people's monies until such time as the books are corrected."
3,Nice photos & inspiration...but light on the details.,"While a great resource for ideas and general instructions and projects, the majority of the food and crafts pictured in the book come with no instructions or recipes which is very disappointing. Even the items with instructions are pretty vague and rely on the reader knowing more than many novices might. Some of it might be cultural - maybe every Brit knows how to make a simnal cake and top it with an adorable molded marzipan rabbit on top - but this is one American food writer who doesn't!Overall, if you are looking for a book to provide general inspiration or just eye candy, then it is a great book for that use. However, if you are looking for specific crafts and recipes with detailed instructions to follow you might be better off looking elsewhere."
1,Not Much To Look At,"There's nothing here that any actor with half a brain couldn't find for him/herself by renting some good flicks. Why pay the extra money. At least when you rent the movies, you get the added enjoyment of watching them. Come on guys, are we all so lazy we can't transcribe a few film scenes for ourselves. Also, there is a lot of repetition in that some films are represented by as many as 3 different scenes. I think the author/editor might have worked a little harder for some diversity."
3,A lot of adult scenes...,"I am in a college acting class, and I have to say that even I think that a lot of these scenes are about pretty adult subjects, for example the hockey/parking garage fight from ""Chasing Amy,"" or all of the scenes from ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape."" (There are 4) I am also disappointed that almost all of the boy/girl scenes in this book involve the theme of sex or need the two actors to have some sort of romantic relationship or past. It's boring to do scenes involving romance like that for every scene in a class."
3,Resource book,"Not a bad collection of excerpts from the silver screen, but rather limited to choices of movies produced up to the year 1999."
1,Not good!!! No protection during shipping!!!!! Product destroyed,"The item was extemely poorly protected during the shipping. All it had was suran rap on it and that was it. Water got on it and destroyed the book. The pages were warped and damaged. Prior to this purchase, I have had good success with Amazon's system, but this was the worst. I learned an important lesson.I don't know if I can trust the system anymore.Michael"
5,pistol packin mama,"al dexter is one of the great singer of the 30's and 40's. this is what true country music is all about.i think he was much better than most of the more famous singer past, and all of the present. he doesn't have to have loud bands or flashing lights, just good pure music. this type of music is hard to find in this day and age."
5,Great Book,"This book was amazing. Very well written, extremely captivating story. This guy led a very interesting life and reading about it is a pleasure.Only problem is the ABSURD amount of typos and grammatical errors. I don't know how it happened but there are so many typos that it at times detracts from the book. Spelling errors, grammatical errors...it was like no one proofread the thing. However, please don't let this stop you from reading the book... it is THAT GOOD!!!"
5,Good book. Easy read.,"Good writing style. Easy to keep reading. If you have been in, or are interested in, the military this will be highly interesting to you. As the book moves along you are given more a view from the top and you get to see the thinking and the planning behind miliary campaigns.The general's view of the first Gulf War, as well as his earlier experience in Vietnam, is given in good detail.This book, at current used prices, is certainly well worth it.Lots of pictures in the hard cover version."
5,More than just a war book---the making of a great general,"A truly engaging book, not only in the great behind-the-scenes detail and insight that it provides on the Gulf War, but in the way in which it allows the reader to follow the making of the man. From his days in grade school, to living in Iran, to his world travels with the U.S. Army, to his tours in Vietnam, you can see how these experiences caused him to be so driven to conduct the Gulf War in the ""right"" way for the American soldier."
5,Great book,"I enjoyed this book immensely, but naturally, being in the Army I would. However, for some America's citizens, I am not sure if they would feel the same. There are many things in this book that deal with military life that only people in the military might find interesting. I am not trying to discourage people from reading this, but rather explaining that this is mainly the detailed life account of one of America's best 4 star generals. For those in the service, this is a must read. Notice how much Gen. Shwarzkopf cares for his troops. We can all learn a lesson from him."
1,Kindle version junk,"I own the hardcopy and wanted the Kindle version. What I got had so many errors, mistakes, misspellings, etc, as to be virtually impossible to read. (SHED instead of SHE'D - multiple times; ONF instead of ONE - multiple times; missing and extra quotation marks; missing and extra apostophe; TAD instead of BAD; HJPLSINGER instead of HOLSINGER; CLEAN instead of MEN, and much more) I realize it is sometimes hard to distinguish the correct word, especially on properly spelled words, but most (if not all) basic spell checkers should have caught many of the errors. The spell checkers usually also include a checker for proper grammatic usage. I notified both Amazon & Random (publisher) of the errors. By the way, Amazon said on 09/01/2011 that they were removing the title until the errors were corrected, but it has never been removed, so I assume they are still selling an error filled version."
4,must read,A very revealing look into an American solders life. The behind the scenes things we never had any idea that an officer had to deal with. The personel and professional things that go on during the career advancement of an american solder. I would recomend this book as a must read.
5,It doesn't take a hero,"I read this book several years ago and still remember it today. This book is very well worth the read and I even recommended it to a friend while we were on a trip. The following morning his wife called me to report that she did not sleep much the previous night because he was reading more than half the night. That day he stayed in their room and when he did emerge his comment was 'I can't put it down'. This book may be more for the guys but with that said, I still enjoyed the read. RIP 'Stormin' Norman'!"
5,incredable man,"This book is of THE greatest General of our time,an amazing leader and without doubt a born leader.The book is a MUST read and I could not put it down.Told with honesty and feeling for all who bother to read it in depth. As an Englishman I admire his plain talking from start to finish."
5,It doesn't take a Hero,The book came in very quickly. It looked like it was brand new. I am very happy with the service.
1,Don't buy from UnbeatableSale!!!!!,"Purchasing my item from UnbeatableSale has been a nightmare! The estimated delivery time advertised on Amazon is not adhered to. When I called customer service, they were horribly rude to me. A woman named Polly told me that estimated delivery time is written by Amazon, and that they are an outside company and have their own shipping schedule . I ordered my item for a Christmas gift, so I paid for 2-day shipping on December 14, it is now the 29th, and I still don't have my item."
5,K-On!,"amazing. came in great condition. came on time. came in mint condition. i would recommend this set beyond belief. for those that read the manga, it covers the first 2 books."
3,The Econometric Analysis of Transition Data,I want to make a tesis of duration models and this book is the appropriated
2,Another disappointment,"At first glimpse, this looks like a collector's dream: an economically priced collection of Webb Pierce's 4-Star, Pacemaker and early Decca sides. The 4-Star material has long been burdened with after-the-fact overdubs of additional instrumentation and vocal choruses, and one would hope that Proper would present it in its original unfettered monophonic glory. Sadly, eight of these tracks are still encumbered with the incongruous ersatz accompaniment that has made them unlistenable since the LP era: High Geared Daddy, New Panhandle Rag, Heebie Jeebie Blues, Sweetheart You Know I Love You So, I'm Happy You Hurt Me, English Sweetheart, Lucy Lee and Jilted Love.The good news is that the other 20 tracks appear in their original form with good sound. And it's cheap, so one can justifiably buy it and just skip over the offending tracks. But the question remains: Will the original, undubbed versions of Webb Pierce's 4-Star recordings ever be reissued? It's time!"
5,standard plaster of paris,"I am a teacher and make fossils for my students every year using plaster of paris. I have used this type and it was exactly like all of the other kinds I have used. I'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about, but this product is what it claims to be: plaster of paris- it's all the same. Some helpful hints: be ready to make a mess and be prepared to act quickly as it sets fast. That is the case, however, with any plaster of paris project. I am a fan of this product and I can't find a price that even comes close to this- what a deal!"
1,Wast of money,"This book is a waste of money. The author did not express his ideas well (actually he never really express any ideas, he just blabs). I would not recommend this book to anyone. Don't read unless you absolutely HAVE to!"
5,The Gingerbread Man Goes to School,I am a kindergarten teacher who likes to compare different books in the same genre. This book is excellent and good for the advanced reader afterward. They want to read it again and again! You can use it to springboard other ideas for future books to written by the children in the Writing Workshop (the Writing Process for us old folks)!Enjoy and get one!
5,Fun version,Purchased for a preschool gingerbread theme. We read and compared several versions of the story. This was one the children asked for again and again.
3,It works...,"I had only been using this for about 3 weeks when we were subjected to a terrible lightening storm. A saw a flash in the distance and all phones went dead. Upon further inspection, the only item in the whole house to take damage was this distribution unit. I am now ordering another one to replace it. I haven't yet used the DSL function."
5,This was a great book,"I thought this book was very good, but sad. Erin thought it was her fault that her sister Amy was put into a coma. It really showed how a family deals when a loved one is in a coma and they have to decide whether or not to donate her organs."
3,"""Not as inspiring as ohter books by Lurlene.""","""I liked other books by Lurlene MUCH better, it is not a really great book in my opinion. This book was just not as inspiring as other books by Lurlene."
4,A well-written good book about family strength.,"This is about Amy and Erin, two sisters 15 months apart inage. Erin is the nice, reliable sister where Amy is morereckless. When Amy is driving one night in the rain she isin an accident. Erin and her family go through the painfuldecision to donate Amy's organs.I loved this book. It was very well written. It was touching,realistic and even funny at times"
2,Nothing to be proud of,"This book is one of the most annoying books I've ever read. It's about two sisters, Amy and Erin. Amy is in a car accident and is in a coma. Erin, the annoying older sister, spends the entire book trying to convince herself that Amy is okay. Talk about denial. McDaniel herself and her characters have to face reality. Amy is comatose. She is not okay! Anyway, the family has to decide whether or not to donate Amy's organs after she becomes brain-dead. I disliked this book because i was boring. It ""went nowhere very slowly."" The characters were annoying and not well developed. Erin in particular bothered me because she seemed so naive and hopeful. I felt like giving her a good shake and yelling, ""Your sister is gone! Get over it!"" I do not recommend this book for anyone, because I cannot understand why anyone would enjoy it."
3,Not Her Best,"This is the first Lurlene McDaniel book I read and I loved it. Now that I have read others I feel that it is not her best. The book deals more with the healthy sister than the dying one. There also isn't much detail about how bad she really is. Overall, a good start but keep on going."
1,Cannot recommend,"When the flash arrived, the plastic housing over the bulb was cracked. I called the company and was given the option of mailing the flash back at my own expense for a replacement...but I should mention that the 'call back' process to the company in itself was a challenge...not user friendly and the customer service rep on the other end was short on customer service. Basically I felt that it was ""my"" problem to solve, not theirs. They could also not guarantee a return date for the replacement flash, which I purchased for my step daughter's wedding scheduled in one months time.The ""slave"" portion worked great in testing at home and in some preliminary use ... come the weekend of the wedding, and it stopped working all together for no reason (we replaced batteries, checked and rechecked the mechanisms). But the ""30 day return"" policy has expired so I'm the proud owner of a slave flash that doesn't work.Can't recommend either the product or the company."
3,Size too big for clown fish,"Con; it's a little too big for such a little fish so when you're working it through a story or drama, it feels clumsy.Pro: It has a nice texture, a little cuddly that the children like."
1,Tough read,"This book is a very tough read. It is written for a highly educated audience and is hard to follow. The book is poorly written, jumps around, and is not entirely factual. There are better books on The Spanish American War than this one."
2,Not impressed,"I bought this bag for my husband for Christmas. He travels a lot and goes through at least one bag a year. I wanted him to have something that looked nice and professional and this bag fit the bill. It does look very nice out of the box. I liked the leather. However, it is not well made and the quality is poor. It had scuffs and scrapes (not an old worn leather look which would have been fine) almost immediately and after only one month of use it had a tear in the leather on the back of the bag. After four months of use it looks so bad, my husband now needs a new bag. I do not recommend this bag."
4,Very nice bag for the money!!!!,"This is a really nice case, very durable and slick looking. It has quite a few compartments inside for various toys and gadgets, with a decent amount of space. I take my laptop and lunch to work daily in this and they both fit just fine. The leather is extremely nice, so much so that I honestly don't like taking it out in the rain.I only have two MINOR complaints about this, which is why it has 4 stars vs. 5.1) The strap tends to slide easily off the shoulder if the weight of the bag and contents aren't significant.2) The buckles aren't the easiest to get undone in the front. Sometimes they take a little work to get open..but again, these are VERY minor things. Great bag, great value, very happy with it thus far!!ThanksSS"
3,Wrong Colour!,"Ordered the Dark brown and they sent the tan! Because it was so near to Xmas I couldn't return for the right one. Luckily he actually liked the tan so it worked out in the end. I haven't asked him about it but he's using it everyday for work, so I guess he's happy with it."
5,Great Business Bag,I've been using this bag for about a week now. It serves every function that I need and has more than enough space. The leather and stitching look great. The bag is well padded internally for laptop protection (still wouldn't drop it with a laptop). It has a higher end look that what the cost would indicate. This is my second Kenneth Cole. The first one I used for over 5 years. This one appears well made and able to last as long. I have no problem recommending this to anyone.
1,Poor quality and no replacement offered,I bought this bag direct from Amazon and the shoulder strap broke within three months. Replacement period was only one month. Very disappointing.
4,Quality laptop case,"Sturdy bag with a lot of seperate compartments for pens, folders and gadgets. There is room for a medium sized laptop and a few extras. Leather and stitching is a nice quality. This should last for many years."
5,my opinion,Perfect size and light to carry with compartments. Great purchase! I would highly recommend this product to others as i keep getting complements from my co-workers.
4,Great bag!,"Bought this bag to replace another Kenneth Cole bag. Was very surprised when I pulled this one out of the box. It's looks exceeded my expectations. Rich looking leather that should wear well. It's not a Coach, but you're not paying for one either. Great buy for the money."
5,Great Service,"I absolutely loved the bag, it looks even better then in the picture and it was delivered in 2 days. :) can't wait to give it to my boyfriend for Christmas."
4,Ken Cole Bag,"I purchased this bag as a present. It is exactly as pictured. The dark brown bag has a slightly reddish tint to it, but I like the color alot. The leather is soft and has a slightly "" broken in"" look to it. The zippers and clasps work easily. The zippers have metal tabs, but the zippers themselves are a plastic/nylon material. The bag is that ""in-between"" sort of brief case...not formal, but not so casual as to look out of place with a guy wearing good,business casual clothing. For the money, this is a really nice bag. If you expecting a bag that's likely to last a lifetime, you better be prepared to spend more money. The attached tag says that the MSRP is $460. This is not a $460 bag by a long shot. But it's certainly worth the ~$125 I paid for it and I believe it will do it's job nicely for a long time if it's not overloaded and abused daily."
4,Its a great product,What I have seen in posting is the same based in expectation.I love it and it has a good quality....I can recommend it to my friends.
2,Nice Looking with Poor Quality Control,"Great looking bag that seems like its made of quality materials, but the assembly quality control is terrible. I have had 3 different bags now all with one problem or another right from the factory. I think the quality and construction may vary from the different manufacturing facilities Kenneth Cole uses for assembly. There is also a Samsonite bag that is clearly made by the same company / facilities that has the same issues (I know this because I bought one also).- First one - buckles kept sticking and the zippers were also sticking.- Second one - leather types did not match on bag / inconsistent dying of leather and corner started to come apart.- Third one - buckles would not stay snapped.I am contemplating just returning it all together. It's too bad because I really do like the bag a lot and it has a nice amount of space."
5,Good quality,"Good size for business travel, enough room for a short trip of a day or two, if you travel light, good quality, and looks formal."
1,no good,"I received this bag with strached surface. some very bad strached points on the back face.It is described for ""15.4 inch computer"" but received only for ""14.3"" inch computer. I am so disapointed.I will never buy this brand again for ever.Quite so unhappy shopping.Please write at least 20 words describing your experience with this item. Repeated words don't count."
1,Buyer beware - says in stock but not shipping for months!,"I was just notified that after purchasing this back ""in stock"", it will not ship until February. It still shows in stock. Huh?!"
3,Medium Quality,"I ordered this product because of the estimated good quality. I travel often and needed a bag for the day-to-day use as well. The bag does look nice out of the box. I liked the leather. However, it is not well made and the quality is poor. It had scuffs and scrapes out of the box. I don't know if these are supposed to look like an used bag but I did not like it at . I do not recommend this bag."
3,nice looking leather... for a while,"the product is nice looking but the leather gets ""scratchy"" and ""peels"" easily. it doesnt have the same kind of leather throughout the whole bag. space-wise its great. fits folders, a 14.1 inch laptop loosely, every attachment. amazing. i guess i was expecting a better quiality of leather... but overall its ok."
5,Beautiful bag!,"Bought this as gift for brother (very particular when it comes to his professional appearance!). He LOVES it, very nice quality, but way better than the photo. High grade, sturdy leather - perfect for computer bag or for briefcase that is very stylish and not ""nerdy"" - that was the requirement and the bag delivered!! Thanks!"
5,Stylish Bag for a great price!,"The photo of the brown bag is not representative of the actual bag's color. In the picture it appears to be 2 shades of brown (straps & body) but as it turns out the bag is one very nice rich dark brown color, with contrasting stitching. The bag has a bit of a distressed leather look, which is good because all leather will eventually get a ""worn"" look - I did not want a bag I had to worry about scratching or getting ""wear marks"" on. This bag will only get better with time and wear. I would say it is very stylish and not too stuffy like some leather bags. The price was excellent as most leather bags of this quality costs much more money. It holds a lot for a medium sized bag. I highly recommend it!"
2,I am also in the minority,"I would agree, it did not flow well at all. The story line bounces back and forth not sticking to a character and not going into detail with that character. Short I know, but did not flow. Adorable idea, and I agree the illustrations are great, but do not recommend this one."
3,Toot & Puddle : I'll Be Home for Christmas,"I seem to be in the minority here. I did not like this book at all. I did, however, think the illustrations were beautiful. I felt the book did not flow very well & the story was not that great either. Just my opinion"
3,Inspirational Poetry,"This is a very thin book with only 35 pages and about half of those are pictures. The art work is beautiful and helps illustrate the story. The story is actually in poem form (not the rhyming type) and tells a story of what might have occurred if Jesus had come to pay His respect and debt to the innkeeper that gave Mary and Joseph shelter on the night of Jesus' birth. The story takes place about a couple of days before Christ dies on the cross. The story (although brief) is thought provoking in that it tells of what loss the innkeeper experienced for his deed on that long ago ""Christmas"" night. It also ends with a promise that Christ gives to the innkeeper for his deed and through Christ's sacrifice. It is a book that is in keeping with the true meaning of Christmas with an eye on the meaning of Easter. I think this might be a good gift book for those who enjoy the true meaning of Christmas and a good Christian read."
4,The Imagination of a Pastor-Theologian Tells a Story,"What happens when one weds poetic expression with the imagination and thinking of a theologian?That is exactly what is found in this book by John Piper illustrated by the paintings of Glenn Harrington.Piper uses his imagination to tell a story in poetry about the visit of Jesus to the place where he was born and where after the flight to Egypt, children under two years of age were slaughtered by Herod's soldiers. The poetry touches the heart and tells the story of the great sovereignty of God that cannot be understood. Piper has Jesus saying:Ask me not whyThe one should live, another dieGod's ways are high, and you will knowIn time (33)Rather than relate the story told so warmly in poetry, read it yourself and at the same time enjoy the impressions given by the warm paintings of Harrington.Avoid saying that the author stretches his imagination too far but instead enjoy the images and truth that God reigns in spite of evil."
2,Speculative,"""The Innkeeper"" is a short (under 10 minute) read that will make you consider the wide reaching effect that Herod's decree to kill all males under 2 in an effort to put Jesus to death after His birth had. While there is no Biblical evidence that the Innkeeper and owner of the stable where Christ was born was the first to suffer from this decree, or that he lost all his family because of his willingness to lend his stable, it's a sweet story of Jesus returning to the Inn before His crucifixion to ease the Innkeeper's heartache.I'm not sure that I like books that put non-historical stories into the Bible - sure, that *could* have happened, we certainly know many lost their children because of Herod, but still, the story doesn't sit particularly well with me. The dedication is to any of who have lost a child and I wonder that any who had lost a child would actually find even the tiniest comfort from the story within. I don't think that I would."
2,Not very good poetry,"I'm actually pretty open to works filling in the backstories of minor characters in the Bible (I'm involved in church drama, and we do this quite a bit at Good Friday, for example), but I just felt like this wasn't done very well. Piper generates a backstory for the keeper of the inn where Jesus was born, but in the end the story doesn't go anywhere. Also, the poetry is just not very good."
4,Excellent picture book,This is an excellent picture book but I think that the child should be on the older side and already have some back ground on who the innkeeper was and what was going on during the story. John Piper is a really good author and delivers with this book. Another reviewer said that it was for Advent but I feel like it would be more for around Easter as Jesus is visiting right before he is put on trial. I felt for the innkeeper and really didn't give him much thought other than wht his part was in the famous story. This gives us one way that maybe his life could hve went.
3,"Beautiful Illustrations, but....","This book is a visual treasure. Glenn Harrington's paintings are just beautiful. But I was hoping for more from the story. Most of it dealt with how much the Innkeeper lost because he housed baby Jesus and his family. He lost his right arm, and his whole family, and most of the poem John Piper wrote is about this. Only a very small part at the end details what Jesus was to go on to do for US. I wish Piper had done more with that part of the story. Of course, we don't KNOW that this is what happened to the innkeeper, and we don't even know that the innkeeper knew that he was giving shelter to the Savior of the world.I really enjoy John Piper's writing, but this one left me wanting more of the story."
5,Tears to my eyes,This small little reflection on the Christmas story brought tears to my eyes. I hope you will listen with ears to hear and eyes to see the truth that is revealed. Beautiful! Thank you John for serving the Lord faithfully. SDG
3,Beautiful Paintings,"The paintings, within ""The Innkeeper"" by John Piper, are the best part of this little, but richly appointed book.Unfortunately I found the flow of the poem within the book a bit jarring and at times had to go back and re-read a line or two because I was confused as to who was speaking, Jesus or the innkeeper. The concept held within the poem is interesting, and not a possible connection I had ever thought of."
4,Classic Rundgren,"Often innovative and acknowledged for pushing musical boundries Hermit of Mink Hollow showcases his music at its most accessible. It is also probably Rundgren's most commercially successful album. The haunting ""Can We Still Be Friends?"" and the optimistic emotionally powerful ""All the Children Sing"" are Rundgren classics. There is a cool quirkiness to ""Onomatopoeia"" and Rundgren tugs at the heart strings with ""Hurting for You"" and ""Determination"". A must for any music collection."
5,I Forgot How Great This Album Is!!!,"I first picked up this album when it came out on vinyl back in the Spring of 1978 and quickly wore my copy out. I hadn't listened to it in years and, after hearing some Todd on the radio, decided to order a copy of ""Hermit"" on CD. It still holds up as the best thing that he's ever done. This album jumps around various musical stylings but maintains the Rundgren signature sound on every song. From the Zen message of ""All the Children Sing"" to the heartbreak of ""Can We Still Be Friends"" to the child-like playfulness of ""Onomatopoeia"" to the social commentary of ""Bag Lady"" to the Motown groove of ""You Cried Wolf"" (you'd swear it was the Funk Brothers backing this song), to the final release provided by ""Fade Away"". This is an amazing collection of music and would definitely be placed in my all-time top ten. Buy it, listen, and enjoy!"
4,A nice alternative to metal clips,"I've used these for years & I have to say, the clips have the pluses & minuses.PLUS:1) The clips don't tear pages like metal clips do.2) There's less of an indentation with these clips, which is a plus if you have to scan the paper into any type of feeder (copier, computer equipment).3) The clips are more colorful than their metal counterparts.4) Easier to use- no having to pry them apart like I would for some of the metal clips.CONS:1) The clips break easier than the metal clips do. (But they do put up with quite a bit of use & abuse!)2) The clips don't hold as much paper as some of the metal clips do.Overall, these clips are awesome. I'd just recommend that if you do need to clip more than 20-30 pages together in the long term you may want to give in & get some of those metal alligator clips."
4,For the Office,"I bought these to take to my office. They are very effective on the larger stacks of paperwork and they are frequently ""stolen"" by the ladies in my office."
4,Amazon Verified Purchase-Color Plastic Clips,The delivery was quick and the clips were just what we had been looking for but unable to obtain locally. They were larger then what we wanted but needless to say we had ordered the wrong size. Would use this source again.
4,An excellent starter book to master a superior vocabulary.,"This hard-to-get paperback book was first published in 1981, but it is still an excellent ""starter"" book if you have never tried to learn a lot of word meanings for a superior vocabulary before on your own. You will learn basic vocabulary and remember key words because of Peter Funk's clever memory tricks. After you have finished this book, other books such as the venerable dean of all vocabulary paperback books: ""30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary"" by Dr. Wilfred S. Funk and Norman Lewis and the effective reinforcement of ""Word Power Made Easy"" by Norman Lewis will be much easier for you. Highly recommended by John Thor Newlander, teacher of communication arts and English in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York. - 3/5/99"
4,Nice reading,"Short essays, most of them published in Time magazine. Hughes'keen and witty look at several artists - from great masters to contemporary ones. We don't have to agree with everything he says, but he's always objective, concise and inteligent."
4,Essays from the Great One,"Everything the late Mr. Hughes has to say is razor sharp and true.The major problem with this book is the SIZE OF THE TEXT, which is minuscule to the point of being straining, and the terrible quality of the paper on which it's printed.I miss him already and as an artist I only wish he were still here to critique and correct the ludicrous state of today's art ""scene"". There are many days of the year that reading a few words from Robert Hughes is the only thing that gets me to work."
5,For those who truly love literature..,"The Alexandria Quartet is an island read...Have you ever read literary criticism, perhaps by Rene Welleck? It's all there, the poetry , the imagery, the pyschology and humor and intrigue. The pages splash up onto your psyche like tiepolos of a distant past in an Egypt more real than the actual. This (these) are THE BOOK. A must read."
3,Very Funny,The writing is not a master piece or close to great. If you are looking for a light reading and having a good laugh try this book. The key is not to take things seriously.
1,Waste of my money and time,"I did not enjoy reading this book at all... I don't know why others say that it is funny. It is silly and boring. It is the life story of a loser Iranian who can't adapt, sucks at being a husband and a father, and his parents are worst than himself. Poor writing. DO NOT take this on the plane, you will be bored. You are better off reading the safety instructions on the plane!"
1,Never received the book,"We ordered the book in hope of getting it for Valentine's Day, around February 14. Have yet to receive it as of March 18. ??"
3,Review,I found this book an easy read and easily kept my attention. But once I stepped away from the book I was actually astounded by the actions of the characters and how little remorse there was. I seems they were consumed only by themselves and never considered how their immoral actions may affect the lives of others.
3,Healing and hope,"Waiting for Odysseus is a story of healing and a story of hope. Ramos does an excellent job illustrating the main character's emotions. I easily felt her pain and hope for love again. Very sad, but good read."
2,Sad.,"I read this for my book club and I wanted to give an honest review. So here goes...I did not like the book, although it's not the worst book I've ever read.The heartache and suffering was dull and very long-winded. I also couldn't empathize with Jesse. I found her character shallow and with little to no moral fiber. She had broken up a marriage, which is wrong regardless of cirumstance. If he was unhappy he should have gotten a divorce, not had an affair. Then at the end, she started sleeping with another married man (with a baby). I felt like she was missing out on her own life; she was only getting other people's left-overs. I found it very sad. I kept waiting for Jesse to have a life altering epiphany and it just didn't happen.To leave on a positive note, I did like the weaving of Homer's, Odyssey throughout the book, and the interesting analysis of the breaking apart of a person's different emotional parts/selves."
5,Our Greatest Journey,"Waiting For Odysseus, by Janell Ramos, is a soulful look into the passion of one woman's life and how amazing and painful the search for belonging can be. Ramos passionately tells the story of our greatest journey...the journey home. Using Homer's Odyssey, she weaves an ancient theme of love and longing for home into a modern tapestry. It was written with an honesty and truth that could only be possible by one who has actually tasted the sweet beauty and exquisite sorrow of this universal quest. It is an affirmation of our existence. A must read."
5,"Growing Herbs from Seed,Cutting & Root:An Adventure in Small Miracles",This book was in perfect condition and was shipped very quickly. Excellent! It's perfect for someone who has never grown herbs before; the instructions and directions are exact. It's very easy to read and to follow.
5,Mathematics with applications,"The product came really fast, way before the due date. It was in good top notch shape. Almost like new!"
5,Reaching for the Stars - a Must Have for the serious breeder,"Finally, a dog breeding book that goes beyond the more simplistic aspects of dog breeding. This book breaks breeders into seven categories, from beginner through top breeder and outlines the pitfalls encountered at each level and what it takes to become a good or top breeder. The author is not concerned with the how-tos of breeding a litter, rather she concerns herself with the topics of why breeders fail and leave the sport, how to keep your kennel size manageable and how to breed a Labrador that is as at home in the field as it is in the showring.This book was incredibly helpful and insightful, although one has to overcome the author's incredible bias towards the British, while condemning the Continental and American ways of doing things at every turn.I would sincerely recommend this book to anyone who has already read the ""how to"" books and is looking for more in-depth information about other aspects of breeding."
3,Is this in english?!,"It's a difficult book to read. It assumes you are at graduate or post-graduate level and already know a lot about the topic. I am working on my Master's in Interaction Design and I found myself being forced to re-read paragraphs because I had no idea what I just read! On the other hand, the book goes deep into HCI issues and methods and often leaves you with good research questions. If you're looking for a book to help you with real issues related to interface design or product usability, this isn't it. This book is all about theory. It's boring at best.It all comes down to this: If you're all about theory, this book is for you. If you want to be able to apply what you read to real-world situations - get something else."
1,Bad description,"I was not satisfied at all with the purchase. The book content is what was expected. The description of the status of the used book was way off. I ordered a book WITHOUT ANSWERS and there was no mention in the description of the book that the answers were written in. I emailed the seller multiple times with no answer to try to resolve the issue. I paid only $10 less than I owuld have for a brand new book, and had to white out most pages. Very frustrating."
3,Not Much About The Boss,"I'm sure most baseball fans will find this book enjoyable and informational, it pretty much reads like a history of the last 25 years with the Yankees. There's not much dirt about the Boss here, and the seasons are covered so fast that's it tough to remember what year the author is talking about half the time. The front of the book also promised ""updated information about the 2000 season!!"" but that info wasn't in my copy."
1,"Nothing all that interesting, Allen too full of himself","I was hoping to learn some interesting things from the Steinbrenner era being a huge Yankees fan. I figured, hey it's only $6.95 can't go wrong right? Wrong. Allen adds very little new information about the Yankees. The fact that he despises Thurman Munson because *gasp* Thurman never gave him any good quotes is ridiculous. He takes great glee in his petty revenge of refusing to vote for him on Hall of Fame ballots. I lost interest in this book right about there. As previously mentioned, the only real interesting chapter is on the Peterson-Kekich wife swap. Allen is a very vindictive man and I lost all respect for his opinion following this book. Not worth a read."
4,A GOOD LOOK AT THE PIN STRIPES,THIS IS A BOOK THAT YOU LIKE ALOT OR DISLIKE ALOT. I LIKED IT ALOT. IT GAVE ME SOME INTERESTING INSIGHT INTO THE EGO EMPIRE OF GEORGE. SOME GOOD GOSSIP ABOUT SOME OF THE PLAYERS AND SOME HILARIOUS STORY TELLING BY MR. ALLEN. I ENJOYED THIS BOOK AND RECOMMEND IT AS A GOOD READ.
2,A Book That Misses The Mark,"This book is a perfect example of the importance of truth in advertising. If Maury Allen wanted to write a book that provided an overview of his prolific sports writing career I'm sure that there would have been many interested readers. However, he has chosen to write that book and disguise it as a book about the Yankees. Sure, the focus of the book for the most part is on the Yankees, but Allen presents little that the average Yankee fan has not already seen. He also interrupts the narration on the Yankees with stories from his personal experiences that have nothing to do with the Yankees. There are no insights here for Yankee fans, which would be fine if he didn't promise a book about George Steinbrenner's years of ownership with the Yankees. Don't waste your time with this book."
2,Not a serious book. It's in the pile to donate.,This book is OK as an introduction.Anyone who is interested in doing real work on their space will need much more information.
2,Not a good first book for Feng Shui,"While this book is good in providing real-life examples, I found her examples were too situation-specific. She shows real situations that don't apply to my own, hence, most of the book was unhelpful. This is not a particularly good book if you want to know what to do specifically - unless the examples in the book match your own. Her suggestions of what you can do to improve a room are either too broad or too specific to the particular case she uses. I've seen more helpful hints on the Internet than in this book, and do not recommend it unless you have other Feng Shui books. Not completely useless, you can use this as a supplement."
3,the western guides to feng shui,This was a good book but we would appreciate if the author would go deeper in the subjectBut still a good book for new readers about the subject....
1,The only book that wasn't too negative,"Feng Shui is a very negative system. This book wasn't as bad as the others. It was invented from an ancient poem and the reading of dead bones from graves. Someone came up with this system that seems to threaten you every step of the way. Your home, entrance, bed, couches, etc must all be positioned a certain way or else you have bad luck in finances romance and life in general. It's all nonsense and doesn't work. Save your money and remain happy in life. Putting purple paper in your desk will not create money for you."
1,The Western Guide to Feng Shui: Room by Room,"I purchased ""The Western Guide to Feng Shui,Room by Room"" by Terah Kathryn Collins back in August. Since that time, my finances have gone all out of whack! I made changes that were to benefit my financial well being, but instead, by the end of each month, I have maybe $5 left in my bank account. A lot of the money has gone towards car repairs...it's been in the shop three times in the last month, and the repairs have reached the $1,000 mark.Also, just purchasing the supplies to make the changes ... crystals,fountains, linens, paint, etc. have taken it's toll on my wallet. A friend suggested that it takes time for the energy to change for the better, however I would expect status quo, not a total reversal of fortune!What did I do wrong..."
2,so-so,"When I bought my house, I wanted to go Feng-Shui all the way... Well, after using this book as a guide, I can tell you, I know just as much about the topic as I did before buying it. It sits on a shelf, until I can regift it to someone who is moving!"
2,Beware of the difference,"This is a fine book IF you knowingly purchase it as a guide to WESTERN feng shui. Western is a modern adaptation of the classic feng shui (which is thousands of years old). Instead of using a compass very carefully to determine where things are to be placed, one is told to simply use the door to a room as the starting point. That means that everything ends up in a different place from where the compass tells you. I was simply not comfortable with the suggestions which are all meant to accomodate a western lifestyle. I prefer the scientific approach."
1,Too basic and repetitive.,"I was very disappointed with the content of Ms. Collins book, which is an extremely quick read. After buying this book on impulse, I felt swindled by this amateur feng shui consultant.The book focuses on the practical elements of Feng Shui: don't place your bed or desk so you can't see the door, don't buy furniture with dangerously sharp corners, clear away clutter by throwing away what you don't need or love. These common-sense ideas are repeated ad nauseum for each room of the house. A good writer would have cut half of the text.If you like books such as ""Who Moved My Cheese?,"" which I hated because it was overly simplistic and made a two-page paper into a book, you will not like this book.If you want a very quick read, simple ideas, and some horrifyingly bad pictures, be my guest.Maybe I'm a hypocrite; I did follow one bit of her advice. After reading the book, I threw it in the trash."
3,Joey Dee in Hollywood/Hey Let's Twist,If your looking to complete your Joey Dee collection...This is part of it. Other than the hits it seems to go by unnoticed. There's nothing memorable about this album but you won't shut it off either.
3,Cute holiday movie,"This is the story of the Rodriquez family. It's Christmas in Chicago and their grown children are coming home for a visit. There's brother Jesse who's just come home for good, from Iraq. Sister Roxanna, home from Hollywood and brother Mauricio who's home with his Jewish wife Sarah (Debra Messing).It's a cute holiday movie, with some great actors. There were definitely some moving storylines but I found there were so many characters that it seemed to dilute the whole story somehow.It reminded me of a cute, holiday TV movie, with less humor and more drama then I expected."
4,Great Movie,"My wife and I really enjoyed all the family dynamics in the movie. For me personally, certain parts made me think of growing up in my family. I watched it for a course I'm taking, but it was well worth it."
4,Latin Holidays,"Nice movie. I was looking for something like ""This Christmas"" with a Spanish twist. This is one my family will watch next year too"
5,New,"The DVD came in just a few days and is brand new. Great film. My wife is Puerto Rican. This is what happens when Puerto Ricans get together. At first it's all good and everyone is so happy to see each other. Then, a huge disagreement evolves into fighting and bitterness."
2,"holiday movie, not funny",this was told to me by a friend that this was a really funny movie for the Holidays. It wasn't. it is sad and a bit pathetic. I prefer Christmas Vacation.
4,Really fun with a twist,"This is a fun movie - lots of hilarious moments with a great ensemble cast. You get the feeling that the actors had a lot of fun when they did this film.Beside being funny it also makes some valuable statements about family life, forgiveness, healing and accepting our humanness.An altogether warm viewing experience - something there for every generation!"
2,Nothing like this movie,"This isn't a feel-good holiday movie. In fact, you kind of feel bad for this family - and the movie. It's a really odd and uncomfortable assortment of hoodlums, war vet, high-powered hedge-fund managers, and bickering parents. At points, the movie seems to gel and convey a poignant story - particular Debra Messing and her father-in-law. But at other times, it seems as if ""Nothing like the Holidays"" is torn between several themes and was emotionally confusing. At the end of the day, the movie just tried to include too much and be too many things. That's too bad, because if it had scaled back its ambitions, ""Nothing like the Holidays"" could have been pretty decent."
3,Cute holiday time story,"This is not a great movie, by any stretch of the imagination, but I am one of those that likes most of the cast in this. That being said, I enjoyed the time I spent watching it. Some humor, some schmaltz, some cliches - but it's all okay if you are in the right mood. You've seen it before and you'll see it again, I'm sure."
5,I love Christmas!,"This is an awesome holiday movie. It is about one of the most important things around the Holidays... Family!Like every family, they have their share of problems, let downs, excitement and joy and this movie contains a perfect blend of all.The extras were great and a nice surprise... always like to see the bloopers and they even included a reunion.This movie was funny and is not your typical Family Holiday movie... it is still heartfelt and genuinely awesome in it's own sort of way.If you like Christmas stuff I highly recommend you checkout Nothing Like The Holidays!"
4,A great holiday movie for anyone with family drama,"This movie starts out slow, but is worth waiting through the slow beginning. It's all about families and their drama and how people come together when crisis occurs and how important it is to never assume. Many assumptions where made during the movie and all found out to be wrong...just like most people's family drama. I liked how each character was developed and how they each came through in the end to doing what is right and good. I recommend this movie."
5,NOTHING LIKE THE HOLIDAYS,THIS WAS A GOOD PRODUCT AND I LIKED ALL THE OLD ACTORS AND ACTRESSES IN THE FILM THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT.
3,Worth seeing once,"At the beginning of this movie, I thought the characters were trying just a little too hard, but as the story progressed, I found myself drawn to them. Sure, some of the storyline was a little melodramatic, but the ending was satisfying, and things resolved nicely. And I have to say it was nice to see familiar landmarks from Chicago, being a fan of that great city."
3,Great cast; so-so movie,"""Nothing LIke the HOlidays"" is an ensemble comedy that follows a trio of Puerto Rican siblings on their way home to Chicago for a Christmas season family reunion. It is more of a drama with comic highlights rather than the laugh out loud comedy it is touted to be in the description. It has a stellar cast, but the story itself is a little predictable and at times sappy. Definitely more of a movie to watch when it comes on television rather than seeking it out for purchase and watching repeatedly."
3,3.5 is what I'd like to give it.,"This movie is warm and affectionate, portraying the sweet and frustrating atmospherics of a family get-together rather than playing on bizarre family dynamics for laughs. But when the movie decides to get ""important,"" it slides into the hackneyed and predictable. I enjoyed the first 2/3. The acting is wonderful and carries the movie, and the set design and execution is faithful and perfect. You truly felt that you were inside a home, and happy to be there. I only wish the same meticulous attention would have been paid to the plot. It's a Christmas movie, so a certain level of triteness is expected, but it could have been more ""The Family Stone"" and less Lifetime Network Presents with just a little more work."
4,Worth watching,"I got this mostly because I like Debra Messing and I really liked her in this role. The movie is not what you'd call spectacular or award winning, but it's cute and good for a few laughs. It would be a good movie to bring when visiting family for the holidays. There would likely be at least one character everyone could relate to."
5,Excellent for Children and Adults,"Initially, I borrowed this CD from a teacher at my son's Preschool. We enjoy it so much that we've purchased an original copy from Oy Toys. Amazon appears to no longer carry it. I LOVE the song selection. My son, particularly, enjoys the song ""Tot Shabbat."" He'll request it. We listen to this CD while in the car for long or short trips. It's a Must Have!! I love it."
1,Palestinian Apologist,"Don't waste your money reading this one-sided diatribe. Surprise, the Palestinians decided not to accept the UN resolution giving them a state in 1948, thus, Bethlehem has been the site of fighting ever since. The author fails to mention that Christian holy sites are protected from the ransacking of his fellow Palestinians by those ""horrible"" Israelis."
3,"Has promise, but doesn't achieve it.","I really long for the record that perfectly melds that classic improvisational, swinging aspects of jazz with innovative techno music.This record sort of encompasses that, but doesn't quite hit the mark. The techno beats are nice and don't fall into any predictable rhythm, but the jazz pieces are few and far between. Basically it doesn't sound or feel like there's a 'live' jazz person involved, it's all just soulless computers."
5,Long-lasting performance,"I normally don't write product reviews, but the only other review of this apparently discontinued product is a negative review that is geared toward dissatisfaction with the supplier rather than the product itself. Product reviews should be of the product.I have an RV on a permanent lot in a vacation area that I visit once-per-month. I've tried just about every holding tank treatment I've been able to acquire and this is the only one I have ever used that kept the tank fresh between visits. Read the labels on other products - 7 days max and I haven't found another one that lasts even that long.Unfortunately, I've been unable to find this treatment for well over a year and assume it's been discontinued."
3,good for housekeeping,"enjoyed this book. But most of it was common sense. Very excellent for re-purposing and saving money to make 'magic' happy in every space of your life and home. There is a soulfullness, hippie, self-help feel to it. But if your not scared of that then you'll enjoy it."
1,Well Written but Obscure?,"The book was well written and had a lot of interesting cures and remedies. However, a lot of the obscure remedies contained stuff I had never heard of and the author does not even give a hint as to where to get the items for his recipes --- other than being interesting reading, the book is of little use."
5,Forget the haters below,"As with all the Numero Group releases, this collection is a pock marks and all look at a weird but cool sub genre that is just now coming into light. Fans of Linda Perhacs, Joni's dark work (Last Time I Saw Richard, Blue), or Ruth Ann Friedman should take note. If you're expecting PP&M; or other revival sounding folk, move on. My favorite track is ""Eternal Life"" by Shira Small, which sounds like nothing else ever made on this planet. Bizarre and beautiful, youthful yet not young sounding.Private folk is another untapped musical genre that the Numero Group have resurrected, let's hope there are others waiting to be found as well."
2,hoping for more,"i am a huge folk music fan, and grew up in the 60's. when i read about this cd i couldn't wait to hear it. sadly after a few listens i really do not feel that any of these songs stand out, or are worth listening to again."
1,Most of these singers are unknown for a reason,In a word: AWFUL. This is a waste of time and money and music. The one star is for the excellent Caroline Peyton track and conditional kudos to Barbara Sipple's voice but lousy song. The rest of it is unlistenable. Miserable. It really doesn't get much worse than this. Find Peyton's old stuff from the 70's and forget this junk.
2,So bad it's sad,"I was hoping for some undiscovered gems, but all I found were some pretty sad songs by a bunch of Joni Mitchell-wanna-bes. Save your money -- or just buy one of Joni's early albums. Or for that matter, buy ANY of Joni's albums!!"
3,Looks professional while it lasts,"So being a certifiable nerd, I go through lab books like there is no tomorrow. Every time I get a new one, I have to go through all the trouble of taping a business card to it and inevitably making it look like a kinder dropout stole some scotch tape. When I first got these card holders, I thought it was great! They look good and a few fellow lab nerds even asked where to get them. Unfortunately, a few times in and out of my bag and the top cover ripped right off. Nice! I would take the blame for it. I do tend to be hard on the equipment. However, all the other nerds did the same things even the nice, gentle, feminine nerds."

2,First year picture frame,"We purchased this frame when we had our son. We like it because it was simple and cute. The only draw back is that the picture frame openings for the first 11 months are almost too small, you can't really see the face that much...the picture has to be really small and so you don't get to see much facial detail through the small opening. You also have to make sure you take really small facial shots of your little one to fit it into the frame, I'm still working on finding one from some of the months that will fit. I would make a point each month of taking some small pictures of their head only...because that's all you'll have room for."
3,Baby's First Year Picture Frame,"Nice item, just do not like that it is not shipping to APO. Have to ship to my friend address and asked him to forward it to me. Too much..."
5,Dope. Dope. Dope.,"So so sick, I have watched this over and over again - never gets old. Gets me so effing amped for ski season..."
3,Talking heads,"The novel deals with timely issues, but the characters are closer to being talking heads than real flesh and blood. The structure is a linking of one extended presentation of ideas after another. I kept hoping for real characters to emerge to allow lived in contexts to shape the ideas. The snow metaphor is quickly hackneyed through too much repetition. Our author appears to not yet be a novelist, really; he seems more interested in ideas than people - or in putting the two together."
4,Identity Crisis,"It was interesting to read this after De Bernieres'BIRDS WITHOUT WINGS, as an examination of religion and politics in now-modern Turkey, the rise of militant Islamism, the ambiguous place of Turkey betwen Europe and the East, and much more. It is also a social comedy, a thriller situated somewhere between Greene and Kafka, a meditation on poetry and the theatre, and a love story. Pamuk plays tricks with narrative, plays tricks with time, and veers between realism and fantasy in a way that makes you doubt which is which. Reading as I was in translation, I was not sure how much of the strangeness was deliberate, and though fascinating. it made for difficult reading. So not quite the full five stars, but undoubtedly a major work."
2,Badly translated or badly written?,"Not sure which one it is: whether the book was lost in translation or whether the author did not know what he was doing.Very hard to read, raises many questions and does not provide many answers, you get lost in duration of the events described in the book (how long does Ka spend in Kars : 1 week or 1 year?), weird references to newspapers being published in advance describing events that are yet to happen like they can foresee the future (i.e. Ka will write a poem called ""Snow""), the whole idea of girls wanting to wear headscarves as their religion asks of them, but at the same time ending their lives with a suicide (which is a far great sin than not wearing a scarf, I believe) seems absurd. Many, many things make you raise your eye browse and then leaving you annoyed as you cannot find answers to all your questions. I forced myself to finish the book as I was hoping to find answers. No luck. Waste of time."
1,Poorly translated and poorly written,"Could not finish this novel, and was flabbergasted that this author was given the Nobel. The translation was at times so bad that I just could not believe that the translator was fluent in Turkish. The story was tedious and the repetition about head scarves, atheism, fundamentalist Islam, etc. were off-putting. I threw the book in the garbage after 200 pages of odious reading!"
4,"reading ""Snow"" now...","This musy have been a true ""labor of love"" for this author...I find it so interesting because this is not the style of writing I am use to...I am about half way thru and am captivated by this author's words...."
4,Very fast arrival.,"I'm giving this a 4 star review because of how fast I received it. I bought it for a paper in psychology that was due one week after my finding out about it, and this book arrived within 3 days. Thanks :)"
1,Possibly worthy but turgid,"I quite agree with all the one star reviews. Really hard work to maintain an interest. Pamuk's themes are now very well known. The endless introspective, arcane comment and reflections on the tensions between the west and the east, freedom and restriction, secularism and the supernatural, islam and christianity etc etc just did not hold me. I suspect that those who gave it 3+ stars felt obliged to run the race to the end because the book promises to enlighten us. The snow metaphor was vey overworked, in the end I felt I couldnt clear anymore from my driveway."
3,"Good book, too slow?","This book is a deserving award winner, one that combines many concepts such as political strife and religion into one story. But, as with many award-winners, the book takes too long to captivate ones attention. I believe that the book started to pick up an agonizing 100 pages in, too long for the average person. However, once it does, it doesn't stop. Orhan Pamuk creates a three-layer cake of reality distortion. You have the story of Ka, the narrator Orhan, and your opinion all going on at once. It makes for an interesting experience, though i wish that this would've occurred out of the get go."
4,An almost great book,"I've read a few of the reviews on Amazon, and I agree that Snow might have gotten the Nobel Prize for its bold political views. I also agree that there are times when the novel loses its grip. Lost in translation? Maybe, although I think the translator did a pretty fine job as far as the prose is concerned.However, that said, what blew me away in this novel was the Dostoevsky-like venture into Ka's volatile mental state. Pamuk described it faithfully as it snaked between extremes, through self-destruction and confusion and a desperate quest for happiness. In the end, I was spellbound by Ka's changing state of mind. As a character study, I give Snow five stars.Also worthy of mention is Pamuk's poetic (and at times unconventional with repsect to western literature) descriptions of Kars, the snow and the ensuing mood. Pamuk creates a surreal world out of Kars, and there were times when I felt I was wandering through Kars myself.Overall, definitely worth a read."
2,Metaphorical Stew,"This is my first book by this author. I assume he will be a nominee for the Nobel prize someday soon...they love work that is dense, poetic and thoughtful. Unfortunately this book lacked a soul. I will continue to read this author as he is a man of enormous intellect and literary imagination. I would just like to see if he can render life as it is really lived...if he will allow the blood and guts of human beings to seep into his crystal palace."
2,Book Club book only,I wouldn't read this unless you have a forum to discuss it in or a long vacation to read it on. I think being more familar with the culture would have helped my enjoyment. There is so much over-the-top drama to make specific statements but was too much for my taste. It is interesting to get other's takes on it as you discuss it - def some original scenes. I also really hated the font - way too small - find a large print if you decide to get this.
2,Hard Read,"I found this book to be incredibly depresssing. The story is a bit convoluted and takes careful attention, part of which is due to the writing style. The book illustrates a number of issues which are worthy of thought and discussion, but the presentation made it difficult for me to read and I had to force myself to finish it.My book club read the book and was evenly divided between those who truly enjoyed the book and those of us who didn't. At least one of us found it to be humorous, but I cannot say that I found any humor in the story what-so-ever."
1,Could Not Read It,"This is one of those supposed literary books that a friend insisted I read. I have conveniently forgotten which friend it was, probably because I want to retain the friendship. This book was so slow, so boring, so uninteresting in every respect, that I simply could not continue. Who is this book for, anyway? If it's written for the READER, then the author should make some literary attempts to REACH the reader. I suspect that books such as this are written for the writer and for nobody else. Well, maybe for a few people who aren't interested in certain aspects of fiction, such as scenes in which there is conflict, tension, rising action. I have noticed that when it comes to what's deemed ""literary fiction,"" narrative seems to suffice. But narrative alone is boring. Like this book, unfortunately."
3,Lots about headscarves,"I still haven't finished this book -- listening to it in my car. It is long, I am beginning to tire of all the discussions about headscarves. However, I am going to continue because it tells me about Turkey, about political islam (including the headscarf issue) and it is well-written."
5,He is Nobel Prize Vinner...,What can I say? He got the Nobel!I wish you could read this and other novels of Orhan Pamuk in his own language! You should also try other Turkish novelist... Including Yasar Kemal and his book Memed the Hawk...
2,Hard to pick up again,"Although this book was slow at many points, there were part which were interesting. I found it very hard to finish."
2,Lost in Translation?,"Maybe something got lost in translation but I think the wording and the sentences uttered by Ka and others seemed as if they were written by 5th graders. I couldn't imagine people talking like this. I forced myself to finish the book but the wording just ""hurt my ears"". I read it based on the New York Times basically saying it was a great book. This was not a great book, but maybe the translation was just bad?? Also, I am not sure if the author meant it or not but I got the impression from the writing and story that Turkish people aren't that bright. It seemed to me he was putting down the muslim religion. Anyway, that was minor, the writing was just bad, bad, bad. If you want to read stories that flow and wording that is like music to your ears (even though translated) read works by Naguib Mahfouz, especially The Cairo Trilogy. Now that is good stuff!!"
2,Too much snow,"I bet if you could remove every reference to snow in the book (any paragraph describing it), the book would be half as long.I never identified with any of the characters; never felt any sympathy for them.I was happy when the book was over."
2,Couldn't get through it,Well written but it didn't grab me like I hoped it would. I was never as interested in the protagonist as I should have been.
4,Snow CD,The book can be repititous so hearing it on CD offers the opportunity to re understand confusing characters and places. The narrator is excellent and the text is very well done. The book is longish but if one has time to read and listen it is a very worthwhile listen/read.
4,Snow a journey through the headlines,"The novel Snow is one that invokes one to examine how they feel about many current events going on in society. The novel deals with terrorism, Islam, and military coups. Those three points are found in today's headlines so much that the book becomes so realistic for it. The characters all have a role to play either taking the side for or against fundamental Islam or impacts the way one of the other characters think. Orhan Pamuk's writing style draws one into the story it tells you have events that are going to happen before they occur to keep you interested and reading more to find out how something happened."
2,Incredibly DENSE,"3-15-2012. As stated in another review, SNOW must be classified as an ""impenetrable political novel."" After 95 pages or so, I was overwhelmed by the DENSITY and minutiae of conversation and thought involving the polemics of God, Islam, and church-state separatism. For other readers, e.g., philosophers, seekers of the truth, and/or religious dogmatists, however, I can conceive that they may find the story enjoyable and potentially satisfying. For those of you who are already reasonably ""centered"" or otherwise comfortable with the inner self and its relationship with the play of the universe, you may find the book too boring to finish, as did I."
4,Revealing,"The main character, a poet, returns to his hometown in Turkey to write a story about girls committing suicide over the right or denial to wear a headscarf. He becomes involved in the political and religious turmoil simply by being there. The story portrays the life of the poet, his love affair, and his passion to write poetry amidst the fundamentalist struggle for power.It is a good read."
2,Not sure what the fuss is about...,"I just didn't enjoy this book. I don't mind so much that a book isn't plot driven if the language is beautiful and the ideas stimulating. With this book, however, I didn't even find the language poetic or evocative. And the ideas were so repetitive and expressed so turgid that I stopped reading half-way through. I really thought this book could do with a whole lot of editing. It was unsubtle, self-indulgent and dull. Perhaps something got lost in the translation? So disappointed. I had been eager to read this book for ages and when it was finally available at the library I was very excited. Oh well."
2,"Snow as ""political""???","I absolutely love Orhan Pamuk's work. LOVE it. And Snow is better than most other books that I've read recently. That said, Snow gets a 2 because every other Orhan Pamuk book is a better read than Snow, and they are all just as political. I find it very strange readers believe Snow is ""important"" & ""political"" when it deals with the same themes and issues that permeate all Orhan Pamuk's work: being able to truly know yourself as a Turk in the context of Western oppression and a country situated literally on the divide between east & west, europe & asia. My advice: buy a different Pamuk book, you will enjoy it much more. Then read it a second time and pay attention to identity and power issues."
3,An important book,"It is left to the novelists to make sense of a world that is riven by Islamism, secularism, militarism, and the rest, because the advocates no longer convince anyone. So Orhan Pamuk has done a tremendous service to Western readers by seriously, though fictionally, examining the secular/religious/military conflicts of modern Turkey. He has wrapped this astute political novel inside a love story that is often touching, then thrown in some thriller effects, and magic, heavy symbolism and poetry to boot. In short, it is too much of a mishmash. And the translation is rather clunky. But SNOW, for its seriousness and insight, demands to be widely read."
2,Disappointing,"Only good thing about this book is the intensity of the dialogue and the rich portrayal of characters, but this doesn't hold up till the second half of the book; the rest is cliche arguments that could in no way have come from the actual people involved in the setting. Pamuk really starts making characters say the things that are more stereotypical than actual, real, or even relevant to the discussion being portrayed. I agree with lots of the reviews here. The book does confuse and annoy. I left this book twice and read others then came back to it, each time with the hope I could see it with a fresh eye, until in the end I dropped it at the last quarter, too tired of the continuous dragging on and on which I assumed would only continue to the end, leaving me unsatisfied.May God bless my mother's soul, but it really would have helped if she'd taught me a thing or two about Turkish. I'd much rather read the original Turkish because maybe, just maybe, the problem is in the translation?"
2,Mud,"Would have been a more apt title because this was like a slog through it. Lost in translation? Maybe. Characters were without exception difficult to give a damn about, self-indulgent, selfish, silly. Could go on but won't except to say it was a ride thru Kars i couldn't wait to be over."
3,Parts greater than the sum...,"Snow , the latest from celebrated Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk, is a good read which held me captive until the last page but then, rather oddly, I felt a bit let down by the whole book; it was not the masterpiece which it had shown signs of becoming along the way. The premise was great: a former exiled Turkish poet returns to Turkey to investigate a series of suicides amongst Muslim girls who have decided to don the headscarf (a bold move in Turkey) in a little snowy town of Kars -where a girl whom he loved at University also happens to live; he gets involved in the local politics too where the Islamic party is poised to win the local elections much to the dismay of the violently secular military...This could have been a brilliant, great, novel but despite many lovely sections and some great writing, it is only a good one--the parts are greater than the sum."
1,I just couldn't take it anymore!,"I choose this book because I was interested in the political aspects of the story. I stuck with it through almost 250 pages because I kept hoping something would happen to make me want to continue to the end. You should know that I consider not finishing a book a personal failure on my part. I always finish a book but I just couldn't stand it anymore. If you read the plot it sounds interesting but when you read the actual events you are left feelng cheated. I think, for me, the main problem is character development. They have no personality. I'm left just not caring what happens to Ka or Ipek. I had to stop because I never felt like reading a book was such a let down and a waste of time."
2,Slow,I attempted to read this book and stopped half way because it was just so slow! The language was difficult to follow and the story did'nt seem to be going anywhere and I lost interest. Overall very boring.
1,Stuck in Snow,"""Snow"" started as promising, but gradually became boring and redundant. The story follows Ka, an alienated Turkish poet returning to his home town of Kars. The same dialogue exchanges are repeated over and over between the modern, Turkish poet and the provincial Turkish fundamentalist moslems of small town Kars. The fundamentalists are idealized as generous and pure of heart. At the point Ka, the protagonist reads his poem named ""Snow"" to a woman and literally asks her six times if she thinks it is beautiful, and six times she responds that it is very beautiful. The alienated intellectual Ka's spiritual quest to get in touch with his cultural and religious identity is agonizingly boring."
2,Not compelling,"I was disappointed with this book and couldn't wait for it to be over. There were a couple of points in the book when I thought, yes, this is really going to be great, but they didn't last long.While I gained some insight into the complex political and social dynamics of the region, I found the story largely dry and confusing. I lost track of who people were and what faction they represented. I thought it was ridiculous that each time Ka felt a poem coming on everyone had to stop in their tracks for him to write it.I was hoping for a historical novel and this is more of a political primer. Perhaps the translation was bad. This is the first book of Pamuk's I have read. I could see that he has the capacity for beautiful prose, but it wasn't consistently represented in this novel.In contrast, I am now reading March by Gwendolyn Brooks. Her weaving of history and politics into a great story with beautiful character development and imagery makes for my kind of book!"
1,Snowed,"Turkey is a favorite place of mine so I was hoping for something insightful and relevant. This book is neither, AND it is boring. The main character was such a chamelion that he was not even needed. He served as an improbable witness to surreal events. You will not find any of the color of Turkish life in this book; none of the complexity of Turkish views and issues. You will be depressed. You will be left wondering where the story was supposed to go and to what purpose.Save your time and money and pass this one up."
2,"After a certain point, it's unreadable","I was disappointed with this novel, although it's possible that some of the fault lies with the translation since the original was written in Turkish. The pacing is uneven, with some portions of the book dragging to the point where I began to long for something -- anything -- to happen. And the motivations of the characters are, at best, murky.I forced myself to read 150 pages, just to be sure that I wasn't giving up too soon due to cultural barriers or some other fault on my part, but in the end I decided my modest amount of recreational reading time is just too precious to spend on Snow."
3,Snow,"It was an interesting book, well written. However it is not on my particular favorite book list. Arrived in good condition."
2,Nobel Prize for Literature??? Amazing!!!,"I found this to be an awful piece of writing. I quit after 50 pages. Maybe it was the translation-but I doubt it. The sentences sprout clauses like weeds and the storytelling turns into a jungle of pretentiousness, artiness, ""poetic"" sensibility etc. I agree with some other reviewers that the characters are flat-in fact, I found everything about this work (the first 50 pages at any rate) third rate. Seriously, what is going on here-is this Nobel Prize winning-writing? I'm amazed."
1,No good for Darda Create-A-Course loops,"I needed replacement cars for my son's Darda Create-A-Course Building System because the original plastic ones fell apart after weeks of highly enthusiastic use by him and every neighbor kid who came in. We had set up an elaborate track with vertical loops. I figured die-cast metal cars would be just the thing. But they flopped off the track at the first rise because they were just too heavy. For our purposes they were a waste of money. In fairness, they hold great fascination for a younger set; the 3-year-old neighbor across the hall off with them and his mother had to run a covert operation to return them as he kept watch from bed. I didn't have the heart to tell her to keep them."
3,Darda cars,"I bought several for a friend who is crazy about his Darda track. These cars are much slower compared to the cars that come with the ""Speedway"" set. They are well made but the car bodies are cast aluminum - originals are tough plastic. Lightweight plastic cars outrun cast metal every time."
5,Darda Car,This was a nice sturdy car. I got this for my grandson for Christmas to add to his darda race track
4,Badge holder w/ lanyard,"I ordered this product back in November 2011. Just got it today 2/29/12. Apparently It got lost in the mail. When I notified the company, they reshipped another one rather timely.When I got the package and opened it, I was initially disappointed with the lightness and flimsiness of the product, however. The functionality of it more than makes up for it. I think it will hold up over time. I plan on buying another one as a backup."
4,Buy this one,"This is the one you want to buy. Adjustable lanyard, pouch holds ID secure it has a center pouch that holds a security card.Plus,a zipper pouch in back for cash. Great product. Just it had loop to change lanyard for a team one."
5,Buy this one!,"If you need an ID pouch in a verticle format, this one is a good choice. It also has a pen holder on the side. Leather is not top quality, but the price is reasonable."
3,"Good Product, Bad Seller","I've been using these for years. Needed a replacement, but they're no longer sold locally in Denver that I could find. Ordered 2 via Amazon, arrived on time & in good condition. BUT--the shipping was 141% of the merchandise price!! 2 items x $2.98 each = $5.96, shipping $14.80! Did not notice this in the checkout process, or I would have immediately canceled.This is absurd & unacceptable. Shipping was simply mailing them to me. This could not be done at a reasonable amount? 141% is ridiculous. Never again."
4,A Rare Find...,"I have been into GW games and Citadel miniatures for nearly 20 years and the company's decision to go to plstic and rather poor resin casting, essentially replacing metal figures, has been a blow to my collections. In order to find and complete the units I have, I needed one of these miniatures and here it is. New in packaging and all the parts. Thanks."
4,Satisfying for now,"I have been a fan of Saint Etienne for a while. ""Interlude,"" is just that - an interlude between ""Sound of Water"" and the next album (hopefully there will be one). This is really a collection of songs that were thrown onto CD singles over the last two or so years. Most of them I have already heard. It is nice to be able to get ""Stevie"" without having to go out and buy that Brian Wilson tribute CD. The remixes on ""Lose That Girl"" and ""Boy is Crying"" are also nice to have since I hadn't been able to find them prior to this. It gets 4 stars from me, primarily because I think Saint Etienne are a great talent and highly underrated (and a good concert too). But since I already have many of the songs, the lack of ""new"" material doesn't rate it a ""5."" This is good for true fans only - it may not be the best one to start with if you're new to Saint Etienne's sound."
5,Amazing,"Svaki put Saint Etienne mi priredi iznenadjenje. Prosto je neverovatno kako su od B strana singlova uspeli da naprave odlican album savrseno uklopljen. Najbolji materijal koji je dosada bend objavio. Od samog pocetka sa instrumentalom Roseneck pa do samog kraja uz pesmu Thank You, bend vam nedozvoljava da se trgnete iz sanjarenja u kojeg su vas strucno uveli. Pesme koje se izdvajaju su: Stevie, Shoot Out The Lights i Mountain Rain.Posle Thank You slede dve bonus pesme t.j remix za Boy Is Crying i Lose That Girl.Obavezno za kolekciju."
1,"I'm a big St Et fan, but.....","oh my god, this album is the WORST one they have ever done. EVER. Even Sound of Water was better than this, and that was pretty much rubbish. B-sides of rubbish is even worse. I'm sorry I wasted money on this CD, seeing how I have all of their other albums and from 1991 to 1998, they were sublime. Perfect. Could do no wrong. This music has no beat, no tune, no melody. It's just DULL. If you like all the rest of their music, you will probably HATE this. A real step in the wrong direction."
5,I love Sophia!,"I have never been disappointed with any of Sophia's tapes. Her voice is so beautiful. Her passion is so intense, and when I really need to get some sleep, she also lulls me into dreamland so quickly. Just very relaxing music, and this is a very peaceful and soulful cd. I love to play this tape for background music as well. She's just the best. Listen to any samples she has, her voice is so beautiful."
4,No Stoppin' Popin',"On some crazy whim I decided to buy this DVD. I woke up one day and thought, ""I wanna learn how to pop"". I ran across this instructional video and I had a lot of fun watching it. Seriously, I haven't had the guts to try it because I'm always afraid a neighbor might see me, or my husband might walk in, but the step by step instructions make it very easy to put together what he's doing when he speeds it up."
2,Disappointing,"This book is more a guide to tracing ancestors in places where Loyalists tended to settle than it is a guide to tracing Loyalists themselves. I was hoping for a detailed discussion of the activities of Loyalists and the measures taken against them and the records that these actions generated. Instead, I found the book consisted largely of a superficial rundown of the typical genealogical records -- birth, marriage, death, probate, land -- that can be found in various Canadian provinces and American states. A true guide to Loyalist records remains to be written."
2,Poor Edit,"This edition of what I had come to find to be one of the best books I have ever read, has proven to be the worst editing I have ever seen. Liberties that the editor took in this edition pale the writer's intentions as I found in earlier manuscripts. I bought this edition as a Christmas present for a friend who was every excited about what I shared with him from my readings of my edition. It was so poorly editied that my friend thought I had given him a different book entirely. Very disapointing - and what is worst is I paid for overnight shipping. I have never encountered a editor's version so different from another - I have learned a valuable & costly lesson. With over night shipping I spent over $30 on this one book - it's not worth 50 cents."
5,BEST CASE FOR IPOD VIDEO!,"i have had a lot of cases for my 30gb ipod, and this one is by far the best. nothing really bad about it."
3,Great protection little usability,"I have an iPod 5G 30GB. The device fits perfectly in the case. However there are two major problems. The opening for the USB cable connect is not aligned properly with the device. This makes it so I have to jiggle the cable to get it in. Also, there is no way to control the device easily if you are doing two things at once. You can't change tracks very easily because the magnet is very strong and keeps it shut very well. (This could also be a plus.)"
3,Could be better,"This is a very nice looking dish rack. I only have 1 complaint about it - the plastic cup holder part tends to fall off if the dish rack gets crowded since it isn't fully attached, it just slips into these notches. Other than that its great."
3,Not as good as it looks online,"When I received this item, it was more flimsy than I expected from a metal product, and the uprights around the perimeter had a cross-bar running through them which prevented putting glassware there. Also, the bottom of the drainer has a series of upright tabs for stacking plates, but many others use a flat-bottom design which is more versatile."
1,dull,"re hashed info commonly known, I cant push this book, maybe its part of a seminar course, I just cannot apply it to my life. GOd is GOD honor Him and HE will Honor YOU"
4,Wonderful synopsis of two-thousand years of science.,"For several semesters I taught a course called ""The Modern Worldview."" I used this book as the primary resource for this course and it was absolutely fabulous. I haven't found a more readable book on the philosophy of science for the non-scientific student."
2,Wooden handle falls out,"While the metal part of this spatula is fine, the wooden part does not stay in. I find that I have to bang the wooden handle in every time I cook with this tool. That is a hassle!"
1,Handle falls off,"16"" Wok Chuan (spatula)This was a gift with a wok, the handle fell off the first time the spatula was used. Wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this item. This is a waste of your money, I will be looking for a one piece spatula so this won't be an option for the next one, in fact I am going to peak into my local asian eatery and look at what they use to stir fry with!"
3,Love the spatula until the handle came off.,"This handle was really nice and big and really handy for my wok. But only after a few months the handle fell off. I will probably end up shoving something into the hole to create a tighter seal and adding some super glue. Other than the handle coming off so soon, it is really a great spatula."
1,Handle came off when I took it out of box,"I hope that this was just an anomaly, but the handle fell off when I took the spatula out of the box."
4,Almost,Almost exaclty what I wanted. Had I taken the time to actually measuer things up I would have realized that this handle is a bit long for standard sized woks (used in a home). It's more for restaurant sized woks. Get the one with the shorter handle. The metal is sturdy and the wooden handle you simply push into the metal handle. Good enough!
5,Great Chuan,Great chuan if you are using a traditional wok. Don't use this on a modern non-stick surface if you want to keep the surface non-stick. It's exactly what I was looking for.
5,Handy and deffinitely sturdy!!!!,This is the handiest tool in wok cooking. It is solid and my wood handle is solid unlike what others have experienced! GREAT!
1,Seriously Lacks Quality,"It's heavy and would have been okay if the wooden handle had not been very loosely attached, and I couldn't twist it to tighten it. The wood was significantly splintered where it was inserted into the stainless steel shaft...maybe because it wobbled back and forth during shipment, but who knows? If this was the condition of the chuan when it left the warehouse, then that's even worse. I won't take another chance, will not be asking for a replacement, and will be returning it for a refund. My advice is that you not put yourself through the hassle in the first place and avoid this product."
4,Worked beautifully,This set worked beautifully to fix a dorrknob that was not opening easily. I sure am glad that I fixed the doorknob I had rather than trying to find a new doorknob to fit the same door.
2,Boring,"I am missing a sense and the spirit in the DVD, it is boring.Look at the body and face of Mr. Milton, he is a bad example for his 3 DVD's.How old is he ? I do not believe in his strength or longevity."
2,TOO LOUD!,"I received this gift after my daughter was born and didn't use it until she developed a cold. When I plugged it in and turned it on LOW (not even the high setting) the motor was so loud that it prevented me from hearing my baby on the monitor. I was not comfortable with the fact that I couldn't hear her coughs, etc. over the sound of the running motor..."
1,TOO LOUD and not child safe,"This humidifier is way too loud. Plus, to regulate the humidity it turns itself on and off. So, the room is quiet and then loud and then quiet and then loud, etc. My toddler could not sleep at all. And, it is easy to take apart. My toddler can take off both chambers (the water holder and the filer/fan part). This seems terribly unsafe (and frustrating as he spreads water all over his room).I would NOT recommend."
4,Love it!,"I have been through 5 humidifiers in the last 2 months. This is the only one that I have found that sufficiently does the job! There is no dampness or residue left after using this humidifer for a length of time because there is no vapor. After buying others like this, that draws dry air in and releases cool and moist air, I was skeptical to spend the money on this one because I found the others not to work well at all! When running this humidifier for the first time, I could actually notice a difference in the humidity level in my daughter's room after running it for about an hour. This did not happen with the others. Yes, it is a loud unit but you get used to it and it does a great job of draining out all of the other noise in the home for my toddler while she is sleeping. I have never had a problem with the filter or finding replacements, nor have I had a problem with my toddler taking it apart. I am very please with this product and will continue to recommend it to others."
5,DEFINETLY A HELPER,After reading the other reviews on this product I felt that I needed to put a positive spin on this product. I registered for this item and received it at my shower. My son is 5 1/2 months old and was severly congested. I took the box out of his closet and set up the machine. After the first night (about 10 hours) he woke up for the first time in 2 weeks able to drink his bottle with out me using saline drops and an aspirator. I am continuing to use this product every night and every morning is much more pleasant. As for the noise level I do not find that to be an issue. I don't have a problem hearing my son cry or even move around on the monitor. I feel the noise is actually soothing for the child and helps fade out other noise in the house. I am glad I got this product and would personally recommended it to anyone. I do understand this product is a little pricey but I believe it is worth every penny!!!!!
2,Cannot find replacement filters,"I like this humidifier alot but now I cannot find replacement filters for it. I only had it for about 3 months and now I cannot find replacement filters. This unit was not cheap either, it did cost money and now for it to basically be brand new and not to be able to find filters is really fustrating. I would not recommend this humidifier for this reason only."
3,A Bit of a let down,"The only reason I give this CD three stars is because there are not really any lyrics except on tracks 2,4 and maybe one other.Besides this the album is industrial chaos. There are some intensly heavy synthetic beats such as 'Musicians are Morons'.I recommend buying this if you dig instrumentals but if you seek lyrics which give meaning to the song buy something by Sister Machine Gun, Ministry or Bozo Porno Circus."
1,too big,My son wears a size 10 (little kids). The medium socks were too big. It would probably fit a size 3 (big kids). It is also rather thin.
2,My son wears a size 12/1 youth...way too big,Purchased for my son who is just getting out of the toddler size. these socks are WAY too big. The size indicates a size 9-2.5 but it should be labled 2.5 and up. we have put away for a couple of years until he grows into them.
5,Smooth and comfortable,Very nice design and easy to use. It is durable and turns on and off with just moving it. Conserves the battery and lasts a long time after being idle.
1,Awful mouse - Had two with the SAME problem,"I love the size of this mouse. This is actually the second one I've had. However, they both ended up with the SAME problem, which is they double click when they aren't supposed to. It's incredibly frustrating. I will certainly not buy a third."
5,Great mouse!,"Purchased one month ago. After unpacking, installing the batteries, and the mouse was working very well. Accurate, auto on/off etc. A few days later installed the software (downloaded from the site), two extra functions became usable: back and forward (e.g. used in explorer), and zoom function. The buttons for back and forward are built that you won't easily touch them by accident, since they are well located and robust. Very nice! Zoom function is almost never used personally..."
5,great product,"I am new to laptops, and missed having my mouse, so I ordered this optic mouse, and like it better than any mouse I have had on desktop computers. If you shut it off after each use, the battery life is pretty good.I would buy another one."
5,great so far,I like this mouse a lot. It does everything it said it would. Make sure you update the software from the Logitech website. The software on the disk is already old and some features (like forward/back buttons in firefox) would not work with the old software. But after installing the software it worked perfectly with just enough customizable features.The forward/back buttons are the best things about the mouse. I also prefer the Logitech scroll wheels over Microsoft and this one didn't let me down. This mouse is smaller than many but much bigger than standard notebook mice so it works great for me. I have had no problems with the wireless reception but I haven't really tested it. I like the purported battery life but it's too soon to judge. Oh and did I mention the mouse is really stylish?
2,Buggy,"I bought this mouse to replace my MS optical wired mouse. I'm currently using Vista. The LX7 is a very small mouse, the length is ok but the width is very narrow. If you are used to a wider standard mouse then this is not one for you. It forces your fingers to curl up for a better grip. I would classify it as an in between laptop/desktop mouse.In regards to functionality, I would have to give it a very low score. It doesn't like any of the mouse pads that I've tried: standard fabric printed, shiny plastic pad or the table. The mouse jumps around and lags. It seems to jump to the top left of my screen a lot, perhaps that's a bug. I also tried moving the bluetooth closer to see if the problem was a signaling issue. I ended up returning it and used my old mouse for now.One thing interesting is that this mouse uses a clear color optic so there's no read light on the bottom. My other optical mice that works on all of my mouse pads use a red optic light. I'm not sure if that had to do with anything."
4,So Far so Good,"I had no real problem installing the LX7 mouse. The controls are smoothand responsive. I don't use it for anything high tech but for basic surfing and ""oldschool pc games"" I had the microsoft wireless mouse 6000 and had a defect with the wheel and had to purchase a new wireless mouse. Size does matter and the LX7 is larger than the microsoft 6000 and more comfortable to operate. It's nothing fancy but a good basicwireless mouse."
4,Cool,This mouse is great. I'd previously tried a Logitech MX-610 lefthanded - nothing but problems. Exchanged it for the LX-7 and am very happy with it.
1,OK but mostly not good,"I bought this model because the Logitech support claimed that it had full feature software support in Win2000. It doesn't!Pros:Good RF performance, no trouble receiving the signal from several feet.Works with both USB and PS2 connections.Cons:Driver does not seem to recognize the mouse, and so there is no way to assign functions to the extra 5 buttons; it only acts like a 2 button scroll mouse.Wheel button is so hard to press that it is useless.Mouse is very heavy and unbalanced.The Logitech drivers are pitiful garbage. I was able to get the wheel button to function using the MS Intellipoint driver, but it is too difficult to press the wheel. Bottom line is it doesn't work as advertised so it gets returned."
2,not impressed,"First off, this mouse is not for people with big hands. If you have average or smallish hands, it should be fine though.The LX7 seems to work well enough, if you have the right kind of surface to mouse around on. It didn't track at all well on my wood grain desk or the keyboard/mouse shelf that sits under it. The cursor would move a tiny bit then stop, making it almost impossible to use. I have never had a problem getting optical mice to work on my desk, until now. It worked well enough with the mouse pad I tested it with, but a good mouse works on a variety of surfaces, not just mouse pads."
5,good mouse,I have had this mouse for several weeks now and have nothing but praise. When I got this mouse my existing mouse's batterys were running low and it wasn't working rite. Put those same batterys in this mouse and worked well for three more weeks. I recomend this mouse.
4,No more accidental button presses!,"Ordered this for my bf, because he was always accidentally hitting the 'back' and 'forward' buttons on his old mouse with his thumb. He can't be the only one that has had this problem!"
4,It works and it's comfortable,"Works great with Windows 7 64 bit. The size is nice and it has a smooth texture, very comfortable. No problems encountered."
5,Solid Buy,"Just bought this mouse because I got tired of using a mouse with a wire and I wanted to not have to keep clicking on the ""back"" or ""forward"" buttons when using the internet. So far this has been a solid buy, very convenient to surf the web, and I recommend it!"
3,Fantastic for a while...,"The LX 7 is a great feeling mouse. However, after about a year of use, the wireless connectivity drops to total chaos. Sometimes my mouse pointer will skip around the screen and click on things even if I'm not touching the mouse. (Is it at all possible my next-door neighbor could be causing this???) There are many frustrations with the fact that the battery compartment became disconnected inside the shell of the mouse, so the batteries occasionally slip around and lose connection. I stuffed a cotton ball under the compartment in order to get the batteries to line up properly..."
3,Great mouse except for middle button,"I got this mouse to replace my older Logitech cordless mosue that had the habit of eating batteries rather quickly. I haven't had this long enough to tell, but Logitech asserts that batteries last much much longer, and I have no reason to doubt that. I also like the forward/back buttons for browser control.However, I will be looking for another mouse. I use Firefox and rely heavily on the Firefox middle-button function that opens a link in a new tab (where the left button opens in the same tab). The middle button (pushing down the roller button) is much harder to press and often misinterpreted as a sideways scroll. One must press down accurately and heavily to get a middle-button click and I seem to miss it about 1 time in 3.In short, if you frequently use the middle-button for browser control, this is not the mouse for you. If you don't, this might be just fine."
2,LX7 mouse useless on any white or glossy surface,"This mouse will not work on any slightly glossy or white surface. Our one office desk is a creamy white, no go, the other is a wood grain glossy finish, no go either. Needs a mousepad like the old ball mice, or a sheet of paper."
3,Good in theory,"I currently own and have owned quite a few Logitech mouse and keyboard products, and know their line very well. i've always had good luck with them from a functionality, compatibility, and reliability standpoint. they typically have a good build, feel solid, have a positive ""click"" that doesn't require too much force, and good weighting.That said, i'm pretty disappointed in this mouse. let me caveat that it *may* just be mine, but the wheel seems to be ""hit or miss"". i am used to having the wheel on my other logitech mice be very responsive for paging up and down. Each wheel ""click"" would move up or down 3 lines of text (default setting). With my LX7, it's not so. sometimes it is correct as above, and sometimes i find myself scrolling and scrolling just it get the page to move, like a car wheel stuck in the sand.hopefully you will have better luck if you buy one, but keep the receipt so you can return it if you have problems..."
5,Cruising w/optics,"I have been very pleased with the performance and ease of operation of the LX7 cordless optical mouse I purchased. It has greatly enhanced the use of my laptop computer & reduced the stress caused with using the touch pad. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to simplify their work on their computer/laptop. For those who do a lot of gaming, you will want to get a more expensive mouse with more features, but for the normal routine computing you can't beat it for the price. Again, as with other products I have purchased at Amazon, I got this item for about half of the list price in most stores or on line."
5,"Logitech is ""good stuff""","Excellent product. Have used Logitech products for a number of years...always top-notch. This is a nice, no-fuss, smallish optical mouse. No plethora of buttons, etc. Sleek, simple, right to the point."
3,Hmm not as expected,"The mouse pointer does not move smoothly in OS X. I know many people (like me) dislike OS X's mouse acceleration curve. After trying all the third party drivers/programs aimed to allow users adjustment, this mouse still didn't behave the way I like it. However, my choice of driver (SteerMouse) works perfectly with the included Mighty Mouse. So for the time being, I'm staying with the wired version."
2,DIDN'T LIKE IT,I found this mouse to be extremely uncomfortable. My hand kept going to sleep no matter how I positioned it on the mouse. I am sending it back.
2,A Real Dissapointment,"It just isn't the Logitech I remember. My old Logitech mouse was in use for years and is still more reliable than my new LX7. The new mouse does work, but after awhile it stops responding so that I can't get any icon to respond. It starts working again when and if I hit restart. I give up. My next mouse will not be a Logitech...and that is a shame."
3,Too slime,"This mouse would be just perfect for its class if it's just a bit wider.. big, its just too slim."
5,Logitech LX7 Wireless Mouse,"I purchashed this product about four months ago and I am very pleased with it. I am still using the original batteries and I do not turn it off when I am not using it. It fits my hand well and the buttons are easy to use. I like the side to side scroll built into the center wheel. Currently I use this with a laptop at home but I am thinking about buying another one for my computer at work. It would work great with AutoCAD for panning, scrolling, and zooming."
2,"Bennie""s Review",Works great. Absolutely worry-free operation with no cords to contend with. Satisfied customer
4,"Just ""okay""","The mouse isn't ""bad"" but I don't like the feel, being entirely used to the smaller Microsoft wireless optical mouses. I do like the added features and the on off function, but don't like that the USB sensor doesn't attach to the mouse when it is not in use for travel purposes. I probably will go with a different mouse next time."
1,Inconsistent,"I have had this mouse for 8 months now. At first, I was quite pleased with its light weight and ergonomic profile, and I found its performance satisfactory. However, over time I have found that there are some days when it is very sluggish in its response. I have tried changing this surface and also repositioning with respect to the wireless receiver; however, nothing has seemed to help.A mouse is useless if it doesn't respond consistently. I am looking for a new one."
4,"good mouse, but too small","The mouse works very well and the price is right. My only complaint is that it is too small and does not fit comfortably in my hand. Instead of my fingers resting on the mouse, they drag on the mouse pad. It is only slightly larger than my notebook mouse and much smaller than my previous desk-top mouse."
3,"Good mouse, doesn't last very long","This is a great mouse that worked perfect for about a year, then I started having problems with the scroll wheel not scrolling, then the left mouse button started getting unresponsive, I was dissappointed at how long it lasted. One of my friends had the same mouse and told me his failed on him too after about a year and a half."
1,GARBAGE!!!!!,"I bought this mouse about a week ago along with a Logitech DiNovo Edge keyboard for my desktop computer. The keyboard is excellent, but this mouse is a piece of junk. It's extremely unpredictable. One minute, its working great, the next its very choppy and inaccurate. I tried multiple fixes, including repositioning the bluetooth receiver closer to the mouse, reinstalling the mouse, hitting the ""connect"" button on the mouse several times, trying a black mousepad, etc, but nothing seemed to work. I bought this mouse specifically because the reviews on Amazon were so good. Usually, you wont go wrong if a product on here has tons of good reviews, but I got the shaft on this one. I'm returning this mouse and buying a Steelseries Ikari Laser instead."
1,I HATE this mouse!,"I bought this LX7 mouse for work. It is so HUGE it makes my wrist ache! It's 1.5"" thick. For the most part it works fine, but a few times a day, it will just not move at all or the buttons won't work. I thought it was the surface I am using it on, so I bought a mouse pad. It still does the same thing. Maybe it's interferring with some other electronic at work? I'm pitching this and getting a Kensington."
5,Best optical,"I have tried lasers and optical. For the money, optical is the way to go. This one is great for left handed people."
3,Fine Entry Level Logitech Mouse,"Ergonomically, I miss my Microsoft Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer 2.0 (just like the Wireless Optical Mouse 5000). It really felt a lot better in my hand.While the back and forward buttons are a lot easier to reach and use here on the Logitech LX 7, they also bother me comfort-wise by always being under my fingers when I hold the mouse. I love that the wireless receiver can work as a small USB stick or a movable desktop antenna, as well as the power button...but those two things seem to be the only advantages to this mouse for me."
5,Best mouse I've ever owned!,"Like the title says, this is the best mouse I have ever owned. It fits the hand well, is responsive, has the extra buttons for Web surfing (and gaming), and has great battery life. I have absolutely no complaints about this product! Highly recommended!"
3,big N bulky,I wanted to buy a mouse for my notebook but this one is big for such purposes. I guess this is more suited for desktops.
4,Great Solo by Lewis,"In this endearing comedy, Lewis plays a youth caught between gangster-type friends and the grown-up world. Mike Damon (McGavin) takes a shining to this delinquent and determines to help him become a star citizen. Sydney enrolls in the police academy which sets off a wide array of antics that disrupts the entire school. The Delicate Delinquent is a charming boy-to-man film. A must have for any Jerry Lewis fan."
5,Best Book I Ever Read,"I liked the book so much because it had a lot of action and some mystery. The 7 Professors started out as friends but one had a sinister plot in mind. Their goal was to build a university in the far north, but then the bad professor burned the buildings down and kidnapped the other professors. Will 3 kids be able to rescue the professors?! Read this book to find out."
1,Better Ones Out There...,"The footage they use can be found on other ""stories"" about her. In most of the old footage, there is no sound to go along with it, and the picture quality is very poor, like some kind of bootleg copy. This isn't really worth buying, in fact I was very disappointed"
2,Mindnumbingly comprehensive,"""It is clear from the evidence presented in this account that the Black Death was almost any disease other than the rat-based bubonic plague whose bacillus was discovered in 1894.""The author starts off well and the premise is fascinating and well supported. No one can claim that the author has not done his homework. However, the catalog of study after study may play well for an academic treatise, it becomes monotonous and mind-numbing for the rest of the world.I can't imagine someone with out an advanced degree and a really keen interest in the research of the black plague finding this book enjoyable. After reading the first five chapters or so I ended up reading the first two pages of each chapter and moving on.Definitely would not recommend this for the lay person. Extremely marginal recommendation even for a scientist unless you are really specialized in this area."
1,Tiny tiny puff,Purchased 3 of these all at once. Mistake. Too tiny to matter and too small to return. Waste of money.
5,Great experimentation,I love this CD...it takes auditory experimentation to a more sophisticated level. It's jazz blend is an example of what the future sound of fusion jazz should be.
4,Short but to the point!,"This book is concise to the point of being terse. It is nevertheless a scholarly account of the development of the classical guitar from the Renaissance to the present day. There are some fascinating extracts and quotations. What makes this book invaluable are the footnotes and bibliography, which enable you to follow up any line of enquiry. Good value."
5,"Beautiful Christmas music, relax and sip the eggnog!",This is a marvelous group of Boston area musicians who have come together and recorded beautiful arrangements of classic Christmas carols. The blending and intonation of this string ensemble is gorgeous!!
1,Mostly By Night----when i'm asleep.,I bought this on a whim. I should have listened to it first.The production sucks and she could have an ok voice for the Lion King.
4,great series! (correction),"... The deadly sins center on Captain Edward X. Delany's life and thinking process out to catch a madman. Spine chilling and hard to put down, very unique characters. a must buy"
1,Really bugging me,This sewing machine will sew okay for a little while and them jam up. It's really frusterating me. took about 1/2 spool of thread to hem one pajam pant leg. I had to stop and start and cut out knots so many times.
1,Cheap Machine,"I'm not an advanced seamstress, but I'm not a beginner either and this machine is truly frustrating! I have the same problems as the other reviewer with jamming, as well as thread breakage and loose, uneven, sloppy stitches. It worked great for the first few projects, then I had intermittent problems and now it is so bad I can't even sew a line without issues. I got this as a gift, but I would recommend saving your money and putting it toward one a little more expensive that's a lot more durable and better quality."
3,Plenty of action but...,"at times its hard to follow. There are too many characters, too many vehicles and too much swapping between sub-plots. This makes it a disjointed read which lacks cohesion & flow as the story is constantly jumping around between different characters & their current situation. I enjoyed reading Flood Tide a while back and this is the first of a new series which is an offshoot from that book. I think I'll go back to reading Cussler's Dirk Pitt books. This book is written by Clive Cussler & Craig Dirgo & I didn't think it was up to the standard of a normal Cussler book which makes me think perhaps Dirgo wrote most of this book."
1,kwikset quality lacking,"I have installed a lot of locks in my day, and have had many problems with Kwikset products. Recently I got this keyed entry from a friend who had it left over, and I figured it was good enough for a closet I wanted to be able to lock. Once again I learned my lesson about Kwikset--With the lock knob (inside the closet) fully turned, you could still open the door by just jiggling the outside knob back and forth for about 30 seconds until it unlocked itself. No keys necessary! This took the cake; usually Kwiksets are just balky and don't work smoothly. Pay $5 or $10 more and get a Schlage. They aren't as good as they used to be, but at least they work."
4,Very cool,"One thing I've noticed about Firefox is how quickly and easily you can learn various things about it. This book furthers your ""Firefox education"" by describing 100 different ""hacks"" (although I'm sure there are lots more out there). These hacks or tips apply to areas like basic Firefox use, Security (some excellent hacks here), Web surfing enhancements, ""power tools,"" and even tips for hacking the chrome (the set of Firefox files most easily changeable) ugly or clean. The hacks range in complexity from beginner to expert, although if you're a novice user, once you get started and gain some confidence, you may want to try some more advanced hacks.I love with how easy Firefox is to use and how quickly pages load when I use it. These hacks seem to be designed with this basic concept in mind. While right now I'm still learning more about this browser, I know in time I'll get the desire to play around with it even more thanks to this book."
4,A must for branding and security,"If you're like me, you've downloaded Firefox to use as your brower then kept promising yourself you were really going to dig into it to find all its secrets. But you never really have time, do you? Firefox Hacks gives you 100 ways to make the most of Firefox. I especially liked the security tips. Everyone should take a few minutes and go through this book's steps on enhancing security. I've also always wanted to know more about chrome and this book gives me 2 chapters on it. If you are going to deploy Firefox with your own branding, perhaps as an internal browser or as a product's help system, then this book is a must. Even if you are only a casual browser user, this book has useful hacks for you."
5,"Must have, no seriously!","This book is great. It's got something for everyone. I've been using Firefox for many many months, and I was learning tons of stuff as I flipped pages. I'm going to be implementing a number of ideas presented in the book. Even the extensions I've been using for months I didn't know all the features build in!This book is well well worth the money!"
5,Great for developers,"Certainly an excellent resource for developers looking to extend Firefox and to create content for the browser. There is some material on the end user side of the browser, adding extensions, working the browser, cool sites to go to. But overall I find that there is more content in here for developers.What's here is very well written and researched. Graphics are used well but not overused, as is the O'Reilly style. As with all of the Hacks books these recipes are teasers and don't offer comprehensive coverage."
5,Excellent,Excellent book if you like electronics and are familiar with freqeucny analysis from say a controls perspective. Having dual concentrations in controls and electronics. I found this book to be very useful. Breakdown of problems aren't really present but you'll just have to design things in stages and combine them. You'll see when you get the book. Highly informative for designing analog filters (including multi order active filters) that could be comparable to some low-mid end dsp filters.
2,Not as good as the original.,"The book has lost a lot, since the previous version by Van Valkenburg (this edition was rewritten after his death). Although there is additional material, the book is no longer enjoyable reading. Important entries are entirely missing from the index. The paper used has a fluorescent glow! This causes eyestrain when reading the book."
2,There is no Matlab exercises,I've received this book this week and I expected much more. There is no Matlab exercises and the Apendices are missing. Could you send me another copy?
4,Good Valance,"This valance is very cute, and I bought it to go with Fisher Price's Ocean Wonders set (which does not have a matching valance). I was able to make this one work."
2,"Very bad deal, poor shipping and product","This Pedometer took 18 days to get here, upon arrival I discovered the FM Tuner didn't work and the directions were very confusing. The quality of the product was very bad. It is not worth $50.00. This is the first time I have been upset about a product from Amazon. I returned the item the sameday . I am worried about a refund from this company."
2,A Waste of Money for me,"Along with other John Milton DVDs, I did not find them worth the money. It seems to give excerpts of his class instructions only and covers very little if you want to learn more than a few movements."
2,Doesn't work when hot!,"I purchased this about a year and a half ago in Tennessee. Shortly after, I moved to Phoenix, AZ. After 2 weeks in the AZ summer, the screen started shaking. The hotter it got, the less I could make out what was on the screen. Eventually, the screen was just a blur. Panasonic wanted me to remove the system, wires and remote included, and send it to some place in Nevada to get worked on. I would then be without a unit for a couple months and would get a new one or my repaired one back.The new 7"" CA-VDC300U should fix this issue. Apparently they didn't fully test the unit to every environment it would be used. It's great for the mid west where it doesn't get much hotter than 80's.Additionally, I would like a unit with a more interesting user interface. This looks worse than a program I made in C++ in junior high."
3,"hippo blanket cool design, not sure about quality","i searched everywhere to find modern baby blankets. i loved these designs by modern basics. unfortunately after just two washings, it's starting to lose its trim. the green stitching is coming loose both on the outline of the hippo, as well as on the outer edge trim. it doesn't seem to be holding up very well"
2,upset about quality,This blanket was way too expensive for what it is. The first time we washed it the stitching came out. Much cutier in the picture than in person. Just poor quality all around.
5,Great book with great pictures,"Purchased this book as present for sailing enthusiasts. They liked it, I am happy :)"
2,Great Toy - - but broke after 10 minutes,"My son loved this toy. It was his 5th birthday and he was so excited. It was something he was able to work all by himself, until it broke! The string broke off and can't be fixed (husband took it apart). We are going to order another only because he is soooo excited about this toy."
1,"SEEMED LIKE A GREAT TOY, BUT IT BROKE ON THE FIRST TRY","UNFORTUNATELY, THE FATHER WAS SHOWING THE SON HOW TO USE THE TOY AND THE STRING BROKE ON THE FIRST PULL. WE CONTACTED THE SUPPLIER [BOUGHT THROUGH AMAZON BUT SUPPLIED BY ANOTHER VENDOR] TWO TIMES AND HAVE YET TO RECEIVE A RESPONSE WHICH HAS BEEN VERY DISAPPOINTING. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NOW . . . . I AM SURE OUR'S IS A RARE CASE, AS IT LOOKS LIKE A VERY FUN TOY WHICH IS WHY WE BOUGHT IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. HOPEFULLY, WE WILL GET A REPLACEMENT FOR OUR GRANDSON. WE LOVE AMAZON AND WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE THEIR PRODUCTS."
4,Todd Rocks!!,"TR's Utopia is a classic. A little drawn out at times but Todd was stretching his wings with this project. Just the beginning of a long ""adventure in Utopia"" This is not your typical prog rocker. Todd Rundgren was taking music to new heights with this record. 2 songs clock in over 10 minutes and a 30 minute epic to top it off. Utopia wasn't ahead of it's time, everyone else was lagging behind!! Utopia somehow fused Rock and Pop and Psychedelic music into a monster of a group. If you didn't like Initiation, this will not please you either. Hopefully someday Todd will ""get myself together"" and put Utopia back in the studio."
3,"Works well, but little bit expensive!",I bought this to use with a special applicator from ROC. ROC didn't sell the scrub cream that was supplied with the applicator anymore so I bought this instead. I am very pleased with this product. I have sensitive skin that turns red easily when the scrub is too harsh but this product leaves my skin soft and not irritated. I am just hesitating to buy this again because I think it is a bit expensive.
3,errr these are fairly thin corners...,If you dont forsee dropping/havn eggheads kick yer speakers/monitors/cabs around then they'll prolly do the job but they ARE thin and they WILL crack up if you get'm tootight or slingem in yer truck/trailer/band-wagon...
3,Dayton Audio PC123-16 Plastic Stacking Corner 16 Pcs,OVERALL A GOOD BUY. ONLY CON IS THAT I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A BETTER PRODUCT DESCRIPTION. SPECIFICALLY THE ACTUAL MEASUREMENTS.
2,Rethinking,Umm not so great i should have brought metal corners for my peaker the plastic is kinda soft and breaks very easy
2,You get what you pay for.,"These require some routering the edges of your project or covering with carpet for a good close fit. While it's to early to state if they will hold up for the long term, for the money, you get what you pay for."
4,Storm is one hot hero...,"with a touch of bad boy and erotic sensuality that makes one hot package. After another lack luster sexual conquest, Storm ( a very talented chef) decides to leave california and head east after reading an ad for a chef wanted at the Coates Inn. Abby Coates (one of the owners of the Inn) hires Storm and thus begins a sexual adventure of awakening and long pent up desires for both Storm and Abby. Although I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to others, I have to say that Abby put me off a bit with her constant need to sample sex with different partners after tasting Heaven with the gorgeous Storm who has fallen for and wants to make a life with her."
5,A great read as well as hot!,"This is the second book of Ms. Holly's which I have read and I thoroughly enjoyed both. As well as writing knock-out erotica, she writes in a way that makes you care about the characters. I hope the Black Lace Press publishes more of her work."
4,Wall-to-wall sex!!!,"Thank God, it had a plot, because the sex alone would have made me want to get my money back. Although the sex was somewhat over-the-top for my taste, especially the chapter where Abby, Horace, Ivan and Peter got together. Jack and Marissa were wild, too. Overrall it was a good book, and I can't wait for the Ms. Holly's new book to be released."
3,Cooking Up a Storm,I thought this book was boring. Not Emma Holly's ususal fare. I will not re-read.
3,Not impressed,Was disappointed in this book. I read All You Can Eat and really enjoyed it but this one really didn't have a full story line to me. It was Ok.
4,All but the end!,"There's actually a plot that you want to follow, and the sex compliments it well. I have to admit though, toward the end it got a bit boring; there was nothing new to hold my attention, and the ending was unsatifactory. Open endings are fine, but this one leaves you with almost nothing, and the epilogue fails to reveal.Up until the last 40 pages, however, I really enjoyed the characters and story line. Storm is fantastic and never loses his dignity or masculinity (as can sometimes happen - it usually makes the story lose all appeal), and Abby is a wonderful opposite. Not as good as some of Holly's other books (i.e. Menage), but still worth the read!"
2,What Romance?!!!,"Is this supposed to be erotic romance?! It is erotic all right, but there is nothing romantic about it...unless you would call it that when two lead characters meeting each other, having a lot of sex with each other, and then saying their I love yous to each other in the end. Oh, but wait, in between the book our female character goes and have more sex with other men and a woman. I would have not pick up this book if the synopsis would have been more detailed. If you prefer erotic romance with characters in monogamous relationships, then read authors such as Lori Foster, Cheryl Holt, and Robin Schone."
2,Not Holly's Best,"I love Emma Holly's books, but I'm having such a problem reading this one because the characters are so one-demensional. I'm used to excellent, intelligent storylines from Ms. Holly and so far I'm not getting even a glimmer of her usual excellent writing.I'd recommend ""All You Can Eat"" over this one."
2,Really run of the mill...,"This is not a great read. Although it's 200+ pages thick, but nothing much happened in this book. It could had been condensed into less than 50 pages without losing any of its plot line."
5,A Warm and Insightful Collection of Poetry,"This book offers a charming and candid view into the sorrows and joys of pet ownership, love and loss. I strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an honest, emotional and witty read. My favorite of all the poems, ""Squirrel Killer,"" put a smile on my face as I thought of my old dog Blackie. It's refreshing to read such a relatable and lovely compilation of poetry."
4,"Poor editing, but a nice story anyway","I wont give the plot here because others have done it in their reviews and there is no need to rehash it. I did enjoy reading this book.I loved it that Terrance had grown up as a neighbor to Sylvain. Included were some sweet childhood stories that gave nice depth, but didn't drag on too long. The characters were well developed with enough personal flaws to keep it interesting. I loved the ending!I would recommend this book if you like your romance books with real characters, mild to moderate mystery, plenty of plot, and mild blush factor (kisses only).4 stars for story, I appreciate a romance that focuses on a good plot rather than the bedroom,2.5 starts for editing which sometimes caused me to have to reread parts to see that a wrong word was used, etc."
1,Very dissapointed,"I preordered this book believing the editorial note ""Scott Hawkins starts where the documentation leaves.."" What a bunch of bs. This book is really bad. I doesn't give anything useful that is not in the excellent WebLogic docs. Don't waste your money in this book. Many issues are cover with WebLogic v6.1. And clearly he used a v7 beta.I'll stick to the WebLogic docs and forums."
5,This Book Rules!,"I haven't actually read this one, but I've read many, many other things the author has written, and they were great, so how bad could it be?"
1,WASTE OF MONEY,THIS JVC IS REALLY BAD.. THE SELLER IS A THIEF. THIS ITEM TURN OFF OF STANDBY AND STAYS OFF UNTIL YOU BRING OUT THE PLUG AND WAIT FOR A WHILE THEN BUT IT BACK THEN IT COMES BACK ON... EVEN SINCE I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AV BEEN DEALING WITH THIS CRAP.. WARRANTY IS CRAP BUT A RIP OFF.. THEY NEVER CHANGE IT. WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME. WILL NEVER BUY BIG ELECTRIC FROM AMAZON OR JVC OR THIS THIEF AGAIN.
5,QUICK -- Buy this Book!,"You'll be glad you did. I sure was! Though it's touted as a ""business"" book, its five vital tenets of SPEED will help you in every facet of your life, from school to home to relationships to self-worth. It's short, it's sweet -- it works!"
5,"A veritable primer of tips, tricks, and techniques","Never Fry Bacon In The Nude And Other Lessons From The Quick & The Dead by business consultant and management trainer Stone Payton is a veritable primer of tips, tricks, and techniques for improving business performance, as well as other aspects of life in general. Focusing on the importance of speed in order to optimize the effectiveness of business processes, sales, adjusting to transitions, and to keep a consistent and successful position in the ""fast lane"", Never Fry Bacon In The Nude clearly outlines key disciplinary strengths with solid point-by-point recommendations and informative checklists which anyone can follow. Never Fry Bacon In The Nude is enjoyable reading and very useful and ""user friendly"" compendium of practical, ""real world"" advice."
2,Wasn't what I was hoping for,"I was hoping to find some solace and answers in this book after the breakup of a narcisistic relationship. I had no idea why this man I had loved so dearly was acting the way he was and discarded me from his life w/o a second thought. I hadn't even heard of narcisistic personalities before I had the misfortune of dating this man. I had to stop reading this book as reading about other people's misfortunes and heartbreaks kept bringing my own pain back to the surface. I was hoping for something that would facilitate the healing process and this book just didn't do it. I'm glad so many other people found peace and answers in this book it just wasn't for me. I wish you all peace, healing, wellness and freedom from the narcisistic people that so cruelly used our generous spirits, devotion and love."
2,Very disappointing!,"I waited with great anticipation for the delivery of this book that received such glowing reviews. 95% was ""soap opera"" material! Please understand that I'm not saying these were not bona fide situations or serious ordeals for those experiencing these relationships. It is just that I expected a lot more out of the book as a real guide to dealing with someone that exhibit these behaviors, though the only way to deal is to realize the person won't change and to leave. Didn't need to shell out $22.00 plus postage to find that out. There are other better written and more useful books available that I discovered when going through the shelves at my local bookstore."
2,Avoid It,"The best thing to be said about this early EMI release is the used price shown above. When I saw it in a bin at a flea-market I grabbed it for one track - You Better Sit Down Kids, as that was one cut I was having trouble finding at the time. Since then, of course, there have been numerous releases covering the work of this talented and beautiful lady on which your money would be better spent.There are no liner notes with the insert - just the same picture front and back."
4,A Must-Read for Canadian Planners,"Worzel offers a unique set of projections, wishes and suggestions as to what will, might or should happen ... along with a strong Canadian viewpoint. You may or may not agree with him on each point but YOU WILL START THINKING ... and that's what he really wants you to do.He has a very fluid style that makes for pleasant reading ... and it's not ""work"". I especially enjoyed the mini-scenarios.I highly recommend this book."
3,Great expectations; But not fulfilled.,"The Tygers of Pan Tang were the best band to come out of the British wave of metal in the early 80's. Their 1st 2 albums were good, but when they got John Sykes on lead guitar they took off. He only stayed for 2 albums, and Tygers kind of faded away. But when I heard of this live release from the John Sykes(Thin Lizzy,Whitesnake and Blue Murder)era, I got excited. But...when I listened to it I was disappointed. John's guitars are way to low in the mix, and the lead singer sounds pretty bad. But this is the only Tygers live cd with Sykes, so it is well worth it."
3,"The band rocks, the singer sucks....","I have been a Tygers fan from the first time I heard Euthanasia on a new music show on an FM station in my area in 1980. I now know what a rarity it was to hear Tygers on US radio, ever. I was excited when I saw this disc at the store and immediately picked it up. It was great to hear the band run through all my favs from ""Spellbound"" and the rest including ""Euthanasia"". The band sounds great, but the vocals are way off key and it bums me out..."
1,Does Not Work,This item does not work at all. If you wet the dart before shooting then it might come out of the barrel and travel 2 or 3 feet. If you don't wet the dart it wont come out of the barrel.
1,does not shoot,"The darts only shoot about 8 feet at best. Darts are flexible material, not even close to the old days."
1,A HUGE Question that I have,"I took this exact model to a TV repair company in St. Louis last year, as the Video ceased to work and the picture was crackley - Not only were they in touch with Daewoo several times, I was too, and we could not get parts for this model TV/VCR Combo. How is it that this is now being sold on Amazon for over $160.00 (on a first come first serve basis and as the model becomes available) when I could not get parts from Daewoo a year ago?"
1,cheap crap,the studs are made of extremly cheap crap. both of them broke while installing. i would not recommend this product
1,Where's the beef?,"When I ordered this book, I was expecting, as in most medically-oriented books, a reasonably well documented work, laying out the most recent research covering the topic, with footnotes leading me to both the sources the author used in writing the book, as well as material for additional research. This book has none of that. There wasn't a hint of the author's background. There wasn't a single footnote. Had I not suffered from RLS for over twenty years, I wouldn't have been able to even guess as to the validity of the material. Fortunately, I have personal experience of most of the conclusions arrived at in the book, and found them to be reasonably accurate, allowing me to infer that the remaining conclusions are also valid.My recommendation: Don't buy this book. Instead, check out the other books on this topic carried by Amazon, which are better documented, and thus more reliable sources."
2,stopping restless legs syndrome,"Gives practical and all-natural ways to stop restless legs.Simple, easy to follow and the suggestions tried actually work!"
2,Wilton Cupcake Tree,"It's awfully cute with nothing in it, but the little holder gizmos aren't situated properly to hold actual cupcakes. The top full tier is particularly bad - 4 holders, but only really has room for three without them all smooshing together. Not pleased. Sending it back and trying a different style from Williams-Sonoma. Or a flat plate."
4,One of those things I did not know I needed!,"A nice way to serve cupcakes and muffins. Sturdy enough to withstand abuse by teenaged boys, and light enough to store easily."
1,Wouldn't stay together,The bottom legs wouldn't stay in the holder and the cupcake supports are too bouncy to hold the cupcakes steady. They kept toppling off!
3,Eh,"I bought this stand for my toddler's 2nd birthday. It was a nice way to display the cupcakes, but it is pretty cheaply made and not very sturdy. A couple of cupcakes fell to the floor from the stand because they couldn't be seated deeply enough in the stand to be secure. I wouldn't buy this item again and won't keep it - it's too rickety to hold on to for future events and would be a pain in the neck to try and store."
3,defective,"Wilton 307-651 Cupcakes ?n More 38-Count 5-Tier Metal Dessert Standbuy from Venezuela Wilton 38 and missed the parts to assemble two connectors and the key to adjust, very sad fu and use can not give you this Christmas I wanted to do my Christmas tree cupcakes"
3,Not totally happy with order,"To be honest, I'm not happy with the order. The stand is great, but going through Amazon and Joann Fabrics was not a great choice and my experience was poor. I was led to believe by Amazon/Joann that there were 8 stands available to be ordered. I ordered and waited and over 1 week later...2 stands arrived with a note/receipt that stated that the amount of stands I needed were not available due to....bla bla bla. I should have been notified immediately if there was an error on the site regarding inventory. These stands were for shower centerpieces. I was panicked and very disappointed. Not professional!"
1,AWFUL!!!!!,"This is the shoddiest thing that Wilton has ever produced. The holder are so close togther that you cannot put the cupcakes in the holder without smashing them together. The cups are not deep enough to hold the cupcakes, and the ones on the 2 upper tiers are too small to hold a cupcake. Also the metal is a cheap small grade that bends too easily. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Wish I could have given it a negative, like - 3 star, rating!"
5,Great customer service from Wilton!,"Although I didn't purchase this stand on Amazon, I felt compelled to write a review on this item. It's actually not so much about the stand -- it's more about Wilton & its great customer service.I bought this stand several weeks ago but made the mistake of not opening the box until about 10 days before my daughter's 1st birthday party. When I opened it, I discovered that some pieces were missing, rendering the stand useless. Great, I thought -- I just wasted my money.Two days ago, on a whim, I decided to email Wilton to see if I could purchase the missing parts separately. I then received a prompt reply offering to send me the missing pieces FREE of charge! Not only that, but they sent them immediately -- I got the parts today! What a fantastic company...And, oh yeah -- the stand is very cute! Can't wait to use it for my daugher's 1st birthday party."
2,Functional but flimsy,This cupcake holder is functional but a bit flimsy. It held both round and square cupcakes and looked pretty on my table. It is rusting after only one use. I think I'd look for something more sturdy if I were using it on a regular basis.
3,Over-priced,"This stand does the job but it's not much to look at. And it's not worth the price.Consider getting a stand that has ""shelves"" instead of individual slots. When they empty, the stand looks awkward."
3,Cupcake stand,"The cupcake stand was cute and worked well, but it was not worth what it cost. Perhaps at $10 less."
2,Too small,Thought this would hold standard cupcakes from a bakery but it will not. It goes together easy but is made for small cupcakes.
4,Cupcake Stand,"This product was great as a center piece. It was sturdy and easy to put together, I would definitely suggest it to others."
3,Cup Cake Stand,It served its purpose. It was a windy day and we were outside and I had to anchor it down.
2,Not the best construction,"The product was pretty flemsy and had a definate lean. Overall it did the job and didn't break, but I didn't think that as I was putting the cupcakes on."
4,The must-have party accessory,"I ordered this cupcake stand for the cupcakes I baked for my son's 1st birthday party. We decided to go with cupcakes because it's much simpler to deal with when you have a bunch of kids to please.I have to say, it was GREAT! It looks very classy and held the cupcakes at a bit of an outward angle to showcase the design on the top. The only downside to the stand is that the second layer (the one that holds 4 cupcakes) is a little tight and the cupcakes are a little smooshed together, but it didn't ruin the frosting or the overall visual effect.A great product. I already have friends who want to borrow it for their kids' parties and I may never go back to cake again!"
3,"works great, but...","So far I've used this once for my son's birthday cupcakes. It looked great and everything was very nice. The cupcakes were held at a slight angle for perfect display. But as I was packing it away, I noticed that the paint was already starting to chip off of it. I guess I'd rather repaint it myself down the road than have to talk to customer service."
3,Missing pieces,"I ordered from Amazon and a connecting rod was missing. I sent it back and got a new one quickly, but the new one also had the same piece missing! I called Wilton and they are sending me a replacement piece. It's nice I get a new piece but please, 2 orders in a row with missing pieces is just unacceptable and wastes my and Amazon's time. I won't be ordering any more Wilton products due to the lack of quality control from their products made in China"
4,Useful Cupcake Display and Holder,This is a fast and easy to use stand for 13 cupcakes. My only problem was keeping it filled...I reccommend a broader base with more cupcake holders around the bottom row.
2,Doesn't Stand Straight,"I bought two of these and they look very pretty, but the cupcake stand is not straight and the tiers slump down. The metal is very light and does not have a solid feel to them and it looks very flimsy. Once, it is filled with cupcakes, this doesn't matter because you are focused on the sweet treats. Overall, for $20 each, I expect more from this product."
5,Love it,I bought this for my son's first birthday party. It worked extremely well and looked great. I kept the box to store it in but it can easily be taken out and stored more compactly.
3,Cupcake Tier 38 count,"We needed a 2nd 38 cupcake tier for a quinceanera event. To find out that when we were assembling the tier at the hall, the top didn't fit. So, eveything looked uneven, there was nothing we could do!!"
4,"Serves It's Purpose, Cute but cheaply made","This product is very cute and you would think that Wilton would have made it sturdy but thats not the case. It's something that was just thrown together. I only paid $29.99 for it, so it was still worth it, if I would have paid more than I would say it wouldn't be worth it."
5,Wilton Cupcakes N' More display,great product. Perfect for my daughter's birthday party and a big hit at the school parties as well. a really neat idea.
3,Surprisingly Disappointed,"I ordered this for my daughters 2nd birthday and ended up not using it for that occasion. The unopened box sat in my pantry for a few months. I threw a baby shower a few weekends ago and set this up a few minutes before the party and was rather disappointed! It's very tiny for 13 cupcakes. Frosting and cupcake were touching each other - especially on the middle tier. Way to ruin a good frosting job. I will use this again and see how I like it. If not, I will be sending it back!"
5,Great for parties!,I am a party coordinator with my own business and WE LOVE these! There are so many ideas you can use this tier cupcake holder for! Excellent and durable!
2,Item I received is not the same item I ordered,"I ordered a Wilton Cupcakes and More Dessert Stand, which is the one in the photo. The one I received is a Home Basics Cupcake Holder. The two items are very similar, but there are differences in the design. I ordered this one to match a smaller stand for a birthday party and now they do not match."
5,*** ANOTHER LOOK AT NAZIS FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE***,"These DVD's are done very well and give you another view of world war II. I have seen many, many DVD's on the war and the Nazis and this is a fresh viewpoint. I was not disappointed and actually was pleasantly surprised that I received so much information for such a low price! I consider this a mostly undiscovered gem of stories. Luckily for me I discovered this box set!"
4,An outstanding recreation of the the 35-year old album,"I believe the album was first recorded in March of `1962 or 63. At the time it featured four outstanding young musicians. Gap Magione on piano and brother Chuck who was only about 15 at the time. An outstanding young tenor saxophonist, Sal Nistico who was only about 22. I had the pleasure of going to high school with Sal and playing piano in our dance band and jazz quartet. Sal went on to star with Woody Herman's New Heard, Count Basie, Tito Fuentes and then a great career in Europe. Unfortunately Sal passed away a few years ago in his early 50's. Roy McCurdy was also a youngster on drums and I was at their gig when Roy got the call to play with the Jazz Messengers. Their talented bass player was Steve Davis. This CD is a collectors item for all all real jazz fans who appreciate following the progress of talented musicians such as these four."
3,I love this series but did you know...,I love CSI! But did you know that you can save yourself $50 if you buy each season seperately rather than buying seasons 1-4 together? At $67.49 per season it only costs $269.96 to purchase by season for all 4 seasons compared to the $310 buying the 1-4 set. Just something to think about.
2,i love this show but...,"yeah, i wouldn't buy this dvd all 4 seasonspack!!! i'm buying the 4 seasons individual, since it will save me about 60 dollars... i love this show, its so amazing, but this whole 4 first season deal is a bust! to you wallet... you can get the ohers for about 250 dollars, and this one is 310.... :) ---> to the 250 deal!"
3,it's okay,I got this as a time waster. The window is not very sturdy and the mirror it come's with can't even be used. The paint they give you with it is also not enought to paint the whole thing. Luckely I have plenty of paint so I used my own. You will have to go out and buy your own stuff to make this project with. However it is cute and it you don't mid spening a little extra you can make it work for you too.
2,Doesn't fit; no adjustments,"Note that this is a behind the head unit: if your head isn't exactly the right size, it is going to slip down right away. It is all plastic, so there is no metal to bend in the band that goes behind your head, meaning you cannot tighten or loosen it at all. To stay on your head, this requires tension, which it doesn't have because it is too flimsy. (Maybe it hooks over somebody's ears, but not mine!)The mic can only swivel--it does not adjust lengthwise at all.Sound quality is just ok.The little control device feels like it is made of plastic about as cheap as the packaging.Good luck carrying this in a laptop case or backpack without breaking it.Complete waste, in my opinion."
3,They hurt after an hour or two,"I dont know if it's the shape of my head or what, but the groove going down the length of the headband from one earphone to the other (carrying the wire) leaves imprints on the back of my ears, making it very bothersome to wear for long periods."
1,Dies fast,Had 2 of these go bad in a couple months. First one side of the headphones will fade in and out and then the mic dies.
3,"Good headphones, BUT.","the headphone part is great BUT, the microphone boom is A: too short and B: not adjustable. Good product if you are maybe 13 years old or less."
5,Logitech Stereo Headset H230,"it has a good sound, clear, easy to use.&#305; know that logitech products are good, &#305; choose this product because of this."
2,"Distant, fading sound quality",I owned the headset for three months and used it only occasionally because of it's poor quality. When I first bought it and plugged it in I found that the sound was far too quiet when speaking into the mic so I had to turn up the software amplifiers which made the sound static-y and unpleasant. Then after three months the sound wore off all together and only static could be heard in recordings.I didn't have any problem with the way it fit on my head and the quality of the speakers were robot-like but not terrible.
1,"This had the potential to be great, but...","This headset would have been great, if it weren't for the backstrap that cut into my ears so badly. This headset is so uncomfortable, I wonder if logitech even tried wearing this before they started selling it. The mike quality is great, and the sound quality from the speakers are pretty average. Do not buy this unless you plan on building up calluses in between your ears."
3,"Sounds good, but constricts a little","Sounds good, but not adjustable as to tension against your ears, and I find it a little too tight after an hour or so. Good value for the money, but I believe there must be better (more expensive) headphones out there."
4,"works great, no usb connector, pins only","there is no USB connector on this headset, only pins. I will try this USB connectorSyba SD-CM-UAUD USB Stereo Audio Adapter, C-Media Chipset, RoHSto see if the headset will work just as well, so that the cords will not stick out the front of my laptop anymore. I further customized the ""personalized color"" donuts by using metallic nailpolish on a set of donuts. ha.FOLLOW_UP: bought thisSyba SD-CM-UAUD USB Stereo Audio Adapter, C-Media Chipset, RoHSand the USB dongle works fine. however be aware the price of the headset + price of the USB dongle is nearly equal to a headset that already comes with the dongle. I guess if the dongle breaks hopefully you can still use the pins."
2,Not worth it spend more and get a better one,I bought this one due to its price and immediately realized that the quality of sound is not that great. ONce you use it everyone around you can hear the voice very clearly. So beware when you talk to someone on chat or something .. ;)
1,Literally does not work with Macs.,"I just bought one of these at Walmart about 45 minutes ago. I was careful to note on the box that it plainly says ""compatible with Mac OS."" So I bought it, brought it home and started setting it up, started voice chatting with a friend to test it out. The headphones worked fine. Not the best quality, but certainly passable. But for the life of me I could not get the mic to work. After about 15 minutes of messing with it, I've determined that the mic is simply incompatible with the Mac OS. The machine doesn't realize that there's anything in the line in, none of my programs will acknowledge that there's an external mic present, nothing. And naturally once I start searching online, all I find is further proof of my discovery: the mic just won't work with Mac OS.So don't buy this if you have a Mac, simple as that."
1,It's so bad thing!,The microphone only work one day after i get this one.Don't buy this product.Very despond Amazon!
3,Headst Review,"This headset is good it terms of sound and ease of useHowever, it is really small and it is not comfortablewhen you place on year head."
5,Excellent product with excellent service from seller !!,"Here is a story about this seller which is the best one I have ever seen. Because of receiving a headset with very minor defect in its cord, I was unhappy and contact seller about this issue. He contacts me quickly and promises me to send a whole new replacement. I got my headset within one week after contacting seller. I enjoy my purchase very much right now and does not waste any bucks of my money for this purchase.In general, I strongly recommend anyone to do business with this top seller!! 100 % positive recommendation"
2,Broken...,"The headset I received only produced sound on one side. Delivery was quick, but what does that matter if the product is defective? I'm only giving this 2 stars because of the fast delivery."
3,Utilitarian,"This headset looks pretty good and works pretty well, but it is a ""cheap"" headset. Also, they are very uncomfortable on the ears. I cannot wear them for more than an hour at a time."
3,Great quality of sound both ways.,"This product is what is expected of Logitech, Works like a charm. Great quality of sound incoming and outgoing. The only problem that I personally have with it is the length of the microphone, which should at least be adjustable lengthwise. I cannot talk loudly enough in a quiet environment in order to be heard.Another small thing would be that the speaker and microphone jacks should be labeled clearer, but it is a small issue, that takes 2 seconds more to figure out where to plug in what."
3,Worth the money,"It is just worth the money spent. Its been a month and I have not faced any problem so far. The only disadvantage is the comfort-level. Can wear it for an hour or 2 , but later it starts pinching on your ears. It actually have a comparatively smaller ear still I feel the pinching. If comfort-level is the MOST IMPORTANT aspect you are looking at then I wont recommend this product, else this product is awesome."
4,Good price and works fine,I have not had any issues with the headset but for me it was all about the price. I have had them for about 2 months and haven't had any issues so far.
2,"Not made to last, but good while it does.","Pros:+ Comfortable. Fits snugly around the ears, but not so tight it would bother you. Can be worn on a normal sized head (I hope my head is normal sized...) for long periods of time.+ Cheap.+ Long cord (8-9 feet ish?)+ In-line control for muting the mic/adjusting the volume.+ Microphone quality is great!Cons:- Left headphone loses sound periodically unless the wire is held JUST SO and I don't move. (aka it doesn't work ever.) This happened after under four months of heavy use.- Behind-the-head design is uncomfortable if you want to recline or lie back.- Microphone can swivel up and down, but not closer to or farther from your mouth.Verdict:This headset is fine if you don't need to use it very often, but if you use it daily it's just not going to hold up. Spend more and get one that lasts so you don't have to be exasperated and angry at life in a few months' time."
3,Headset good with improvements,"The headset works great, sounds good etc. The mic is in a poor location for me. In addition the band connecting the 2 ear pieces is not very comfortable. The sound quality both and pick up are good for gaming as well as VOIP calling. If there was a 3.5 that is where it is, I had a Plantronics before that fit better but he mic was not as good. For this price range this is a good product and would recommend it. The 2 connector setup works well for my computer but I think this also limits the available options."
1,doesn't work - terrible product,"I purchased this product and had it used it 10 times at most to make short phone calls via google voice. Microphone stopped working at that point. I returned it and exchanged it for a new pair. It worked once and then mic failed again. I had purchased it at Best Buy and when I went in the first time, the associate told me she had bought the exact same model and the mic never worked her not even once. Terrible product! Do not purchase! I will mention that when it worked, quality was great. But I would not purchase it never knowing when the mic will give out."
4,goods worth their money,The logitech headset was worth the money. there are no issues about the voice quality on either side. both the microphone and the speakers are performing well. the plastic body of the headset is hardy enough to be twisted and turned as one might have it when lying on a pillow. all in all is was a good purchase for me. Though it could have been more comfortable with a smaller headset size but then it would cost more.
2,Great!...if you enjoy headaches.,"They may work well, but the thick plastic wedged between your ear and skullquickly becomes unbearable... Four stars for the mic, three for the sound, and .5 stars for the ""comfort"". Buy something else."
1,No customer support for inoperative headset,Logitech headset/microphone combo seems to have a real hard time working even with XP. Everything is Microsoft's problem in the words of their tech support. Even when the head set will not work with 3 different computers all of which are up-to-date.
2,You get what you pay for,"This item is not as good a deal as it looks. It's poorly made, and the mic is horrible. It's tiny, and doesn't reach my mouth at all. Even when I put the mic input volume to the maximum, I have to either yell or physically hold the mic with my hand near my head in order for the other person to hear me. It would be fine for a younger person, but it does not comfortably fit an adult.It also has a very unpleasant plastic odor to it.I do not recommend that anyone buy this product."
4,Good inexpensive set,"Recently my headset of some years had broken, and so I went through the journey of finding a replacement set and I'm glad to say that it ended here. Now, I'm not an audiophile, what I needed was a microphone good enough to transmit my voice clearly and some headphones that could play some decent sound through them, and for that purpose these do great. They feel very durable, the headset as a whole produces and transmits clear sound, and they're very cheap at only $10! All in all, I'm really happy with it."
2,Ergonomically bad,I have brought this headset 1 week back. I was excited with the sleek design and volume control addon. But I must tell you this does not fit or adjust well around your ears. Its so rigid that even your ears starts paining at times. I suppose i have to keep stretching it daily so that it comforts me.I would suggest a more bigger headset coz you would like to have a good headphone which you are comfortable with. A big no for those who wants good ergonomically designed headset
1,Doesn't last long...,"I bought one of these and had no trouble for about 3 months. After that, the left speaker started going out. A couple weeks later, the right one started going out too. The only way I could hear out of them is if I kept holding it at awkward positions. I decided to go ahead and get another one and figured it'd be better. The exact same thing happened. So far I've used 3 headsets from Logitech and none of them have lasted very long. Save your money and get a decent pair from a different company."
2,Not worth it,The microphone produced loud static which makes it useless for gaming. The speakers on the headset did not work at all. Not even a good paperweight at this point.
1,Awful.,"This product did not work from the start. The headset is incredibly small and flimsy. I was very disappointed with this purchase and the quality, not even worth it at this price. Do not buy this."
3,Note to those of you with big heads (like me),"I bought this headset about a week ago. They look nice and the sound quality is great. The only issue i had was with me...and my big head. They pull on my ears so much that it turns them red after a short time. So to those of you with big heads i recommend buying something else. Other than that, the microphone, sound quality and look was great."
1,Bogus- not new **DO NOT BUY**,"I'm a big fan of the H230 and was looking to purchase a few more. These units were labeled new but came in an unsealed bag, obviously used (by the hair attached to the ear pads) and in general disarray. Heading back to Amazon now, huge ripoff!"
3,clearchat colored overear headset,"Headset is good for chatting, not great for gaming, cuts out sometimes. But that was not its intended use, so it works well for what its supposed to do. Color changes are irrelevant, and over ear style is a bit uncomfortable long term. Otherwise the rotating mic is convenient, and I am overall happy with the purchase/ value for the money.*EDIT* mic stopped working after less than 1 year of casual use. Headphones still playback though."
2,Poor product description.,I was looking for a headset to plug into my Cisco IP phone. Since I like the Logitech brand I decided to give this headset a try. I studied the specifications carefully since there are so many variations on the market. I also viewed the product illustration (picture). Based on the description and picture I was led to believe that the headset could be plugged into a telephone. When I received the headset I discovered that it was designed to plug into a PC's speaker and mic port. Needless to say - it would not work for me. I strongly suggest that they show the connector type as part of the illustration to avoid people like me from purchasing the wrong product.
2,dont try it,"This item is not comfortable to use, the sound quality is too low to listen to music, the mic quality is average."
3,comfortable but a little flimsy,"this headset fits nicely and is comfortable for extended wear. it seems a bit flimsy though. already had a little issue with sound in one earpiece. overall i think it is good for the money, but much better out there for a few bucks more."
2,not so awesome,while it worked for 2 months after i bought it it eventually started going out. after 2 months! during those 2 month i admit i was in love. no longer. now it constantly goes out in one side unless i hold my head at jsut the right angle
4,Headset,"I bought this for my girlfriend. The headset itself took a while for her to get it fitting so that it was comfortable. But once she did there wasn't a problem. The sound quality is pretty good. We are having this problem of random noise, but I believe that it's because the connection is bad."
2,"5 months, then broke","Cons: Lasted me 5 months before dying completely. I keep my peripherals in supreme condition (Computer built in 2008 still running strong in 2011), but these headsets are really fragile and seem to have a really limited running time. The sound is decent, but the buds don't cover your entire ear so noise does get in. The headband is really flimsy so be careful when handling it.Pros: The volume control on the wire is very convenient and the mic isn't too bad, though if you're using Mumble, ventrilo or skype your friends and teammates will notice background noise when you speak and sometimes you won't be able to hear others talking if your mic is on. I guess the quality is poor.Conclusion: If you're on a budget then these headsets are okay, but invest $30 more and you could get a Siberia V2, which I'm using right now."
1,Not sure if its worth it.,"I had thought that this headset would be a good one to get because it was cheap, but I found out that when they say cheap they mean it. The sound quality was good until around two weeks. The first one I got I just moves my head and the speaker snapped right off. The next one I bought a wire came lose inside the cord going to the speaker. Not sure if this would be a product I would ever recommend for use. The other bad thing about them is that they don't stay in the jacks for nothing. I move away from my laptop a little and they just pop right out of the jacks. Not the greatest product from Logitech."
4,Loving Logitech,"Although they tend to give me a headache if I'm not wearing them exactly right, they have awesome sound and are comfortable (if I'm wearing them correctly).... I've always been a fan of Logitech and will continue to use the headphones in the near future."
3,a little more info,"According to Amazon's customer service (great people, very helpful, especially after Bandai couldn't answer) the box only fits one DVD - it is not for the entire set.Bandai finally bothered to reply - they say the box is for the entire set. I choose not to care anymore. I'm buying the individual DVDs and making my own box. phooey"
2,Surprising features,"I didn't expect that this dish drainer only has 3 sides. They claim that this is so that I can put pans in it. I always put pans in a dish drainer with 4 sides. This is over-engineered and non-functional. I also didn't see that Cashmere apparently refers to the color, which is black. I will be returning it."
5,Nice...,A good size for a kitchen for 2 people. Not too big and not so small it's useless. The glass/cup holder in the front comes off too easily but I fixed that with some Gorilla Glue and it wouldn't come off now in a nuclear explosion.
3,Good one,"If u don't want a drainer that will last with you for years & years, & if u have limited space on your counter & want a drainer that isn't bulky but take loads of stuff at the same time. than this is it.Its a good one, i bought one a year ago, & few months ago, i started seeing mold & it got rusty & no matter how much i scrubbed & how many times i put it in the dish washer, it wouldnt come out. its done.so i had to replace it. i looked for all the other drainers, & at the end, i got that one again.becuz of the size, its pretty compact but takes a loooot. also, it has place for cups, which not much drainers have.& of course a cup for forks & spoons.For the price i was expecting it to come with the draining board, but it didn't, u have to buy separately, (around $11)"
4,entertaining saga of a sea-captain at odds with the Romans,"A captain beyond compare, a second mate whose loyalty is beyond reproach, a love interest who is the exiled sister of Cleopatra, and a ship, ""Liafail"", that carries them all toward the ends of the Roman world."
2,Kevlar? Doubtful,"Kevlar is highly resistant to fire. This stuff burns instantly to ash, making it useless for fire performers. I don't believe this is real Kevlar at all and I'm very disappointed in my purchase."
3,Kevlar thread,"Description did not mention length of thread. Another review stated 60 yards, which makes this rather expensive. It seems rather thin, but ok otherwise."
4,Mind meets language philosophy,"The Philosophy of Mind meets the Philosophy of Language. This is a well presented book, rare in that it summarises the concepts of the topic without presenting a history of dead, superceded ideas or sycophantically agreeing with named philosophers or arguing against particular disliked authors. The ""mind in a vat"" concept is expanded into various graduated versions; the presentation is well argued, unlike the narrative ramblings of many contemporaries. It is clear and convincing due to Garrett's style. The scope is well defined but could have been extended, so check carefully what you expect in the introduction. Useful to graduates and advanced readers, may be useful to beginners."
1,I should have read the box closely.,"On the cover it said with 4.0 software for Windows. I bought it not looking at the back where it says Windows 2000/XP. Waste of my money since I have not had a XP system around almost a year. Please Folks upgrade this. Seems like a fantastic product, but as it is, it is just some fancy blank labels, with worthless software."
4,Windows7 upgrade now available!,"Just a quick FYI - if you go directly to Smead's website (smead.com) & go to the ""contact us"" section, you can get an upgrade for Windows 7 emailed to you. I just did this using their webchat option and took maybe one or two minutes.So for those W7 users out there unable to use this groovy little product, now you can! PS: the upgrade is free."
1,Won't work on your Mac,I bought this software a year ago when we had a Dell. With Dell having all its problems we switched to Macintosh. I wanted to add a few labels to my files - it would not run on our iMac. Smeade support says they don't support Mac. Back to the drawing board......
5,"""Please Dear,"" where have you been all my life","""Please Dear, Not Tonight"" rivals ""Our Bodies, Ourselves"" for providing thorough, no-nonsense, but far-from-aseptic sexual information. I see it competing with ""The Feminine Mystique"" for the number of women it will nudge to ""take on"" their perceptions of the way their sex lives and relationships have always been, continue to be, and the way they want them to be. A valuable and timely book."
4,61 and still learning!,"Having grown up in the straight and narrow, family wise, religion, culture, etc., I have to admit I'm an uptight prude wanting to 'fly'. Well, Mary Jo's book has set me on my way! It was like getting permission to loosen up. This book is well written,very educational, and fun to read."
5,Deadspeak,"I have read Necroscope, Vamphyri, The Lost Years Vol. 1, Resurgence: The Lost Years Vol. 2, The Source, and I am just finishing Deadspeak. This is the best series on Vampires I have read, in my life. These books are so much better than the Anne Rice series. There is none of the ""woe is me, I am a lonely creature of the night"" B. S. Lumley's Vampires would stake an Anne Rice vamp, chop off its head, pour gasoline all over it, light a match and [...] on the remaining embers. Finally, we have some blood-sucking, evil creatures of the night that would put most trial lawyers to shame. The mixture of Ludlum-esque espionage and Stephen King vamps on PCP and LSD is great."
5,beautiful,"I believe this was a ""Lenten Gift"" for me. The information is wonderful. It takes much time and thought to read it but it is a powerful guide to (and from) the Lord."
4,for school,"No pictures in the book, but since its for school i have no complaints. its very big, and pretty useful for my class, not much to say about it."
2,Hard to Take,"I find these vitamins really difficult to swallow. The pills are very large, and they are uncoated, so they stick in your throat. I actually gave my bottle away because I felt like I was choking on them."
2,yuck,"By looking at the nutrition label, I figured this was one of the best affordable multi-vitamins around. When it arrived though, my thoughts changed. The pills smell awful, and by awful I mean absolutely disgusting! They are speckled with various brown and red coloring, and taste even worst then they smell. I was convinced they sent me a bottle that expired 10 years ago. I plan on finishing the bottle, but I usually cut them in half (because when tested with vinegar, they did not dissolve). I have never hated taking my vitamins this much!"
2,Get Help Elsewhere,"This solutions manual is pretty much a waste of money (just like the textbook this is used for). For some reason, it answers every OTHER odd number. Basically answering problems 1, 5, 9, and so on. Other times, it actually skips some of those numbers!The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is the fact that the problems the solution's manual does answer actually did help a little. Unfortunaly, it can be wrong once in a while, as my teacher can contest.Don't waste your money on this unless you can find it for at most, a third of the price. Even then, the frustration probably still isn't worth it."
2,solutions for calculus,"Like many of these solutions manuals, it only gives answers for a select few problems. The solutions are pretty good but there are only a few for each chapter."
4,Good enough for me...,"This is a basic hoak that does what it's supposed to do. I guess the only negative is that the wooden handle does not stay in the metal shaft. I banged it in there pretty good, but it does get loose once in a while...usually while I'm cooking with it."
1,Didn't even get it.,"I had ordered this item, but they at first sent the equivalent chuan (spatula), which they let me keep for $5. That was okay because I had planned to get it anyway and couldn't have gotten it for that price anywhere. Then, I contacted them and they sent a hoak. It was twice the size, and for me unusable. So i contacted them again. They sent another. It was the same size, minus an inch and a half length, so still unusable. This company has NEVER gotten a SINGLE order I have placed with them correct on the first try. This one took three tries, and I have had to ask for a refund, which I will be taking to another store to get the one I want, That and the Money from selling the two incorrect ones to my local oriental market. I guess there is a reason they have the lowest prices on the internet. That reason? NO QUALITY ASSURANCE. Do not buy this if you want to get it in a timely fashion."
3,This book seems very elementary.,"I was disappointed in this book because I expected more from a Cadence Magazine author. This book is probably great for someone just starting out in AutoCAD, but for someone who's done AutoCAD since R10, I can't find a thing I don't already know within these pages."
3,Strong but heavy,"This is a powerful stick, it does the job of casting and reeling in heavy fish, but the problem is that it is heavy and you won't be able to hold it while waiting for a fish to hit the line. This is better for boat fishing than shore fishing in which you want a lighter rod for movement and handling. This rod is very strong and stylish."
2,Did Not Receive Complete Order !,"What i receive is fine, but i only got one battery ,should have gotten two. order was placed April 26,2010"
3,Amazon Verified Purchase,"Seller was good, product was fair at best. I purchased this for a punctured tire on my bike and it seemed to have worked for less than 30 miles. Anyway, it served a purpose to keep me riding till the weekend when I took the bike in to be repaired. I would recommend the product ONLY as a last resort and if you know you have a short distance to go before replacing your damaged tire."
5,High Energy RockNRoll...,"Fifteen (15) high energy guitar driven tracks that really rocks. All first class acts with their original hits.We have Led Zeppelin, Bad Company, Rod Stewart, John Mellencamp, Tom Petty, Wings, Doobie Brothers, Traffic, Moody Blues, Bruse Spingsteen, Bryan Adams, Rainbow, The Who, Jethro Tull and Sammy Hager.Very nice addition to your collect.enjoy"
3,"Good, yet sometimes verbose","Good for reflective purposes, yet, some prayers seemed very repetitive. I'm not Catholic so I was leery of the ""Mary"" section. Pleasantly surprised to find only 3 prayers were directed towards her. The other 3 were God-centered. Buenos para su devocional personal."
5,Great price,I remember when these optical cords were $100. This cord will give you perfect Dolby Digital and DTS.
5,"Lonesome Dave's Purpose Statement...""Road Fever""","Other than ""Fool For The City,"" this may be Foghat's finest all-around album. The true gem here is ""Road Fever,"" with a classic and unrestrained Lonesome Dave performance on ""Road Fever""...""I'm back on the road and I ain't gonna stop, gonna roll till I'm old, gonna rock till I drop..."" He DID, folks! Right up until the moment that cancer took him and he couldn't physically meet the challenge, Lonesome Dave used his gift. Just like Luther Allison and Albert Collins and precious few others who gave everything they had, right up to the end. This is a solid, joyful, rocking CD. Get it."
5,Adrogeny is love,"This book is absolutely brilliant. From the begining to the end your left with one question....So is she a she or not? The writing is...funny, sometimes cynical, but always deep. I would definantly reccamend this."
3,V Tech Shrek the third,"My granddaughter has several of the V.smile cartridges and this is the most difficult as far as user input. Controlling the direction that you want the character to move is nigh on to impossible!! As soon as you think you know what the game is using for directions(forward, backward, etc.)it will change. It is VERY frustrating for adults as well as the children it is supposed to be created for. There seems to be good educational value here if it could just be accessed.I would recommend Dora, The Backyardigans, & The Little Mermaid as better alternitives."
3,Ok but not great,"As far as learning is it not worth the investment. Its short and not well designed... overall a quick 30 mins not really worth the money... I had hoped for something better, my son enjoys it for entertainment value but as an educational game it fails."
3,OK game,Game has places where it seems to either not be working - or it is impossible to continue. Other than those couple of spots - the game is entertaining for the kids.
5,AWESOME,"I was fortunate enough to view this DVD by ordering it aboard (it should play on most computers). You won't be disappointed. They did play in chicago a few years back, and they still keep getting better and better!"
4,Good ideas,"Most are good ideas for various ages. Some ideas are close to being duplicates and some aren't much at all; I think they pushed it a little to get 365. But overall, the book is worth it for the good ideas."
3,"Useless for anybody past ""beginner"" stage","I have been learning Japanese for a number of years, and this is the second Japanese/English dictionary I had bought. It worked fine at the beginning, but as I got into reading more complicated texts, the faults became more and more visible.There is just not enough vocabulary in this book. At times I would have to switch back and forth between the two dictionaries I owned, hoping one of them would carry the word I was looking for. Kodansha's dictionary is a huge disappointment; the quality of it otherwise is very nice. The cover is gorgeous and the semi-hard cover makes it durable yet still flexible. The entries that ARE in the dictionary come with a number of examples on how to use the words, and that is always helpful when attempting to write something. However, as I use the dictionary to look up words I don't know yet, it becomes ultimately useless."
4,A Nasty Kind of Humor,Rod Carrington is perfect for laughs if you have both a nasty sense of humor and an appreciation for southwestern country humor. This CD has a good combination of improvisational humor as well as country music humor. Not for the fainthearted!
2,Doesn't Work On Speedo Optical Goggles,"I purchased this product to use on my Speedo Vanquisher Optical swim goggles, which provide good vision correction but have a terrible anti-fog coating. After only a couple weeks of use, the longest I could swim without these goggles fogging up was 15 to 20 minutes. After trying saliva and baby shampoo, I decided to try Sea Vision, but repeated applications failed to improve the fogging at all. I'm giving a rating of two stars instead of one because the goggle material may be partly to blame. -- Art Dragon, author ""Journey to Fitness"""
4,I Am David,This DVD is an excellent story of a young boy in a Concentration Camp. His escape was miraculous. The portrayal of his saga was so well done and I would recommend it very highly.
5,one of the best movies of all time!,This is a great movie with an incredible story line that will melt your heart. One of the best movies I have ever purchased!
4,Very fine film exposing some of what Alexsander Solyzenitsyn talked about vis-a-vis Soviet Concentration camps,"Viewers will recognize the name JamesCazeveil from Mel Gibson's 'The Passionof the Christ' movie. Story of 1952 escapeof Bulgarian boy from Soviet Concentrationcamp, who takes sealed letter, loaf of breadand makes his way across free Europe to Den-mark. Powerful for once non-jewish Concen-tration camp story. Amen for that! Good per-formances all around. Four stars out of Amazon'sFive scale."
4,I Am David DVD Review (Australia),"We have a problem with our DVD players reading the DVD format (obviously American/other region format) - the message we're getting is ""Not Compatible"", however, I believe there is a very long, painful process they can go through in order to watch it - Is there another format that can be forwarded to us?? (we can return the one which we received) - your feedback would be much appreciated."
1,what a junk!,this is a unbelievably boring and moronic movie. highly impossible and totally unimportant to write a review. a lousy movie.
5,Astonishing,"I just watched I am David and I loved it! This is a movie that is so full of the human spirit that you can't help but cry and be moved. This is a movie that didn't need gratuitous sex scenes, foul language and endless violence to make it amazing, just raw human emotion about a young boy who is trying to find life, and what else it has to offer than all he's know in the camp. I recommend this movie to anyone who want to watch a movie with their entire family!"
5,"An authentic ""tear jerker"" from start to finish.","It is an authentic ""tear jerker"" from start to finish. Masterful. Fast moving.The old lady in Switzerland and Jim Caviezel's character deserve an Academy Award for best human beings.The kid played the part impeccably, except for the distinctly British accent which sort of upsets me every year around April 19th!"
4,"Not perfect, but still so wonderful","Wolves, Wolves, Wolves! I love wolves! They are one of my favorite animals! They are awesome and good looking, and their howls really light up my day(and night!)And boy, if anything was ever meant to be a canine, it was the wolf. Anyway, this book was great overall and I enjoyed it quite a lot. The photos rocked and the information was out of this world. It could've used more than just the four big seasons where wolves do different things, though. Whatever. It was a terrific book, and I like it a lot. This is a must have for any wolf lover. Or any carnivore lover. Okay, I'll be blunt. This is a must-have for people who like cool stuff as well as animals. Period."
1,disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. While all of the photos are of dachshunds, not all of the information is strictly related to dachshunds. Many of the chapters were generic.I was expecting more help from this purchase.I wouldn't recommend it."
3,This bag needs more beans,"Knowing I could not use a tripod for long shots from a Land Cruiser, I opted for this beanbag. Small and light, it is a good travel partner, but the bag is not firm enough to be suitable for ordinary conditions. It's great when placed on a broad, flat surface, but that can be a luxury in the Serengeti.I had to drape it over a 1-1/2 inch rail for use, and most of the beans fell to one side or the other, leaving a small quantity to steady the camera -- not so good. For some really long shots (44x), I borrowed the guide's stiffer bean bag.I'm not a bean counter, but another forty or so beans would give this bag the heft it needs to be useful in more situations. To get there, I'll buy some dry beans and let my wife do the surgery."
3,Adorama Bean Bag too thin,"The use of a bean bag in stabilizing a camera requires that the camera nestle into the bag. If the bag is too thin it does not cradle the lens and camera safely enough. This is especially true for a long telephoto lens. It is not that it is of no value, but it is disappointing and should have been better."
4,Hail to theRedskins,Wait until next year! Son is displaying this proudly on hid vehicle. Pretty sure we will be happier fan next year.
5,sturdier and better than OEM,"These were great, they pressed in easily and seem more robust than the oem part (discounting the fact that they were worn out)."
5,Aptly named- a well done recap of mankind's greatest achievement,"This book is a smash hit. You need some familiarity with basic science and mathematical concepts. The book gives one a sense of awe at man's struggle to understand the physical world and the achievement these equations represent. Such a great idea it's a wonder it hasn't been done before. I enjoyed every page. It had been a long time since I discovered and thought about these ""icons"" during undergraduate studies."
3,Very interesting but it is not able to describe widely the completely physics long path,"The book describes in a reasonable way the main ideas from the physics equations giving interesting highlighs of each. It is a lean book, pleasant and very attractive; which make it easy and quick to be read. Based on the fact that the physics history and the main equations basis are not so evident and easy to be understood the book does not cover physics in a wider manner. Certainly to have a better understanding other books are needed."
2,Famous equations of physics,"The book does not go into any details about the equations. I was disappointed in it. Think of it as a ""picture book"" rather than providing any discussion."
3,"OK, but...","What happend to ""Put a Little Love in Your Heart""? Damn it! Don't they always find a way to screw up these anthologies?"
4,Very detailed figure,"This deinosuchus looks very good in detail, way more realistic than its discontinued Schleich equivalent, albeit smaller. Its as accurate as it can be, since only the skull and other parts of the skeleton have been found. Now, if only Carnegie would produce a Sarcosuchus replica..."
5,Easy view tabs--very helpful,"These labels are great. They are viewable from three sides. Specifically, it makes your files easy to see from the top. The software that comes with theViewables Labeling System Starter Kit(not with this label refill pack) gives you several options: tab color, index letter, number of lines on the label, file folder tab label, three sided Viewables tab label, etc. The software also keeps track of which labels are printed, so the next time you go to print some, it remembers which labels on the sheet have been used. I give this five stars because I have no complaints about the product."
4,Label Refills,Product arrived in the condition and of a quality that I expected. It would be nice to be able to order replacement printables withouth having to order the whole pack including the plastic inserts.
3,Great viewing BUT...,"These labels are great for being able to clearly view the file names that you are using. But, don't think that this process of getting the labeling done is an easy one. It seems hard to line up the label on the plastic tab and you can not adjust after seeing that it isn't going on correctly. Which makes it a messy process or at least a wasteful process if you have to reprint the label to ensure a good fit. So, it is nice to be able to view the 3d tag but not great for saving on cost when you have to redo the labels in order to keep the files neat looking. I wish they would have figured a better label that had a clear system for lining up the tabs so that you wouldn't waste so much time."
4,Detailed Photos,"Admiring the black and white photos in Sagay's book is a delight. The hair styles are exotic and complex. She describes two different techniques, cornrowing and hair threading, with enough clarity and step by step photos that it is possible for a beginner to achieve one of the styles. There are also many outragously time-consuming examples that would challenge the most proficient hair stylist to reach new heights of difficulty. Sheer, outrageous fantasy is the only way to describe some of the hair styles, but they are still fun to see. Sagay gives a fair amount of historical background to show where and when the hairstyles originated. I was fascinated to discover that some of the hairdressing ingredients used in Africa were oil, charcoal and clay. The faces of the women and girls in the book are serene, joyful and proud. I wish that the book was updated to show current styles and that some of the photos were in color."
2,Not what I expected,This book was ok. I was hoping that the part where it said styles of today was really styles of today. I could have spent my money on another book worth $40. Great for a coffee table book not for a reference for styling.
4,nice tools,"I've used all the tools in the package and all work well. Great balance on the drill/driver, nice power on the recip, decent circular saw, flashlight is ok, but note that it's general florescent light rather than a beam. One of the 2 included refurb batteries was a little beat up and seems to hold less charge than the other. Otherwise happy with this refurb purchase (at < 1/2 the Home Depot price)."
1,Do not purchase this product!!! These tools are junk!!!,"Do not purchase this product!!! These tools are junk, the batteries are junk, fried right out of the box."
3,WILDLIFE IMAGERY BOOSTS FILM'S EFFECTIVENESS,"Although this production, filmed on location in South Africa prior to its fall into misrule, periodically segues into a faunalogue, there is yet a great deal of substance to be found in the screenplay of Chris Dresser to sustain one's interest, including disparate methods of capturing animals for containment in wildlife reserves, the continual problem of poaching, dangers when confronting feral beasts and a romantic relationship successfully brought to the fore amid many personality conflicts, as the story follows a young ranger employed by the nation's wildlife service (Brian O'Shaughnessy) who must deal with all of these mentioned circumstances during a pleasing adventure melodrama capably directed by cinematographer Sven Persson."
5,Equations & Formulas for the Traffic Accident Investigator,"Great resource manual for anyone reconstructing traffic crashes. Easy to navigate through, and contains both the short and long forms of each equation."
4,Equations and Formulas for the traffic accident Investigator,I used this book before because was a text on a seminar. It has all the formulas for the work of reconstruction of accidents.Now it was published for the use of most people outside and is must have for all people working the field of reconstruction of accidentsThank You Rafael Lopez
4,Fun and teaches balance,"This is a fun toy so far. Everyone wants to try it. It's challenging but helps with balance. I think once my kids (ages 11 & 8) get the hang of it, they will be walking all over. Just be careful that someone is there to ""spot"" and keep kids who want to try walking on these ""stilts"" away from fireplaces and TV's (of course)."
5,Great Fun!,I purchased this for my nephew for Christmas. He (and his siblings) loved them! He played with them from the minute they were taken out of the package for the rest of the day and after. I was told this was his favorite present this year. Great choice!
3,"My kids love these stilts, but they didn't last long",The foot part of these stils began to twist and turn while the kids used them. We super glued them.
3,good but not great,"I bought three of these walkers--one for each of my nephews and my niece. They were able to figure it out, but the footprint continuously turned inward--which throws their balance off. They are sturdy and good for coordination, but they cant control the foot from turning which was frustrating."
3,good and bad,"It is good that i feel like my keyboard will be cleaner longerBUT1. heat - i notice my computer gets heat up more than it used to be. Probably because the protection covers some of the ventilation provided by the spaces between the keys2. closing the case... there is now too much ""filling"" when I close the macbook, I almost feel like I'm breaking the hinge or something"
3,Heat!,I completely agree that this product greatly increases the heat of the computer. Is this a bad thing? Is it worth having a clean keyboard??This product DOES eliminate the yellow haze that takes over your white macbook in time.I don't notice any difference in closing the macbook.
3,i like it,"I take my computer to work, and my fingers get nasty and grimy so I Bought this item, which works well to keep my keys clean and when it gets dirty i just run it under warm water and it cleans. alot cheaper than buying new keys."
5,Love this product!,"I bought this over a year ago and love it! It fits perfectly over my keyboard and protects it from crumbs, spills, dirt etc. My keyboard still looks brand new and my computer is 4 years old! Love it!"
3,BUMMED OUT XMAS,THIS CD CAME WITH A CRACKED CASE BUT I WAS LOOKING FOR THE ONE SONG THAT WAS ON THE CD AND WAS HARD TO FIND SO I KEPT THE CD
2,This doesn't mix well,"If you try to put this in a 1 gal plastic jug and add fertilizer, there could be a chemical reaction and the protekt hardens and becomes floating pieces"
5,This One's From The Heart & Soul,"WOW! What a spectacular return to the recording studio! I know this woman had to go raise her children and put her recording-singing career aside, but, they should be grown by now and it's time for ""reinvention"". I have the soundtrack to ""One From The Heart""(1982) and she explores a Jazz atmosphere throughout with Tom Waits[as a duet partner and on a few solos]too perfectly to just set it aside. Crystal, if you're reading the reviews on your incredibly impassioned Hoagy tribute, PLEASE, if it works for Natalie Cole, then you should resume your career in JAZZ. You definitely have an awesome voice that is extremely well suited to sing whatever you desire to conquer. This Hoagy cd is flawless, from the song selection, SINGER, & musicians all the way up to the passionately performed vocals...this one's from the heart and soul!"
5,Top of the line.,"A surprisingly terrific album, pairing emotion-stirring and brilliant Hoagy Carmichael songs with Crystal Gayle's distinctive, crystal clear singing voice. Hours of enjoyment await you. Without a doubt, one of the truly great albums of American classics."
2,Would not recommend,"I used green cream level 6 for a very long time and was fairly happy with the results. This is a retinol night cream and should be used as such. With all that being said, the alcohol content in this product is very high and makes me think this product is a little on cheap the side. Yes alcohol can kill bacteria and is used in many products, but it is also an irritant for many people and some studies have shown it to increase the formation of wrinkles because of its drying properties. The consistency is also very thin, compared to most retinol formulas. This did help my acne, slightly, but the effects were minimal."
3,On the fence...,"Very irratating and seems to aggrevate breakouts. Seems to smoothe fine lines in more oily areas, though. Will keep using, but only sporatically since it is very drying, even on oily skin."
2,Not good for Acne,"I bought this product to help with my moderate acne and I was excited that anti-aging was a bonus. However, I just ended up breakin out more. It is pretty expensive so choose wisely."
4,Fantastic skin transformer,"I bought this green cream based on reviews I read on other sites. I have been using this cream for 2 weeks and so far I am very happy with the product. I used to use Retin A but it was very harsh on my face, it made it sting, redden, peel and become very sensitive to other products. This product while it does contain a retinol agent, does the job of exfoliating and bringing out fresh glowing skin without the irritation of other retinol products. I received a light peeling on my chin after 2 weeks of use, but it was easily remedied with a moisturizer. I have glowing skin and my fine lines are dramatically reduced. love this product."
1,green cream review,"Did not care for this product. I read instructions, followed them to a tea...noticed the changes they said would first occur, but as time went on, my skin looked worse and worse. After 4 weeks, i stopped using it."
3,Start Slowly,It can really irritate your skin when you first start using it. I only used a very small amount and it was still a problem. I wish I had started out with Level 3 because Level 6 left my face red and very dried out for days after only one use.
3,Green Cream is a good product......But,"I have been using Green Cream level 6 for about 3 months, and have had fair results with this product, it has helped with my hormonal acne breakouts and has helped my skin tone some. I have read other reviews that have had lots of purging with this product, but I never purged at all. I do believe this product is good for the average person and I know not all products work for everyone. I do think I need something stronger, so Im seriously considering purchasing Obagi Nu-Derm.Green Cream may be a good place to start because it may work for you and the price is very reasonable compared the Obagi Skin Care System"
3,May be some variability in quality,"Based on my dogs preference for these bones, there may be some variability in the quality. I can offer them one of the bones and they will refuse it, but if I offer a different one sometimes they will take that one. Not sure what this means other than I end up tossing out a lot of bones on which they refuse to chew."
4,light comedy at best!!,"It just proves, comedy doesn't have to be loud and obnious to be funny. Each one of us have a different oppinion about whats funny. Sometimes words aren't needed. People can have some of the funniest and cute expressions. They don't need words. I like it better. True, Jerry can be to silly at times. But he does a better job at trying then some of what people call comedy today. It's usually cheap and trashy. This is cute."
1,Errand Boy,This movie was not at all what I expected it to be. It is a series of skits run together with no real story line. I would not buy again for myself and diffinitly not as a gift.
2,"Details, details!","My VHS of THE ERRAND BOY is not an official studio release. It's one of those budget box brands and is not recorded in SP mode, nor does it have a HiFi audio track.Based on its width, the photo on this product page appears to be from a DVD, not a tape, so that's no help in determining exactly what version this may be.Suggest that a potential buyer email a targeted seller by using AMMY's ""contact"" feature, which can be accessed by clicking next to that dealer's name where it says: (0000 ratings). One might inquire if there's a full tape's worth in the cassette, or even what label it's under. GOODTIMES, ANCHOR BAY, SIMITAR, DIAMOND ENTERTAINMENT, MADACY and such are those slow speed VHS companies.NOTE: Contrary to a color photo on this page, THE ERRAND BOY was filmed in b&w;."
5,LOTS of POWER!,"Not as fancy as others in the same pricepoint, but with the analog power gauge and air compressor available it works great!The cables are very long compared to others and wrap up neat."
5,must have,Great piece of mind..though have not used yet and hope to never need. Heavy but not important as they are stored in rear of vehicle. Seems well built and great cust. service.
3,The proof of the pudding is in the eating,"Not only have I bought this book - I actually tried a few recipes.I must say that I was sooooo deeply disappointed because some of the recipes were just not ""it"" - especially after having such high hopes with this title.On the positive side, I will say that the graphics and the decorating ideas are great - you will just need to use your own recipes for cakes (at least the ones I tried)."
1,Young and Company,i bought the 12 in version of like what your doing to me thinking it was a nice digital copy but it sounds so bad im gonna delete it off my computer...to bad they dont say it was ripped from a record...sounds like garbage
5,Exceptional Work! Great Debut!!,"Heaven's Fury on Hell's Cafe is a wonderful debut! Erika Michelle has done a wonderful job of personification and fleshing out of the characters. I found the interaction to be very refreshing and well worth the time of reading. I certainly hope to see more from this author in the future, and would like to see more adventures from these two protagonists."
5,"A FLOWING, COMPELLING, MIND OPENER","A wonderful read, laced with Bible phrophecy, and today's lingo and standards. As you devour this book, you can't help but wonder, ""Will our final days actually resemble this story, as it unfolds?"" A unique, moving depiction!"
5,Useful and filled with lots of ideas,This book is filled with tons of ideas and detailed instruction on making and decorating bags.
1,Fooled by the Cover,"I was attracted to this book by its cover, so I pre-ordered it. After waiting 3+ months past the release date (Feb 6, 2006) it finally arrived in early May. Wow, what a disappointment! I was expecting some upscale professional design ideas for handbag embellishment. Instead, the ideas in this book are very cutsey-poo and childish. The only nice design is on the cover. These designs might be appropriate for very young girls (faux fur, poodle appliques, felt cat with rhinestones, pom-poms, costume jewelry decorations, etc) but not for the sophisticated handbag creator. A better choice for elegant handbag embellishment would be Stephane Kimura's BAGS WITH STYLE, or Barbara Weilands new book SEW EASY DESIGNER BAGS & TOTES."
4,Get This One!,Off the chain!! This book is all that you will need to get that project going. Very detailed and colorful. I own this book and I simply swear by it!! Very good purchase.
5,Great mug shape!,"Love this, it's large enough to have coffee out of or a can of soup when you're sick. Boyfriend loves it. Thanks."
5,harley dude,"Not only is it a great looking coffee mug, but it is very durable as well. Is also dishwasher safe."
4,A Short Long Trip,"Great CD! Awesome use of all abilities here, lyrics that will knock you out and much more...a must listen to! From a regular about town: it's the next big thing here in Beantown!"
5,Great product for the money,"Cannot find this particular item in the stores. Good Price for the item, and the product was shipped very quickly."
4,Works well,"Most shields for men don't cover as well as these. These are good, not perfect, but seem to be the best available. Price about the same as in stores, but sometimes hard to find in stores. Subscription with Amazon makes it easy--though they're scheduled to come often than needed, so I skip a delivery every other month."
1,price tripled,"Great item but now that Amazon has tripled the price I'll visit my local drug store. Plus, I had a subscription to receive three of these things every two months and Amazon billed my credit card without any prior warning that the price was going from less than $15 per pack to over $40 per pack. Bad business."
5,Works great,"The Tena mens pads stay in place and are not bulky under clothes. This product has been hard to find in retail stores, so finding them on Amazon was a real benefit."
4,Good design and fit; comfortable,"I recently had a radical prostatectomy. Any man who's had this surgery will understand how important it is to have a reliable product (to protect themselves from embarrassment and to promote good hygiene) for a few months (or possibly more) after coming home from the hospital. I agree with reviewers who describe the Serenity pads as more comfortable with a better fit than the more popular Depends pads. I also agree with the reviewer who said they don't have enough glue and don't hold well to your underclothes- but after two months of use, I have never had a problem with them falling out. I've tried Depends and Walgreen's new brand, and overall I still find the design of Serenity pads to be better suited for a man. They're not perfect, but they're pretty good.I also like the fact that they can be ordered easily using Amazon so I don't have to buy them in person at a drugstore."
4,good product,"I like this small bowl. Nice size for medium or small dog. It's easy to dry and clean after my dog used it, but little bit heavy to attach to leash. I attach this bowl to my purse."
3,"Driver Issues, but functional","This mouse looks good and responds well (so far), but has an issue with the usb connection. It only works on 1/5 of my usb ports, and even then I have to unplug and replug it in each time I start my computer to get it to be recognized. There may be an easy fix for that but I haven't found it.I love the sensitivity issue - 2 pre-set modes, to quickly go from detailed clicking to quick movement."
2,poor ergonomics,"They put the forward and back buttons on the side where I normally grab the mouse, so these buttons are frequently pushed accidently. Also the left and right buttons are too small."
1,DO NOT BUY FOR A MAC!,"I have used logitech mice on my Mac for many years. I didn't even notice on this product description that this mouse is NOT Mac compatible. It's their only mouse that I have seen that is not, so Mac users beware! I bought it, then had to return it. I specifically bought it for the shape and size, which is very comfortable for me, does not irritate my wrists and is ambidextrous. I actually wanted a corded mouse because they are lighter and easier to use for longer periods for people with wrist problems. Oh, well... I'll start reading the reviews on the cordless versions with similar shape/size."
3,Decent mouse but 3 flaws,"I have had this mouse for several months now. It performs well overall. I will only focus on the negatives. First it's not as good for gaming as I would like. I like logitech's other gaming mouse as this feels too small for my hand and too light. I am average in height so that means most people will find it too small. It feels like my hand drapes over it and so the sensitivity is not so good. Second the side buttons on both side of the mouse sticks out and gets in the way. When you have your hands around the mouse you will constantly feel this. Lastly, the mouse has a nice feature of having dynamic sensitive adjustments up to 5 but you have no idea which of the five you set it too other than basing on how the mouse cursor reacts when you move the mouse. This is hard to tell often times. These 3 flaws make this mouse not worth buying relative to the price for the other logitech mouse. But all other features are really good."
3,"Where's ""The Good Ole Days""? And My Little Pony: The Movie?","Okay. Yes, blah blah blah! They made one at the very least. I checked it out before thinking of buying it as I would recommend if you are really, really into something such as my little ponies are mine.And to be honest it was disapointing.1. The Episode order was out of whack.2. The My Little Pony: The Movie was not there.3. The Escape From Catrina missed one singing number ""What Happened To The Good Ole Days?""Personally for me, I want it to be accurate as it can be. And If I did buy this product, I would copy it and fix the order for myself.There were some jiggly screen moments. But I just sat back and excused it for 80's cartoons. Because there is a usual trait of 80's cartoons in having mistakes."
4,Wonderful! Worth it!!!!!!!!,"This 4-disc DVD set is really woth buying. It Includes the pilot episode, ""rescue at midnight castle"" and a MLP special, ""escape from Catrina"" The picture quality is so-so, but it is quite old, almost 20 years, so...... This set is def. a treasure, and if you ever adored these ponies like I did, I would recommend it."
5,I Love the Sea Ponies in the episodes!,"I got this for my birthday! I loved the song ""Count Upon the Sea Ponies""! I liked ""The Revolt of Paridise Estate"" too!I liked the episode ""The Magic Coins"" too!"
3,Classic series finally comes to DVD,"This is a classic series by Hasbro. It's sweet, cute, innocent, and carries good messages for kids. If you are looking for something for your little girl, this is an awesome DVD set. If you are a collector looking to finally get this old school gem, go nuts. In spite of the lack of extras,and closed captions; the syndicated versions of Firefly's Adventure and Escape from Katrina ( if you've seen the originals these versions will make you sick); and the shoddy box artwork, this set is well worth the purchase. My verdict: 4 stars for the series( a few production flubs keep it from perfection), and 3 stars for the DVD release( Don't expect all that came with Jem)."
3,Hard episode breaks,"More on the DVD's. I have played a few more episodes and find the break between multi-segment episodes seems very hard. A die hard MLP fan would beable to notice about 2-3 seconds of dialoge missing, but its still nice to have the show on DVD."
1,??,Why the heck is this three hundred and eighty four dollars. I love my little pony but I can't belive that price. Totally not worth it
3,WHERES GLOW WORM,I love MLP and have waited for these to come out for what seems like forever. I am deffinatly disapointed that the little cartoons in between the eposodes werent included (you remember glow worm and that other thing right??) but other then that I'm just glad I can finally have a charished memory in hand
3,Better when I was a kid,All I can say is that I was so excited to share this series with my 3 yr old daughter. And after watching it again after so my years I was greatly disappointed. She seemed to kind of enjoy it but not as much as I thought she would. She does like the ponies and the dragon but gets kind of scared by the villians. I remebered My Little Ponies being so my better when I was a kid.
1,WAY TOO SCARY FOR LITTLE KIDS,"Yeah, I know I'm about to earn the undying emnity and wrath of the many adult MLP fans, but for those buyng MLP products for little kids, you should know that this stuff is WAY TOO SCARY for the average little one. If your kids love the ponies of The Princess Promenade and A Very Minty Christmas, just be aware that this is NOT the same thing. Not only is it not the same ponies, and very poor quality animation compared to what is generally put out today, the plots are quite dark and contain many frightening elements, monsters, trolls, witches, etc. This is NOT for kids under age 8-9 years in my opinion."
1,Convoluted and full of mistakes,"The minimum requirement for a technology-oriented book would be that it gets the technology right. The Telecommunications Survival Guide does not pass this test. There are plenty of errors in there, some of them on a very conceptual level. For example, the authors confuse connection-oriented service with circuit switched service. These concepts are so basic, that they really should not be confused by any expert in the field.The writing style is supposed to be casual and funny, which is a good approach, however, often the text is somehow convoluted. Concepts are badly explained, and even in the examples it is sometimes hard to figure out what the authors are getting at.Overall comment: Not recommended at all, I'd give zero stars if there were the option."
1,Convoluted and full of mistakes,"The least one must expect from a ""telecommunications survival guide"" is that it got the facts right. This book does not pass the test. The authors get simple things wrong, which makes me wonder whether they have sufficient competency to write such a book. For example, they state that circuit switched service is the same as connectionless service. Gentlemen, this is fundamentally wrong!Moreover, the entire book is somewhat convoluted and confusing. Sometimes I had a hard time to grasp what the authors are trying to get at.I doubt that the Professor who wrote the positive review below has really read the book.I strongly discourage anybody to buy this book."
1,"Auful, Horrible, Full of Errors, Waste of Money!","...After reviewing the text and the associated Training CD I could not believe this ...ever got published. I found numerouse errors, omissions, and misinformation.In conclusion...I'll steer clear of any thing these authors publish in the future."
2,get the first one!!,"If you are not a writer, I don't see you getting anything from this. The first one is alot better, part 2 seems put together quickly. They interview some of the same people and there is not really alot of real graff involed. But in the end it makes a good part of a collection. If you want to get this I strongly urge you to get the first one! It is really almost a history of west coast graff, if you count LA as the whole of the west coast (I do not!) If you want a good graff movie go for COPE2 KINGS DESTROY!"
5,great stuff,"any one who works on cars & trucks knows that anti-seize lubricant is absolutely needed to keep nuts & bolts from fusing together & rusting away this stuff has been used by myself in both forms for many, many years now,you should always use this it wll save you the head aches of frozen & snapping bolts from rust & corrosion this will save your knuckles to"
5,"Wow, all I can say, Wow!","Bored with romance novels and the simpering fidelity and overly flowery language therein? So was I so I ventured into erotica. The price of the ticket was well worth it.Like many heterosexual females I'm intrigued by two men, or a woman and two men. If you're not stay away for there is that aplenty.It's probably some of the best writing I've ever seen in any category. Believable well rounded characters, really well reserached 18th century speech and clothing as well as settings, and penty of steaminess. Ms. Ellis makes you wait for every encounter and builds the anticipation. So when it comes, wow. All I can say is wow.My only beef is that the lesbian scene in the beginning seems abrupt and nowehere near as believable as the other sex scenes. Partly because it takes place with the unlikely Louisa, a virgin with a voyeur streak a mile wide who seems much more like a typical romance heroine than Bella, the main character.A must read for the enlightened female!"
2,Severe disappointment and not worth reading,"So I got this book based off the great reviews it got and boy was I disappointed. This book is about Bella Rushdale, who is extremely attracted to her new neighbor Lucerne Marlinscar, but she has a rival for his affections... the Marquis of Pennerley... a man. So who will Lucerne pick Bella or the Marquis?***Spoilers***I like erotic books, but I have never had a main heroine just absolutely disgust me. Yes the heroine, not the sex between two men, but the main character. This book is about Bella Rushdale, a woman who will climb and ride any man's penis. This woman has no morals (or conscience) and even sleeps with her best friend's man. She is like an animal in heat. I am all for woman being sexual beings and enjoying themselves, but not at the expense of hurting other's with their actions (even if her friend didn't find out about her absolute disgusting behavior). Bella was extremely unlikeable with her lack of morals, conscience, and character."
2,Meh,"Not very well written, all over the place and not very historically accurate either. The sex scenes were frequent in this book but short and not well developed or very hot for that matter. The character Bella was just a sex crazed maniac. Vaughn was a jerk and I couldn't see why any of the characters in the story would like him at all. Louisa character was wimpy and ineffectual. The whole book just left me cold not at all how an erotic novel should make you feel. Not to mention how effeminate the males in this story were; I prefer more masculine male characters. After reading this novel my Ms. Ellis I will not repeat the experience."
1,Terrible Product,"I had problems from day one with this player. It didn't work on one of my TV's...don't know why. As the other reviewer said, it has a subtitle glitch that while annoying is not that bad. Main problem is that it only lasted a few months(4). Then it stopped recognizing that a disk was loaded and was useless."
2,Pale reflection of their live shows,"If you've seen this band live, or even heard their live recordings, you know how wonderful they can be. But this CD sounds heartless; there is no style, but rather a conglomeration of musical themes without any real substance. Their skills are never lacking, but knowing what they are capable of will disappoint you if you purchase this one. Get the live one or, better yet, just go see them when they come to your area."
5,Another repackaging of the 1970 version of his Christmas Album,"This is just another packaging of the 1970 edition of the Elvis Christmas Album. It is a song-for-song copy of Elvis' ""Its Christmas Time"" CD, which is available at a much cheaper price.While the songs on here are excellent, I would recommend that you save a few bucks and pass on this and buy ""Its Christmas Time"" instead. Or if you really want a collection that has all of Elvis' Christmas songs, get his ""If Every Day Was Like Christmas"" CD. It has all 20 Christmas songs that Elvis recorded during his career in addition to four alternate versions not available anywhere else."
3,"An enjoyable, but not very substantial, read.","I found this novel to be quite disappointing. The mystery of the drug that had caused these brain defects was never explained - it was as though they thought that their readers would not understand an explaination. So all we know is that the condition of the Babies was caused by Metamide, but we do not know exactly what it did, why and how. The end was also extroidinarily stupid. I wondered what the Babies parents would have thought about them not being returned. How did the family get custody? And as for Greg and Mikki's wedding - vomit! Give me C.S.Lewis anyday."
2,A RATHER VAGUE SHOP MANUAL,"I bought this manual to be able to work on Chinese motor scooters. The problem I encountered was 1) that even within a single model year of a particular brand, there is no standardization of parts, and 2) that this manual is necessarily general and sometimes vague. The information one needs is probably there somewhere, but digging it out is tiresome. So is deciphering the Chinese rendition of the English language. Some of the images and diagrams are also confusing. I ended up selling off my Chinese motor scooters for what I paid for them and buying an Aprilia Scarabeo 150 (Italian design with an Austrian power train). It was the difference between night and day, and I cannot recommend Chinese scooters or this manual which does not really help much in a crunch. Two stars seems charitable."
3,Nose Hair Trimmers,It works but not very good as what he thought it would. he's happy with that type though.
1,This product does not work at all,"1 Star is too high for this product. What else can I say it simply does not cut nose hair, or any other hair for that matter. I could not even place a hair in it and get it to cut it, but try to use it as directed and it just pushes the hair out of the way. I bought a Panasonic powered nose hair cutter and it works great."
3,Poor Craftsmanship,"I steered towards the tweezerman line of products because their product photos portray a high level of craftsmanship.The reality, I'm afraid, doesn't live up to expectations.The nose hair trimmer, for example, isn't weighted properly, so it just floats in your hands... and the mechanism which rotates the inner blade isn't lubricated very well -- so it moves in a hurky-jerky fashion. Which is more than a little disconcerting.I also find that you have to position it ""just so"" to clip anything at all.I should have just purchased a pair of bull-nose scissors."
4,Works pretty well,"Works pretty well - the only electric I've ever used was a cheapo Remington model, and the problem with that (as I imagine is the problem with all electrics) is that it's hard to clean.With this, just run it under hot water and dry it off after using and it's fine. Also it's very small so fits easily into a dop kit."
2,Look to another product,The tweeszerman trimmer is over priced and does not work as well as advertised. I would look to another product for your nose trimming needs.
5,Great for Stitch fans,"While I personally can't stand this little blue fiend, my dad just adores him and is an avid collector of Stitch memorabilia, as it were. He had never seen this plush in stores and it is one of his favorites. And I must admit, it is pretty cute."
1,Cheap Construction,This is not worth the money. Luckily I got these for free because if I had to pay for cardboard I would be very upset. Go to walmart and buy heavy duty plastic ones if you want them to last.
5,Excellent Music!,"Looks like the other reviews are right on track! What more could be said... This is a great cd one which I'll be listening to quite often for a long time to come. Marcus has a unique voice which is like no other! The songs have so much meaning, and are sure to be a hit!"
2,Not so good,"Ok.. all this book has is 12 Tupac songs written out in musical note form with the song lyrics. Many of the lyrics in this book are incorrect and the music, when played, is only vaguely reminiscent of the sounds you hear on the Cd.. This is not a good book for someone who is a Tupac fan, but if you want to perform a Tupac song with a microphone and a piano in your next talent show, you might want to check this out. REPEAT: the lyrics are often incorrect."
5,tupacs alive,tupacs alive if he dont come back june 16 then thats just whack 4 pac to rap about faking his death and about the 7 day theory and everything else he faked his death straight up i hope pac comes back cause hes the illest rapper there iz no one raps like tupac pretty much rap aint the same with out pac and this book iz good buy it
3,"OK, Not the Spanish Alphabet","The video is a bit boring and it isn't the Spanish Alphabet (doesn't have CH, LL or ñ)."
3,"ONLY teaches the alphabet, narrator needs to speak up also","I purchased this video along with Fun With Numbers and Fun With Colors trying to teach my 2.5 yr old son Spanish. In Fun With Numbers/Colors they say sentances in English then in Spanish along with teaching the colors/numbers and objects. In this video they ONLY teach the letters. No letter recognition (M is for Manzana, P is for Pelota, etc) no talking at ALL outside of the alphabet. My son likes this DVD (mostly because of the train) wich is why I'm giving it 3 stars. As far as me watching it with him, I can't stand to watch more than 10 minutes without having to do something else because it's mind numbing.. there's relatively no excitement and too much repetition of only 27 letters (as typical with children's spanish alphabet they leave out ch, ll, and rr but they do have n-yay). The music on the DVD is great but needs to be turned down or the person needs to speak up because you can't hear some of the letters very well."
4,effective,"Despite the fact that the Spanish letters CH and LL have been eliminated completely, and though some scenes are repeated a LOT of times, my 2 year olds love this video and it has certainly helped them learn the alphabet. The pronunciation is perfect. (unlike another Spanish alphabet video that I bought)"
3,poor for price,"item ran slower in one direction correct speed in other?not worth money, new cost $99.when you consider you loose $10. or so to ship back."
2,BUYER BEWARE!,"As a previous customer/reviewer stated, the handle comes off. Mine came apart the first time I used it. I am going to try to repair it, but decided to write this review to let other future potential customers know that this is not an isolated case. BUYER BEWARE!"
5,Good Quality and Value,"Made in USA, this tool is good quality and very handy to keep in the tool box for occasional jobs. The handle is solid and comfortably sized for gripping. There is a medium-fine flat file on one side, a rounded rasp-like file on the other and a useful chisel on the end. Used with a hammer, this tool did a good job finishing notches in a 6x6 beam that were started with a dull chain saw."
3,Some Qualms,"I liked that this book was about a girl who cared about horses.This is the novelization of a 1980's horse movie.The main character volunteers to exercise ponies and horses at a local estate. At the estate she encounters a new jumping pony named Danny. Her mother doesn't quite apporove of her daughter working around horses and to make matters worse, is planning to remarry to an ""imitation cowboy."" Danny is a spunky little gray pony who has placed well in the past at competitions. The pony's new teenage owner, however, is not pleased with him and wants her father to buy her a new thoroughbred.What I did not like about this book was the fact that that girl still jumped Danny after he had sustained a leg injury, thus re-triggering it and just happily smiled and said something to the order of ""what a good pony, he jumped for me even though he was hurt!"" I thought that it was very irresponsible of the author to write."
3,Across the Spectrum Haggadah,"I found this Haggadah to be good, not great. It had all of the requisitedetail for the Seder, and a fairly well-organized and easy to read style.Still, I found some of the translations from Hebrew into English to beclumsy, awkward and in some cases difficult to understand at all.We are not Orthodox, so the constant references to ""Hashem"" was not something we are used to. But I bought this Haggadah knowing it could span from Orthodox across to Reform, so perhaps I should have considered that.All in all, it was more than adequate. My main critique was the clumsy English translations."
5,A good addition to the 30 minute seder,"I bought the 30 Minute Seder for my son, but also wanted the full Haggadah. My son looked through the book and was impressed with it. It will make a good companion to the simplified 30 Minute Seder."
3,Easy to use.,"I was surprised at how little Hebrew was used in the production and publication of this Haggadah. However, most seder attendees do not read Hebrew well and so it will serve its main purpose - to include all participants."
2,Trish BU,"This CD was a real disappointment. I didn't experienced the promised relaxation. Instead, I was simply bored by the music. I'll try it again sometime and hope it will be a different experience, but I don't hold out much hope for that."
5,OLD SKOOL,I BROUGHT THIS FOR MY DAD. HE IS A COLLECTOR OF MUSIC. HE IS REPLACING HIS VINYL WITH CD'S. ALL THE HITS ARE ON THIS.
5,THE TIGHTEST TRACKS,"I JUST WANNA GIVE MADD PROPS TO PETTIDEE FOR HIS DEBUT. HE HAS SOME OF THE PHATTEST BEATS OUT THERE AND HIS LYRICS ARE TIGHT, ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S SAYING. BUT HE ADDRESSES MANY ISSUES IN THE CHURCH AND WORLD TODAY (PREGNANCIES AND THUG LIFE). I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ANYONE WHO LOVES GOSPEL RAP. KEEP UP THE WORK PETTIDEE AND MAY GOD BLESS!"
5,Pettidee tightest Rap i've heard,This cd sound's like gangsta rap but is christian rap and iv'e never heard a better christian rap cd before that sounded so much like NO LIMIT rappers
4,"Great, trashy fun w/ stellar cast","I bought this because it was on sale at Tower (for 15 bucks!), and because of the forementioned crew of top notch talent - the line-up in this thing is unbelievable - and was very pleasantly surprised. Very entertaining from start to finish, with some very clever twists.If only I got such value for money every time I spent $15!"
1,never got the product,"Never got the product, used the librarys computer to order the product and never got accesss to a computer untill now. be caustious buying online i guess."
3,BEWARE installs copy protection,"BEWARE that this CD will install some kind of copy protection. There's a warning on the back of the jewel case that it may not work on some equipment, such as car CD players(!). On a PC you can hold down the shift key to prevent autorun from running, and then use your favorite program to play or rip the tracks. I don't know if people with iPods will have trouble. I gave this CD 3 stars instead of the minimum because I blame EMI, not Craig Douglas, for this. I'll certainly be cautious about buying anything else from EMI."
5,"THIS IS LIVE, THIS IS AWESOME.......","This dvd is a must for any Bleeding Through fans. The intensity is high on this dvd. One of my favorite live dvds since Death's dvd "" Live in L.A."" They play a range of songs from ""This is love...."" and ""Portrait of a...."". Excellent sound quality also. Bottom line this is a show unlike any metal or hardcore show you have ever seen. \m/ \m/- Daniel Damnation"
2,Very boring,"I am a Trekkie from way back, but I had a very difficult time reading this book. I even skipped several chapters, thinking it might get better, but, um, no... so I didn't finish it. I did scan it though, to see if it was the same all the way to the end, which it was, so I put it down. If you were involved in writing any of the Trek magazines, I'm sure it would be more interesting to you. I guess I should have read the intro more thoroughly."
1,I could have done better,"Just because the writer was a doctor does not lend creditablility to the information. It was terrible. Way to juvenile.I have a small team of racers that I support. Three sisters from a family of eight(8) kids. So, I support the three (3) oldest to the tune of 15-16K in 2006. We have six race bikes and two practice bikes. Our biggest supporter is a local mechanic that donates his time for free. I am able to do quit a bit of the maintance, but not the big stuff. We drive 140 miles round trip across Phoenix friday afternoons to get to our track. That is a story into it's self. We have won three races, but it's mostly for me to spoil some kids that their parents are not able to because of the size of the family. So I help a little.I contacted Amazon for a return label to return this book, and I am still waiting.""Mr.B"""
1,"MVP Baseball, great for console, bad for psp","While the console version is the best baseball game i have ever played, the PSP version of MVP baseball is the complete opposite. The game is very grainy and sluggish, and does not play smooth. The graphics are nowhere near the level of MLB, and the load times are forever. Hitting is nearly immpossible at even the rookie level. I had this game for under 6 hours before returning it. Although i love MVP Baseball 2005 for my PS2, the psp version is the complete opposite. I would highly recommend staying away from this game: It is a complete waste of money."
1,Frozen Screen After Player Switch,"I too waited for this game instead of buying MLB Baseball at a lower price and I totally regretted it. The game play is average and very slow on transition. You can only Save and Quit in the middle of the game without the option to Save only and not to have to quit. I believe there is also a bug with the game. From time to time when the computer player do a pinch hit or any switch, the screen will freeze and it does not allow you to do anything than to reboot. Think about playing a game up to 8 inning and the system freezes up on you and because you can't save it and continue playing, you wasted 20-30 minutes for a game that you have to restart.AVOID AT ALL COST."
3,"Not Fun, Not Intresting, Not Good","I hated this game. It wasn't fun, yet the sound and graphics were well done. I didn't find it fun at all. It's so... so... boring. (sigh) The price is way too high. This game should be around $25. But, instead I had to pay 50 dollars just for this crappy game. I haven't played the PS2 version, but I would recommend buying that instead of this."
4,Great game if there were no glitches.,"This is one of the best baseball games you could ever play and along with quality music and items that are able to be unlocked make this game great if it weren't for the glitches for this game on the Sony PSP.-The pitching is very controllable since you can pretty much pinpoint where you are going to pitch if you get everything right and the batting is simple that you would just swing away that along with your timing and location can easily turn and hits successfully.- The music is quality music and upbeat enough that you just feel the adrenaline pumping through your veins.- You get MVP points by playing games by accomplishing different stats during the game played that can in turn be used to unlock retro jersey, stadiums, and players.- The only reason I gave this one 4 out of 5 stars is that it would sometimes get glitches that make the side to side or up to bottom controls useless and would have to restart the game."
3,MMMMMMMMMMMMM Okay,"This game has okay graphics but it freezes everytime you hit start or every hit or when you begin the game. It took four minutes to load up the start. EA could have put a little more time into this like puuting owners mode into the game instead of rewards like players you can't even choose. I could have played Mickey Mantle but it just won't let me.Even though there are a lot of rewards like 119 jersey's from the 1900's and 2 legendary teams, 30 stadiums( I'm not sure if this is precise) The graphics are definetly choppy, the backgrounds look like a kid drew them. The players animation are great. I only have 2 PSP games and 1 movie so this is definatly better than Spider Man. The most easiest game on the PSP. Too easy. I'd pick this game up. Graphics- 4/5Controls- 5/5Gameplay- 3/5Educational 4/5"
1,The material in this book is severely outdated,"Don't buy this book unless it is for nostalgic reasons. As a guide for decision-making and policy-setting it is hopelessly outdated. Some of Hendersons statements, such as: ""High margins and market share go together"", send shivers down the back. Even some of the newer material, such as the article on Economic Value Added, is clearly in the wrong. And it almost totally misses out on what is today perhaps the most important perspective on corporate strategy: the focus on value, e.g. the linking of financial theory and corporate strategy."
4,Consult this!,"Hello,This is a great collection of short articles from one of the most influential business consulting companies of all times.So, if you can put up with or filter out some of the bizarre and apparently politically motivated comments then what you get is a fascinating history of the development of strategic thought in quite a number of key business areas.Naturally, this is not a ""how to"" or a ""biz strategy for dummies"" book, but it does well in explaining some key concepts and of generating a desire to know more, that is, if you don't already know it all.Regards,martyn_jones@iniciativas.com"
4,Good collection of concepts in Strategy,"When I buy this book I expect to learn more about strategy, business and enterprises, and I must say I get it.There is a good description of some difficult concepts, and I fine approach to competetive entreprises rules. It is not the definitive book about it, but there is no definitive book for this.It is rigth that this is not a new book, and some of the articles are old ones (from 1960's and 70's) but If you are not an expert and you look for a complete review, you get your money back.And for last, I must confess that I like the content."
5,Classic Untapped Jerry Lee,"As a long time fan of the Killer I was very surprised to find these ""lost"" tracks which I never knew existed. This compilation literally blew me away. There's not a song on this CD that's not top-notch.OK, ""Whole Lotta Twistin' Goin' On"" is basically ""Whole Lotta Shakin'"" with a few lyric changes. Still, Lewis manages to make it entertaining. His instro rendition of ""In the Mood"" is dynamite and I've never heard a bawdier version of ""Big-Legged Woman"". If you enjoy Jerry Lee at all this is a ""must"" buy!"
3,Tracks have been released on other compilations.,"Strictly speaking, not a ""rare"" recording. With the exception of the bonus tracks, all titles have been released on the Bear Family ""Complete Sun Recordings.."" boxed set. CD quality is good. ""Hong Kong Blues"" is an outstanding track, disappointing only in that it needs more verses to be viable. ""Sail Away"" sung with Charlie Rich is also good. ""Twistin'"" is the same song as ""Shakin'"". No one expects ""Birthday Cake"" to make it to market, especially JLL."
5,Classic Jerry Lewis,I ordered this Jerry Lewis movie because I wanted my grandchildren to watch classic comedy. They loved it. I'll be tracking down more old movies for this purpose.
3,JERRY BOY,"I THINK I LAUGHED MORE WHEN I WAS A KID. BUT IT WAS A O K SHOW, I DID NOTLAUGH A MUCH AT 45 YEARS OLD , BUTS ITS O K. GOD bless , jd"
2,A One Laugh Comedy!,I saw Jerry Lewis in Cinderfella and I liked it but I watched The Disorderly Orderly and since I love slapstick humor I thought I would love this movie but really it wasn't all that funny and when Jerry Lewis would use that loud voice for his character that gave the head nurse headaches it just kind of got on my nerves too. I laughed once during this movie and that was when he was outside and the psychiatric patient tied him up in the straight jacket and he very slowly was trying to make his way back to the inside of the hospital and a snail passed him moving faster then he was.
3,Maybe my sense of humor has changed or something????,"I remembered seeing Cinderfella a long time ago and thinking it was so funny, so when I came across this film, I was excited about seeing it. Well, let's just say I could not finish this one. It just wasn't funny. Jerry Lewis was just loud and silly but that doesn't automatically equal funny in my book. I am going to rent Cinderfella soon and see if I still think that is funny. If I don't find it funny, I will amend this review because then I know my sense of humor has changed and I guess this really wouldn't be a fair review. Until then, I can't give it more than a few stars. It wasn't absolutely awful, but just wasn't fun or funny enough to hold my interest."
1,what a shame,"I bought this product for my husband for xmas as he is a big fan. I had searched for it everywhere and was so pleased when I found it on amazon. He was delighted when he opened it xmas day but the delight soon changed to disappointment when, we realised we were unable to play a U.S. dvd on our recorder.There was no information on the web site that this would be a problem in the U.K and I felt awful.I, because I felt so bad, spent my xmas money on a dvd player that was compatible with U.S dvds. Please would you make this clearer to thick people like me on your web site."
4,"""The Disorderly Orderly's on Duty Tonight""","I was born with a severe heart condition. In 1979, at age five, I had a brain abcess. In 1982 I had opened heart surgery. In 2004 I had a pacemaker implanter. This movie's medical humor is funny--and as you have read; I ought to know!This is also one of the best romantic comedies I have seen (Jerry Lewis or otherwise). Believe it or not, it's a tearjerker."
5,Perfect alternative to Retinol,Great product and wonderful results. I've used Retin-A and Retinol and this is easier on the skin with beautiful results. Highly recommend.
2,A step of from level 6,"I stepped to level 9, after using level 6 for about eight months. Once I stepped up I finally began to see wrinkles become less prominent, and my acne more manageable. However, my skin became so red and irritated and my usually oily skin began to dry out. The results I did see were not worth the side effects and were not worth the money. Green Cream in general has a high alcohol content, and I first became aware of this when I started using Level 9 and found out this is what was most likely making my skin dry. There are far better retinol treatments on the market, especially for the amount that is paid for these products."
5,A Life Timer,"I have used this product for more than 25 years, beginning when it was available as a prescription only from the outstanding dermatologist Dr. Nia Terezakis in New Orleans. I believe that there are even stronger formulas still available from Dr. Terezakis by prescription only, but this is sufficient for me.Over the years of use, I have received many compliments about the appearance of my skin. This product has helped me control my hyper-pigmentation in conjunction with 4% hydroquinone. Although I no longer need to use the hydroquinone daily, I do use the green cream nightly.Be cautioned that you should start with the lower levels and work up higher. If occasional redness occurs, as it does on just one side of my neck, then rest the area for a few days.I have taken the advice of all dermatologists to use a good sun screen daily, which has become a habit -- rain or shine!"
2,Wrinkles too much,"I bought five of these shirts (different colors) and noticed that the shirts were quite badly wrinkled after removing them from the laundry. But I thought that this would simply subside over time as the shirts went into the wash several more times. Well, several months and after many, many washes; these shirts still suffer from wrinkling far more than any other shirt that I own. The shirts themselves are generally average otherwise. One button has come off, but that's not terribly unusual. But the wrinkles would keep me from buying these again. Too bad I bought so many at one time. Lesson learned."
1,What can be said about The Monkees,"Lives.....Get some. If you cant seem to get one then you should look into buying one. This complilation's jule case will make a good door stop. And the cd makes for a good frisbee. My dog Bubbles enjoys the time out in the park with this CD. I am looking into purchasing more for Bubbles. We have won the Canadain Frisbee Championship with the Monkees Missing Links V.2 Frisbee. A friend of mine says The Monkees headquarters would make an even better frisbee...Bubbles and I expect to win the world Championships with this one. If you like the monkees CD's you may also want to try Frisbee's by Hermans Hermits, The Hollies, and The Lovin' Spoonfull. However, If you realy do have pulse you may want to try to listen to DAVE MATTHEWS BAND...They REALLY do play thier own instruments."
4,Great outtakes that should've been released in the 60s.,"For the most part,the album consists of a group of great songs (Mostly used only on the Show) that were much better than some of the songs that were included on the albums of the 60s.Songs like All The King's Horses, Come On In, and Do Not Ask For Love (Prithee) are all good,solid songs that should never have been left unreleased for 25 years.Of course,there wee some less-than-great songs on Missing Links vol. 2.In my opinion, Michigan Blackhawk and The Crippled Lion just weren't that great.And the original versions of I Wanna Be Free, Words, and You Just May Be The One are worth the price of the album alone.All in all,Missing Links vol. 2 is worth the money."
5,The sweetest baby book ever!,"My husband bought this book for me on Mother's Day and it was the best gift ever. I and my 10 month old daughter love it! It's simple, sweet, and tender. The rhymes are perfect for little ears and the illustrations of the animals are beautiful. Mommies - you won't be disappointed. This is sure to be a classic. I just wish they had a boardbook version!"
5,Adorable!,This has got to be the sweetest book ever. We rented it from the library and I just had to get online to buy a copy to keep. My two year old really loves the pictures.
4,Great bedtime book,My 2 year old daughter loves loves loves this book. It is a lot of fun to read at bedtime. Beautiful illustrations. We've gotten it as presents for all our friends with babies.
4,the sublime country blues from lambchop,"This album is a smooth, crisp addition to lambchops reportoire of albums. I was taken aback by the first tracks polished high quality, and the jazz/blues influence uncharacteristic of the previous album.Then track four appears and absolubtly blows you away with its upbeat happiness, powerful strings and wagners falsetto, combining to make an amazing rendition of cutis mayfields classic! I have not listened to much of the album because of these two songs!"
1,unintelligible lyrics,Memo to Lamb Chop: Don't quit the day job. This was the first and last CD I will ever buy from lambchop. the music is okay but I couldn't make hide or hare of the lyrics. For the most part the lyrics were mumbled unintelligibly into the background
2,I still don't see what people see in this movie?,I have seen both the original and this remake. I much prefer this remake as it looks much better (and more modern) than the original. Still I don't much like either version. It isn't that good of a sci-fi plot. I guess its claim to fame is that it was one of the first.
1,DIE STUPID KID! DIE!!!,"I was a BIG fan of the original film. This new version had great potential IF it weren't for that STUPID KID in this film. That's right you little stupid boy, kill the alien, call the cops on the alien, interfere with and stop the most important questions in the movie we all wanted asked and answered when the alien met with a Nobel Prize winner, etc...The only thing that would have made this movie incredible, would have been if the annoying little punk kid DIED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Hah, I feel better now getting that off my chest. Oh, and if you are a fan of the original film like I am, do not buy this, just rent it and save your money."
5,"The same story, but for today","I hesitate in giving it 4 stars, but it really was remade perfectly. Keanu Reeves, while usually fine in this kind of sci-fi space, seemed muted in his performance, and that watered down the intent of the movie. It's the story line that came through for me. Completely addressing today's problems: us. I also like that who Klato really was would, ""just frighten us"", and that he had to be ""born"" here, in order to function on our planet. Little points like that made for realism. It's one of those movies that you'll want to own because you'll be wanting to watch over and over. Humanizing."
3,60 Minutes,"Having been on earth for just more than six decades, I feel qualified in saying that the remake of this Sci-Fi classic is definitely the day the movie theatres stood still. I was 2...that's right, 2, when the 1951 classic TDTESS was released starring Michael Dennie and Patricia Neal...in black and white (of course). The 2008 remake stars Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly, a handsome and beautiful duo that have earned Academy recognition through the years. Stick to the 1951 classic. This one has all the millennium effects, sound and dull script, but it would have been much better if it had been condensed to a 60-minute remake on cable (like Masters of Horror). This was a yawner...had its moments...and the only saving grace was the beautiful countenance of Jennifer...she is just filled with natural beauty but she is much better cast in other films. I have to give 3 stars because of the casting and special effects. Cut this baby to 60 minutes and you have a winner."
4,"Hadn't Seen the Original, But This Version Was Good Too","I know a lot of people loyal to the original would be more than happy to downplay this version. I haven't seen the original to make an accurate comparison, but I though this was a well filmed movie. I am impressed by the screenplay and the pacing. We already see Dr. Benson's life get interrupted by the urgency of something that is a threat to national security. The reactions to the whole situation are very realistic. Connelly and Reeves do an excellent job carrying the story.What really makes the film convey the drama is the reactions to the situations which builds the suspense of the movie.Of course, there is nothing like the original, but this movie holds its own for entertainment."
3,It leaves you wanting....,"Well, it wasn't your tipical Reeves's movie. I think it was missing a lot more action for his type of movies. I think he's going soft. I know it was a remake of an older version, yet, since they changed the sorry, might as well, change it completely and add more action to it."
3,"It is not that bad of movie, but","The movie is not that bad, the story has been updated, as for Keanu Reeves, I think he has it right on, a bit disconnected without much emotions (but after all he is playing an alien from a different plane). From my perspective one of the major problem with this movie is the kid and the other perhaps is the movie's message.In the original story the child was a lovable one, in this film he is very obnoxious, smug, smirking, and is very unlikable brat. To cast Will Smith's son was a huge mistake in this movie.The original movie taken place in the time of the Cold War, and now it is more of an ecological issue, despite the fact that we are facing wars on several fronts, with nuclear destruction is just as possible if not more now than in the 1950's."
2,Some movies should not be remade,"I was really hoping this would be a fresh take on a classic movie. Anything is possible. However, it would seem they spent all the money on special effects and small change on the script. What a wasted opportunity. Keanu Reeves walks through the movie like he's not connected to anything or anybody, even the script. If you really want to see a good film, see the original."
2,The original is great. The re-make doesn't reflect its own talent.,"Let me be brief. I hadn't seen the original since I was a kid. The re-make on blu-ray allowed me to see the original again. Michael Rennie is as good as Jose Ferrar in The Caine Mutiny. The re-make wanted to be on a level with Dark City and The Matrix. Not even close. But not for lack of talent or hard work. The effects? Again, not on a par with, say, the 1998 Godzilla. District 9 totally blows this re-make away on every count. I feel sorry for the wasted effort. Like I've said about other movies, the people tried really hard. What is it that ruins a movie like this?"
1,The Day Creativity Stood Still,Really this film deserves negative stars. Some day in the future when plastic is scarce this DVD will become valuable. It's difficult for me to imagine how intelligent people could have spent so much money on such an awful film.
3,Happy Presidents Day!!!,"I watched the original for the first time two days before I saw this one. This pretty much has the same plot, but it's done in a very different way. I didn't like that the flying saucer was a gigantic glowing ball, but it was cool. I loved that Gort was 100 feet tall in this one and looked more scary. Keanu Reeves did a pretty good job as Klaatu, who warns that if the people of Earth that if they don't stop the violence, the humans of Earth will be destroyed. I wasn't a big fan of Helen Benson' step-son being black and hated Klaatu, because in the original, her son was white and became friends with him. (I'm not racist.) My dad might have been a little disappointed because he thought it wasn't as good as the original. I did like the awesome night scenes and when it rained. If you are a fan of the original classic, you might like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL!!!"
1,Boring!!!!,This movie (the remake - not the 1951 version) dragged so much I could barely stay awake. Finally stopped watching -- this DVD is a garage sale candidate.
3,Late arrival,"Works well, but did not receive initial item. Waited 3 weeks, then called Amazon about the problem, to which they promptly issued me a new copy and sent it on its way."
4,Really Good Movie,"When I renting this movie I wasn't expecting much because most of the reviews were negative. However, I really enjoyed this film. I think older 'classics' are largely overrated, and that effects peoples' judgment. Don't get more wrong, I enjoy older movies every now and then. A Clockwork Orange, Jacobs, Ladder, Hellraiser, The Shining, The Godfather, Rosemary's Baby, 2001: A Space Odyssey.. all among my favorites. I've never seen the original version of this, but there was nothing wrong with this movie. The effects were cool. The story was entertaining. Acting was good. I am probably going to go out and buy it, and I would strongly recommend it. I can't justify giving this movie a negative rating. The only thing about it that I could do without is Klaatu's gradual development of knowledge of the human condition. Being an intelligent life form you'd thing he'd have some experience in cognition and emotions. Besides that, I'd give it a B-B+."
1,What a waste!,This picture should have been rated DDD for Dull Dopey and Dumb. There are some classic pictures that should not be remade. This was one of them. I actually like Jennifer Connelly too bad her talents are wasted in this dopey remake. Don't buy this video.
2,disappointed with the ending,"This movie had good special effects and it did have some fun scenes in it. The people of the earth is destroying the planet along with each other, so aliens came to destory the people so the planet can be safe. I can understand that to a certain point. While the alien is stationed on earth, we continue to attack it again and again. The alien speaker wishes to speak to the leaders, but instead, just a person who would communicate to the president (why do I need to repeat myself twice). Anyway, the alien stop killing us and we still haven't learn our lesson about war and fighting and trying to save the planet. It was pointless."
1,"The worst sci-fi remake, ever.","If you're familiar with the original classic of this movie, then there's nothing I can tell you about the story that you don't already know. For those that have never seen the original STOP and DO NOT purchase this remake because IT IS HORRIBLE plain and simple. I am astounded that Keanu Reeves would even consider playing in this remake.When one is considering remaking a classic one has to first ask why. Would one take a classic painting or musical composition, say Beethovens Fifth Symphony, and do a rewrite??? Is the producer or director so egotistical and arrogant that he thinks he can do a better job with a classic than the original? Some examples of this misguided creativity come to mind: ""The Thing""', ""Clash of the Titans"". I'll say no more other than to say if you really want to spend the money send it to me instead!"
1,The Day Keanu Stood Still,"The remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is perhaps the most reprehensible film remake in the history of film-making, showing a complete lack of respect for the original. The remake is contemptible, pathetic, ridiculous, and an affront to everybody who loved the original. Please boycott this film to show Hollywood that they will not be rewarded for destroying cinematic classics."
1,Irritating Disappointment,"As to whether you should buy the DVD version of the film, I recommend that you buy it if you are a fan of the irresistibly beautiful Jennifer Connelly, or if you are a fan of the precision performances of Keanu Reeves. However, you may be disappointed to find that the movie deviated significantly from the original 1951 version."
5,I LIKE THIS MOVIE GREAT MESSAGE WE NEED CHANGE THE WORLD,"GREAT MOVIE, WE NEED CHANGE THE WORLD NOW,GRAN PELICULA, A MUCHAS PERSONAS NO LES GUSTA, PORQUE TRATA QUE DEBEMOS CAMBIAR NUESTRA FORMA DE PENSAR, COMO SERES HUMANOS Y COMO TRATAMOS A NUESTRO PLANETA. EL HUMANO SOLO PIENSA EN DESTRUCCION Y EN DESTRUIR A SU PROPIA RAZA, CON TANTO ODIO Y RACISMO. NOSOTROS MISMOS NOS QUEREMOS ANIQUILAR, ALGUNOS NO SOPORTAN QUE OTROS SEAN MEJORES O TENGAN ALGO MEJOR. Y HASTA EL ULTIMO MOMENTO QUIEREN CAMBIAR SUS ACTITUDES. OLVIDENSE DEL RACISMO, DE LOS COLORES, TODOS SOMOS HUMANOS, Y A TODOS NOS DUELEN NUESTROS SERES QUERIDOS, NO HAGAS A OTROS LO QUE NO QUIERES PARA TU PROPIA FAMILIA.COMO DIJO MICHAEL JACKSON: WE ARE THE WORLD, MAKE A BETTER PLACE FOR LIVING."
1,Keanu Reeves at his best.. Which is BAD BAD and no good.,"This is a slow dumb movie. The best parts are in the preview. Thats it. Beleive me there is nothing good about this movie and keanu needs to take a break from making movies for the next 20+ years. Bad movie, Bad Acting"
1,Bad,To keep it short this movie was bad there like an hour of talking & 2 action scenes. Its really boring confusing just save your money & stay away from this one. I learn the hard way
1,Politially correct mishmash of garbage,I'm a Keanu Reeves fan but he can't save this mess. Bad casting (Connolly is dreadful) and the p.c. preaching chases me away. I've walked out of a number of movies but dislike wasting the $$ so I see a lot fewer in the theatre. Gave up on this DVD before the end. Don't waste your $$; re-watch a Matrix movie instead.
2,Why A Remake of a Classic?,"O.K., sucker that I am I bought this on Blu-ray due to the fact that I loved the original and I thought by what they can do with special effects today, this would be great. Little did I know how wrong I was. Some of the extras that are included on this special edition stated that Fox had wanted to do a remake of the original for quite some time. I still wonder why. Despite a lot of jabs at Keanu for playing so wooden, look people he was an alien and I thought did a good job trying to play human. Doesn't anyone remember Jeff Bridges in Starman? The brat of this remake should have been destroyed by Gort from the very beginning. Talk about your obnoxious kid! I had mixed feelings while watching this film. I liked some parts and others I thought stunk! I guess it's due to the fact that I have watched the original so many times that this remake really didn't do it for me. I hated the ending, but that's just my opinion. I too would recommend renting this instead of buying."
5,must see,"this is a great movie, with the EXTRAS. worth every penny.the bonus disk writes the mivie to a MO4 player, so you can watch on the GO. GREAT..."
1,One star for Connelly and Smith,"Jennifer Connelly and young Jaden Smith are the only reasons to watch this dreck. The rest of it is silly, dull, preachy, with cheesy effects and the most wooden performance yet (and that's saying something) by Keanu Reeves.mild spoiler.....Apparently, we humans have trashed our planet so badly that other beings must intervene so save the other species by getting rid of us. But then Keanu/Klaatu notices that a stepmom and son can have a tender moment, so he changes his mind and we are spared after all.Have you had enough yet?There's really nothing else to say."
1,"Oh no, I think I may have poisoned my mind",This movie was pathetic. Fortunately the edition I bought also included the original. I will need to sit down and watch the original several times in order to purge the poison that was left behind by this mess. Nearly everything about this movie was awful. I thank God for the original movie that was included so that this affair was not a total waste of time & money. Thanks God! (Spoken while pointing both index fingers toward the Heavens!)
1,Washing my car is more captivating,"After popping a total of [...] to see this piece of crap with my kids, I am convinced Hollywood must be destroyed. This is to science fiction what Josie and the Pussycats was to drama."
1,Laughable,"The director couldn't make up his mind whether he wanted to recreate the paranoia of the '50s or the politics of the present. The depiction of an overboard military, political and scientific response to the invading Christmas tree ornaments was laughable. Script and acting were high school acting sophomoric. The science/technology was so absurd that any decent high school science student could poke innumerable holes in this movie. Producers do not want to hire science advisors because a dumbed down product makes more money. One example demonstrates the whole movie: To convey the emotional/informational impact of the moment the director does nothing more than a prolonged camera close up of a pretty face as the FIRST person to approach the alien space ship. That time worn shot is as creative as they can be? And, why a microbiologist (of all people) would be allowed to walk up and touch it is beyond comprehension. CSI crime scenes show more intelligence."
1,Saying it's a turkey would be insulting the bird,"To say this movie is a remake of the classic Day the Earth Stood Still would also be an insulting to a great movie. Other people have given reviews on this movie so i'm not going over the same thing they did. (Please read theirs) It looks like someone wrote a story and couldn't sell it under that title so it was done a little different so they could use this title. It seams like that is being done a lot these days. (Like in the War of the Worlds, Wild Wild West) I watch these so-caled remakes hoping they will do justic to the original (like King Kong) but only found one worth getting on dvd, The Time Machine. Someone I know ordered it on pay-per-view the day I saw it and I was very happy I did not put any money out. I really don't want it even if it was given to me."
1,Classic movie buff at heart,"Not even close! My 37 year old son has never seen the original movie untila few weeks ago and he loved it, we watched the remake last weekend and we both were very disappointed, I guess the movies of today depend on special effects more then on good acting, we both give this poor attemped for a remake one star only because you did not have a minus category."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,this movie like in many other reviews is unwatchable i was kinda interested at first but then got sooooooooooooo boring no interseting scenes nothing. This is why i hate watching movies from this decade i prefer watching films before this decade. i work at the movie theatre and im so glad i watch them for free
1,Awful,"Bad, bad, bad. The only interesting thing about it is the sphere. And that's not that interesting. It's really horrendously bad. Don't spend your money. And the eco-babble is so much less compelling and so much more narcissistic than the original nuclear issue. STAY AWAY!"
3,"Keanu finally plays an alien, irony!","The Day the Earth Stood Still starring Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly is not great but it's not horrible either. The reviews for this film were pretty harsh and of course everyone is comparing this one to the original so it's hard to give an accurate criticism. I am not a fan of Jaden Smith, that kid just ruined this movie for me. Connelly is the only actor worth watching, her performance is honest and intriguing. The special effects are cool but the writing is somewhat contrived. It's a mixed bag for me."
2,Disappointing And Forgettable.,"It is a sequence of scenes, some have good CGI's, other do not. But it does not add up to a story, or a good movie. My consolation is that I only spend a single $1 rental fee.What a shame!"
1,"bad humans, bad, bad!!","I have only wanted my money back for one movie in my life and that was jurassic park 2 and that was because there was a junior high school class in the theatre chucking ice and popcorn. I even sat thru tank girl. This movie is preachy crap. Notice that the little sterilizing nanites that gort becomes only get close-ups when they eat big bad polluting semis, oil refineries, rednecks and football stadiums. When klaatu and the kid are hitching a ride in the back of a big 4x4, who's driving but beer swilling white trash? All you people who liked this movie need a refund for your lobotomys. I get preached at every day for being the big bad white destroyer of the world in the news and in the markets where I am forced to go green whether I want to or not. I definitely don't need to hear it here. I'm going to use this movie for a coaster. Watch the classic folks."
1,The Day the Earth Stood Still,This is a typical far left wing look at global warming/climate change seen in recent history. They had to change global warming to climate change since the earth has been cooling since 1999. The only similarity between the early masterpiece and this junk is the title. What a waste of good actors. Had the writers taken the early version serioulsy and baised there movie on weapons of mass distruction with delivery systems (as the first one was) using the fantastic new graphics it could have been an amazing movie.
2,Keanu Reeves,I cant really review the movie as I fell asleep less than half way through but one thing struck a cord with me... Keanu Reeves finally in a role that is good for him... An allien with limited facial expression... what usually is what makes his performance horrible suddenly plays in as a strength..... Maybe he should be typecast for roles like this for the rest of his career
2,The Day the Earth Stood Still,The first movie was way better then this one.I have told friends not to buyit.I'll let watch my DVD.Save your dollars.
1,What can anyone say?,"Why are there no negative stars?Makes you deeply yearn for a ""colorized"" version of the original.Hollywood propaganda .....got to be for the choir."
2,Day the Earth Stood Still 2009,"I was disappointed. Remakes rarely do a good job.The new War of the Worlds is another examples.These are two of my old favorites, both ruined."
1,The day political correctness destroyed a classic,"This movie was a remake that shares little with the original, except that both movies came in the same box. The alien (Klaatu, played by Reeves) has come to Earth to destroy humanity for not taking care of the planet. (Can you say eco-terrorism?) He is made to change his mind by seeing the black child and his white step mother (Connelly) cry when faced with death. Talk about political correctness- aside from the whole interracial family, the father died in the Gulf war, and the government was absurdly war like.The only thing that kept me from being totally disgusted was the fact that this movie came with the original classic in the same box.Bleh."
3,Check your Blu-ray Region Code,"If you are buying this set internationally for a blu-ray player check your region code. A Blu-ray player with Multi-Zoning for DVDs does not work on Blu-Ray. Blu-ray uses different Region Codes (A,B and C) and there is no multi-zoning for them as yet. I got caught with this Disc Set assuming it would play because all my other DVDs do. BUT IT DOESN'T... and I'm really annoyed at having wasted $50NZ for something I can't use. Amazon also needs to state more clearly what region Blu-ray discs are coded for so newbies like me don't get caught. Apart from that I enjoyed the movie in the cinema but can't review the disc set because of the reasons stated."
2,Turn Brain Off and Be Entertained,"** SPOILER ALERT **While I enjoyed the Blu-Ray Fx experience, I'll have to agree with other reviewers who attempted to apply any kind of logical thought in understanding the premise and outcome of the movie. For example, if the aliens had this voodoo Science capability to permanently 'turn off' technology world-wide, why all the preliminary drama with the threatened genocide. As for the casting, Keanu Reeves took wooden acting to a new level, Jaden Smith is an excruciatingly untalented child actor; obviously the beneficiary of Nepotism, and all the characters wearing a uniform were straight out of a bad saturday morning cartoon. The only cast member who didn't phone it in was Kathy Bates as she singularly avoided being a ridiculous caricature. Aside from all the negativity, the Fx and pacing was sufficient to move it out of the dud category but just barely."
1,The Day the Audience Fell Asleep,"This is quite possibly the most disappointing movie I've ever seen. So much potential, so little effort.What was abundantly clear was that the script was unfinished when they started shooting the film and they never managed to come up with any good story ideas to pad out the running time.Jaden Smith serves no purpose in the film except to prompt audience members to shout ""Will somebody please get that kid off the screen!""Skip this movie. In fact, don't just skip it -- run quickly away from it.They should have released this film on Thanksgiving Day for those who wanted a healthy dose of a big turkey."
2,Disappointing,This could have been an entertaining movie despite its difference from the original 1951 production. But it was totally ruined by the number of film-minutes spent on the emotions of the dumb kid. You feel like strangling the stupid little brat.The story line was weak and even with its special effects it comes in a distant second to the low tech 1951 version. The 1951 film is better written and infinitely better acted and it's story line is logical and powerful. Altogether much more enjoyable. It's a classic that can be viewed over and over again. Unlike the latest rendering which is hardly worth watching once let alone twice.
2,A waste of time,"This remake came to theaters in December. Due to the plethora of bad reviews, there was no way I was going to pay a lot of money to see this in a theater.I rented and watched the DVD recently.I was prepared for a bad movie, but I hoped to be pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately, it was worse than I thought it would be.It sucks big time. The pacing is slow, the characters are shallow, and the story is lame and sloppily written. I would go into more detail, but it pains me to even talk about it. There are several excellent reviews here that do just that.It's an hour and forty minutes of my life that I'll never get back.If you paid to see this in the theater, you have my sympathy."
1,Thanks for Saving Me Pain,"I have been a fan of the classic ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" since I was a little boy and saw it in the theaters. In those days, the big fear was nuclear destruction. If you could get your brain around aliens coming for a visit, it wasn't hard to accept Klaatu and Gort as representatives of a galactic police force here to make us do what we apparently couldn't do for ourselves.I know that directors and story writers take some liberties when a remake is done. The ""War of the Worlds"" remake stayed close enough to the original movie and, by the way, the original novel that it was both a good flick and a well done screen play. Of course that was Spielberg and unfortunately this was not.It's a sad thing to see good talent and a good story maligned and denigrated by a bad writing and poor direction"
3,"Don't be Suprised, just be dissapointed.","Well I've been a super fan of the original 1951 version and was hoping for much more with this one. In a nutshell don't try to remake the best just because you have CG and no ideas in your head. Keanu Reaves and Jennifer Connelly weren't too bad, but having Kathy Bates in a major role(she's such a cow)and the new version of a too-big micro-bug replicator(SG1)-like Gort just didn't cut it. Thank god this included the original version in the box as well and my wife, who never saw it before, was pleasently surprised."
3,"Review of ""like New"" two Disc set","Second disk was not viewable, the sound and picture were terrible and couldn't be watched. The first (main) disk was similar in places, though it was watchable. Certainly not in ""like new"" condition."
2,"the Day the Earth Stood Still,2008","OK,I would have bought this movie so I could have both side by side for comparison ,But,does anyone besides me feel a bit ""SCREWED"" in the fact that they put the original full length version in as an ""EXTRA"" feature on the 2008 Blu-Ray release after having released it a few months back at premium price as a solo Blu-Ray? No reflection on Amizon,but it's not mentioned any where ,on this site or other wise, except on the disc case. does anyone besides me sense a bit of corporate greed on the side of the Studio? For 20th Century Fox.....""0"" stars."
1,Leftist political propaganda,"Given the travesty of making this film just one more instrument of the Hollywood elitist political movement, I'm actually quite surprised they didn't choose an Obama look alike for the part of Klattu. pass on this one big time."
1,Disappointing to a fault,"While the total review carries a 2.5 star score (I checked--it comes out to about 2.59), if you look at the spread, it's canted quite a lot more heavily toward the lower score. I'll spare the world the mathematical descriptor of that, but it is telling. What a disappointment...."
1,Hollywood Should Finally Stand Still,"Unutterably stupid. Hollywood's overpaid dimwit writers, producers, executives and actors should really keep their moronic NewThink to themselves, and leave the Earth alone. Simply one of the worst conceived movies I've seen yet, and that's saying something in this age of 2012 and Spielberg's War of The Worlds. This movie actually thinks it's ending on a happy note, now that after coming face to face with destruction from without, but being saved from ""the brink"" by it's evil ways, humanity will now have to start all over again sans technology. I guess the filmmakers applaud the thinning out of the human race that would quickly take place in such a world. Not enough bad things could be said about this trash. One final word about John Cleese (who has a meaningless cameo)...though once a genius, this now seemingly sad man should retire from the world of entertainment. He no longer entertains."
1,contradictory,"The message behind this film is that humans are dumb and destructive (true, but whatever). Therefore, we obviously morally superior aliens will DESTROY YOU. Ha, ha, that'll show ya. If this isn't the dumbest contradiction ever I don't know what is. The aliens have a vastly superior technology. They can't use this to help save us in addition to the planet? Thanks a lot bozos.The Director's Cut of The Abyss (a good film) also has the exact same message, which is why the Director's Cut is terrible."
2,No Punch,"In 2008 a re-make of The Day The Earth Stood Still was released to theaters.While the original was a warning against nuclear war, this re-make starring Keanu Reeves as the alien Klaatu, serves as a warning against global warming/ecology disruption.This giant sphere comes to New York and Klaatu emerges only to be shot by a lone military man.While under the knife, Klaatu befriends a scientist played by Jennifer Connelly who believes these aliens are friendly.Fat chance. They are here to collect a few specimens and then wipe out mankind.This updated version doesn't have the punch of the original. When you cast Keanu Reeves as your lead, you should know what you're getting yourself into.And GORT, the huge guardian alien has been changed altogether.If you must, just rent this thing for a day."
4,Better than I expected.,I'm usually disappointed with remakes like these -- I really enjoy the originals (nostalgic). But this movie was quite good. :)
1,What a politically correct jumble of a movie!,I watched the newest version first and then the 1951 version right afterward. The 1951 version was so much better!! What a waste of film this was.ugh.
1,Warned but still disappointed,I read all the reviews and was not expecting a good movie. I liked the 1951 version so much I just thought it might still be OK. It wasn't. Even with such low expectations I was disappointed.
5,"not perfect, but good!","overall, its a successful remake. much of the story is changed as it should in any good update. Keanu Reeves is standard here, Jennifer Connelly shines and the film brings up some extremely interesting moral points which helps amplify the great sci-fi aspects. the film rushed its final act, which is a shame since the rest of the film is really quite exceptional. this film is no disaster like many people say, give it a try."
1,OMG - Gort - destroy this movie!,"If you ever needed to see why Hollywood is finished (like the human species of this story) look no further than this absolutely horrible remake of one of the very best of breed 50's sci-fi films. Bad writing, bad casting, bad acting, but most of all some very, very bad directing (worthy of Director's Hell forever-never to return)! I'm speechless that this film was even released to the general theaters - even straight to DVD could not save this rust heap of a movie. My favorite part (other than we really get to see how hollow Keanu Reeves is completely without direction) is the actor who plays T-Bag on Prison Break as the General in charge of the army - oh, and Kathy Bates of the Sec of Defense had me rolling on the floor with laughter - and how can one completely waste a gifted actresses like Jennifer Connelly is beyond me - you simply cannot make this stuff up! It is so bad it does not even rank as a guilty pleasure - and that is very bad!!!"
3,The Day the Lame Earth Stood Still,"I enjoyed the movie to a degree. What a LAME way to push ""Saving the Earth."" What is next, ""The Bride of Frankenstein""? The bride is Gaia Earth and the monster is trying to save her by killing all villagers?Back to the reviewed movie. I believe we-all have a responsibility to care for GOD's Creation( Earth)! BUT! This movie was originally meant to stop man-kind from eventually spreading its poison of ""war"" and ""nuking"" in the future to distant worlds. This movie took a classic Sci-Fi and totally/globally trashed the original concept! - or - Is Hollywood afraid to tackle the real threat to man-kind?"
2,Silly Propaganda,"This profoundly silly movie recasts the nuclear anxiety of the 1950's as environmental anxiety for today. Almost every radical environmentalist position has been blended together into a FX-infused shout: ""watch out, or the planet will get you!"" I don't mean to be snarky about this, but hasn't Keanu overdone the poker face a bit by now? I don't want to say that he can't act, but.... oh well, at least he doesn't act. I was sorry I wasted precious time out of my limited life on Gaia to watch this one!"
2,Some remakes should not be undertaken,"The Day the Earth Stood Still is a thought-provoking, entertaining film - assuming you got the 1951 version starring Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal. What a major disappointment the remake is - an exercise in computer graphics created by a tech weenie on steroids. The arrival of Klaatu's space ship was far more dramatic in the 1951 version, cheesy special effects notwithstanding. And what was the point of Gort suddenly dissolving into a gazillion, tiny, all-consuming bugs? Very unconvincing. The sweet relationship between Klaatu and the boy from 1951 was turned into an adversarial relationship between a killing machine and a smart-ass kid. When the boy came to like Klaatu, I couldn't figure out why. Not worth watching."
3,Keanu steals the show,"I didn,t even know this classic sci-fi movie was remade until I saw it on TV. Then I bought the DVD for 0.99 solely on the basis of Keanu Reeve's portrayal of Klaatu. I wanted to see him play Klaatu again, I thought he was wonderful and fit the part to a tee. However, the chemistry betwen him and the young boy doesn't have the same impact as in the original movie with Michael Rennie."
4,The Day the Earth Stood Still 3 disc Blu-ray,It's amazing movie and i liked so much. Even remake but still look good. Transfer Auido and Picture very amazing than DVD. It's contains 3 disc .. 1 disc remake disc 2 digital copy and 3 old version. But it's upset because old version don't have feature at all. because if the distubutor want can insert the feature in disc 3 because i think more space in blu-ray disc. to bad .. but it's great to have edition because i buy very cheap. thanks amazon
4,good but not great,"I saw this movie because I'm a big fan of the original. I thought it was good, but not great. I tend to feel that the remakes are never as good as the original. If you give it a chance and rate it on its own merits, forgetting the original, I think its an enjoyable movie."
4,Picky Picky,"I don't know exactly what some reviewers expected from this movie, but it really isn't as bad as some would have you believe. It is certainly not the thought provoking film the original 1951 edition was. But if you want a couple of hours of destruction whilst filing away a certain sense of head shaking critical judgement this is a perfectly acceptable world wrecking piece of work I give 2 1/2 to 3 stars. I don't mind the zen approach Keanu takes here; he is a bloody inscrutable alien. Some have asked how people can be as stupid as the authorities shown in this movie and I reply: yes, they are that stupid. Look at the world around you. And by the way, this special three disc blu-ray edition contains includes the original 1951 Robert Wise movie restored to blu-ray quality. That alone brings the whole package up to four stars if not five."
1,How bad...,"Bad enough to say that I got it for free and plan on giving it away. The casting was horrible, Will Smiths son cannot act, period! They had the chance to make a remake of the original and made garbage. Dont waste your time or money on this movie. It will rank in the top five of the worst remakes ever made. Hollywood if your listening, try again. The original was great. I could pick apart this movie bit by bit about things and sequences that didn't make sense. I will not waste your time. THIS MOVIE SUCKED!!!"
4,Try it anyway! You may like it! I did!,"I never seen the original version. So I may not be as critical. It is really a good popcorn movie. The X-files sequel movie should have been done in such a scale. Loved it. FX was eye candy but I really thought that the basic premise of the movie was engaging. The only thing they could have done a little better was to develop further more why the alien decided to change his mind about humanity. The scene was short and sweet to help the alien see the better side of humanity but not enough for me to believe the alien. There were 2 other scenes that helped the alien to change his mind but they were barely mentioned toward the end. Little bit of apocalyptic feel to it but overall very intriguing storyline. Despise the harsh review, just watch it for the fun of it all...one of better sci-fi I have seen recently..."
3,certainly could have been better but worth seeing,"This movie could have been much better in a lot of ways. Parts of it were really good and I can definitely see our gov't trying to think their in charge in situation like this. But the movie missed on so many other ways. They made Klatu have very little personality, Gort was a giant like he was going to fight Transformers or something. Jennifer Connelly actually was pretty good in this. This was worth seeing and not a 1 star movie. So many people berate a movie if its not better than the original. Just take it for what it is. The original movie had its flaws too - Klatu was too human-acting and Gort was too mechanical."
2,My opion,The seller was very prompt in mailing the blue ray that I purchased but I was dissapointed in the movie. I did not think it was all that great. it's not the sellers fault. I do appreciate his timely matter on mailing it to me.
2,The Day the Earth Stood Still,The movie was OK. I liked the original version better as it had more of a political statement. This version's political statement was very indirect (that we are ruining the world) and the actions aren't very clear that we should take.
2,I don't Get It.,"This movie could have been so much better. I hate to say it but even when you know what it was about, it left you wondering what did you expect mankind to do when a apperantly hostile force invades Earth. I don't think the people of Earth saw the frist movie. It just left me wondering, are we that bad to our planet, excuse me his planet ?? I give it 2 Klaatus for nice effects."
1,No Oscar for Keanu or Klaatu,"On the plus side this is a TOP 25 selling Blu ray disc.But.............on the negative side it has some of the worst reviews ever.Like this one. So to save you the effort of reading all the 1 and 2 star reviews (and there are many) here goes:Don't BOTHER with this horrid, terribad, crapfest of a dumbed-down computer animation. It is an absurd, anticlimactic, mediocre, emotionless, boring, pestilence of a movie.Thanks you reviewers - you said it all!"
1,Stupidest movie ever!!!,This movie was THE worst movie i've ever sat down and watched. It was a good idea gone bad if ya ask me!Keanu Reeves needs to be more careful with the role's he chooses to play. The whole thing is basicly about a alien in the form of a human that comes to earth to destroy it but changes his mind in a not so dramatic ending. Overall this movie was STU-PID!!!!
1,Ugh,"Soul-less drivel devoid of character development.Continuity errors galore.Mind-numbingly bad acting.This trainwreck of a film has it all!I wanted to like it.Instead, I found myself rooting for the nanobots."
3,Day the Earth Stood Still (Three-Disc) [Blu-ray],"I watched the original in England about 30 odd years ago , and re-watched it only a couple of months ago. After watching the re-hashed version on blu-ray yesterday, I thought it wasn't as bad as quite a lot of people made it to be, but it also could never be a classic either. Overall, the new movie was based on a badly written script, and towards the end it was as if the director himself lost interest, given the abrupt ending. The role of the kid was totally un-necessary and it kind of drag the movie a bit. I love sci-fi movies that kind of make you think ( as the original was ), but the new version was more a mindless entertainment common today."
2,"some good visuals, but weaker overall","Ive never seen the b&w original so I wont compare the two. Yes some of the scenes w/ the special fx are good, but overall I thought the movie was just too rushed and there was no character development. The story felt kind of empty. Disappointed"
1,the day the earth stood still,Was not able to view the movie the bluray was freezing up and had scratches. It only had one disc also not the 3 disc special edition like stated. I was really dissapointed and wish that they would send a working bluray i purchess alot of films and will continue to do so in the future just wish people would do good business and that way I could continue to buy more films in the future. sincerly Mr. Stone
2,Psycho Eco Movie- Give Me a Break!,"The pros are that the movie is made well and acting is great. The story line came from Al Gore's oversized SUV I think. The aliens are coming to try and save the earth from who else? Evil humans..evil because we tell lies or are morally degenerate? Well, not exactly...because we have power (i.e. electricity)..which seems to be very hurtful. So the fix is the bring destroying insects..which only destroy humans..but the savior turns out to be Keenu alien, and his grace and mercy allowing us to 'change'..and how he comes up with this is unique.. I guess, just like taxes will save the planet,ya know!"
1,Wish I could give zero stars!,"Remember when I mentioned about about 'Eagle Eye', and how I couldn't believe how much time & energy were spent on something so bad? Ditto here, but with even lower results. I'm one of the few that actually likes Keanu Reeves as an actor, and most of the movies. But this is dreadful stuff, and even Jennifer Connelly can't make this redeeming. Oh, and especially annoying was Jaden Smith (Will Smith's son)."
1,Why Did They Bother !!!,"Can someone please explain to me why Hollywoodfeels that it just has to remake classic movies?You think they would have learned fromother disasterous remakes such as The Thing,Fail Safe,Invasion of the Body Snatchers or The Manchurian Candidate.This movie is so-o-o-obad that it's hard to know where to begin.Let's try the beginning.The original movie immediatelyset the viewer up that something was coming,by having weird music playing during the openingcredits.It created anticipation and suspense right off the bat which is something that was totally lacking throughout the remake.Boring does not begin to touch on what was wrong with this movie.I kept on waiting for SOMETHING tohappen,but it never did.The biggest sin was of course not hearing those special words ""Gort,Klaatu Barada Nikto"".I guess the next disasterous remake will beThe Boys From Brazil.(heaven help us)P.S. The special effects on this movie stank."
1,As bad as it gets,"Decided to rent it from my public library - I'm SO glad it was only $1. In a nutshell - an intelligent alien species decides the earth needs to be rid of dumb humans to save the planet and their frontman (Keanu) have a change of heart because of a whiny kid (talk about being unintelligent). I watched the original many times and this is a disgrace to the original. After watching this movie, you almost wish the aliens would wipe it out so we wouldn't have to bear sitting through such trash. Everyone involved in making this movie (including the kid) needs to be shot into deep space."
2,"""Day"" remake a disappointment","While the special effects were impressive, this remake was not very good. Even the talent of Keanu Reeves and Kathy Bates couldn't save this movie from being pretty bland. To be fair, it would be nearly impossible to top the original 1951 film, and this new version fails to draw the viewer in. The original movie's alien came to warn earth of the consequences, should the violence occurring on earth extend into space. In the new movie, Keanu Reeves' alien comes not to warn, but to destroy mankind in order to save the earth itself. Have to say, I found myself pulling for the earth, and hoping the alien WOULD save the earth, and not man. Oh well."
2,The Day the Earth Stood Still,"GDeed special effects did nothing for the story. Lacked the mystery of the original. For those ino scifi, BIG disappointment."
1,..what a flop...the original is still the best,This was such waste of production..great new special effects....keanu...does have any real lines....he more intelligent words in ted and bills bogus adventure....and too top off injury to insult...this movie ends with nothing............just drops off cliff.....stupid.makes the viewer to do likewise....thank god i saw this at home where..i could stop the dvd..........plus the over message of global warming non sense..remake movies have been real junkers....
4,4 stars,"There are a lot of mixed reviews on this film, so I didn't know what to expect, but I enjoyed it. But I guess I am a little partial to Keanu Reeves! I thought the effects were great and the story was moving. So what, if it's not the best of the best...it's still a good movie with some great actors. I for one am glad I didn't listen to the negative revews and took a chance."
1,Can't believe I wasted my money,I didn't think it would be great but I had hoped it would be good. It wasn't. Save your cash and pass
4,It wasn't that bad...,"I've been a non-conforming artist type since I was a kid so my liking this movie while the so-called ""average"" masses hate it seems typical of me. I went in with very low expectations based on all the reviews I read. I was pleasantly surprised. I liked this movie a lot. The only thing I'd change is the giant Robot type thing would step on the kid. God, what an annoying little dick!"
2,A mix of the original and Starman,"The remake should have stuck more to the original. Why ""Starman"" was mixed in is beyond me-they had such potential with Gort, and, frankly blew it!"
2,The Day The Movie Industry Made A Brainwash Movie,"This movie was pure brainwasing about the enviorment, it was absolute nonesense,it was a complete waste of a golden opprotunity to remake a great movie and make it better, the only thing good about it was jennifer connelly."
5,Very Good Movie and much better than i expected.,"I started not to buy this movie after all the negative reviews,But i am very glad i did.It was as good as the original but with the special effects that made it even better.Even though the story line was very similar to the original movie,they made changes to modernize this version.Don't believe all the negative reviews,this movie is very under Rated and had a good ending."
1,Only redeeming feature...the original version is included.,"This movie is a crapfest of epic proportions. Wow, it is bad. The only good thing about this release is the inclusion of the original film. So watch the original version and forget the Keanu Reeves version was ever created. How sad, because I love Jennifer Connely."
1,no responce from dealer,I am very unhappy that I purchased this product. I made a mistake and purchased a blu-ray disc which I cannot use. I did not receive a three-disc edition; I did not hear from the company on how they could correct my error. So I will not deal with them every again.
4,Good sequel,"Liked the update with color,clever use of some of the nomeclature from the original, but the original is still my favorite."
1,green as Gore,"They had to put a reference to the destruction of earth by man in order to be Green as Gore. How stupid people are to accept this rubbish about man made global warming and pollution from the industral revolution.The useful idiots of Marxism at work again.""Yuri Besmenov, YouTube video."""
1,pretty boring,Like the rest of the reviews I found this movie pretty bad. Maybe its because i've seen the orginal so much but the acting was so poor. Its like they all new it was created for the special effects. Its just a slow paced poor re-make.
1,"Last time I do unbox, This is A garbage service.","I have had nothing but problems with this thing from the beginning. After not being able to uninstall it or upgrade it or watch my movies I gave up about a year ago. Today, after a long day of headaches and problems at work I thought I would do something easy...haha. I decided to rent this movie and watch it. I have since built a new computer so I had re download unbox, then rented it but hey, it doesn't show up. I can't see it in my library and have no way to actually watch the movie I paid 4 dollars in rent to watch. So, my headache is bigger and I am as fed up with the claims of unbox as it gets. I will never use UNBOX EVER AGAIN."
1,Worst remake ever,"Don't waste your money, buy the original w/ true actors; Michael Rennie & Patricia Neal.They might as well called the alien Keanu, rather than Klaatu. He sleepwalks through the role. Gort the robot has more personality.The plot lacks believable emotion, sequencing & substance. The special effects are awful. Gort the robot looks like a carton animation. The original movie's message was a warning that our nuclear weapons pose a threat to the peaceful planets of the universe. This turkey of a remake uses the enviro wacko theme that all human life must be eradicated to save the earth from itself.Why bother to have actors. Have 90 minutes of Gort's Death Ray torching the earth. Better yet, make Keanu play the part of Gort. Dude!"
1,yawn!,"Even with all the fancy SFX, the big explosions, the dramaticepic music score, the thrilling ""we have to evade the agents"" chase sequences,......I was still bored out of my skull!!!There is not one shred of originality in this remake. Hell, giveme the 1951 version anytime over this one. At least I'd enjoy the novelty of watching classic cinema.Another note, Keanu Reeves has got to be the world's worst actor!I've seen more talent in a retail store mannequin. I kid you not!"
4,Good Remake,"I was pleasantly sursprised by this remake of the older classic. Keanu Reeves did his part justice and most of the story line was still there. The only thing I was disappointed in was the ending. I wish it didn't just cut off like it did. It left one feeling like ""what just happened, is that how they part forever""?Regina Maxin"
3,How green was my planet or save whales please!,What can I say other than I am a great fan of the original movie TDTESS. This sad excuse for a remake of a true SciFi classic left me disappointed. Although I like Keanu Reeves I felt he was to cold for the role of Klaatu and as for Jaden Smith I was irritated to distraction by this thankless brat. Jenifer Conally what a waste.Not to totally abandon any hope for this movie I will say the effects were of a high standard also the supporting cast was impressive if not under developed. Finally let me say I am fed up with the save the earth theme and think I will vomit the next time I see it used in such a cheesy way. Give us all a break Green Peace.There are still nuclear nightmares out there and a dozen other scenarios to considerso lets get original. There I feel better!
2,fair,The original was better. When I purchased the movie I thought widescreen was a full movie screen. Not half a screen.
1,And I thought that the remake of War of the Worlds was bad...,"Some of the most appealing qualities of the original were completely downplayed by this remake, which preferred to focus on FX rather than the process through Klatuu realizes how complex and conflicted us earthlings are. Realizing that our potential for destruction was matched by an even bigger potential for doing good ultimately motivates him to sacrifice his own life in order to give us another chance. Not that these aspect don't exist in the new version, I just do feel that making this more of an action movie with loads of special effects was higher in the producers priority list.And the fact that we don't get to hear Klatuu Barada Niktu, is just the last nail in the coffin."
2,The Day the Earth stood still - NEW,I was very disappointed in this movie. The original is one of my favorites and this remake was not interesting at all.
2,"""The Day A Movie Stood Still""","After a long & anticiapate wait for the release of this movie, once again Hollywood didn't disapoint me with another boring, computer-generated special effects filled movie (no acting required). This movie was about as dead as the role played by Reeves, who never did awake from his travels in time to save Earth from destruction. If you can't sleep one night, put this movie on and you will sleep soundly!!"
3,It's a SO SO DAY,The acting is okay. Some scenes are curiosity provoking.The special effects look very much like a video game. I mean most of them look fake. I expect them to be better.
4,A great value for your money,"Ignore what you think about the new film. For the price of the single Blu-Ray movie, you also get a digital copy along with a Blu-Ray copy of the original '50s film.With those two extra discs, you're looking at a value of $35. I commend 20th Century Fox for creating a wonderful edition of a not-so-good movie."
3,Good Effort.,"I'm a fan of emotionless acting, and Keanu does it well. There are some interesting scenes and visuals, can't say more without spoilers but photography is very nice, even the nightshots look great.My only complaint is that there isn't really much in this movie. I mean lots of scientists are introduced in some secene but 2 minutes later we don't see any of them anymore. None of the characters are developed right, for example the General, or the Defence Secretary, left standing without any backstory, or any story for that matter.I don't know, maybe I was expecting too much. I would say rent it before buying."
3,It's not so bad.,"I see a lot of bad comments in here about this film, and while some of them are valid, I think others are a little extreme. I liked the first rendition of this film because the characters seemed more realistic. I did not like Smith as the child, and I think it is mostly because the role itself was written poorly. I think Keanu did a fine job with the type of character he was portraying. The effects were amazing and the message was solid. The same, clearly, as the first...and in this time much more relevant."
3,Fans of the original Michael Rennie classic need not apply.,"This movie is recycled popcorn fare with an ""earth first"" theme that casts Keanu Reeves once again in a savior role (that guy should be careful or he'll get a complex), wastes Jennifer Connelly in her lead role as some micorbiologist scientist, and tries to be fresh with a Noah's ark theme. It's passable because there are some nice moments in the movie (like with Keanu's Klaatu is being interviewed) and Reeves, known for cardboard performances, is perfectly cast here but don't expect much beyond contrivance. Passable for a couple bucks."
3,Wanted more scenery,There was a lot of repetition in this DVD. We saw the same footage repeatedly throughout the whole series. I would have preferred more villages and scenery than was shown.
3,"Repetitive, Repetitive, Repetitive","If you are looking for a tour of Cornwall and its wonderful remote views and paths unknown to the average tourist - this is not it! The eight episodes are more of an advertisement for various aspects of touring possibilities - a winery, a campsite, a rental agency, Mousehole, and a few other spots. Each episode repeats exactly what went on in the prior episode.... all in all - lovingly made with a nice feeling about the Cornish folk - but we all know that already - and really would have liked to see more of the geographic and architectural treasures and have much less repetition. Not worth $40.00!"
2,Strong in Core & Weak in Windows,"I took the test last month (Dec '99). (scored 90% on DOS/WIN and 98% on Core). I realized that the book went into great detail on stuff that wasnt needed for the exam and didnt cover enough of stuff that was on the exam. The book was especially weak in the Win95 section. The Core section was good tho. If you are not strong in Windows (especially troubleshooting), you definately need another book."
3,Overview - Not enough detail,"This book provided an overview of most of the topics covered but did not go into detail on much of the information that was needed, especially Windows/DOS half. Not bad on Core. I would recommend shopping for a book on Amazon by reading the reviews before buying the lowest price one that I saw. It wasn't worth it, because the same info in the book is available on the net, and there are a lot of practice tests online."
2,Not a good book.,"This book is not a very good book to use to prepare for the exam, it makes good review but, but still it is lacking alot of key elements that is asked on the test. I would not recommend this book to anyone, not even an enemy."
1,"""Wednesday"" sewn upside-down","1. The word ""Wednesday"" was sewn upside-down.2. I agree with other reviewers who say fabric appears flimsy/cheap.3. I would have returned it but we were past the return window."
1,No shoe rack ob the back or sides.,I ordered two of these. One had shoe slots for shoes on the side and back. The other one had none. Try explaining this to a 4 and 5 year old. Why does mine not have a place for shoes? Good question!
4,good enough,It is good.. holding quite a lot weight till now. Would be better if a harder material is provided at the top to prevent bending.
4,Very functional.,"Fits in the closet well! Love the days of the week labels, and the extra storage pockets on each side. Once I got it I was so excited, I started organizing and trying to find things to fill it up. My kids are a little too small to use it yet but it will be great for the days when Daddy gets them ready!"
4,Nice product,"This is a very nice product to keep your kids closet organised. I use it in my preschooler's closet. Although I wish they used something else to hold the compartments. My product has a strip of cardboard in it and one of them broke easily while my daughter was attempting to reach a higher shelf. Other than that, I like it because its useful and looks fun and colorful."
1,terrible,Looks cute and functional. After taking out of plastic covering smelled strongly of mold and mildew. Overpowering unable to remove with frebreez and airing out in garage for days.
2,it sags over time,"I've had this organizer for about 3 years now. the color is great and the storage is nice.while i think it is a great idea and worked very well initially, it sagged over time. maybe i put too many things into the shelves, but it has become very bent from where it is hanging. i think the hanger is hanging from one point hook, and would have lasted much longer and hold up better if it were completely sewn in across the top. look for something that will not sag instead of this one."
5,Love it!!,Nice to have for the kids! I've made a morning routine chartAnd fill it with a weeks worth of clothes. Does the job!
4,Very sophisticated - not for everyone,"One of the problems with books about Asian religion is that people want easy answers and pop spirituality. If that is what you are looking for, this book is definitely not for you. Rather, it is a very sophisticated examination of the cult of Lu Dongbin, a popular Daoist immortal who has been worshipped in China for many hundreds of years. The book traces different expressions of this worship, including scriptures and temple paintings, and connects the worship of Lu Dongbin with larger questions in the study of religion and the history of China. The only reason I give this book four stars is that it is quite technical, and those with no background might find it difficult."
5,Great machine for comparatively low price!,"I bought this machine more than three years ago. I absolutely love it. It was my first, and only, espresso machine. I did weeks of research and obsessed about which brand and model to buy. I finally settled on the Syncrony Compact because it was small, had a by-pass doser, was a well-respected brand, and was in the cheaper price range for a super auto. It took a couple of days to get used to exactly how to use it, but I knew there would be a learning curve. I have had absolutely no problems with this machine. It makes great espresso every day for me and my husband. I love using it for guests as everyone is impressed at what I can make in my own kitchen. As long as you remember to descale every so often, it'll put out one great shot after another. I highly recommend this machine!"
1,Not live,I ordered this cd twice and each time the cd case said live the picture on the cd said live. this was not a live cd and the songs on the cd were not the ones listed on the cd. I returned the cd for another copy it too was not live and the songs although not the same on the 1st cd was not live. I saw the William Harts Delfonic last night at Soul jam and they stole the show i would love to have this cd Live
2,Oxford Reverse Dictionary,"I though I was ordering a ""Reverse-order"" dictionary (like the one the USAF did). I wanted to study suffixes in words, for example. What I got was a Thesaurus type ""fields"" dictionary. It wasn't what I wanted."
4,"Great variations, worth the price too",I will really recommend this book for kids who are learning English and can already ready by themselves. Good stuff
5,I swear by this book!,"I have to say that as far as ""diet"" books go- this is the best one out there. A lot of the books just talk about how much weight people have ""lost"" and what have you, but this one actually explains how the body works and you can understand how you're losing weight. Every time I pick it up I learn something completely new. It's pretty brief, however. I think there needs to be a second edition with about 100 more pages."
2,Didn't last,"bases disintegrated in less than one year - bleached out and fell into pieces. They were stored in an outdoor sports bin out of the sun, too. The ball is cracked and discolored with mildew and mold - also stored in the bin."
2,Cheap Set,Since I couldn't upgrade shipping on this I took a chance and didn't have it by when I needed it so I went to sporting goods store and for same money got bases and actual kickball and it was 10 times nicer than this one. This was basically a volleyball and cheap bases in a bag I could fit into.
2,Graffiti Verite' A presentation of L.A. area graffiti,Graffiti Verite showcases the graf movement in Los Angeles and the surrounding areas. This video is A good first step as A introduction but Graffiti Verite 2 should also be purchased to complete the story. A must for any video collection!
3,"Simple and straightforward, but too short","Do not purchase this product if you have figured out the basics already. There is nothing new here for you. However, if you are just getting on Vegas, this will make a very simple and basic companion. Much more depth is needed, and could have been added - there was so much time left on the DVD - for someone who has even a rudimentary understanding of video or audio editing software."
2,Some good info but too outdated,"This book has some valuable information in it, but it's a bit outdated. I'm now living in Korea and everyone has a smart phone or Samsung Galaxy Note and Koreans use Facebook. The book was published before there were smart phones and Facebook. This is relevant as in ten years time Koreans advance more than many other countries. They adopt technology quickly and it's a huge part of their culture now."
4,Useful is you plan to teach and work with Koreans,"At first I thought this would be a big generalization of people so I took it lightly, but there are some truths in it. Pay attention especially to the parts about communication."
3,Korean Cohesion,"A useful book but he could give us much more about the group activities there such as the incredible networks of alumni associations, incessant reunions and the national love of gossip."
2,Pentagon hit by airplane,"This video is worth purchasing and viewing. It is not too long and it is easy to understand. There is, however, one huge gaffe in it. The video shows no remnants of any airplane in the Pentagon after the September 11, 2001 attack. Undoubtedly that is correct, but the video draws the incorrect conclusion that no airplane could have hit the Pentagon. One former pilot who knows more than I do said that if a jet hit a massive building like the Pentagon at several hundred miles an hour, there wouldn't be much left of the airplane. So the fact that we can't see the remnants of any airplane in the video means nothing, because we shouldn't expect to see any remnants either. Nonetheless, this video makes some interesting observations."
3,"David , this makes no sense.","David, where are all the people who died on the planes that crashed, If the planes that crashed in to World Trade center weren't Commercial Airliners? Doesn't make any sense? If no commercial airliners crashed into the buildings, than no one flying on those airliners would be dead right?The fact that you never even brought this up in your movie is the 1 major suspicion I had with the whole thing.To suggest the government flew non commercial planes into buildings is fine ,, but people did die in commercial planes that day. No answer for that, Didnt bring that point up?Throws the whole video off."
3,Good but...,"I saw this recently and to be honestly, I was a little bit disappointed. I was relieved that it avoided the obviously slanted points of view presented in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" as well as the numerous right-wing counters but there is a reason it did this. It makes no claims whatsoever. At one point, the narrator says something along the line of ""numerous people will try to refute the claims that we are making in this film."" This could not possibly happen because no claims are made. There is a disclaimer at the beginning that tells the viewer that he or she is left to make their own conclusions about the information presented but the problem is, there really isn't a whole lot in this film that you couldn't have gotten from even the mainstream news."
4,í ám bad at titles,"Either you don't know them or you love them. Seam made some brilliant records, especially ""the problem with me"" is just near perfection. When I picked up ""the pace is glacial"" I had high expectations but still I feel there are left some weaknesses on this one. Personally I don't think Sooyoung Park is a good singer-he sings quite a lot on this one- but he can whisper very well. Luckily there are good, VERY very good songs on this disk (number 6 and 9) so it was worth the money. If you never heard of SEAM I suggest you buy one of the older albums first cause Seam is a very good band."
