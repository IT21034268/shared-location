1,Will Not Work On Six My Six Volt Cars,"I bought this to use on my 6 volt Ford Flathead car, I followed the instructions and used a 12 volt battery, it would not work the & digital readouts went crazy, so I used a modern coil wire in the distributor per instructions, still no good, I tried wrapping the timing light in aluminum foil,still no good. I tried it on my modern car and it worked fine, but I need one for my 6 volt car with points and copper core wires. I do not need one for my modern car, so I returned it to Amazon with no problems and got a full refund very fast. it is a nice timing light at a very good price but just not for my 6 volt cars."
4,Great Tool!,I've had several timing lights over the years and for the price this one is unbeatable! I would recommend this item to anyone upgrading from a standard timing light!
1,"Advertised as 6 conductor, actually only 4",I bought this under the assumption then because the item title said '6 conductor' it actually would be. As you can see by my rating - not so much. It's only a 4 conductor coupler and it's a different brand. Stay away from this seller.
5,Awesome!,"This is one of my favorite CDs. I just bought a 2nd one because my other one is skipping. Many days are started by listening to ""One More Day"" and then ""Can't Nobody Do You Like Jesus"" first. Then I play the CD from the beginning!"
5,great album; great service,"I've listened to this album for years on cassette tape, but when my tape broke I had to upgrade. LOL! This a great live recording and Amazon made it so easy to purchase. And it was the cheapest!"
5,Great Album!,"I love this album! It's so nice to be able to carry my DVD's around without the bulkier cases.I will say this: I wish it provided better for 2disc sets, and I wish that all the inserts fit into it. The latter is not the fault of CaseLogic, however, and it is rather the responsibility of the studios- COME ON Warner Brothers, GET WITH IT!- to provide inserts that will accomodate the album. At least inserts that are somewhat similar to the rest of the industry's inserts. At least inserts, period. Geez....Caselogic is my preferred media storage company, and I love their products. This album is no exception, and I highly recommend it to anyone with any kind of DVD collection."
2,Poor customer policy,"My experience purchasing the battery was not a good one. I was sent the wrong battery and called the company that sent it. They sent me a return label and I immediately returned it, expecting them to send the prper battery as it was their mistake. I waited about 10 days for a new battery, so I called the company and they informed me I would have to reorder thru Amazon. I waisted about three weeks in this process."
1,Too many errors,"There are too many errors in ch 3. I don't think the author checked them carefully. If you don't know the tricks, you never get them run. It is painful."
3,Nice idea. Poor implementation.,"I agree with Dan Green. The author has a hard enough job putting his work together, let alone fixing every typo. That's the publishers job. As far as I am concerned Maneesh Sahu has been let down by would-be vanity publisher QUE. There are typos galore and just too many code errors. It's as if QUE printed the wrong draft. I am just glad I am an experienced enough developer to see around the bugs. This work has the potential to rank amongst the better jsp books. Buy it if you have some programming skills, but still expect problems. Else get Web Development with Java Server Pages by Duane K. Fields and Mark A. Kolb. To quote Dan Green, ""QUE get it together""..."
4,A good book to understanding & applying jsp1.1 specification,"JSP from scratch is a very lucid book which gave me a good grasp of JSP1.1 specification....illustrating j2ee technologies like javabeans, custom tld, javamail, ejbs and jdbc. The book is not only very informative i.e. theoritically but also real cool..providing practical examples demonstrated while building an auction site. Understanding and adapting the framework provided was real easy inspite of the fact I was using BEA Weblogic 5.1 instead of Apache's Tomcat. I also liked the writing style which veered away from the typical hand-holding of those books for dummies and the arcane jargons of the complicated reference bibles. All in all a very decent book...a thumbs up from my end"
2,Good Intent but is Content checked?,"I thought the whole purpose of this book is to teach one in working with JSP. However, I'm only on the 3rd Chapter and I have spent a fairly good amount of time trying to debug the sample codes and piece together what the author is trying to get at. It's a good thing I'm an experienced programmer and good at debugging, otherwise I would have thrown my hands up in exasperation long ago.What the book is trying to achieve is good (that was why I bought it) but if the rest of the chapters and the sample codes are going to be as buggy as the first few chapters, I don't think the author is going to convince many readers into using JSP through his efforts."
1,Java Server Pages From Scratch,"I was truly amazed and flabbergasted at the other reviewers who gave this book more than one star! This book stinks! Why, you ask? Any beginner that starts going through the exercises will soon find that there are LOTS of problems. I am a 20 year I.S. veteran and I could not figure out some of the problems in the examples. It was obvious that no one did a quality check on this book and Que should be embarrassed. I have sent several messages to Que support but have not received any updated example code. The Que support person even promised to send me another book of my choice, but, even after several weeks it hasn't arrived.So, I am very disappointed and wish I would have read the Amazon reviews before I wasted my money. Shame on Que and Sahu."
2,Good Try...Irresponsible writing...,"This book is very well architected and has the potential of being a great teaching tool...But there are so so so many typos and faults with the example code that it seems the publisher was more interested in getting the book out and making money than creating a quality product...Very dissapointing...""QUE get it together""..."
1,Return to sender.,"I recently purchased this book on an impulse from a local retailer. After struggling through the first 3 chapters I decided to look at the Amazon reviews of the book. I reiterate what the earlier reviewers said. The book is so full of errors it's obvious the author wasn't paying attention. Not only does the code in the book skip, jump and disappear between each example, but the code on the included CD is as bad. Poor effort by the Author, poor effort by QUE. Good effort by my retailer who took the book back."
2,Too Poorly Written to Follow,"This book holds great potential but was unsuccessful at teaching ""JSP from scratch"". I agree with one of the previous posts that you have to know JSP to follow this book. Starts off too elementary and then thrusts you into great technical jargon. The transition from basic instruction to advanced instruction is missing."
1,one of the worst books I have ever read,"This book has so many errors that if you do not know java well you will not get anywhere with the code. The concept of the book is all right but the code examples have to be fixed and put together. If you want to learn JSP, DO NOT buy this book."
2,A copy?,"Seems this map is a copy of a city map published in 1994 by another publisher... However, it's nothing special, and the usual free maps you get at the tourist information are far better than this one you have to pay for"
3,GOOD BUT SHORT,"This book is quite good for beginners, cause it gives a good introduction both in chords ( open chords are explained in this book ) and in solo-playing, and the CD is of great help. The songs also are quite nice. But what I found irritating about it, is that there are too few exercises: it is simply too short!!!"
1,USB Multi Port,"Received Multi Port on about August 4, 2010. Needed more ports for laptop. Have 3 ports on laptop (ACER Aspire 5100), one side and two rear. Plugged in (loaded with 4 USB lines) to one of rear ports and several days later the rear ports stopped working. Took to authorized service station and they feel the rear ports were fried due to the laptop ports having to power the Multi port unit. Stated in ad that no external power source was needed and none was supplied (although it looks like a socket is on the MultiPort for one). Price was marked down from 29.99 to 9.99 so I didn't even bother with a return request. Bought a 7 port with external power supply from local dealer and have it plugged into remaining good laptop port. Got what I paid for I guess."
4,Good little device for the money,"This hub can be used wtih a laptop or desktop computer. Came with a 6 foot cable that has a y-splitter which can be used together or separately. The Black input is used for power and data. The red provides power only (optional) and should be used if you attach high power devices such as printers or external drives. The only drawback to this is that you need to have 2 available usb ports. The device is automatically recognized when plugged in so there is no need to install drivers. Good little device for the money and is small enough to fit into a laptop carry case. I would have given a 5 star, but I did not like that you need 2 usb ports."
3,Not USB 2,"Just started using it, everything just about fine and dandy except it is not USB 2 compatable. Part of the reson I bought it is because I thought it was (said so in the tech specs) but it doesn't seem to work, or at least it gives out warnings (Win XP).But for this price its still not bad and it turns out I can rearange some stuff so USB 1 is sufficient for me at the moment."
1,I'm not satisfied,"I'm not satisfied, because the Targus 4-Port USB 2.0 Ultra Mini Hub PA055U (Black) is not the same in the picture that they send it to me, and there is no box and instruction of this item, he only use plastic to place the item, I receive the item in 2 days, so the shipping is good and fast, the one that I receive is not the same logo and shape, that's all, Thank you"
2,USB1.1 and no power adapter,This is a nice little hub but lacks USB2.0 and also its would have been nice to have a power adapter.
5,Solved my problem,"Simple, straightforward, works beautifully -- that's what a product should do and that's what this one does. It solved my problem of turning my iMac to access to the available USB port for cameras, iPods, etc."
3,"Kind of does the job, but not all I was hoping for","I know my title is a little cliché, but that really is how I feel about it. My wife got this dumb PC that doesn't have USB ports on the front and the way we have our PC it really isn't that convenient to get to the back to access the USB ports, so I bought this one to run up the front so I don't have to dig in the back every time. It works ok for most items, but not one that I really use a lot--our portable hard drive. I'm not sure why--maybe I purchased the wrong product or need a power adapter for it, but it wasn't clear to me in the instructions. I'd probably have given 5-stars if it worked, but for this, I'm dinging a couple stars and only giving 3-stars."
3,"Eh, not bad","There's nothing too fancy about this little hub but it does the job. I thought the blue lights would be exciting but they turned out to be the most annoying feature since I can't get three of them to stop blinking when a device is attached. The manual is sparce and doesn't mention why this happens nor can I find any info on the Targus website, either. It has a flat side which makes it easy to mount under my work desk and keep clutter down a little. There are better choices out there but I made mine and I'll keep it for a while."
1,Dies after three days; get Belkin,I hooked this up on a Thursday night and worked well but Sunday morning I got up and it was dead. The device lights up to say it has power but no device connected to it worked. I attempted to find help on Targus' website but there is no help at all. So I unplugged the Hub from the computer and then plugged it back in. The computer then does not even recognize it. I plugged it into another computer and it still had no clue what the device was. This is the second Hub I've bought made by Targus. I won't buy another Targus product. I just purchased a Belkin and it works perfect.
4,Great hub - just a few minor issues.,"PROSSmallCuteSelf-powered - comes with a power adaptor. I have 6 devices hooked up to it, including 2 USB Hard Drives, and it works fine without the adapter - a big plus for me. Most hubs would not work with this setup.USB 2.0 & 1.1 - 6 devices hooked up, 3 low speed and 3 high speed, all work very well.Runs cool.CONSNot sure why, but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and power/uplink ports on the other. This is dumb. If you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward. All ports should be on the back and leds on the front. Here, the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you don't see them.The hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated.Overall, the best hub I've ever had and I tried many."
5,It's called the Ultra Mini for a reason!,"This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub.The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately.In short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk."
5,Targus PA055U 4 Port USB 2.0,"I ordered a Targus 4 Port USB 2.0 and it works Great. Because with the shortages of USB Port in the back of my computer, it was very difficult to get at them when I needed them, this give me the option of always having a port available. Excellent Idea."
4,"A nice, basic hub","There are definitely fancier hubs out there, but what this Targus hub perhaps lacks in beauty, it certainly makes up for in performance. I've found it to work without issue. Good product."
5,Simple Solution that Works,"This handy little hub puts my USB ports right where I need them. It's an excellent solution for use with a laptop because it's ultra light and portable. It also works well if your desktop's USB ports are all on the back side of the tower. It's a simple, cost-effective solution."
1,Poor Reliability,"Stopped working for reasons unbeknownst to me in less than 60 days.Simple product, poorly on reliability."
2,Computer Hangs with Targus PA055 USB Hub,"The concept is great, use one USB port on the back to connect to the Targus USB Hub, and then from there you can plug in four additional USB devices.The problem I had with my Win98 SE machine, was when the Targus USB Hub was attached at bootup, my PC would not boot at all. Unplug the connection (either from hub itself or back of PC) and the computer boots fine. Once up, I can reconnect the USB cable to the Hub and use all connected devices, but then I have to unplug before shutdown or right before start-up which is a pain in the arse.Hey, if you have a solution, then email me at wilkc@yahoo.com."
5,Very efficient hub,I have had one the these Targus USB 4-port hubs for so long I can't remember when I bought it. It is plugged into the front of my desktop and has never let me down.I am about to order another for my new laptop.Bobby
1,Not that good,"I'm not happy with the Targus 4-port USB 2.0 ultra mini hub. It works with some plugs but other ones have a weak connection,and the devices do not work properly."
1,Fell apart after 5 months,"I bought this in late January of this year and it fell apart last night. I plugged it in the day after I got it and I have not moved it until I went to dust (yes, I only dust 2 or 3 times a year) and the USB connection just fell out. I will be contacting the company."
5,"Solid device, good price","This is a very compact, well-built USB hub which worked right out of the box with both Windows XP and 2000.It was purchased for 1) it's price and 2) it's size. The hub is well-worth the money and more of these hubs are in order for the other computers around the house. Of course, the small size means that it is easily dragged around by the movement of any cord attached to it. Some Velcro or double-stick tape might be useful to hold the hub in place.One possible disadvantage to this hub is that there is no option to plug in an external power supply. This limits the total amount of power that can be used by the devices plugged into the hub. To help with this, the hub comes with a Y cable and can be plugged into two ports on the computer. On the ""computer-side"" of the cable, the black connector provides both power and data to the hub. Optionally, you can plug in the red connector to provide additional power to the hub."
1,They changed the design,"I purchased the 4-port desktop USB 2.0 hub.They changed logo, design, and most-importantly to me, they changed the LEDs from blue to red. I didn't even bother opening it. You can't trust the other reviews, since this is a revised/different product.Everything I have is silver (aluminum case) with blue LEDs (monitor, etc.). I bought this overpriced, simple device based on it being able to match. It doesn't.Most of the reviews here are from 5 to 10 years old. They are for a different product/revision."
1,Junk.,"Purchased July 23, it's now Aug 5th and the thing is dead. No Power. Dunno what the warranty is, am going to try and contact them, but honestly, that amount of time indicates the thing sucks."
3,After a Year of Use,"Actually, I've probably had it for a year and a half now.Pros:- For the most part this product has functioned quite well- Most of the ports still work (6 of 7)- Design is nice, I like having output and power on one side and ports on the other for space purposes.- Outlasted my other hub (can't remember the make or model - I threw it away some time ago)Cons:- One of the ports stopped working about three months ago.- Everytime I start my computer I have to unplug and replug at least one or more of the devices in the hub to get them to work. For instance, when I start the computer and the mouse and keyboard are already plugged into the hub, they will not work until unplugging them and plugging them back in. This is consistent - EVERY time I turn on or restart my computer this has to be done. Kind of a pain."
2,Not USB 2.0,"The ""See more technical details"" link indicatesStandards: USB (1.1, 2.0)However, the hub is USB 1.1, not 2.0. The cable, size, and function are nice, but the description should be clear that transfers will not be at USB 2.0 speeds. An e-mail response from Targus after receiving the product included:The Targus Ultra Mini 4-Port USB Hub Model # PA055Uis a USB 1.1 hub. It does not support USB 2.0.At this point in time, a USB 2.0 alternative was what I was looking for, and what I would recommend."
5,Small and convenient,"The 4 Port Slim USB 2.0 Hub is a very compact and portable USB 2 hub. I was able to easily plug in the device and attach my printer, headset, and mouse, which all worked fine without using the AC adaptor. The design works nicely, with 2 ports on either side which makes plugging everything in easier. Matching these characteristics to an affordable price, I am very satisfied with this product."
3,Gay push and misandry but little progress in the witch wars.,"Sweep 5, Awakening, is about heroine Morgan dealing with the aftermath of her former BF, Cal, and his mother trying to murder her in a burning building at the end of the previous volume. Cal and mother left town. Morgan and her coven mates put pieces back together with the help of Witch Council Seeker, Hunter. Morgan ends her jealousy feud with childhood friend, Bree. She ends up helping the Seeker to stop another local witch who is doing Dark Magic. Gay push and misandry become major themes in this volume as the lesbian characters are attacked by young men. Gay push and misandry are unfortunate in a book series written for teens.Perhaps its better for young readers, but it seems to me that this series is broken up into 2 or 3 times as many volumes as needed. This volume has little that furthers the overall plots of the series."
5,so addicted,because i was so getting into the story that is why i was forced to buy this ebook at the middle of the night. i really wanted to know so badly what was going on.. it is a good book for me because it makes me want to know more..
4,Cal and Selene are gone,"After the events of the previous book, Selene and Cal have fled. But if they have fled, who is working dark magic in town? And what is the evil presence Morgan ran into? These are questions Morgan wants the answers to and ones that Hunter is bound to discover.But, while the hunt for evil goes on and Morgan is not sure who to trust, Morgan's final refuge is in trouble. The witch store Practical Magic may be forced to close. Now what will Morgan do? There is even trouble for Aunt Eileen and her new house.A very interesting story as we see Morgan begin her recovery from previous events as well as learn more about Hunter and Sky (some very interesting revelations there)."
5,Keeps up the good run,"So, yesterday as the long awaited (a whole month) book comes out I stayed up till past the witching hour quickly gobbling this story up. I couldn't imagine reading this book by itself but it does keep a good pace as far as it is written in the series. About the story developement... I don't want to spoil anything... Das Boot has a nasty face lift Love is found again and it is beautiful. And someone who was an interesting side character is ""hunted""--- Light Love and Laughter..."
3,freshest kid,freshest kid is worth to look at because I did most of what they did when I was a kid growing up.BreaKDANCING was a world wide format which alot of people embraced if you was notice and was good everybody that like breaking would give you mad prop .the crab walk or spider walk was also a breakdancer move because it show how flexible you are when you bunny hop with it.I which it was in the movie because I had a partner from Newyork and we go different club in Miami and girls goes nut over it plus our styles compliment each other.It brought me memory definitely the movie is worth looking at because I have sons and tell them I use to do it but you really have to practice to be really good at it.
5,"what scratch is to DJ's ""freshest kids"" is to a B-BOY","The only words i can use to describe this movie are""FRESH, DOPE and FLY"" This movie is for the true hip hop head the ones that have WILD STYLE, KRUSH GROOVE, STYLE WARS and SCRATCH in their collections need to pick this one up.""SUPPORT UNDERGROUND HIP HOP, B-BOYS UNITE""TOTHOUGHT"
4,Hip Hop 101,"This is a great way to learn about the history of Hip Hop and The ""B-Boy"". I grew up listening to Hip Hop ( 1984 thru 1995 ). This DVD was accurate, educational and entertaining. True to what real Hip Hop and B-Boys are all about!!"
4,"GREAT, GREAT GREAT",This video is definitely a worth wild DVD. From the original footage to today - it was all great. I watched it three times over the weekend and still saw new moves that Ive never saw before. its a great investment. Crazy Legs is the man.
2,"Wow, marketing really got me good this time.","This vid was really hilarious. This old man (legend, have you) could barely move yet we are supposed to be learning top secret tips of ASHI-WAZA.But all we see is a bumbling old man do Kata form, and...AND, the variations they speak of, are different camera angles....WOW!I picked up 2 or 3 things from this video, so if you see 30 bucks as like paying for an open mat session and learning 1 or 2 things, be my guest, otherwise... Neh!"
4,neat horse story,Jane is the main character in the book. Her grandmother buys a pony that she had sold years ago and gives it to Jane for her birthday. The horse is named Popcorn and he's trouble. Jane has to send him to a camp to get trained so that she can ride him. Meanwhile Jane takes riding lessons to become a better rider. The horse learns to take commands and Jane learns to give them well. The are together again and even win a ribbon in a horse show.The book has large print text. This is good for young readers.I would recommend this book to girls who are interested in horses. Girls ages 7-10 will relate to the main character Jane well.
4,Pony,The Birthday PonyBy GillianThe Birthday Pony by Jessie Haas is about a horse being born the same day as a little girl! The birthday ponies theme is helping because the little girl Jane and Grandma Aggie helped Popcorn` s mother from the woods. I think the message is never give up you should never give up gust like when the girl gave up on taking care of popcorn. In this storey Popcorn changes a lot because everyone changes his life when Jane takes care of him. Letting Popcorn go is a symbol I think this because Jane has to let Popcorn and Sweatpea go. The problem is Jane is to far away to ride horses and the solution is her father got a new job a few blocks away. Now Jane can ride the horses. Before I read the Birthday Pony I thought no one could take care of a wild pony but now that I have read it my schema has change and I know that people can even take care of 2 ponies. I recommend this book for kids that ride horses or have a horse or love horse because it is all about loving horses.
2,Ad is not as accurately described,This is a miniature model and not functional. Ad should be specific that it is a model and not functional in anyway
4,"It helped, but didn't cure.","I purchased the Happy Jack at the recommendation of a friend. I did dip my dog in it and it has helped. But, he is still doing some scratching. Maybe after I do it again it will take care of his problem. I will say it has worked better then anything else I have used. You just have to be so careful using it. The vet. said he could put him on a steroid, but that can damage their liver so I don't want to do that."
4,Music,"Music should be there to dispell ignorance and say something about the world we live in. Pop stars are there to look pretty. Pop stars spread ignorance through meaningless emptiness. Public enemy are one of the few voices left in music, speaking politicaly cold as always. Long may they continue. Music with a message. This is the way it should be."
1,Buy Fear of a Black Planet or It takes a Nations of Millions,"Knuff respect to Public Enemy, they are one of the few groups in Hip-Hop history who've provided fans with ill beats and consciouss lyrics. With that said, this single blows. It's trash. The beats are trash, Chuck D and Flavor Flav don't rap, the DVD is just them hanging out in some clubs. It's a shame, legends such as Public Enemy are far above this remedial single. If you want to hear their best worx, go and buy Fear of a Black Planet, or It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back. You won't be dissapointed..."
5,Very clear and complete examples.,"Unlike other Swedish grammer books for English speakers, this book is both compact and easily ""carryable"" but also complete and full of fantastic examples. This book gives Swedish examples and translates all of them into English. The book tells you how English and Swedish are similar or different, which makes it easier to memorize the rules of Swedish. Furthermore, the book makes good use of bold print and different type sizes to draw your attention to the most important part of the rule being taught. Because of the great use of examples, this book is a very good choice for English speakers who can't define every part of speech; this book defines the parts and shows you how they work. (This book explains the difference between ""who"" and ""whom"" better than any English teacher I've ever had!)"
4,Quick Reference,"Hej People,Swedish is a very wonderful language, even easier than English. And the book ""Essentials of Swedish Grammar"" even makes the study of the Swedish language even easier and faster.If you believe in photographic memory, this book is will work for you. Not only that the book is easy to understand, it is also easy to memorize photographically.As a student studying European Languages in the University, I would say that ""Essentials of Swedish Grammar"" is one of the best Grammar books I am using.This book will surely help you in studying Swedish.Happy reading and good luck to you all."
5,Swedish Grammar - very helpful,"This book is worth buying. It explains a lot of the ways the sentences are constructed in Swedish. I needed a more precise explanation in English. This book breaks down the sentences, use of verbs, subject etc in a way that is very easy to understand. Its an easy read, has a helpful number chart in the back for numbers/ counting, not a lot of fluff or useless writing, and its to the point. I am happy I bought it. This book along with my Unabridged Swedish dictionary and 2,000 Common Swedish verbs has made my Swedish language class easier. If you are someone who likes to know ""WHY"" you are writing this or that...then buy this book."
4,swedish book,the book is very good .the meanings are easy for the foreigners and anyone can read it.in order to start learn Swedish you will nead this book one other for vocabulary and a cd for listenings.
4,Essentials of Swedish Grammar,"Looks like the dictionary I can use to improve my Swedish. The font is a little small for my 72 year old eyes, otherwise no complaint."
3,A good overview of an intimidating place,"This guidebook was controversial when it first came out because it drew attention to a place coveted as mysterious, dangerous and reserved for experienced hardmen. Luckily the bare bones topos and descriptions of the lesser known climbs kept many routes mysterious. A good guidebook for the well traveled routes but not so much for the lesser known ones. With that said it does include some cool historical notes and profiles of well known Black Canyon climbers which makes for good toilet reading. A fine effort overall by the author."
1,Absolute waste of money!,"This DVD runs only about 44 minutes, instead of the listed 60 minutes. Each routine segment is about 3 minutes long and a few aren't even that funny. Although Brad Garrett's impersonations (especially Bill Cosby's) are extremely funny, this DVD is a huge disappointment."
3,Was what I expected and in very good condition,Arrived on time and in good condition. I do not have a chance to do much Musky fishing but will certainly use them again.
1,Do not waste your time and money,"Although the author seems to have a hint of knowledge about civil law, his anger against his former faith and congregation are more evident than his intellect. The size of the font on each section heading is more striking than the content. I got this book from a friend who got it from another friend for free. I was surprised to see it here, of all places, good Amazon.com. It is a desperate attempt to resurrect a dead issue, and a mediocre writing career. Please don't waste your money!"
2,Boring!,"My daughter loves Elmo and puppies, but this book is a bore for her! Plus she tore the flap on the pages. Very poorly made."
5,Show Stopper,"This Umbra Trapeze Clock is a true find. Everyone loves it!! The respone is ""OMG Where did you get that clock ?, I've never seen anything like it."" I immediately changed the subject graciously. ( I have it hanging in the kitchen goes great with the Stainless Steel Appliances, Granite counters and Glass Cabinet Doors."
2,Glass Wall Clock,"I received this package quickly. The item was well packaged and could not have been damaged. It was easy to assemble and is still working well. As a reminder, the wall color is key to this clock. A dark wall will make the hands seem to disappear, a lighter color wall is better."
3,Good clock,"This is a very modern looking clock . However I was expecting a bigger one than actually what it is. It's much smaller than what the dimensions say. I was under the impression that the height of clock listed under the dimensions, is of the clock itself and does not include length of the strings. But I was wrong!Be careful before you buy, it is very hard to visualize buying online."
2,not correctly described,"the description is wrong. you get 1 large towel, 1 bath towel, 3 hand towels, and 4 wash cloths."
1,Wrong Picture,"Not only was the description wrong, the color was wrong also. I received 2 bath towles instead of 1 bath sheet and 1 bath towel, 2 hand towles and 4 washcloths, The picture shows a sky blue towel set with thin dark blue stripes, there are not any thin dark blue stripes on the towle set that I received. This is the only reason that I bought this towel set. The towel set that I received was all sky blue. I will never buy anything from Homespell again........."
3,"No whitewash, Gravelle tells it like it was.","This book gave me insight into the history behind the animosity between native and Indo-Fijians. Convinced that the natives were ""lazy"" because they insisted on resting during the hottest part of the day before returning to work in the evening, colonial British began to import labourers for the sugar cane fields from the subcontinent with promises of land to those who'd indenture themselves for an agreed upon span of years. The British failed to understand the deep connection to land that the indigenous Fijians felt and their revulsion at the idea of their lands falling into ownership of foreigners. And so the troubles began. This history served me as a helpful resource for understanding the cultural and racial divides that remain there to this day."
4,Good for the price,I ordered 5 of the Case DVD Storage trays and they do exactly what they are supposed to do (store DVD's). The construction is fine and appear durable enough especially for the price ! My one critisism is that they do not stack real well! Specifically they do not lock in place. Had I designed this unit I would have simply made the interlocking slide with more of a groove which locks in place! To compensate for this I just used some clear Packing tape to secure them together and it works just fine!
1,junk,ordered 2 sent 1 payed more for freight then what the product was worth. no advance notice on only shiping 1not good. also product was junk. very disapointed.
5,GREAT!!,"I love doing the 3-d sudoku puzzles but there is a limited supply and for some reason they are not being published. During the holiday one of the 3-d sudoku books went over $100.00, too too much. I completed that book and was willing to do it again but not pay that kind of money and besides it was not available. Such a shame. Why is the market so limited for such a great item?"
3,Shipping was not what I asked for...,The book is fine. I asked for the shipping to go to an inmate in a jail. Didn't happen. Sent to me instead...missing a big market because of mess ups like this! I won't be trying it again.
1,Product doesn't meet specifications,"The Buffalo website indicates that the Linkstation Pro allows you to access your files from the web. I emailed Buffalo tech support before buying, and they confirmed this. However, after about a month's correspondence with Buffalo they ultimately admitted that web access isn't supported on this model. I'm hence not at all impressed."
5,La imaginación y el esoterismo en su mejor conjunción!!!,"Borges ha planteado un mundo aparte del mundo real. Un mundo paralelo en donde se teje otro universo, ¿por qué no?, igual de verdadero, en la misma recta del tiempo, pero en otro espacio. A través de la óptica del gran mago, del demiurgo arquetípico, Borges intuye una zona en el espacio y en el tiempo, desde donde todo se puede ver, escuchar, saber. Una zona donde existe una correspondencia biunívoca entre el universo total y cada punto de esta región...aquél que descubra esta zona, podrá verlo todo, escucharlo todo, saberlo todo, poseerlo todo. La lectura del Aleph y las demás narraciones del libro del mismo nombre, lo pondrán, amigo lector, en la justa dimensión que coloca el gran maestro a sus alumnos cuando les dice sutilmente: ""El que tenga ojos, que vea; el que tenga oídos, que escuche..."""
1,Not a bad product,"I purchased the 120GB version a couple of months ago and have been happy with it. It seems to be everything it says it is. The only downside to it is their software. Even the tech support guy told me about how slow it was. After talking with him I then tried Microsoft Backup which comes with XP. It would take around 10-12 hours for the simpledrive software to back up my entire hard disk. It took Microsoft Backup under two hours to do this. I won't be using Simpletech's software anymore, although I am buying another drive."
2,"""Eeeeeeeeeeeee......""","At first, this drive seemed just what I was looking for. I plugged it in and It Just Worked. So I immediately set about copying a bunch of stuff from my unofficial backup system (a big pile of CD-R's) to my new drive.After about 20 minutes of this, a high-pitched ""Eeeeeeeeeee"" sound started coming from the drive. My wife noticed it too. So did our dog - the high pitch caused canine conniptions.I disconnected and powered off the drive. Blessed silence. I tried again after a couple of hours. Quiet at first, but soon enough ""Eeeeeeeeeeeeee"" once again.I spent a day or so wondering if I could put up with this over the long term, and decided against it. Back to Amazon it went, and my money was promptly refunded. I bought another drive from AcomData, 160gb, for the same price as this one, and now I'm a happy camper.Maybe I just got a bad apple; most of the other reviews on this seem positive."
5,"Great product, great price","I needed an external hard drive because I was close to exceeding the available space on my laptop (mainly because of music files). I chose this item because of the comparably low price and because of its sleek design. Everything worked as it should have, and it took just over an hour to move 40 GB of files from my laptop to the external drive via the included USB connection."
3,beware of product description,"Be aware the product description mentions a FIREWIRE connection, in addition to the USB connection. The model shipped by Amazon does NOT have the FIREWIRE connection. It only comes with the USB port. You need to go elsewhere if you want FIREWIRE as well. I had to return two to Amazon and get a refund (they shipped the same version twice).I ended up getting one from Dell.com and the product works fine. No complaints."
1,Broken in 1 month,I bought this External Hard Drive at the end of June and by the end of July the Drive just did not work! The active light still comes on bud the disk will not spin up. SimpleTech will replace the drive but will do nothing to help retrieve the two years of digital photos I have stored on the disk. Simpletech will not even recommend a company that can help. I've looked around and some data retrieval houses want 600.00 to get the data from the disk. Do not buy this product.
2,Best overall review of the history of commercial diving ever written!,"Torrance Parker is the most experience commercial diver living! His personal story is one of the most inspirational ever written! Born and raised in Bartelsville, OK, he ran away from home to be a deepsea diver in Tarpon Springs, Florida where he learned hardhat diving from the Greek Sponge divers. Coming to California after WW2 he established Parker Diving, which is now one of the largest commercial diving companies in the world. His story and the history of commercial diving is one of the most interesting ever writen. Diver, Pilot and philanthropist, Torrance Parker is one, if not the most interesting persons alive today!"
5,A book for anyone interested in heavy gear,"Torrance Parker has written a book that is a must for anyone interested in the history of diving heavy gear and the development of the L.A. Harbour. Full of stories and pictures of the commercial divers; their accomplishments, their lives, and in many cases, their deaths."
1,Skip it,"The other review doesn't make much sense. Niether does the book; maybe that was the point. If you are a computer user and wonder why lighting causes computer problems. Here it is. Of course you'd do better to search the net or read the back of the surge protector box. Designers beware, the book is just too simple."
3,I wanted comets!,"The cover says ""Comets"", but the text is not entirely devoted to the science of comets. It skims a lot of related subjects, but sometimes digresses a little too much. And this book is definitly popularized too far! Popularization is no excuse for (small) errors. IMHO, you'd better read ""Cosmic Pinball"" instead."
5,Fun & Informative,"This book reveals the history of comets and their place in the universe in layman's language. The author talks about comet Shoemaker-Levy 9's collision with Jupiter, what could happen if a large extra-terrestrial body hit the Earth. Levy also discusses possible preparations which could be taken to prevent or prepare for such a cataclysmic event. But it is not really a doom-and-gloom type book. It is a book filled with interesting ideas and facts. Lots of b&w illustrations throughout."
3,"Gilliam, head on...","Terry Gilliam, the dreamer. Now this director is the one to look up to. he fights, struggles, and maintains his vision.whether you get him or not, this guy is a character. and this dvd goes head on with that very man.this particular dvd, would normally be considered the extra discs for a feature film. but since the film fell through, for the time being, we are presented with the idea of Gilliam's vision and promise of Don Quixote. which is a true journey to take. it is a true 'documentry' and has a bit more just so it can stand on it's own. whether your an aspiring filmmaker or a curious other party, this piece is truly depressing, and displays inner compilations of the set up system that is big budget production."
4,"This is one of the saddest, most painful films I've ever seen","I thought I had it bad on the set of my little student film in college.Whew!Watching this documentary was very difficult and very interesting at the same time. I enjoyed it, despite the tragedy that played out on the screen.What makes the film so heartbreaking is that you know that the film will inevitably fail. So the entire movie-watching experience is steeped in dramatic irony. We, the viewers, know the outcome of this ill-fated film project known as ""The Man Who Killed Don Quixote."" But the filmmakers themselves, at the time of the filming, obviously do not know that all their actions are essentially in vain.A great film, and a powerful warning to those who thinking making movies is easy."
3,Lost in La Mancha,"First of all this is not a movie. It is about a Movie called, Lost In La Mancha that did not get finished. Basically This director went over budget and they had bad luck and they pulled the plug. Now his career is basically ruined. In anycase I found out about it in my Film Production class. this is basically a movie that anyone in film biz or wanting to work in film should watch. anyone else who thinks it's entertaining with Johnny Depp then you can forget about that right now.Great film for students of film/cinema very interesting way of talking about breakdowns, budgets, money, financing films, out of control directors. Why didnt' they just replace the director and go with CGI?In anycase Orson Welles never finished his film about Don Q either. It has bad luck. They first need to find a person to break the spell I guess."
3,Unfinished project...any investors out there?,"An interesting look at Terry Gilliam working, and his foregone reputation is certainly given some insight. Bad luck looms large, and the material shot isn't without interest, but it is hard to buy into the overstatement that ""Don Quixote"" is the Gilliam ""dream project"" - particularly based on some of his careless handling of it. It is certainly questionable how much Gilliam imagination and wit it would take to make this any kind of success at the suburban multiplex - even if it was in Imax 3D, Disney 3D or whatever 3D they have in your suburban hellhole. Does the cellphone generation care about Cervantes? Hopefully more investors will think so."
3,The Curse of Don Quixote,"Painful to watch, like anticipating an accident, this film kept me interested. I watched it with a producer who kept flinching, wincing and groaning as the story moved agonizingly forward. Why was so much attention placed on such a public display of failure?I believe reality TV is popular because people are fearful of failure. The truth is people come up short every day in millions of ways, and it's better to have failed at something than not to have tried anything.And this is not the first failed attempt to bring Don Quixote to the screen. Orson Wells couldn't do it and Terry Gilliam fell short. Bravo to anyone who has the courage to break the Curse of Don Quixote.Michael Durankowww.bootism.com"
2,Great DVD Extra,"Being a huge Johnny Depp fan, and quite fond of Terry Gilliam works (I even like The Adventures of Baron Van Moonchild) I was very much looking forward to getting this DVD, once I had finished watching it however I was terribly dissapointed. I am going into acting and though I would like to see a movie about the process, but not enough happened during the actual making of the film to credit a 'making of' or even an 'unmaking of' movie. If the production of 'The Man Who Killed Don Quixote' had lasted more than an week the documentary might have been able to stand on its own, but as it is I think it should have been saved to release with Terry Gililam's final version, even if they had to wait another couple of decades."
2,"Very pretty, somewhat boring","This recording of the new works by Theofanidis and Higdon is first rate. Great performances, and nice to hear along side the Copland, which stands out as the real masterpiece. Mind you, Theofanidis and Higdon are obviously really talented composers.I like new music. I like beautiful music. And I don't usually mind if the new music I hear is beautiful or ugly, has a tune, or not. What matters is that I am pulled in, and not lulled in with cliches or pandering.The Theofanidis seemed to be much more interesting to listen to than the Higdon. His sense of orchestral color is very strong. But overall, their music is very pretty, and somewhat boring. Get this to hear that great Copland: it is the piece that on this CD that pulls you in to listen. I know this piece is not the new piece on the CD, but it really stands the test of time against the more recent works."
3,Surprisingly Sloppy,"I won't comment too much on the new pieces here, but the performance of the Barber Symphony is surprisingly sloppy. The wind playing is really quite bad - check out the cracks in the bassoon and clarinet in their solos in the fugue or the intonation of the famous oboe solo. I'm frankly surprised that Spano put up with this type of execution. For a truly gorgeous rendition of the oboe solo, try Alsop's Naxos disc of this symphony. While the ""big"" moments sound good, with prominent brass, healthy and in tune strings, it's during the quieter moments that the ""cracks"" show, especially upon repeated listening. The Higdon piece has wonderful moments, and I like her music in general but must say this isn't the most impressive piece from her I've heard. The Theofanidis is simple and, if you like music that avoids counterpoint or harmonic motion, beautiful. I find that it doesn't reveal a whole lot of new facets on repeated listenings."
5,I can't define Drury's writing but I love him.,"I don't think it ruins anything to mention that the title comes from a painting of a girl's thoughts. How does Tom Drury think about so much and with such wit? As an experiment before writing this review I flipped the book open randomly at several points. Just as I thought, there was a wonderful surprise to be savored on every page. There are descriptions, scenes and sentences I wanted to bring home and turn into house pets. The fact that he manages to weave a plot around all this delicious satirical writing is amazing. I can't wait for his next book since I've read all three now."
4,His style is his salvation,"This book is somewhat shapeless, strewing red herrings as it wanders. The author definitely gives the impression of a writer who sits down at his desk each day with no firm direction. However, if you are a reader for whom the destination is less important than the journey, there is much here to interest you. The protagonist seems to be searching for something to cure his malaise, and this quest takes him from Belgium to small town New England to Scotland, well-wrought descriptively. Just don't expect a point to it all."
4,Very nice,"A fine stylist who has ALMOST found his voice...a good storyteller, but sometimes too much in love with his own well-chosen words. Sometimes reads like Don DeLillo lite. Still, you won't regret reading this fine book."
3,"a glorified promotional campaign for ""a course in miracles.""","I PURCHASED THE BOOK AND THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIRLY DESCENT READ.ALL IN ALL I THOUGHT RENARD,S BOOK WAS NOTHING MORE THAN AGLORIFIED PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN FOR ""A COURSE IN MIRACLES.""FURTHERMORE, IN MY OPINION I THINK MR.RENARD HAS A GREAT FUTUREIN WRITING SCIENCE FICTION."
1,Negative Stars,"Red Flag #1: This book lacks humility. Red Flag #2: It conveniently dismisses anyone who may constructively disagree with it. Red Flag #3: It has an air of it's own special brand of fundamentalism that made me very uncomfortable, unlike the actual COURSE which is beautiful, rich and loving. Red Flag #4: It's poorly written (all of the characters sound the same), it thinks it's funnier than it actually is (some of the ""humor"" is just plain creepy), and it's smug. Red Flag #5: I was expecting to learn amazing new things in this book, but it was really just a raunchy rehash of existing material."
1,Run Away,"Forgiving someone because they don't exist (""there's nobody out there"") is not compassionate. Dismissing the universe as a ""tiny, mad idea"" because you find some of it painful is not courageous. Reinterpreting the message of Jesus Christ is not the truth. Proposing a radical and severe thought system that diminishes the human condition is not the answer. And rejecting the ideas set forth in this particular book is certainly not crucifixion. Despite this book's appeal to human weakness, I love my imperfect life and the sometimes crazy world around me, with all its joys and its challenges."
5,Super,"The Disappearance of the Universe is a book that does many things very well. It entertains, (if you have a good sense of humor) explains and enables one to apply advanced spiritual teachings in such a way that anybody can ""get it"" (if they want to) and gives more information and saves the reader more time than probably any other spiritual book ever written. Really. Also, I just saw the author give a week long workshop at Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, New York, and he was absolutely fabulous. He's funny, humble and brilliant, in a street smart sort of way. He's the real deal, and so is this book."
1,"The Spirituality of ""Duh""","Enter the ascended masters in the author's living room, they got permission to call Jesus, just ""J"". The cosmic copyright is loosened for a new dispensation inspired by the regurgitated canned ""wisdom"" of the so called ""A Course in Miracles"". Odd that everything to be found in the alleged ""Course"" is all ripped off uncredited from Buddhist, Jain and Vedanta sources. It's books like this that can drive a sincere seeker to the arms of totalitarian traditionalism of Guenon & company. For more New Age pabulum for the masses- step this way folks!"
5,Opened the door for me,"You know.... I just happened upon this book one day, seeing it on my co-workers desk - I picked it up and got hooked on it.I had NO intention of reading ACIM, however, a few months after readingDOU and thinking over what it had to say, I finally bought and read the entire ACIM and am now on lesson 261 out of 365. If it wasn't for Gary's book, I would never have heard of ACIM, and I think if I had read it, I would have read a lot into it that was not there.So, this book really opened the door for me - in a big way!!"
1,Fatally Flawed,"This book is filled with contradictions. For instance, it states that ""the separation"" never occurred, then proceeds to instruct us on how to end it. It claims that no one is different or better than anyone else in any way, then casually mentions that Gary Renard is the direct reincarnation of an apostle. It says that there are countless other ways to God that are every bit as valuable, then arrogantly defines its own system as centuries ahead of the rest. It preaches love and forgiveness, yet passes more judgments than I can begin to count, and creates people who attack and belittle others. Not only is this book illogical, it's just plain unhealthy. It causes more separation than it claims to heal."
5,"An Excellent Read, and Very Enlightening","I completely enjoyed this book, and was astounded at the magnitude of the enlightening information it contains. The teachings are far above the level of the other popular spiritual books that are out there. Plus, unlike those other spiritual books, this one is a great read. It reads as good as any novel, yet it's non-fiction. A lot of the humor is laugh-out-loud funny. Don't miss out on the best spirituality book available, and thanks to the author for making this breakthrough information available."
2,Could not enjoy this book,I had heard a lot of great things about this book. I was very bored and unimpressed with it. I did not finish it.
1,Copied from Kenneth Wapnick,"Negative 20 stars for unoriginal stolen work. A fictional, poorly imagined story, using the ideas and writings of Kenneth Wapnick.Certainly not Renard's own. Save your money or support the real author of the information,ideas, and concepts Renard swiped to make money off of: Kenneth Wapnick.To associate this book with A Course in Miracles is terrible."
1,Give me a break,"I was taking this book seriously until I read this sentence in the first part of the book: ""If you want to be treated with kid gloves, go to an amusement park."" Are you kidding me? This was supposedly said by an ""Ascended Master"" or angel. The phrase ""kid gloves"" refers to a TYPE of glove, a glove made of young goat skin, i.e. a kid. It is very soft leather and was good for handling fragile items. I highly doubt that an ""Ascended Master"" would use the phrase ignorantly - they would know that the term has nothing to do with children! So, it blew the credibility for the book completely."
1,waste of time and money.,"Think of this book as ""Cliff's Notes of Course in Miracles"" with a heavy dose of self-righteous egotism, wrapped in poor writing. All the characters speak with the same voice, so you can't tell one from the next without checking back to the top of the paragraph to see who's speaking.More importantly, the author comes across as the Pat Robertson of the left. If he doesn't agree with someone politically, the other person can't be another decent human being with a reasoned and insightful approach -- no, he's an inhuman scumbag who ""doesn't care about people."" And as often as not, those prejudices are presented as blessed and confirmed by God.. or at least by Enlightened Beings.What good there is in this book comes straight from the Course in Miracles itself, so just skip the ego trip and go straight to the source."
3,A good introduction to ACIM,"What I like best about this book is that it served to introduce me to ""A Course in Miracles"". After reading Gary Renard's book I decided to read the source book directly for myself. What I found is a rare treasure among the world of spiritual teachings. So for that fact alone I am grateful for this book. Now in regards to ""The disappearence of the Universe"" it a fairly accurate rendering of the teachings from ACIM. However, it lacks the beauty and the depth offered by the source material. The part about the two acended masters visiting Mr. Renard and giving him this material in a series of dialogs is perhaps good for selling books, but doesn't benefit the content in any useful way. I would also recommend the Seth books as wonderful and powerful reading along this same line of thought."
5,On Course to the Course,"What a life changing book because it opens the door to A Course in Miracles. And once you have begun the Course, your life will never be the same. Gary does a great job of combining the truths of spiritual concepts with humor and not the holy sanctity that often accompanies it in religions. He definitely leaves you ready for the Course. Thank you, Gary- job well done!"
5,There's really something here,"This is probably the single most important work I've come upon. I'm not young (54), was classically educated and have five children. I've always been curious about the nature of consciousness, the purpose of existence, The Meaning of Life as they say. Having studied great philosophies and philosophers (including the Monty Python group), I am thrilled to experience this radical thought system. It's way not a downer."
5,Wonderful Book of Ideas,"When reading this book, I suspended judgment whether it was a ""true"" book, or pure fiction. I also did not care where the ideas came from. Perhaps they were channeled. Perhaps not. Perhaps all great work is channeled. In the end, the test is whether the ideas are valid and useful, or not. The ideas presented in this book were both valid and useful to me. I challenge anyone to read and truly attempt to understand this book and its content, and then to find contradictions in the basic content, to any great book of wisdom, or spirituality - including the Bible.More than that, it was entertaining, and quite easy to read. I highly recommend this book to those who seek more than this world can give them. When you find that empty place in your life, this book may very well help you to fill it...Good Luck, and God's speed."
2,Very similiar to Conversations with God,"It's amazing how the book resembles Donald's Walsh's Conversations with God and it's even more amazing that both were released about the same time. I gave it 2 stars because I agree with some of what is taught. But again all that's written in this book is just beliefs and stories, nothing more, nothing less."
2,My 2 Cents,"It concerns me when we feel most lost, most in need as human beings, we reach out for someone else's ideas and beliefs and let them supercede our own deep beliefs, history, and teachings. These books help some people; however the people who benefit the most are the authors and sellers.I recommend looking into one's own self, listening to elders and children, visiting our history/roots, family, culture, traditions, developing or using our talents, skills, abilities, having compassion, deepening our relationship with mother earth, and spirituality to find that deep connection and meaning in life. Yes, life does have great meaning. It is not an illusion. I am learning thru many ways. This book discusses the value of forgiveness. I am thankful for that reminder but discourage the idea of one truth or way of ""seeing"" or ""experiencing"" life as superceeding others.In any event, if my post has offended others, I hope they will forgive me."
1,A sucker is born every minute,"And then that sucker reads some other suckers books, and then writes his own lame excuse for a book, when if you take a step back and look at it all, it appears exactly like another pyramid scheme. The Secret, ACIM, these horrible motivational speakers we see on public broadcasting? The man was a GUITARIST! Billy Bob, I know your life might not seem as pretty or as enjoyable as the next guy, but do not waste your money on this book when you could be eating a very nice meal in a very classy restaurant for the same price.Think on that."
1,Why did i buy this book?,"I could kick myself for spending money on this book (at the advice of a friend and without reading the reviews). As soon I read that the author received the information for the book from spiritual beings that appeared in his living room, I knew I wouldn't be investing any more of my time in reading it."
1,MATRIX REGURGITATED,"This book is a complete rip-off of the Matrix films, reconstituted into new-age/self-help format. Instead of Neo, Morpheus and Trinity, we now have Jesus, Arten and Pursah ""projecting"" themselves into our illusory world. And the relentless Smith clones that used to take over people's bodies are now the many dark impulses of the ""ego"" that spring up inside us. In both the Disappearance and the Matrix, most people are totally unaware of the true nature of reality, with a few ""heroes"" who have awoken, who are now trying to free the human race. How perfect. Gary Renard has hitched a ride on a tried-and-true blockbuster formula. Lead us unto Zion."
1,Worst of the Worst,"I wish Amazon allowed 0 stars. Maybe I'm dense and unenlightened. Maybe I just don't understand. I suppose I am definitely being judgmental. Nonetheless, I'm going to post this review anyway. While I found ACIM itself to be helpful, I found DU to be an existentialistic and moronic perspective on it. Let's see, nothing matters because it doesn't exist anyway. Where have we heard this troubling kind of sophistry before. That's about all I can say."
2,not worth it,"i've noticed a lot of mudslinging (from both sides) concerning this book over the past few weeks, and thought i'd chime in. i think the occasional negative review is normal, healthy, and to be expected, and i think they bring up some valid concerns, many of which i agree with. in my humble opinion, it's the slew of 5 star reviews that seem repetitious and contrived. as far as the book goes, i really didn't think it was anything special. it reminded me of the celestine prophecy, just too far out there to be taken seriously. there are far more practical books out there that talk about the same sorts of things, without expecting you to jump off a mental cliff. but if you're into that kind of thing, i guess it would be a fairly entertaining read."
1,Delusions of Grandeur,"This book has taught me nothing about love or forgiveness. It has, however, taught me plenty about judgment and superiority. If you want to feel above-it-all or better-than-the-rest, by all means dive right into this book. It will surely convince you that you've stumbled upon the greatest spirituality ever conceived. Lucky you."
5,Thanks.,"Let me start out by saying that I would give anyone 5 stars for putting out a book that states they were visited by ascended masters. What can I say? This book deals with concepts of A Course in Miracles and I think it tries to get past some of the Christian terminology used there. I did have trouble with the ascended masters issue, many times, I felt like saying ""if I had them in my house I would be clarifying this issue or why are you talking about politics"". Once I got past that and just read it as people talking, I realized the book did what it was meant to do for me and that was getting me back on track with my studies of The Course. So for that alone I will say ""Thank you, Mr. Renard for putting out this book""."
5,portal to miracles!,"i am at the point in my life where the personal aspect of my created reality and all the interpretations that go along with that are in a new state of forgiveness, or release. this book, disappearance of the universe, is exactly about that level of mastery whereby all the personal inflections and tones of your ego supplied defense mechanisms simply disappear along with the rest of your self-created universe. it is also a gateway and primer for the course in miracles which can hardly be summed up in this small review. suffice it to say that this book speaks in a very specific way of subject material that defies language and the written word. yet it does it perfectly within the context of it's intention, which is healing and mastery. aloha from hawaii!"
5,Awesome,"This is a fun book with a good sense of humor that taught me more in the shortest period of time than any other spiritual book, and I've been reading them for 30 years. I like the way it teaches true forgiveness or true perception, which is in perfect harmony with the new physics rather than the old way of thinking. It undoes the ego and returns the practicioner home to God. ""God Is"" is the ultimate experience (not just an idea, but a true awareness) that this book leads to. Highly recommended."
5,Like A Hologram,This is a fantastic book where all the different parts fit together like a hologram and then all come together at the end. You can find the truth in each section and it all supports the book's major message of a new style of forgiveness. I love this book and I'm giving it to all my friends. I'm reading it again too.
1,I Totally Agree...,"...with just one concept out of this entire book. Our Thoughts Create Our Reality. So be very careful what you believe. If you follow this book and convince yourself that the universe is a horrible mistake, your body is a prison, and your human existence is meaningless, that is exactly what you will experience. This book says it's all done in the name of forgiveness, but there are saner ways of loving each other, folks.Life is literally what you make it, so I hope you make it a good one."
5,Uplifted and inspired,"The Disappearance of the Universe: Straight Talk About Illusions, Past Lives, Religion, Sex, Politics, and the Miracles of ForgivenessThis book has expedited my journey Home exponentially. I was inspired to read it and eternally am grateful for the inspiration Gary receives and shares with all of us. This book clarified A Course in Miracles for me such that I am now able to read it and 'get it' immediately. I recommend this book to anyone who is opening and seeking enlightenment."
5,Universal Truths That Apply To Everyone,"""The Disappearance Of The Universe"" is an excellent book and a leader in its category of spiritual books. It covers the big picture of the universe of time and space. It also covers everyday principles of spirituality that we can apply to enlighten our lives. It contains universal truths that apply to everyone. These universal truths will apply to you if you are not a religious person and they will also apply to you if you are a religious person, including any/all of the world's religions.This book is enjoyable and substantial, and it does have a sense of humor which is missing in many spiritual books. Many subjects are discussed in a complete and logical way. The book is long but not too long because it is very comprehensive on spiritual matters that effect the lives of every single person on the earth, religious and non-religious."
5,best book around!,"I have read this book 3 times and will likely do so again. I have been reading in this field of ontology (the study of being) for 33 years and have yet to find a better book. I was given A Course In Miracles 2 years ago but was not ready for it then. After reading this book, I was able to go back and read ACIM and be happy I did. This book is quite simply the best book for an overview for ACIM and will get you where you want to go even if you don't read ACIM. Yes it will take an open minded person to read this with understanding, but there those of us out there that ARE ready for this info. now. Take heart and if you are interested in the truth at all read this book!!!"
1,This Is Your Conscience Speaking,"If you like taking advice from hallucinations who get their ideas from a book of voices, then Disappearance of the Universe might be just what you're looking for. Frankly, I'm astounded that Mr. Renard was able to get away with selling this atrocity as nonfiction. In all fairness though, that was quite an impressive accomplishment for a book that reads more like the screenplay to a made-for-tv sci-fi/occult mystery. After being duped like this, I doubt I'll be purchasing any more books from this genre."
1,A Commercial for the A Course in Miracles,"Less than one star! DON'T WASTE YOUR CASH!!! My 'inner voices' tell me ""This is just a blatant commecial for the 'A course in Miracles' series of books , tapes , etc."" Some rich investor type guy listens to his own 'inner voices' and creates a commercial for a series of books and tapes !? What? That's enlightenment!!?? Well at least you might be able to forgive him , after you read his book anyway ."
1,Just Awful,"The Disappearance of the Universe is so negative, so condescending, and so dictatorial, but at the same time blames traditional Christianity for being the same way! There is a thin sugar-coating of love over an awful, fatalistic, morbid view of life. Basically we're told that everything we think, and everything we experience in our world is not only meaningless, but it's all a grotesque symbol of guilt and separation. When we look at anything with our physical eyes, even the people around us, we're seeing our fear and hatred of God. And then we have Gary Renard saying ""Hey, it wasn't me! I'm just an innocent bystander. These spirits descended into my living room and gave me all this information."" So not only does he give his book more mystique by coming from ""ascended masters,"" but he doesn't have to take responsibility for any of the content, either. What a joke!"
4,"Interesting, readable and clear","Another way to approach the philosophy and content of A Course in Miracles. It was easy and enjoyable to read, but also clarified many of the important points of the Course."
5,this book is a miralce...,There are so many books out there that are trying to say this - but this one covers it all - should be required reading - you basically can throw out all of your spiritual books and stick with this one (but if you haven't read Live Like A Fruit Fly - check it out on amazon)
4,ACIM Brought to Life,"Gary Renard, himself a student of A Course in Miracles, has briliantly managed to bring the teachings of the Course to a level much more understandable to the average reader.By inventing two ""Ascended Masters"" who serve in the role of teachers, Renard has made the Course an easy and oftentimes humorous read. Their banter is good natured and even risque when appropriate.Following in the footsteps of Walsch's Conversations with God, the fictitious characters in Renard's book not only give us refreshing insights into the sometimes obscure writings of ACIM, but convey to us Renard's own political views in a variety of clever and funny examples.Arten and Pursah may be imaginary characters, but they do a masterful job in igniting interest in A Course in Miracles."
1,Disappearance of credibility,"Gary Renard seems to rely heavily ""A Course In Miracle's "" popularity. The assertion that two ascended masters appeared to Renard along with the dialogue that he reports read like something out of a comic book. The author 's preoccupation with 'farts' and other bodily functions are juvenile in every respect. I hope that the Ascended Masters who reveal themselves are more mature and engender respect and deference unlike those in Renard's fiction. If not, heaven help us all."
4,"Lovely, funny and a darn good story!","I read this book with an open mind. I just love books that make me laugh. Is a good feeling to laugh and enjoy something that you are reading. Love the mix of Quantum Physics, Buddhism, Hinduism and some Daoism even though it's not supposed to be a dual teaching. Throw in some Christian symbols and you got a nice gumbo. I heard some people call it new age, well yes, we are in a new age. The 21st century. ; ) I truly enjoyed his style of telling a story. Funny fella. I can't wait for his 3rd book. Got to find out how he met the reincarnation of Arten. Love the darn soaps in written form. As for Acim nice teachings, a mix of all I mentioned above with a new twist. Well nothing is new, things tend to get recycled and in this days we need to recycle as much as we can. : )"
5,Super,"I love this book for many reasons. First of all, it has a good sense of humor, second, it has more useful spiritual information in it than any other book I've ever seen, thirdly, it explains why the world and the people in it are the way that they are, and fourth, how to solve the problem of human existence. All this is put in the framework of discussions the author has with two ""ascended masters"" who he says appeared to him in the flesh from out of nowhere. Whether you're ready to believe that or not doesn't matter. The content of this book is awesome."
5,A Good Way of Looking at Things,"I've listened to the CDs over and over for the past few weeks. I pick up new insights during each listen. They provide fairly simple explanations about; non-dualistism (God is not separate from me rather I am a part of Him), forgiveness being the key to reawakening to the Truth and is my real reason for being here, life is nothing but a dream/ a series of illusions and the universe and its people are nothing more than my projected images. It's all based on the tenets set for in A Course In Miracles.It's an interesting set of principles that I am trying to understand and practice.The narrators/ characters are pretty good, although the woman is tough to listen to at times. Anyway, I recommend this for new students of A Course In Miracles."
4,"Deeply thought provoking, hopeful, disquieting","I have found that during the time I was reading this book, and since I have finished it, I thought much of what was written was rather disturbing and unsettling. Disturbing in that it contradicts much of what I was taught as a child and have believed as an adult. It has quite a ring of truth to it. It has kept me wondering and thinking. It is a hopeful book, but also has left me feeling a bit sad. I think I'd need more than 1000 words to attempt to cover it all. I would recommend this book highly."
5,Disappearance of the Universe,"I haven't completed the book but it's a keeper, for sure. If you have any metaphysical beliefs, you will surely love this. Course in Miracles is a predominant theme, which I love.Anyway, don't let the title fool you...it's not about science, per se."
5,Review: Disappearance of the Universe,"I am in the process of reading Disappearance of the Universe for the third time. It helps me understand A Course in Miracles a lot better. I love Arten and Pursah!!! And Gary Renard, too, of course.Sincerely,Marilyn G. McCoy"
1,Vicious,"I just finished reading The Disappearance of the Universe, and I have to say I'm very offended by the hostile attitude taken towards people who dare to disagree with the ideas in this book. They're labeled ignorant, humorless, and close-minded. And to think these judgments come from people who extol the Holy Spirit. The hypocrisy is disgusting.Wayne Dyer seems to put his rubber stamp on every self-help book out there, so his endorsement doesn't mean much to me. Authors are always patting each other on the back, especially when they work for the same publisher. Regardless, any book that causes this much hostility among people should be avoided at all costs."
1,Useless mindset,"Why would you wish to believe that you live in hell? That babies are born impure? That the rain forest tree roots are fighting amongst themselves? This is just a mish-mosh of beliefs picked from here and there (mostly Christian) and filtered through a belief system of Gnostic Christianity that believes that the universe is sick and to promote ACIM. Ya ya ya, the world is hell, forgive everyone/everything 24/7 and go straight to heaven, etc. And if you have an interest in Taoism, Buddhism, please go to the source teachings and not this book. You might actually learn something about what they teach, and not what this book wants you to believe. I'm surprised they didn't refer to the Buddha as the Big B and Lao Tzu as Tao-Man. Just consider that maybe you are here to experience the joy of co-creation as God and you have nothing and no one to forgive? That you'll ""get home"" when you get there, so don't get so stressed? That's it's all really pretty easy? Wow, what a concept!"
5,A Great Read and Great Spiritual Teachings,"Before I read this book I had talked to several people who actually said that it's been the most important book to them that they've ever read in their life. So I had to read it. At first I was a little taken aback by the smart-ass style. But that turned out to be for a reason. As I went on I was enthralled by the story and how good a read this book is, and then by the magnitude of its spiritual teachings, which literally blow the other books out of the water. The Disappearance of the Universe is a great read that's full of great spiritual teachings. I agree that it's one of the most important, and probably the most important book I've ever read in regards to helping me understand everything about the universe and life."
3,"Great book, but too many opinions","I found this book to be extremely helpful in understanding the course. I can't give the book 5 stars due to the opinions regarding US foreign affairs by the author himself as well as the Enlightened Masters in the last quarter of the book. Everyone is of course entitled to opinions, but I just found it interesting that the Enlightened Masters had the same opinions he did. The author should have adhered more closely to the tenents of his book and refrained from making judgments."
5,A Message of Love and Forgiveness,"The Disappearance of the Universe is a book that makes many spirital points and makes them very clearly, among them that God really is perfect Love, and not the conflicted version of God that has been presented to us by organized religion, second that real forgiveness applies equally to everyone and is not just given to some and witheld from others, and finally that what we really are is love, but that the way for us to experience this love is to give love and forgiveness to others. Although this book covers a lot of ground, the consistency of the way it teaches unconditional love and forgiveness throughout is impressive. The style is irreverent, but it worked for me."
5,Challenging and brilliant,"The scholarly approach, thoughtful consideration of many theologies and philosophies makes this book an excellent read. Many of the ideas are challenging but intriguing to consider. The premise is brilliant. I use the information in this book every, single day. Brilliant!"
5,The Disappearance of the Universe,"Eye opening and thought provoking. Must be approached with a FULLY open mind. Makes sense! If you're ""hooked"" into the various translations of ""the"" bible as ""GOD's word""...don't buy this book. It will turn your concrete religious foundation into slush. Suggested reading accompaniment...""Conversations With God,"" Neale Donald Walsch. Both books are more about spirituality and less about religion."
5,"Riveting, and Funny","I've been waiting for a book like this for a long time. It not only explains everything but does it in a humorous and down to earth manner. The narration is riveting, as you feel you are sharing the experience with the author. I was blown away by this book."
1,Offensive and belittling,"The most offensive part of this book is the condescending attitude of the ""ascended masters"" towards those who disagree with their philosophy. Apparently those of us who challenge Renard's ideas are either viscous slaves-to-the-ego who have nothing better to do than attack, or we're just ""not ready"" for this ""amazing"" book. It never occurs to the author's pompous characters that they don't hold the monopoly on truth. This is a book, for goodness sake, written by a person, and it describes but one possibility. There are other legitimate viewpoints, and everyone is entitled to speak up about them. Attempting to dismiss or belittle those who make other choices is quite judgmental and hypocritical. A Course in Miracles (the inspiration for this book) says, ""the truth requires no defense."" It seems that The Disappearance of the Universe has forgotten that one."
5,Blows Most Books Away,"This is a take no prisoners book that blows most other spiritual books away. It is so strong and it's logic is so flawless that any honest and complete reading of this book would have to have a heavy influence on the reader's thinking for life. It's a comparison of the Holy Spirit's thought system of love compared to the ego's thought system of fear. Most books don't want to look at the ego's thought system and instead live in denial of it. This book takes the ego's thought system on head on and exposes it for what it is, dramatically illustrating exactly what we're up against and precisely how to choose the Holy Spirit's thought system, which we must if we want to achieve true enlightenment. BTW, this book is also fun to read. In fact, most spiritual books are boring compared to this. Highly recommended."
5,Disappearance of the Universe - excellent,"This book is an excellent introduction to A.C.I.M. Gary presents the information in a clear, open and understandable format which has a profound impact in its power.Those who are drawn to this book will reap the benefits if they are ready."
5,Serious Seekers Only,"I have read this book three times, and keep it handy to read excerpts.For those people who really understand that the concepts of The Course InMiracles are very important, but can't seem to commit to the time todo the serious study necessary, this book makes it all clear. I am sograteful for this book. It has changed my life. With sincere appreciation of Gary Renard, thank you. A. Marie Eichelberger"
4,Fun,"My book group was struggling with A Course in Miracles until I suggested we read Disappearance of a Universe. It helped everyone so much. It is written in a very down to earth mannerthat everyone could relate to, although his language at times is a bit rough! But adding that lightness to what he is conveying helps. Again a book everyone should read. It starts to change your perspective of the world and how skewed our perception is. Our world is based on duality and this book helps to illustrate this. We need to be working towards non-duality in order to heal ourselves.Dr. Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
5,Helped Me Understand TCIM,"Before reading Gary's book, I had been studying The Course In Miracles for about a year or so, and I still had many questions concerning the power of forgiveness. While this book does not take the place of TCIM, it does help unravel some of its teachings.I love the dialogue style of the book; it reads like a novel. It was very interesting that perhaps our future selves could come back and help us in this lifetime. I highly recommend the book to TCIM students, and anyone that might be interested in a different point of view other than the traditional religions so popular today."
2,Advertisment,"This is a 400+ page advertisement for a book called ""A Course In Miricles"". The first few chapters are repeated and recycled throughout the rest of the book."
3,Disappearance of the Universe,"The book was a little dry reading, it was written for liberals, some things in the book were a bit far fetched."
1,Rubbish,"Neo-Buddhist, Krishnas and all these other sort of ""eastern"" religion types don't really harken to the writings of the ""ascended"" masters, so to speak.This individual does what the neo-Pagan community has been wanting to do for years, throw everything out the window. He doesn't even try to talk about the classic masters, he just makes his own up.Isn't it lovely that these spiritual masters just appear to one nut-job and then bang, poof gone? Yeah... right.. more neo-Pagans trying to highjack reality."
1,nonsense,"Meandering nonsense. Spend what time you have here on Earth pursuing real truth in Christianity, not someone's private little philosophy of existence. I save all my books. This one i threw out."
5,steiner 20x80 senator binoculars,I went to the beach and was seeing things beyond the horizon from shore. Incredible!
4,a great read....,"i loved this book but it went to fast.i think if this book was longer and things went slower and there was a sequal,it would be great summer read. its hard to find a good book and this book is really good."
3,Like it a lot BUT not Love it.,"This book is about a guy-Spencer- who almost drowns, But is saved buy a girl who giver her a kiss in the water,Only he blank's out. He think's it's dream but,when he wake's up he has her necklace. She goes to someonr to make her have legs, but only for a few hour's. When she goes to lans she meet's another boy-Calvan-who help's her find him. I would like to say more but it you'ld give away most of the story. It was pretty good BUT I read Vampire Kisses- Let's just say to vampire kisses it was not very good."
5,Funny and exciting,"This is the worlds BEST book! As a Mermaid freak,I couldn't put this book down. Mixed with humor and romance, this is defently a book for those who enjoy fantasy. There REALLY needs to be a second one!- Collie"
5,Awesome amazing,It was amazing the best book ever so loving so so beautiful terrific amazing to good great job the best
4,it was good:),"i liked it.. but did anyone else think it sounded just like the movie ""Splash"" with Tom Hanks and Darryl Hannah?"
5,One of my top 3 favorite movies,"This cartoon has everything that spells out fun! Campy humor, dark humor, raunchy humor, gore, nudity, sex, ridiculous music to go with scenes, characters you love to watch over and over again, etc. I can't easily count how many times I watched this show since my first viewing.Absolutely ingenious!!!"
1,Terrible!,"No stars if I could!It sucked so bad I don't even know where to begin....so I'm not even wasting my time trying to dissect or criticize this ""movie""."
5,"A delirious, fun movie.","Rob Zombie's ""The Haunted World of El Superbeasto"" is a fast paced, delirious, fun time. It moves fast, entertains the hell out of the viewer, and is full of cartoon boobies! Viewers familiar with Zombie's first 2 movies, ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" will recognize the voices of Bill Mosely & Sid Haig as well as his wife Sheri Moon Zombie."" It's a recommended movie for those of us who wish Rob didn't do the 2 ""Halloween"" remakes and hope to see him do more original stuff. And this is a step in that better direction."
3,The same old story,"I really want to like Rob Zombie's body of film work. I really do. I made excuses for his early stuff since he was just starting out. I made excuses for Halloween since it really wasn't his story. But now he's come out with something uniquely his and it's just a tad disappointing. Maybe I'm just expecting too much, but Superbeasto just leaves me flat. It plays out like a Ren and Stimpy episode in overdrive. At first blush that might not sound like a bad thing, except that R&S; was awesome when it first came out almost 20 years ago - and to still ape that style and vibe is just a little tired. Sadly, I'm starting to think RZ just doesn't have the film-making chops to make the movies he sees in his head - kinda like giving a five year old sheet music for Mozart and expecting a symphony.Potty humor abounds and there are even some clever moments, but all in all The Haunted World of El Superbeasto is simply unremarkable.Two and a half stars if they had it."
3,Okay,It's funny and clever enough though the humor and language is vulgar. It reminds me of old loony tunes with the violence and gags. I don't mind having it in my collection and the price was reasonable but it isn't a must have.
3,Eh.,"Packed with a lot of inside genre nods and homage praising Russ Meyer to John Carpenter to Stanley Kubrick and, etc. - El Superbeasto is a bit overwhelming with a kitchen sink on top of that mountain. It seems to try to be like so many things and it's just a lot to process - it's like a Tarintino flick, but animated with stolen scenes from a million little unknown cult faves from yore. I liked it, glad I saw it. But it's not something I need to see again or even have in my collection. I appreciate what Zombie tries to do and wants to do, but he just never seems to pull it off and I am not really sure why. My major problem with the movie is Rosario Dawson's character's dialogue - the excessive Urban style yammering is not cute, funny, it's just plain annoying. This movie has everything I like in movies, packed full of all the genre greats - boobs, nazi's, werewolves, aliens, monster, devils, the list goes on, but it's just lifeless."
5,Hilarious Zombie?,"Rob Zombie goes out of his element on this animation, but no without putting in a load of horror icons. It is a seriously raunchy comedy, but as long as you have a very high and tolerable sense of humor you will definitely enjoy this movie."
4,MAINTENANCE EXCELLENCE,GOOD BUT RATER REPETITIVE IN HIS ELABORATION. A CONDENSED VERSION WITH THE MAIN FEATURES SHOULD BE A GOOD SELLER. HIS CHAPTER FOUR NEEDS SOME TOUCH UP TO BE MORE TO THE POINT. THE EXAMPLES ARE TOO LONG.
4,"Glorious Buffoonery, Trancendant idiocy, bitchin' Blues","this record is over the top fun - deliciously adolescent with some solid musical foundations, Sounds like King Con just crawled out of bed after a bender and translated his hangover into music - Solid Blues playing only deepens the vibe - Check it out!"
4,Very handy bit,"The bit produces super clean cuts that do actually fit together very well. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I find it a little challenging to get perfect allignment so the parts fit together perfectly...a lot of trial and error before getting it right. Also, the directions say that for a 3"" cut you just make two cuts on the piece you're cutting, but I found that produced very inaccurate cuts. I assume the mistakes are due to my own inexperience with setting up the bit, but seems to me it shouldn't be as complicated as it is."
5,OUTSTANDING,"What happened here? People weren't expecting much from this film but it somehow managed to be the movie that changed Sanjay Dutt's life yet again. This film is funny, uplifting and brings tears to the eyes too. Tell me one film that does all that? It touches your heart, breaks it, wins it and owns it. It was heartening to see Sunil Dutt act with his son. Boman Irani is superb as a bald professor. Gracy Singh is loveable. Easily one of the top 20 films I've seen in Bollywood.My Rating - 9.4/10"
1,disappointing pirated copy,i paid for a new DVD official licensed Munna Bhai MBBS. they sent me a pirated copy. poor images very scratchy. want refund. look out for this vendor.
4,Reconciliation Counts,I had some complaints. Mind you they were minor. But they were addressed QUICKLY and without hesitation. I am impressed with the expedient customer service.
4,Great Intro on Western Philosophy,"This book is a great introduction to philosophy. I will even go as far as to say it's the best introductory book I have ever read. The book expounds on concepts that are made more difficult than they should be with other so-called introductory books on philosophy, and makes them easy to understand.For the first time in my life, I can honestly say I understand the concept of metaphysics and have a good grounding on it. As other reviewers have pointed out, the book is a little bit outdated because it was written a couple of decades ago, but its ease of understanding and very clear prose are what make it worthwhile.I would highly recommend this book for those who consider themselves laymen as well as for students and those more advanced in philosophy (who are few and far between)."
4,Tough Read,"Philosophy lovers out there, this book by lavine takes you viewpoints of people from Descartes, to the ideology of marxism."
1,Misleading and false advertising,"If it fits great, it will do the job. But the advertising on Amazon cleary says "".... Rubberized lens hood stretches to fit lenses from 48mm up to 77mm filter size...."" Hogwash! It fits 52 to maybe 58mm. I could not get this thing on a canon 77mm filter size lens with a pry bar. It falls off a 48mm filter and if you push it back onto the len itself it covers the guage reading distance. Save your $$$"
1,Would pass on this for sure,I purchased this to put on my 70-300 lens for my Cannon Rebel XTI and absolutly could not get it on the lens. It was a real waste of money as I ended up throwing it away.
2,Not Recommended,"I like the Body Armor but this Lens Armor is neither needed nor useful. For one, it is a very soft rubber. It simply slips over the tip of the lens and doesn't stay in place well when on a 52mm.When putting the camera in and out of the camera case the robber hood is in the way, falls off and gets pressed out of shape.All in all a good thought but not well executed."
2,"Eh, it works.","I didn't have much trouble getting it on my 77mm, it was tight, but it got on there. Decided not to use it however, because it attracts dust, hair, and dirt. Not something I want around my glass. Good idea, I suppose it would be nice to have on if I know I'm going to be bumped into a lot or something. I keep it with me in my case, JUST IN CASE. Not recommended."
1,Kind of works - Buyer Beware,"While the hood is a great unit for 58mm filter sizes, there is no way this unit works on anything much larger or smaller for that matter. The product desciption ""up to 85mm..."" is deceptive and misleading. I could not get this hood on a 77mm canon filter size lens with a crow bar. Use caution."
1,Useless,I don't recommend this product. Much better lens hoods are available to protect your investment than this. I purchased the camera armor and figured I would get this also. The Camera Armor is worth the money it never leaves my Canon 50D that I take everywhere with me and works great. The lens hood Does not fit on my senses well and prevents some of them from working correctly.
4,Good for the price,"All I can say is that I am very satisfied with this product. I have not had any problems (knock on wood) and, for the money, it is well worth it...especially with the car kit included. The real test is to see how it holds up over time. If you do not want to spend the extra money on a Sony or Panasonic, give this one a shot!"
1,"Wrong item, not as pictured","This was the first time I've tried to buy something like this on-line. I'm hesitant to do it again. The item that is pictured was not the one I received. While the company appears to have lots of satisfied customers, I am not one of them. Maybe it was a simple mistake on the part of whomever shipped the item but the grate cover I received did not have the simple one oval hole per row as in the picture, rather it has two and three ""segmented"" holes in alternating rows in an oval shape. It was a medium strength plastic that was not like the metal ""looking"" hard foam grate I was looking to replace. Very disappointing!!"
5,Very informative,"This DVD is well done and worth every penny. If you would like to know the truth about the religion from someone who did not leave due to being jilted, this is the way to go. He gives an in dept teaching as to what is taught behind closed doors, and what most of their own ""members"" don't even know about. Every born again, saved by grace, and not by works lest any man should boast Christian, needs to get this DVD (or borrow it). The Holy Bible states in Hosea 4:6a My people are destroyed for lack of knowledgeHosea 4:6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.Mormonism's Temple of Doom DVD"
2,Short on Seinfeld -- And Laughs,"What's the deal with false advertising... If you are hoping to see some great standup by Jerry Seinfeld, forget it. You get an approximately 90-second clip. But that doesn't stop them from featuring him prominently on the cover of this DVD. The rest of the bits are so-so. Ray Romano is the best of the bunch. My advice is to rent this one, not purchse it."
1,Skip it,"The only reason I bought this was because Paula Poundstone was on it and as of yet, there is no full-length DVD of her stand-up act. Her clip didn't even last four minutes! Right when I got into it, it ended! None of the other comics (except Tim Allen) were that good. Not worth it."
1,MISREPRESENTATION,THIS DVD HAD A VERY SHORT SEINFELD JOKE AND THE REST WERE VERYMEDIOCRE COMEDIANS. I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PURCHASE.
2,"wrong size, but seems like a good product",should have sent it back but did not realize it was wrong size till I needed it. My fault. will pass it on to some kid with a flat tire someday.
4,Minimalist style,"If you already know and like the minimalist style from Philip Glass, you'll have more chances on liking the musics on this album.It's really a mood thing. Sometimes you will play and love it, sometimes you'll just get bored over it. That's also valid for listeners.Some people will love it, some people will get sleepy.Still, a great aquisition for intermediate piano students."
4,"Easy and repetitive, but somehow succeeeds with that","If you can play arpeggios worth a cent, you can play this flawlessly in one to two practice sessions per piece. The pieces consist of only a few lines of music each, which are repeated ad nauseum throughout the songs. It's an interesting style that provides good background music, but kind of grates on the ears after a while."
3,Good to limber up the fingers,"I agree with everything previous reviewers have written about these pieces. They are repetative, and ad nauseum, is a good term. They are easy to tackle in one to two sittings, but the real value is how well they limber up my fingers for some more serious playing. More fun than the usual scales and chord inversions. After a few minutes of working these pieces Mozart and Beethoven pieces run more smoothly."
2,good bike for someone who never intends to ride one,"This bike is very poor quality and I would not recommend. As an example, the front wheel spokes were so out of whack on receipt that the wheel looked warped. Whoever boxed it up at the factory should have noticed it was that way. It was not worth the hassle to return for another as a relacement might have been worse, and cost us more to get it ""tweaked"" by a professional after assembly than the bike cost. I'll never buy another Mongoose! What a waste of money!"
2,Need to be an engineer to assemble!,"I purchased this bike a short time ago. I have been trying to assemble it for 3 days now. The pictures do not look anything like the bike. After I finally assembled it (on pure instinct), the front brake was difficult to adjust - but I managed. The back brake is broken and needs to be replaced - I think. The shifting unit was not factory assembled properly. I had to take the shifting unit apart, as well as take the back tire off of the bike, and re-assemble it for it to even function. Now that it is functioning, I am trying to adjust it to shift properly. I guess that was too much to ask, because it is still not working properly. However, the bike looks awesome. I can't wait to finally be able to ride it....although it will probably be snowing by then....."
4,Overall very pleased,"The bike came well packaged and was easy enough to put together. I would recommend getting the bike fully tuned after putting it together or have a professional put it together unless you trust whoever partially assembled it before shipping. The chain sticks sometimes when you are trying to shift gears, but this hasn't given me too many problems and it's not like the chain falls off, just if you are switching from 5 to 4 it doesn't switch right away sometimes. Overall, very pleased for the price. Oh and get a comfortable seat."
2,Happy but not happy,Well i loved the bike at first. I was able to put it togehter easy enough and loved it for the first month. I rode it about ten miles a day for the past 4 to 5 months. The brakes are very difficult to keep adjusted and and also the gear shifter. The rear tire keeps coming loose from baering house and the bike is very heavy. I thought by buying a bike for a little bit more money than a k-mart or walmart would of done me good but in all i should of spent the money on a hi end bike for what i needed. So if you need a weekend warrior this is the bike for you. Amazon has always been the best internet shopping site. Please don't refer the rating of mongoose products to any afliates of amazon.
1,This bike is horrible!!,I bought this bike from Amazon because it was on sale for $140 and had average reviews. I spent another $30 to assemble it. The bike is really heavy and hard to ride. The tires are too wide and the bike broke after riding it couple of times. I have had this bike for almost year now and occasionally ride it. Do not believe the other reviews. This is crap.
2,Not the best,This bike is kind of hard to put together. Instructions are not the best. The ride quality is average. It is good for just getting around town. I would not go mountain biking with this bike. Good bike to buy on sale.
3,Cheesy Tire,"The bike looks fine, rides ok. But the tire is like cheese. It leaks after only 2 short rides on a concrete road in a park. I later found a thorn piercing both outer and inner tube. Being a mountain bike, you'd expect it to be able to handle a little rougher terrain."
3,Cheap & functional sums it up,Arrived quickly and was simple to assemble.I have found it impossible to make this a 21 speed because the gear shifter won't allow the degree of control to get into all states. I would have preferred fewer gears with no change issues. The shocks squeak like the dickens but....I expected all of this and am content with my purchase.
3,My assembly was not as easy as it should have been,"When I received the bike, the wedge that is used to secure the handle bars to the frame was completely stripped. I ended up going to a bike shop and purchasing a new screw/wedge. When I put that in, the wedge was still slipping and the handle bars could turn independently from the wheel itself. I ended up tightening that to the point where I stripped the new screw (go figure), so I had to drill that out. Luckily I still had the old screw, so I tried again. The handle bars now stay secure to the point where I can do lax street riding, but NEVER go mountain biking (with out risking death or loss of limb). Maybe I'll take it to a bike shop again and let them handle it completely. Total additional cost to me so far, about $9, so $70 total (plus about 3 hours of personal labor) for a bike, still not really a bad deal.Footnotes: Faulty piece of hardware caused me to create a lot of hassle for myself....still worth it for the cost."
3,Ok for the price,"as most here have said, it is a cheaper bike and that is what you should expect.Mine came beat up too, box was full of holes and the bike was full of scratches but overall nothing more than cosmetic. It only took about 1/2 hour to assemble, but it took another 2 hours to get the shifting to work, and to align and true the wheels. I am not a bike guy but it was pretty easy to adjust the shifting and tweak the spokes to get the wheels straighter. If I had paid full price, I wouldn't have been happy, but for the $60 Black Friday deal, I can live with it."
1,An attractive bike made of very cheap parts,"Bought this bike during the big sale. I have several bikes and am a pretty good bike tuner. [...] Fortunately the bike was fine. Assembly went smothly. Unfortunately this bike has very poor quality parts, brakes, wheels, shifters, etc. If you need to get a cool bike for around [...] get one of these but make sure it comes from a store that can work with you on set up. Forget being able to adjust the brakes or gears yourself. Basically this is a childs bike made to look like an adults bike. I'm 5 foot 10 inches and this bike is way too small. Spending money on a bike like this is a waste of time. [...]"
4,Model T of bicycles,"First, this is a ""branded"" bike made by a firm called Pacific Cycle. Pacific Cycle mass produces bikes and sells them under a variety of names, including Mongoose, through variety of retailers. That's not necessarily a bad thing; it just depends on what you need. This bike is perfect for riding around town. It's light, reasonably durable, and comfortable. I've owned it (actually, I own the Walmart version which is virtually identical) for nearly 3 years and haven't had any serious problems or defects. I primarily use it in an urban setting (roads, sidewalks, curbs, pot holes, etc), and occasionally take it through parks and bicycle trails. The bike excels at these uses, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a serious, off-road/trail bike - it just isn't made to withstand that kind of stress. In short, if you want a real off-road bike, go to a bicycle shop and pay 400+ dollars, but if all you need is a bike to get around town then buy this one."
2,Not the best Bike,I have had this bike for over a month now. It seemed to be working well initially but i would not recommend it to anyone who is planning too ride the bike off-road. Th gears need to be tweaked.... one of the peddle broke ... literally .. split in two ... and i never dropped the bike or anything so can't say much about the quality... it is also heavy so dont expect to be biking uphill in this.But if you want a bike to ride in flat terrain ... for a mile or so every day .. then its not bad.
2,Somewhat unhappy with purchase,"First off, I was happy when I noticed the dual-boxed shipping that was done to help keep the bike from getting scratched. Then, after pulling the bike out of the box, I noticed some nice scrapes on the fork of the bike from where the handle bars were hanging when it was shipped. Also, on further inspection, I found some other paint scrapes on the back of the body as well. Also, after placing the front wheel on and checking if it spun straight, I noticed that it was way off. Basically, it wobbles. Fixing this either requires a trip to a bike store, or purchasing a spoke wrench to fix it myself if I understand correctly. This shouldn't have come like that in my opinion. This may get shipped back to amazon at this rate. Also spent an hour trying to get the shifter adjusted so it would work in all 21 gears. I appreciate that most of it was preassembled but come on. At least do it right."
3,Little things make a BIG difference,"I would like to describe the wonderful riding experience, but I am waiting to correct an assembly problem.The tiny 2.5 mm allen screw that keeps the shifter on the handlebar is stripped. I sent away for a product called ""screwgrab."" I'm still waiting...........I'm willing to bet it's a nice bike."
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This bike is horrible. The front shocks don't even work, and neither the rear shocks. No wonder why it's so cheap. For Christmas i got a Marin Rift Zone which is an amazing bike but it costs alot. But the Marin has Manitou front shocks, and Fox rear shocks with great disk brakes. If you're serious about mountainn biking like i am get a real full-suspension bike like a Marin,Iron Horse,Kona,or Santa Cruz."
5,AWESOME,This is probably the best I have ever owned. Great bike great price.Bike is well made and very durable.
2,Bad decision,"I would say, it was bad decision, although I got it under $100. (That's why I give one more star)The box was open when I got it. The rear reflector was broken.In addition, the front gear never shifts to 3.I didn't want to spend extra $25 to fix the problem.So, I'm enjoying (?) full 14 speeds now -.-Oh, one more! In my opinion, the bike has bad seat cushion."
1,Thought I had to at this price - wishing I hadn't,"For $30, I figured I'd buy it and donate it to Toys for Tots. I had no idea how difficult it would be to get this thing assembled and adjusted and, several hours later, wish I'd never bought it."
4,great bike (Mongoose Domain 26-inch dual-suspension mtn bike),I order this bike online from Amazon and less than 5 days I have recieved the bike in the box (2 boxes). The bike is a brand new and excellent condition nothing else is damaged which due to the shipment. This bike is very light weight about 35 pound or less after completely assymble and It is very easy to do assymbly too.
2,"Good bike, terrible components","Received my shinning new bike, excitement, opened the box, assembled the parts, inflated the tires, checked the chain, joy, mounted it for my first ride, emotion, put my feet on the pedals, fresh air, good weather at 75F, happiness, started pedaling.... suddenly... loud CRACK!!!... WTF?... something fell off, pedals loosed, the ride stopped... now sadness, anger, rage.... damn!What happened is that the Rear Derailleur (SRAM 3.0) simply broke for no reason. I'm a 5'7, 185 lbs non-athletic couch potato and there's no way I could have caused this breaking by just pedaling. Check the images I uploaded of the broken derailleur. (Customers Images)This is definitively a case of bad quality plastic components used in an expensive product. I've seen cheaper bikes at local retailers (WMT, TGT, KMT) with better Shimano components.Now, who I have to direct my complaints to?, Amazon?, Mongoose?, SRAM?Who's going to respond for it?"
2,ok for the price,I didn't like the handling of the bike itself. The steering seemed a bit off. The quality of the bike itself is just ok. The price is the real attractor for buying it.
3,mongoose domain,The bike did not come in perfect condition. One of the forks had a 2.5 in scratch on it. The seat was slightly torn. The large gear would not go into 3rd gear. I had to adjust the bike. The bike does ride well.
5,An excellent book,"I feel the author was conise and backed his claims with facts. I read Greenhead Politics approximately 2 years ago. It just came back to me after being passed around to friends and I plan to read it again. Personally, I can't wait for a book such as this to be written about all the corruption in Atlantic City over the past 25 years."
1,Its still only 1/2 of the story...,"All stories have 2 sides...I believe, in between the 2 sides there is the truth. Obviously this man lost nothing in the long run with a million dollars in his pocket, and apparently a rather large chip on his shoulder that hasn't seemed to dissapate over the years. It seems he is the one wanting to continually profit over ""Corruption"". Where are you donating these proceeds to?"
1,Stay away from this unit,"I bought this unit about two years ago, only used a couple of time, then the pilot light won't stay on, asked the service guy to come out, he had to replace the whole assembly unit. worked last summer, then winter came, before storing it in my garage, tried the pilot light, it did not stay on. I thought it was because of the moisture. So went ahead and store it in the garage. The unit never work properly. Such a waste of money. Just buy a cheap one from Costco or Home Depot, so when it goes bad, you won't feel hurt."
4,good tunes,"This an okay album..good have been better but i did come across 3 songs that are now in my top 20 for favourites,K-Jon-Miami I love that and so do my lady friends,Pitbull-Oye oye,another good song if ya wanna pull some pimped moves on a lady,Smoothed of em all 8ball-throw your hands in the air its damn good beat"
2,Same old luda.............,"really i thought this album was weak really all the songs [were] pretty bad. the only song i liked was act a fool, but that song is getting pretty old really fast."
4,Lets go Minaaaage!!,"This Soundtrack is sic. I gave it 4 stars bc there was no Ja Rule on it hahaha. Furious by Ja Rule and Act a Fool are 2 hardcore songs to bump when you out Rice Huntin. But ya I like the cd and hopefully I wont be the only one bumpin it.Off Topic, It's funny how people that hate this movie and anything that has to do with The Fast and The Furious, are still gonna go see it. I can't wait to see all the Hardcore Ricers at the mall. I'll be looking forward to seeing all you Ricers in East County. Catch ya later Mang."
1,2 fast 2 furious cd,"Did receive on a timely basis, thought there would be more soundtracks that I would like. Only two songs were good. Don't waste your money."
4,there's a song in the movie that's not on the CD...,"dude, the movie was BOMB, but there's a song in the movie that i really wanna download. it has lyrics like, ""...on the floor, on the floor..."". that's all i could remember. can y'all help me figure out what that song is? i really want it and it's driving me nuts!"
5,GREAT,"everything with this movie is great! the music is great, the movie was great and paul walker was great! i was reading the reviews and many people were asking about the song that played when brian o'conner pulled up in the skyline. i'm not sure if this was the song you were talking about, it goes ""like a pimp dawg on the floor on the floor..."" the song is called ""like a pimp"" by David Banner. I hope this was helpful!"
5,Perfect for the Ultimate Racer....,"This CD has a lot of hot songs, like the cover song by Ludacris - Act A Fool. This CD has the bests songs to drive too in your phat ride, such as myself. I recommend this CD to anyone who loves fast music, fast cars, and 2 Fast 2 Furious!!!"
2,Aight But Can Get Better,"The album had alot of the same artists like Disturbing the Peace artists and the songs were not at all helping the movie. The hottest song on the album was ""Rollin' On 20's"" by Lil Flip and it was not even played in the movie. Ahead of that the movie had ""Like A Pimp"" by David Banner featuring Lil Flip and that song was not even on the soundtrack. The album was boring in my eyes and it could get better if it had other artists like Jay-Z, Eminem, etc. I prefer Cradle 2 The Grave Soundtrack over this one."
4,Missing Song,"Great cd! But would have def earned 5 stars if the soundtrack included the best song in the movie. It took me forever to figure out what the first song in the movie was. If it helps anyone else i believe it's david banner and lil flip - get down like a .... the album is def worth buying, but download the lil flip song."
4,2 Fast 2 Furious,The soundtrack was awesome. There were a good bit of unamed artist that came out w/ great songs on this soundtrack. oOBlack96731Oo the song you might be thinkin about is Like A Pimp by Lil Flip
2,LUDA-WHO???,"I can't believe that people actually like this disc, there are a heep of nobody's on here.The 2 stars are for Fat Joe & 8-Ball,8-Ball's ""Hands In The Air"" tightest track he ever made!!! I've never even heard of half of these artists!Dead Prez have a tight one on here also but other than that ,don't waste your money...oh unless your a LUDACRIS fan than this [material] is right up your alley. Scarface should have left him where he found him.The first Soundtrack was way better.I'm sure the movie blows just like the soundtrack on this one."
1,Love and Sorrow,When I received them I absolutly loved them. They are the most gorgeous dishes I have ever owned. When I put them in the microwave and dishwasher I was with great sorrow to find that they are not microwave and dishwasher safe as is stated on the description. I put them through the dishwasher and the clear glaze that covers the pretty hand painted dishware now has crackes all through the cups and dishes. I am extremly disappointed.
1,Do NOT microwave,"These dishes say they are microwave safe, how if you don't use a pot holder you sure to burn you hand.Helene Jeffrey"
5,Blues Heaven,"It sounded interesting, and the other reviewers gave some good praise, so I went ahead and bought it.Ladies and gents, I'm glad I did. Listening to many of the tracks, it's hard to believe they weren't ORIGINALLY blues! The renditions are so pure, so well done -- if you like blues, you'll love this collection.I'm now going to try some of the other ""This Ain't No Tribute"" series... I hope they're as good!"
4,Black & Blue,"Great music and really rewarding hearing black blues artists brilliantly cover white British rockers. I'm a fan of all the artists involved, including Led Zepplin, but the sense of poetic justice makes this even more enjoyable."
3,Great jazz vocalist,"The big negative of Irene Reids CDs on the Savant label is the fact that there are only 8 lousy tunes on them, when there should be 12 to 14. That is the reason I only give it 3 stars. I would have never bought it new because of pricing.Vocalists who are trying to make the switch to jazz and blues should check Irene Reid out. Her years of experience will give you a good start. Keep in mind when you listen that she is in her 60s!! Her musicians are top notch players as well. You won't find any electronic 'help' here. These are all live players.I personally bought the CD because I am a vocalist and wanted to create a MIDI sequence of her version of Mose Allison's ""Your Mind Is On Vacation"" to perform to. You too will love this blus tune. The lyrics are a crack up! I will probably go ahead and make myself learn a couple more of the tunes to make it worth the price I paid."
2,Missing the Meat off of the Bone,"This ""Sampler"" might have her singles, but you're still missing songs that did not get the credit they deserve, like Call, my favorite song off of her debut. I like it that they to took away those boring skits. Dreams and Movies could have been replaced with Call and Rescue to make it sound better. That's why this cd gets a two instead of four!!!"
4,Song during credits,"Does anybody the name of the song that plays during the opening credits, where they're dancing and all the funky colors are popping up?I thought it was Shooting Star by Eart, Wind & Fire but I don't see it on the soundtrack...Thanks!Overall, great soundtrack! Good classics for a hit new movie!"
5,Superbad Soundtrack,This is a hilarious movie with an awesome '70's funk soundtrack. The coolest part is that the new music created for the film matches the retro tracks used in the movie. Truly inspired! Nice job by everyone involved.
2,Where's the real soundtrack?,"Uh, this soundtrack has all the backing funk music which is cool, but it lacks all the songs that you might actually remember and made the movie so great.Its missing: Panama by Van Halen, the dance song with Seth and the bloody leg, Notorious BIG's, These Eyes, etc.Don't buy this unless you know what you are getting - a lot of funk by one artist, not the soundtrack you were hoping for."
2,Not that useful,"I studied Latin a long time ago and picked up Wheelock's. I added this book as an impulse buy based on some feedback. I find it adds nothing at all to the information in Wheelock. A lot of the suggestions are trite and much of the content is condescending.I can see that this book might be useful to one who lacks background in grammar in general (not specifically Latin grammar) and would benefit from context for parts of sentences. For anyone with a high school or higher education, it's likely useless."
3,Required Reading for Wheelock's Latin,Dr. Grote's textbook is a perfect guide for getting the most out of Wheelock's Latin. He makes understanding the important aspects of each chapter clear and easily managed so that the student gains confidence and understanding as he progresses through the book. I take his online course and have found this book makes Wheelock a pleasant read rather than the chore Latin can be. The book fulfills Wheelock's goal of making the student eager to read Latin for pleasure. The first 20 chapters alone are worth the price of the book. Don't pass this one up!
1,Poor Design and Poor Performance,"I had the SB600, which was supposed to be the top of the line, commercial spreader because I have a huge lawn. I used this spreader for several years and had LOTS of problems with it. It was heavy and hard to push, it was constantly jamming, so I was having to take all of the fertilizer out of it to clear the openings. The control for the spreader were constantly jamming and the thing was just a piece of junk, really, for the price I paid. I was very disappointed to say the least. The good news is that we had a fire in our barn and the thing got burned up so I can get a new one. I definitely will not get a product made by this company. Shame on you for putting out such junk at these prices."
2,CD-Rs are very inexpensive to produce,"As with all the recordings in the Detaching The World series, this is excellent music for bodywork. However, CD-Rs are very inexpensive to produce, so I wonder why this item is priced the same as the other volumes that are sold in the higher quality CD format. My guess is they're going for consistency of pricing AND the extra profit per unit. If that sort of thing doesn't bother you and you're collecting the set, then you should go ahead and buy it."
2,Beware inaccuracies!,"While good for general ideas of where to ride, this book islittered with misleading information and inaccuracies. Clearlythe author has not done some of the rides, as distances aredouble those quoted in some cases (In one case the recommendedmap was listed with scale 1:25K, but the actual map available1:50K. All distances / times were double those suggested.).Some of the general mountain biking advice in the intro chaptersis questionable (eg: recommended shoes for riding, method fordescending steep hills, etc).The rides in the author's earlier book (NSW edition) appearto be better researched (but still not flawless). Perhaps thisbook is an attempt to 'cash in' on previous success?Books by this author are a running joke amongst numerous localmountain bikers.Great for inspiration, but use with caution!"
2,Unfortunate misleading book for young adults,This series leaves a discouraging view of Wicca as a religion that violates and can not be integrated with established western (Roman Catholic) religion. An unfortunate mistake that violates the true core of Wicca as the celebration of one true God/Goddess. Not appropriate for young readers who have not learned the true premiss of Wicca and its respect of nature.
1,all Sweep books,"i think these are terrible! they are not even good and the whole concept of witches is bad! people who really get into these books may become fanatics and stray from the right path! i think someone should put a stop to cate tiernan's books about witches and that nonsense! i can't believe i even read those books! it may draw many people to it, but that means nothing. she makes the characters have bad morals and children can learn bad things from that! (these books are in the young youth section!) any person can get a hold of these terrible awful books! i would give it zero or negative stars but there is not option for that on here! these are going to be the next set of banned books from the libraries, rather, the whole world!"
4,Awesome Book!,"This was an excellent book, but not good enough for 5 stars. It made you really think about who you were, and what you needed to do with your life and it also makes you think about who you should really trust with those most personal secrets that everyone knows and loves. I recommend this book to anyone who likes intense books and also somewhat sad."
4,A Good Easy Read,"This series is a good easy read. The plot and characters are interesting enough to keep you turning the pages, and on to the next book."
2,Unhappy with product,"This video is extremely poor quality - the picture is blurry, the sound is distorted, the persons giving the history of the subject were terrible! I only watched about 15 minutes and gave up on it getting any better. This item should be removed from your library. I ordered it because I had seen a similar documentary on PBS which was very good but, sorry to say, this video was worthless."
2,Disappointed,"The only reason I was disappointed is because of the narration on these discs. It is very monotone, mundane and truly got on my nerves. The information is interesting and informative, just needs a better narrator."
4,Great Roots Rock/ Power Pop Disc,"This is a great sophmore effort from Walter Clevenger and his Dairy Kings. The sound here is in the Marshall Crenshaw/Nick Lowe vain--with a good bit of Buddy Holly thrown in for good measure. If you like any of those artists (and by gosh, you should), you won't be disappointed. In my book, it's better than his first disc."
5,A TRUE LISTENING PLEASURE,"Walter Clevenger and The Dairy Kings really outdid themselves this time. Walter's last album, The Man With The X-Ray Eyes, was great, but the follow up to it, Love Songs To Myself is incredible. There is not a song on this album that you won't enjoy listening to. It was a wait, but it was worth it to get my hands on this. I can't recommend this enough to anyone who has the last album or to anyone who has never heard Walter Clevenger and the Dairy Kings before. Grab it quick, these guys are on their way to the top."
5,Incredible,Haunting--this book is raw and hontest. I can't get it off my mind. Will be visiting friends doing VSO in northern Ghana soon and am trying to get a copy for them as well.
1,A book of little inherent value.,"I have to disagree with every review written about this book thusfar. It is not well written, for one. The style is amateurish, and it has little substance.But that's not what really bothers me about this book. What really bothers me is that he writes about soliciting a prostitute that he describes as having a ""twelve-year-old's body."" Another thing that bothered me was that George Packer dropped out of the Peace Corps without even telling his so-called friends in the village that he was leaving. He wasted the opportunity that was given to him, wrote a mediocre book about it, and yet reviewers come on Amazon.com and laud it.Want some free advice? Read any other book about Africa, Togo, or the Peace Corps instead. This one is not very good."
2,Not very useful-not for foodies,"I expected more from this book. The author provides some generic information and some of what I would call ""fillers"" (useless information to fill the pages) such as how to say something in different languages. In addition some information she provided especially about wine was not correct. In general the information was somewhat shallow and not anything new. It also appears that she underestimates the readers. I did not learn anything reading this book.I would not recommend this book."
3,"A great game, a decent video","I was expecting a little more in terms of history and clips of Nolan throughout his career. Thankfully though, the other reviews altered me to the fact that it's basically a tape of the game... I'm here to ditto those comments. It's basically a nice copy of the televised game with not much more."
3,good product - but wrong product,"I am keeping the item because the price was good and it can be used on another vehicle, but it would not fit on the vehicle it was ordered for even though this model and year was shown on the list."
2,Truffle Salt Dissapoints,My great hopes for this truffle salt were dashed away with its strong chemical aftertaste. The kind that lingers for hours after the meal. Even my wife concurred.
5,Amazing!,This stuff smells amazing! The flavor is out of this world. You don't need a lot so use sparingly. I use to flavor veggies that I have roasted in the oven. Great purchase.
2,An okay album,When I 1st heard Hotel I said to my self i must get this album. The after listening to the whole album i was fairly dissapointed at cas. Heres my ranking:1- My interruption 3/102- Hotel 8.5/103- Lipstick 10/10 (the best song on this album)4- Get no Better 6/105- Make u scream 2/106- Tha problem (skit) 9.5/10 (very funny)7- Tha problem 0.5/108- Pop That Cannon 3/109- Blood pressure 5/1010- Can i Talk 2 U 4/1011- Real talk (skit) 6/1012- Real talk 4.5/1013- Husslin 7/1014- Im hungry 2/1015- Around the World- 7.5/1016- Hotel Remix- 8/10
5,A delightful page-turner,"I could not put ""Vase"" down, it was so compelling. Cathy Elliott made her characters came alive. I feel like I know them and I care about them. Thea is such a real person - quirky and likeable. I can't wait to read more of her adventures."
4,Four Star,"The 9"" plate was in perfect condition. The mixing bowls each had a few raised white bubbles on them. I have returned them for replacement."
3,Mistake?,Is there a mistake in the price on this item (maybe it is for a set?) or is the Scarlet color really $30 for one plate when the other colors are only about $12 each?
1,piece of junk...,we brought this knowing it was a very cheap toaster..but to last 3 months with light use...only does one side of the item...JUNK......follow up ..made contact with the MFG. REP/DIST which is Jarden and they asked for the date code and the problem ..said they were gonna replace it and sent me a confirmation notice to that effect...will see how the replacement works...
4,Rival 2-slice Toaster,Toaster works great! The only drawback I could find was the cord is somewhat to short. Otherwise this is a great toaster!
4,Rival 2-Slice Toaster - Black,"My toaster is black, but I don't see it here on Amazon, so I'll review the white one (they're identical models except for the color).This toaster does the job, bottom line. I make and eat toast maybe once every three years, so I literally had to dust off my toaster tonight. I bought this thing back in 2006 and have used it maybe three times. It works great. The toast comes out nice and toasty. A knob lets you control the heat setting. A button lets you eject the toast at any time.I recommend this product."
3,Mixed review,"They were cheap when I got them.Good sound quality.But not adjustable laterally, so if you've got the wrong sized head, it could be a problem.I think I have a normal-sized head and they pressed too much on my ears.Very comfortable at first, but then my ears ended up hurting after a couple of hours.Also, the thin layer of leathery material of the earpieces wore out sooner than I would expect, flaking away to expose the foam underneath."
2,Not worth the money!!,"I received my first Screwpull nearly 10 years ago as a gift. It lasted five years and then broke in half at the metal housing through which the corkscrew is threaded. I purchased another and it lasted 2 1/2 years before it broke in half at the same place. Thinking maybe I had purchased a lemon, I tried again but this time, the device only lasted 18 months before it broke (same place, same story). Great idea here, but poor execution and quality control."
1,Screwpull broke after 3 bottles opened.,"Unfortunately, our new Screwpull broke after only 3 bottles were opened, unlike our original Screwpull that lasted for 12 years. It also appeared to be of flimsier construction than our original one. I mistakenly assumed that the company we bought it from (Winestuff) would handle the issue but all they did was refer us to the maker of the Screwpull in the United States. We were told to send it back to them and they would either repair or replace it. I sent it back to the maker over 3 weeks ago and am still awaiting either a repaired one or hopefully a new one. Note: The same day I wrote this review a brand new Screwpull in an unopened box arrived. Le Creuset does a good job of following up on the customer service end."
1,Not made as well as the Screwpull lever of several years ago,"Bought this screwpull as a Valentine's Day gift for my husband this year as he has one in our apartment in Miami. The new screwpull is made of plastic and not nearly as well made as the model he has from several years ago. He used it once and the second time, it wouldn't open the bottle. He pressed down on the plastic top piece which broke right off making the screwpull useless. I contacted the vendor who graciously agreed to replace it but I have not yet received the replacement. My guess is like most of the products we buy today, they are never made as solid and long-lasting as in previous years. This particular model is supposed to be the best on the market; not impressed and would not buy again."
3,"Not bad, could be better","To cut to the chase, I expected better from Le Creuset.It works fairly well for now, but with all the plastic I'm dubious about its longevity.Also, it seems, ""sloppy"" in the sense that nothing feels precise or smooth or well-machined. When the cork is extracted, I can see the screw bend and I don't know how much of that it will withstand. But we'll see; I could be wrong. I'll update this as need be."
1,Screwpull Classic Lever,It stopped working correctly about the 5th time I used it. When I pulled up on the lever the corkscrew spun out of the cork rather than extracting the cork. When you spend over $80 for a corkscrew you expect it to work!!
3,Pot-metal Construction of Key Metal Parts,"I've used this opener for slightly more than a year and it recently broke opening a dense cork. It doesn't work well on plastic corks, requiring considerable effort and the corkscrew often changes its path due to the resistance of the dense plastic corks.When the unit broke, I could see pot metal instead of solid metal. Evidently the manufacturers didn't learn much from the Titanic's cheap pot metal rivets but a buyer has no way to discern whether the metal is solid steel or cheap pot metal.I will pass on replacing my opener with an identical replacement. I've had better luck with German steel openers although they require more effort. At least they can go through dense plastic sealers."
3,Flimsy Construction,"Operates well, so far but the flimsy feel doesn't promise a long, useful life. It's mostly cheaper plastic rather than more durable metal."
2,Broken and Unrepairable,"When this unit worked it was great. About 3 years after we purchased it, problems began. First, the lever would not put pressure on the cork so the cork needed to be removed by hand. Then it started pushing the cork into the bottle rather pulling it out - the screw would not turn as it went in.I notice that there are broken peices of what may be a stop in the recesses of the body, but no easily replaceablepieces, no parts list, no suggestions other than replace the screw.My concern is that plastic corks require greater driving force (they are harder) and therefore may break these devices.We took it back to Williams and Sonoma and they said what a shame. Buy another.I was happy to see other reviewers have had good luck with Le Creuset warranty repair."
5,"Articulate, Witty, Practical Guide to Media Relations","This straightforward, realistic guide to media relations is a must read for anyone who has ever felt the trepidation of facing a query from the press, a customer or co-worker at a meeting.Ian and George use practical examples to support their lessons, and a good measure of humour to make this an enjoyable read."
2,A little too artsy,"There's some good tips in this book, but you're going to have to pick them out from the fictious, futuristic story it is oddly set against."
4,When Mom meets Dad,"Fun read with interesting twists. It was kind of predictable, given the genre, but I enjoyed it. Hope you enjoy the free read."
2,Sappy and sexy,"The sex scenes and the sensual tension are out of place. The book is sappy and predictable. In particular, the fall in the creek and its role in the relationship can be foreseen a mile away. More humor and less sex would have made for a better book."
4,Sweet Romance,"Two friends, aged 9 conspired to get their father and mother, who are both single parents to start dating each other. A derivative of ""The Parent Trap"", it's a sweet romance from beginning to end.And as you have guessed, this book is PG due to a very limited sexual scenarios that were mostly alluded to."
1,Not Enough Storage Space,"I like that there is a carry case for the Stiletto, but where can I store the antenna headphones? They're too big to fit in the case. I was very dissapointed, but at least I can carry some of the accessories. The whole purpose of me buying this was so I could store the antenna headphones; I love my portable live Sirius radio."
4,Spooky Fun,"Okay so it's not exactly collegiate literature, but if you like San Diego, and have even a passing interest in ghost stories, this book is great fun. From Hotel del Coronado to room 309 at the Horton Grand, Villa Montezuma, the Whaley House, even margarita-laden Casa de Bandini, they're all in there...but don't read it when you're home alone at night!"
3,Not for beginners.,It goes a little too fast for beginners. She transitions were very fast without as much repetition as I would like.
3,"Step OK, Dance too easy","I quite like the step portion of this video. Nekea Brown was fine as an instructor. The step moves were straight forward and I worked up a sweat by powering up the moves.The dance section was way too easy and I didn't feel like I was exercising. It was very short - 20 mins I think.I felt like the step portion was beginner to intermediate but the dance was definitely ""Absolute Beginners""."
1,Not what I exspected,I thought it was for beginner but it wasn't what I exspected there was not enough instruction the steps were not easy to learn and it didn't fit my needs.
4,Great!!,This is a really good workout DVD. This dvd really works you out for beginner. Its 30 minutes and gets you to moving which is what I was looking for. I had to take a couple breaks in the beginning but now I can do the whole 30 minutes without a break. I would really love to have her intermediate dvd. Music could be a little louder but as far as the workout goes....very good.
4,Great for us beginners,"My sister and I are determined to workout more. Until now we had just been walking/jogging and not getting heart rate up enough. We are both klutzes and this is just the right pace for us. Eventually I will get bored, but that is true of any video. This was a great place for us to start with step - clear verbal instruction and simple progressions. Not fancy, just basic"
2,sound defective on DVD,"Unfortunately, the sound is defective on the workout so you cannot hear her instructions, only music. This would be ok once you have learned the directives."
1,Not for beginners!,"Both the dance and step program start with moves that are not appropriate for a true beginner. Had I seen even 30 seconds of this video, I would not have ordered it."
2,Would be great if it had audio!,"I was eager to use this video after reading its reviews and discovering my local library has it. Heck yeah I'll try this video for free before I buy. It was hard to hear her talking on the instructional portion, but when I turned on the step portion, there was ZERO audio from her at all. Just the music. I cranked up my tv volume hoping I could hear her quietly but it was no avail. Its like the mic wasn't working at all, and they said hey what the heck no one likes the talking anyway and made the video without it. Since I haven't done step aerobics in 10 years, I was looking forward to a beginning video but without knowing what she's doing or having any cues, I was very disappointed. I'll try it a few more times (hey, I've got it for 3 weeks) but I would return this if I had paid for it. I only give it 2 stars because it looked like a great video.... but looking was all I got!"
3,They are not kidding!,"I took a beginning ballroom class in high school - 11 years ago. The steps in this video are SO easy that I already knew them. It is truly for someone who has NEVER danced. But if I follow it, I do get my heart rate up, it's quite repetitive and a little boring, honestly."
2,Looks and feels like cheap replica,"I own couple of real SWISS made watches. I ordered this watch as a present as it looked great on pictures and specs were outstanding. The price seemed right also...well, when the watch arrived (thanks to Amazon Prime in just two days) I was dissapointed. The watch looked and felt cheap, like one of those replicas that one can buy on busy streets of Manhattan. Lesson learned - if it look too good to be true, it IS NOT. If you are looking for $100-250 good quality water resistant watch, look for well known brands like Seiko, Citizen or Timex."
3,tHE PUPPET MASTERS,I HAVE READ THE BOOK AND SEEN THE MOVIE I JUST WANTED TO ADD IT TO MY COLLECTIONSO THAT I CAN WATCH IT WHENEVER I WANT
3,"Pass the cheese, please.","It would be easy to call this movie a complete bust and give it 1 star. On the other hand it would be easy to be fascinated by it and give it 5 stars. Objectively, however, I think 3 stars is fair. On the one hand, it tells a moderately interesting story on a shoestring budget and pulls it off, on the other, it shamelessly exploits every cliche of the alien invasion genre. Aliens that cling to your spine and make you a puppet. Unresolved father/son angst. Gratuitous display of a woman in her bra. Last-minute eureka to save civilization. Hurrah! No one has seen a case of overacting more blatant than Donald Sutherland's since Gene Wilder did Young Frankenstein, and Gene was going for the laughs. If I sound harsh about this, I don't mean to. Here is a movie that is at least entertaining, if not a strain to the mind, that you can watch with the kids. Heat up a Kraft Cheese Dinner and have this movie for dessert. I won't tell a soul you did."
4,Heilnein On Screen,"This is a movie of alien invasion through the control of humans. The aliens arrive in a flash of light that is witnessed by three boys (not two) who set off to see what is up.Enter Donald Sutherland as the head of a team investigating the phenomenon. They find a curious setup. The three kids are charging people to see the space ship. This is obviously not a real space ship, so what is going on?As we find out, we have been invaded by small aliens that attach themselves to the human nervous system and then control them. They are spreading quickly.The aliens are working at spreading their numbers as well as their influence. They try to sabotage Sutherland's team as well as aim at government officials.The aliens keep busy and the team keeps trying to contain and predict them. Witty lines and fast scenes keep the film moving to its surprising conclusion.A must for sci-fi and Heinlein fans. Great effects, neat monsters and a good story. Check it out."
1,Donald Owed Someone A Favor,"This ""B"" movie doesn't deserve the cult following most ""B"" movies command. Donald Sutherland must have owed the producers or directors a favor and was thus coerced into doing this movie. Fortunately, movies this bad don't ruin the careers of high-caliber actors like Donald. Only Road Runner cartoons are more predictable. Watch only for humor."
4,You won't sleep either!,"Want to get the feel of soldiering through the wars of the US from the Indian Wars to Viet Nam? Want to know what career disappointments do to a soldier Want to feel the frustrations of lost battles and lost loves? Want to feel the humiliations of the famous Buffalo Soldiers? Want to sense the curse that follows a soldier..the curse placed upon him by an old Indian shaman? Then, read and re-read ""Soldiers Never Sleep""!"
3,"Somewhat useful, but leaves a lot to be desired","Bloom's guidebook is only useful over the Toula guide ""Better Way to Die"" because it includes some new routes, mostly put up by Bloom himself. In fact the publication of his new routes seems to be the primary motivation for the guide since the directions to the routes are so poor in spots that I doubt Bloom has even been up to these routes. I used it for a week down there and found and climbed the routes, but was always frustrated with the pertinent information left out about locating the routes and wondered why he'd leave out such information in a GUIDEbook. His book has probably half the number of climbs as the Toula book, which has its own problems, but a new book to this area should have improved the local guidebook situation, otherwise, why write it? To promote your routes apparently."
5,"Excellent product only , little faut","This monitor is sweet, bright clear picture, big screen but small footprint, has better picture quality than most monitors, relatively lightweight and all this at such a low price! By the way absolutely no ghosting.CONS: Dingy speakers, very weak did not matter to me though how much sound do you expect from 1 inch speakers, I have speakers & a subwoofer however you can hear basic speech through them. No labels on buttons, but after using it twice you get used to it & last placement of the speaker jack, it took me 5 mins to find it & only after turning the monitor upside downOverall I rate this monitor very high because of value for money & the excellent picture quality which was what I bought it for anyway"
2,New Bunn Coffeemaker Stinks (literally),"For spending $100 on this machine, I didn't expect it to generate such bad smell for the first couple of weeks. According to Bunn, they switched to a new polymer, that off-gasses. Their recommendation: wait a while, and the smell will go away. Needless to say, I sent the unit back to Amazon."
1,terrible product,"I had a ten year old Braun cone type coffee maker which was getting on in years so I thoguth I'd by a BUNN coffee maker as a replacement. I was very disappointed in that I had to almost double the amount of coffee grounds needed to make a pot of coffee of comparable strenght to my old Braun plus it wasn't as good tasting. I put the new BUNN in storage and pulled out my old Braun coffee maker, I hope it last another ten years."
2,Low quality workmanship,"Bunn may make great coffee, but I never got to that stage. Received it one day two weeks ago, returned it the next. Swing cover to brew basket is flimsy and could easily break. Lid to pot was flimsy, and did not fit on the pot correctly; it was at an angle and would have had coffee rolling off the top. Finally, I did not like the idea of 200 degree water warming 24 hours a day. Believe that could be a hazzard I am not willing to chance, even when out of the house for a short time. To me, it's like leaving the stove on when not home.Amazon, however, took back the unit and promptly refunded my cost. Great to do business with them."
5,Love my Bunn!,A smooth cup of coffee in just a few minutes. The taste is so much better than the Mr. Coffee that I recently gave away. I will never own any other brand from now on. Try this one you will love it. Make sure to use the right filter.
2,"Inefficient, expensive, makes average/poor tasting coffee","I've had this Bunn coffee maker for about three years now and I'm about to get rid of it.First and foremost, it is very inefficient when it comes to energy use since it's always on and is constantly reheating the water all day and night. Sure, it makes a full pot in a minute, but how can that justify the energy use?I've experienced some electrical problems with this unit. The burner on/off light burned out within a few months, so there's no way of telling if the burner is on or off. I had to write ""on"" and ""off"" on either side of the switch with a sharpie.Most importantly, the taste of coffee this unit produces has deteriorated, though I never remember ever getting an exceptional pot of coffee from this machine to begin with. I get better tasting coffee from a small 6-cup, cheap Mr. Coffee unit that I bought in China than I ever have from this $100 machine."
4,A Bunn is still a Bunn,"We have had Bunn coffee makers for 30 years. The ""home-style"" last us about 8 years on the average but we do make a lot of coffee!! This one does a great job too. I have never understood why BUNN will not get their heads out of their Bunnz and make a residential server that pours as good as the commercial ones...true to form, this one will ""dribble"" if you are in a hurry or not reely careful!! They are economizing now by wanting us to use the server to put fresh water in the tank in lieu of a separate plastic pitcher that used to come with the brewer. It's still the best residential coffee brewer made!!"
2,Can't clean the basket that holds the filter and the grounds.,I don't know what kind of plastic they use but it cannot be cleaned! I tried everything from bleach to cleanser. I think it's the print from the newspaper that gets on it but it's white and looked awful. I wrote to Bunn - no response. I ended up throwing it away and getting a Cuisinart which I love.
2,Bunn,"The carafe top doesn't fit well. Water gets spilled all over the counter. The heater doesn't work well. We had another Bunn before this one, and this is not what we expected as a replacement."
4,Bunn has a good brew process,"My husband had this same coffee pot for several years, it stopped heating, but I still ordered the exact one again. It is what he likes the way the coffee tastes and the instant brew. I ordered a white one so it is more hidden on my kitchen counter.He couldn't wait for his 2nd one to be delivered, after having to use a spare of another brand we had on hand, Bunn has a excellent way of brewing a good cup of coffee."
2,Was disapointed with the coffee Caraf as it spills water and coffee when you try to poor with it.,It spills water all over when you try to fill the coffee machine. Also when you try to poor into a cup you have coffee all over the table. It dribbles and I can not get it to stop. It is like the spout Isn't large enough or deep enough to let the water or coffee poor fast enough and just comes out all around the spout of the Caraf.
5,Bunn coffee maker for the home,"We bought this coffeemaker to replace a previous Bunn coffee maker. We had the previous one for close to 20 years. We were very satisfied with it, but, it had begun to leak in the ""vacation"" mode. We were delighted to find we could purchase one in white with a stainless steel reservoir. The price at Amazon was less than anywhere else and we appreciated having it shipped free."
5,Bunn 10 cup coffe maker,"This is the best coffee maker we have had,very well built,fresh hot coffee in less than 3 minutes. Best thing we like about it and one of the reasons we bought it was because it is made in the U.S.A. That means alot to us."
1,Bunn Coffee Maker,"I am very disappointed in the item that I received. I have ordered from Amazon before and never had a problem. I ordered this NEW Bunn Coffee Maker to give as a gift and must have received a used one. Within a week of use the coffee maker showed signs of being totally limed up. Instead of a new coffee maker, I must have received a used one. I will be sending it back for a refund."
4,LOVE MY BUNN,THIS IS MY FOURTH HOME BUNN COFFEE MAKER PURCHASED IN THE LAST 20 YEARS - ALTHOUGH THE MODELS HAVE CHANGED THE CONVENIECE OF HAVING GOOD COFFEE IN UNDER 5 MINUTES HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BIG ATTRACTION - I HAVE NEVER HAD ONE FAIL - THE ONLY REASON I HAVE PURCHES NEW IS TO UPGRADE TO A NEW MODEL OR BUY AN EXTRA
1,Hate this coffee maker,"Bought this coffee maker because I thought Bunn would be a good brand. I hate it, if I wasn't so lazy I would have returned it. When I say ""it"", what I really mean is the the coffee pot itself and the container for the filter and coffee.The coffee pot is tiny! It says its 10 cups, but the coffee maker will really only let you get about 9 1/2 cups. The lip and the actual pouring of the coffee sucks too. I have to poor it over the sink. This is mentioned in previous reviews. I read them too, and still bought the damn thing. Its true, the coffee pot sucks.The container for the filter gets dirty when you make a full 10 cups, the groungs come all the way to the top of the filter and sometimes overflow.Seriouly, visually the coffee maker is cool, functionaly its a piece of crap. I wanted a ""nice"" coffee maker, we've had a Mr coffe for 6 years. The Mr coffee was better. It I didn't pay 100 dollars for this piece I'd go back to the Mr. Coffee."
2,BUNN - A mark of excellence?,"I bought this as a gift for my mother so I don't have personal experience but, I do have feedback from the my mother's home. The first thing is that the cover for the coffee pot is flimsy. Secondly it will do as it states, ""It will make 12 cups of coffee in 3 minutes"" but, it will not slow down the brewing process for fewer cups like other premium coffee makers. Thus the idea is good but the 'maker' needs a few more bells and whistles to bring it up to a standard of excellence that the name implies."
5,Pleased with Bunn,I have had two Bunn coffeemakers in forty years. The coffeemaker works quickly and is very durable. I am very pleased with my new one.
2,LOVE BUNN JUST NOT THIS ONE,I had A Bunn coffee pot for 16 years before this one worked great no problems. I broke the little lid on the top so thought I would just get a new one no big deal! Got the new one Bunn NHBX-W Contemporary 10 cup home coffee brewer. With in 2 years the light went out for the plate warmer and it leaks all over the counter. Called company the won't send the parts to fix it our self you have to send it in and who knows what they will charge? Plus the shipping. I will not buy this model of coffee pot again. Oh yeah and my Mom bought the same one her light for the heat plate went out too.Bunn makes fast great coffee in 3 minutes. Finding the right model that will last might be a problem. In any case I will try a different model. As for the company they were not helpful.If the next one gives this kind of trouble I am done.
5,Best Coffee Maker Ever Made,"Since my first Bunn coffeemaker, I'd never have any other. They are the best out there."
4,Besrt coffee ever.........,This is without a doubt the very best coffee maker made. Great coffee in about 2 minutes .
5,Improved Bunn,"This is my third Bunn. We drink a lot of coffee during the day, and we literally wore the other ones out. I like this one better than the last one--which had a plunger stop mechanism that depressed as the lid was closed--because this one seems easier to use. With the larger, round pour area, there are less spills than with the last model I had. I purchsed the ""white"" model because it was easier to see if there was coffee left in the pot with only a glance. The previous model was black, and I had to look closely to determine if there was coffee left or not. Like all the Bunns I've had, this one works rapidly and produces a good-tasting cup of coffee."
2,clean up daily :(,"Absolutely disappointingcant pour out of carafe without a total mess on counter top talk about frustrating...I would rather wait a couple minutes longer for brewing than to have half of it on my counter ... never will i own a Bunn again ,,, mistake ..."
4,Great Machine,I love having fresh coffee in just a few minutes! The only thing that gives me grief SOMETIMES is when the lid leaks. It doesn't happen often and it's easily fixed. It's probably more my problem than the machinces.
4,slower,"This Bunn is much slower than my last one, but still faster than almost all the other brands. The white color is very pretty. Cleans njcely."
1,Had to return it.,I tried them on but there was something digging in to my toes that I could feel through my sock! After putting my hand in the shoe I could tell that the way they were built leaves pieces of the hard synthetic fabric sticking out inside the shoe. Not for me. Amazon took them back but charged me freight both ways.
4,light weight and good looking..,I got this shoes from amazon for some 42 bucks...they are really good looking...grip is OK not the best....Open mesh nylon(not good during rain though)...overall a good deal for the given price...
2,Nice Shoes but a something is poking me...,Ok... I like the shoes but something on the left side of the shoes seem to hurt the top of my foot... I can't figure it out... I have searched the shoe but I think it is something in the manufacturing...
5,"The Coolest Shoes, Ventilation is the answer","These are the coolest shoes , that i have ever had , and at 57 years , i have had quite a few. The ventilation is real , and your feet never perspire , and i have never had a shoe ventilate as well as these ! A+ , 100 % John Hornsby"
3,"Good, not great","I'm a big fan of the Pied Pipers era Jo Stafford, but also like her solo work. I was excited to find this album on CD, since the tracks are all wonderful 'standards'. The first thing that bugs me, that didn't stand out when I gave it a quick listen on Amazon, is the orchestration. It's good, but there's something very 'dated' about it. I'm no musician, but I'm pretty sure I'm hearing an accordion on every track. That sound conjures up late 60's lounge, which I guess this kind of is. The other problem is, as a previous reviewer stated, the sound quality. It is clearly mastered from vinyl, which is fine since the original masters are probably long gone. It is something buyers should be aware of though. If you're listening with headphones, it's really evident. I'll play it often, but not as often as I would if it didn't have that bloody accordion accompanying every track!"
4,A great cell phone,My wife loves this phone.She had this phone for years tell it just wore out.Then I got her a new one just like her old onefor ChristmasThanks Amazon.Yogi
3,Why is this book so great?,"Cause I do not speak well english. Now I am learning. So, in the meantime, i will write the review in spanish: El libro está muy muy bueno, pero lo cierto es que sólo quiero los 50$. Un abrazo a los hermanos americanos."
1,No audio,The disc arrived quickly. However there is no audio just the picture and menu music more words more words more words
3,Ups and Downs,"This movie is bottom line ok...it grabbed my attention until around half way through the film then just became tiresome. The acting and cinematography were both well done and the extras on the dvd were packed and plentiful, but for me the shocks of the ""special"" baby just weren't enough to keep me interested. *SPOILER* After the audience was informed that the infant survived from drinking human blood there wasn't much else they could do to keep the story moving. Overall I didn't feel like this film was a complete waste of my time or not worth giving a view, but I wouldn't add it to my horror collection. The shock effect used was more predictable than disturbing."
2,Grace (2009)... Nothing saves this Grace,"Grace: 4 out of 10: If you create a shark attack movie at some point, you will need a shark attack. You can throw in tons of satire about progressive attitudes, over-bearing mother in laws, and maternal instincts. However, when all is said and done the shark has to show up.Grace is slow to start and continues never speeds up. The film ends a few scenes before it starts getting good. As a genre film, it is a sleepy disaster. As a political independent film it is simply okay.Grace has good acting, the world's cutest black cat, and some biting social commentary.What it lacks is a killer baby.Stick with It's Alive, which does all of the above (sans the cute cat) and yet delivers the goods at the end."
1,Really?,"Madeline, a vegan mother who has previously miscarried two times, is 31 weeks along in her pregnancy when she has an early delivery scare. Not long after, she is involved in an automobile accident. Her unborn baby is declared dead but she doesn't want induced labor or go to the hospital so she waits to deliver a stillborn. Baby Grace is willed back to life and appears to be a healthy happy newborn except for one thing...she needs to feed on blood to survive. The movie is mostly set in Madeline's house and is centered around breastfeeding. Vivian, the mother-in-law, has a breastfeeding obsession; she pumps her milk and wants custody of baby Grace.I can't help but wonder if the statement of Grace is, ""Vegans everywhere beware. Your infant may need to feed on blood when it's born since it will lack nutrients."" A horror flick? Really? I'm only horrified that I sat through this movie and wasted two hours."
2,Just plain weird,"Ok so all I can really say is it started off slow and continued to be slow and once you finally figured what was going on....it just got very, very weird... this is a very weird and not in a good way type of movie.. that was slow and boring through out the movie up until the last 15 mins or so of the movie but in the end... this was one strange movie, and again not in a good way."
4,DISURBING AND NIGHTMARE-ISH!,"Grace!....well... where do I begin? This film is truly disturbing. What starts out like a movie you might find on Lifetime, turns into a nightmare-ish and unsettling film about a mother's love for her new baby. When a baby miraculously survives what should have been a still birth, it soon goes from weird to bizarre and then to disgusting and twisted. I don't want to reveal any more of the film than I have to, so if you like sick and demented films this one is pretty out there and the production values are excellent with solid acting and effects."
3,Watchable and fairly entertaining,"I found this to be a watchable and fairly entertaing movie. When I first read the blurb, the first thought that came to mind was ""Rosemary's Baby"". It is not. The synopsis has pretty much been covered in the other reviews, so I will move to other aspects. The transfer could have been better as it wasn't the best I've seen nor, to be fair, the worst. The overall story is good. I think horror movie buffs may enjoy it, but I would recommend renting it, before commiting to adding it to your library."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of horror and this movie was bad horror on so many levels I lost count. Worst of all, it was pretentious, trying to be something artful (which it was not) at the expense of a good, coherent story. The characters were one dimensional and none of them were sympathetic. I literally could not wait for this movie to be over. The only horror I felt was repulsion, which can work in a horror movie, but not when it's for the filmmakers themselves and their inability to craft a decent piece of entertainment.The idea of a monster baby has, of course, been done before. So has almost everything else, but a new way of thinking, developing characters who are interesting and that we can care about, and adding some surprising twists can put a stamp of originality on the most tried and true formula. Unfortunately, GRACE, fails to do that."
4,Much better than you might imagine,"This is an atmospheric horror film about a young wife whose husband is lost in a car accident, after which their baby girl is supposedly born dead. But she doesn't stay that way for long. An undead baby is, shall we say, a challenge to take care of, given her special food needs. It really is a very heartbreaking story as well, as the mother gives of herself to try to sustain Grace, while attempting to keep others away.The acting is pretty strong overall, and it is certainly a more original concept than what we usually see."
4,Grace will get under your skin,This one will stay with you for a ong time.Not since the Exorsist has there been one that ts creepy and gory.Its disturbing and watch it knowing that bit of info.I noticed a few writers gave it 3 stars.Although the acting is ok i can see why.The lead woman played by Jordan Ladd is a dead ringer for kim basinger on drugs.She spends her time shuffling around like a rehab patient longing for the next fix.Its a gross little movie and no swearing.There was not one curse word in there....you know its not hollywood because if it were there would be the f-bomb dropped.Thankgod for small favors.Thank god for Grace!
2,Not what I expected - boring,"I don't usually watch horror flicks, but a couple of my friends enjoy them, so I thought I'd try Grace, which had an interesting premise.It had pretty good production values and good actors. That part I liked. And the baby (when they showed a real one) was cute. But frankly, I was bored. Yes, the baby wants blood to drink, but that's more creepy than scary. I didn't find much in the way horror or surprises. There wasn't much dialog, and the pacing was very slow. Much of the time I had the DVD playing at 2x speed with subtitles, so I could still see what little dialogue there was. It was mostly a waste of my precious free time."
1,"Not the least bit suspenseful, scary, or gross. A bore!!","I think Robin Quivers must get paid to mention movies on the Howard Stern show. She mentioned this stinker last week and I was dumb enough to watch the trailer and ignore all the negative reviews. It's just not very good. It's a great idea for a movie, but it's poorly executed. It's boring and not the least bit scary or shocking. The sub plots about the lesbian mid-wife and the breast-feeding obsessed mother-in-law aren't enough to save this movie. Avoid it."
2,Routine,"A fairly routine horror movie, modern variety, that is it emphasizes that which classic horror films of the past only suggested. To my knowledge, after showing at numerous film festivals, including Sundance, ""Grace"" never played theaters. That should give you a clue to its quality.The story involved a mother whose baby is stillborn. But . . . get this: it somehow manages to remain alive in the womb. Frankly, I found the events confusing at times, or maybe the movie just didn't hold my attention enough and several key points slipped past me. I will say this for ""Grace"": it's well produced, and competently acted. Die hard fans of modern horror movies may find this to their liking, but it just made me want to see ""Rosemary's Baby"" again.Brian W. Fairbanks"
2,Like bad yogurt,"On the surface - ooooo - sounds like a good living dead sort of film, zombie baby. I really wanted to like it, but implied (barely) zombie toddler but for a few peeks, and was just overly depressing and emotionally hysteric. I DO understand - that was the WHOLE point of this movie, to make you sort of live thru what you'd be like if this was your little tyke. But-this type of film really is one that, unless you are comfortable with lots of morbid emotionally charged elements and getting caught up in dirty dish-rag wringing out of emotions - I really encourage you to rent first, then if it appeals, consider a pruchase. This is not a slam at the production value, quality of the script, OR lack of decent actors - that is all rightly there - but it has all the ""feel"" of a little girl standing over her dead-run over dog in the street and arguing with the cop saying ""but Officer, that can't be my dog....Barkey doesn't have his guts hanging out of his mouth."""
1,Below Average,"If you are looking for a true horror film from Sundance Film Festival this is not it.Just Alot of hype for nothing.This has been done before so don`t expect too much in the way of horror has a small plot but still not worth viewing or buying if you are true fan of horror.CAN WE SAY GOOD MARKETING,I have a hard time believing people have fainted while watching this."
1,Can I have some toilet paper please?,"It seems someone was in the bathroom doing #2 and thought ""Hey, wouldn't it be cool if there was a movie where a woman gets pregnant and she gets into an accident and instead of removing her dead baby from her womb, she gives birth to it. Even though the baby is dead, it comes alive but it's not really alive because it's really a ZOMBIE BABY"" OMG, how is it that no one has ever thought of this?. And OMG, wait for it...the baby drinks blood instead of milk! So, like the smell that existed in that bathroom at that moment, this movie stinks. It's boring, silly and an incomplete thought. There's nothing new or interesting about it. This movie makes no sense and takes something that you would normally see as a miracle and turns it upside down without any explanation or cause. If you have common sense skip it, if you want to be shocked and need no plot-line or good writing then please rent this movie."
3,Use as coffee table book only,"The author uses many of her antiques to decorate the table which is nice if you own any yourself. Many ideas were very ""english"", maybe a little too elegant, not the kind of book for someone looking for different ideas using everyday items or at least items you can find in everyday stores. Nice coffee table book but not easy to recreate her tabletops."
2,useless,"This book has no useful information in it. The pictures are pretty, but I don't spend good money on a book just to look at the pictures. Even the ideas aren't all that creative. If I had cupboards full of antiques and drawers full of beautiful linens, I wouldn't need a book to tell me how to use them. Other, better books show the same techniques and ideas, and show them with materials more easily available to us mere mortals.The example that really did me in was the little girl's birthday party... with crocheted lace doilies on the drinks glasses, and all the little girls in Edwardian-style lace dresses. PLEASE! You want an example of a pretty child's birthday party, get the Shabby Chic entertaining book."
4,"Good basics, easy to follow","Great pictures and a great way to get started entertaining. Also, easy and inexpensive ideas wtih decoration (flowers, etc. you can get right from your own garden)"
2,No new ideas for a woman of culture,"I regret this purchase. As one reviewer said, this is just a coffetable book. It doesnt introduce any new idea to an educated woman. Who cant roll a napkin and tie a ribbon on it ??? It doesnt take a professional caterer to know that !!! Funny, but an out of print 1960's cookbook by Mary and Vincent Price ``A Treasury.....'' showed far more intricate, elegant, and exquisite napkin foldings. The utensils showed in Tabletops are not even for very dining ! Worse, an old item was made to pass off as an antique centerpiece and I am a professional antique collector. I lived in Europe and this book does not deserve space in any European home or library. What I saw here, I see frequently in crafts store windows in small towns. DONT BUY. I got instead ``Perfect Setting'' by Peri Wolfman (?) and finally, I got something intelligent with truly new ideas to captivate an intelligent woman. At best, give this book to a grade school kid."
5,Wonderful book!,This is the very best gift I could have given my mom as she is already a true Ohrbach fan!
3,Unusual,Positive:It's hard to describe this movie especially if the viewer's understanding of European settlement of the central and southern Americas is limited. A spanish matron settles into and develops a small Americas' fishing village and witnesses the interplay of folk religion with Christian Catholicism; black with white culture; contemporary hedonistic morals with traditional principled morals; superstition whether it's magic or faith and the consequences of pursuing one vs. the other.Negative:The narration of the story comes largely from the youngest members of the village; the outside threats of violence; the sunset and birds symbolism and ending made the story a little too obtuse and difficult to follow.
3,correction,"Hi Leslie, The effect with the 2 to 3 second delay is not the echo effect. it is normal with voice over ip (dialpad) that voices are delayed 2 to 3 seconds because of the packets travelling over the internet."
1,Didn't meet expectations,"My intent in purchasing this headset was to better utilize Dialpad.com's new internet telephone service.I had a cheap ($9.95) headset that I had used with voice recognition software and it was fine for that, but when I tried using them with Dialpad.com, the person I called would hear what they previously said 2 or 3 seconds after they said it... just as clearly as they would hear me.So, when I tried this new, more expensive headset... I expected a minimal ""echo"" effect.The net performance is that the more expensive headset has not performed any better than the inexpensive, generic type.If you choose these headsets, keep the packing material. You may want to return them."
3,Pretty good headset-- but there's an earpad problem,"This is a comfortable headset with above average sound. The catch is that Labtec/Logitech no longer has replacement earpads available. Once the pad wears out, all you can do is hope that you're going to be able to fit a generic ear pad over its somewhat unusual shape. Good luck."
4,they were a little mixed up,I was in Bco 3rd platoon and we were the first people to respond to help the scouts and they didn't even get that right. I am sorry you guys were not given credit. I remember Charlie Co being there brother you guys are not forgotten. To be honest all they interviewed was people from 3rd platoon mortars and scouts so that is why they are the heroes of the day.
1,Bad Version,"Bad Bad Bad... This version of Falstaff is totally wrong. All the voices are out of tone! Van Dam is terrible, villain. The pronounce of the singer is horrible. Solti is boombastic. Don't waste your money and skip to Karajan's Falstaff or Giulini (the best one)"
1,OMG! Smells like old lady powder,"What a mistake I made by buying this- I thought it had a light lavender fragrance that would be subtle and pleasant. Its totally not like that at all- and when I say ""old lady powder"" I don't mean powder that maybe an 80 or 90 year old might be wearing- but it smells like my grandmother's powder she wore in the nursing home about 20 years ago. I hate to be negative but it has a horrible odor that can't even be compared to bathroom spray. There are so many other powders out there that would give off a nice scent. For some reason I thought it might smell similar to Johnson's Baby Powder, or be an inexpensive option forCrabtree & Evelyn Lavender Dusting Powder 3.0oz./85gI was very wrong and I am returning it and just going with my new favorite powderClean Original Moisture Absorbent Fresh Body Veil - Clean - 107.7g/3.8oz"
3,This is NOT the version with the booklet!,"Although this has 78 sticks, like the 50+ year old set I got from my parents, it does not have the booklet of fortunes that came with that old set from ""The House of Joss."" Instead, it has the ""Your Luck for the Day"" part of the fortune printed on each stick.While somewhat entertaining, it completely misses out on the anticipation and fun of shaking the stick, reading the number, and finding the matching (and rhyming) fortune in the book, followed by your luck for the day."
2,Disappointing,"When I cracked this book open for the first time, I was shocked that most of the pages are empty workbook pages for the reader to fill in. Calling it a ""guide"" is misleading. In short, there's very little substance to this book; there are many others that are much more helpful and substantive (i.e., Farber)."
3,not what I thought,This is a good book but it wasn't for me. I know several people who have used Mr. Hawke's methods with some success. I just seem to be one of the people that it doesn't work for. Which the author does point out may happen.
1,Unless you want to be hanged...,"Although this may leaves many feeling confident in a new language, it most certainly is not enough to get around with.It's quite annoying to read this book, almost like watching people trying to use sticks as wheels. The author seems to think that knowing small bits of vocabulary in a language is fluency enough to carry on diplomatic conversations with natives.Basically, it says that for the most part grammar in all languages is in essence the same as in English, and that one need not learn much about it, and spend more time on the vocabulary.Well, in most languages, saying a literal translation of ""I need to go to the bathroom"" won't get you very far. If the natives /do/ understand, it will be at their expense (loss of time, energy, youthfulness, and brain cells)."
5,Great Book!,"For Begginners, Novices, Self Starters!For Americans who haven't been exposed to mulitple langauges.Not for Europeans who grew up around various tongues.For the language challenged, a great way to start!:-)"
2,It skims the bare minimum,"Reviewing this book and digesting its contents has concurred 2 things. First, if you need a quick guide, it hepls. But if you are looking for a quick solution. It doesnt meet that criteria.Ive checked out many types of language books, somehow i keep veering back to the kind that leaves a stronger in-print in my memory. Verbal practice and conditioning does wonders. The audio style books, work the best. Flipping pages have their limitations.So i would say no go for this book.aurorabooks(dot)net"
1,Nothing more than a glorified spreadsheet,"This book contains 97 pages of tables out of a total of 167 pages. There are tables filled with generic English adjectives, verbs, nouns, pronouns, and some vocabulary items. As the book is not meant as instruction for any specific langauge, the user is left to complete the tables with correspoding target language vocabulary. A fair percentage of the tables included in the book (~30%) are simply copies of blank tables from previous pages. This book offers nothing that could be considered a magic solution to learning any language. At best, the book provides a small amount of organization for the user to create a word list to study from."
5,f#ckin awesum band,"there comes an album every now and then that totally blows u away - an album that if ur house was burning down it would be one of the cds that u would grab. well this album is one of them and it is definitely in my top 10 or 20 out of my 400 plus cd collection. august burns red are nothing new (can be compared to heaps of bands - haste the day, killswitch, norma jean, the chariot, atreyu) but these guys know how to play their music. It is proberly a bonus that adam d also produced the album as he is a perfectionist for sound (killswitch sound is very precise and crisp). i bought this album today and i have listened to it at least 6 times already- freakin love it. best songs are 1,2,5,7,9 and number 11 is totally awesome. buy this album right now!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Simple review,"Love the music.Hate the lead vocals. (Screamo is fine by me, just not this screamo)The lyrics are terribly anemic. (Could learn alot from Becoming the Archetype)Give 4 stars for music alone; wish there was a music only version of this disc, then would be 5 stars."
5,Clean Quality and a fresh sound,"I never expected to like another christian band again after listening to Demon Hunter :\ However, these guys are one of the more technical metalcore bands out there, these guys have alot of talent and this is a CD that shouldn't be missed, and don't get put off by the fact that their christian, since it doesn't really matter as long as the music is good ;)Standout songs--------------Speeche ImpedimentToo Late For RosesBarbarian"
5,WTF??!!!!,"Why the F**K do these guys have to be soooooooo goood??? I cant stand it. Highlights are the opening track, Your Little Surburbia is In Ruins....pulse pounding double-bass, shattering riffs, amazing breakdowns....ohhhh the breakdowns!!!! Speech Impediment...see Your Little Surburbia Is In Ruins. Barbarian......INSANE intro riff. The Reflective Property....one of the best overall songs...EVER, I repeat EVER. Please buy the CD for yourself and i GUARENTEE you will not be disappointed. Again, I RARELY ever give 5 star ratings, but August Burns Red has definately earned it. Keep kicking ass guys!!!"
2,nothing that cant be fixed,"by first listen the band need time to develop. and that view hasnt changed. The arrangements are madly uneven and cluttered. Their far too hardcore influenced to be truely brute and too often the riffs fall into annoying off key notes. at times its brute and intense. for all its worht its got some decent breakdowns. at times its also confusing,mirroring Between the Bruied and Me one moment and then Norma Jean the next. Ill give them time though, since this is there first album, they have potential."
3,sigh... a sabre tip IS just folded metal,"I haven't ordered a sabre from these guys but I was just a little surprised to read the other review...previous comment ::: might need to by a rubber tip as the tip is just folded metal....???!are you a sabreur???? that is what a sabre blade has for a tip (ask your coach...plsplspls) ..... you DON'T put a rubber tip on the end of a sabre blade.... if you need to do so then it is probbly a foil blade, not a sabre blade....sounds like one of the standard chinese type guards that has a painted metal inside to make it an electric sabre guard..... all you need is a foil socket and a piece of wire and you have a working electric sabre (mind you an insulated pommel might be a good idea unless yu want to lose yuor bouts [at electric sabre of course that is])"
5,EXCELLENT DOCUMENTARY,"This is one of the best documentary's I have seen of a great blues artists. There are interviews with about anyone who's anybody in blues, it shows the compassion and love of the music of the man. Plus great interviews with John, you can really see what his music is all about and his style a must have."
1,Where's the mapping of battery to camcorder?,"What good is an on-line store selling camcorder batteries if it doesn't list which camcorders the batteries will fit? Energizer obviously doesn't sell camcorders, so there's a necessary mapping of battery to camcorder and Sony for instance isn't going to list whic Energizer batteries support it's cameras."
5,This herb gardening book is a must-have!,"This book is honestly my favorite gardening book - and I have quite a library! It includes basic information on both medicinal and culinary herbs, but what makes this book truly valuable is the information and advice it provides on artfully combining colors and textures. Malcom does an excellent job of combining beauty with herbal functionality. This book is overflowing with beautiful photos of plants combined in various themes, reflecting a variety of seasons and plant types. I've used several of the book's ideas to turn my garden into something really special! I highly recommend this book to every gardener!"
2,Echoing many previous sentiments,"So I want to echo what several have said here. We received this as a gift from our wedding registry in July. I am writing this review about 8 months later (although actually 6 months later as we didn't start using it until late August).The board developed cracks about a month and a half ago. Not just at the seams where the glue was, but in the wood grain itself. Looks horrible. My wife commented just now how warped the board is- and she's right. there is at least a half inch warping on each side.We wanted to buy this board because of the sustainable practices of the manufacturer, but unfortunately cannot recommend the board to anyone. Too bad- the thing really looks pretty in our kitchen from a distance."
2,Just okay,"I have owned this cutting board for just a little over two years. It does what it's suppose to do protect my counters and knives but as far as durability goes, it did warp and then regain its shape as mentioned in other posts. It is also started seperating in between the seams at the edge."
1,Warped and very oily,"I had a couple of issues. First, the cutting board arrived warped. After searching Catskill's website, I found a FAQ that suggested that weighting the board and waiting for it to acclimatize would correct this. Sadly, this did not happen for me. After weighting the board for 3 days, the warp had not changed much, so I decided to return it.I had other issues also. The board arrived well oiled---overly so, in my opinion. Picking up the board left my hands greasy and slippery. I was afraid that touching the board to my clothes would leave a grease stain. Maybe this amount of oil is common for maple boards, I don't know.Also, the oil had a subtle but distinct ""industrial"" smell. The smell transferred to my hands when I handled the board. Personally, I don't want the industrial smell in my food. I was planning on greasing the board with olive oil once I used it. I did not like the mineral oil used to oil the board."
5,Super writing!,"I've only read a small part of this huge book, but it's written in great writing style, and one of those books you KNOW you're going to love as a classic!"
2,Not that great,"This phone was given to me as a gift. It seemed to work ok for a while. Functionality is good, even though the sound on the outgoing and incoming messages is surprisingly fuzzy for a digital machine. But after only about a month of use, the receiver has a lot of static. The person on the other end of the phone cannot hear it, but it makes it very difficult to hear anything. Also, there were a lot of complaints from the people I was talking to that they had a hard time hearing me even though I would be talking in a normal tone of voice. This was even before the static problem started. Basically the phone portion is now useless, and I'm shopping for a new phone/answering machine. So, don't think this product is all that worth it unless you don't use this phone except for the answering machine."
4,Just buy his autobiography,"This was interesting, but everything in this book is also found in the autobiography of Lorenzo snow written by his sister Eliza snow which only costs $3,99. I just wasted $10 on this book thinking it would contain more info on the Italy mission."
4,Somewhat more than hello,"Of all the bands who are compared to Radiohead, The Bella Fayes come the closest to imitating the popular UK superstars. From Lael Alderman's inflectious falsetto/tenor to vocal counterpart, Adam Wayne's crashing guitars, ""So Much More Than Hello"" is straight out of the Bends, without all of the paparazzi.But who's to say this is a bad thing? While their lyrics are no where near profound, they have an easily digestible quality that integrates well with the music. Fortunately for them, their lyrics are also less muddled and disparaging than Radiohead's.Give this album a shot. It's a shorty (only six songs) but well worth it as a summer fling."
4,Good gospel singing,"I've been a fan of the Gatlin Brothers for about 20 years and I love gospel music. That's why I ordered this music. I have iton my Fire, so I can carry it with me wherever I go and enjoy the music. It's really great."
4,Malcom McDowell... Shudder!,"I think this is a great movie, but it has one very major flaw, Malcom McDowell. I personally do not like his acting in this movie whatsoever, it destroys the movie... Especially the end sequence, I hated it.If this movie did not have Malcom McDowell in it, I would have given it 5 stars. Paul Bettany and David Thewlis are awesome."
1,"Grotesque, mindless violence","This film deserves to have as little said about it as possible. It is endlessly and offensively brutal, bathed in mindless bloodshed. Unlike the excellent movie, ""The Long Good Friday,"" this tells us nothing about the protagonists, aside from the fact that they are depraved. We should be able to figure that out without help. Claiming to like this film because it offers insights is like claiming that a John Holmes film is essential to understanding the biology of reproduction. It is a lie that justifies a prurient interest in violence."
1,RUBBISH,"ANOTHER TIMES WASTER, CHRIST THIS FILM JUST DRAGS ON, MALCOLM MCDOWELL IS TOTALLY UNCONVINCING AS USUAL, HE WILL ALWAYS BE THE CREEP IN CALIGULAAND THAT TOSSER IN CLOCKWORK ORANGE.THIS FILM JUST SUCKS."
4,Its All About The Numero Uno,"First off...great f'n movie! I have a serious...serious...mafia collection, ranging from the Yakuza flicks (Japanese Mafia) to the Italians...but I never seemed to think about the brits...well, now I do. If you're a fan of mafia/gangster flicks...this is a must have, let alone a must watch. Now, if you're a fan of the ""make me actually think"" movies...then you'll like this movie also...for it pits one deep into the demented cranium of a killer (and some shot sequences, the eyes of a victim). Great movie...may take you a few times to see it though ;)"
4,Needs to get out more,If you can find this movie and you love the British gangster genre you are in for a treat. Worth seeking out. Better than Lock Stock or Snatch (sorry Madonna).
3,Gangster No.1,"The Older Malcom Mcdowell looks more sinister than the young one,and he kind of reminds me of a fatter Sting. I like some of the movie,I thought it too romanticized (Or English English=Romanticised).I think it's not the violence that makes it over the top,but the poetic narration that makes it such boring hyperbole at times, I was expecting much tougher looking Gangsters the likes Of Vinnie Jone's Character etc. It's worth a look though."
5,Red Line Lead Subsititute,Great us in my old 1962 Johnson 5 1/2 outboard motor... runs like a charm... It easy to use and stores in the shed good also.. I bought like 6 bottles of this becasue I fear some day sone it will be coming of the market for some govermental reason.. Great buy and worth the money.....
2,Not as advertised,"The product was not as advertised. Have already written a review for the person selling it. I guess the product was good, but not what I wanted."
1,Didn't do the trick,"I was hoping to alleviate the pain in my wrist and conserve some desktop real estate. I tried it out for a while and it did neither. The bridge just became more of an annoyance than a solution. Of course, everyone is different, so this my work out for someone else."
5,Great for the KIDS!,"My sons read this story a long time ago, we enjoyed this story..its one that stays with you after you close the book."
5,Nice cart,"This cart is exactly what I need. My old four wheeled cart rusted out. I'm writing this review as a cautionary note to those who might consider buying a four wheeled one. Most of those have hinged pull handles and small wheels. The small wheels add to the difficulty of pulling the cart, especially if one has a nice, lush lawn (which you probably have if you're investing in a hose cart). IF you have any amount of grade in your lawn the four wheeled carts tend to tip over, not from side to side, but from front to back, due to being top heavy, especially if you have a lot of hose. The hinged pull handle prevents you from doing anything to prevent this! The large two wheels and rigid handle with this cart make it easier to pull or push and prevent it from tipping over on a hill."
3,Worked well after getting broken parts replaced,"I bought this based on the good reviews of it. The hose reel cart arrived with two issues:1. A wrong leader hose (female threads on both end when it should have been one male and one female)2. Broken threads on one end of AxleCalled the manufacturer (not Amazon) and got the replacement parts fairly quickly. After assembling, everything seemed to be working well (a couple of weeks so far). The only thing to be tested is how well it will do against rust and leak (no leaks so far)."
3,OK but pricey,"This hose reel is sturdy enough, but the connectors restrict the flow of water drastically. It is pretty expensive."
5,Perfect for our use,"We live on a small hobby farm and need to provide water to horses in the winter. The large wheels on this cart make it easy to pull over rough icy terrain. The drum is smooth and easy to wind and unwind the 300 ft of hose that we use. We have only had it for a few months, but the construction seems very solid and it works really well."
2,Poor quality,Handle could not be slid onto frame because both sides of handle tubing was partially flattened prior to packaging. I had to put ends of handle in a vice to fix. End of pipe that turning handle goes on did not have any teflon tape on it which assembly directions said was required. I had to go to hardware store and buy the tape. One of the tires blew out at 25 pounds pressure from a foot pump. Directions said 30 pounds pressure was the correct amount. Rubber bumpers on front-bottom of frame would not stay attached. I had to remove them and add Washers so they would stay on frame. One wheel bearing had the plastic cover missing leaving bearings exposed.Updated: changed rating from one to two stars. The company provided quick replacement for the tire and tube.
1,Buy this only if you hate your money and want to get rid of it,"I got this thing in. Put it in the drive (Windows 7 64 bit HP laptop). Nothing. It just generates an error about check my system etc etc. In the false product description, these guys lie that it's for XP or Windows NT AND ABOVE. ""And above"" means that pretty much any computer made in the last ten years would use this. This is false advertising and I would not use this to clean the carpet with, it is just an inferior, cheaply-made and falsely-marketed product. Good job on stealing my $2 and 45 cents. I will now go play Crappy-CD-Frisbee with your POS."
1,Out of Date Software,I was unable to use this at all. The software with it was Windows 98 and and I am running Vista. Totally incompatible and I don't know why you would have anything like it in your inventory. Probably won't shop Amazon again.
2,AllsopDriveClean CD-RomLens Cleaner byAllsop,Although I have not used this product.I have used others and felt it really had not done a good job.As I would receive messages that made me think this.
4,"Hard to watch , but need to see","This was a very good movie to watch. many parts in it i would close my eyes or turn my head. but then snap back to see it. telling myself that i need to know whats going on out there. Bc ignoring it. is one of the rezones it got so out of control.Its not all about Dog fighting tho. There are so Very good parts in there that talks about the History of Pitbulls. only thing that worries me about this movie is that some people might buy it for the wrong reason. People who just want to see dogs get hurt. and have no respect for the breed.Im planing on getting me a Blue Pitbull. that i want to name ""Bear"" SoonIm about to donate my mom one of my Kidneys so i have to wait in till im done with that. I would like to adopt one from a shelter. but my mom dose not really like pit bulls. So i think i need to get a puppy first so that she can watch it grow up too see that they are not a bad dog."
5,Great Documentary Describing the Cruelty of Dog Fighting... Very Sad :-(,"I was shown this video at a class while in the Police Academy... It was an eye-opener on how ""big"" is this cruel world of underground dog fighting. These supposedly ""professional dog fighters"" are completely ignorant and lack any sense of morale or compassion. Punishments on these crimes must be more severe. Imposing higher fines would be beneficial since, as you will see in the video, this is what really motivates these people. Money, as well as a sense of power they - someway - lack in their personal life... It also addresses the issue of aggressiveness in pit-bulls and dispels the myth of pit bulls being inherently ""attack-dogs"" very eloquently. The movie is very graphic and emotional... By the end of the day I had decided to get a pit bull."
4,Off the Chain,"I first watched this in my Animal Control training class for animal cruelty. As a long time Pit Bull advocate; it was a look into the mind of a dog fighter. I think it showed some good footage of the people involved and how the animals are treated if they don't win. For the people who claim to love their fighting dogs, they have a wierd way of showing their love when killing their dog for losing. I think the public should be exposed to the realities of animal cruelty and fighting is but one way."
4,gripping,This provided me some insights into the culture of dog fighting and what pit bulls have endured. Not a Disney movie.
5,Eye-opener,"Despite what the 1-star reviewers have to say about this movie without having first watched it, this is an extremely EDUCATIONAL movie! It is pretty cool how both sides of the dog-fighting world are represented. It was interesting to hear from an actual ""dog-fighter"" & how that horrible underground world works. I think everyone should have to watch this movie & THEN maybe something more will be done to end this epidemic that plagues our beautiful Pitbull dogs that we know & love :)"
3,Pitbull,I hate people like that and I wish someone will stop them. Who would want to do that to such a beautifull
5,very informative,This really goes into what REALLY happens to the pit-bull breeds here in america and other places. I bet if more people knew what was happening to this lovable & loyal breed they'd think twice about their witch hunting. It was so horrible seeign the photos and footage of people fighting & abusing these dogs. They even hooked up a losing dogs to jumper cables!! These kinds of people need to be stopped!
1,"Buy this, just not here","I haven't seen this, so I can't properly review it. But since this actually appeals to people with compassion and empathy, I wanted to point out that one can also buy items PROMOTING animal fighting on Amazon. Please don't shop here if you care about animals at all!"
1,Making money from this activity is wrong...,"... including selling this material online.Until Amazon stops distributing dog and cock fighting materials, our family will do business elsewhere and urge friends and business associates to do likewise.It is unsafe to encourage this activity and sends the wrong messages about our culture."
1,BadBiz,"I encourage all of you reading this review to do as I have done and quit buying from Amazon.com. Until Amazon stops selling materials where animals are tortured and killed, responsible citizens will go elsewhere to do their business."
5,"Chapters survey issues of blame, compatibility, criticism and more","Yes, you can live with an idiot - whether it be a spouse, child, or roommate - all depending on willingness to recognize your own 'inner idiot'. Author Hoover is a Ph.D. and the author of the popular How To Work For An Idiot: Clueless Creatures And The People Who Love Them - and he's an organizational behavior consultant who here uses the family structure as his 'organization'. Chapters survey issues of blame, compatibility, criticism and more."
3,Not her best,"This is her 7th album. She once said she was still trying 2 find her style. 1st of all, her voice was completely different from her 1st. WORSE. Not as deep and good as it was B 4. The first song is what U would expect for a teen pop performers 1st album. I liked the violin sound of the 2nd song. But that was it. The 3rd song had good beat and lyrics, but her voice ruined it. The 4th 1 is actually really good. Her voice didn't ruin it. The 5th 1 had a really good opening. The 6th 1 is the best! Great opening, very unique and her voice didn't ruin it. But it was 2 short. The 7th 1 was good, but she wasn't putting enough vocal strength in 2 it. The 8th 1 starts out with a gentle techno sound, but just wasn't good enough. The 9th 1 had terrible lyrics, and was pointless. The 10th 1 was alright. I don't have anthing 2 say about the 11th, and the last song... Uh uh. My over all problem with this CD is that, it was 2 scattered and just not enough. And her voice."
2,She went back,"I don't like this cd, in my opinion, the great progresses she reached with ""Crystal Clear"" was not reached with the latest albums. She's doing more of the same boring songs as in the beginning. I prefer crystal clear because it sounds more modern than this."
5,Searching For Angela Shelton DVD,Great documentary to help women deal with their childhood abuse. You are not alone! Fight for your right to move on and have a productive life.
5,Pyramid PW1286X,"I was a little sceptical at first about this product, I have to say. For the price I was not expecting much. Just a replace speaker for the time being. But what I received was way better then my expectations!!!! I am truly blown away. I give this a 9/10 just because it is a little bigger then a regular 12"" and it did not fit right in my enclosure but other then that performance 10/10. I Even bought another one and is on the way. I will post pictures of them installed soon.PS. I'm running them off a Boss ph.800 1600 watt ampIn a 2003 Honda civic EX 2/Dr"
4,Rommate from hell,"Kate's life is a bit unusual. Her roommate Lilith may (or may not) be an actual demoness. She certainly engages in bizarre rituals. Seeing an opportunity to break out of her rut, Kate talks Lilith into taking her act on the road as a performance art piece.An Opening Act of Unspeakable Evil is a slice-of-life novel in the form of a blog, following nine months of Kate's entries about her experiences with Lilith and on tour. Like many real bloggers who focus on their personal lives, Kate is likable if a bit too earnest, and her story convincingly captures a young person trying to find herself by adding some excitement to her life. Even so, Kate's story on its own could easily have become boring. However, the ""is she or isn't she"" questions floating around Lilith add just enough spice to hold the reader's interest without descending in silliness or fantasy. And in the end, Lilith's growth and self-discovery are the most compelling parts of the novel."
3,Need for larger sizes,Why not expand your selection to include larger sizes??? I'd love to purchas a pair if available in 42.
2,Not bad - the political feminism is a bit much,It was going so well until she had to add her input on how the government should legislate a 2 woman minimum on corporate boards. I'm a true capitalist so to hear someone propose government intervention in todays business climate is quite a turnoff.
3,what a rip-off,I got sucked in! I am a Gram and really thought this was a big set. My grandaughter asked for Littlest Pet Shoppe. I thought Amazon was reputable. I guess I was WRONG! $32.95
2,Some good tips but nothing earth shattering.,"It has been several years since I read this book, but I do remember that I was not incredibly impressed. I was expecting some really strong powerful ideas, but rather remember coming away with a few luke warm tips and ideas. I do believe the book is strongly geared towards helping husbands who are in a traditional job in the corporate world. My husband works in the corporate world but is not in a traditional job so it wasn't to helpful for us anyway. Good luck in your quest to be a SAHM!"
1,"Agree with the concept- male view absent, poorly written...","This book isn't for women that want to help their husbands make more money. This book is written for women who are wishful thinkers.As much as women may not want to hear it- supporting their husband means being an effective and productive household manager. It means being willing to defer gratification ""wants"" in favor not only of more income, but a steadily growing net worth which is the ultimate foundation for financial security. Women (and men) who are a bottomless, insatiable pit of ""need"" for destructive assets like automobiles, which the whole time you're making interest payments on them, are rapidly depreciating will never get ahead with mere ""cheerleading"" which seems to be where the advice begins and ends in this book.Sorry, ladies but telling your husbands daily that they're ""Smart enough, good enough, and doggone it- they're worth it"" isn't a strategy. It's wishful thinking."
1,Waste of my money,"Unless you are looking for a way for your husband to get a new higher paying job or get a pay raise, this book is not for you. I am currently a stay-at-home mom and absolutely love it, but am looking for a way to boost our income a bit. The whole book is about techniques to find your husband a better job or to ask for a raise if he is underpaid. There is one chapter on small jobs for extra income, but that's it."
4,Great Idea...see more,"This is a good book, with ideas we can use. If you want to build on these ideas and have even more money order The Intersection of Joy and Money. I found it a really good resource to help keep more of my money and invest what we were making. easy to understand etc."
1,"Recoil, recoil, and more recoil",I just purchased this nailer on the advice of a dealer. They said they changed the headvalve design to generate more power to compete with that new Bostich tool. I tried the tool at 90 PSI into Timberstrand and the recoil almost caused the top of the tool to hit me in the head! This is by far the worst recoil of any tool I have owned. It also failed to sink the nails flush in the material. Luckily the dealer took the tool back and ordered me a Bostich N88 which he said the salesmen demo'd to him into LVL against all the other framing nailers he had and the Bostitch tool won hands down! I am eagerly awaiting it's arrival to test.
4,The best show on TV!!!,"I love this show. The actors/characters are great along with the writers/directors. I do agree with the others on the packaging. Though I was lucky mine are fine when playing them. I am a little dissapointed on the commentary. I was looking forward to some good talking about the episodes and instead got a bit of that and mostly chit chat. I hope in season 2 they get better and have more than just 4 commmentaries. Overall I love having all the episodes available to watch instead of on vhs. I love the gag reel. I want to thank David, Rob, Cheryl, Nick for making a great show!!!!"
4,Great series but not so great DVDs,"The content of the DVDs is great. The producers are to be congratulated to show mathematicians who are not nerds but interesting, multifaceted people. The episodes are fun and a good mix of mathematics and not-too difficult, accessible mathematics.I give 5 stars for the series but only 3 stars for the quality of the DVDs since the first DVD is not watchable at all and the package is very inferior."
5,Math is cool (even for a novice like me),This is one of the great shows I love. I've never been good at math but this show is so intrigue I'd love to go get some brush up on my math again. Love all the casting and the script is really good. It will keep you wanting more.
5,Numb3rs - The Complete First Season,Great Series - demonstrating that mathamatics is an intergral part of everything we do. Hilights the ability in using this science to solve crimes.
5,It's numb3r one!,"This show is smart, discussing some esoteric mathematical concepts. However it delivers it in an interesting way with metaphors and visuals, allowing the average person to follow along. It gives insights of how mathematics applies to various aspects of life, stressing the importance of math towards understanding life.Despite all the math geekiness Numb3rs, unlike CSI and Law & Order, focuses in on the characters' personalities and relationships. This allows the viewer to emphathize with the characters' lives, rather than being engrossed solely by the case on hand.This combination of developing the characters while they delve into a complicated subject is something I haven't seen before. It separates this show from the rest, and in my humble opinion, it's the best one."
3,Episode 2,Just thought I would comment that (not having seen any of the episodes before) Episode 2 is not the right episode. It looks like it is from much later in the series. It doesn't quite fit the description either.
2,Pilot was 2 Gr0ss 4 m3.,"Well, based on the reviews of this series here, I gave it a try by watching the pilot episode. (Also I found out that Sabrina Lloyd, who I remember from Sliders -- one of my favorite sci-fi shows of all time --was in the show.)Anyway, all I got was a lot of gross images of murdered women in a plot revolving around a serial killer in LA but not a pilot epiode that introduced me to the characters. (The pilot for the Heroes series is my idea of a good pilot episode.)A good pilot episode should develop characters, and by the end of this I felt grossed out but not like I really knew any of the characters in the series. Even Sabrina Lloyd was a disappointment as it seemed that all she did was glower. I read she left after the first season, and if this is all they did with her, I could understand why.Maybe it got better, and I can see why people like this show. The math twist is cool to be sure, but Numb3rs doesn't add up as entertaining for me."
4,Numb3rs The complete first season,I was very pleased with my purchase and the show was as good as I remembered. Will buy more soon. I love the actors in this series and look forward to seeing them in more productions.
4,A good season,"If you like Numb3rs, then you'll like this first season. Including an interesting interview with a Cal-Tech professor who helped with some of the math in the show.Drama-oriented, pretty clean show."
5,Refreshingly Intelligent TV,"I have loved watching Numb3rs, it makes a real refreshing change from the mindlessness of the glut of 'Reality' shows on television these days. Not really knowing the science doesn't mean you can't enjoy the show because ""Charlievision"" makes it all so accessable.It's just a real shame that the australian network doesn't seem to have a commitment to the show I purchased the region 1 set from Amazon because the region 4 DVD release lacked the little extra insights from the cast and creators. Looking forward to Season 3Numb3rs - The Third Season"
5,"thoughtful,entertaining, challenging","I don't watch much television because I don't find it very compelling. I started watching numbers because I'm a high school math teacher and they have great tie-ins to the classroom. I kept watching it because the characters are engaging, the stories are fascinating and the math is great! I really like the family dynamics, I like the interplay between the characters who see the world so differently. I like that each show leaves you thinking.I'm 48 and I love it but so do my 20,17 and 14 year olds. It also doesn't have gratuitous sex or violence. It seems like old fashioned story telling. I would compare it to Monk in terms of good family viewing."
3,Terrible packaging,"This 4 disk set of wonderful shows comes in packaging designed to be seriously damaged. The hard, clear plastic case is brittle, and easily damaged in shipping. The disk case slides out of the overcase on the bottom, almost guaranteeing the case will hit the floor every time it's removed from a shelf. The disks overlap inside the case, rubbing against each other. And the disk case is not designed to close (only fold), so the disks fall out almost automatically.The Amazon vendor I purchased from was very helpful in replacing my damaged disks and case -- but the packaging is a disgrace. Obviously CBS/Paramount took the cheapest option available.Would recommend you purchase in-person, to avoid some of the damage which can occur in shipping."
1,B--o--r--i--n--g,"I really wanted to like NUMB3RS. Unfortunately, it's nothing more than filler on Friday night on a network that never takes risks."
5,NUMB3RS is number one in my book!,"In my opinion, NUMB3RS is the best series on television today. Viewers attracted to its subtle mix of sophisticated academics, homey family values, and high-tension law enforcement drama after the first season owe it to themselves to see it from its pilot and first episode. I'm deaf and require closed captions. I was thrilled to see all bonus feature presented with closed captions as well as the episodes."
2,Great series - bad DVD packaging and quality control,"This series is a great break from the usual cop/detective drama. I was looking forward to it being released on DVD. Unfortunately, the production of this set is sub par quality.1) the packaging is not easy to work with and my copy came with 2 of 4 center hub holders broken - resulting in the DVDs just rattling around inside the case.2) some of the original music that appeared during its original airdate has been changed or dropped altogether. To me, this means I'm not getting the complete first season as it aired.3) on disc 2, the third episode is suppose to be ""Counterfeit Reality"". But what really plays is ""Sabotage"", which is the 2nd episode on this disc. No matter what DVD player I tried and how many times I tried it, ""Sabotage"" always played twice and I haven't found ""Counterfeit Reality"" yet (I haven't completed watching the complete set). In my opinion, this is poor quality control on the part of somebody."
3,First season was ok,"I have only watched the first season of Numb3rs, so I really can't say much about the show overall. Season one is ok, but I was a little bored sometimes. I'm not sure, but maybe there just isn't much chemistry between the characters. Again, I have not seen any other seasons of Numb3rs, so I don't know if the show picked up later on."
5,Numb3rs Season 1,"We needed to review Numb3rs, Season 1, Episode 4, ""Structural Corruption"", to complete some research we had started re superstructure issues in hi-rise buildings. The DVD's we purchased on Amazon are of very good quality . . . enjoyed watching (again) all the episodes available from Numb3rs, Season 1."
3,GOOD VIDEO FOR THE MONEY. NEEDED MORE INFORMATION.,"THIS VIDEO IS GOOD BUT , IS NOT UP TO THE VIDEO STANDARDS THAT WE ARE USE TO TODAY.THEY DO NOT DISCUSS MUCH GOOD INFORMATION FOR THE BEGINNER. ALL IN ALL , A GOOD VIDEO FOR THE MONEY."
3,Great for listening while working out,This is a great way to take your STiletto2 with you when working out.It protects the unit well and the arm band in handy. The only draw back is that it doesn't have a hole in it to reach the power switch so you have to take it out to turn it on or off.
3,It's ok,"Considering the limited selection for stiletto cases, this could be the best, though it is a little loose fitting. It also doesn't have a hole in the side for the power button, which is rather inconvenient."
2,Not designed for the newer Stiletto,"It would have been nice to know that this product was not suited for the newer Stiletto 2. The case while constructed out of a nice soft material, is too big for the Stiletto 2 as the cutout for the wheel does not line-up properly. The biggest complaint is that there is no cutout on the right side of the case (as you look at it) for the on/off slider, so you must remove the unit from the case to turn it on or off.Could have been a really good product , but not worth the $30."
2,unimpressive,"It's a necessary evil if you'd like to not put the big bulky stiletto in your pocket while working out. It works, it's a bit over-priced in my opinion (@ $30)."
1,never worked,"never worked out of box,tech support incompetent and apathetic, paid top dollar at crutchfield for nothing since they are on b.o. and no expected replacement date"
1,Original Recording? It Must be an Original Vinyl Rip to CD,"Dion's Debut album, I thought this would be great to get on a stand alone CD, I have the LP that I never play, this sounds about the same as the old LP, this is awful quality, Mustve been a vinyl to cd transfer, thick and muddy quality, I made the mistake of buying Runaround Sue from Hallmark as well, these are terriblem stay away. I'm going to buy the Ace 2-fer that was put out years back, this is junk, too bad really as this LP deserves its own release."
4,A real how-to,This book is nice that it guides you so you feel like you're in a class with the great Peter Cosentino himself!
3,"good price, but not very durable","I am a professional transcriber. I do not recommend this for anyone who transcribes on more than an occasional basis. Yes, the price is very good, and when I first bought one I was happy with it. But it broke down very quickly. I had to keep unscrewing and opening the bottom of the (very cheap) foot pedal because the pieces inside that were supposed to connect to cause the tape to move would come loose. Also you have to press play and THEN use the foot pedal in order for it to work.It's a very basic machine. For the casual transcriber who may only use it on an occasional basis, it's a good deal. But anyone who uses it more than that, invest the money in a better machine."
5,Great time-saver!,"As a psychology doctoral student I have to transcribe many therapy and interview tapes for various reasons. This machine has dramtically cut the amount of time needed to do that. I was hesitant to spend the money on a transcritption machine as they are not cheap, but I'm glad I did! It was money well spent and I'm having more time on my hands as a result. I highly recommend investing in one of these if you have to transcribe audiotapes."
3,OK but...,"I cannot for the life of me find replacement headphones for this machine. I tried the office supply store from where my company bought this machine and [...]. The machine's fine but, I hate having to use the ""in the ear"" headphone pieces. I'd rather get another headphone like the one that comes with this machine which lays flat over your ear."
4,Panasonic RR-830 Standard Cassette Transcriber/Recorder,"This product is great when working with standard cassette tapes. The only thing I don't appreciate about it, is that it is loud and does not have as many versatile options as a digital transcriber. However, in comparison to what I have worked with in the past for standard cassettes, it is a great little machine!"
1,"Cheap, and you get what you pay for","This is a cheap machine and not for someone who needs hours worth of transcribing. I used it for only a few weeks and it was okay, but the play function malfuntioned after it got a little warm. I had no foot pedal issues as other have described. Bottom line, I don't recommend it."
3,Good beginning machine,"This is a pretty decent beginning transcriber. I don't know how it would hold up for heavy-duty use. The only negative comment I have to make so far is that I feel the description wasn't clear about the variable speed option -- it does not give you a good slow speed option, only faster. I would like something that slows down more than this one does, to save time back-tracking. Other than that, it gets the job done for a decent price. Okay for occasional work."
2,Transcriber,Had some shipping problems with one of the transcribers but the other two arrived from the other companies so I don't know what the problem is. Have heard from the company.
2,Transcriber Hell,Having to plug and unplug your headset for the speaker function to work is a problem.Rememberring to press play before you can use the foot pedeal adds to the steps you need to perform.
1,Dogma sucks,"Maybe the other stuff K Smith wrote was ok, but Dogma really sucks. The characters are boring, the dialogue pretentious, except for the utterly foul-mouthed pair of morons. This must have been directed toward 6 to 14 year olds. The movie was even worse. It's a wonder it didn't sink Damon and Affleck's careers. Even Ed Wood's movies are better than Dogma. K Smith should have left the m & a off the title."
2,Too fragile,It was okay while it worked. Sound quality wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either and microphone quality was decent. The inline volume control and microphone switch were convenient.Unfortunately it didn't last. The main problem was the cord. Despite being rather thick it developed bad connections in many places. The volume control also became scratchy. Finally one of the drivers broke. Because of all these problems I cannot recommend this headset.
1,hard of hearing,"I was very disappointed in the quality of this product. I bought two of these headsets; one as a gift and one for myself. The headphones were ""static-y"" and the microphone didn't pick up sound very well. Also, even with the computer volume turned all the way up, it was difficult to hear.Two thumbs down for this product!"
1,irritating noise,"This set works ok for listening to speech. But when listening to music, it does make an irritating noise for certain frequencies making it completely unusable for that purpose (in fact, it will take some time for you to get rid of the irritation in your ears even after removing this set). I strongly recommend against the purchase of this product. I feel like I made a mistake by purchasing this."
5,These headphones rock!,These headphones are ultra stylish and the volume control feature built into the set is extremely useful. The sound quality is excellent and cranking the volume all the way up is enough to make you go deaf. I always keep the volume half-way cranked up. The microphone also works great as I use it to talk to people halfway around the world on the PC phone. Reviewers complaining about this product probably need to get a better sound card. I have no regrets about purchasing this product.
2,"Cheap construction, poor sound","Pros:InexpensiveVery long cordMic works well enoughCons:Very cheaply madeCord is not single-sided and is thicker than mostNot very comfortableSound quality is poor -- OK for games, not recommended for musicOne of the drivers fell out of its socket, but I was able to take the headset apart and pop it back in."
5,Awsome Headset !,"Unsurpassed headset quality and excellent service from the seller and Amazon. I honestly don't understand the somewhat negative reviews of this product. I have purchased 5 of these headsets since 1998 and everyone of them have/are performing flawlessly. Please note, this product is somewhat rare now so get them while you can. You'll be amazed at the stereo sound and the microphone sensitivity."""
2,Not Autographed!,This item didn't have anything autographed on it whatsoever. Apparently the bar code says it is so no one bothers to check and see for certain. The CD is great of course because Relient K is the best band in existence.
5,More great music with meaning from Relient K,"I just love how this band has changed and matured over the years. They just get better and better. I know a lot of people miss their more goofy days and while I love that music as well this album and MMHMM are just amazing. They have such a beautiful way of singing about Jesus and salvation, as well as the trials and tribulations of life that most of us face. Their lyrics are smart and powerful and the music just rocks, whether acoustic or not. The new songs on this EP pick up where MMHMM left off and the acoustic songs are also tremendous. Also check out their acoustic version of Who I Am Hates Who I've Been from MMHMM which isn't included on this EP. I bought it on itunes (Can I say that here?). Anyway, at this point I'd say God Bless Relient K, but He already has. Looking forward to their Milwaukee show tonight, it should be great."
2,It's a jungle out there,"I ordered this product---the Yamaha PA3B power adapter---from Discount Jungle for $14.95. Unfortunately, I can't review the product because I never received it. What Discount Jungle sent was the Mutec YA3, which is available from another Amazon seller for $9.99.I asked Discount Jungle for a full refund, and I received it. But Discount Jungle claimed to be selling something they weren't actually selling, and I never got my PA3B adapter. Not only that, I had to waste time returning the YA3 adapter to them so that I could get my refund. My time is valuable. So I gave Discount Jungle two stars.Discount Jungle's response to my feedback was this: ""Item shipped was EXACTLY as advertised on the listing. Unfortunately, the customer was not satisfied with the item. Our customer service reps provided him with simple return instructions and a refund was issued. Problem solved.""It's a jungle out there. Let the buyer beware."
4,"Not bad, though the chorus was a little grating..","Listening to my local - and now defunct - neo-disco station one night, nursing a broken heart, this song played. The sweeping synths made me feel like I was flying, and the hopeful, if twangy, chorus told me that love, would in fact, ""Come Again"". I bought the single, and after a few listens, found BT's little twang on the work again (""loove.. cooomes....agin'..."") wore on my nerves. That being said, it has a pounding good beat, is quite danceable, and made me feel a lot better about myself.I bought the version with two mixes on it - the first, which I think is the Original Mix, is the best. The second mix is essentially a sped up version of the first, and seemed like a rendition of heart palpitations..Then again, maybe it's being sped up will hasten love's return. Who can say?"
5,Shower/Shower Powd Island Fresh,This is gooood stuff folks And it feels sooo good on the body----try it you will like it---OH Yes you all
5,shower&shower powder island,i love this powder it smells so nice and it goes on your skin silky really nice anyone looking for a nice fragrance powder buy this you wont be sorry i promise!
3,Closer To Zero Than 100 on the Celsius Scale,"Bychkov seems to have run hot and cold in Paris. Though nice enough, I'd place this closer to zero than 100 on the Celsius scale. There's fine playing and a nicely intimate soundstage, but I've certainly heard more ""life"" in this stuff elsewhere...despite a stirring Farandole and Les Toreadors! Probably right orchestra, wrong guy on the podium."
3,for my hubby,"he bought it to use as a regift ,for christmas ,birthdays,etc. He already has a copy for himself ,he just likes having spares for gifting."
1,A classic among bad movies,"What do you get when you gather together a group of rock musicians - several from the band Spindrift - have them write, direct and star in a spoof of spaghetti westerns, then scratch the film stock and soundtrack so the whole thing looks and sounds like a newly re-discovered B-movie that's been moldering away in some studio vault somewhere? You wind up with ""The Legend of God's Gun,"" a movie so unbelievably amateurish and inept that it makes your own home movies look like models of cinematic artistry in comparison.And the fact that it's ""supposed"" to be bad doesn't make the movie one iota less torturous to sit through. What it does, in fact, do is make one pine for the days when the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" guys would have a rollicking good time mercilessly skewering such an obvious ""Grindhouse"" wannabe - one that plumbs hitherto unattained depths of awfulness in its race to the bottom."
5,An Excellent Reference in the Field,I have benefited greatly from this textbook in terms of both the content and language. I have found answers to questions in this textbook I have not found them elsewhere. The practical examples provided are up to need. It is designed to answer questions raised after an introduction at the beginning of most of the chapters. This textbook is suitable for both beginners and professionals. Understanding the statistical concept behind first is important to understand how the concept works. I realy enjoy reading everytime I read in this textbook.Good Luck to You All
5,Excellent gift for a person you don't like!,"So every year me and a group of people on a message board run a secret santa kind of thing. This year I drew someone I really can't stand. At first I thought about not sending him anything, but it wouldn't really be in the spirit of the game, and I didn't want it to be misconstrued that I was just being cheap or lazy.I don't really know what's inside this book, but the title is perfect. If you hate someone and you have to buy something for them, this is the book to get. I know the book must have been delivered by now but he hasn't even posted in weeks. Hopefully because of this book. I didn't read it but this book has solved my problems and then some."
4,nice Bike but,"The bike seems to be sturdy and made well but it is made in China!!! and there was a part missing but customer service was very nice and sent the part quickly.But the main reason I only give it a 4 is because the bike is huge! I have ridden 26"" bikes and my son is only a little shorter than me so I got this one. I can't even get on the seat it sits so high! My husband had to cut a few inches off the seat tube just so the seat would go all the way down and neither my son nor I can get on it. This runs very large and I am disappointed that it is so large. With the original height of the seat a person would have to be 6 foot tall or more to ride it. I don't understand why schwinn would make the bike so high? My 26"" is not nearly as large as this one and is not any where near as high."
3,The best book I've found.,"Very detailed and informative. Covers everything from wells, water rights, easements, septic, to legal issues in buying. I couldn't have done as well without it. I didn't know what I didn't know."
3,magic realm,"this a game not a book i hope. been looking for it for years. the game is exelent, however every time i get it it is stolen. so it must really be good if they would take it."
1,"BEWARE OF SCAM: This is 1 tape, not 5!","Under ""Technical Details"" it says ""Five tapes"".Under ""Product Details"" it says ""Shipping Weight: 2 pounds""The image also shows 5 tapes.The title says 1-pack but that can be interpreted as ""1-pack of 5 tapes"", right? That's how I read it.However, you will receive only 1 tape, not 5, and it will weight 2 ounces, if that much. I purchased it from a seller that is no longer listed here. The seller promptly responded to my inquiry by issuing a full refund and gifting me the two tapes that I received, asking in return for a 5-star feedback. I think that was a good deal for me.I wonder, though, why this item is still here and the description has not been fixed? Hm-m-m, I smell scam, do you?"
3,Misleading description,"Be aware!! The description is misleading on this page. Amazon put a picture of 5 tapes and described as 5 types 60 minutes each, yet seller is advertising 1 tape only.I contacted the seller and they were very nice to fix the situation, offering me to send more tapes no charge for shipping. Yet still charging for tapes at regular price.Can't comment on the quality of tape yet. Have not use them yet."
2,my hand is XXL but XXXL still didn't fit at thumb web,"I guess my thumb is too far back, or the gloves are not sized right. Either way I couldn't open my thumb due to the tight fit at the webbing at the thumb joint."
5,Can't beat these for the price,They were designed by a orthopedic hand surgeon for chrissakes. But for how they feel on your hands they should cost so much more. I wear these on my hands when I'm riding my Harley. I do have heated hand grips so I can use these gloves when it gets a little chilly. But for cold weather riding I will get warmer gloves.
1,Pompous Ivy League Professor With Little Biblical Knowledge,"Mr. Barr has many opinions for a man with so little knowledge of the Scripture. Here is a brief list of verses that Mr. Barr is ignorant of and contradicts in his book:1) Luke 24:27 has Jesus revealing Himself in the Old Testament2) John 12:47-48 has Jesus saying that His Words will judge at the end of time3) Revelation 21:5 & 22:6 refer to the Bible as ""Faithful and True"" while Revelation 3:14 & 19:11 refer to Jesus' name as ""Faithful & True.""4) Colossians 2:8 says that ""traditions of men"" will conflict with Christ's words. Also Mark 7:3-9 and 1 Peter 1:18-195) Romans 14 focuses on the conscience of the believer.Mr. Barr makes the same mistake as those of the ""Judges Period"" where every man did what was right in his own eyes (self-effort & Babel). You would be better off reading F.F.Bruce's The Canon of Scripture."
2,Fun for 3 hours!,"My 7yo son bought this today with his allowance. On the box it states that the dagger is ""removeable for more play"" but there are no instructions on how to remove the dagger from the glove. I'd pull it but I'm afraid to break it. The glove section of this toy is poorly sewn on and within 3 hours of play it was already coming off. I will have to sew it back on myself. My son said that if he had another $7.00 (at Walmart) he would buy something else instead."
5,Great technical reference,"This edition was published in 1965, and presents between one-half and one-full page of technical data for each type of vacuum tube that was in production at the time. There are tables in the back for tubes that had been discontinued, and this list seems to be comprehensive. There are also many pages of tube theory presented, and circuit examples. Anyone repairing/restoring old electronic equipment should find this manual useful."
4,FEEL LIKE MYSELF AGAIN.,"AFTER MY HYSTERECTOMY I WAS IN MISERY. THIS FORMULA HAS HELPED ME FEEL LIKE MYSELF AGAIN. HOT FLASHES,NIGHT SWEATS AND MOOD SWINGS ARE ALMOST GONE."
2,WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS AUTHOR???,WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS AUTHOR? THIS IS THE SECOND BOOK I HAVE READ BY HER. BOTH BOOKS CONTAINED HORRIBLE PICTURES OF THE VICTIMS. DOES SHE NOT HAVE RESPECT FOR THE VICTIMS OR THEIR FAMILIES? I WILL NEVER WASTE MY HARD EARNED MONEY ON A BOOK BY THIS AUTHOR AGAIN!!!! SHAME ON THE AUTHOR AND SHAME ON THE PUBLISHER!!!!
1,A Farce,"Ms. Springer did no other research on this murder than newspaper articles and court transcripts. Anyone reading these transcripts can see the truth, but choose not to. The story as Ms. Springer has written it, makes for a good sell. The truth will come out about this case eventually, til then, it makes for some good fiction reading."
1,sorry - nothing,"I read a lot of true crime - it's diffult to find stories that are well-written and interesting. This book (). From now on, I will follow Ann Rule's guidelines - only books without a photograph on the cover. This book was horrible. I learned nothing about any of the main characters (Colleen, Christa, etc.)...it was so cut and dry. When I read a true crime story, I want to know everything about the killer and victim, and this gave me nothing. It was just the crime, graphic crime pictures, and the sentences of the murderers. I wanted to throw this book in the garbage."
1,a terrible waste of time and money,"This was about the worse true crime book I've ever read. To me, a good one either delves into the psyche of the killer or the victim, and an excellent one does both. This book does neither. All it does is list a bunch of generic facts that anyone could have come up with, and gory details and pictures for shock effect. The author obviously put no real time, effort, research, knowledge, empathy, or talent into her writing. After reading this book, all I came away with was superficial details, but no hint as to how a young girl can come to commit such a terrible crime, or why."
5,Highly recommended,"This is a heartbreaking account of how teenage jealousy cost one beautiful innocent girl her life. Christa Pike and her boyfriend worshipped Satan and carved pentagrams on the dying Colleen Slemmer. I found this book strong and realistic (frighteningly so) I do warn you that there are pictures of Colleen's body and skull (made me queasy)This book was well-written and I look forward to more by Ms. Springer. Pick it up, you won't regret it."
2,"not a great ""true-crime"" read","For such a horrific, disgusting crime, the book is bland and the author repeats the same information time and time again.Unlike some of the great true crime writers like Anne Rule or Carlton Stowers, the reader does not get to know, or care about the family members of either victim or the killer. The victim, Colleen, remains a mystery-she was 19. I felt like you had no idea why a 19-year old woman would go off in the dark with a group of people wo had tormented her for months.The story is sad and horrible but the book leaves a lot to be desired."
1,worthless!,This book was nothing more than newspaper facts strung together with unnecessary gory details to fill pages (and the author's bank account).
5,BLUES FUTURE!,"Anyone who has seen Rod Piazza & The Mighty Flyers knows that Rick Homstrom was a key star of that band, a very hot guitarist, now he's out with his own band and this is a great first CD! This CD was an expensive production by the Goo Goo Dolls producer and it is certainly the future sound of blues! From the beginning with ""These Roads"" to the end....GREAT! Listen to ""Shake It Part 1 & Pt.2"" and you just feel the energy, the groove is similar to that of the cool Mitsubishi car commercial song, the one with everyone dancing in their car! The music here is different, advanced, a bit techno, but the soulful blues energy is very present! This is great party music, you just want to jump up and dance... or dance in your car! Every song on this album is great! Great band too!!! Buy it....You'll love it! See them on tour too!"
3,Small and good,This battery works fine with your camcorder. Infact only problem you face is that you have to first identify that it will work with your camcorder or not and thats a problem. Its small is size and good as compared to other batteries
1,Semi Nuevo,"There seems to be nothing new is this semi nuevo memoir of a drug dealing cowboy. It may be nice for Don Henry Ford Jr. to share with his family but save your money. It's all been said before,only better."
1,Highly suspect,"The mexican cartels absolutely wouldn't have allowed thisguy living on the border to exist in their territory as itrelates to grass smuggling.In Nuevo Laredo and Laredo,Tx.their have been 170 drug territory related killings year to date.This isn't even close to logical.Further,if his ranching businesswas broke and the bankers were knocking he could not have been anything more than a petty grass-runner.The mexicans have plentyof these types.With no money--you're a mule.This is however goodfiction reading.The mexicans-including ''El Chapo'' of the Gulfcartel would laugh at this one.An individual cowboy on the Mexican border that is broke?C'mon.Mexicans fiercely protect their business.FICTION!Anyone who knows anything about this business knows that this story just ain't happening."
5,Best nail gun in my arsenal...,"I looked at both clipped head and full round head guns before I purchased the Senco 750XL. I use this gun on a daily basis and it has not disappointed me. The Senco literature promises that the 750XL is one of the most powerful guns on the market, therefore like most other skeptics I had to see if this was true. I wanted to see if the gun could drive a 16d nail into a couple of 1-3/4"" LVL beams so I turned the pressure on the compressor to 90 PSI and I set the depth of drive control (nose piece) to the middle position. The first time I hit the LVL with the gun the 16d was set 3/4"" below the surface. I had to back off the nosepiece so the nails were driven flush with the face of the LVL. This gun will indeed drive nails into engineered lumber all day without a whimper or a jamb. My equipment gets USED and I feel this may be one of the best pieces of equipment I have ever purchased. If you asked me to choose between my truck and this gun I'd have to flip a coin."
2,Cold Reception,"I thought I would give this a try mainly because of the price. You really do get what you paid for here. The case is fairly rugged, but the headphones are weak and uncomfortable.My main concern was reception. I would like to use it in my gym where reception isn't great and there are two closed circuti TVs with sound available through radios. Well this thing hardly even worked in my living room let alone the gym.The Koss radio is somewhat better, more comfrotable and slightly better reception. I'm done with the bargin radios. I will splurge on the Sony or Panasonic."
4,Historic Humor,"I would urge anyone interested in contemporary US history to buy this book or any other of the ""MAD About The...."" titles. MAD defined, reflected and revolted an era. There is so much more here than meets the F.B.I. It's fun, moves at a pretty good pace, aids digestion, calms jittery nerves and will shrink hemmorhoids without surgery!"
4,Examining the Vacuum,"Hole in Our Soul brings demanding aesthetic criteria to pop music. Bayles is as critical of mindless nihilism as she is of sentimentality. With sharp historical insight, she tracks the decline of value in popular music and diagnoses its causes in the misappropriation of the African American cultural roots of rock, jazz, soul, and rhythm `n' blues. Her style is very clear, and her argument quite engaging. I especially like her ability to locate pop music in the broader contexts of American history and the philosophy of art. She leaves us wondering where our culture may be headed musically and philosophically, and what it might take to restore quality and value to our art."
2,The Deploring Industry Goes Pop,"This is another of those tsk-tsk surveys of popular culture, intended to prove that the world is going to hell in a handbasketfull of CDs. There's always a market in America for neoconservative scarebooks, but this one is even more smug and thoughtless than the norm. Bayles truly doesn't seem to know the violent, nihilistic stance of pop's folk roots--or perhaps she simply feels that acknowledging this aspect of the tradition would make her Chicken-Little reading of current pop too obviously untenable."
3,How'd they miss GWAR?!?,"I have to admit I haven't read the entire book, but if you love to watch MTV (or TV in general) and clutch your chest like Fred Sanford saying ""It's the BIG ONE Elizabeth!"" then this is the book for you! This book is still pretty interesting; I didn't know about Jamaican DJs as a response to government controlled radio, for example. A glaring omisson is heavy-metal band GWAR (God, What Awful Racket!) They even have a home video titled ""Phallus in Wonderland."" ALLMUSIC has a good article on them."
1,Academic who doesn't know a thing,"Really, really bad. Martha Bayles is no Adorno. There are somelegitmate criticisms to be made regarding popular music, but Baylesisn't making them. In reality she is an apologist for vacant popconstructions like Springsteen (read Meltzer for the real lowdown on him) or even Boys II Men (!) and an incoherent reactionary towards anything that may express true dissatifaction with the status quo (punk, early hip-hop). The worst example of how the hippy ethos has degenerated into the most simple-minded neoconservatism. END"
3,ok but disapointed,stade dvds have been great in past years but this one not as good. too dark and the guys have grease or mud put on them that dont show their bodies as good and the lighting is dark. i think the blk & wht ones were the best ones but again am not very happy with this one.
4,Powder my Cheecks,"The times of seconds of frontal nudity of DIEVX DU STADE DVDs have gone. Let's now call this genre of video ""just-powder-my-cheecks"" or ""balls-covered-by-ball"" videos. Anyhow, I think, good ideas seem to have gone out of the heads of the production team. It all started in 2004 so hopefully fresh and daring; now they seem to be afraid of getting excommunicated. Beautiful photography with bun's galore as usual, but the atmosphere lacks of electricity."
1,WORST,NO ORIGINALITY ON THIS PRODUCTION...ITS A COPYCAT FROM OTHER VIDEO..I LOVE THE 2003 TO 2008 VIDEO..THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
3,MUCH LEFT OUT,"I have been collecting all the DVDs of the ""Making the Calendars"" and I believe the point is to show how the photo shoots are done but I still do not understand what is all the covering penises is all about. The penises of the players are still part of their bodies . I just think they have been castrated with all the covering and genital blank spots.It's silly and in the art of photography is mutilating.It's not pornography or cheap porn if you show all."
3,"Hooray, Amazon - only a few scanning errors!","Miss Read gets 10 Stars but companies that sell flawed books should get 0. I give it 3 only because it is a Miss Read book. I have all of her hardbacks and paperbacks and would really enjoy the ebooks because of the ability to change background colors and font sizes but, after purchasing a few, only to discover huge scanning errors in the others I am giving up. No more Miss Read ebooks. BTW, always demand a refund - it is the only way Amazon gets the message - it doesn't give a damn about reviews."
5,fantastic,i bought this pair of shoes for my daughter for school and she loves it she wants to wear them everywhere it has no laces and goes with pretty much every thing a little girl wants to wear
3,It's pretty good,"I don't own this book but my friend does, and it's wonderful to have all the practice regents. Usually the questions on past regents are very similar to the one you're going to take. The only thing about this book is that the past regents can also be found on the internet site [...]. So you have a lot of the same things on that site, for free. Though the worthwhile thing about the Barron's book is that it has the ""answers explained"" section. So I would probably recommend buying it. I'm taking the Earth Science Regents in four days and I'm pretty confident about it, thanks to my wonderful teacher and the practice I had taking past regents."
3,Not bad,I bought this and a Jay and the Americans cd at the same time. No offense but I prefer the J A cd.
2,Not the singer he used to be!,"The music and the voice bring back memories---of how good he used to be. He has lost that edge that made him so extraordinary and popular. But we all get old, alas, and it's time for him to retire."
4,"Next to ""Best""","Good CD although when I ordered it, I didn't realized it was a rerecording of his music. Was expecting the originals. But I like nonetheless."
3,Not his best,"It's not as well-edited as his other books, it has lots of text with smaller pictures & is more technical & focuses on the parties of his zillionare clients - not really relevant to anything I would do. Some of the theme ideas at the end were fun."
1,not much useable info,"i was quite disappointed. i had hoped for a few things i could incorporate into my own party giving. but i consider it to be a guide to working with a party planner. no recipes, no how tos. for instance the section on music suggest that you ask the DJ for a list of the types of parties he's worked. i'd prefer a list from david of the best jazz cds to serve at brunch."
1,Designer's book is a flop,"Being heavily involved in producing large events, I would have expected a much better book. The ideas offered were mediocre at best. Better you focus on decor ideas by companies such as Avi Adler or Preston Bailey (their work is of better quality) and consult real caterers for food. Both Avi & Preston are much more creative and versatile than anything offered in this book. I can tell you this from first hand experience."
4,detailed and fascinating look at compelling culture group.,"I was inspired to read this book after a 7 day bicycle trip in and around Lancaster, PA. Certainly any cultural group which resists the juggernaut and onslaught of American consumer culture bears study, and this book must be the definitive look at this group. How do you keep people interested in looking different, in downplaying their individuality in favor of the group's needs; in foregoing creature comforts like cars and electricity? And what is even more amazing is that there are many more Amish today than there were 50 years ago; unlike the Shakers, this sect is thriving. I recommend this book highly.RH"
5,The Riddle of Amish Culture,This is a great book. I used it in a reference to my Technology of History class. It is a great product to use to learn abotu the Amish culture and their meanings behind their way of life.
5,good review,ok.. i get it..if you read this you can figure out that you would or would not make a good amish participant.
2,Biased author makes living on writing and lecturing on the Amish.,"It is very important for this particular author to play down or avoid delicate subjects that pertain to the Amish. His own religious background is sympathetic to these oft times not so peaceful people and in order for him to continue to be allowed entry where most outsiders aren't he obviously has to tread gently. It's time for a book on child abuse among the Amish - but not written by their spokesman, Donald Kraybill."
3,More In Depth Look at the Amish,"This is a more in depth look at living Amish through the eyes of its adherants that what's offered in the 11 People's Place books that are priced at $6.95 each. What I don't like is Amish became trendy, for some a life long trend after it sold out with Weird Al's Amish Paradise. The picture from the CD single of Amish Paradise looks like Weird Al lost his humor. Weird Al was hilarious in the 80s, then in the 90s he grew up quick and just wasn't funny any more, taking himself too seriously on Running with Scissors and looking Amish and younger on the poorly planned Poodle Hat. Don't believe what you heard about the Amish in school. The Amish are not a joke, they are not even weird- they are serious people who actually were more content leading a plain lifestyle. Divorce is forbidden in most branches of Amish."
1,The Craft of Prolog,The contents are too confusing and it is definately not for the beginner/intermediate level who want to learn and understand more about prolog.
3,Dissatisfied with case,"The breakdown case was well made with good latches and hinges. The sides and edges are well done too. However, in finishing the case, the person who added the rivets that hold the Velcro straps/metal plates had no idea where to locate the straps. The two straps are practically on top of each other, so it causes the two parts of the shotgun (over/under) to rub against each other. If the straps were spaced far enough apart, it would have helped a great deal.To make the gun case useable, I will have to relocate the metal plate/rivet securing the Velcro straps for more separation, before I can use the gun case for what it was intended. I suppose I got what I paid for, but I am disappointed because Winchester's name is associated with the case and I expected better from them.The other problem I found was, the case had a dent in the edge due to shipping damage. I could have overlooked the dent in the case edge, if the Velcro strap placement had been better withe more separation."
5,The classic translation,Conybeare's is the classic translation of Philostratus' 3rd century Greek work. I look forward with interest to C.P.Jones' updated loeb translation later this year but he will have a hard time rendering the Greek as well as Conybeare who makes an attractive read for non-specialists but sticks faithfully to the original Greek as best he can too.The index at the back of the volumes is also extremely useful and comprehensive.
5,The Miracle Man,"Philostratus' account of the life of Apollonius makes fascinating reading. Here is one of those peripatetic preachers and miracle men that were well know at the time. Long suppressed by the church and vilified as a serious contender to the life of Jesus, the most contentious issue is that some of Apollonius deeds and words have slipped into Christian tradition, and are falsely attributed to Jesus.Never mind Jesus - read up on this fascinating man who was just as much a saviour of mankind as any prophet before and since."
1,Labtec C-110 Deluxe PC Stereo Headset,"If this headset is made like the set I received, then they are absolutely the biggest piece of garbage I have purchased in my life . ""WATCH OUT"" folks , as they don't fit the human head in any Way-Shape -or Form! Now in light of the fact that ""LABTEC"" make some of the ""GREATEST"" sounding headphones around , this particular model should be ""BURNED at the STAKE"" ! I bought the Labtec LT-440 and they are up in the ""Professional Studio Class"" as far as quality in sound bar-non . I don't know the story on the C-110 , but stay away > FAR AWAY ! Buy the Labtec ""LT-440"" and you'll be in heaven especially at under $8.00 a pair ! WOW !!! Pat Simmons"
4,Excellent Chicago Blues!,"Former Muddy Waters guitarist Bob Margolin assembles others from the Muddy Water band such as Pinetop Perkins, Carey Bell, Willie ""Big Eyes"" Smith and Hubert Sumlin and then adds Jimmy Rogers son Jimmy D. Lane and harpist Mookie Brill for a 66 minute recording session. The songs are a mixture of covers of the tunes of Muddy Waters, Jimmy Shines, Robert Nighthawk and Jimmy Rogers combined with original material by various members of the Jam. In true jam fashion, all members step up to take the lead on various songs either vocally or instrumentally. The CD is mainly Chicago blues done in traditional fashion. The 15 songs are varied enough to keep things interesting throughout. Margolin brings a lot of history forward on this disc and certainly gives you your moneys worth."
3,SELECTION AND DESIGN,that book is important becouse that is relatingof the couplings a lot of using in the systems mechanics now.
4,Funny!,"We are currently staging Seth's Anxiety at our school and have shown it to a group of 7th graders and a group of 8th graders. Both found it particularily funny. Our director added a few dance numbers to use the singing and dancing talent she had known she had in some members of our cast. Mrs. Krauhulek, you've done it again. Excellent production! Hug a techie!"
5,very nice,"Arrived on time in good condition. Very entertaining stories. It would be nice if it had closed-caption, but is fine otherwise."
2,"Might as well ships the parts without ""partial;"" install","WOW- One of the worst samples of workmanship we have seen. Instruction sketchy. ""Factory"" assemble looks like it was done by someone with no knowledge. We packed it up and took it to our local bike shop to finnish install and fix factory errors. Bike shop quoted that this was a discount store type bike, if that good."
3,KAWASAKI 26-inch bike,"The quality of the build of the bike is good--better than my last one anyway. Assembly of the bike is however, horrible. The front wheel, with it's linear break was hard to tune, and the break still scrapes on the the break disk. The quick release was missing from the packaging entirely, and I had to go out and buy a new one. The gears took me about 2 hours to figure out, and tune so that there's no scraping on the spikes/leads. Also, don't rely on the instruction booklet, as that is applied to a general variety of bikes, and there are almost no instructions related to this bike. However, once the assembly is done, you have yourself a very god entry level bike."
2,not as good as i thought,This product looks cool and i thought it was fun to ride but when I opened the box there is no manual description. Some of the parts came off and it took me a while to think where it should belong to a bike. A front tire was pain in a neck because there is some kind of rubber filled inside where you are supposed to put a hole with some kind of pointy stuff then you can insert your metal piece that connect the front tire to the front main frame. Hopefully people interpret what I am talking about. Do not throw away any pieces because some will not figure out what to do.went to a website at bikeaid online. it did not help you at all. Very dumb. Come on at least put some simple manual that describe which parts goes to which amazon. Very disappoint and I will never buy a bike from you guys ever again. Very upsetting about this product.
4,excelente producto,"no me imagine la calidad del producto hasta que lo tuve en las manos, excelente bicicleta e cuanto suspensión frenos y todo lo demas. ahora disfruto con mi hijo la experiencia de ir juntos en las hors de passeo"
1,Defective Product and Poor Service,"There was a click in the crankshaft that was loud enough to be heard while riding and felt by the foot through the left pedal every 360 degrees of pedal rotation.I purhased a crank puller tool for $21.44 (incl tax), a crank wrench for $18.18 (incl. tax), and grease for $6.38 to repair this brand new bicycle.Upon disassembly I found two (2) metal shavings, each about 0.25 inches in size, that appeared to be from drilling. I have saved the two (2) metal shavings.I removed the metal shavings, cleaned and re-greased, and the clicking noise and vibration was fixed.Since this was a brand new bicycle, it would seem reasonable to reimburse me for the tools required to repair it. The total cost, not including and labor, is $46.00."
2,Not quite the design shown in the pictures,"The pictures shown are quite deceiving. It is not what you are going to get. I returned the bike I had first received thinking that it was a mistake... but they resent me exactly the same one. I then called the distributor and they said the pictures on Amazon were wrong. I called Amazon and was told they were going to update the pictures. After almost two months, the pictures are still the same (the product was taken offline for a couple of weeks after my complaint but then it came back on with the same pictures). At the end I decided to keep the bike anyway but I was frustrated I didn't quite get what I was originally sold."
1,Lousy Bicycle,"The assembly of the bike is poor. After I got it, i practically had to reassembly it. There were many mistakes in the factory assembly. I took it out for a test drive and the gear shift broke. So assuming you want to buy this I recommend to add 75 dollars to it, because you will have to go to some bicycle store to get a general tune up. I strongly do not recommend this product."
4,Great for what it is,"I bought this bike as a Christmas present for my husband. He is not an avid mountain biker, he just rides every once in a while at the parks around town. He had a really cheap bike (we probably spent $50) from a discount store that he was riding, but it was always breaking. That's why I decided to spend a little more on this one. I also invested $50 to have a professional bike mechanic assemble it for me. My husband has ridden it about 5 times in the past 3 weeks and loves it. He says it's much better than the cheap bike he had. Plus, the colors are cool. Bottom line, it's not for the mountain bike enthusiast. But, for someone that rides a few times a month (or sometimes a year) over fairly easy terrain, it's perfect."
1,Worked well for about a week..,"The bike came mostly assembled, after full assembly I rode it for about a week every day on some average forest trails (rocks, roots, etc.) nothing too hardcore and the bike held up well against abuse. But about all on the same day the bike started to fall apart, front wheel comes loose very easily, front brakes lock regularly. Rear wheel got wobbly for some reason, and worst of all the front fork suspension is stiff and won't absorb any more shock. The chain continues to fall off and the pedals broke almost day 1. This is a walmart quality bike, I didn't get what I thought I was getting. Put in an extra 100 bucks and get something that will last for more than a handful of rides."
2,OK Bike,"This is just OK bike. There is nothing great about it other then really cool design. Seat is extremly uncomfortable, suspension is OK, brakes are OK, Shimano derailleurs are so poor, plastic pedals, etc..."
1,"Not compatible with my phone, but it should have been.","I was able to use it anyway by snipping the wires and splicing them with the old battery's white plug, and then it plugged into the phone just fine, but that's ridiculous. It should have just worked. So one star for cheap price and it does actually work fine now.Minus 4 stars for having to be an electrician to get it to work (even though everything I read said it would fit). My phone? GE 900megahertz model 26938GE1-M"
1,Thief broke the plastic loop,"When I used this product, I worried that the piece being superglued could come off, but when my monitor was stolen the thief attemted to rip the piece off the desk, the piece held on the desk and the plastic piece broke allowing the wire free. Now I am looking for one that is metal."
4,Very Helpful!,"Having purchased the Level One Manual from Hammerman Associates, I was eager to see how Level two would help with my report writing needs. Once again, everything is explained so that it is easy to understand and takes you step by step.I would highly recommend this book after you have purchased their Level One book."
1,Not worth the money,I purchased this in hope I could get some Crystal skills and develop some reports from my accounting system. Instead I got a home-made training manual that goes to a training course I will never attend and that is useless to me.The manual itself rambles on and on and does not even cover the information I found myself just using Crystal and looking in the help file.
5,Great Product!!,This is some of the best sunscreen I've used. Not greasy like some of the other products out there.
2,Downgrade,"I bought one of these because I had a previous model that looked similiar and had the three stage DBB. My two year old player is the best player I've ever heard, so I assumed that this one would do just as well, since it looked similiar and had the same features. However, when I bought this one I plugged in my sony studio monitor headphones, and the sound level was about half that of my two year old player. This was a very big dissapointment. The only way I could get the sound level higher was to use the uncomfortable and low quality in ear headphones that came with the player, which happened to have a defect; the left side was made to fit in the right ear and right side was made to fit in the left ear, so it was even more inconvenient. Philips ought to listen to their older cd players and bring back the good sound quality from years past. Seems like all the portable cd player manufacturers now care only about skip protection and battery life and not sound quality."
4,High Value,"Two of my coworkers are big fans of FitDeck, and recommended it to me. It is great. It makes me sweat without making it boring. I am just getting into it, and I also highly recommend it to people who travel.My suggestion, if you are like me, and a newbie to a rigorous workout, take it one-step at a time. Start with 15 cards in one sitting--and dont push yourself. You will see results quickly."
5,s,"Great, fun idea for beginners to advanced levels of fitness. Pick a card - any card- and do the reps... anytime anyplace. No equipment to buy. Completely portable (comes with a neat little carrying pouch). If you're not quite sure how to do an exercise, then pop in the DVD and watch how it's done. There are even games youcan do as a group. Fun for families - gets everyone involved. Easy movements won't strain or injure. And best of all inexpensive. You won't be able to use it as a clotheshanger like that exercise bike in the corner or that treadmill which takes up half a room but you'll be more likely to use this handy, fun, deck of cards. My weightlifter son and fitness junkie thought this was one of the 'coolest' ideas he'd seen."
5,Great Book!,"This was a really good book. I liked the characters.I really wish they lived in my neighbourhood. I wouldjoin them at the outdoor rink near my house. I'm notnot sure I would be able to keep up with Marcel though, andDanny seems pretty hard to score on, but I would try.The pictures in the book are very nice. They makeyou imagine what the players were going through.This is an exciting book.I can't wait until The Final Game is published.Paul H. Age 7"
4,Healthy,"Great value ... with the multiple dogs in my household who use this, I appreciate getting such a good deal on a good product that helps my dogs move better."
5,Triple strength joint max,I have been giving this this product to our dogs for years. I have 3 labs and 1 golden retriever. The golden retriever is almost 12 years old and has absolutely no joint problems (ever). The Golden has been taking joint max for 7 years now. A 4 year old chocolate lab has had elbow surgery in each elbow and ACL surgery in one back leg and has been on the joint max for 3+ years and is doing fantastic. The almost 2 year old black lab has had elbow surgery and has been taking joint max for 1 year (since we adopted him) and is now doing great. The 4 year old yellow lab has never had any issues and is just starting on it as a precaution. I highly recommend joint max. This seller has had the best price I have seen on this product so far and has very fast service. I recommend them also.
4,Bunny Yeager,"A great title by playmate turned glamour photographer. In this book Bunny Yeager tells the reader how to take glamour pictures, and herself/yourself. A great classis title, by a leading glamour photographer."
3,"good price,kinda","can get a 4 pack of these and see them in person on spencers for a similar price after tax and shipping.. but its still fine. Moves and bends well, came quickly to my house which was nice. But pink was more of a yellow pink,but still cute enough too wear when doin some extra moving. I'm pleased with his buy, and may recommend to friends."
1,C9/Sportline 920 Watch,"This watch continually has problems. The watch apparently locks up if it encounters any static (back panel is part of the HR sensor). Sometimes it totally freezes, other times the buttons just lock but the watch keeps working. Not recommended at all Good idea, but lousy execution. I only paid $25 for mine and it was too much. If I find instructions on how to reset, I'll also post here."
4,Middle Ages England,"This is the second in a series of seven books about Sister Frevisse, a feisty 15th century nun who inhabits the convent of St. Frideswide. Like Brother Cadfael in Ellis Peters' novels, Sister Frevisse not only solves crimes of the body but those of the troubled heart as well. In this story, period details bring the multifaceted world of the 15th century convent to life when the sisters are presented with a troupe of actors who arrive with the wounded husband of the convent's maid. Other Sister Frevisse novels bring the nun into the larger world of the politically connected well-to-do."
4,Great New Band,"THIS CD IS AWESOME, GREAT STYLE AND TALENT, THE SONGS JUST FLOW ONE TO THE NEXT. THIS GROUP IS GOING TO MAKE IT BIG!! IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NEW TO ROCK TO, HERE IT IS. I JUST CANT SEEM TO GET IT OUT OF THE PLAYER. I LOVE IT!!"
2,long delivery - not as promised,"Was delivered after 5 weeks, and not according to what was promised. Only by looking at amazon's-where-is-my-stuff, did I realize that the delivery date had been postponed 5 more weeks. After a written complaint - something finally happened. The condition of the book was ok, as promised."
3,A good summation of Russian history.,"A good summary of Russian history. Both informative and entertaining. I came accross this DVD by accident after an exhausting and disappointing search for a ""Cold War"" history DVD package. My search came up empty under the category...well at least nothing attractive. I recently viewed the first DVD and did not fall asleep. Looking forward to the biography segment in the package. Now on to my review of ""Russia-Land of the Tsars"".PROS:-General overview ""made easy to understand of a complex history"".-Covers major players and events in Russian history.-Good sound track.-Hollywood style theme ""Thriller""-Exciting presentation.-Good narrator.CONS:-Lack of Russian born historians and analysts.-Short on Russian architecture.-No mention of Josef Stalin.-No Cold War coverage.-B movie style renactment scenes.-Price ""should be under $20""As a novice to Russian history...overall this was not a bad purchase. Better if price is under $20."
1,History Channel could have and should have done better.,"Very disappointing documentary!!! Found many many inaccuracies though out. Very one sided in it's view of a very complicated history. I purchased from the History Channel for early delivery before it aired, assuming because it was the History Channel it would be a magnificient piece. Visually pleasing but the producers needed to get Real historians and Real researchers.Save your money!!!"
1,Buy a book,"To put it simply, this show .... . I could barely stand to watch it on TV (maybe it was the speakers, maybe it was the middle school level information), and wouldn't spend a dime to own it. Save your money, and buy a book."
2,Vaguely interesting and nothing new for Romanov buffs,"Alas, yet another attempt at the Hitler Channel for making something not about Nazi Germany! And it failed. Although the score was nice, pretty much everything else was not. They did not interview historians--a lot of these people wrote those stupid ""royal scandal"" books, hardly anything to research about! I was disappointed with the repeat footage and the chapter on the tsar I know most about, Nicholas II, was entirely boring and full of no new information and the rehashed ""he was an idiot, his wife was a hysterical lunatic"" story was told; as for someone who has gone to Stanford University to research the last of the tsars, I was quite annoyed. The other thing that annoyed me was the change of names...Alexis and Alexei: make up your mind (I prefer Alexei)! The whole Cyrillic thing going on to make it more ""Russian"" was obnoxious. Needless to say, I taped over this with something much better, figure skating, and I think I'm glad I did."
1,Poorly set out.,"I bought this book based on the publishers blurb in Amazon.This is an unfortunate demonstration of the major pitfall of buying books from Amazon. If I had looked at the book in a bookstore I would never have purchased it, I sincerely doubt anyone would. The book is poorly executed primarily in its index or rather series of indexes which are set out so to make as little practical sense as possible.I will never be able to tell you what is in the book because it cannot be found. It is a frustrating exercise simply leafing through it because the index is no help. Perhaps if I was intimately acquainted with New England I may have some idea where to look in the book so as I could find what I was after. If I did, why would I be buying a travel guide?I will stick to the DK's Eyewitness Travel guides from now on at least I can find stuff in it."
5,pricey but worthwhile,"My dog was diagnosed three years ago with cholangiohepatitis. The vet recommended Marin and Denosyl. I admit that I'm inconsistent with administering the Denosyl since that one has to be taken in between meals and that makes it hard to remember, but I've been consistent with administering the Marin, which can be taken with meals. Despite the diagnosis, my dog has had good results on his annual check of liver values every year. I can only think that Marin has had something to do with the continued good health of my dog despite the diagnosis of a chronic liver condition."
4,a great keyboard accessory,"I spend a lot of time at a keyboard, and although my hands/wrists have never bothered me very much, I've found that this soft wrist rest makes typing much more comfortable. I recommend this product over any plastic rest. Even if you don't think you'd benefit from something like this, try one out if you get the chance; you might be impressed."
1,It's the best but WARNING,"I love these Gel-eez wrist rests and I own several.But, don't buy them by mail order if they're a chance they will be shipped by air. I have two business trips and one ill-considered... order to support a guess that the gel can degrade in the low-pressure environment during flight. It goes flat. ..."
2,"not too ""gel-eez""","The gel is a little flat, there is a soft plastic crinkly sound when you press your wrists on it and the fabric is a dust magnet. As you can see on the image, there are tabs that stick out on the end which is aesthetically not too pleasing. It is a low budget gel wrist rest and just when I thought I couldn't do better for the price, I did. I recommend shopping around at some computer sites for some other less known brands, like Belkin or Inland which I'm using now (and got for the same price) if you don't want to pay a little more for a Fellowes."
4,jim jones,i think this album was kinda hot this is my first jones cd and im satisfied and just bought on my way to church. i think his flow is good and he is sexy
2,What do I need with This?,"If you are a broadway passer-by, someone who looks to getting to know just what's on broadway and not what's it like, someone who says he's seen all of the broadway shows after reading the ""what's on listings"" in the papers this is a CD for you. I don't own the CD but own all of the Cds from which songs were taken to make this CD. every musical has it's own style and kind of music, and this CD doesn't even take all the highlights. If you are into really experiencing something when listening to a cd, if you are a real broadway-lover and you are interested in modern musical-writing, every one of the original cast recordings (from which songs were taken to this CD-hairpsray, producers, millie, aida, b&b, boheme, moving out) will be a much bigger enjoyment for you than this one. and most preferabely- all of them! :)"
4,This board is wonderful!,"If Jesus had a capture card, it would surely be this one. Maybe not...but still...it's just a wonderful card ($$ and NOT too expensive! $$). It's just great. Although...I've read many complaints about the software having loads of bugs and such...and about how sometimes the audio goes out of sync w/ the video...but I haven't had those problems. I'm completely satisfied w/ the DC10plus. So yeah. If you really would like a good quality capture card at a looooow price (""cheap"" compared to those thousand dollar ones) then go out and get yourself a DC10plus."
1,THE BUGGIEST SOFTWARE EVER WRITTEN!,"We should have been warned off this product with Video Director 200, which we have owned for two years and are constantly battling. But because of price and the fact it is supposed to be perfect for editing home videos, we tried it. What a waste of a whole weekend!The board isn't bad, but the software crashes constantly. The worst instance was when it crashed, and not only corrupted the entire script (2 hours work at least) but all the titles which were saved as separate files (5-6 hours minumum). In 10 seconds most of the weekend was shot, and for no reason.AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE. I wish I could offer a better suggestion but I'm afraid I haven't found one yet. Good luck getting this to work in anything that resembles a consistant matter."
2,not worth the effort for video editing,"I bought this card initially to use as a capture device in conjunction with an older camcorder. I was attracted by the video editing capability as a secondary use, thinking it might be fun. It's true that it is buggy, but if you go to the Pinnacle website, the support area has lots of info on how to work around them. Check it out before you buy! And after you've spent hours getting it to work right, the resulting edited video is never as good quality-wise as the original analog recording. Could be fun for the patient, determined hobbyist with a tight budget, though. If you are serious about video, spend the extra bucks on high end video editing software, or wait for writable DVD cameras. Additionally, the card does not support CUseeMe, only Netmeeting."
4,Excellent buy for those wishing to start and learn video,"This card is great value for the price, just make sure you meet the manufacturer's specifications (pinnaclesys.com). The software is very intuitive/user friendly and extremely easy to use. The only drawback to this card is that it uses and is limited to the proprietary software made by Pinnacle for the editing, and once you become proficient (and you will) at editing with this system, you will want to upgrade to other software and then will run into snags. The output quality is excellent - I have actually produced instructional tapes which I then sold - especially when you consider the cost of the card."
4,The Claw 3 Point Rifle Sling,"I like the design of this sling. Once my arm is properly wrapped into it, it provides good stability of the Mosin Nagant I put it on. It is comfortable on the shoulder with the slip resistant pad on it and it made for a handsome addition to my Mosin Scout Rifle project. All said, it was a good fit for the purposes I had in mind and I am looking forward to putting it to some extensive use!"
5,Excelente product,I bought this box for my niece. She is fascinated by its versatility. She uses to keep her tools for Dentistry school.
2,Cheaper at Walmart,"I needed a tackle box for school and couldn't find one anywhere, so I spent $38.27 on this. Come to find out everybody else found the exact same one at Walmart for $15. The one place I didn't check because a girl who worked at Big 5 said Walmart wouldn't have them. Needless to say, I'm extremely annoyed that I spent more than I had to."
5,The similarity of architecture and art is more important than their differences...?,"Prestel publishes quality books both in terms of construction quality as well as its context. This book is no exception. The question as to when is architecture art and art architecture has been debated since their birht. Instead of providing an answer to this debatable topic, this book provides a compilation of projects that acts as a reference so that the reader can surmise his own. Projects include Christo and Jeanne-Claude's The Gates, Frank Gehry's DG Bank, Eric Owen Moss' The Umbrella, etc. Each project is laid out in either a 2 or 4 page spread with text featuring the designer's background as well as the project description. After reading this book, one has to realize that it is not so important to categorize these projects into absolutes, but rather both/and instead of either/or.amassingdesign.blogspot"
4,Should be read by anyone interested in immune system.,"Good basic discussion about the use of oxygen under pressure. Anyone interested in the immune system and generally keeping high resistance could benefit from this report on a valid study with ""terminally ill"" aids patients. Some of the technical charts and data may not interest the non-doctor reader but adds credibility to the text. The case histories and discussion on infective processes and the relationships they are finding between oxygen tissue content and the bodies mechanisms should be read. Priced very high, so may only attract seriously interested."
4,Abenobashi!,"For all you otaku out there, see this series. It episode after episode of every stereotype and reference to anime/manga/Japanese culture (plus a few others thrown in for good measure) in one show. I highly recoomend this series. There are some who claim it to be an FLCL wanna-be, however, I don't believe that (though Gainax, makers of FLCL, made this as well). For those who want the full effect, there is a two-volume manga of this series as well."
4,A better version of Belle for me,"It may just be me, but since I love the film soundtrack, I find Ms. Brighten's voice as Belle in this London cast recording more agreeable than Susan Egan's which sounds a little heavy. This cast recording is as good as the OBC, I only gave it 4 stars because I prefer Terence Mann's version of the Beast than Alasdair Harvey. I have this recording first which I bought in london, but since I heard the OBC, I think I prefer the OBC, though this cast recording, like others say, was a more accurate recording of the musical."
3,I'm Dissapointed ...,"This is just a compilation of tracks from previous albums by John Darnall. Most of the pieces are from the Night Vision (Ener-Jazz) album. There are a couple each from Slow Dance (Romantic Interludes) and Circular Logic (Ener-Jazz), and one from Under the Stars (Romantic Interludes). Some of these are even shortened versions.Darn ya, Darnall! I do like your music, but there's nothing new here. Otherwise: this is listenable smooth jazz.I've been buying up CD's from the Unison label. They've put out series as mentioned above: Ener-Jazz, Romantic Interludes, Natural Encounters, Jazz Cafe, Contours, Piano Passages, etc. There is quite a mix of jazz and new age kinda stuff. They also put out a number of contemporary Christmas albums. Anyone know of other things from the Unison label?mark.roberts@csus.edu"
2,Not what I expected,"The box is nice, but the sextant arrived broken - one of the screws had fallen out so I had to repair it before giving it away as a gift. The quality of it was not good at all, it looks cheap & there was glue visible in places. It didn't look antique or distressed, just cheap."
4,Some nice hotties,GGW Spring Break 2K2 does not dissapoint. Lots of hot college girls flashing their tops in this video.
3,hmmmm,Im a GGW finatic and 2k2 really disappointed me. 2k1 was wayyy better!!!!!!! Im lookin for people who are sellin thier GGW videos leave me an email. Stay up and write reviews so i kno which to buy. lata
4,Inside the Fence: A Primer for Prison Ministry,"This book, subtitled, ""A Handbook for Those in PrisonMinistry"", lives up to it's name. The author intends this bookto be a starter for further study and discussion into what a chaplain's role is in the corrections system. The book offers a look inside the prison fence. Chaplain Schilder suggests a number of ways in which Chaplains, Administrators, and lay ministers can prepare themselves for this very unique and specialized ministry.Although a Roman Catholic himself, Chaplain Schilder recognizes the church community within the arena of the prison. He is an advocate for ministering to the whole prison regardless of sect or faith.David Schilder has spent over eighteen years as a Chaplain, in Honor Camps, and in Minister-in-Context programs. He is well qualified to guide the reader ""Inside the Fence"". END"
1,Poor in every way,"The helpful guy at Bed Bath & Beyond told me this was the best coffee maker on the market. He must be getting kickbacks or something. The first one I bought didn't work and the company helpfully replaced it at no cost. But the truth is it never worked all that well: the coffee isn't hot enough and the machine is poorly designed--try to clean the place you pour the water into and you'll see what I mean. Finally, after owning it for a year, it has started breaking down. I highly recommend you avoid this coffee maker."
2,updated review...,"This is an update on my first review. I originally felt that this machine wasn't much better than a $40 coffee maker. The coffee temperature is good for only the first or second cup. Other than that- the coffee tastes good and the features worked well for a while. I have had this for just under two years and it is now leaking water out the bottom. I can no longer pre-fill it at night or else the water is all over the counter in the morning. Even with filling it immediately before brewing will result in some leakage. The KithenAid name has always made me think of quality, but this being my first product from KitchenAid has made me rethink my views."
1,Mmmmmmm......I love my lukewarm coffee from KithcenAid,"I have had this coffee maker for a few years. Since day 1 the coffee does not even get close to hot, especially if you put any creamer in it. You have to put your coffee in the microwave to get it hot, then it loses a lot of its flavor.I have tried heating the carafe first, using warm water, etc. The water comes out of the shower at only 150F. This is about 50F short of proper brewing temperature.The best coffee I have made from it recently was when I just used it as a manual drip. I boiled some water up, removed it from the heat for a few seconds, then poured it strait onto the grounds. This is the only way to get a good cup of coffee from this coffee maker. My wife, not knowing how I had made that pot commented, ""Hey, did you fix the coffee maker?"" ""Not exactly"" I replied.Save your money and get something that will brew at the correct temperature or just get a manual drip cone.Brian."
2,"Looks good, coffee not hot or flavorful","Coffee not as hot as even I'd like. And I like to have it tempered enough to drink right away. Like others have said, you need to put it in the microwave to make it warm. I ignored these reviews thinking they were from people that needed it scalding hot. NOT SO!!! I believe flavor is limited in this maker too... And probably from the lack of heat in the water."
4,java studio,"To call this item a 'studio' is to engage in overstatement. It just brews coffee. It does brew coffee fairly well, however. The only drawback I've found in a month or so is that Kitchenaid's definition of 10 cups is more like my six-and-a-half."
2,Needs replacement after 2 ;years,"I got his coffee maker 2 years ago, and it needs replacement because of the leakage from the bottom problem that others have reported. Also, the coffee never got very hot, even when new. My husband always complained that the coffee didn't start hot and was cold in his travel mug before he got to work. Certainly, the steel carafe reduced the temperature, which should require the maker to brew hotter coffee in the first place; but it does not.It looks good, the clock and programming keys function reliably, and the grounds and water were easy to fill for brewing.I'm looking for a different brand and model."
4,Discontinued coffee maker,This coffee maker is a good coffee make but Kitchenaid no longer makes this coffee maker. They havent for 3 years. I call Kitchenaid about the set buttons and they asked the ser.# and they said they stopped making the thermo-craft coffee maker a long time ago. I guess some stores have old stock. Any way kitchenaid sent a new coffee maker no charge but not the thermo-craft. That was the reason I bought it.
4,On a budget? Think about these.,"These are no $250 headphones; in fact, they're not even $50 headphones. They don't have fancy Sennheiser foils, or Neodymium magnets. And they are a little bit colored. But that said, they're nice, they're closed, they're comfortable, and they've got 30mm drivers. Bass notes come out as clear tones, not indistinct rumbling or horrible vibrating plastic. They fit on my head nicely, and the cord is more than long enough. If you're looking for something better than those crappy headphones that came with your portable player, but you don't have a lot to spend, give these a try."
3,acceptable sound in a comfortable headset,"These headphone, though by no means audiophile grade, are overall a good buy. Comfortwise, these automatically contour ergonomically to even the largest of noggins. They gently press against your ear with plush, cool padding; unlike many headphones, I can wear these for hours without a hint of pain. In this respect they're superior to $100 studio reference headphones I've used! Soundwise, they are merely what you'd expect for the money, though they do mute loud music quite well - handy for the public computer labs and road trips! If you're going to use headphones on a really regular basis, I'd recommend spending a bit more, but they're fine for casual listeners and great for the money."
3,Good to see one time,"It was an OK movie, worth watching at least one timeGreat concept, good acting, but not the greatest special affect."
3,a better than I thought cult comedy,"Not sure why this film took 14 yrs to be released on DVD but better late then never. It's an interesting insight into the early life of the wingnut films empire, not sure what happened to Tony Hiles but I for one like the film. It's not a laugh a minute or a non stop romp but definitely worth a watch all the same. Some good odd ball characters and one liners, ""I want to sleep with you Eileen"" is a classic."
3,Well made for buns of steel,"This seat was well made and was simple enough to install; however, we found the design to be, well, painful. Neither the son (small), wife (tiny), nor i (big) found it comfortable."
3,Good Unit While It Lasted,"I had this personal cassette player for little over a year. Unfortunately, after dropping it the headphone connection shorts (even though I bought new earbuds). While it lasted, the sound was good and no problems with the functions. Wish they could have developed a player that could withstand shocks. (Forget Walkman Shock players, more $$ and they're junk.) Looks like cassette players are passe. Too bad, because I listen to books-on-tape."
3,Rides nice/ Needs a proper setup though.,"I put the bike together according to the horrible instructions, and fenders rubbed against tires, and brakes inapproriately rubbed wheels at the wrong contact points. I ended up taking this bike to my local bike store, and for $60, they took it apart, greased every nut, screw, and bolt, and corrected the fact that the Chinese manufacturer assembled the partially assembled bike incorrectly (fenders backwards, etc.).Now that the bike is set up properly, I like it very much. Spend the money and get it assembled and set up right from the getgo, and avoid the frustration."
5,AWESOME,"So I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He's a huge fan of Maynard James Keenan, who uses this exact same wine opener in the movie ""Blood Into Wine."" I was thinking it was gonna be cheaply made when I ordered it based on the price, but it's of really good quality and works well."
3,Pretty...,"I thought this ring was very pretty from the pictures, but the detailing was a little different when I received it. It's much too new looking to be ""antique"" and I really wasn't too fond of the line designs in the ring -- more ""old-world"" looking in the picture. The diamonds are of a nice quality and overall it's a well-made ring (although it doesn't have a lot of weight to it). I would classify it more in the art-deco era."
5,"Simple, but straight to the point.","Very Simple but to the point. It sets a firm goal for the players who wan't to improve their shooting, but don't know what to do other than just simply continuously shooting the hoop."
3,Was expecting more,"My 10 year old daughter and 9 year old nephew were not interested in this video enough to watch more than 5 minutes. Another video I had bought had them actually trying the things shown and excited about learning. I gave it 3 stars because you can go on-line for more information and coaching tips, etc. -- Don't misunderstand. I learned from the techique shown, but the kids didn't think it showed them anything they didn't already know. I think I could have better spent that $[...]."
2,"Just try to find ""Salade De Fruits"" online somewhere","First off -- I would never had purchased this product if it was $45 -- not sure why it's so expensive but it wasn't when I picked it up.Bought it solely for ""Salade De Fruits"" which is delightfully infectious and playfully sung. I heard it in a French class in college a million years ago and sung it to my kids when they were infants. The collection was a gamble -- I thought there would be other gems ready to be unearthed. But maybe since I'm not French, none of the other tunes are endowed with the universal hooks of ""Salade De Fruits"" and they sound goofy and too ethnic (in a bad way) for my American ears. Bourvil is like the French Raffi of a bygone post-WWII era."
1,Cuckoo's review,"I had to read this book for school and am having trouble getting very far ebcuase it is nto interesting, it is about psych patients and stuf"
1,beginers minidisc,the reason for my choise of this player in the begining is it was a present this player is not the most easy to use in the world because the only way to control it is with the remote. the cord is very long and can tend to be more of a problem than it is worth. i have also found that the batteie life is absolutly no good. i belive even if you are a beginer minidisc user most people need longer than 5 hour playback time
2,"great price, looks good, sounds good, but....","when i first opened up the box and listened to it, I thought it sounded great. I liked the remote thing and everything else. I then noticed that it wouldn't play half the tracks on my minidisks... they play just fine with my other player. So i returned this product. As far as minidisks go, Casio does not seem to be one of the major players and i believe i know why now. Maybe it was just mine but i returned it in a matter of an hour of recieving it..."
3,Simplistic,"This book is essentially a rewrite of Tony Buzan's books on mind mapping. If you're interested in mindmapping techniques, read Buza."
5,Simply The Best!!!!,"This is by far the best Wings cd produed. Even better than the latest out. Get this one, and be blessed by a guest performance by Dottie Peoples.Thsi is THE Wings cd to buy and it's at a sweet deal of a price used!!!"
5,When I say Dreyfus---You say Smith!!! Wings in the House!!!!,"Rev. Dreyfus Smith is one dynamic singer and as well as pastor. Kudos goes to Rev. Dreyfus C. Smith and the entire Wings of Faith Mass Choir. This is only the beginning. And if you thought this CD was da bomb, stay tuned for the next one. Get Ready--Get Ready--Get Ready!!!!"
5,POWERFUL PERFORMANCE BY ENTIRE CHOIR,"THE SONGS WAS BOTH POWERFUL AND SPIRIT FILL. FROM BEGIN TO END, REV. SMITH AND HIS CHOIR SHOW OUTSTANDING ABILITY TO KEEP YOU ATTUNE TO THE WORDS AS WELL AS THE BEAT."
5,A Must For Hank Fans,"I am so glad to have this in my collection. It is worth owning just for the original performance of ""Lovesick Blues"" at the Opry, the moment that catapulted the King of Country into the stratosphere and elicited six encores at the time. Some of the comedy is corny for today but it is still a great time capsule of what the Grand Ole Opry was like for listeners all across the country before the birth of rock 'n roll. This is a must have for any fan of Hank Williams."
2,Another sham by Mercury & Kira Florita,"Somebody fire Kira Florita! I mean, give me a break. The music is wonderful, but the packaging is shoddy! Disc one is great, but runs short of even 60 minutes. Disc two is an ultimate letdown and disgrace running at only barely over 25 minutes & only including two songs by Hank. Come on, Kira, you could have either put those two on disc one (and saved me some money) or added more live Hank material to disc two. There are plenty of other songs that could have been added such as alternate live takes of Cold, Cold Heart or Dear John. How about the cut with Anita Carter on I Can't Help It. Mercury tells us what a horrible job MGM done with Hank's material, but I say Mercury is doing even worse. Someone please talk Bear Family into doing a truly good set of Hank's live material!"
5,Hank live at the Opry,"This 2 CD set of transcriptions recorded live at the Grand Ole Opry is a must have for all country music collectors as it not only is a reissue of an LP issued in the 1970's, but is a 2 CD set with not only performances by Hank but also Minnie Pearl, Rod Brasfield, Red Foley, Oak Ridge Quartet and other Opry regulars at the time Hank appeared on the show. The 2nd disc does contain an entire show from 1950 while the first disc does have Hank performances from 1949 (his debut on the Opry to 1952). The packaging is a nice hardcover book with pages of nice liner notes and rare photos. I'll repeat this but this isn't only for Hank fans, but for all country music collectors no matter how big a Hank fan you are as the humor is a major part of the Opry."
4,future_clash players!,"electroclash combined with EBM, doing a style named ""future_clash"". with vocals by the electro diva Jennifer Parkin of AYRIA and sounding like fresh nu-electro. includes great club remixes. for fans of Ladytron, Fisherspooner, Miss Kittin, Goldfrapp, Farilight Children. EP with 8 tracks. featuring the Club Hit ""Senses"" plus Geometry and the exclusive Recycled in 2 forms."
1,Low Quality Battery,"Used these batteries on my clock.After only a few months,the battery began to leak,destroying my five year old clock.If you want to use batteries for clocks,never ever use Energizer"
3,Not great but not terrible,"So, I'm still grieving the loss of Bali brand all-over lace body slimmer, which was discontinued, and in my quest to replace it I tried this. Not great but not terrible.Some positive points are that it is really light weight and still seems sturdy. It has firm control but was not tricky to get on. I am tall-ish 5'9"" and the rise seems long enough for my body type which is a relief.Some negative points are, the ACTUAL points that this bra gives one. Umm. I have never had a more awkward cup on a bra in my life. I know its a minimizer but it is seriously misshapen. The only way to describe it is that when I look down, it looks like squared off box. I almost returned it but then decided the plus out-weighed the negatives.It also has a non-elasticized shoulder strap, which I have never had on a bra or shaper, and I actually like it a lot. It's soft and does not dig.Maybe if you are smaller in the cup this shaper won't look so weird. Not sure..."
2,Very slow pacing,"It's obvious from the reviews that this show appeals to a lot of folks but I found it to be unbearably slow. Too many long, redundant shots, too little dialogue and action. Acting is fine."
4,An Unusual Journey from the BBC,"Eleven years after U.N.C.L.E., two years after THE NEW AVENGERS, David McCallum and Joanna Lumley join forces as ""Elements"" sent out to keep ""Time"" -- a living lethal force -- from breaking into our world. As with a lot of BBC scifi from that time, the effects can be a bit cheesey. Sometimes the storylines are dragged out over an interminable number of episodes but in the end, interesting and a good addition to any collection. If you like tales of travelers in time, haunted locales and mysterious vanishings, enjoy!"
4,Sci Fi before the big money special effects,Joanna Lumley and David McCallum at their best. Subtle performances with the slightest bit of tongue in cheek humour. It's a shame the series didn't go on longer. Perhaps we could have met more of the elements. Servere over acting by most of the other cast in each of the cases but still very enjoyable and ahead of their time in special effects.
5,Great Science Fiction!,"This complex Bristish series demonstrates what can be done on a low budget with great writing and excellent actors. The lovely Joanna Lumley and devastatingly handsome David McCallum have great chemistry as Sapphire and Steel. The adventures take a while to get through, but it is well worth the effort. My only caveat would be--don't watch the last adventure alone!"
5,Sapphire and Steel,"Great return of this off beat Sci-Fi British program on DVD, following the tradition of the classic Dr. Who series."
3,Unusual British sci-fi,"This British series ran on the independent network, rather intermittently, in 1979-81. While the episodes lasted 30 minutes, there were long story arcs, so that in effect the series consisted of six full-length TV movies. Although billed as science fiction, it often had more in common with ghost stories. The budgets were very limited. Hence the events always played out against very sparse stage sets, and the drama was mainly in the dialogue. This gave many of the episodes a claustrophobic ambience - one was filmed largely in an abandoned railway station, another in a seemingly haunted house. The plot lines were bizarre and fanciful, low on plausibility, and generally very slow moving. Arguably, the best episode was the fifth, which brought in more characters and resembled an Agatha Christie mystery from the 1930s. While there were some intriguing ideas, the worst aspect of this series was that the stories tended to run much longer than the plots would justify."
5,The Crow,I love the Crow.....It is the greatest movie of all time and this book lets you know even more about what really went on during the making of it. You must check it out!
5,Better than expected,"I bought this book because I'm a big Crow (the first movie) fan. And since it not easy to get some real info on this movie where I live, this book gave me a really good look at the movie and the tragical accident of Brandon Lee. After all these years there were questions playing in my head, but by reading this book, most got answered. I really recommend this book to all people who want to know more about this film..."
2,Dissippointed ....A Save the Abalone Disguised as a Murder Mystery,"This is a book I wouldn't buy again. I felt like it put the value of a shell fish over the value of human life. I understand that a author has a right to write whatever is important to them...just as I can and will choose not to buy from certain authors. I bought it in Kindle form, and there was a blurb somewhere about plague at the campground where the murders took place, well that was never fleshed out in the story. It was just a teaser. I don't plan to buy anything by this author again."
5,Shell Games,"Climbing a suspenseful ladder, Marquez leads readers on a journey, taking on with passion and some assistance, the ongoing California poaching problem. This book brings real environmental issues to the center stage. Kirk Russell 's story stays foccused, and close to the heart. Or at least to us Californians, concerned with what our children with be left with or without, tomorrow.Marquez is constantly trying to keep a balance, and readers will begin to feel his emotions, and embrace his goals as their ownHats off to Russell, for taking on social and environmentalconcerns that has gone unnoticed , or misrepresented to the majority of us. It's very refreshing to find someone like Marquez! Looking forward to the next book....."
2,don't bother,"I was a bit disappointed in this book, and certainly can't recommend it for others. The plot was confused, and the reader could easily get lost in knowing who was who."
4,Relevant and engaging...a great first work,"As a diver, NorCal native and committed conservationist, I was captivated from the start by this potent, believable tale. Russell's characters are completely real, coping with difficult work, complicated families, career decisions--hey, a lot like the rest of us! His eye for subtle details and capacity to project the plight of the characters onto the canvas of California's fragile resources make the story at once relevant and engaging. This is a promising first effort, and I can't wait to devour the next in the series."
2,kind of disappointed,well i just received the package today from England and it came sooner than expected. the book that came is in good shape and its A Treasury Of Hans Christian Anderson alright but its not the International Collectors Library edition. i was kinda disappointed cause i wanted THAT edition but well i guess i cant complain really cause i paid 2 cents for it. at least i got a book.
1,this is a 2004 Christmas Doll,"Although you cant see it in the Picture and it is NOT stated in the desription this doll is a 2004 Christmas Doll and Says 2004 on her Dress.My daughter loves Manhattan Toy Dolls...... but if you were planning on giving this as a gift, you may want to reconsider."
3,fell apart!,fell apart! the vinyl boot ripped almost immediately. I took too long to do anything about it and I'm stuck with it now. grrrr
2,Drop the Days of the Week,I guess I'm being picky. Okay I know Sunday is really the first day of the week but for those of us tracking miles by week (especially important for building your bases so you don't over do it) you usually can't break the weekend apart. Sometimes due to your time schedule you can train long on Saturday and sometimes you have to do it on Sunday. Let's say your building for a marathon. You do 5 - five milers during the week and a 15 mile run on Sunday. Next week you do the same but have to do the 15 on Saturday. According to the book you did 25 miles one week and 55 miles the next. How's that for tracking weekly miles? The better training log's leave the days of the week blank so you can fill it in. And yes I know you could always cross out the days of the week in this log and rewrite it but why should you have to?
5,Spiral Bound,"One of the main reasons I like this diary so much is that it is spiral bound. You can't tell from the Amazon photo. So I keep it open to the week I'm running in to make entries quick.I have been keeping track of my runs for 5 years with these diaries - they have enough room in them for one year of dates and comments. The comments area for each day gives you enough room for a few sentences.For me, a casual runner/10K'er who does about 500 miles a year, I feel that keeping a diary has kept me going. It is alarming to see that I already can't go as fast as I used to, but I've run a total of more miles each year. The used/resold versions are only a few bucks."
4,Solid As A Rock,"The training diary is solid because the format has not drastically changed over the years. The log has ample space to chronicle your feelings/outlooks/goals and you fill in the dates, so a person does not have to ""start"" on January 1 to use the entire book in a year.Also, those who don't run, but need a book for swimming, cycling, etc., will find it a practical investment compared with other available sport-specific diaries. This is a great investment to chronicle the road traveled...and the miles ahead."
2,Not for Sonicare toothbrushes,"If you have the Philip's Sonicare brand electric toothbrush, don't buy this unit, they do not fit in slots.I had to return mine, and am out shipping, handling, & return shipping charges. Just an FYI, if your electric brush head is any bigger than a standard size toothbrush, (diameter) don't buy it either, it won't fit. They do have a model ESA302 that works with the Sonicare, but it is alot larger."
5,In search for the Great Hall,"Yep, first there was ""Reefer Madness"" (1936) telling of the pitfalls of smoking reefers. Now there is Mazes and Monsters madness. An undetectable force that you are powerless to resist.Tom Hanks as usual fits comfortably in any role he plays. The theme may be a little dated, but it is still fun to watch and speculate ""There but for fortune go I"".As you have guest the story is about a role-playing game that gets out of hand. Tom Hanks plays a person that might not be quite stable and the addition of this game feeds his fantasies. This leads to a mysterious disappearance. This is more of a physiological movie than a blood and guts type. Before people say what is real or not, different people will come to this movie from different backgrounds, and go away a little closer.""And so we played the game again for one last time. It did not matter that there were no maps or dice or monsters... We saw nothing but the loss of hope and the death or our friend.""Man With One Red Shoe"
5,One of Daryl's Best,"For those of you who do not have this album....This is one of Daryl's best. His vocal skills can not be matched by any other male Gospel artist. This album is truly a blessing. The songs I enjoy on this album are ""He's God"" (funky tune with brash guitar riffs), ""Heal the Land"" (By far my favorite), ""Oh the Lamb"" (will have you raising your hands anywhere), and ""Work It Out"". The rest of the material is nice also, I just enjoy these songs more. If you don't have this album, you're missing out on a treat. This is a truly wonderful project and I am not a big Daryl Coley fan. I am a huge fan of his vocal ability, but his albums except for a few songs (the popular ones) never did anything for me until this one. I was never really pushed to buy one of his albums until this one released. Finally, anytime an artist works with Kevin Bond you know his/her project will be tight. (i.e.-Donnie McClurkin, T.D. Jakes, Donald Lawrence) Any of those names sound familiar?"
3,3.5 Stars,"GREAT MUSIC. Haystak really steps up his lyricism on this album (I guess he's trying to show Def Jam that they shouldn't have dropped him), and he shows growth as an artist also. The production on this album lacks at times, but overall it's a MUST HAVE."
4,"Okay, Four and a HALF Stars","It doesn't look like there's heavy traffic here to see this compilation by The Sad Poet. The Amazon info is dated also for Don Gibson was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001, two years before he passed away in Nashville. This is a pretty good package of Big Don's music, some really solid hits. Don had a roller coaster career what with drug and alcohol problems but he left us with some fine music much of which is in this compilation. Too bad it doesn't include his later (1972) country hit, ""Woman, Sensuous Woman"" but that could have been for another label. This one is worth the price and I recommend it."
5,Great Originals from RCA,"This is one of the great country singers of all time. These are the original RCA recordings. Watch out for the ones that were re-recorded under another label. They don't sound as good as the original RCA recordings, and, in my opinion, shouldn't be sold without a disclaimer.These songs were originally produced by Chet Atkins, and you will hear his unmistakably great sounding guitar on many of the recordings. Floyd Cramer also provides accompaniment on the piano and Charlie McCoy on the harmonica.I don't know of any singers today who can compare with the likes of Don Gibson, Connie Smith, and David Houston. Do yourself a favor and buy this album. You will have countless hours of listening pleasure."
5,Great,This seller was great to do business with. They shipped the book in the alloted time and I got what I paid for.
3,Good for basics not so hot for advanced tips.,"Well, I was looking for something with advanced tips on LotusScript, merge, etc. This was not what I found. However, I did find a lot of basic information and I learned a few things about the applications that I don't use very often. This book has saved me quite a bit of time and taught me a few interesting things. It is no reference manual however."
5,One of a Kind,"I love this book. I wish there were more like it - backpacking-specific recommendations. There are so many hiking books, but this is the only one of its kind I've found for PA. Suggestions for all ability levels in all parts of the state with many different hiking styles from weekend trip to month-long trek. I refer to it often."
4,"good guide, but more research is needed","I used this book to guide me through my first 2-day hiking trail in PA. It was useful for the fact that I do't know much about Pennsylvania trails. It gives you a breakdown of the whole state, telling you everything about what you see on each trail down to the kind of plantlife you can expect to see. There's also helpful ratings about each trail so you can pick one that is suitable for your level of experience. Each description of the trails also have a rough sketch of what the trail is like...marking campgrounds and bodies of water. However, the trail description on the one that I chose said that there would be a park office where we could get a topographic map of the park. I might have missed it, but we never encountered such an office. I highly recommend just using this as a guide and buying your own topographic map on your destination.Other than that, I am planning to buy his guides on some other states. It was very helpful."
3,Just Okay,"This is a good product for a second or third VCR unit. I didn't care for the remote control. The push button function on the remote is to small. In addition, the push button feature has to many function (play, FF, Rewind, Stop,pause). It is very awkward to use for adults hands. Overall it's a good unit."
3,A romance novel dealing with a tough subject...,"Jane Orcutt opens her novel with a harsh look at reality...a husband and young child being killed by a drunk driver while the wife/mother watches from across the road. The story of Leah begins here.We watch her life unfold as she goes from grief and anguish to rage and anger. She becomes in her own words ""a living stone"". She cuts herself and her emotions off completely. Her parents want to rule her life and no one wants to talk about all she's been through...no one until she meets Jacobo, the drunk driver's brother-in-law. It is through her friendship and subsequent relationship with him that Leah comes back to the land of the living.It is predominantly a story about forgiveness. Ms. Orcutt handles the storyline very well and her characters truly come to life. It is a lesson in letting go, forgiving, and moving on."
4,Good ol fashioned Thrash,"If you are looking at this DVD, chances are you know who Tankard is. If you do not, and you like thrash metal, you should find out who they are real quick. They are awesome.This DVD is two concerts in one. One from earlier years and one from more recent. You can see that the band has changed a bit, but they still rock.I would recommend this to anyone who likes thrash metal. I would have like to see a better menu system, (smoother, I should say) but that didn't stop me from banging my head to this awesome DVD.Must have for any thrasher's collection!"
5,"Ahhhhh, the eased up wrist...","I'm a programmer so I'm on the computer 10+ hours a day. This pad has been a god-sent for me. My wrist is relaxed throughout the day while resting on the goey gel pad inside the pouch. You can even chill the gel pad in the fridge during the summer! I used a coupon from UnderTag.com, so it was almost free for me too."
1,Gel-eez not the best choice,"We bought 3 of the Case Logic Gel-eez wrist supports several years ago. My wife used them for a short time, but we both found that one's wrist is elevated too much for it to be comfortable and/or useful when grasping the mouse. Modern mice have a low profile, so a simple 1/4 inch thick foam pad would be much more enjoyable and useful. Initially the contents were a gel, but after a few years, all 3 of the supports, which were stored in a drawer since we didn't want to use them, had their gels turn to a liquid with a viscosity similar to that of water. I would be worried about using a liquid-filled device near expensive computer equipment or other valuable things. It is time to throw them out and learn from our experience."
3,Fun n' fluffy read from the purveyor of all things francais!,"I can't get enough of Peter Mayle, & that includes this breezy, pond-hopping mystery with a twist of urbane humor. I would have preferred another narrator/reader. I like Ken Howard (something of a dish, wouldn't you say?) but he leaves something to be desired in his rather wooden presentation of ""CEZANNE."" Nice to have a non-white love interest in a story like this though...refreshing!"
3,Disappointing after earlier books,"This did not measure up to Mayle's earlier novels. The chase & the locale were interesting, but Andre in particular was not a great character. It was fairly predictable and not as well written as some of Mayle's earlier adventures."
2,Lightweight Divertissement,"This rather light book is a decent beach read or a companion on a plane flight, but little more. The plot centers on a stolen work of art, and in typical Mayle style includes a romp through France, with many stops at fine restaurants and brasseries. Mayle has a wonderful way of describing the French joie de vivre, with heavy emphasis on their culinary prowess, and this work is no exception. Unfortunately, there is little more to this novel. The plot is not all that plausible, the characters uninteresting, the story not well fleshed out, and the ending is simply stupid. Peter Mayle has written some wonderful novels, but this isn't one of them. I can't even recommend this to someone who liked his other works, it is really without interest or merit. Overall, a disappointing effort, and worthy only to pass the time on vacation or while travelling."
2,"am i the only one who did not ""get"" this?","a disappointment. while the descriptions of place and food were wonderful, as always with mayle, the plot involving a real Cezanne painting and not one, but two, copies, never made sense to me. if someone else can explain the plot to me, i'd appreciate it. the owner of the Cezanne arranges to have it removed from his house and copied. Holtz was going to arrange to sell the copy as the original? and return the original to the owner along with some of the money? was Pine also going to arrange to sell a copy? or the original? was there ever a second copy? what happened, or was going to happen, to it? what role did the magazine editor play in all this? in addition to not being able to understand people's motives, i too thought that many of the plot developments were improbable. the characters repeatedly failed to recognize the obvious and they kept secrets from one another for no apparent reason. in retrospect, a most unsatisfying read."
2,clumsy and hastily penned Mayle,"I've enjoyed several of Mayle's other books, but this one is an amiable clunker. The mystery plot is buried under the guise of globetrotting and eating good food. The book would have read much better without the dumb chase scenes (the ""hit man"" following our narrator) and with more meals. After all, it's mood, ambience and food that Mayle specializes in, not characterization and plot, both of which are sorely lacking.This book is so mediocre that it's not even a good beach read. You won't care much what happens in this ""art"" mystery because the plot is so thrown together. One gets the feeling his editor said, ""Okay, we need a book in a week."" I won't hold it against Mayle since his other books are much more charming, but this one is almost totally devoid of this usual charm."
3,"Fun novel, despite the weak ending","Andre, a magazine photographer finds himself embroiled in an adventure that includes a forged Cézanne, an immaculately attired magazine editor, her ruthless boyfriend, a beautiful woman, a dashing art dealer, Paris and lots of good meals. The prose is warm and friendly, enveloping the reader instantly, the plot is well twisted, and the characters appealing. The book races from one funny and enjoyable event to the next.Sadly, instead of legging it past the finish line with a spectacular ending, Mayle shuffles and falls at the ending. It's almost as if he ran out of time and just ended the book. It doesn't match the pace and feel of the rest of the novel.But, regardless of the watery ending, the book is solid, meaty and well worth reading."
2,This is a best seller?,"I was so excited to get this book, expecially when the librarian told me that is was so marvelous. I kept reading the book expecting it to get better. I think it would have made an excellent short story. The character development was minimal and except for the descriptions of the gourmet meals unimaginative. You can skip this selection"
2,Subtitle: Peter Mayle takes a vacation from writing.,Pales by comparison to Hotel Pastis. One wonders how the editor and publisher let this book get through the mill. Mayle must have been under a three book contract. The editor must have been distracted. If you must read the book start around page 180. You won't be missing much
1,Chasing Cezanne is a very silly book.,"Save your time and read ""A Year in Provence"" instead. This was a silly book - little characterizaiton or plot, with a handsome hero and a beautiful female lead, naturally. Is there any other kind?"
2,Brainless Beach Material,"Though, that is not to say I did not enjoy it. Sometimes one simply needs to rest the brain, and this is a good book to do it with. Writing style is just ""ok"", and the story predictable, but it's a light book to read in a day, by the pool or on the beach."
2,An action thriller straight out of Gault-Millau,"As far as detective stories go, Nancy Drew is still way ahead in the game. The descriptive mix of travel and culinary delights, set against a backdrop of the lifestyle of the rich and famous, makes readers forget at times the real objective of the novel, which was to track down the Cézanne. In the end, there is still one question lurking: what is everyone having for lunch to celebrate? Good, light fun, but Mr. Mayle has done much better."
5,informative,I am really glad I purchased this book. It is a very informative book. It is nice to have a book to like this to refer to.
3,Hope sprung,"Always expecting that any film Meryl Streep is in to be fantastic, this one was just okay. Her acting is ever wonderful but the overall somber mood throughout most of the movie was a bit too long. The character of Tommy Lee Jones was just too too negative. So would I recommend the film for a bit of *entertainment, only accompanied with a tall Tommy Collins."
4,very good performances,great performances - story line ok but needed to be fleshed out more. little to graphic when talking to doctor
3,Too graphic,"So scenes were too graphic, a little less reference to oral sex would have been better for a pg rating. Uncomfortable at times"
2,Disappointed.,Was a real downer. Should have kept the ending shots in the movie.You needed some happiness and joy at the end.
2,Not what I was expecting....,Very disappointed. Cast like that and I thought it was a flop. It had good intentions but it just lacked. Very disappointed.
2,Seemed like an excuse to watch old people talk about sex,"Meh. It had its funny moments and some sweet ones, but this is not a movie I'd be interested in watching again."
3,a little let down,"These are two of my all time favorite actors. Their performances were great---solid, believeable; but the story line in the first hour was more like a documentary than a movie. It had its cute moments but I was a little let down on the overall movie. Ending was good."
2,"Love Meryl Streep, but","This is billed as a comedy. It's not. The few comedy scenes are in the trailers. Beyond that, there is nothing funny."
5,Blu-ray review,This was a gift but she said that she loved it. Excellent !! The story was great and the acting superb.
1,Hope Springs,This is a terrible movie. Not to either of these actors credit. Who ever produced or directed it should be chastised.
5,for my IPAD,"Needed some movies to download on my Ipad. I haven't watched it yet, but the download went smoothly and I am excited to be able to watch a movie when my husband and I are traveling."
1,Must have lost a lot in editing,"There's no story to this film. Jones and Streep are great actors, but nothing happens during the whole thing. We got the feeling that all of the important parts of the movie got deleted."
2,where is closed caption?,"I need closed captions and it wasn't here. This was on amazon prime rental. If I had known there wasn't CC, I wouldn't have paid for it."
4,Charming,Meryl plays a wife in a hum-drum marrage looking to spice things up again... like when they were younger.Tommy wants no part of it. But gets drawn in...A must see for older married folks.
3,Okay movie...,"I love anything with Meryl Streep but the whole premise of this movie is a little creepy to watch. If you're under the age of 50, I would stay away!"
4,Hope Springs,The movie was good with great acting but ir was more depressing for me considering my age etc.. I would recommend it.
2,My wife made me rent it.,"I really wanted tried to like this, but if this is what getting old means, I am not looking forward to it."
2,Hope Springs,We rented this because we love Tommy lee and Meryl. The movie was boring and had no real point other than they hadn't had sex for several years. There was never a reason given only hinted at. I am sorry we wasted our money renting this.
2,This dog won't hunt,"I did manage to get through it, but it was two unlikable characters, poor acting from two of the best, and weak story."
2,"Great actors, bad script","Jones and Streep were excellent, their talent was wasted on a subpar script. Steve Carrell's role could have been performed by anyone, so his higher salary was wasted as well."
1,Sooooo Disappointed!,I was so looking forward to this movie with the great actors. It was horrible. I don't think there was more than one funny moment in the whole movie. It left both my husband and I almost depressed. We then loaned the movie to some friends of ours and she called and just said that was terrible! Don't waste your money like I did!
1,Don't waste your time,"I love Meryl Streep and her movies, but this one fell flat and was a waste of time. Very slow. I do not recommend it."
2,Defective Movie,We had problems viewing this movie. The movie stopped several times during the movie. I feel like we shouldn't have to pay the full price.
1,PG-13???????,"It amazes me how Hollywood can accomplish their agenda. First, the movie was rated PG-13. There was no nudity and the language was not terrible, hence, the PG-13 rating. However, the movie, simply stated, was filthy. It starts out with an older couple, Streep and Jones, with a dull, lifeless marriage. Streep wants some life back in her marriage and signs them up for a weekend of intensive marriage counseling. The homo-sexual agenda was clear with the encouragement from the marriage counselor to purchase a book, ""Sex Tips from a Gay Man.""I was sorry that I watched the movie and would not recommend it to those that are offended regarding sodomy and open marriage experiences or suggestions."
2,Unexpectedly Boring,"We love both Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep, but we were bored throughout this movie. It never really went anywhere. We wanted to like it, but it just didn't work."
1,What a bomb!!!,"The previews of this movie on television made it look like a romantic comedy, which my wife and I both enjoy, but after ordering and watching it we realized it was a very heavy handed and cumbersome drama.All the cast members are fantastic actors! Hope Springs should have been an Oscar candidate with this powerful cast, but this show is a total flop. The cast, I believe did the best job that they could with what they had, but the script stunk on ice. It was not at all enjoyable to watch.I used to think that Fargo was the biggest waste of film, and the worst movie I'd ever seen, but Hope Springs out bombed it by a mile, and then some!My advice is don't waste you money on this DVD, but if you did, do what I'm going to do, use it for skeet shooting. It would make a much better clay pigeon than a movie."
2,Cancelled purchase,I cancelled the purchase since it would not play on my Roku device. I am looking into the problem and hope I am not charged for this item.
1,Great Actors. Terrible Movie.,"I was so utterly disappointed in this movie. Sure, I'm younger, but thought the story looked like a good one. The actors, classic. I wrongfully assumed this movie could not be bad. I was wrong. Boring, slow, not as funny as expected. My husband and I nearly walked out of this movie and we never do that. We stayed hoping for more but got nothing out of it in the end. I don't suggest buying it. Go the one-time rental route if you feel you must, but buying it would be a waste, as I'm pretty sure you would not want to sit through it more than once and torture yourself. I feel bad for writing such a poor review for such amazing actors, but this is a movie I just can't support. Heck, it doesn't support itself."
1,Disappointing,"I was really excited about viewing this film, but found it to be very disappointing. The film left unanswered questions at the end. Two thumbs down."
4,Hope Springs,A funny and entertaining movie. Good perspective of the relationship from different views of the sexes. It was well worth seeing.
3,Pretty Cute - Pretty Predictable,This was a cute movie. About what I expected. Enjoyable for an easy romantic comedy. It had some well written twists and turns that kept it interesting.
3,Good funny movie,No comment More comments ... .. . ............... .............. .......... . . . . . .... . . . .
2,I guess if you are over 40..,"Do not watch unless you can relate of course. I'm 28 and thought some parts were honest and real, but I think it would be great for the parents to watch to rekindle some old flames maybe"
4,Cute!,This was a cute movie. A little awkward at times but in a good way. I love Meryl Streep and she did a great job in this movie!
4,Pretty Good,Great acting. Story is pretty good. Won't win an Academy Award. Meryl Streep did a good job of acting un-sexy.
5,"It was funny, sweet and sometimes painful to watch... these are 2 amazing actors",May be hard to watch with your significant other... so you may want to watch it alone first..have tissues ready.. writer nailed it.
4,Sweetish,"He's an ass - not intentionally, just obliviously an ass. She's frustrated and sad. She wants to fix the marriage, he thinks it isn't broken, but - see, he's not a total ass - he goes for the counseling to please her. It's a nice story, honest without being maudlin, with a happy ending. Go for it."
3,Slow,"A little MIB mixed with The Fugitive for TLJ! If you like him, then this might be for you...the rest of the cast is weak and the story line is predictable."
3,Lots of uncomfortable moments for me,I am a young newlywed. I prefer not to see older people struggle with their marital sexuality. Nor do I like to pay to watch it played out on the big screen.
3,Good but not great,"Good topic, and the 2 lead stars are real pros. Better couples watch it together, but if not, wife first."
3,Cute but somewhat predictable,"Has some funny moments and is an overall entertaining movie. Somewhat predictable, but Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep play their parts well!"
1,Bad,Boring. Not funny at all. Thought it would be good with these actors. It wasn't. Do not bother or waste your time.
2,Yawn....,"I agree with the subpar reviews, what a waste of two wonderful stars. Meryl can hold a failed romantic view (think Bridges of Madison County). I love Tommy Lee, but he is basically an action Star. Not a good match, their energy did not sync. Meryl is Shakesperian quality. Tommy is Good Old Boy fun, bad mismatch. Both wonderful actors with the right story."
3,Too bad it wasn't better,This could have been a great movie and it was disappointing that it turned into a mediocre one. What a waste of Steep and Jones.
3,turned into a fariytale,"This was a good movie up until the highly Hollywood end. The acting was good, the story line made sense. I laughed, I sympathised. I was rooting for them all the way. But no one changes a marriage in a week. I would have been happy with the hope that these people were on their way to figuring it out. I really didn't need the perfect ending, which just undermined the credibility of the whole movie. And the scene during the credits was plain embarassing. This movie was aimed at adults. We really don't need to be clobbered over the head- we get it- it worked out! All that said, the movie is worth seeing. It addresses real issues with humor and heart."
3,Loved The Ending,The movie was good except it dragged on a bit in the middle. I especially loved the ending. Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones are great.
5,Excellent movie,"I think you definitely have to be older to appreciate this movie. There were several times when I found myself laughing at loud uncontrollably. It's well acted, and it's nice to see a movie with substance rather than a movie where an actresses sex appeal, cleavage, and butt are suppose to carry the story....although - I thought both Streep and Jones were sexy for their age!"
4,Movie Rating and Experience,"I chose this rating not because of the movie (which I thought it was a 5 star) but because we might have had a better viewing experience if it were not due to playback issues (stuttering, buffering). I don't know if these issues come from the Internet connection and bandwidth, or an overloaded server on the vendor's end of the stream. Nevertheless, I will continue to download other movies since this was only the second time we used this service."
4,I can relate,"It was funny and beside a few unnessesary foul word, that truly were not needed, I thought it was a good movie."
1,What a disappointment,"With stars like Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones and Steve Carrell I thought this was a sure entertainment pleaser. How wrong I was. It was not funny. It was not engaging. I couldn't wait for it to end. It is in my trash can right now."
3,Disappointed,I expected this movie to be funny. It only reminded me of married life's disappointments. If you like movies about the struggles of marriage then you would like this movie.
4,Funny but very true to life,"HOPE SPRINGS uses comedy to shed a bright light on the reality of marriages whose ""fires"" have nearly burned out. Lots of married couples will relate to this film. Both Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones deliver wonderful performances."
4,Enjoyed,"Didn't know what to expect. Chose the movie based on the actors. It did not disappoint. I like movies. And, this was a somewhat dark comedy."
3,Expected more,I was looking forward to seeing this movie and when it was over I thought it was just ok and wouldn't really recommend it to family and friends.
3,Hope springs eternal and you can always count on Streep!,"There's nothing greater than watching Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee jones in a movie. They really saved it from becoming a snoozefest. Streep as versatile as ever, shines with her very nuance and movement (she even plays with herself in a self-satisfying scene). Tommy Lee Jones, pensive and often a whiny andropausal man, creates believable tension between them, a couple married for 30-odd years but feeling loveless. Steve Carell is decent but can't shake off his comedic streak. At times, the movie touches a nerve or two and makes you feel, but other times, it was just long conversations and the focus is on the two great stars' acting."
3,Hope Springs but not without effort,"The film comes across in commercials as a comedy, but it is actually a frank treatment of the all-to-common loss of joy in a long marriage. Couples remain close and devoted, but lapse into dull routine and lack of passion. Old married couples--beware before going to this together! It's done well-enough, but the dialogue is obvious and I wish there was some real humor interjected."
2,Not so Good,"Despite great stars, the plot is slow and just not good. The acting is great, but that doesn't make up for the dialogue"
3,Painful to watch.,"I love Meryl Streep. I did not love this whimpy character however. Ms. Streep and I are of the same generation and I felt her character in this movie was more in keeping with the women of my mother's generation. She seemed so beaten, so timid--so boring!The movie came across as contrived, I knew from the beginning how it would end."
1,old person porno,"This movie i thought would be funny with some sexual humor but all it was, was stupid low class kick you in the balls kind of funny. I didn't even finish the movie because the story line and filler was so bad, i love the actors but the movie left much to be desired."
2,hope springs -- boooring.,not really good at all..really slow moving and boring.i thought it was going to be much better. very disappointing.
3,Great cast and story,"This was a cute movie, and I would recommend for a mature person or couple.But also for youger couple as a lessonIt shows how people get used to their routine and the lost of spark.This movie teaches many lessons"
3,Two great actors raise this mediocre movie to a watchable level,"This is enjoyable, don't get me wrong-- Meryl and Tommy Lee as a married couple; what could be more delicious. Too bad the writing and direction are average at best. And Steve Carell, imho, adds very little-- his isn't really a comic role, and he basically plays his usual Steve Carell persona fairly straight-- what's the point of that? By the same token, what's the point of this movie-- it could have been something. What it is is the kind of movie that enjoyably kills a couple hours, on an airplane or on an idle saturday afternoon."
2,The key to a good marriage is not just about SEX.,"I had to wait all the way unitl the last portion of the movie to even hear the ""L"" word (LOVE) used/mentioned. Very disappointing film starring two seasoned actors. Reflects the cultural/societal norms, values (or lack of) and priorities of todays world."
5,Great Movie,Great movie - both leads are fantastic actors! Everything movie Tommy Lee Jones does is excellent and you can't find a better actress than Meryl Streep
3,Not too interesting,Good to watch with your spouse or loved ones. Heart warming. Could be better if they could add in more comedy.
2,Yawn,"Wasn't what I thought it would be. Both actors are some of my favs, but this movie was not. If you don't want your spouse bugging you, watch it alone. lol"
4,Excellent movie for couples with kids already left home,I loved this movie. It's funny and nicely done about how a marriage can be rejuvenated after it became all routine. I recommend it for couples who's kids don't live with them anymore.
3,"Not Great, but okay","Typical ""Chick flick""... don't think the guys would like it very much. More of a movie to watch by yourself for some quiet time."
3,Hope Springs,"Both actors are superb, but movie was just a bit long. Wasn't as funny as the trailers seemed to indicate. My wife is one who really wanted to watch it."
2,Hope Springs,"We were going to watch this movie with relatives, the preview looked funny. It was a lot of sex talkin it, and it wasn't very funny."
2,what a waste!,This movie was so stupid. I don't even believe that these 2 great actor wasted their time in making this movie.
2,Disappointing,"Tommy Lee Jones delivers his lines and his character flawlessly. He is the only reason, the movie received two stars instead of one-half. Unfortunately, the story was just stupid. Most of the conversations were not interesting and the movie definitely was not entertaining. I just kept shaking my head in disappointment while listening to the dialogue between the couple and the therapist. It just did not work - sorry to say."
2,Hope Springs,It was just to slow. I thought it was boring and I was just could bring myself to follow it.
2,Disappointed in the plot,"I was really disappointed - I thought this would be about an older married couple finding love again - the focus was on sex, which is only a part of good relationship. Parts of it were uncomfortable to watch. I would not recommend this movie."
3,Nice ending,"I watched the movie because of the actors but, I was kind of dusapointed. I felt like we were intruding in their marriage counseling session and some of the details were too personal for my taste. I liked the ending though."
2,Actors or the only reason to watch,"Average or better than relationships would have trouble finding this humorous, it is kind of silly. Too bad, both actors are liked"
2,Not What I Expected.....Fewer Laughs,"I love the actors and the preview made this seem like a great comedy....the only problem, there was not many funny moments. I thought that the situation was a vehicle for a fun, laugh-filled movie----but the focus was more on the situation rather than the funny."
2,not a comedy,"This movie is advertised as a comedy, but it is a drama.You find yourself looking for the funny parts, but they just don't seam to come. It's about an emotionaly dysfunctional couple. Toward the end of the movie they are told you've made progress here is a therapist to continue with at home. They now are intimate with each other. It's a warning against letting your relationship go uncared for and how distant two people can become. It offers hope for the relationship. The only funny parts are in the trailers when you don't sees the seens leading up to them. Light hearted and funny this is not."
4,Hope Springs,"Quite a different role for both of these excellent actors, but played very well by each, and FUN to watch...."
4,Hope Springs,4 stars for extremely entertaining and funny. This movie is true to life and lets everyone laugh at themselves and see life as it really happens.
4,It's OK,All star cast and funny at times. But also very predictable at times. I have to admit I was a little disappointed but still happy we watched it.
3,Fun to watch for the Stars,"Interesting movie...not really much of a plot, but it's fun to watch Meryl and Tommy Lee. Steve Carroll provides excellent support as well. The couple, married 31 years, find themselves seeking help from ""intensive marital counseling"" and of course Tommy Lee would rather be anywhere but there. I wish there had been more back story. Can't believe that one week would change 31 years of behavior, and Meryl's character is so timid that it's hard to imagine she would really act this way. Enjoy it for what it is!"
4,"great movie for ""mature"" audiences!","It's refreshing to see a movie about a marriage that has withstood the test of time, but with the reality that often comes with such a long relationship. My husband and I have been married for 36 years and tend to take each other for granted. Watching ""Hope Springs"" provided a nudge to find ways to put the romantic spark back in our marriage.Great acting, and it passed my ""test"" of a good drama: I laughed and had tears at various points while watching this movie!"
2,Slow But Cute,Good thing the show had Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones or I would have turned it off in 20 minutes!
4,"Light, but enjoyable! Two real actors of the nth degree. Story line great screen writer could have done better","Not perfect, but fun & constructive. Jones not perfect fit, but Streep was, well Streep! Two real actors of the nth degree. Story line great, screen writer(s) could have done better."
1,Not funny,Expecting a hilarious comedy mixed with some love...huge dissappointment. Very boring. The characters were poorly written and scripted. A rather slow movie.
3,Hope Sprngs,Did not like this movie. I am married for 45 years and I was embarrassed as well as my husband at some of the things that were shown in the movie. I don't recommend it.
1,Mean old man - desperate Woman - life before death,"My wife and I both 50+ agree this is a depressing view of the longevity of a failed marriage. I don't believe the ""happy ending "" would last a week."
4,If you're over fifty and married-----watch it first by yourself.,"Lots of truth to this movie. The blame for things that go wrong in a marriage and drive a couple emotionally apart rests squarely on two sets of shoulders. Made me laugh; made me cry. The only negative is that the fairy-tale ending is a bit unrealistic for a couple with so much ""water under the bridge"" so to speak."
3,Hope Springs,"Would have been better if there had not been so much time in the therapist's office, but found it entertaining."
2,Too negative!!,I watched the movie wondering why she didn't just jerk a knot in his tail. I felt sad for her and angry with him for the entire movie. Only about 5 minutes of positive at the very end. Sorry I wasted my money.
2,Slow and sad,"Not what I expetected, very slow and sad movie. Bad choice from was expecting something like its complicated. Oh well"
2,Kept waiting . . .,It was cute and the trailer made it look great but we kept waiting for something to happen and when it finally did it was kind of anti-climactic.
2,not a comedy,"It was not the movie it was promoted to be. The ending was good though, it brought together a solution to the couples problems, but I was hard pressed to laugh through the movie."
2,Lost HD Picture,Half way throiugh the transmission the movie rebooted afor the second time and when it came back the HD transmission was lost. I paid for HD.
4,"Ideal For the ""Empty-nester""!","The movie is funny because it does have an element of truth to it. Although the couple in the movie are a bit extreme, they depict how some middle-aged couples react to not having a bustling house full of kids any more, complete with the noise, fights and rushing off to appointments. The silence is deafening and there's only the parents left going through the motions every day. Watch the movie and see what they went through to add life to their existence!"
3,Slow moving,Slow movind plot. Seems like writer drew out the movie too long then jammed in the very predictable ending. Not the worst but definitely not the best for either main character.
2,I was not prepared for a couple of the scenes...,"In context the movie was good. The acting was great. I didn't realize that the movie was going to go so vivid into detail in some areas and scenes. Quite honestly, it was awkward. I don't think anyone really wanted to see Merle Streep doing some things she did....but that's just me....if you get it, just have your remote handy......"
3,"Good movie, but wasn't really a comedy. Disappointed","Wifey picked it out, thinking that it was a comedy. She'd seen some previews. Although it was a decent movie, well acted and had a plausible story line, we were disappointed that it was more of a serious exploration of married couple issues."
2,Boring,"Although both great actors, this movie was boring and sad. It was not my favorite. 2 Hours I'll never get back."
2,Boring,Story was slow and I doze off. No big surprises and very predictable. Acting was good but the story was not.
4,Hope Springs,I would recommend this movie to older couples looking toput a spark in their marriage. It was fun to watch on a cold afternoon.
2,Not much of a comedy,"Good to see roles for these two great actors, but the script let them down, in my opinion. A pity."
2,Depressing,"This has been compared to ""As Good As It Gets"", but that movie had a good story line, humor, and it just felt good. I love Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones, but this movie was just depressing, the characters lacked depth, and I'm not a movie reviewer but my guess is just that the story was horribly written. I expected some humor because of Steve Carrell, but it just wasn't there."
1,HORRIBLY BORING,"This trailer made this movie appear to be extremely funny, it was far from that, the only funny parts were what was shown on the trailer, I love chick flicks and this was soooo boring I couldnt even watch the entire movie ...."
2,"If you think sex cures everything, even for old marriages, this movie is for you","As charming as these actors are, and they are engaging, the script feels like it was written by a young person who thinks all relationships succeed or fail based on how much sex everyone is having. (Maybe that's true, but I'm sick of those story-lines). There's a fair amount of Hollywood drivel in this movie. I had assumed these actors would have enough clout to do a realistic movie about marriage at that age. Either they don't have that clout or, in real life, they are not nearly as deep as we like to think them. My guess is this movie died by a thousand cuts of compromise and integrity."
3,Acting is good,"As you might expect, the acting is well done but the storyline is boring and predictable. Some cute moments if you cannot find anything else to watch."
2,"Could Be Worse, But Should Have Been Better","Unfortunately not even Meryle Streep could save this movie. Streep gave as much as possible, but the plot was dull and predictable. Take a pass on this one for now and wait until it's free with Prime."
2,ewwwwwwwwww,only gave it a two because they are 2 of my all time favorite actors......but it was awful......rent It's complicated.....now that was a great movie
4,Sweet and awkward,"This movie is for everyone in a serious relationship/marriage. It doesn't matter how young/old you are. The message is the same, in order to have the best relationship possible you and the one you love need to communicate and put work into all aspects of your life together. I laughed and cringed and felt sad for the characters throughout the movie. I will remember this movie and how I related to it. This movie is one I will watch again. The next time it will be with my significant other. The fact that I would be wiling to watch it again is the best recommendation I can give it. Watch it and decide for yourself."
1,"Slow, boring movie. It had so much potential with that cast.","Really slow moving movie. Great cast. I love Meryl Streep. It had so much potential with that cast, but did not deliver. It was incredibly boring. Too much negativity & conflict. Best part of movie was the last 10 minutes - but that's it. Be very careful about buying this as a gift for mom or grandma - much of the story line revolves around their lack of intimacy. (I'm trying to write this without using certain words, that might cause this review to not be published...)"
1,Definitely No Comedy Here,"If this were billed as a drama, it would have met expectations. Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones were excellent. But the only ""comedy"" came as a result of uncomfortable situations and awkwardness. I agree with the previous reviewers who said it dragged. I found myself pausing the playback to see how much longer the movie had to go before the end. Disappointing."
3,Not my favorite,I thought the movie was poorly directed and the acting seemed forced. The characters were very cliche. Did not care for this movie. I wanted to like it because I love Meryl Streep.
5,Excellent!,These two actors are so excellent you really believe they're married to each other! The story line is totally real as well! Steve Carell is the best I've ever seen him in a straight role. Definitely worth renting!
3,Watch it at home!,"I took this movie for a girls weekend at my Mom""s. Neither one of us is a prude on any level but I would have been uncomfortable seeing this at the theater. Best saved for a ""girls night"" at home."
1,do not waste money,very dissapointing-not funny AT ALL-was very surprised-always enjoy Meryl Streep-this time -nada-we all enjoy a funny movie-so just an opinion
4,hope springs,Igot it as a gift for my mom. she loves it. says its really funny Im glad she likes it.I never saw it.
1,Not what I expected,"I expected a romantic comedy. There were few funny parts, mostly awkward. It was slow moving and not at all uplifiting, mostly depressing. I wasn't drawn in by the characters. Maybe it was not for my generation (I'm 40ish)"
2,Not funny,Wasn't funny and beneath these actors to be in a movie like this. I would not recommend this movie if looking for good entertainment.
1,Big disappointment,"The previews to this movie are really misleading...too much drama. Was expecting more like ""It's Complicated"" but seemed more like ""Deep Throat"""
2,dull and tedious,"I usually like Meryl Streep; so thought I would like this movie; but found it boring, predictable, and disappointing--I took the change because of the low rental price, but would not recommend it. there was no chemistry between the main characters, and nothing to make it interesting."
2,Hope Springs a Leak,"While it is always a pleasure to watch Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones do what they do best, Hope Springs disappoints. Meryl, as usual, disappears into character- always amazing. TL Jones was very good, nice to see in a more restrained role. But, the screenplay does not deliver. It is predictable and bland. Save your money for some of Streep's and Jones' better venues"
1,Movie was terrible!,I love all the stars in this movie so I was very disappointed in this movie! BAD!!! Do not rent
3,Not a comedy,"Was expecting it to be funnier. A few chuckles here and there otherwise I thought it was just okay. Actors were great, script not so much."
2,Disappointed,"Without Meryl Steep, this would have been a total flop. We kept waiting for the action to pickup, one of the worst movies I've seen in sometime."
3,unrealistic,Sort of an over the top version of a dysfunctional marriage after 31 years. Acting is OK with three big name stars. Glad I did not pay $8-10 dollars to see it. Saw it with another couple and it was probably worth the $1.99 rental fee.
4,Cute movie,"I liked this movie, it was a little slow for me but the story line was cute, and i can see how this could happen after all those years of marriage."
2,Really awful,"Streep and Jones play a long-married couple who rekindle things in the bedroom by going to a counselor.This is neither romantic nor a comedy. It's boring and awkward and should have been rated R.It's graphic and embarrassing to watch and definitely not for children or first dates. It's like watching real therapy - not that entertaining.These are both excellent actors, but they couldn't shine with this material. I didn't see anything in their marriage worth saving, especially after looking at Jones' craggy, saggy face for two hours.Graphic bed scenes are filmed in dim light but still not for the squeamish."
2,Boring,"I expected a little time in the therapists office and the rest interaction with a lot of comedy, but it wasn't like that. I got so bored, I finally just gave up and turned it off."
2,What The?,"Although this movie deals with a much needed topic, I find it to be a slow dance around dealing with it. What is meant as humor turns out to be boring and mundane chatter. The talent that Streep and Jones have between them was wasted and smothered by poor writing and direction. I am glad they did deal with the breakdown in marriages ans communication within but IT expected far more! Soooo glad I didn't buy this movie.Disappointed in VA"
2,bad movie,This movie was an embarassment for both these fine actors. The one good thing I can say about this movie is that there was no violence in it.
3,not one of their best,The theme of this movie showed in the actor's performances. They seemed a little reluctant to act the part in the sex scenes.
3,Not for children.,The movie is rated PG13 but we felt it was not appropriate for young teens. We were watching it with our teenagers and turned if off before we were half way through the movie. There was just to much adult material.
5,good movie,This movie was very good.Good for couples who need to get that spark back into their relationship.Very entertaining movie.Good for adults but ok if kids see too.
4,WOULD WATCH IT AGAIN,"I loved it, there is still hope for romance to rekindle. Tommy Lee Jones hit his CAREACTER right on. Meryl Streepwas also great"
4,"Plenty of Laughs, great stay at home date night movie!",Great movie for a quiet even at home. The movie had plenty of laughs! We did this as an Amazon Instant Rental and playing the movie worked great over the XBox.
4,Hope Springs,"Very refreshing movie for those over 40! Excellent acting by these 2 vets. Somewhat predictable plot, but it really doesn't matter as its so well made. Relax with this and enjoy."
3,Picture quality poor.,"Picture quality was not good at times. Was disappointed, because it is not usually like that.We liked the movie."
5,A movie for grown-ups,"It's pretty clear that this is a movie for, um....people, as the French say ""of a certain age."" Tommy Lee Jones was fantastic as the clueless husband. Meryl Streep was, as always, the best. But I think Tommy Lee Jones took the show. Definitely a Must See."
5,Hope Springs,Hope Springs is an Incredabilly griping story. Movie was great and there couldn't have been better actors that played the roles. Jones and Steep were at there best!
4,Unusual and embarassingly funny movie,Good acting and screenplay. Character development was great. Original story plot and risky subjects but it really worked out. We enjoyed it immensely.
4,Good fun,As a therapist I found this very funny and several laugh out loud. All great actors at their best. Wnjoy
2,Not a 'Happy movie'.,"The guy is pits. In the end, he gets better, but still not a family movie. Im would consider it for good acting."
2,Hope Failed,I am a big fan of Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jone and was extremely disappointed in this movie. If you this movie is a comedy think again. Tommy's character is grumpy while Merly's is wimpy..
1,Hope Springs,Very disappointed. Did not like Tommy Lee Jones' character. Like him as grumpy but not as a jerk. And no where near as funny as expected
1,Awful,Good actors in a BAD movie. Don't waste your time or money. Wish I could get that money and time back.
2,NOT an appropriate PG movie...should be R,"What a disappointment!! This movie was categorized as ""Comedy"" and PG.Definitely not appropriate for teens, even with parental approval.We rented this movie because we usually like the actors in it. I'msurprised that they would make this and advertise it as PG.I realize our society as a whole has changed, but this iscarrying it too far. I would classify this as a definite R rated movie."
4,Funny,Not spellbinding but funny. If you've been married a length of time it's easy to relate more of a chick flick
3,Cute but a bit slow paced.,I think it did a great job of addressing problems with older couples.Plenty of good humor throughout the movie.
2,"Some funny moments, but long stretches of boredom","I'm not a ""have to have a laugh a minute"" guy and I like comedies that build to a good line and have a plot to them, but this was in a league of its own. It seemed like 15-20 mintues would go by with nothing happening. The acting was fantastic as you'd expect, but I was mostly waiting for the ending."
2,I did not find this to be comical.,I thought it was a depressing view of marriage! Acting was good but the story not so good. No wonder so many marriages end in divorce if this is what life ends up being like!
3,"Great actors, ok story, but not well directed.","Movie was ok, but not great for 2 such big name actors. Steve Carell does a good job as the therapist, but many aspects just seemed too long and not well tied together. Was glad we only spent $1.99 on this for 3 of us and not theater ticket prices."
3,Okay ~ Not Great!,For those of us who are older - this was a rather uncomfortable movie. I wil not see it again. One time is enough!
3,A nice film,"I enjoyed seeing Steve Carell as the ""straight"" man and Jones as the one pulling more laughs. Streep does well, as usual. There were parts that were awkward, but overall a refreshing romantic comedy. The end seemed to come quickly and neatly w/ a bow--it wrapped up so perfectly after many false starts and failures."
2,Boring!!,"This is one of the most boring and, at the same time, depressing movies I have ever seen. I don't recommend it."
3,silly movie,A silly sort of movie...Mostly about Meryl trying to get her hubby to sleep with her. Steve Carrel was pretty numb in his acting.
2,Not What I Thought It Would Be,I thought it would be a funny romantic comedy. It is not. I am sure the subject matter is applicable to some.
2,I must have missed something,"Everyone says this is a great movie. While the acting was certainly outstanding, the story itself was fundamentally and wildly depressing. Not at all the ""funny"" experience so many friends had suggested it was. And the eventual resolution was rushed and rather lacking in credibility - even for superficial Hollywood. Not a bad moivie, I suppose, but just not entertaining. Unless, of course, you haven't had sex for umpteen years and then perhaps it would be cathartic..."
5,LOVE IT!!,"Great Movie. Every married couple should have a copy. We purchased a copy for my parents. Happy, sad, heartfelt, and honest are all words I can use to describe this movie."
2,Disapointing,"This could have been an insightful look the impact of time and lack of attention on a relationship, and it could have taken advantage of two of the best actors Hollywood has to offer, but it didn't.Both lead roles became characatures rather than the characters they should have been. In particular, Tommy Lee Jones was such a cliche' of a distant husband that he was practically a cartoon.Possibly the most frustrating aspect of this movie was its failure to contect the dots between the two totally alienated people that awkwardly stumbled through counseling, and the two love birds passionately sharing a Kodak moment on beach at the end. 80% of this film depicted a disaffected couple heading for divorce, and then it rushed to wrap things up in a bow and send the viewers home happy.What a shame."
2,HopeNot,"With the leading actors and potential story line, I thought it would be a bit more ""quipy"" and entertaining. Instead--it was lots of whining between the spouses, a predictable ""stick in the mud"" husband, and mediocre dialogue. In a word...Underwhelming."
2,Not worth my time,"I was really disappointed in this movie. While Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones give great performances, the script itself was awful."
4,Long relationships in a nutshell.,"OMG! This cuts so close to the bone of many long term marriages I know. If you want a wake up a call, this offers it with humour and dignity."
2,Not What I thought...,"Based on the trailers seen on TV, I thought this was going to be a very funny movie. It was not. Watched it with other family members and they thought the same thing. Movie was actually kind of sad. Actors were good, but story was very lacking. Think my expectations, given the cast, did not meet up with the movie. I would not recommend spending the money or the time on this film."
3,"ok, but!",We really like both of these actors and expected more than what we saw. We still like them not too great in this endeavor!
1,BORING and AWFUL!!,reallly boring to watch but for Streep and Jones. The plot is familiar but the movie is not entertaining at all!
3,Stopped several times,Quality was poor. Movie stopped several times and had to restart. Circle in middle of screen stopped movie and took several minutes to restart.
2,No Hope in this Movie,"Very disappointing. I was expecting a lively comedy, instead I found the movie sad and depressing. A few entertaining moments but this is not a movie I would watch again. Very happy I bought the DVD instead of paying the price to see this at the theatre."
2,Depressing,"Not for the younger crowd, it was a very depressing and down movie and would only recommend it to people who like to see two old people fight over nothing and then fall in love again... Great actors, just not a great script, in my opinion of course."
2,Painful to watch,"The acting is very good! However, it was hard to watch a man belittle his wife and was so negative. I guess I am a sucker for happy stories that make me feel good."
1,dumb,great actor and actress but very bad movie. bought it because they were in it but would not watch again.
2,"Yawn, the Sequel","I expected a movie about two late-lifers trying to spark passion that had grown cold over the years of marriage. What Hope Springs presents is a story about two boring old fuddy duddies who were once two young boring fuddy duddies who never had much passion or spark to begin with. Meryly Streep was sexier in her Julia Childs' role, although she and Tommy Lee Jones deliver well drawn comedic profiles and make the movie watchable, even funny at times. Steve Carrel is wasted as the shrink. Too bad. Hope Springs needed an interesting subplot to give it the double-shot of Geritol with a Jack chaser that it needed."
2,Not very good movie,Did not have a good story line and was hard to stay interested in the movie. Would not recommend this to my friends.
5,loved this movie!,This movie is so funny...especial if you are over 40 and in a long term relationship...couples of all ages will be able to relate to the starring couple.
3,Not thier best picture.,I was dissappointed. Not what I am use to from either actor. Ok. but they can do better.I always get movies that these of these actors are in
2,Disappointing,"Lots of my favorite stars, but I thought it was going to be funny...it's not. If anything, it's sad. I got more and more depressed watching it. The ending seemed like ""it's time to wrap this up,"" and didn't seem authentic. Oh, well!"
3,Hope Springs with Meryl Streep,"I rented this movie because I enjoy Meryl Streep and she did not disappoint me. I also expected there to be more comedy and humor to deal with a serious topic. It is not light hearted and only okay because of it's darker, serious side."
3,Dissapointing,"was expecting more from a Meryl Streep movie , a little long, not up to par for her. Will not recommend it"
1,wow...,"I love Meryl Streep and her last few movies have been great. Mama Mia, It's Complicated, Julie and Julia...all great. This movie was one of the few times I bought a movie before talking to anyone who had already seen it. It was just straight up depressing, not any comedy at all. Very bad....A waste of my money."
1,E-gads,"I really like Meryl Streep & Tommy Lee Jones, but this movie was kind of a dud in my book. Both main characters where terribly cliched, the stream quality was abysmal which may have made the tediousness so much worse. I'm not sure what others liked about it, it was not good!"
3,Trite but very well done.,"The acting was pretty much flawless in this picture, although it was one of the few times when I felt that Meryl Streep was not 100% convincing in a role. She was only about 98% convincing."
2,"good cast, dull movie","Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones and Steve Carrell, trapped in a movie that never really gets going. Too bad."
2,Meryl Streep is the only highlight,"The story line is predictable and boring. The character played by Tommy Lee Jones is simply not believable. While the movie was not so bad that we turned it off, it was bad enough that we were constantly considering it."
3,Hope springs,"Hope springs, I like the movie. I would watch it again. it wasn't a fun movie i didn't think anyway. hope springs,"
3,Download problem,The movie itself was fine. The problem was the last few minutes of movie did not download. I hope this problem does not occur on my next purchase
2,Boo,This movie was slow and predictable I thought it would be hilarious because of Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep but much to my disappointment it had an occasional funny.
1,Depressing,"Sweet movie, but It wasnt funny enough to overcome the awkwardness of having to watch them stumble through their sexual reuniting. The ending didn't make up for the cloud of depression that hangs over the entire movie. I guess the $1.99 price tag is a clue to the popularity of this movie. I will take note before watching other $1.99 movies."
2,"How does this film ""hope"" to rekindle any romance?","I will give this film 2 stars only because Meryl Streep managed to stay ""luminous"" during this epic fail of a mature romance/comedy/drama feature film. This film will most likely have a hard time finding its audience. There are too many cringe-worthy sexual references and scenes for the older crowd and painfully slow pacing for the younger crowd. I fit into the middle-aged crowd and let's just say that I would never attempt what Meryl Streep's character attempts to do in a movie theatre. Awwwwwkward.I had high ""hopes"" that this film could be a good ""spring""board for rekindling marital intimacy, but would a couple (in this case, primarily the wife initiates the crash course) really find intimacy once again by racing through the romance part of a marital relationship only to jump right into acting out intimate sexual fantasies - with no comfortable middle ground? Probably not."
4,Good movie for us AARPers,NIce to see a story about the issues us empty nesters face. Great acting by two of our most acccomplished actors.
3,"Somewhat heartwarming, but lacking","While Meryl Streep can do no wrong (and hasn't done wrong in this film), this film overall was lacking depth. The first 20 minutes or so of the film are very depressing, followed by a slightly less depressing middle part of the film, and more depression towards the end, with one bright moment in the last 5 minutes of the film (part of which plays during the credits). Steve Carrell plays his part solidly, and Tommy Lee Jones nails his character- but unfortunately his character was written as more of a drasticly exaggerated charicature of a grumpy old male spouse, rather than realistic one. If you're 50 years old or older, you may get some mindless enjoyment out of this film for what it is (and this is the demographic it was really written for), but it lacks in many areas and isn't very enjoyable for anyone younger than that."
1,Awful.,"How did this get rated PG-13? The sexual content was through the roof.I thought Hope Springs looked like a cute, funny movie about a husband and wife falling in love again. And maybe it was - but I sure didn't get that far. I think my husband and I made it about 25 minutes into the movie before turning it off. I don't really care to watch random people ""exploring themselves"" or learning how to give their husbands oral sex.One thing is for sure - Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep do a great job at acting uncomfortable. Although they probably didn't HAVE to act during those scenes. Yikes.Glad I rented instead of buying it, but still sad about being out $4. I could have used that to watch a clean, decent movie. Bummer."
1,total tripe,"Don't know what all the fuss was about ...this was the most boring, and painful movie to watch in recent memory."
2,Had hope I would be entertained,It was ok but I had higher hopes for the movie. It didn't seem to really explore how they got where they were. Sort of glossed over....ok ending and some light moments. Trailer definitely better than the movie.
3,Hope Springs,"It was okay. It's a little slow in places, but I love the stars so it was definitely worth seeing."
1,was not able to watch it,"I was never able to see the movie, I rented it to watch on an airplane, I guess it did not download all the way, I was able to see 1 minute of it, and I only had 24 hours to see it, that was the only time I had to watch it, and by the time I was available, it was no longer an option, I feel I should get my money back or a chance to watch it, but I can't figure out who can help me."
2,No hope this spring,Meryl Streep is my favorite actress.Tommy Lee Is one of my top male actors.This was just embarrassing. Steve Carrell was actuallythe best of the three. Thank goodness I didn't see it in themovie theater. I would probably have walked out.
2,Hope Springs,"Story plot seemed to be innocent and full of hope - but sprung a major leak.My hopes sprung from the anticipation of a movie that would truly bouy up the thought that hollywood could turn out an endearing film that encouraged couples, couples at any stage in their marriage, to revisit their relationship beginnings and finding the time to enjoy being with one another in mutually enjoyable settings as well as living through the rigors of everyday life.This film simply focuses on the inept directions of a supposed therapist with regard to the couples lack of sex in their life as the be all end all fix for their marital woes."
1,"Soooooooooo slow, major chick flick","This was such a slooooooooow movie, and full of old people sex, which was just disgusting. . Great movie for really old couples like your grand-parents, horrible for anyone else."
5,Wonderful film,I thought the film explored the problems that development in a marriage very insightful way. The acting was suburb. The story was well crafted. I think it is an evening well spent watching this film and especially married couples.
2,Hope Springs is weak.,Hope Springs had good actors but it could have been so much better I would have thought. Some scenes should have been dropped.
2,very little action and not very entertaining; also poor lighting,way too drawn out with little action involved. some of it was entertaining and real-life like but not filmed well.
4,very cute,good message good acting steve correl in a not comedy roll was more than passable i need five more woods in order to submit
3,Saves the best for last,"The movie is a bit of a downer, 3/4 of the way through it starts getting a little better. More on the serious side and less on the funny side."
4,Cute Movie,Cute movie that you can watch with your significant other or girlfriends.Feel good movie. Hit the mark with us older couples.
1,Boring overdone waste of time,"This was one of the worst movies of all time. It ranks right up there with plan nine from outer space, except this movie was more boring than plan nine from outer space. Hideous."
3,Just an OK Movie,Only had a few good spots.....just an ok movie..don't think that I would see this one again but now that is all I have to say...
3,3 1/2 stars for a mature romantic comedy with 2 acting legends,"Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones provide yet another acting lesson, this time as a married couple of 31 years. Their marriage has gone stale to the point Kay (Streep) signs them up for a 1 week getaway in Maine for marriage therapy. Arnold (Jones) wants no part of it, but reluctantly goes along, bitching the whole time. While Arnold and Kay don't even sleep in the same bedroom any longer or even touch each other, there is still some deep rooted love needing exploration.The explorer/therapist is played with perhaps a little too much seriousness by Steve Carell. Surprisingly, the story is short on humor. The best scenes involve watching the couple squirm when the issue of sex is discussed. It's pretty much all there in the trailers but Kay and Arnold and their issues will certainly be recognized by many in the audience. There's not much of a story here, but it's always enjoyable to see Streep and Jones do their thing, this time together."
1,Worst movie ever,This movie was a disgrace for such talented stars. I was totally disgusted with the movieand very disappointed and surprised at the rating.
1,movie not received,"I didn't realize I was ordering a movie via streaming video. I searched all over and could not find how to get my money back and cancel my order. Very bad customer support, shame on you..you big, rich corporate conglomerate, heartless money hogger."
2,Funny? Touching?.......Boring!,"Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones; has to be a winner, right? Wrong. This movie was not entertaining, funny, touching, sweet, or hopeful. Rather than eliciting sympathy, empathy, or general feelings of tenderness towards Streep's character, Kay, and her plight, Kay's one dimensional meekness elicited nothing but irritation. And what was the deal with Arnold? Did I miss something or did he never reveal why he became a stodgy, complaining, dissatisfied grouch? Steve Carell's performance as the warm and caring Dr. Feld was the one saving grace of the movie. Even that isn't reason enough to watch it. Sadly, I can not recommend this dud."
3,More Drama Than Comedy,"Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones' stellar performances draws out the disturbing storyline of a husband with major intimacy issues who keeps his wife at bay by controlling and bullying her. Their relationship issues weren't merely loss of passion and boredom. The film was strategically marketed as a comedy, but the sex therapy was more awkward than funny. The shame is that the main plot reinforces the concept that sex is the solution to troubled marriages.[...]"
3,Surprisingly unimpressive film given the cast,"We're never giving any insight into these characters, so it's pretty hard to care about what is happening with them. There was great potential to tell a story here, but it was never mined. We never really understand why she suddenly feels a need to reignite the sexual aspects of the marriage after such a long time, or for that matter why he is so resistant. The scene in the hotel room when he looks at her and stops---- what was that? That just really muddied things up with no later resolution.Then ending just sort of muddles to a stop, though the sequence in the end credits was cute."
4,Always great to watch Meryl and Tommy act!,"Really fun movie to watch, especially for middle aged couples -- who will probably easily relate to what this couple goes through. LOL"
3,For the more MATURE crowd,It is a very slow movie. I would say this is for the over 50 and married crowd. Not what I expected from the two actors at all.
4,Being close to that age I could relate,I thought Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep worked well together.Being close to that age group I could relate.
4,Very Funny,This movie is taboo in the sense that it talks and discusses at great length in this comedy the sexual behaviors of seniors.
2,Depressing but well acted,"Acting is good, but the movie is very slow and painful to watch. It's quite depressing. It's just like experiencing the problems and emotional pain of real life relationships that one often experiences when they are unhappy and stressful. With the state of the economy and overall stress of our troubling times, I would rather escape the sadness of the real world and be uplifted, entertained and inspired when I watch movies. I did not feel any of these by watching this movie, even with a ""happy"" ending that actually did not make sense to me given just how unhappy this couple was. It was difficult to believe that they could overcome their serious issues. For the most part is was well acted, but in the end, I didn't ""buy it."""
3,Hard to rate,"I really enjoy these actors, and the story, though a little weak, hits home for those of us who are getting older. I get the feeling that the subject matter was just a little too meaty to deal with in film. I was expecting a silly comedy, but the funny parts were laced with pathos, so it was bittersweet rather than ""lots of laughs."" Streep was really brilliant, as was Steve Carrell, who played the marriage counselor. I've decided that the movie was worth watching, but I won't watch it again to catch easy-to-miss moments. The value of the movie is what it evokes in the viewer, which is a personal review of one's own life. I'm not sure that younger viewers will really get it; as a matter of fact, I hope they never do."
3,A little disappointing,"We LOVE these two stars and we looked forward to this ""later life"" story. We were disappointed in the language...totally unnecessary...and the lack of good writing which could have made this story really a good one. The only reason it was worth watching were these two who could turn a bad script into a good one anyday! But kind of a flop in our opinion. Too bad."
4,Hilarious movie,Covers material that should be of interest to all senior married couples. I never though Tommy Lee could be funnier that Billy Crystal.
1,What was this?,"I have to admit, I only watched the first ten minutes...Great Actors and Actresses do not the movie make...hope it got better after I quit watching it...makes for an unusual drink coaster."
3,marriage counciling is not funny,This movie is very slow.....although with top actors they did a good job with this. The subject matter was very intense.
2,Very Dissappointed,"It wasn't really funny like I thought it was supposed to be, but it was a decent story just not what I was expecting."
2,Two great actors in a really slow movie,Movie not what we were expecting. Very slow and uninteresting. Movie download stalled toward the end and we didn't care because it was just plain boring.
3,Not that entertaining for me!,"I thought it was going to be a comedy, if so, not my type of comedy. Too real to be funny."
3,Not funny,Ok movie but I thought it was a comedy. Not funny. it was kind of sad and the 10 minutes the best.
1,hate it,So boring and a very slow moving movie. Of course there were funny parts but not enough to make the movie good. I guess it could have been boring because the wife was bored and depressed in the movie.
2,Slow Moving and Serious,"The previews led me to believe the movie would have a serious undertone but with much humor however this is not at all the case. Initially there are some funny moments between the husband and therapist and you think there will be more to follow, however there are not. It is well acted of course with such a great cast, but the story and relationship between the couple develops very little. Overall the movie is slow and rather depressing!"
1,defective manufacture,"Movie gets to the same spot and will not go forward. Period.Amazon promptly sent a replacement and just had a chance to view and it does the same thing. We finally found that playing the movie with the "" remarks"" soundtrack that it would play. I am sure it is a production problem."
1,Probably not,I love the three main stars in this show but all that talent just wasn't enough to save this movie. Too bad.
5,entertaining,"Really enjoyed this real life movie, both great stars helped portray the real to life scenario, funny and thought provoking, entertaing in every way."
1,not comedy,"How could this be so dark, tragic and repugnant? all great actors, potentially fun and funny plot but misses the humor of reality in a big way. Turn it off...."
1,Stay away from this one.....,"I like Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones but this movies is a train wreck. The leads are not characters, they're caricatures. This is about a couple who have drifted after 30 years of marriage but instead of digging into their relationship the movie sends the message that all they need to do is resume their sex life and everything will be fine. Plus the soundtrack gets intrusive quickly -- every scene seems to have ts own song.DO NO WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS!"
4,sweet,"Funny, sweet movie which really speaks to the limited audience of mid-life couples. a younger generation wouldn't get it, and singles would find it sappy or boring, but it worked for me."
4,These two really made this movie work!,This movie wasnt really what I thought it would be but it was very interesting.. Had alot of funny moments and some sad ones too... every couple who has been married and is or has gone through this should see this movie...
5,Hot funny movie,"Meryl Streep is a great actress in this movie.She had me laughing so hard, I cried.Everybody should see this film! It is hillariest."
3,Not what I expected.,They are both such great actors and they did a wonderful job but it was such a downer. Most of the time you just want to smack Tommy Lee. :) And Meryl for putting up with it. Great staying power. Good ending. Great acting.
4,Sleeping love,The movie depicted an empty nest couple that has lost the love that marriage brings to a relationship. They were in a rut that life brings from the repetitive tasks of daily living.A trip to Maine and a therapist makes both of them to think about why love left their marriage.
1,Meryl Streep masterbating....,"Watching Meryl Streep masterbate is not on the top of my list of things to watch... turned it off at that part, wish I would have turned it off much sooner!"
1,Slow and Boring. Pass on this One.,"I liked the trailer for this movie and looked forward to seeing it. I ended up checking it out from our local library instead of renting it. I am so thankful that I did! I would have felt horrible if I'd wasted $4 renting this movie. I expected a funny and fun movie. Instead, this movie is slow and very uncomfortable to watch. I didn't like watching or listening to the counseling sessions (which weren't funny) or the physical scenes that played out afterwards. I'd definitely recommend finding something else to watch."
2,I wouldn't like this if it was free,HOPE SPRINGS This movie is great if you want to go to sleep.The only hope I had was it would soon be over.
2,What a disappointment.,"I was excited to watch Hope Springs both because of the actors and the story line. The couple who have been married for 31 years now live like to two roommates. For their 31st anniversary, they gave each other the extended cable package! The woman wants the passion they had in the beginning so she forces her husband to attend a week long marriage counseling session. The husband has no interest but goes along complaining every step of the way. Then, just as we expect, he has a change in heart and they live happily ever after. What a waste time, money and energy from Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones. I expected so much more from them."
3,Disappointing,"Great cast, great premise for a story - just didn't deliver. Seemed like they cut out too much ... lots of conflict through most of the movie, then BAM! problem solved."
5,Great movie!,This movie was fantastic! Great story line. I laughed at Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl's characters. They were perfect. But the best part was the coming together parts. Talk about a tear jerker...in a good way. Steve Carroll did a perfect job as the marriage counselor. Interesting to see him play a straight role. He was great.
2,Would not recommend this movie,"I just did not like this movie at all . Tommy,s character was deplorable and Meryl's character was pitiful. The movie made me very uncomfortable...glad I didn't see it in a theatre."
2,painful,"This movie was awkward and painful to watch. The performances were great, but the characters were unlikable and unbelievable. The wife was too long-suffering to be real and the husband was unrealistically detached from reality."
1,HOPE SPRINGS FROM AMAZON,unfortunately for me this DVD did not work in Australia even though I took particular care in ordering for my region. I have repurchased here recently when it become available
3,Hope Springs,"Hope Springs , in my opinion, would be suited for mature audiences because of the context which is discussed. I thought ""Hope Springs"" was slow at times."
4,Cute renewed love story!,"I love Meryl Streep so I will enjoy ANYTHING she is in, and this was no exception. She plays her part (s) so well.This wasn't filled with lots of action that kept you on the edge of you seat, but it was a nice story about a longtime marriage that had gone a little stale, and her determination to change that! I will watch it again some time. Both leads did a good job."
3,Good movie,The video transmission was pretty clear and good. We sometimes had to wait for the streaming to catch up .
2,"very slow, very little comedy",I kept waiting for the movie to get better. Very slow. Boring. And pretty unbelievable. Tough to fix a marriage that has been bad for years in one week of once a day sessions.
2,"promising cast, but not a good movie","Some of my favorite actors, but the script was not good and stereotypical. Sad waste of brilliant actors. Hollywood needs to regroup and start making some quality films."
2,Slow moving,"Not very interesting, whole movie is the inside of a therapy session. All the 'previews' is the very end of the movie. Disappointed and not worth the money."
2,Disappointing,What a waste of such a good cast. So much more could have been done with the topic and the great lead actors.
2,Could have been good...,This film had great potential (as any film about healing a marriage does). I thought it was going to be deep...but it was mostly just about the couple's sex life in the end. Very disappointing.
1,Disappointment,"Althought this movie had 2 of my favorite actors, it was an utter disappointment. It didn't really ""go anywhere"" in the plot development."
1,Hope springs,The movie was recommended. I wanted to see it because of the cast. What a disappointment.i will gladly watch any Jane Austen movie. Guess that explains it.
2,Could have been a much better movie.,Very bad choice of senes in the movie. Very bad for older people to enjoy.View tips and guidlel ines
2,The plot is a mess,"So if you're in the micro demographic that might be interested in seeing two sixty-somethings go for marriage counseling, you might hope for some charm and humor from the two great actors, but even they can't save the poor writing. Absolutely no narrative trajectory, no insight into why either of them behaves as they do and even less explanation of what brings about the final happy ending.You're left feeling like too much ended up on the cutting room floor.And I just couldn't get used to Steve Carell in a serious role. He's fine, but you keep waiting for the zinger that never comes. A few jokes would have been an improvement."
1,Amazon Problem,"How do I get my money back? I went back to Amazon, and looked for a category that applied to my problem, which was that there was a technical difficulty prohibiting me from watching the movie. Appears to be a bandwidth problem, which I do not have with NetFlix streaming video. As Amazon tests for this prior to playing the movie, I didn't expect this issue. All of the return policies are worded for merchandise, so this seemed to be the only avenue for a remedy."
1,don't get this movie,"the previews to this movie was good. so i watched it, and i thought it was a really, really, AWFUL movie. mr. jones and ms. streep are great actors but this was their worst movie. i felt like i was a fly on the wall(spying on my parents (love) life. i kepted thinking somebody please comes by with a fly swatter and smack me with it or brings bug spray and spray my eyes out. if older couples are having marriage trouble this movie would(might) help them. if you are the type who knows that your parents kiss, make out, etc. but get grossed when they do it in front of you, your friends, or in public, don't rent this movie or buy it."
5,excellent show.,This is a great movie. Every couple should see this show. It exposes so many problems that many people face in life!
4,Well Done,The blend of comedy with a current plausible message merged with good acting and good script a very enjoyable movie.
5,great movie,"Fun movie....love Meryl Streep.NIce change from movies with lots of explicit language, etc. Light, fun comedy. Would recommend it to anyone."
3,Some funny parts...but overall kind of sad...,This was billed more as a comedy and while there were some funny parts the overall movie was more serious and kind of sad.
3,"Acting was great, thin on substance","Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones are great, and the movie starts out with promise, but then gets bogged down in being mostly about sex. Left out are development of common interests - outings and conversation. Disappointed."
3,The Actors Make Hope Springs,"Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones are excellent actors, so the movie was good only because of them. The story line was too realistic for my taste--I prefer to be entertained rather than suffer through someone else's problems. I was uncomfortable with their openness about their sex life, probably because I am of the older generation where such discussions were taboo. Today's young people would think nothing of it."
3,Who is the Target Audience,"Hope Springs was okay. I love Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones, but I don't know who the target audience is. Young people cannot relate adn older people would have issues with the topic. Some funny moments, but over all the movie was a little sad."
2,Great for Grandma and Grandpa,This movie is sad. It is geared toward the nursing home crowd. It was painful to watch. I don't recommend it unless you are having trouble sleeping.
2,Hope Springs,"With these two starts how could the movie go wrong? Well, the reason I'm glad I watched this movie is to tell you NOT to spend you time or money watching this movie. I thought it would be a light hearted funny movie. No. It was depressing, boring, uncomfortable watching two stars heavy breathing and forcing themselves to make love. Nope. Do Not Rent this."
3,"Giving 'head' in a darkend theater, ugh!","it was an obvious 'reach' for humor, (oral sex,) that demeaned the rest of the story, completely unbelievable and ruined the story."
4,Perfect movie for the boomers of today,My sister and I both throughly enjoyed this movie. It made us laugh as well really give thought to our own lifes as we age and how easy it is to get set into a routine. It is nice to see a movie that deals with middle agers who struggle.
3,Hope Springs,I enjoyed the mature content and the interaction between Streep and Jones. I would recommend this movie. I wish that we had more movies about older love affairs and marriage.
2,"It was interesting, not quite what I was expecting.","It had it's funny moments, but overall it was very dry and long. There wasn't enough comedy in it and it was more serious. Yet Tommy lee jones and meryl streep did an excellent job in this movie they played the parts really well. This is a movie for a couple who is struggling with there own sex live who don't have a clue to get back the spice in there life, this would be good for that kind of person to watch. Otherwise it's not one I personally would ever watch again. Thanks!"
3,"Its was funny, but would be embarassing to watch with a group of people","My wife and I watched Hope Springs and we were glad we saw it alone at home instead of in a group or at a theater. The subject matter is embarrasing. The movie was enjoyable, but not as good as other Meryl Streep films."
4,Great movie!,This movie targets movie watchers who are older. It''s a movie that touches someone 50 or older who is learning to live with the changes in their life. No longer a teenager with a body that responds at the drop of a hat. It is a heart warming movie that deals with love but a more basic factor that time moves on and it's changes in us does not stop for anyone. It is a very good movie.
3,Hope,"I love these two actors and I watch most of their movies. This movie has some funny scenes but all in all falls a little short. The acting is great as you would expect but the story was not up to the same level. Take it or leave it, there are better movies."
2,Just Ok.,Thought this would be more of a comedy. A little to sad for me. Even though the mood picks up it just wasn't my cup of tea.
3,Happy ending.,"Cute story. Predictable but very entertaining. Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones in the same movie, you can't go wrong."
2,slow and boring,"honestly this story was not funny, not deep and actually quite slow. There was so many lost opportunity for humer. The whole and only premise to the story was about trying to revive the sex life after 30 years of marraige. Thats all you get!"
1,Toilett Humor,I was expecting alot more from this two actors. The humor was crude and inappropriate for a couples movie.If you need a stage film THIS is a good choice.
3,Hope Springs needed more spring,"This movie is worth viewing and I do recommend it. The performances were good - I liked the cast. It wasn't glamorous so the story plot is believable. The humor is entertaining - but I was hoping for more humor. The movie was not fully a drama nor fully a comedy. But I guess I was hoping this would be like ""As Good As It Gets"": a good balance of drama, comedy, great script/story line, superb acting and highlighted by enough ""belly laugh"" moments."
3,Not a comedy,I thought this movie would be a light comedy but it is more like a docu-drama about losing sexual desires for your partner as you age. Acting was good and subject thought provoking.
3,Okay,Movie is good for Streep and Jones fans but is not really that great. About a couple who doesn't have sex anymore - that's about it
4,Unique comedy,"This movie started a little slow but it was a really good movie. I really liked it. I think they could have added a little more comedy to it but overall, this movie is a movie I can watch again. I think they should have added just a deeper plot but after watching the movie I did want to keep it for my collection. It was unique and well played. I think the idea at the end of the movie was well protrayed. No matter how old your relationship is, you can still keep it young by falling in love again."
1,Low battery capacity problem,"The rechargeable batteries in four of these recently purchased units do not provide their stated capacity. They have much lower capacity than their stated 900 mAh, and 3 of 8 batteries did not retain a charge even several days without use.Instead of the Steripen-estimated 35 1-liter purification cycles per battery charge, I got 15. This battery capacity might continuously provide only 3 purified liters per day when solar charging. More details in the report at:http://www.charlespreston.net/solarcharger/SteriPEN-Solar-Charging-Case-Test-Report.pdf"
1,Lousy Germination,"My children and I ordered a selection of really fun seeds from you. (Hmong Red CucumberBlack Sea Man Tomato, Rare Tigger Melon, Mexican Miniature Watermelon, Toga Striped Eggplant, Purple Cauliflower, Unwins Exhibiton 7 Pound Onion, Rare Red Bull Brussels Sprout)My germination rate has been about 25% or less. All my other seeds from other companies are doing wonderful on my tables, but my Hirt's seeds are in a category of their own, small, stunted, wimpy, or not at all. I will not be ordering from you again, and I'm sorry I wasted my money."
1,No good,I am a trained in seed germination. Every seed in this packet had root damage in the embryo and was not able to produce a seedling. Zero. I won't buy from this vendor again.
1,Hmong Cucumber,Picture of red cucumbers is very deceiving. The internet has plenty of warnings about the misleading advertisement about this product. This issue is not specific to this vender but others are advertising the Hmung with pictures of red cucumbers-shame. They get rusty orange at best.Good producing vines but found to be very seedy if harvested at rusty brown stage. Would not buy again.
1,0% germination rate,"Don't bother. Don't bother. Don't bother. Don't bother. Don't bother. Don't bother. And now, I've reached the twenty-word minimum, exactly."
1,What a Cuc I saw red,Thought it would be nice to grow these and serve at a party..Nothing came up...Disappointed.
1,be careful,"I was considering buying these seeds because I liked the interesting color. While the reviews of Hirt's aren't too bad at amazon, they sure are bad at Dave's garden watchdog. Amazon removed the link so you will have to google it yourself if you want to see how bad the reviews actually are in a non-loaded environment."
1,Macabre,"Be forewarned: This book, while perhaps intellectually interesting for the right (horror-loving) audience, is extremely macabre. It would better be called, ""Toads are from Hell."" It is not a book for the unsuspecting reader who is a nature- or amphibian-lover or a person interested in the depiction of animals in art and literature. Most of the artwork and writings presented here focus on the association of toads with disease and moral corruption --- think grotesque images from Bosch. If you are drawn to that which others find bizarre perhaps you will enjoy this admittedly unusual volume."
2,disappointing,"Somehow not up to her earlier work. The instrumental accompaniment is good, but tends to dominate at the expense of Cesaria's voice and the songs don't strike me as particularly memorable. One reviewer said this was perhaps the best thing she's done. If so, I just don't see it. I was disiappointed and found myself wondering if maybe her best days are behind her. I hope not."
2,Terrible packing ruins a good product,"I ordered 4 of these and Amazon put them all in a small box with almost no packing material, and they bounced around during shipping, putting dents and creases in them, some up to 1/4"", and bending the connectors so I had to use pliers to straighten them. These batteries are not light, and need to be packed better. They did measure around 6.3 volts, so it didn't short circuit them internally, but I have to wonder about their long term durability now."
2,"Item good, packaging not so good","Box was totally inadequate. Split on two corners, badly banged up all around. Fortunately each battery was wrapped in bubble wrap so they are not on their way back (yet). (June 2012)"
2,Nice trying,"This book claims to have it all but I am sorry I bought it. It toutches a lot of aspects regarding old toys but with not enough examples. I expected the book to be full of old toys' pictures. For people with now ideas regarding ""old toys"" it has some nice aspects"
2,Too Boring,"I hoped this book would be a cool picture of the past that would draw kids into history through something they love: toys. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver. It was a little boring, talking about blocks and common things like Jacob's latter. There were some pictures, but they were of kind of boring stuff, like a disk on a string that spins when you tighten the string.Overall there were too many common and boring things without much about each one, just the stuff you would already know.At the back there WAS a cool activity about spinning a disk with a picture on the top half of one side and the bottom half of the other to form one picture when spun, however there was only one activity and the rest of the book was lacking.I wouldn't recommend buying it."
2,Works better on cats,"I bought this because my kids are afraid of dogs and some dog owners don't seem to care.What I found is that, although dogs will generally jerk their head around when I press the button, it doesn't seem to phase them much. I even held it within a few inches of a neighbor's barking dog, and the dog just kept on barking, although another dog in the same yard retreated back to the house.It does, however, make my cats jump and run, which may be useful to some people."
1,Absolutely no effect,"This product does not work. The lights flash but no dog or cat has even flinched. Standing right next to a friendly dog and pointing straight at the dog there was absolutely no reaction. Not a flinch, not a twich of an ear and definitely not scared away. If it didn't work on this timid little guy what chance does it have on an aggressive dog?"
3,"Wakes Up Dogs, Cats Still Coming","So far, my Dog Chaser has managed to wake up the neighbor's dog when it was sleeping. The dog woke up, looked around, and barked a lot, so the device seems to generate some sound dogs don't like. I was hoping that when I aimed it at a dog, the dog would run the other way. I was also hoping that it might discourage the neighbor's cats from climbing my fence, but so far they're still in my yard. Maybe they have deaf cats."
1,"It is not sold for Chile, ¿why?",I have been looking for this product on the web in order to buy it from Chile through Internet. Finally I found it in Amazon... but it is not sold to Chile!!!
3,Good for general labor- not specialty.,"Decent pair of gloves for general labor type uses. You have to be pretty sure of your hand size when you order, as they fit snugly and you would notice quickly if they didn't fit. Not good for any labor that involves handling objects that are more than warm. The black grippy areas on the fingers and palm are plastic or rubbery and they melt."
4,On my second pair,This is my second pair. Bought my first ones about a year ago. I too have seen the stiching give out befor the material. But none the less they are great gloves. I use them for just about everything. Hope my second pair are as good as my first.
3,Good idea but durable enough?,"I purchased a pair after seeing some designed for mechanics. I have a desk job, and weekend remodeling has been destroying my hands. These gloves are a great idea and do work well. I can work hard for two days framing, wiring, sheet rocking, with virtually no wear to my hands. I can do just about everything with them on, with the exception of peeling tape from a roll. However, after only three days of use, the stitching on the palms started to break apart. I don't know how much longer they are going to last. When these go, I will look for a similar product of higher quality."
1,NOT Pleased with performance(WASTE OF MONEY),Our company installs manufactured housing and we need gloves that are very durable and comfortable I thought that these gloves would do the trick so I bought 5 pairs for my crew several different sizes from Med to XLarge Hevy Utility after only a couple of days they started to fall apart the Duraclad Re-enforcement pads peeled away and the leather palms developed holes in them But I do have to say that they were extremly comfortable though not very useful in cold weather or in wet muddy conditions I dont think I will purchace the cold weather version of these gloves eitherNONE OF OUR GLOVES LASTED MORE THAN A MONTH
1,Lasted less than a month,"I used a pair of these gloves for less than a month and the stitching on the fingers gave out in one place and had started to come apart in about 3 others. I had used the gloves around my home, doing light carpentry and groundswork.It appears from the reviews that I'm not the only one to have this problem.I called Ironclad and they said, probably defective, no problem just return to amazon - which I did, and received a full refund.I'd be willing to try them again, but I ended up purchasing a different brand from a local vender."
2,Finger & thumb fell apart the 1st day...,"The first day I used these I was hanging drywall with screws. About 2 hours into it the DuraClad on the thumb and index finger of the left glove were worn through (something that doesn't happen with good leather gloves) and the seams were coming apart. So, I wrapped 'em with duct tape and that did the trick.I liked the velcro at the wrist and the fit was good for my hands, but I doubt I'll buy 'em again. I can buy three pairs of good leather gloves at Costco for less than one pair of these, i.e. more glove-life for the money witout the hassle. If they get the price point down maybe I'd buy again.Using several layers of duct tape and gluing down the various pieces of DuraClad as soon as they started coming off, the gloves lasted about a month and a half. Maybe it should be not-very-durable-DuraClad. I guess for lighter duty they'd work well, but not for remodel work I put 'em through."
4,Comfort is Key!,I have been a cabinet maker for over 20 years now - and I have yet to come across a pair of gloves that EVEN COMES CLOSE to the fit and quality offered in Ironclad's Heavy Utility. The fit is beyond awesome - giving me the ability to handle the samllest nails and take any type of measurement. The durability of the gloves is great too - the pair I am currently using has lasted me over SIX MONTHS!
2,good fit and design but...,"These gloves have a great fit and pretty good design however, I had worn them for approximately one hour before the first stitching had given way. I see from the other reviews this is a common problem. Given that I work with rocks, dirt and other abrasive materials, I'm questioning the wisdom of spending [$$$] for a glove whose stitching gives up the ghost in the first 1/2 hour of use. I won't buy another pair unless the quality of manufacture goes up."
3,NOT SO HAPPY,"I HAVE USED ALOT OF BRANDS OF GLOVES, TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT ONE FOR ME AND THE WORK THAT I DO (I BUILD FENCES AND DECKS). THE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE IS THAT THE FINGERS WEAR OUT TOO FAST,I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT THE SAME THING HAS HAPPENED WITH YOUR GLOVES. MAYBE I GOT THE WRONG TYPE FOR HEAVE CONSTRUCTION, IF SO PLEASE RECOMEND THE RIGHT TYPE."
2,Poor performer,"I bought these Heavy Duty gloves with high hopes. They did prove to be comfortable and better than leather in wet environments. However, after a mere six weekends of light to medium do-it-yourself work, the gloves have failed. For the $30 investment, I find their performance wholly unsatisfactory when it comes to durability."
3,"Good idea, room for improvement","I purchased these in the hopes that they would be much more durable than the leather gloves I had been wearing out in less than a month. I found that the palm and finger tip covering was very durable, however the stitching that holds those pieces on isn't up to the task. Also the spandex on the sides of the fingertips is now letting my fingers through. If I may be so bold as to make a couple of suggestions, if the entire fingertip was wrapped in the kevlar or at least the sides having leather isnstead of the spandex, it would be a huge improvement. And if they could come up with a little tougher thread these gloves would be excellent."
1,Not very pleased about the durability.,"I bought these gloves for my husband to protect his hands from becoming dry and cracked. He drives a delivery truck and lifts bundles of linen tied with string. When I read about these gloves, it sounded as though they would be durable and waterproof. They are neither. We have had them for approx. 2 months and 4 out of 5 fingers on each hand have torn through the tips.POOR!!"
1,Very Expensive Disposable Gloves,"I should have read the other reviews more carefully before buying!I am a homeowner/handyman, and I used these gloves for about 9 hours of light demo before the stitching in one of the fingers started to fray.Before they started disintegrating, I had no problems with the gloves. They were comfortable, the grip was good, and I enjoyed the good tight fit. I found they gave me the dexterity to do things that I couldn't do with my regular cheapo work gloves. I did find myself having to take them off every once in a while for tasks that demanded a little extra dexterity, and in those cases, the wriststrap/tight closure was kind of a hassle. But if the gloves had held together, they would have been worth the price.However, given the way these have held up, it is unconscionable that these items are being marketed as anything other than disposable! Save your money!"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"These gloves are comfortable to wear, howeverthe leather separated and disintegrated on the middlefingers on the SECOND USE. These are NOT heavy duty glovesas advertised. Not even light duty gloves. Very disappointed."
4,John W. what can I say.,"Two good old movies by the ""Duke"". Like to watch these type movies, with good morals given for the most part."
1,Cookbook,"I actually ordered the wrong book - got this instead of the ""Hail to the Chef"" that I wanted. This had some good recipes, but overall I wouldn't have ordered it. However, it was so inexpensive that I kept it and will recycle by donating to my local library."
1,I Would Love This If I Could Afford to See It.,"I love City Hunter. But the people selling City Hunter 3 and '91 must have learned selling techniques from drug dealers. I was able to buy the first two seasons of City Hunter, which are like - 52 episodes each, mind you - for between 20 and 30 bucks. Now they want over two hundred dollars for a season that's not even half the usual amount of episodes? And I mean I love that show, but that's ridiculous."
3,Too short,"If this season would consists of two collections (like the first two), there would have been 5 stars on top of this review.Still, it's better than nothing, though I had this nagging feeling the season didn't reach it's full potential. A few more episodes might have done the trick. :)"
4,Guilty pleasure,"This is like a scenario concocted in the mind of a twelve-year-old assigned to a grown man to write, and lest you think that's a bad thing, let me say it's not. Given that this is Lance Horner, you know there's gotta be slaves aplenty, and there is. The plot here concerns a man who goes from being a pampered rich boy to a sex slave, all by the evil schemings of his outcast cousin, who starts out being the prostitute until he turns up with the Master plan (""master"" plan to make his cousin a slave, get it?) to effect a role reversal.The writing is mostly prurience and racial stereotypes. The part of me that's still a twelve-year-old ate it up and enjoyed every minute of it. I kept telling myself this is immature, ridiculously stupid, and offensive, then something in me would respond ""exactly, and that's why you love it.""I'm ashamed, and so will you be too, but man that Lance Horner is one heckuva writer."
3,"If you like cheesy movies with erotic content, this one does","When I watched this one, I was reminded of the cheesy comedy of Flesh Gordon...there's all the token nudity and sexual situations...watching white people try spanish accents is pretty entertaining as well. Don't be looking for fabulous effects on this one, it's just a funny little movie, cheesy humour, erotica, might remind you of zorro the gay blade, just with nudity..."
2,it's just stupid,"it's really bad, I just saw the pictures and thought must be good but it's not. seems to be for children."
1,good example of what NOT to buy,"I purchased this DVD because I am building my Zorro collection. However, the sound quality is equivalent to an amateur learning the basics. The actors/actresses are of the wrong cultural background. Really, blondes talking with a Mexican ""accent"". Too stereotypical. There is no acting whatsoever, just a bunch of ""gringos"" dressed in the old California style moving in front of the camera. This movie is far worse than a ""B"" production. If you are a teenager who has never seen a naked woman, you might get something out of this fiasco production. As for me, I would not spend more than $2.50 on this DVD. I got totally burned."
5,Small size - Big Light,"I have these little lights in all colors. Best flashlight ever!I purchased my first one after having to walk up eight flights of stairs in the dark to get to my apartment during a power outage = have never been without one since! I even have one on my laundry basket when I do laundry in the basement.The red one I use when traveling to read in bed after my partner has gone to sleep (or hasn't gotten up yet). I also wear one to bed (in hotels) incase we have to evacuate unexpectedly.The green and blue ones I wear when walking at night for safety. (Would easily attach to a dog as well).Long lasting, durable, small size, good price. Fun colors."
2,eh,bright at firstturns on in your pocket kills the bat.i like other stuff from these people but not this
3,"great light, but be careful of the clip","This really is a very nice light and worked well for me while I had it. The problem is not the light, but the clip; it simply would not stay on my keychain. It worked itself off my keychain 3 times in the 2+ weeks I owned it, and on the third time it was lost.I don't think the problem was my chain, as I have had various things attached to it over the years with no problems, but this clip simply would not stay on. So go ahead and buy it, but make sure it's securely attached. If I buy another, I will certainly do that."
5,let there be light,"These little lights are a must for everyone. I recently returned home to find the electricity out in my apartment building. Without this little light I would have had to go up 8 flights of stairs in complete darkness. I give them for holiday gifts. They work great on my keychain --- not in the way, but ready when I need them. I also take the red one with me when I travel so I can read in bed without disturbing anyone else in the room."
1,Stupid Comedy,"The best thing about this movie is that it is a comparatively short movie. Maybe I am a bit sullen about it because when I was in high school a boy I knew had a party at his house when his parents were away on vacation, and the kids did so much damage that it made both the national news and the Reader's Digest. Jack, in this movie, was lucky that didn't happen to his house. The only good I can say about this movie is that it could serve as some half-baked warning to teens to not host parties when their parents are away. Beyond that, it uses about every trick in the book to break traditional values of honesty, sexuality, etc."
2,more power to ya,"The sentiments of a 13-year old expressed with 40-plus years of extra credit vocabulary. Solipsist revisited. Whatever you expect out of written word Henry Rollins, you'll find it here. Enjoy! The Kafka quote on the back cover blows the rest of the book out of the water. At least it's acknowledged."
