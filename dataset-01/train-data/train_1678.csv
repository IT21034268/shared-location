3,Kingsbury Collection,This book took me a very long time to read.This book features three different stories and just how God moves in your life.
5,great read,"I enjoyed reading these stories on my kindle, Easy to download, easy to read. I Love my kindle! Love Amazon.com"
3,dark and slow,"Maybe a bad time of year to read this dark, slow series. I didn't enjoy it as much as other KK books."
5,Super Book. It is hard to put down once you start reading it!,You will love this book by Karen Kingsbury. It really makes you appreciate life when things are good and helps you realize the role that prayer and faith play in your life.
5,Incredible Experience!!,"I originally watched this on PBS, and immediately ordered the DVD so I could watch it repeatedly and keep it in my permanent reference library. The filming is stunning, and the concept is incredible ... follow an aquifer underneath fields, cities, roads, pristine woods and trash dumps. For those who have only experienced water resources coming from a tap inside the house, this video dramatically expands consciousness of this miraculous and fragile resource. Seeing ""first-hand"" how groundwater moves, and how the ""terra firma"" literally floats above the aquifer is a rare and awe-inspiring experience."
2,disappointment,I found this book didn't give me the information I needed in a useable format. I also found out I could get the same book for $7 from another source. Made me feel less likely to buy from Amazon in the future.
4,exellent,this is onje of my favorite cd`s this one of best political bands of its time.very politically pissed off an angery...i really like this alblum ..i recomend this to anyone who enjoys good music
2,Only 4 full size logs out of 100 pieces,"We purchased this set because it had 100 pieces and we thought that it would have close to 100 full size logs similar to the set we remembered when we were children. Unfortunately our set had only 4 full size logs and the rest small pieces as connectors. This set was not at all what we expected, and we would not have bought it had we known that it had only 4 logs like the ones we remembered."
2,Very limited - too many small pieces,"I was very disappointed in this set. They advertise many wood pieces, but they don't tell you that most of them (65 or so) are just the small connectors. You can only build very narrow buildings, and you have to leave gaps in most of the walls if you want any kind of height. I found it very difficult to do anything other than what was on the box, and it was even more frustrating for my 4-year-old when he tried to do something new. The 2 roof pieces are tricky too - they must be offset in height to work properly next to each other. Even for only $20, I would not recommend it. Get a set with more of the full-size pieces."
4,What music should be like,This cd is wicked! Nearly every track on the cd is a work of true satanic art. The only two bad tracks are with the gleam of tor and Macarbre operetta- and my friends even like those. I brought this cd yesterday and cant stop listening to it. a must be for any Samael or even Dark Metal fan
4,Great bit of fun if you don't read too much into it,"This is a quick, bouncy book about a group of animals and their morning routine.You can overthink the broccoli stew bit (my nieces think it's really funny to say ""ew"" at broccoli, because they LOVE broccoli - and so do I, but I think having it for breakfast would be a little much!), and you can overthink the rabbit not being tall enough for basketball (what? He *is* too short to play that game!), but once you're done with that you're left with just this - a short, bouncy book that will wake everybody up when you read it at the top of your lungs in the morning to the tune of... well, any tune at all."
1,Surprised,"I do like Boynton's books and have several of them however, I wasn't impressed with this work. Saying ""ew"" to food and telling certain characters that they can't or shouldn't be doing something. Not exactly something I want my child to learn early on that she can't do something because of her size or say ew to food (especially before trying it)."
1,Cookies for breakfast???,"I love Sandra Boynton books. We own almost all of them! But I found this one to be extremely inappropriate. It encourages kids to turn their noses up at broccoli but to ask for cookies and milk for breakfast. Skip this one, but definitely check out her other titles. She generally has great, fun, educational books!"
2,"""EW""'","A little disappointing after reading Barnyard Dance, but a good rhythm none the less. I don't like the ""ew"" in reference to broccoli stew. I guess I'm for encouraging kids to eat their vegetables. Also, the small animals tell large animals to go do big guy things because they're too large. I don't like the implication there either (no, I'm not large)."
2,Horrible condition,"It was in horrible condition. The binding is weak. There is writing on the title page. The book itself is awesome, but I cannot give a good review for a book in horrible condition. If you can find a new one, purchase it."
4,Excellent but obscure cartoons,"I found the Top Ten Forgotten Cartoons to be enjoyable, and a welcome change from the run of the mill cartoon collection. In particular, the Harman-Ising film, ""To Spring"" with it's colorful fantasy scenes and the beutiful music of Edvard Grieg, played on a pipe organ...to be particularly well done.This one film was worth the purchase price alone."
4,Lost classics for a lost afternoon,You want a nice lazy afternoon? This is the one for you. Has the classic 'To Spring' as well as several others that will put a smile on your face.Enjoy!
5,top 10 forgotten cartoons,This is a great cartoon dvd for any child. My son was thrilled to get it because it is not available in stores.I also got very fast service.
3,"""Restored"" is a stretch","The packaging says the cartoons are ""digitally restored."" Well, no, not really. The colors are dim, the lines are fuzzy, and the audio is pretty muffled. It probably plays okay through an older-model tube TV, but on an HDTV, you definitely sense these cartoons were made many decades ago and intended as disposable entertainment. For the price, I found the purchase worthwhile -- it's still enjoyable viewing. Just don't get your hopes up about the quality."
3,Not as expected.....,"The efficiency of the transaction with the seller was fine...I was just disappointed with the content. I watched cartoons on the big screen in the 40' and 50's and am trying to find the ones that were 3D figures (not the kind you need glasses to watch, but more like Ray Harryhausen figures). I am always pleased with my transactions through Amazon!Thanks!"
5,Excellent,"I found this brand thru a dermatoligist visit and have been trying to find them to purchase. Where else to look but Amazon.com? If you have sensitive skin or ""older"" skin, these are great and the price is right."
5,great,these are the best bandaides that i have ever used. and are a lot cheaper than buying them in store. customer service was great.
2,Coverlet Latex Free Adhesive Strips,"Brought a couple of boxes of these Coverlet Latex Free Strips(3""x1"")because of the great reviews. I agree with all of the postings that these are one of the best adhesive strips out on the market as far as sticking, holding, protecting your cuts with great flexibility, however, I'm not quite certain if it's just me but, there must be something in the adhesive which I'm extremely allergic to. I know I'm allergic to latex and, these are latex free so, it can't be related to the latex... once I put these on, I develop a very bad rash which drives me insane with unbearable itching. Not quite certain if I've just developed extremely sensitive skin in my old age but, these itch so bad, I can't help but scratching to the point were I may make myself bleed. I have to remove them and use a different brand, rendering these useless. If it weren't for the rash or itching I develop, I'd definitely give these 5 stars."
5,Very Good Product,I needed a strong bandage for my elbow. This product serves the purpose. The bandage stays on for 4 or 5 days even through showering.
5,Classic Phil Woods' Be-bop at it's best,"Great compositions by Phil, wonderful supporting musicians, and classic be-bop licks make this one of my favorite Phil Woods CD's. The movements are put together like a jazz symphony that works very, very well. Enjoy."
3,Great singing but dreadful production.,"This DVD is widely available at a very cheap price, and I thoroughly recommend it to fans of Rossini. The production, however, is virtually a costumed concert performance, with the chorus on stands at the back and the soloists standing at the front. Singers move around as needed, but there is pretty much no attempt at acting the roles. They all just stand and deliver. Certainly, what they deliver is pretty good. The multi-screen idea is often effective, but all those images of running water must have been problematic for some audience members stuck in their seats for a whole long act at a time! But by all means buy this for some wonderful music beautifully performed."
4,Very good and now available in less expensive edition,This classic opera is now available in a DVD that costs about $20--an excellent buy for a complete and exciting performance of this important work. It is listed under Guglielmo Tell
3,"Great Music, Very Poor Quality DVD","Rossini's Masterpiece Opera, William Tell is four hours of incredible music sung extremely well by the entire cast. However the picture is dark, fuzzy and grainy, not whaat I expect from a DVD. The movie screens behind the singers are a distraction. I give the music a 5, the singing a 5, the orchestra and Muti a 5. The picture a 1 and I am very disappointed that this is only in 2 channel stereo. But this is the only DVD of this opera available at this time and it is well worth buying just to listen to the singers and the glorious music.I wish the Met and Mr. Gelb would be willing to take the opportunity to put this opera on their schedule with a top cast. That I would pay to go to."
3,a respectable comeback for a west coast legend,"playa hamm started out as one half of the underrated group penthouse players clique with tweed cadilac and special guests dj quik and eazy e. now hamm has come back with layin hands. this is a respectable piece of work that, alas, has none of dj quiks production. check out the hypnotizing beat on no prints. classic. for those who miss the clique, look no further. tweed guests on some of the music to allow for a bit of the old school. overall it is worth a spin."
5,Lengendary album worth every penny.,One of the most underatted rappers this album has been slep on. My best tune is track 3 but as i listen to the ablbum other tracks grow on me. I wished playa hamm had made a few more albums
1,Unable to preview,This rating is low becasue I was unable to preview any of the songs. This CD is the only one on the site that can not be previewed.
4,Snapshots of North American History,"This atlas follows a unique format, focusing on the history of North America as a whole, from prehistory to the US Civil War. It follows the same format as other Atlases by the author, C. McEvedy, which cover other regions of the world.I enjoyed following the 'snapshots' of North America throughout history. Each snapshot includes a map of North America at a given year with a narrative discussing the changes shown in the maps. Most of the coverage is of more recent history after the European discovery of America, and is very general in scope. It focuses on population movements, exploration, political developments, and war.Some drawbacks include an excessive focus on the USA/European perspective and the early end date of 1870. Despite this, it was a very enjoyable and interesting read."
5,Great for a friend,I have this poem to my best friend who I've known since we were five and she truly is like mysister. I gave this as part of her gift to say thank you for accepting the honor of being my daughters godmother.
2,Underperformer,"As Steve Hamilton notes, the opus called ""Mr. Mick"" that Stackridge played on stage, and the album released in 1976 are remarkably different.Stackridge disbanded after ""Mr. Mick""'s release, and lay dormant until 1998, when Warren, Walter and Evans reformed the band. After an endearing, smart and hook-filled cd of new material spun out in 1999 titled ""Something About The Weekend"", the band has picked as it's follow-up cd, ""Mr. Mick"", as it was before slamming into the editing block 24 years ago. [Think: Pete Townsend's ""Lifehouse"" project"" and scale down a bit.]Buy this cd to hear some stellar saxwork from Keith Gemmell, some of Andy Davis', ""Crun"" Walter's and ""Mutter"" Slater's best writing ever, and much more. If nothing else, it'll be collectable after the unexpurgated version is released. After all, you'll still think of replacing your ""Who's Next"" after ""Lifehouse"" sees light of day, right?"
4,"Sakamoto at piano, good music, but too brief","This CD consists of Sakamoto playing the music from ""Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence"" on piano, plus a couple of bonus tracks. It's a nice addition to the collection of fans of his film music. However, it should be noted that this CD is on 35 minutes long. Given the possibilities of the CD media, I found this disappointing."
5,Great to do business with,"Thanks for the product, it is exactly as described. The kids love them and they got here very quickly. Thanks"
1,Doesn't Last,"Don't waste your money on this cologne. It smells great, but after 10 minutes it's as if you never splashed it on."
5,US Flag,"Flies proudly in the yard visible from I 90 Montana, especially great during the night with spot light illumination, proud to be an American"
2,Did not last,This flag is fraying after only 18 months. I expected better durability. Guess I'll try Valley Forge and hope for longer useful life.
1,4x6 nylon flag,This is a poor quality flag. It started to fray at the edges the first day it was up. Within a week the grommets were coming out. I woluld not recommend it to anyone.
2,Didn't survive 6 months,"Initially I was quite pleased with the value of this flag. However after six months, it has frayed quite badly. Once the fraying starts, its not long before it needs to be replaced. I had certainly hoped for better."
2,Low Quality,For the price I was a bit disappointed. While this flag would certainly be fine for an occasional display on a holiday etc. for every day use it is not practical. Spend a few extra $$ for a better quality flag for commercial daily use.
5,GREAT,"great quality flag, vibrant colors, really beautiful to see. One summer down and it looks like new. Worth the money!"
3,Great Buy,"These flags were super except for the fact that we had to take them to our local dry cleaner to have new grommets sewn in. The original grommets tore loose from the flag after a short period of use. With the new ones in place, the flag has flown throughout a very blustery winter without any problems."
3,Wheeler Canyon,"Nice flag and the quality seemed good, but it did not last very long. I leave it out all the time but it started to shred on the end before it started to fad. Usually the flags fad before they rip."
1,Misrepresented,"Length:: 0:32 MinsThe flag I received is not the one represented in the picture which implies extra stitching around the edges, heavy duty grommets and embroidered stars. This flag is flimsy and will not hold up. The raving reviews for this product must be for a completely different product? Seems strange that there is such a variation. It makes you wonder if the vendor is pulling two different products from their shelves?12/29/11 An update. After 20 days of outside use this version of old glory tore through one of the grommets and is shot. So I guess that makes it about $1/day for this unit. Worth it for you? If so you should stock up because you'll be goin' through them!Check out the video if you'd like to see for yourself."
1,Only lasted 3 months,"I purchase this flag 3 months ago and had to through it out today. Both grommets broke and the ends are already starting to rip. The flag it replaced lasted 3 years. This one, 3 months."
5,Great High Quality Flag,"The flag came really quick and it looks great on my flag pole in the front yard. I should have gone bigger for a 20' pole because this one just says, ""Hey, I'm an American."" I want one that says, ""Hell yeah! Suck it socialistic neighbors!"""
5,One of my favorite books growing up...,"One of my favorite books growing up was a companion book in this series, called If You Lived in Colonial Times. The illustrations in all of these books is the best! Detailed drawings show what clothes the adults and kids would be wearing. Each page answers a different question like, ""What happened when a child misbehaves?"" Kids can learn a lot from these books. I plan to collect all of them for my children."
4,HARD BOPPIN',"Not as priceless as ROUND MIDNIGHT,MILESTONES is a crossover of things to come for MILES.It is a prime example of hard bop jazz,the way it was played in 1958.DR.JACKYL and SID'S AHEAD are the key numbers here ,allowing all the musicians to shine on their instruments.Alternate versions (STRAIGHT NO CHASER,MILESTONES and especially TWO BASS HIT were unnecessary).They are there to make the record last longer.TRIVIAL QUIZ:who says ALL RIGHT at the end of the second version of STRAIGHT NO CHASER?Who hits harder JO JONES or MAX ROACH?Wifes of the late musicians could tell us."
2,Not Enough Miles,"I found this release to be to saxaphone/Coltrane heavy. There seems to be Coltrane blowing at every moment. I love Coltrane, but I bought this album expecting more of the delicate, intricate work that had been recorded before with the Miles Davis Quintet and I was some-what disappointed. Buy Relaxin' or Workin' instead"
4,Kindly retelling of Anishinabe legends for young readers,"In this book, originally published in 1970, children's author/illustrator Dirk Gringhuis reconstitutes Chippewa myths from the Mackinac Island and Sault Ste. Marie regions, many originally collected by folklorist Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, into a volume of nineteen stories suitable for older children and young teenage readers. The myths are told in a way that is suitable for families of almost all beliefs. The overall tone of these retellings is gentle, and it lacks some of the grimness that marked these stories as they were originally told. One key theme of these retellings, repeated over and over, is that of the metamorphosis or transformation of the souls of key human characters into a new dimension or state of being."
5,Glad to find all these cuts on CD!,"We replayed our videotape of Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics at my house over and over this year and last. Finding all the songs in the special, plus extra cuts like ""Lonely Jew At Christmas"" from the original Mr. Hankey episode, on one CD is a real find. I can't wait for it to arrive.If you're easily offended, overly religious, and priggishly preachy, you don't have any business hanging out in this ""quiet mountain town"" (or passing judgment on its musical offerings); but if you have a sense of humor, particularly a bawdy one, you're gonna love the stuff on this CD. Parker and Stone are geniuses, albeit in the rough -- but much of the music they've created shows the brilliant facets glittering through all the fart jokes."
4,Hilarious Toilet Humor from the Toilet King - Mr. Hankey,"Some people find this one over the top. Well isn't that thepoint of South Park in the first place? Not one to share with all yourfriends (and especially parents) but truly enjoyable with those in the ""know"" for those Bah-Humbuggers out there - ""Dead, Dead, Dead"" is a true treat. And figuring out the lyrics to ""The Most Offensive Song Ever"" will keep that jingle roaming around joyously in your head for days. It's got a few downers ""Swiss Colony Beef Log"" being the most unnotable. But, highly enjoyable if your idea of fun is ""toilet humor"" - Mr. Hankey the best toilet humor ever! END"
4,Mr. Hankey and Christmas.......A perfect combination,"This is ""THEE"" Christmas CD to own this holiday season ! With song's like: Mr.Hankey the christmas poo...The Lonely Jew on Christmas..and Swiss Colony Beef Log..you can't go wrong !There are afew stinkers here, but not enough to ruin this soon to be classic...so do yourself a favor and buy this tape...don't let Mr.Hankey slip through your hand's this Christmas."
3,Good but not great,"Many of the songs on this album are hilarious, (Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo, The Lonely Jew on Christmas, Dreidel Dreidel Dreiel)but many are also completely unfunny (Dead Dead Dead, What the hell child is this, it happened in sun valley etc...). All in all, I guess you should buy this CD if you are a South Park fan, but if you are not, then you probably won't care for it."
3,ONE MISSING SONG!,"As all South Park viewers know, on the Christmas show Santa and Jesus did a duet(her name is Rio and ....). Well a lump of coal to Trey and Matt, cuz that song t'aint here. Other than that, fans won't be disappointed. Non-fans however, use your best discretion."
5,Not For The Easily Offended,"This CD is hilarious, i admit there are some songs that aren't really funny, but theres always 1 or 2 bad songs on an album (in this one, the 1 bad track is ""It happened in sun valley"" that was a REALLY bad song). Also if you are easily offended by swearing, raciest remarks (don't worry its always in the interest of humor and always is funny) so if you are so devoted to you religion that you would defend it in any way then don't buy this. But if you like south park or are getting sick of the normal Christmas songs then BUY THIS ALBUM"
4,a must have for south parkeans,"although i thought the chef aid was better, this was an awesome cd. complete with holiday cheer and not so peacefulness this cd was absoulutley hilarious. a must have fo south park fans."
3,I like this CD,"This is hilarious as well as obnoxious. I have the first two South Park Albums and this one has to be the best. I like the song "" Christmas Time in Hell"". But I don't like the first song, because its disgusting. But the rest of the songs are pretty funny"
4,Very Short,"It wasn't exactly what I thought it would be, I love Chef Aid, but this cd is a bit short, ranging some songs from 30 seconds to 4 minutes... I would say for you to only buy this cd if you are a true fan of it. It was an ok cd, but there are better ones out there... Maybe its because I have to listen to it a second time, or I need to get in the christmas spirit... but it did not live up to my expectations, thank you."
4,Disturbing satisfaction--,"Particularly in these (justifiably) paranoid times, the Illuminatus! trilogy is an appropriate read. The anthrax scare and the little-known island of Fernando Poo are just on the edge of being too close to home. I wouldn't know where to begin to explain the plot, but it's something about Eris, something about government, and something about enlightenment.While reading 805 pages of conspiracy theory is certainly a fine way to immerse yourself in the world of the authors, I have to say that all three books in one volume can be just a little bit too much of a good thing."
2,"Worth about 10 pages of ""Gravity's Rainbow""","A mildly entertaining work, despite overall structural incoherence. Weird, trippy, and often hysterical, but ultimately worth about ten pages of Pynchon's ""Gravity's Rainbow"". For more fast-paced, stylish, coherent Illuminati action, check out Grant Morrison's ""Invisibles"" comic book series (4 out of 5 stars in that particular genre)."
2,Huh?,"I guess I just don't get it. This book has it's moments, but they're stuck in between the stream of conciousness style narrative that runs through the whole book. I had high hopes, now I just want to finish it and hope EVERYONE gets killed! I think that it could have been written in about half the pages and not lost anything. 2 stars is being generous. This one is definitely going to the used book store!"
1,"Just because it's confusing, doesn't mean it's deep.",Absolutely dreadful book. All the worse because the first hundred pages are so funny. But after that it is pure dreck. The book actually contains a terrible review of itself written into the text. Surely it was meant as a joke (or perhaps an excuse) but it's far closer to the truth. Don't be fooled by this books books cult status. Avoid it.
1,All that need be said,"One doesn't really need to read this trilogy (though I have) to get an insight into ""what it's all about"".Yes, it's true that one of the lead characters is noted for the admonition ""Think for yourself, schmuck!"", and I have seen this admonition repeated several times in this forum.But the people in this forum who say, ""Think for yourself, schmuck!"" are adoring fans of this book and they are responding to the minority who don't like the book at all.The fans of the book appear to have decided that one couldn't possibly be thinking for himself if he just plain doesn't like the book.In other words, ""Think for yourself, schmuck!"" is just a code phrase for ""Think like I do! Think like the majority of us do!""And that by itself, I think, is all that one really needs to know about the content of the book, the authors and the audience to whom the book is directed."
2,"Juvenile, Turgid, Dated, and Not Worth The Time","This re-read didn't hold up.Of course, I first read this in the late '70s and was wowed...but as pop culture has moved on this work's paranoia seems dated, quaint, and juvenile. The narrative itself is confused and turgid...with changing perspectives, ideological bloat-ware, clumsy sentences, and little appreciation for the uninitiated reader.If you are a student of '60s counter-culture/pop culture and fascinated by some dated conspiracy theories then you may find some value in this book. This work also, partly, inspired Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum....a fine piece of literary fiction from the Italian Semiotician.General Recommendation: Don't wast your money."
5,Even false reviews are true,"I brought this book and a plethora of other books with me on a family road trip. End result I read all of The Illuminatus! Trilogy and pretty much ignored my other books. If I had to use one world to describe this book it would be mindf**k. A Midget, dolphins, JFK, a parody of Ayn Rand, a pimp, a crazed anarchist billionaire of the sea, conspiracies, Jesus Christ, John Dillinger, Libertarian women who know what they want, religious fundamentalists that would make Jerry Falwell blush, and even Satan. Its got all this and a bag of Fnord.Buy this book down or else you will feel the wrath of the 3 eyed ones."
1,Awful,"I picked up this book a couple of years ago while in search of literature on the secret Illuminati society, which according to legend, has run the world behind the scenes for centuries. Well, it was one of those few books which I could not even read. It was so trashy and sporadic in the first hundred pages that I tossed it aside. No doubt cult fans will be as mad at me as I would be if someone insulted ""Star Wars,"" but in my humble opinion, this is shlock literature of the highest sort."
2,Inspired but still hackwork,"There is almost no point to this book; the philosophical ideas the authors try to illustrate are lost in the shuffle and have to be explained in the 22 appendices. Some credit must be given for them managing to work in references to Lovecraft, Fort, Rand, Hamilton, Stirner and Coolidge, and the parody of Atlas Shrugged is cute. If the authors don't like the fact that every page of Rand's fiction is filled with her worldview, surely their unintelligible is much worse."
5,THIS IS CRITICAL,"Okay. The best point in the development of your psyche at which to read this book is a dangerous time for modern mind. Homo Sapiens Sapiens can either be seduced by the Fountainhead well of teenage bitch idolatry or the marvelously uncreatively constructed John Gault, hero of Atlas Shrugged. Rather than falling in love with the prince charming to J.A.P.s, its best to learn to rely on yourself in a confusing world in a more constructive way than by being guilted into trying to take it over, because maybe you could if you became something...that...doesn't resemble any person that ever lived nor any person that ever will without extensive genetic clipping and splicing. or whatever it is we will have to become to survive when there are warhead equipped robotic sharks in our bays and and we take fallout in our coffee. Eschaton. Hail."
5,Masterpiece.,"Absolutely wonderful book, a work of a true genius. Intelligent, funny, deep, political, philosophical, sexy, profound, you name it. It definately pushed the right buttons for me. Although I rarely have the nerve to read long books, after a hundred pages of this one I was sad because it has ""only"" 800+ pages. Probably the best book I ever read. And I read a few.A must for anyone interested in: culture of the 60s, conspiracies, the movement of '68, psychology, magic, radical left-wing politics, everything..."
3,Not a pompous review!,"This is a book that you'll either love or hate... I read this around 1977(?), at the time there were about four of us reading it and it provided a great deal of conversation fodder. It's childish/brilliant in its attempt to tie every conspiracy together in a big sex/drugs/and rock n roll gumbo. Of course, now it seems very dated and silly. Or is it? I do thank Shea and Wilson for indtroducing a lot of folks to the idea that all is not what it seems (fnord) but I think the REAL truth is much more scary."
2,I had no idea what I was reading,"Was this book written by one person? It didn't make any sense, the writing styles kept on changing, and there was no plot or consistency. Maybe I missed the point of the book entirely, but after 30 pages I threw it out."
4,"Nice and Long, Big and Strong","Go RAW, Hail Kalisti, And Bring The Illuminatus Primuses to LifeI have found my golden AppleAnd She Fed it to meWith renewed Poweri sit on a golden appel sea"
2,Can't seem to get started on it,"Perhaps it picks up later, but I'm finding the book extremely dull through page 60. Has it aged past its time, I wonder?"
3,"really good book but I mean cmon, sex with apples?","Okay, this book was great, I loved it. But I also agree with another review someone wrote that also thought all the 'sex detours' were a bit much and got very annoying and pointless. Despite that, the book is great. If you're very closeminded and take everything seriously then this might not be the book for you. Its not really that confusing of a read."
2,Sorry.....,"I never took acid so I just don't get it. I so wanted to enjoy this book. Plowing thru the intentionally poor prose and grammer. Trying to laugh at the witty, inside jokes. The story held me for about the first 400 pages, ... The last half of Leviathan was absolutely brutal with the worst run on sentences and longest paragraphs I have ever seen.I was so disappointed in the ending. ...As an update, I finally finished the Wilson's best work ""The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles"" and since there is no book 4 yet, I'm going to give this one another read to help fill in the gaps. ***2007 Update...watch us in peace RAW, your books have inspired me to new intellectual heights. Heights my first grade teacher Sister Mary would never have dreamed of. I plan on reading this book again now that I've got about 8 more of your works under my belt. I think I get it now. Thank you.***"
5,Great book,"For how cheap the book was, I was amazed in how great the condition it was in. Thank you again!"
2,Lightweight,"Neither Pynchon, Gass, Gaddis, Barth nor DeLillo have any reason to feel threatened. This is lightweight material. For people who want to think they've worked for their fiction without actually having to put any thought into the project. The book is not exactly bad, but it is grossly lacking the mind-numbing agility writers like Gaddis have been practicing for some time. Whether by his intention, the publishing house's design, or simply misinformed, misguided, spoon-fed word-of-mouth, Shea is a pretender to the throne."
5,I Love RAW,Robert Anton Wilson is an amazing man. This book is a self contained manual to deprogram yourself from society. Buy it.
1,Waste of my reality,"This has to be one of the worst books that I have ever read, or, at least according to the number of better reviews posted, I just don't get IT, whatever IT is supposed to be. Obviously, the writers are just so caught up in their own reality that we lesser humans are sentenced to wasted time trying to grasp what the IT is that the authors so obscurely put forth other than that tripping is a mind opening experience. Like, Wow man, what's the story about anyway - that's the joke, there isn't one.The only benefit of this book is that it acts as a sleep aid. Readers, if you want great science fiction, go read Cryptonomicon; which comparably is one of the best books that I have ever read."
1,The only book I never finished,"Why cant O pick zero stars? This was less entertaining than the cereal box - and I havent eaten cereal since I was 12...From the cover and the write-ups on this, I thought this would be right up my alley - quirky / funny / etertaining / etc...After 100 pages I stopped reading - that may not mean much if you dont know me, but I NEVER stop reading. Same thing I do with movies, I ALWAYS see them through to the end. I guess I always figure there could be something at the end to tie it all up, or make it all worthwhile. Seldom happens though (Brown Bunny) but I still keep at it. But not with this nonsensical piece of rubbish.If there was a clear idea or thought stream, I didnt hang around long enough to find out. Think of this as Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas in book form - if that movie was your cup of tea, you might dig it, and I might just be the straight square not willing to drop acid to see the lights ;-)"
1,Avoid by all means!,"Okay, let's take some steampunk, some Da Vinci Code, some Percy Jackson, some vampire and Atlantis lore and water it down with some 9/11 paranoia. Hand it out to the some adolescents and have them write some plots based upon this. Then take those plots, smoke some pot, invent some corny lingo like 'fnord' and then begin cutting and pasting like hell so you don't get sued by Rowling, Dan Brown, Stieg Larsen, Neil Gaiman, Stephanie Meyer, Anne Rice or whoever. Might just be the ghost of Plato for all I care - and you got yourself a book, gentlemen. Okay, let's publish it! Okay, we haven't proof red it or anything, but who cares, we just got to laundry som money.That's at least my impression of this totally crappy book.That someone even finds this even half entertaining is beyond me, because it's so utterly awful! Do avoid this with all means, and get some good old Sherlock Holmes instead."
5,Illuminism explained. . . or something.,Advice to anyone who wants to know anything at all about the Illuminati and other secret conspiracies to rule to world: read this book.Then you might have a slight handle on basic theories and the insane conplexities of the five-fold Them.
3,"Silly conspiracy tour, but entertaining","I read this book long ago. It's even crazier than I remember it! Very tongue-in-cheek, but makes fun with a sense of equality"
2,Elsewhere,"A great example of how size and complexity do not equal depth or worth, this large, culty trilogy is more or less a white-noise barrage of meaningless events splattered over a thousand or so pages. As a proper novel it's a big shaggy-dog story, and as a reading experience it's just not interesting enough. By the end I was reading it as a grudge, just to prove that I could do it.It's dated, too - the female character(s) are/is there for the men to have sex with - and the time- and space-hopping narrative isn't nearly as clever as it seems to think. It has some memorably smug characters, too, and the air of something dreamed up and written down one night whilst bored."
1,"great book, poor kindle version","How many times did I read George Dora? Or miss a line from one page to the next? Or get dashes in the middle of a line? Truly great book, appalling (and expensive) Kindle version. Buck up your game, publishers!"
1,I Really Tried To Read It ...,"I know that a lot of people have loved this series and have come away from this series with ideas that have become a part of them. So I really wanted to read and enjoy these books. But my brain can't follow 20 shifting characters and constant point-of-view shifts even within the same character. I'm sure that the story is brilliant. But I just couldn't manage to keep all the stories and people straight. I finally gave up altogether with the reading. These books will definitely challenge you, but they're not for everyone."
5,A Literary Acid-Trip Through Multiple Dimensions!,"The Illuminatus Trilogy bombards your conscious mind with conspiritorial, illuminating, and downright perplexing theories of the Universe in order to break on through to the sub-conscious. Every page causes you to question everything, including what you have just read. If you don't look at Reality in a new light after reading this book, then your just not trying hard enough"
5,Filled with sex and violence,in and out of time and space--the three books of The Illuminatusare only partly works of the imagination. They tackle all the coverups of our time--from whoreally shot the Kennedys to why there's a pyramid on a one-dollar bill.
5,The only Scripture capable of making a Pope in under an hour,"Reveals the Law of Fives-- the more we study it the more we see its effects. Asks what is the difference between an ""actual"" Emporer and one who is just treated as Emporer and presents us with the shattered myths of Emporer Norton I. Chaos as blind luck vs Justice as blind order..."
1,a mess,"Some inventive concepts, trapped in the 70's, did NOT age well. I slogged through it, felt like I was not rewarded in the end. A lot of the reviews I have read say things like, ""if you don't like this book, you are not well read [or smart]."" I think those things are said to justify liking what is essentially a mess of a book."
4,Reflections of The Dream of Spaceflight,Not what I expected. This is a philosophical rather than a technical book. It is very well written and quite enjoyable.It has an engaging literary style.
3,Warm Tuna,"I hadn't heard anything from Jorma Kaukonen or his old band Hot Tuna in years, so when I saw this on special I snapped it up. Do you know what? His distinctive, bluesy voice is eerily as it was on Hot Tuna's first album thirty-some years ago and ditto for his picking style. The best songs on this album are those written by others: True Religion, How Long Blues, Death Don't Have No Mercy, and I Know You Rider. Three of those were on the first Hot Tuna album but better done there. The best Kaukonen-penned tune is I See The Light. The album closes with a lame rendition of the Grateful Dead's Friend of the Devil. Jerry Garcia is spinning in his grave! Overall, I like this CD but if you already own Hot Tuna's first album, there is no real reason to own this one. The arrangements here, though enjoyable, don't really measure up to the originals. Maybe he should rename this album Warm Tuna."
3,not a good fit,I ended up returning it for improper fit other than that the shirt was well made and very good material
5,A Great Book For A Great Star,"This book is full of vital information about one of Hollywood's overlooked stars. It is well researched and written without pandering to the more sensational aspects of the subject's life. This is a thoughtful, yet unbiased, account of a talented man."
5,An Engaging Work,"Fans of Ramon Novarro will love this book. Quite simply, it describes, in great detail, the career of the silent film star. It touches on his personal affairs; however, those looking for intimate details and confirmed accounts of those affairs will be disappointed to know that Mr. Soares does not base this book on speculations. Again, the rumors are addressed but not presented as facts. The reader will learn a lot about the late actor but it leaves the strong sense of mystery surrounding his personal life. Personally, I beleive that's for the best."
3,Good book for beginners,Good introduction for beginners or those considering the sport. Explains many of the mysteries of TKD that have the uninitiated scratching their heads. Very reassuring.
2,guide for Mcdojangs.,"This book is helpful for beginners in Tae Kwon Do, It gives you a brief base on Tae Kwon Do in a way. It is not a book I recommend for Advance Tae Kwon Do Practitioners, people who have been doing TKD for a long time will find this book useless, I almost found this book offensive in a way that it portrayed TKD, and the fact that this books seems to base its validity on the accomplishments of Keith Yates who is a ""10th Degree"" black belt, regardless of the fact that no respectable TKD organization has a higher degree than 9th (and has very few ninth degrees at that). In my Honest opinion its just another person trying to profit off of the American Mcdojang."
3,For Pre-beginners Only,"I bought this book shortly after my first promotion, and quickly realized it was not going to help me move forward. The book seems to be intent on exposing people who may be thinking about studying martial arts to ""the world of Tae Kwon Do"", and it does this just fine. However, if you're looking for ways to learn or improve your techniques, you will need to look elsewhere."
4,For beginners,I guess I thought the book was going to be more than it was. It was very comprehensive and I wanted more detail on the forms. I did learn that one of the authors (yates) has written a book just on the forms. I will be buying that.
2,For someone who isn't sure whether they want to take TKD,"I was a little disappointed in this book. I have been practicing Taekwondo for the past 3 weeks. I was hoping to get some information on forms and some more technical aspects, in order to advance in the class. Instead this book sounded like it was for someone who never took a class before in their life, and was not sure if they wanted to start. Although I am no expert, the book seemed to focus on just explaining how wonderful Taekwondo is, and some other basic information. Also, I found it focused too much on Taekwondo as a sport instead of an artform. As the title suggests, it really did seem a like the perfect guide for an idiot."
5,funny and smart and true.,"I love this book -- not only is it funny and totally nails the 11-year-old boy experience, it is also in a format (concrete poetry) that is user-friendly and may well encourage readers to write concrete poems of their own.I gave away my copy and now need to buy another one!"
3,Recommended for grades 5-6,"A little young for my 7th graders. I was hoping for a few more poems with literary elements I could teach. This book is a little young, but the pictures and the imaginative format will make it a good ""library"" choice. Unfortunately, there isn't anything I could use here for lesson plans."
4,Useful stuff for today's world,"I was amazed at how valuable the concepts presented in this book are! The authors draw on extensive experience helping people in all variety of careers find and get new jobs. Most impressive was the attention to pursuing your individual calling, the way of making a living that matches your interests, skills, and talents. This is a very readable book and the advice is all very practical. I recommend it highly."
4,Live Jazz Is the Best Jazz,"First, contrary to popular belief, ""Oleo"" is not a blues. Second, if you don't like hearing this band play live (and fast), you might want to consider listening to music which is not jazz. Never mind the sound quality, this is the hippest band ever, stretching out as only they could. No spiritualism, no endless vamps, just plenty of chord changes and the best bebop around."
3,Miles Away...,"When this release was hyped I thought it would be a great set with a great band featuring Miles, John Coltrane and Canonball, but alas I am very dissappointed. Miles comes across on the first few minutes of the first track and then it seems that his mike goes bad and we are forced to listen to the rest of the show with Miles playing like he's 20 feet from the stage ! That being said, the playing of John Coltrane and Canonball are great. If you are thinking about purchasing this your money would be better spent on other Miles Davis recordings. Columbia should be ashamed of themselves for releasing a recording with this poor quality."
1,BEWARE-PACKING IS BAD ARIVES BENT AND BROKEN,"Nice looking Cage IF you could actually get it non bent and broken.This was the 1st of 3 cages so far to arrive bent and broken,The packing is real bad so when it arrives it is junk and unusable.This was the 1st,Then I got another one,Same Manufacturers as this cage,Both of those, same thing again,Bent and Broken.All if them sold by amazon as a seller.Amazon is now Looking into it removed the other cage from there listing,But not this one,So I thought I should warn the Unsuspecting people that my get there hopes up about this cage.unless Amazon packs this one different as well it will always arrive bent and broken Just like all 3 of mine did.Im now waiting till next week,for them to get there investigation done,so they can pack it better and Hopefully FINALLY get my cage Unbroken!! Here is a link to the other cage-http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006G5IC8/ref=oss_product"
4,very comfy shoe,"I got these because another reviewer said they were the most comfortable shoe she has ever had, and they are, but because of the rubber mesh like lining,they take forever to dry if you get them wet while wearing them which make them hard to walk in. These are great if you dont get them wet."
5,Amazing,These are by far the most comfortable pair of shoes that I own! I wish that I could find them in more colors. You won't regret purchasing these.
5,love them,"I love these thongs. I purchased my 1st pair at the beginning of the summer. I wanted another pair because I can walk forever and never have a sore lower back. I went back to the store where I purchased them and they didnt have anymore in my size. I thought I'd try online and sure enough I found them on amazon.com. I purchased them, recieved them and love them!thank you"
2,mitre box,"While this mitre box is fine, I specifically ordered it to replace a black mitre box I had borrowed. I received a yellow one instead which is what I could have picked up at any local hardware store minus the shipping cost."
2,A good post war film and a poor DVD,"This is a pretty good movie concerning what a young woman has to do do survive right after the fall of Berlin in a Russian and U.S. occupied city. This was made in the 1950's so there was a great deal that couldn't be shown at the time but they conveyed what they could and you do get a good idea of what she and others like her went through. The performances are quite good and there is a great touch of humanity at the end.20TH Century Fox released a flat, pan and scan DVD!!! This is unforgivable and inexcusable at a time when very other studio such as MGM, Warner Brothers and Columbia are releasing their older wide screen movies in wide screen. You're missing over one third of the picture. Also, the pressing isn't that good and, if that weren't bad enough, in a couple of scenes the picture isn't unsqeezed enough and people look a little too thin and a little too tall. This is a good film but a poor DVD."
2,Excellent film;very poor quality DVD,"This is not a good start to the new Fox MOD series.This is a very shoddy presentation of a really interesting film.The film has many interesting points showing the after effects of war.The leads Dana Wynter and Mel Ferrer are excellent and there is a verygood supporting role for groundbreaking Black actor James Edwards.Sadly the DVD is ""full screen"" not scope and extremely grainy to boot!I note that other scope films in the first wave from this series are notedas being ""full screen"" Because of this I will not be buying THREEBRAVE MEN and INTENT TO KILL.Surely Fox cannot be releasing further DVDs of Cinemascope films in thisghastly format!My advice buy if you are desperate to see the film,otherwiseavoid!"
1,Unbelievable how low MOD has sunk,"The only thing that differentiates this print from something you'd find on the Fox Movie Channel is the absence of the station logo on the bottom of the screen every thirty minutes.What on earth are these distributors thinking? On half of these new Fox MOD issues, the initial drum roll of the Fox logo is snipped, so you come in at the middle of it.The studio that virtually INVENTED widescreen (remember Fox Grandeur?) is distributing films in P&S...; Horrifying.And, as is the case with all MOD releases, the cover art is from hunger."
2,Over priced hunk-o-junk,"I bought one of these two years ago, seduced by the bright orange color. I paid locally retail about $50 thinking that if it was brass it must be good quality. Almost immediately I had to contend with inconsistent flow (I would set the end points for my odd shaped yard only to find that the next time I turned it on I would have to readjust it all over again). Sometimes it would get stuck at one end and not come back, but I would manage to get it working again. Finally after a long winter it was time for its third season...after 10 minutes fiddling trying to get it working properly for more than one cycle I realized it was dead and not going to oscillate any longer. Into the recycle bins it goes!"
1,"bought multiples, will cease and desist","I loved the heft, quality, and OK, the bright colors of this sprinkler. I bought my first at a high end nursery. It stopped working, flopping to one side and staying there. I took it back and got another, same thing. I bought another the next year. That one also did not work.Was it me? Did I abuse them in some way? I don't think so, they sat in my vegetable garden and were expected to water in the morning. They weren't even moved around! I found a cheap one in the basement that worked perfectly. Bought another $5 sprinkler and it worked fine.It's so not me."
5,Best overhead sprinkler I've ever used,"I found the first one at a garage sale for a dollar. It looked well made so I decided to splurge and buy it. It turned out to be the best overhead type sprinkler I've ever tried, outlasting half a dozen cheaper units by Melnor, Rainbird and others. I'm buying another one right now at Amazon since nobody carries them locally. Very high quality sprinkler!"
1,It lasted 11 months,"After 11 months of operation, the brass hose connector broke off. The plastic collar that supports this bracket snapped. The local retailer no longer carrys Dramm due to poor quality and poor customer support"
5,Premium Sprinkler,This is a high quality sprinkler at an excellent price. Covers a large area. Was shipped promptly. Very good deal.
5,Sprinkler,"In the summer of 2011 I found this type of Dramm sprinkler in a local store and called the company to find out about it's warranty which is life time free replacement,so decided I would buy one,it worked so much better then other sprinklers I've owned that I decided to buy two more which I did through Amazon now because of the way these sprinklers work when I have all 3 of them on they still cover about equal areas of the yard and I don't have to move them as often to cover the same areas of other plastic leaky one's I've bought in the past.I believe they are well worth the money.Dramm is located and built in Manitowoc Wisconsin and specializes in lawn care products commercial and residential."
4,Dramm Sprinkler,"So far the sprinkler performs satisfactorily. Hopefully, it will not break down as many other brand sprinklers have in the past."
3,Different from other WBCN recordings,"This CD is a good collection of new music recorded live in concert settings.It does not have the diversified or acoustic ""in the studio"" flavor of past WBCN releases.Good if you like the genre of harder alternative music. Not too good if you are looking for one of those good acoustic recordings of the artists' works."
3,Not as good as Naked 1 and 2,"I guess I'm getting old, but I don't like the songs on this disk as much as I like the acoustic numbers on Naked 1 and 2.On the other hand: ""It's Too Late"" by The Jim Carroll Band is worth the price of the entire CD. It's a live cut and pretty rare, I think. Buy it if you can get a good price on it. I got one used in new condition for a few dollars plus shipping. You can't argue with that!"
5,HOTT!!!!!!!!!,THIS BOOK WAS SO ENTERTAINING I READ IT BACK TO BACK TWICE!!!!!!!! ANYONE LOOKING FOR A GREAT READ THIS IS UR BOOK!!!! THUG LOVING AND HUSTLING OUT OF CONTROL!! THE STORY LINE HERE IS SO WELL PUT TOGETHER THAT U WOULD THINK THIS WAS A TRUE STORY! REAL TALK!!!!!!
1,not a good value for the money,"More of a toy than a bike. Training wheels clearly say ""do not remove."" Returning this. Fortunately Amazon's return policy is awesome. Thank you Amazon. Ordered a different item to replace this from you."
1,poor design,Difficult to control since the kids are pedaling and steering the front tire. I recommend a chain-driven bike. This lasted a few rides and he went back to his old bike. Cheap enough though that we didn't mind. Cute Diego design - not well made.
2,OK to poor but prompt,"I received this 3 piece mobile phone kit very quickly. The car charger works just fine but the earpiece was fairly low quality. I could hear fine, but my friends told me they could barely hear me. Once I unplugged the headset, they could hear me just fine. So I'm ok with the charger but not he headset. The cover doesn't fit on my clamshell phone but that's not why I bought the kit."
3,Its ok for the price,"You really cant beat the price of this package. The only negative thing I can say about it is with the belt clip on the phone case. The material is coming off of the belt clip itself, so the metal is exposed on the clip which makes it difficult to slide onto a belt."
4,Excellent and Informative,As always this series continues to offer very good information in regards to how to find climbing routes and the pro that is required on the routes. Gives excellent in depth information as to how to get to the specific climbing areas and even what is available for camping/nightlife etc in the surrounding areas. A big plus to have.
4,Realistic Pre-Code,"Heroes for Sale is one of the few films from classic Hollywood that showed the dark side of the Depression. Thanks to the production code and the desire for escapist films, few realistic portrayals of the Depression were made, but this film in the Forbidden Hollywood series does just that. It is about a man (Richard Barthelmess) who fought in WWI, had a hard time adjusting to life when he got home thanks to a morphine addiction, and found himself going through the ups (marriage and a child) and downs (being labeled a ""Red"" and serving time) of life.Even though the story sounds gloomy, there is an underlying hint of optimism, that the human race can never be beaten. It is a powerful film.It boasts a great cast too. The wonderful Barthelmess, beautiful Loretta Young, and snappy Aline MacMahone grace yet another pre-code.Leonard Maltin introduces this film as one of the shining stars of the pre-code era."
2,Horribly designed control unit,"The feeder itself is an ok concept, but the control unit is awful. As an engineer/programmer, it is obvious to me that an idiot wrote the logic for the control unit. There are so many ways that will bring the unit into a bad state. There have been too many times when I come home, and all the contents of the feeder are completely on the outside of the unit. I had to clean up the mess and scoop it back into the container. Hopefully they have improved the control unit by now, but otherwise, I wouldn't waste $100 on this unit.And also, the container is not air tight, so I have had ants swarming inside the container and I had to throw out all the food to get rid of them."
4,As good as always,Another fine album from one of the best Albion line ups. Don't miss out on this one.
1,Brodeur scared the public about a non-existent risk,"Brodeur is a powerful writer, and his book launched a series of investigations of possible effects of magnetic fields from power lines. In the last couple of years, the verdict is in: power lines do not have a detectable health effect. Brodeur was wrong. Brodeur caused authorities in several countries to waste enormous amounts of money: estimates range from hundreds of millions of dollars to the billions. He's a scaremonger. John W. Farley Professor of Physics University of Nevada, Las Vegas"
5,RATAN FOURNITURE,WORKS GREAT WAS VERY SURPRISE. HAD SOME KIND OF ANTS OR CARPENTER ANTS IN MY RATAN FOURNITURE AND THEY ARE ALL GONE. WILL BY MORE FOR SURE
2,Symptom treatment,"If you have carpenter ants, call someone to attack the nest. This spray was good for killing the carpenter ants I could see but the ants easily navigate around it. I am glad we called a professional who located the nest."
2,This is not molten chocolate cake,"Betty Crocker Warm Delights, Molten Chocolate Cake is pretty good but despite the name, it's not molten chocolate or molten lava cake. Basically, in the package you get chocolate cake mix and a package of fudge. You have to mix the cake mix and water together then squeeze the fudge over the batter then you heat in the microwave for one minute and fifteen seconds. Once it's ready, all you have is chocolate cake with hot fudge on top, NOT molten chocolate cake. Those familiar with this kind of cake know that it's chocolate cake with hot fudge on the inside. If that's what you're looking for, the Betty Crocker Warm Delights, Molten Chocolate Cake isn't it."
3,Can work but not easily!,"These are good for tough projects that can take a pounding. Not very useful for more delicate projects. You really need to hammer these in, so that they can bite. I'll keep em' but they are definitly only for rough projects"
4,yes,"One of the best christian hardcore bands EVER. This cd is so heavy it hurts. The production of both the guitars and the vocals is deep, thick and way too powerful than a cd should be. There is so much mosh on this cd, its unbelievable. This cd should not be missed."
2,All technical and lacks insight,"I have been reading this commentary and I would probably enjoy it if I did not have to skip over the tons and tons of Hebrew words. I still find it to be alright and it helps me understand the translations. I also don't like that he denies the veracity of scripture for this book, and therefore the commentary lacks proper in my opinion context."
5,Very pleased,"I'm very happy with the product, was sealed and received it very fast, will definite order again when I need this product again."
5,Door Lift,The company sent the product on time and it arrived a little ahead of date scheduled. I recommend if anyone looking for this type of product check Killer Tools Company.
3,The Greek gods,I read this book to help me with a report about the Greek Gods and Godesses. It was very informational and it helped me alot with my report If you were looking for pleasure reading about the Gods than you may or may not want this book. It was very good.
1,This book has not stood up to the test of time,"Every now and then I take out this book just to laugh at, and then pity the poor animals who may have suffered for the advice dispensed within the pages. For example, Mr. Pronek suggests that in order to ""get your shell back from the crab"" to simply ""put him in the cold for a short time until he becomes dormant, then simply pull him out of the shell. When he wakes up, have a new shell for him."" A photo of a crab in a ice tray is next to the text. This unusually cruel info is later contradicted, when he states that hermit crabs easily freeze to death because they are tropical animals.The really only good thing I can say about this book is that there are some nice pictures and photos. However, if you're trying to find a good book on hermit crabs, especially the various land species that are sold most commonly, I do suggest you try to find a book that was published more recently than 1982."
1,Unless you plan to kill your hermit crab,"don't buy this book. This book is WOEFULLY outdated and shockingly inaccurate. Some of the suggestions in this book are nothing short of abuse. There are far better sources available today for proper care of your pet land hermit crab, most of them are available online and for free."
2,Could be much better,"It is because of textbooks such as this one that students lose interest in chemistry, and, worse, science in general. Yes, it is filled with LOTS of information, but there are many instances in which otherwise relatively simple concepts are twisted into something incomprehensible. In some cases, it seemed that the authors went out of their way to explain a topic in the most convoluted manner possible. Come on guys, chemistry is complex enough as it is, so rather than write a tome displaying how much YOU know about the topic, how about a more ""student friendly"" textbook that doesn't so readily confirm most people's suspicians that chemistry is as dry as saw dust."
2,Not clear enough,"This book was used in my freshman college chem class. Everyone hated it, including our instructor. I found myself doing a lot of independent study this year, because my instructor was often incomprehensible, and unfortunately, this book most often was just not thorough enough when it came to explanations. Usually, the problems that were explained stepwise, were very simple, so harder problems were difficult to figure out by myself. I am a straight A student, and a pre-med bio major, so I don't consider myself completely stupid, but this book sometimes made me feel as though I was reading a foreign language. Maybe having a better instructor would have made a difference, but since I had to pretty much cover 75% of the course on my own, I had real difficulty understanding the text. On the plus side, the text does cover all the topics required in a college level chemistry course for biology majors."
3,Condition not as expected,"The seller stated that the book wasnt in new condition and had a few imperfections. but when i opened the box it wasn't what i expected at all. the book covers are practicly falling off the binding. the condition of the binding on the covers look as if the book was used in a game of football. The book does have all of its pages and includes the CD that was promised, just not as aesthetically pleasing as the seller described."
5,"Super fun, but not too educational","Ty Girlz is obviously for girls, which reduces the chances of it getting as many friends, although there are male fans...me...but thats only becasue it's fun. It's very customizable and the games are fun, even more fun than Webkinz most of the time. The only problem is that it isn't too educational. They do have some games that make you think, but where it lacks in education, it has creativity and imagination, which is just as useful as education. The only other probelm is that it sometimes doesn't show stuff and freezes, but it comes back if you restart it (mostly games)."
2,The funiest looking doll,"this doll has great features when you go online. but the doll itself is weird looking the intial reaction i got to this doll is ""man thats funny looking"" and to be honest i thought the same thing when i seen it for the first time. the picture shows a beautiful doll for kids. but when i recieved it i was suprised how the face looked patched on and the body was ungodly misshapened. not to mention the head is huge. so far no one that has seen it has liked it. i can only hope that the little girl that gets it will not be scared of it. maybe she will se the beauty inside of it who knows."
2,well written empty,"another book by a young canadian talent that portrays the vacous lives of a bunch of spoiled twentysomethings. this is supposed to be about something? a coming of age book, that misses the punch and danger of a trainspotting, or the rhythym and lust of a kerouac; in its favour it has much more mass and substance than a copeland.hopefully, also, its not too autobiographical. most of the characters are in the shallow end here.the twist at the end makes up for the time you spent getting there. almost.smith is a good writer, so go read ""young men"" instead."
4,Oh (no) Canada .... our home and insecure land,"This was a very enjoyable book that delivers what it promises. An inside look at the vacuous lives of the sad 20 somethings caught in a dangerous time in Canada's big city. After reading the reviews posted I am sad to see the Toronto bashing of those from outside the self-proclaimed ""Centre of the Universe"". You don't have to love Toronto to enjoy this book, but if you have a deep-rooted insecurity towards the city, maybe you should know better than to read it."
2,"Biased, but nevertheless an interesting read.","The author of this book is quite obviusly ""insanely"" jealous of Apple Computer and Steve Jobs, and as noted by other reviewers, there are some glaring editorial mistakes. That said, it is a very interesting book with alot of insights into the rise and fall and rise again of Apple. If you can get past the venomous attacks on Steve Jobs and the poor editing, you will find this book quite enthralling."
2,Poorly edited,While you can flog your way through this book and extract the history of Apple that would presumably be the resaon you tried to read it in the first place. It is so poorly organized and edited that one would question why you'd bother. Events and anecdotes are repeated over and over again (if we went to the preview of the movie with the white roses one more time I'd have screamed). Sentences aren't complete and tenses aren't correct. Had the book been orgainzed it could have been cut in size by half and been improved as a result.
2,Smacks of Sour Grapes,"Smacks of Sour Grapes. Whatever happened to impartial reporting (so says he's a journalist whom I'm willing to bet my G3, pretty likely poured gasoline on and danced in glee during Apple's troubled days in the past several years. There is a very decidedly negative tone immediately into the first few pages of this book. Certainly sounds to me as if Malone greatly dislikes and is insanely jealous of Steve Jobs' success. One can sense he's in the background scowling. I would stick with Steven Levy's Insanely Great for impartial writing and Owen Linzmayer's Apple Confidential for juicy niblets. Thumbs down on Infinite Loop; although thumbs up for the cover design. That's about all I can say. Thank you."
2,"Buy any of the other ""Apple History"" books instead.","A blizzard of minor factual errors and editing mistakes really brought down my enjoyment of this book. Ultimately, it's just more of the same, though.Read Levy's ""Insanely Great"" for the early history, and Carlton's ""Apple"" for the later part and you'll be a lot better off."
3,"Infinite Loop - definitely slanted, but comprehensive","As a devout Mac user, I've been interested in reading Infinite Loop since it was released. And boy is it good -- although it's definitely biased, and Malone certainly has an axe to grind with Steve Jobs and Apple.The book is good for recounting the story of Apple -- from its rise out of Jobs' garage to his sacking, the dark ages of the mid nineties and the company's reemergence with the iMac. Of course, Malone is skeptical about the iMac's success, and tries to pass his book off as an eulogy when it's clear that Apple is currently in the midst of a resurgance.More than anything, this is a corporate history, and is often mired down with business and technological details that might boggle the mind of the uninitiated. But if you're genuinely interested in Apple, the PC industry, and a fascinating story populated with colorful real-life characters (minus Gil Amelio of course), then you should check this book out."
5,Exquisitly Written,"Michael Malone did a pretty good job with this book. He has got an explosive combination of ingredients in this book: A perfect plot (Apple Computers History), amazing characters (Steve Jobs just as an example), Intrigue, Drama, Joy, and a lot more. Michael Malone mixed all this ingredients the right way, writting a very good novel/business book. He his sophisticated in his writting, yet very simplistic. I loved finishing the book understanding what he meant by infinite loop. I strongly advise you to find it out for yourself. You will not get disapointed and you will keep turning those pages very rapidly just like a good thriller. Don't get intimidated by the size of the book, or by the fact that is a corporate history book. In fact it is, but it could also be a science fiction novel. That's what is makes it so great."
3,To Infinity and Beyond,"Melodrama is always a page turner. And Malone had me turning pages quickly. While entertaining, the book had one considerable flaw: an overwillingness to pass off forced conclusions as psychological analysis. While I definitely enjoy ""Steve said this"" and ""Woz did that"", I can make my own reflections into they mean. Issues like identifying psycholgical motivation should always be mindful of thier subjectivity. Malone was not mindful.However, this book has peeked my interest in learning more about the company that' s given me such a lovely computer (Blue/White G3), and I'm currently seeking out other titles. Too bad I can't find biographies of Jobs or Woz."
5,Excellent Historical Value,This book gives insight and history to Apple. The best book about it yet!
1,"Nice try Malone...could have been way, way better!","Another so-so book in the HISTORY OF APPLE genre. Given Malone's rep in the Valley I was expecting a much better effort. Major gripes : 1) No photo sections. Duh! Inexcusable in an almost 600 page/$27.50 retail book from a major publisher 2) lots of annoying typos throughout the book. 3) too much reliance on work by other authors, not enough first hand interviews by Malone. 4) Loads of trite pop psychology theories about Jobs and Wozniak behavior and state of mind. 5) Latter half of the book much worse, more rushed than the first half. Typically seen when the publisher is bearing down on the author to get the title to market. Malone should have resisted. Maybe the second edition will address all this but probably not....."
5,The most comprehensive history of Apple Computer I've seen,"Great narrative as well as thoughtful, detailed analysis. Carefully researched. A few minor technical inaccuracies, but most readers won't care. Too bad the author didn't include photographs or more coverage of Apple's latest comeback. Overall, a highly interesting book on one of the most intriguing companies of all time"
3,This Target is less than Satisfactory,"First of all, the target arrived with a peice being broken. It was still workable though. Also, the target was alot smaller than I expected. The cheap plastic that this target is made of, easily breaks when you use a more powerful airsoft gun. The only real postive about the target itself is the fact that it has a catch net."
5,Jessie is a Superstar!!,Jessie Daniels is a superstar and I know that she will make it big time in the industry. She is a superstar both in the music business and at SSHOA!!
2,Reasons I don't like Jessie Daniels....,"REASONS NOT TO LIKE JESSIE1: Jessie Daniels is a very talented girl, but she basically sings the same type of song over and over again. I don't know about you guys, but I want a little variety.2: She looks like a very mean person on the cover.3: Isn't she supposed to be a Christian? Why is she singing about love stuff in Hello/Goodbye?4: ""Letting Go"" is rotten and is not well written."
5,beautiful,"Not only is this album amazing, but so is Jessie. I saw her in concert on June 11, 2006 and she is an amazing performer and truly gives everything's she's got in each and every song. I met her after the show and she's equally as amazing off stage. She's so down to earth and cares so much about her fans and is so thankful. The album is wonderful! I love love love it! My favorite song is the remix of ""Hold Me Now"" is so beautiful. I also enjoy Hello/Goodbye, The Noise, well, basically the whole album."
5,SHES AMAZING,"Ive been listening to her since her EP in 2003. Im glad shes finally breaking out. Standouts- Everyday, What I Hear, Hello/Goodbye, and Stand Out. The rest of the album is good also. The 9th track is not Human Being. Its a new song called I Will Wait For You"
3,THIS IS NOT DIDO,"JUST TO CLEAR UP SOME CONFUSION: This is not the same Dido who released the CD ""No Angel."" If you look up this CD on any other music site, you'll recognize the fact that there are two different artists here. Please take this into consideration. (I didn't listen to it so ignore my rating.)"
3,"THIS Dido did not sing ""No Angel""",This IS Nyoma Mwan Dido...not the Dido that everyone in this review seems to be is refering to. Another person already pointed this out.
3,Zen music,"I was looking for music for my home to create a zen environment and this CD was recommended to me by a massage Therapist. On the whole, I really liked the music, though I recommend you not listen to it, while driving! I too, was being directed to the 'No Angel' Cd by the ""other Dido"" when I looked in record stores. This is more of a New Age CD."
3,"DEBUT ""KSANA"" LACKS POLISH LIKE SOPHOMORE ""NO ANGEL""","First I would like to say...""I Love Dido"". A beautiful voice, and her latest CD ""No Angel"" is a 5 star wonder....However ""Ksana"" lacks the polish or production like ""No Angel""....Something is missing, the CD tends to drag a little more and each song runs into the other leaving you wondering when did one song begin and one end.My favorite cut on this CD is ""Aurora"", otherwise ""Ksana"" is good, but not great. ""No Angel"" shows up Dido's voice - like a star at Carnegie Hall, as for ""Ksana"" makes Dido sound like she is a wounded moose at Yellowstone.I would give this CD 2 stars, but I love Dido so much that because ""No Angel"" is such a gem, it makes up for ""Ksana's"" loss."
1,Ksana not worth it,"Trust me when I say, Don't Waste Your Money! I love ""No Angel"" by Dido. This doesn't even measure up to her. Skip this no name person and go check out ""No Angel."" Trust that it one hundred times more impressive."
3,"Decent Miles Album, But Some Not So Great Tunes","Let first say that I love Miles Davis' early work, but I found ""Round About Midnight"" to be one of his weakest albums in his entire early discography. Tunes like ""Ah-Leu-Cha,"" ""Two Bass Hit,"" (which at times sounds like a knock-off of Monk's ""Epistrophy"") and ""Tad's Delight"" really bring this album down to a mediocre level. Don't get wrong, the playing from this quintet is top-notch, but these tunes I mentioned are not worthy compared to the rest of the album. ""Round About Midnight"" is an example of how you could go wrong with John Coltrane, Red Garland, Paul Chambers, and Philly Joe Jones. All outstanding musicians, but they seemed to be very disconnected on this recording."
5,1st class Miles plus some hot Trane,"It's really hard to disagree with most of the reviewers; this is Miles at his lyrical and contemplative best, and John Coltrane is really spicing the things up with his rough tenor; contrasting the leader's horn very effectivelly...And yes, this is the album that has both the magnificent version of Monk's 'Round Midnight and the beautiful and extremely creative version of children song Bye Bye Blackbird! But there is also boppish Ah-Leu-Cha, sentimental and ironic All of You...Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on the bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums are a rhythm section at the same time powerfull and subtle, ideal for supporting and inspiring the horns..."
5,MILES DAVIS' FIRST COLUMBIA RECORD,"'Round About Midnight was Miles Davis' Columbia debut LP and one of his calmest recordings ever. The first song 'Round Midnight is an excellent old '50s song, recorded on 9/10/1956. The next song which was the first session Ah-Leu-Cha is excellent, recorded on 10/26/1955. All of You and Bye Bye Blackbird have really great piano. Bye Bye Blackbird is my favorite song here, it has the best piano. All the songs in this album are excellent as well as other Miles Davis. Get this with Kind of Blue and you can enjoy a relaxing late 1950s."
5,awesome quintet...legendary recording..,"Miles Davis first recording with Columbia Records. Miles, trumpet, John Coltrane, tenor saxophone, Philly Joe Jones, drums, Red Garland, piano, and Paul Chambers, bass. If there was a jazz Hall of Fame(why isn't there one?) they all would be in it. From that first note of 'Round About Midnight(a Thelonius Monk composition) this album just blows you away. Add this to your jazz collection and you'll find yourself listening to it over and over. A masterpiece. If DaVinci played jazz, it would sound something like this. I put this one along with Porgy and Bess and Kind of Blue as the essential Miles."
5,Masterpiece,It simply doesn't get any better. Miles' muted trumpet sound along with Coltrane's first amazing solos combine for a one of a kind album..the first with Columbia which marks a start of a great Davis-Coltrane decade. This is the same group that would form Kind of Blue along with Evans and Adderley. I definately recommend it for those who wan't to hear Miles' first steps in the world of modal jazz
5,Jazz at it's best,"This is a great cd to relax to throughout, it's the kind of disc that you would'nt play all the time but when you play it you realise that it's one of the best you own, smooth jazz the way it should be. The music really does get to you aswell which defines quality music."
5,If you love action and romance ...,"Briars fits the bill! This book is a must-read for all historical romance book lovers. It combines a fast-paced plot with a genuine feel of what the Old South must have been like. It has several likable, believable characters - and several very unlikeable, equally believable characters - to provide plenty of action. I read it while on vacation, and read the first half in one sitting. I probably would have finished it then, but my poor husband was making little ""are you ever going to put that book down"" noises and wanting me to go outside and vacation with him."
4,The life of Elizabeth,"I adore the movie Elizabeth. I thought it was a good showing for Elizabeth's ascent to the throne.I ended up buying this blu-ray double movie pack because my DVD of Elizabeth was dying. Since the double feature wasn't that expensive, I decided to get that.Elizabeth was great to watch on blu-ray.Elizabeth: the Golden Age. Visually, I loved it. The movie itself? It didn't gel as a movie.It didn't have the tension needed for the defeat of the Spanish Armada.So, Elizabeth, I give 5 stars, and Elizabeth: the Golden Age I give 3 stars.Which is why the double feature has 4 stars."
2,Not really jerky,"My dog likes it but it is not really jerky. It is more like small bits of dusty scraps, more like the size of training treats but almost powdery. I am always looking for lamb jerky because my dog does better with lamb but I won't buy this one again"
2,Student's Perspective,"Yes, this book has some great content. 2 stars because I hate the organization of the chapters. I feel like it jumps around too much within a given topic. I would not recommend this book for a pediatrics core rotation or for STEP prep. Pass on this and find a better text."
4,good but hard,I tired will again soon . maybe when get some others down and more confindent . i liked but got to get better to keep up to some honestly lol.
1,Like a Bad Ricky Martin Video...,"I've been doing workout videos for years, so its not like I haven't had experience with these things. But this video is ridiculous. The eclectic and dizzying mix of moves from the first 10 minutes was enough for me to throw my hands up and laugh. I don't think they repeat a single move more than twice in this entire video.They spent way too much time designing fancy Latin backdrops, strobe lights & black&white disco cinematography. Not to mention the laughable scantily-clad Latin chicks that sit along the sidelines and whistle at those sweating and rump-shaking in the video. A little more time needed to be spent designing a routine that was actually feasible to accomplish. If you're looking for a GOOD Richard Simmons tape, I'd recommend the Mega-Mix Blastoff. It's a lot easier to follow and a LOT less cornball. But if you're looking for a good laugh, pick this up today!"
4,Worth a try if you are bored with excercise tapes!,"I have just finished my first attempt with this routine. Sure, the dance steps were a bit hard to get down, so I just did my best to mimic the first time, but what fun. There are real dancers in Latin costume, and because the men were in pants and the women in dresses, I could see their legs well enough to see the dances. It was easier to learn than when I first tried the Richard Simmons Dance Your Pants Off. I had so much fun, that I didn't realize I was sweating until the cool down. The routine went fast too, because of the fun. Don't let the dance steps discourage you, just do your best and you'll be dancing away in no time. These dancing excercise tapes have been better than just a way to excercise. I have become better coordinated, more graceful, and learned dance steps, too."
1,Bad Bad ...,"I have tried this video two times now, and frankly it just makes me angry. The professional dancers that stock this video are nauseating, ... The routines do not give a balanced workout as they stand--I can just dance around in my living room and get the same result. It would have been nice if the exercises were *adapted* from dance moves and targeted all body parts, instead of just being taken as is complete ... . The warm up at the beginning is almost a joke, the toning portion was weak, and there is no abs workout at the end. Richard seems to have tried to appeal to a different audience with this one, but I was just sorry I had wasted my money on it."
4,Totally Hits 2003,"It's good but when is Totally Hits 2003 coming out? I have some suggestions for it they are1. Kid Rock/Sheryl Crow ""Picture""2. Santana/Michelle Branch ""Game of Love""3. Avril ""I'm With You""4. Kelly Clarkson ""A Moment Like This""5. Jewel her new one6. Madonna ""American Life""7. Faith Hill ""Cry"""
4,Total Hits 2002 More Platinum Hits,"12. ""Get Here"" by Justin Guarini - Love this song. Also, love ""Inner Child"" and ""Sorry"" on his newest CD. 5/56. ""Heaven"" by DJ Sammy & Yanuou - Great rendition of this song!! 5/5"
3,"Good story, but...","I'm definitely going to read the sequel because now I've just got to know what happens with Kari and Ryan. There were a lot of things I really liked about the story. I guess the writing bothered me. I've just finished reading a few of Francine Rivers' books and she is such an exquisite writer. The beginning of REDEMPTION was slow for me. It was slow because Karen Kingsbury details the anguished thoughts of the characters OVER and OVER again until you just want to scream--""OK!! I get it!! I think this went on for 100 pages. I almost didn't make it past that. But it gets a lot better!"
4,Highly Recommend!,The entire Redemption series has been fascinating and addictive to read. The authors do a wonderful job weaving the story line throughout each novel. Return blew my socks off. Ignore the negative reviews; they're not true!!
5,One of my FAVORITES!,"This is an inspiring book that you won't be able to put down! The storyline and plots are unpredictable and intriguing and the subtle teaching from Gary Smalley is helpful, but not preachy, b/c the characters are just learning stuff. I ordered the entire series b/c as soon as I finish one...I want the next! I am in love with the characters...I have even caught myself praying for them several times! :) Definitely get this book!!!"
4,A Christian Perspective on Some of Life's Difficult Issues,"This book presents a Christian perspective on dealing with infidelity in a marriage. Kari is a young woman who is faced with the reality that her husband is involved with one of his college students. Although in the eyes of many, she would be justified in grating him a divorce and moving on, she makes the difficult decision to honor her wedding vows and try to save their marriage. The book presents this issue from a Christian perspective and demonstrates that life is not trouble-free if you are a Christian. What I liked about the book is that it honestly addresses struggles that are faced by many people, Christian and non-Christian. I plan to read the other books in the series to find out how God works in the lives of Kari and her family."
5,Love this...,This series is excellent. I want to know and be friends with or even be related to the Baxter Family. I will be so sad when the books are over. Very encouraging and I recommend to everyone.
3,Hard to leave,"The beginning of the book and the subject of betrayal, could have been very depressing but I really wanted to know what the title had reference to. Whether this man could have been forgiven and the turnaround. I didn't see how so it kept me involved. I loved all the good references to family,their times together and their loyalty to their daughter and sister. Very surprising ending. I think it was very well written."
1,Christian Fiction?,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. However, I was extremely disappointed. It just seems that Karen Kingsbury writes trashy fiction for Christians and in my opinion the way this book turned out I don't even see this as Christian fiction at all. It was littered with adultery and in the end we get the sense that the Lord would reward the adultery (I have not read the other books in this series and will never touch another Karen Kingsbury book again). I won't give away the ending. Unfortunately, Ms. Kingsbury tries desperately to write like Francine Rivers and even copies the manner by which she places Scripture but she is far from the gifted writing of Francine Rivers. Francine Rivers actually chooses topics of depth not the trashy romantic novel reinvented in a Christian paperback that I am so sick and tired of....No more Karen Kingsbury for me..."
1,disappointing,"I am very disappointed with the book. I agree with the original critic - it reads more like a self-help book than a literary novel. The adultery, alcohol described in the book seem very unrealistic and organized to create certain points that the author wants to get across to the reader. I would find it hard to believe if this author has any real understanding of the circumstances that they try to describe in the book."
1,"If you like sappy, soapy stories this is for you","Unfortunately, I don't like sappy, soapy stories. I gagged my way through the first 20% of this Kindle book, then hopped quickly through to the end. I'm so glad I didn't pay any money for this one; not only is the story soapy, but there's an extreme amount of preaching going on.I read this to take a bit of a break from my usual fare of fast paced thrillers - it served the purpose for that."
3,Who is really redeemed?,"Although I loved this book, I found it to be a little unorganized. Though the book was very easy to read, the story seemed to be too ""jumbled"", and it really had no new surprises to it. Throughout most of the book, the same occurences happened over and over, and the only reason I kept reading, was to see if something new would happen. I think that the authors did however, capture the reader by making the characters easy to relate with.I think that because the author picked a topic that many couples go through, it catches the readers attention just what's going to happen.Though this book is touching, it still needs something more."
1,A TOTALLY HARD TO SWALLOW STORY!!!!,"POORLY WRITTEN STORY WITH HARD TO SWALLOW FACTS. FROM TOTALLY ""DRY"" TO TOTALLY SLOPPY DRUNK IN LESS THAN THREE MONTHS...PREACHY ON EVERY PAGE!!!!, HARD BOILED ADULTERY WITHOUT REMORSE, BY A CRUEL BACKSLIDDEN ""CHRISTIAN"",---NOT THE LEAST BIT ""REDEEMING!!!!!! NOT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE THOUSANDS OF SHODDY ROMANCE PAPERBACKS ON EVERY SHELF IN THE STORES!!!!!"
5,Best series ever!!!,"I was given the first two books in this series as a Christmas gift from my prayer pal at church. That was 2 yrs ago. I have read the complete series twice & will probably read them again when time allows. I purchased the remaining books from Amazon & others by Karen as well. I have never been disappointed by her work. Karen is amazing!! Her writing will touch you in a way no one else can. I highly recommend her books, especially this series!!! You will fall in love as I did. She has become my favorite author!"
5,Loved It!,"Redemption is the first book in Karen Kingsbury's amazing Baxter series. I started reading Karen Kingsbury's books a few years ago, and there isn't a book she's written that I haven't LOVED!"
5,Redemption by Kingsbury,This is the best Christian novel I have read since Lahaye series. I am really looking forward to the next book in the series.
5,Love this book,"I love this book. I have laughed, cried, became angry while reading this book. God has really given Mrs. Kingsbury a gift. I love her books."
3,Good book but a little slow,I liked it but I had to push through to get to the end. The books after it are better but if you don't read this one you wont understand whats happening in the rest
4,God's Sufficiency,"Redemption by Karen Kingsbury has greatly influenced me. Kari is one character that I would desire to emulate from this book. She has a love for the Lord that stays strong during all the trials and hardships she faces. Her faithfulness to God and to her husband taught me a lot about life and being willing to forgive others. A verse that encourages Kari often throughout the book is 2 Corinthians 12:9: ""My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."" Through Kari's example of living out this verse, I learned to rely on the Lord's grace during difficulties."
4,Commonality,"Redemption is my second experience with Karen Kingsbury's novels and with Christian fiction as a whole. I was reminded that even (or perhaps especially) believers have the same struggles and temptations as the rest of the world. Besides the fact that nearly every character was notably ""stunning"" or ""gorgeous"" (thus 1 less star), I was able to relate my own family with the Baxters. I particularly enjoy the series format and the teaser in the end... couldn't wait to get my hands on book #2."
4,Great Series- some spoilers,"I have read almost all of Karen Kingsbury's books and I at least like them all. This was the first book by her that I ever read. The story focuses on Kari Baxter, the second eldest daughter in a family of five but also touches on the rest of the family that you learn more about through out the series. Kari has been married to Tim awhile before the story begins and their marriage is definitely in trouble. While Kari struggles with martial problems, Ryan, her high school sweet heart moves back into town. Kari and Tim learn that true love is not just a feeling but deeper commitment and struggle with their individual relationships with Jesus Christ.My only criticisms are the same for many of Karen's books. Sometimes she makes things too neat when real life is messy, though this book's ending is possible it just isn't likely. And then there's her fascination with high school sweet hearts."
2,Just Okay,"I really enjoyed the Father Tim stories written by Jan Karon. I was hoping this series of books would be as enjoyable. However, the writing is very choppy and it is difficult to like the characters. I have been loaned the series, but I am just not interested in trying the next story.Jan Karon, we need more Father Tim books."
4,Amazing!,"This is one of the best books I've ever read! I had my doubts when I first read the back, I'd never read anything so intamite before, but it's a wonderfull story. It beautifully illustrates the fact God will always be there for us.The reason I rate this with a 4 instead of a 5 is I was slightly disapointed with the ending, namely how it ended with Tim. Otherwise I was very happy with it."
3,Just so you know...,"I was not a fan of christian novels but after reading a few I must admit i like the simple quailties and the outlook on life. I don't read to many but every once in a while it's a pleasure to read something uplifting but i didn't find this novel uplifting in the least. Everything comes together to easily and even when trajedty strikes it strikes in a way that doesn't make you sad at all. Someone else said it on here so i know i won't be recking anything. This novel leaves you to a great decision, will she choose her husband or the love of her life, and in the end she gets both. Life isn't perfect and it erks me to read novels that tend to make life that way. Do we really want the novels we read to reflect life or do we want the perfect happily ever after?> personally this novel had either. It was written very well but the ending was so disapointing and not at all real."
5,exquisite!,"These books are wonderful! That's all I can say. My father has been in the hospital for a week and I used this chance to read these fabulous books! I am a Christian and am usually not a fan of Christian fiction as I find it insipid and usually not well written. These books are the exception! If you overlook the ""beautiful"" characters, the rest is pure poetry! Real people with real struggles with God.Real issues and Godly resolutions not without consequence! I highly recommend you buy all 5 at once as you won't be able to get enough! Enjoy!"
2,Slow reading --have read better.,I was very dissapointed. It was slow reading-- jumped over a lot of pages. I ended up looking for last chapter
5,Excellent !!!,"For those of you who have been following the water revolution, with books like You're Not Sick, You're Thirsty! Dr. Batmanghelidj, and The Message from Water - Dr. Masaru Emoto, you'll want The Water Puzzle and the Hexagonal Key to be your next book. Now translated in 5 languages, this one puts all the pieces together. It will revolutionize your thinking about water! It's the one we've all been waiting for! Every doctor and patient should read this immediately."
2,Beach Party ~ Various Artists,"Well, honestly except for my all-time fav. ""the thong song"" I didnt find much to listen to (the 2 stars are only for this one song)."
5,Good Natured Humor for a Bruising Political Season!,"If, like me, you are more than a little fed-up with the brutal attacks and partisanship of this year's election, Pat the Politician will provide a welcome relief. A parody of the children's classic, Pat the Bunny, this humorous book pokes (and pulls) fun at folks on both sides of the aisle. Grown-up kids can pull at Barbara Bush's hair, stroke Bill Clinton's underpants, read Bush I's lips, feel Al Gore's wooden personality, and much more. This is great fun in a year that hasn't given us much to laugh about."
5,Very Nice! Is as described.,"This was purchased as a gift for somebody else. IMO it appears to be of good quality. I am satisfied with this item and would purchase it for, and wear it myself."
3,It's a hard drive.,Hard to get too excited about an HD for an old Dell server that should have been put down years ago. It does what it was made to do.. Service was great. Fast delivery.
5,Cute,"I bought this and the farmer's wife to go along with a wooden stable. My daughter enjoys this addition to the stable. The hat comes off, which is fun. I have yet to be let down by Plan Toys... high quality, safe, and easy on the eyes. You'll hesitate to buy plastic toys after having some of these toys laying around!"
4,Plan Toys Farmer- a hard-working guy!,"This is a great little toy. My 3 year old son has a John Deere wooden barn with the 1:16th scale tractors. This farmer fits the tractors perfectly. We purchased the farmer's wife as well and my son thinks it's hilarious when she ""kisses"" the farmer goodbye as he leaves for the day on his tractor. We also purchased the ""Animalz"" brand of wooden farm animals. The animals are not quite to scale but are cute, wooden and durable. The farmer's hat doesn't want to stay on very well, but this doesn't seem to matter at all to my son. Fun toys, no batteries required.....imagination driven!!!!"
3,Too Tall for Plan Toys Barn,"I ordered this toy, thinking my two-year old could use it with his Plan Toys barn (which we love). Two things I want to share with others who are considering purchasing the farmer:1. The farmer is too tall to fit through the barn's doorway unless you remove the farmer's hat or turn him at an angle. I don't think he works very well with the barn.2. This does not seem like a good toy for a two-year-old. I'm going to stick with the manufacturer's recommended age on this and save it until my son is three (or perhaps older)."
1,Utterly Predictable,"This lame take on ""West Side Story"" -- substitute gays and Latinos in East L.A. for ""whites"" and Puerto Ricans in NYC -- is predictable almost from the opening scene. Worse, most of the gay characters exist only for cheap laughs at their stereotyped behavior. It's idiotic. One more thing: In a genre where the DVD jackets bear little resemblance to reality, this one takes fantasy to a new level. The flick's skin quotient is fine, but it's nowhere near as much as the jacket indicates. On the plus side, Rene Alvarado does a nice job, considering a poorly written script that has him alternating between sulking jerk and the perfect boyfriend. (Having said all that, I'm a sucker for any gay romance film, so there were enough threads to make it worth a look -- assuming you rent it rather than buy it.)"
4,Enjoyable film,"Well done gay film that touches upon such universal themes as homophobia, racism, family, and of course, love. Well directed and acted, the film follows a Latino's crash course in love in the gay world. A slight of hand drama heavily punctuated with humour, I found this to be a very enjoyable, and for the most part, realistic portrayal of life, love, and gay culture. Recommended."
4,One of the better gay movies,"My boyfriend and I watched this movie for the very first time this past week. At first I didn't think it was going to be that good but I gave my boyfriend the benefit of the doubt and watched it anyways. I thought the one pretentious gay boyfriend was too stereotypical....unless that's the way they really are in L.A. Having seen some of the other gay movies that are out there, this is one of the better ones. It's one that I am going to add to my collection."
4,fun with a happy ending,"I enjoyed this silly little love frolic. Not a realistic story in my opinion but sweet and enjoyable never the less... Sooooo, Sit back and enjoy the East-Side Journey with someone you love."
4,Overcomes poor film technique,"Set in east LA about a gay Latino man, Diego, and his coming out who has hidden furtive encounters with Pablo, a successful real estate broker who lives in denial and loves roleplaying. Anglo homo's are moving in and gentrifying the neighborhood to the concern of many folks. Bianca (formerly Blanca) breezes in from Europe and everything is in place for the free-for-all.It was interesting, and frustrating, to watch the back and forth nature of the plot: Two characters get together...break up...back together... There is some tension between one GWM (a twink from Mississippi) and a hilarious moment with an AA group meeting in his house. Even with the predictability of the plot several characters grew on me, notably the sister who I was ready to kill at the beginning and hug at the end.The movie could have used a better lighting engineer, there were many scenes that were difficult to see because low light was ill aimed. However, it wasn't a deal breaker."
4,EXCELENTE,UNA EXCELENTE HISTORIA MUY INTERESANTE EL UNICO DEFECTO QUE TIENE LA PELICULA ES UNA VEZ MAS QUE LA PELICULA NO TIENE SUB TITULOS EN ESPAÑOL ALGO RARO PUESTO QUE LA PELICULA ESTA EN ESPANGLISH EL RESTO ES IMPERDIBLE MUY INTERSANTE PERO POR FAVOR HAY QUE HACER ALGO CON LOS SUBTITULOS
1,Minority man with a brain,"Although I try to avoid Gay Cinema at all cost because it is usually terrible, I decided to get this movie due to the fact that I saw on a rating that it had four and a half starts. What a bunch of crap and waste of time this is! Geez, can you put any more Mexican and Gay stereotypes in this instulting and derrogatory movie. Give me a brake, what Gay man (especially a Mexican Gay man)really looks like that or acts that way? It is no wonder that gay and straight men grow up with such problems as to the way they look. In addition, I feel that this type of movie creates more danger for gay teens' self-estem that any bigotry and discrimination that straight society can dish at them. In conclusion, if you really want to exercise your mind and feel proud about being Gay or a member of any minority, then watch a creative and well-done movie such as ""Milk"" and skip this garbage."
4,Great film on the struggles/pressures of different cultures on coming out,"If you liked Mambo Italiano, this film has quite a lot in common with that one. Replace Italian culture in Montreal with Latino culture in East L.A. and you've got the jist of it. For those of you who struggled with acceptance from your non-Anglo families and the pressures around machismo for men and generally negative perceptions of LGBT folk, this story is for you. The only flaw in the script is the one dimensional character of the white boyfriend who is so racist. We all know people who say this stuff about other races, in closed company, but it's drawn a bit broadly when he says it in front of the main character. But then again, I've seen some pretty stupid/racist fags in my day, so it's plausible that this happens. It just didn't ring true for me in either the screenplay or the performance. The cast is otherwise quite good for a low budget picture. Well worth it!"
4,East Side Story - a pleasant surprise!,One of the best gay latino themed comedies I have seen in a long time. Great believable cast. Plot is clever and not overly gay (campy) Well done. One enjoyable film from start to finish.
3,"OK, But Nothing Special....","This was highly rated, so I took a chance. Filmed on digital video with some fairly bumpy camerawork and poor lighting and the usual low-level sound quality. Well written and Nicely performed, but sluggishly directed and edited. I wanted to enjoy this much more than I actually did. When all was said and done, the end result was OK. Not memorable. I won't watch it again. I know we need positive gay-themed films, and I'm more than intune with the low budgets/constraints that must be dealt with. BUT...we also need well crafted works. This film comes painfully close, but it was ultimatly predictable and unimaginative. If the director was in tune with the material, it doesn't show. Please, when you review these films...Demand Better!"
3,"Charming film, not a musical","This is a charming low-budget film about gay romance and jealousy set in a Latino community. The community's response in the story is by no means uniform -- both acceptance and rejection are represented. Bigotry is strong, but so is love, according to this story, and characters are shown standing up to bigotry. The title ""East Side Story"" is a misleading take off on ""West Side Story."" This is not a musical, and it is not set in New York. The tension here is not principally between Latinos and Anglos, but between gays and some straights and between the out and the closeted. The film is about 90 minutes long, and the disc includes an interesting interview with the filmmaker, in which he talks about various scenes, casting, directing, and film making technique as most of the film runs again."
5,Tasha Tudor and her beloved corgis,"Not merely one of the finest children's book artists, but one of the finest naturalist artists period. This book well showcases her sense of whimsy as well as her eye for detail. Add to that her obvious love for her corgis, and you've got a book that is a can't miss!"
5,Adorable artwork,"This book has very cute, old-fashioned illustrations and hearken back to days long gone (waaaaay before my time).The story is very simplistic and a bit underwhelming (to an adult), but the artwork more than makes up for it. The pages are covered with many beautiful, highly detailed and imaginative scenes that look very 1930's or 1940's Americana countryside. In this book, corgis, bunnies and other furry critters live and work in the country, tending to farms and working the fields.The good:- Beautiful, imaginative artwork.The bad:- Overly simplistic storyline.All in all, it's a great children's book. As an adult, I think the story is overly simple but I think kids will enjoy this. I personally got this book for the cute corgi illustrations so in that respect, I give it 5 stars...."
2,Great Art. Terribly Sexist and Problematic Writing.,"I bought this book because I am an avid corgi enthusiast, and a teacher. I was pumped about reading it, potentially even with students. However, the book is terribly sexist, offers heterosexuality as inherently American...I don't even know where to start. If you are a progressive, or at all socially aware, just avoid it. Or, like me, keep it for the art, enjoy tht, and perhaps cover the pages with another story."
4,Duron-Excellent Pop,"When I first heard this CD I fell in love with it. It is the ultimate Pop Christian album. It has the sound of early Jump5 but instead of somewhat more mainstream words like Jump5 tends to do, there is a obvious Christian Message in each one. I love the 80's touch to songs like ""Someday"" and the Poppy sound to songs like ""You and Only You"" If you're into A*Teens, Jump5, Aaron Carter, or early Brittany Spears but you want a Christain touch, then I highly recommend this album."
2,Too complicated for the uncordinated,"I bought these videos because I enjoyed the Sweatin to the Oldies series, but this was not the same at all. I put the Latin dance tape in and was so confused that I gave up in the first two minutes. I continued to watch the entire tape and felt there was no way I would ever learn all the moves and never put it back in. There was poor cueing, you would need to watch the tapes many times first in order to do a first time work out and follow along. Stick with the Sweatin' series."
2,Not Recommended,"Well, some parts of the videos, are like a bad rap video, it is as if Richard Simmons forgets he is hosting a excersize video. Too much hooting and hollering, sometimes so much you cant understand what is going on. Not recommended for a overweight person who cant move fast, you will feel hopeless and confused"
2,Caution - only half of what's on the DVD,"This instant video only contains half of what's on the DVD if you purchase it. The DVD also includes the Hero Factory 2.0 episode ""Ordeal of Fire"". My kids were very disappointed that this was not included. The description does not indicate this and the cover looks exactly like the DVD."
5,A Lego Christmas,I am very happy with the time and effort put into getting the product we ordered for my grandson. Thank you. Ina
1,Not an official release,"Lest anyone think that Paul is ripping you off, this is not an official McCartney release. Don't waste your money."
4,Easy shaver,"Easy to use, easy to clean, and the battery lasts and lasts. Shaves are quick, but closeness takes a little longer. Be careful not to press this shaver too hard against your face or it might leave some shaver abrasion. All in all, I like this shaver very much, but it took more getting used to than my other one."
2,not as good a norelco xl,"I have a very thick beard with hair that grows in odd directions on my neck (problem area). This was too rough and powerful and if i pushed too hard it would burn my skin. With the norelco xl i could at least push as hard as i wanted too. I know it sounds odd, but this was way too powerful for my beard. I tried to switch to this from the norelco quadra action, but i ended up returning this for the norelco xl."
2,Not worth the money,"Bought this recently on amazon. I have had Braun electric razors for several years now. Prior to this I had the Braun 7526. For whatever reason, I don't know if its the new foil on the 8585, but this razor just doesn't shave as close as my previous Braun. I am actually going back to my old one. Not sure what the design flaw is, but definitely not worth the money."
3,braun activator,"bought the braun, thought it would be better than the remington that I was replacing. I was so wrong, takes twice as long to shave as it use too. The shaver does leave a smooth finish."
5,Works for me,"I have been using this product for about 2 years. I only use it when I need it so I do not take it everyday. The bottle says to take 2 caps a day but I found that 2 caps makes me sleepy so I take 1. I only take this product when I am having stressfull day or when I am going to be doing something (travel, meeting new people etc.)that I would like to be more relaxed for. One cap. just makes me feel calmer and takes the edge off. It is worth the price."
5,calm and relaxed,"this is a wonderful product, i suffer with TMJ and it makes a difference in my life. it keeps me happy and centered, to handle the day with joy!!!! in todays busy world, everyone could benifit from primal calm. i bought a bottle for my mom and my niece. they both love the happy, feelings they experience. great quality and Great company. Everybody deserves to be ""Happy""!!!!"
1,Rip off,"My husband forked over the $60 for this product and it doesn't work at all. he's been using it only a week or so, but he doesn't feel any better with it. The return policy sucks! You can't return it if you've opened it. But you can't find out if it works or not till you OPEN it to use it! So now we're out $60 on an anti-anxiety medication that doesn't do anything! Dont waste your money."
3,"Handsome , high-quality stuff","This is a book of good-looking and well-designed outdoor spaces adjacent to good-looking houses. The things - plants, furniture, outdoor cooking gear - that the owners/designers have placed in the outdoor places is expensive, and it does look great. One admires the scenes. So it's more of a small-scale coffee-table book than a how-to guide."
5,No Mystery Here,Have been a long time fan of AHMM and welcomed it onto my Kindle. May consider getting a yearly subscrition!
1,Pass the Savings on to the Consumer!,"At least part of the cost of a magazine subscription is determined by the cost of the materials used in its publication. The cost of paper will do more to influence the price of a newspaper or magazine than anything else. The printing press, the ink, warehouse storage, and finally the cost of actually mailing it out.So why is a digital version, which eliminates all of the materials cost, and most of the delivery cost (pennies for bandwidth) priced the same as or more than the print version?Consumers aren't stupid, and I have no intention of paying for this product until the publishers pass off some of the savings on to the consumers, giving us a financial incentive to go green, instead of trying to take advantage of our desire for convenience."
3,Why is electronic more expensive than print?,"I was given some old copies of this magazine and really enjoyed reading it. I have been considering buying a Kindle and wanted to see what was offered, besides the books. I checked out the subscription price of the print version and was surprised to find that the electronic was more expensive by $.50 an issue. Shouldn't electronic delivery be cheaper than print?"
3,Why so expensive?,"I don't understand why Dell is charging as much or more for the Kindle magazine as the price of a printed and mailed version. Kindle books are cheaper than the printed versions, this magazine should be priced like Reader's Digest. I would be interested in subscribing if it was."
4,Totally adequate,"I picked these up to add to our ""home theater"" experience. We have a less than ideal space, ancient main speakers, an ordinary TV, and average technology IQ. These speakers turned out to be totally adequate. They were easy to set up, sound good, look good, and definitely improved the quality of our movie watching. I wouldn't consider them music speakers per se, and wouldn't recommend them to audiophiles, but they are totally adeqaute and inexpensive."
4,Pretty damn good,"Put simply, I like this set. I'm picking up a 2nd one for my wife. I had tried the ""behind the head"" style with a bluetooth Logitech headset before and I didn't like it, but I picked up a pair of these at Target one day as I wanted to try communicating when playing Team Fortress 2. I was very happy with the result, and thus I decided to rate it at my favorite online store since I was going to pick up a 2nd set.I hope other players pick these up, if only so that I don't have to listen to crappy quality when I play TF2. The quality of the sound with these is terrific for voice communication. I don't use the mic when I play Counter-Strike: Source (and I mute others) so that I can focus on shots, nade-tosses, and footsteps, and when you play CS:S with a good headset people think you're cheating - it's that nice of an experience.HTH"
4,Great Headset with some Minor Irritation,"This is an excellent headset for the price you pay. The sound quality is adequate, and the microphone picks up your voice, but the bit that goes over your ears takes a bit of getting used to. This headset is not designed for long-term use on a single day without some conditioning, as the ear supports start feeling a bit sharp after a few hours, and can cause blisters if you ignore it (this is from personal experience =P). If you only plan to use it for an hour or two at a time, this is a great headset, but if you're a hardcore gamer with lots of time on your hands, go for something with a different design or more padding."
3,Very low input gain,"The audio on the headset isn't bad, but like almost every other microphone-in-a-headset I've used the input gain on this will have you shouting to be heard, even with the input volume on your computer maxxed. If only the mic stalk were just a centimeter longer it would place it right in front of my mouth, where it might be able to pick up my voice better. It seems like this is designed for someone with their mouth centered on their left cheek. That being said, for the price this is a workable solution until something better comes along."
5,Amazing Quality at a great price,"I borrowed this off one of my friends because the other headset I purchased was horrible. This headset is crystal clear, and it is loud on both ends. The mic definately blocks out any unwanted sounds and it is a joy to use. It pinches at the top so beware if you have large ears. But at the price it can't be beat. its definately worth more than they ask for it."
1,Awesome,After about a weeks of use the audio jack snapped in half for me.. since then i just replaced the wiring with the one from my old set..
5,biz diva,I used the headset for ip telephone. I works great. I would encourage anyone to purchase this model.
3,"Great basic headset, but cuts into the ears","This is a great headset for the price, but I ran into some comfort issues. This headset wraps around the back of the head, not over the top and there is a groove along the band where the wire connects the left speaker to the right speaker. This band sits on top of your ears and after extended use, the channel tends to abrade the ears. Bummer, cuz it's great in every other respect."
5,Great Sound Quality In and Out,I was at first surprised to get this thing in less than 24 hours. I plugged it into my PC and used it right away. I was able to hear music from games and people's voices very clearly and the people I talked to said that my voice was coming in perfectly. I just find this works extremly well.
2,Ouch,"I've had this product for a while now and after using it for 15-20 minutes it hurts my ears. All of its weight is supported by the top of your ears and it leaves a dent from the pressure at the top of your ear, right where your glasses would sit.The headphones sound quality is ok, but I have people complain when I'm using the mic that I sound like I'm in a tunnel. Also the spongy mic cover has worn out and fallen off. There are 6 barbs like on a fish hook that held the cover on that are sort of sharp.I'm looking for a different headset."
3,Not so comfortable in the head...,"This headset is basically a standard "" not out of this world"" gaming headset. The plastic that surrounds the head gets very uncomfortable after a few hours of play, bringing your ears a little of pain. The sound quality is so so, stereo standard..."
2,Mediocre behind the ear fit - the darn thing keeps slipping down,"The headset has a great price and is pretty reliable, but it doesn't get a good fit on the listener's ears. It sort of loosely hangs NEAR your ears instead of neatly fitting on your ear like most headsets. Because of this, the quality of the sound of the game, or anything else you are listening to, is significantly diminished. You can hold the ear-pieces against your ears for better sound, but that is so cheesy. It would be a lot better if it fit tightly to your ear without having to use both hands. The behind the ear fit is too loose and doesn't work very well. But aside from that, the device is pretty good."
5,"Very good Item, no complains",This headset is very good. Sond quality and the volume button is very usefull. Nothing bad to say.
3,Doesn't work for the Mac :(,Package states that it doesn't work for the Mac. Boo Hoo. I have to send it back.
2,Designed for...?,"I bought this product and 20 minutes after using it my ears hurt. Not only that, but the headphones are too big to fit pretty snug yet the mic is too SHORT...so, who is this designed for?"
3,Fine for the price,"For the price, you can not ask for more. The only issue I've is that it can be a little uncomfortable on top of the ear on the wire side."
2,Not good enough,"I bought this for playing World of Warcraft and I'm going to have to get a better headset. This one is comfortable enough for extended play, and the sound quality is good, but the primary reason I bought it was because I needed a microphone as well for talking with my friends while playing. The microphone is either not sensitive enough, or the arm is too short - but whatever the problem is, my friends tell me they can barely hear me even when I have the settings up to full."
1,"cuts ears, bad sound quality","First, the sound quality is very, very poor. In part it may be because the earphones are not adjustable in any way so the ear pieces just half-heartedly cap over your ears. The around-the-back band is loose, and also non-adjustable. I am not sure how the people playing instruments in the ad picture manage to leave them on. The over-the-ear design is horrible; they cut into the ears."
4,Good product!!!,"The Gaming headset is a very good deal and has come in very very useful.The price is cheap,and its a great item.Great deal."
4,Extreme what?,"Headset works just fine. Microphone works well and headphones appear to produce all the sounds my soundcard can make. Only complaint is the inflexible headphone position. They don't fit exactly right on my ears and I can't adjust them. Also bought the less expensive version of this Logitech product and discovered the only difference were some multi-colored plates that fit on the ear pieces. Big deal! I bought it to use with Skype and not for PC gaming. Now that Skype costs, I may not be using these very much."
3,Functional and cheap,"The sound is pretty good from these.....average on comfort....only annoying thing is they don't fold up as much as I'd like, you kind of have to bend them flat....but can't go wrong for the price"
1,poor audio quality,"Just opened these, returning them now. Poor quality microphone, flimsy construction. You get what you pay for in this case. Sounded awful on Skype. Note NOT a USB connection headset."
2,Great Headphones; Bad Mic,"If anyone wants great sound expected from Logitech products, this pair of headphones does the job. But for me, a gamer, these headphones are inadequite.First of all, these headphones take a little getting-used to, but will feel comfortable after a couple days of use. Beware though, the headphones do not come with an adjustable piece which goes behind the head, so some (such as me) may find it very cumbersome with these headphones only secured to your head with the over-the-ear plastic.Secondly, the microphone on the headphones sorely lacks voice recognition: I had to move the microphone right in front of my mouth for it to pick up anything. On top of that, the microphone broke after a couple weeks of use.Overall, I would go to another Logitech product if I were you."
3,unconfterable performance,These head phones work pretty well but if you wear them for more than a half hour your ears start to hurt pretty bad. Eventually you get used to it and these headphones work well.
4,Great Product,"Very nice set of headphones, and the mic is great too. Only problem is that it can get hurt your ears to use and the headphones let alot of sound get into the room but other than that it is fantastic."
4,Logitech PC Gaming Headset,"All in all, a pretty good product. My only complaint is that when you wear it for a long time the hard plastic parts that go around your ears start to hurt a bit. Also, I haven't actually gotten the microphone to record more than a little garbled static, but i'm 99% sure thats a problem with my computer, not the microphone."
3,I received defective product,"I got a headset with a malfunctioning mic, although the sound quality is pretty amazing, I don't recommend this product since the mic seems to break down easily. Mine was working well, but at the second day, started to fail, then it failed completely.Duration: 4 Days."
2,Short-term treasure,"Stopped working after 3 months of use. Used it for Skype, but now people on the other end can't hear me.It was good while it lasted, I guess.Overall, not recommended."
4,Not too bad on the whole,"I've only had my headset for about a week now, so far the quality is as I expected for the price. The cord is long but not obnoxiously long. The only real downside is, as mentioned in many other reviews, that it hurts your ears after several hours of wearing. Perhaps I still need to get used to them, but it's irritating at first.In conclusion, buy if you don't plan on doing long periods of wearing and if you're on a tight budget."
4,Nice headset,"I received and began using this headset yesterday, and it's been awesome so far. They did hurt after a while of using them, but you really shouldn't keep headphones on for several hours consecutively in the first place, as it promotes bacteria growth in your ears...It has a large range of volume control and the audio input/recording is very clear, as identified by some playbacks of myself as well as people I chatted with. If you're familiar with your computer's sound systems and internal volume adjustments, you should have absolutely no problem with the tech end of this headset."
2,Uncomfortable,"The headset works well. The price was cheap. The only downside is that its uncomfortable. My ear turn red after 30min of using the product. It annoys me so much that it discourages me from using it any further. Overall it works fine for its price but as for being comfortable, its hard for me to adapt. Hope this review help those who are seeking a new headset. If you are looking for a cheap, good one... this is fine if you dont mine having red ears. I recommend those who are looking for a headset to be highly comfortable with it."
1,Beware,"It's a pain to wear, and the sound isnt that great. But the kicker here is that after only 3 weeks of use, the microphone started making horrible high pitched sounds whenever I talk. Making it impossible to use for gaming when most people get sick of hearing it and muted me. So beware, some say it lasts and its good for the price. Mine on the other hand didnt work right in less than a month..."
5,Nice stuff,"These headphones are a great value, the input and output is great. The only problem is the plastic that wraps around the ears cuts into my ears. To combat this problem I wrapped tape around the part that hurt and now there are no problems. I recommend this product."
5,"Great, for its price","I'm a casual gamer and daily computer-user. The audio quality is fine, and the microphone works great. I wear glasses, and I have to say that it doesn't always cut into my ears. It depends on how you position the headset. I've had no problems with it so far."
2,Not structurally sound.,"The door of my PC case closed on the wire, and almost severed it. I admit this was my fault, however I would think it should be just a little more rugged than that. My friends said the sound quality through Ventrillo was terrible (they frequently asked me to repeat myself at many different volume settings), before and after the cord issue. Additionally I too had issue with my glasses, and the headset not being comfortable. I ended up having to go to a store and buy a different headset to replace this one."
1,Read Carefully,I bought this headset for what it was. When I got it-- and wore it-- it made my ears hurt the way it's worn.I'm saying this: I'm not wearing it wrong and it makes my ears hurt. I'm disappointed with this product; they could have produced something a little more ergonomic.
4,Great for the price,"I use this headset with Ventrillo so I talk talk with guildmates playing WoW.Pros: Comfortable for long gaming sessions, Quality of sound reception is clear, very little to no background noise, mute switchCons: Covers both ears so so muffles computer speaker system, mic on the left side so cord drapes across chest unless computer is to the left of the desk (great for southpaws!),gets in the way of glasses(kind of but not really, the least of worries)Over all, great headset! I have been very satisfied with what I got and recommend it. I would say though, don't pick it up from Amazon directly, the third party vendors affiliated with Amazon offer a better price."
2,"Works well, but lacks a shelf life.","The Logitech Extreme PC Gaming Headset is a fairly cheap headset. It works well for what it needs to do, but it also doesn't have a shelf life. What I mean by this, is you can expect to see it fail after 6-12 months of use. I had about seven of these headsets and I've since stopped using them after they all failed within a year.I'd recommend it for a casual gamer, but for nothing else. This isn't the kind of headset you can use daily and expect to still work."
2,Microphone is pretty much useless.,"The sound on the headphone is decent, especially considering the price.However, I've been trying to use these with Ventrilo and other voice-chat programs and the microphone is barely audible. I've turned up all the microphone settings both in the system control panel and on my sound card's control panel without any luck. No-one can understand what I am saying unless I really shout into the microphone and even then only occasionally.I tried to see if Logitech's website had any hints but they don't list this product on their site. In fact, it looks like they're trying to pretend they never made this sorry excuse for a microphone headset.If you want to listen only, these are probably fine. However, if you want to be able to use the microphone, you shouldn't consider this product. Choose something where the company's website AT LEAST admits the product exists."
2,Uncomfortable,"I was looking for a headset to use with skype. The sound quality of this headset was great. However, after about 30 min of wear, the fit was quite uncomfortable and the minimal adjustments it allows didn't make it any better."
3,"Decent, but not great.","The headset is okay, but that's all I'll give it. The speaker volume does not go up very high at all, which is one of my two problems with it. Also, the thing just isn't very comfortable to wear for an extended period of time (say..an hour?). I'll end up replacing this soon enough. On the bright side the microphone works nicely, doesn't pick up a ton of background noise either. Although, people on skype do say I sound a bit ""electronic""."
5,Awsome Headset,"Ive had about 5 headsets before this one and none were as good as this one. I am pretty rough on my headset and its holding up very well. As for glasses, i wear them and i found that i had an easier time adjusting to them because of the fact that i was used to something sitting on my ears. It is uncomfortable for the first week you wear it but your ears strengthen and they feel just fine. Just be careful you dont forget the Microphone's placement...ive done that while eating and it ruined the covering over the nicrophone. other then that this headset rocks out loud"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS-- 3 times microphone stopped working,"My boyfriend bought two of these headsets for us to use as a V-day gift. We got them on the 15th of February, and today is the 23rd. My microphone stopped working on the 18th, and Amazon sent me a replacement headset. My boyfriend's microphone stopped working on the 21st, and my NEW headset's microphone just stopped working today.Honestly? If it's not a mouse, don't buy anything from Logitech."
3,"Functional, but may be painful.",This set works as advertised. The sound quality is probably what you'd expect from headphones at this price - not a lot of lows but overall pretty clear. My main complaint is that after a relatively short period of wear this set can be fairly painful where the plastic piece sits between your head and ear. Your mileage on this may vary. Good performance for a cheap headset as long as you can wear it comfortably. This headset is NOT USB.
2,Will not work with PS2!!!!!,"I bought this headset after doing a search under ""USB Headset"" this device popped up...so I assumed of course it was usb...it is not, it has standard pc jacks!!! This was disappointing enough, but I set out to find an adapter that would make it into a usb headset...after buying a separate headset just get the adapter, it still would not work with a PS2...nor did the new headset...Do not buy this headset if you want to use it with anything other a PC..."
2,good stuff... [not actually so on re-reviewing after longer use],"Bought in October 2006.Performance wise the headset is definitely worth its cost and more...but i do find the headphones a little uncomfortable around the ear as my ears begin to pain in a while of wearing the headphones... my friend who bought the same thing with me finds it comfortable though.Barring this problem (which actually is quite critical), i think it is a great product worth more than the price amazon is offering it at. - 3 stars[On re-reviewing on 10/20/08 I would give this only a 2 star out of 5, though I am not able to change my previous rating. Please see comments to this review for reasons].And further, if you read my comment to this post, the mic went off in time as well.Not the most durable product for sure."
2,Breaks Easily,"Sound quality is normal , mic quality is on the lacking side , as for the quality , it just breaks easily , it will stop working all of a sudden and you have to send it in , usually it's the right 'phone that stop's working or has static , lasted for about 6 months for me :("
1,was stained!!!,"The shipping process was great, price was great, but I did not open it as soon as it came and gave it as a gift and was humiliated....it was stained! And very thin. Looks cheap. I had ordered an Irish flag had no problems so I assumed to just hand over the flag without looking at it. Talk about an embarrassing moment. Very unsatisfied!"
4,A good account of the war,"As usual, Osprey describes war histories in a very effective way. This book is ideal for anyone who wants to have a neat idea of what happened in Falkland/Malvinas in 1982."
4,the replacement works,"I got the screen but at first it doesnt retract at all. the worse thing is that the screen fell out of the enclosure within 2 days. luckily I bought it from amazon so I got a replacement within a few days.the replacement works perfectly, I can easily retract it completely . I bought the cheap optoma ep716, so this is more than enough for the SVGA projector.the result is pretty bright and clear picture and I am happy with it. I only give it 4 star since it failed me once."
3,Functions.,"The screen functions as promised, however it is very difficult to retract the screen. The instruction page to setup the screen is less than a waste of paper. They show this neat setup were you can have the screen flush to your celing, however they never tell you how or provide screws for it. Another thing that is less than steller is the shipping. In recieving this product it came dented and the box was torn to shreads. Of course, no one could do anything about. So just be aware. If you need a screen it is okay as long as you can live with the ""shipping"" defects."
1,Better off paying OPTOMA the extra $30 bucks,"The product I got was sold as ""NEW"" condition, but it came in a previously opened retaped box. When I opened the product, it was immediately apparent that it was used and broken. My first purchase online... might be my last!"
4,"In French it's ""Vertige du Desir""","Another Harlequin story written like something from the letters section of an 'adult' magazine. Rather mechanical but competently executed. The bedroom scenes offer examples of cultural difference between French and American ideas of erotic contact, though I don't expect any real need for this vocabulary. While I'd probably rate this a two-star trashy novel in English, as a tool to learn French it's motivating and offers something of a cultural reward."
4,Sometimes less is more.,"This book was compelling reading, but I was a bit upset with the ending. I was not happy with the intensity of the final tragedy,which seemed like just one too many. I guess I felt that the book could have comfortably ended thirty pages before it did. However, I was amazed by the technical information about how hearts work and about how hearts are transplanted. The author must have done an enormous amount of studying to explain all of that so well. All in all, this was a wonderful story of the importance of love and dedication of the heart."
4,A Great Book,I enjoyed this book more than any I have read. It had everything someone would love in a book without sexual scenes and vulgarity and a very happy ending.
5,When Crickets Cry,"I read a lot and this is one of the best books I have ever read. It's spiritual without being ""religious"". I intend to read all of Charles Martin's books. I would rate this book as excellent.Barbara MyersPetal, MS"
5,"Well written, thought provoking","I don't enjoy reading a book, even a novel, written by a writer who does not appreciate language. I also don't like reading a book which does not make me think about issues. This book is both well-written and has situations that made me consider what I would or should do in similar situations. Charles Martin is a southern writer who brings the best of southern writing to his books. I would encourage you to read all of them.The Dead Don't DanceMaggie: The Sequel to The Dead Don't DanceWhen Crickets Cry"
3,Disappointment,I must say some people must have enjoyed the novel. In my case it was rather a tedious book to get through. The novel is about a surgeon (Reese) that hides away letting no one he knows where he is except brother in law Charlie. He meets a young girl Annie that has heart problem and her aunt and that is what the story revolves around.I thought there was too many flashbacks to when he was a surgeon and his deceased wife. Too many details that did not add to story. I tended to skip ove quite a bit and I did manage to finish the novel which gives it a 3 star minimum. Most books i start to read I never finish.This book was sort of dreary and really not worth the time to read it.
3,when crickets cry,"I was disappointed in this book. I had a hard time ""getting"" into it, in fact I stopped reading it after about 1/3 of the book. It just didn't capture my interest"
4,Good Read,Interesting twist in the lives of the characters makes for a very interesting read. Definitely worth adding to your library.
1,disappointed,"I agree that the descriptive overkill really slows down the narrative. I know Charles Martin is talented by having read his other books, but this one was different. I felt Martin was maybe trying to hard to pull on the reader's heartstrings. I remember I guffawed out loud at a scene that was unintentionally funny where a child is hit by a car. I won't judge Martin by this book alone though."
2,If you can't end a book don't start one,"This book was an interesting, captivating page turner and I could hardly wait to find out the ending. Unfortunately the ending was a confusing,unrewarding, empty let down that pretty much turned reading the bookinto a exercise in futility. I would not recommend this book to anyonewho does a lot of reading. The best book I've read this year is Peace Like a River. Outstanding!"
3,when crickets cry,"This is one warm, ""fuzzy"" wonderful book. I have chosen it for our book clubs Nov.06 book to review. My only wish is that there would be a reader's guide that I could follow to help facillitate this get- together.I thought November would be a perfect time for reading this book as it give a great feeling for compassion, sacrifice, christian values and love for others. Nice positive way to end the year for your book club too!"
3,Nice Hallmark Story,Very well written. Great Hallmark Movie kind of story. Easy reading but not one of those I just could not put down.
4,A good read,I found this book to be very interesting. I love the characters Mr. Martin creates. Some find this author overly descriptive but I love what he does with words. This is my third Martin book in a week. I just found him the other day when reading reviews on another book and his name was mentioned. I plan on reading all his works.
4,Syd's Opinion,"I liked this book, and I didn't like this book. I liked the author's views on pornography--I totally agreed with him. I loved the way the little girl prayed, and the importance that the author put on our relationship with God, and that in the end, God is really the one calling the shots. I loved the love story of the doctor and his wife--the fact that it lasted literally a lifetime. I loved the doctor and the fact that he gave his whole life away trying to help others. I loved the way the story was arranged and how he kept me guessing. On the other hand, I was a little confused by the chapter when the little girl ""died."" I didn't know what happened--I went back and read it several times to see if I had missed something. I had hoped for a little romance between the aunt and the doctor, but that story line was left hanging. I would like to read more of his books. Anybody know a good one?"
5,Fantastic,This book was wonderful! I could not put it down at times and was so disappointed for it to end! Charles Martin has become my new favorite author.
5,A great Author,"I enjoyed this book, Charles Martin always turns out a good story, I am looking forward to the new one coming out."
5,WOW,This was the first book I had read by Charles Martin. It was so amazing I had to read more of his work. I was not disappointed they are all great!
1,Incomplete Book,Very disappointed - book had repeated pages from page 118 to 151. Had to go to local library to be able to read complete book! Wouldn't buy from this person again!!
2,When Crickets Cry,"Don't know what happened to the Kindle version, but it is a mess. At the beginning of each chapter, it skipped to unrelated text for a paragraph, then went back to the flow of the story. These were not lovable people for me. Cindy is a taker, latching onto a stranger. She apparently wore out everyone in town, leaving no one to drive her around - not one friend. And why the tornado?"
3,"Good, but cliche character spoiled it a bit","This author is obviously very talented. The book was dark and depressing so I can't exactly say that I enjoyed reading it, but it had it's moments of beauty. The only thing I absolutely hated about it was that the character of Annie was very poorly done. She was just too unrealistic to be believable. Small children in real life are not perfectly angelic, trusting, perceptive, thoughtful, unselfish, empathetic and wise. It's annoyingly cliche when authors pull out a child character named ""Timmy"" or ""Annie"" who is there for the sole purpose of pulling on our heartstrings with their angelic innocence. You just can't love a character who is so fake. That being said, the character of Reese and Charlie were fantastic and I loved the dynamic between them. The medical detail was also outstanding and made the book a fascinating read. If only that darn Annie hadn't ruined it."
4,You must try this book!,"It's categorized as Christian fiction. I don't normally read alot of Christian fiction, however I'm making my way thru every one of Martin's books! It doesn't focus on religion; just makes you aware of the power of faith. It's a wonderful read no matter what faith you are and you'll come to love every character in the book. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I thought the beginning was a little slow and the coincidences a little steep. Also, I loved my first Martin read, Wrapped in Rain, so much I may be unfair by expecting perfection from this author at every turn. He's not far from it! An amazing writer."
5,Outstanding novel!,"Charles Martin is an extremely talented writer. This story is amazing, heartfelt, surprising, and inspirational. A true page-turner and must read for any novel enthusiast."
3,when crickets cry,"I was very disappointed in several factors on this book: First it was too stretched out...went on and on to the point of bordom. second: the ending was too short and unexplained. How the last minute finding was unrealistic. He spent all his life studying for his wife's benefit and then making the decision he did when he constantly stated she was serious. and finally the very end was ""that's all folks"". Did he have a deadline to keep? Just can't figure out the end. Doesn't make sense."
4,Touching Story,"I really did enjoy this book, it brought some flawed humans together and showed us their struggles in an unusual story."
4,A Rollercoaster of Emotions,"This lovely story is simply a good read. This is a great story to share or get for someone dealing with life-threatening or terminal illness, as it shows how to live life to the fullest every day. It also shows the tough road that those who care endure. The ending had so many twists that I almost quit reading when I didn't like the outcome. But I'm glad I forged on to the end."
4,"Johnny Rutherford, Indy Champ","The author looks at 3-time Indinapolis 500 Johnny Rutherford. Like most of the books by Hal Higdon, this tends to be book geared toward elementary children not adults. Even still, this is good but not mandatory book to have in one's Indianapolis 500 memorabilia collection."
5,2 Gal Ziploc Heafty Jumbo Bags,"I bought these 2 gal. size Ziploc heafty jumbo bags to place a camera in . When outdoors in cold weather with a camera , you risk extreme condensation on the inside parts of your camera/camcorder etc. when moving back into a warm environment. This will cause rust and eventually ruin an expensive camera. The two gal Ziplock Heafty Jumbo bag is large enough to place your camera in, seal the bag, then when you move back into the warmth of inside your home in has time to acclimate slowly with no rust/condensation . After 30 minutes or so you simply remove the camera from the bag and you're good to go !"
2,Tears easily,The title says it all. I bought these to store pizza crusts in the freezer. I have already torn one just getting it out of the freezer. I wasn't yanking on it but now i know to be very careful. The size is great though.
1,horrible customer service,"I had purchased six boxes of these bags for some large bullysticks for my dog. Every bag in every box had small pinholes in them (before loading them up). So I called their service department thinking this was a batch problem. They told me that the most they could do was to send me a coupon for one free product. A few months later, nada. So I called them again. They said they would send the coupon out (having no record of our earlier chat). A few months later, nada. I gave up, as I don't have hours to spend on hold for nothing.I know these are STORAGE bags, but I noticed on some reviews some people were using them for freezer use. They are much too thin for that, BUT if you are going to do that anyway, do checks for pinholes first!"
3,"ziploc, but no zipper","I forgot they madfe this type of storage bag without a zipper, being visually impaired these are a little hard to ""get started"" and then I have to go squeeze end to end several times to ensure a good seal"
2,"Not an air tight, space saver bag!","Plastic is too thin. Tried using one as a space saver, air tight bag for a down jacket. Worked great the first few min. until it started letting air back in."
1,A lot of soup.,"Don't waste your money.Not so much beans.Mainly a cup of broth. No substance, just wanna be.Just pass."
3,Nile Black Bean Soup,This soup is okay. I expected more from reading reviews prior to me purchasing. Has a good amount of spice but I was expecting more whole black beans instead of black bean pieces. I followed the directions correctly and still find that the soup doesnt mix/settle well.
2,Pretty gross,"I love the pea soup, it's delicious. This is something I won't eat unless I absolutely have to. It has a black brant taste for an instant before fading to a cardboard flavor. 2/5 buying more split pea next time."
5,It's a bit 2 farty,This product needs a warning label due to the high amount of fiber. It cleaned me out.
2,"If the salt were separate, it would be 3 stars.","I just got this and the similar product from Dr. McDougall's which has the salt and spices in a separate 'flavor packet' but otherwise is somewhat similar. I do not like the fact that this product has all the salt (a lot of it) and spices mixed into the dry ingredients so you have no way to avoid it. I would give this 3 stars if it did not have all the salt pre-mixed into it. They should follow the example of the other company and keep the salt package separate. If you are looking for a low salt diet, this is not any good at all."
2,Rock-like Beans & Thin Flavor,I bought the Black Beans & Minestrone Soup cups for the auto-repair shop I work at. There's 22 guys & the ones who tried the two flavors I bought - didn't get it again. I'm a huge Black Beans & Rice fan but this brand was a bust.I found the beans and/or pasta bits stayed hard and the flavor was thin and dull. Huge disappointment & tough to get rid of the last few cups (except to the unsuspecting).
1,McDonald was once so good...,"Gregory McDonald once wrote funny, interesting books. The Flynn series was unique, and the early Fletch books were great. His skills seem to have deteriorated, and his last three or four books have been eminently forgettable. Sad."
1,Cheap,"Seahawks started to come off in the first week. The wheel cover is fine, but I bought it for the seahawks logo. I'd say do not buy."
1,not worth the money,item is not worth the money went to put it on standard steering wheel and cover tore in in half
3,"fine, but not great quality","This is a fine cutlery tray, but not as nice as the similar one made by Henkel. It is also on the small side"
5,Written specifically for novice authors aspiring to create,"Things Feigned Or Imagined is an insightful collection of tips, tricks, techniques and advice by career writer Fred Stenson and written specifically for novice authors aspiring to create truly imaginative fiction. Individual chapters informatively address just how characterization drives the story, how to quickly hook the reader, how to make effective use of humor, and so much more. An excellent supplementary resource for fiction writers everywhere, Things Feigned Or Imagined is a very strongly recommended addition to any personal, professional, academic, or community library Writing/Publishing reference collection or reading list."
3,John Nemerovski MyMac.com Book Review,"Here we have dozens of well-illustrated examples of techniques and tools built into version 1 of Photoshop Elements, with basic instructions on how to use them. Elements is one of the best beginner/intermediate applications of all time.Ironically, the software is so powerful and versatile that this colorful ""Teach Yourself Visually"" format can be a bit sketchy when readers need more details. If you work through the lessons and dig deeper within Elements, all will eventually be revealed. Experiment!Teach Yourself Visually Adobe Photoshop Elements is therefore a ""tip of iceberg"" guidebook, assisting newcomers to feel comfy with Elements, and then by necessity encouraging them to be creative with the thousands of possibilities that this application contains. Repetition breeds understanding, especially when working with digital imagery.Best suited to new users who learn via high-quality visual instruction.MacMice Rating: 3 out of 5John Nemerovski"
1,"Pretty Pictures, But . . .","I spent a couple of hours today in a hospital waiting room reading this book and came to this conclusion:Mike Wooldridge and his family spent a lot of time putting the graphics together for this book, but not enough in writing and copy editing. There are better books that give more fulsome instruction., so look at some of the others and let this one just lie there, colorfully.The one I am reading right now, one of the Dummies books, is better for my purposes. And maybe for yours, too."
3,Renaissance thought,"Kristeller is rather well known for his work on the origins of Renaissance thought. This work, regarded as a popular classic on the subject is geared towards a wide audience, made from several lectures given to a university audience. However, it can seem a bit boring at times. If you are looking for an introductory work on the subject, this is it. I will warn you, you will need to push yourself through the some occasionally complex subject matter at certain points (particularly in the section on scholasticism). Nevertheless, for an intelligent reader, it is the best introductory text, despite any shortcomings."
5,melodic to the bone,"one of the last years trance anthems...the music starts of with a mellow tone of a guitar and goes into a light bassline. Her voice sounds like a ancient chant that brings this track to maximun peek, the guitars bring in the sense of the Ibiza like feeling. A total must get..."
5,Best for fundmentals,"I have been a Expert player for quite a while (10+years) and I'm now taking the path to a IM. I decided to start all over and boy am I glad I chose Seirawan's book! Unlike several other of books out there, one can see immediate results applying the fundamentals described (in a lucid way) in this book. And considering the cost (which is less than cost of a dinner!), the payback is simply huge. My congratulations to the Seirawan/Silman team..."
5,OUTRAGEOUS,"SIMPLY IS ONE OF THE BEST CHESS'BOOKS I HAVE READENEVER EVER!!!!!!!!!Steven MonarrezTorreon Coah, Mexico"
2,pathetic books,honestly i dont recommend this books instead go for the classics they can be better or the pandolfini books as basic introduction
1,Save your money,"This was my first purchase of food from Amazon, or as the website refers to them, grocery items, and overall it was a disappointment. I love chicken tortilla soup, but every can in this shrink-wrapped 12-pack was dented. The soup itself was a forgettable concoction with undercooked beans whose skins had separated and chewed like wood splinters and there was a noticable absence of chicken. I definitely will not reorder."
5,I Like This Set!,"This is a good workout, and I enjoy using the belt. It is a different variation of Leslie's other work-outs. I have read that the belt breaks so I am waiting to see how long mine will hold out. I can tell that I am getting a good cardio work-out. I have only used this for 2 weeks and so I am waiting to see how much improvement in my abs that I might see."
3,Belt moves too much,I like the intenseness of the workout except the belt keeps moving too much. I find myself always readjusting it. In the video the belt never moves on the girls. I just find that strange. I have several friend how have tried this and they all say the belt moves.
5,Great tapes,"I got this set as a gift and started as part of my New Year's resolution. I have lots of other exercise tapes BUT I use this set. It is hard to get started on a lot of exercise tapes but this set is different. The moves aren't so hard that you never feel like doing the tape again. I have started other tapes and got a few minutes into the tape only to say this is too hard. This is good for people of varying levels of fitness. If you aren't in good shape, you start with the 1 mile and do what you can and build up your endurance. If you are in pretty good shape then you use the 2 & 3 mile tapes most of the time. I have recommended these tapes to friends and would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants to lose weight and improve their body. I have lost 12 pounds in 7 weeks by using these tapes and trying to improve my eating habits. The exercise belt really gives a good upper body & ab workout."
4,Great Tape Set! Buy the Power belt if your belt breaks!,"This is a wonderful tape series. Due to bad knees, I can't work out on a treadmill nor can I walk or run on a track or pavement - but, I can easily do this workout! I love the pacing, the music is nice but I find that the belt is not powerful enough for me. I'm afraid that if I tighten it too much, it will snap and break. Instead, I use the Powerbelt (I think it is by Kathy Smith - order from Walkers Warehouse) The Powerbelt fits better - does not ride up while exercising and comes with different resistance packs. It is pricey (about $65.00) but is very well made and will last forever!"
4,"Good video, bad belt","A good set of tapes to get back into exercise. The first tape provides an easy way to get moving if you have been sedentary for a while. The second tape moves it up a notch and you will get a good workout. The steps are easy to follow but you'll work up a sweat. The third one will get your heart pumping too, for 45 minutes. All three tapes lack a good cool down - I find myself needing to stretch after the tape is over. The ab belt is basically an overgrown rubberband. The idea of resistance is a good one, but I am afraid the belt is too cheaply made to really do the trick. I keep wondering if I can replace the band somehow with a bungi cord or something! Overall, I like the videos and use them regularly as an alternate for actually walking outdoors when the weather is bad."
1,Don't waste your time or money,This video does not work. The belt breaks and you will not be able to get a replacement or your money back. My belt snapped and injured me and I've tried for 8 months to get a replacement or my money back. Lot's of promises no follow through. I have been very frustrated with not even being able to use the videos that sit on my shelf because I do not have the belt.
2,Bad Company -- OK Product,"I bought this product in June 2002. Within 3 weeks of use, the band attached to the belt broke. I tried the internet -- where I bought it, and was told to call. I called and was assured that within 2 weeks I'd have a replacement. After a lot more communication -- still no replacement.You roll the dice you take you chance."
3,What's with the belt???,"I have almost all of Leslie Sansone's tapes. This by far is the poorest one; only because of the belt. I choose to do these workouts without it. The belt hinders my movements. The videos are wonderful and the exercises can be completed without the belt. All of her tapes do a wonderful job of targeting total body fitness. Save your money and put it towards her new series ""Walk away the pounds express."""
5,GREAT WORKOUT,"She's done it again, Leslie has put together another GREAT walking work out. I was sceptical about the ab belt but it Works, I have noticed a huge difference in my waistline and abs in just a couple of weeks. I highly recommend this set."
4,Making the Belt Last Forever!,"I too broke the walkaway belt in the first few weeks of use. So I replaced the blue stretchy cords that came with it with that rubber surgical tubing [the kind they use to tie around your arm when they're going to take blood] which is available at any medical supply place for about 15 a foot. I haven't had that tubing break in over a year of daily use, but if it did, I'd buy more. The belt and handles themselves should last a very long time. The tapes are great, and if they used that tubing instead of the rubber cord that comes on the belt, I'd give six stars!"
2,The belt! A goofball sales gimmick!,"Leslie Sansone is the queen of in-home walking. Some of her walking tapes are great, that is some! But since her entire regime involves walking, there isn't much else to do but create more walking videos, right? So, how do you sell more videos about walking, plain old walking??? I know! Add goofball gimmicks, like a belt with cheap bands. Come on now, how ridiculous is this?The belts have very weak rubber bands. They don't support the strain of pulling; they break easily. Once broke, the set is worthless.Also, the music is horrible! It's noise!The walking is low impact, including her powerwalking 3 miles tape. It isn't strenuous. If you want to lose weight, get walking outside! And skip this nonsense collection with a belt!! If you need to use resistance or weights, use small hand weights or get a couple of cans from the cupboard!"
3,"3/16""= 1/4""?",I know that plywood is undersized but 25% is a little rediculous would'nt you say? At least I hadn't made the rabbitts yet.
3,Fluorescent Yellow,"This fun and rare item is fluorescent yellow and takes awhile to charge. It doesn't look like a glow-in-the-dark but it is. When charged it glows nice and bright, but not for very long."
5,Track List,"Track List01Concerto Per Pianoforte E Orchestra N. 20 In Re Minore KV 466 - Allegro W. A. Mozart -02Concerto Per Pianoforte E Orchestra N. 20 In Re Minore KV 466 - Romanza W. A.

5,Terrific deal!,"The speakers arrived promptly and I was very pleasantly surprised to see a 50 foot spool or decent speaker cable included complimentary from Kingzad! This is above and beyond what anyone would expect. When I hooked them up to my amp I was even more pleased as the speaker sound terrific. They would rival high-end gear in the $250 to $500 range. I chucked my Sony bookshelves in the trash (actually, I gave them to my brother). These speakers are a steal at the price I paid ($50). They are quality hi fi (I've got a $6,000 home hi fi system, so I know). Highly recommended: both the product and the seller! Bravo Kingzad!!!"
3,Bumped off again.,"It would appear that Amazon has a policy to bump people off who have pending order if it does not make them a profit. Although the same item is showing available on the website. This is dispite a wait period of over 2 months. Cannot rate the item since it was not delivered by amazon.Stay away from AMAZON, they do not appear to be transparent in their dealings."
3,A little outdated and too big in size,"Most of the pictures seem to be from the 80's so it brings a lot of memories, but the book is too big (in size) for a toddler and there is no story line just pictures with big and small objects."
5,great for teaching language and concepts,I am a speech language pathologist and love this book. Not only has my toddler enjoyed but I have also found it a great tool to use to teach various language concepts to children with disabilities. The photos are clear and uncluttered. Not only can you discuss size concepts but many pictures allow for discussion of spatial concepts and simple noun + verb sentences. Great book for younger typically developing children as well as any other child with a language delay!
5,A very inspiring read,"Revolutionary Rehearsals, edited by Colin Barker, is the most inspiring book I have read in a long time. As the editorial review explains this book covers five major working class uprisings that have taken place in the last 50 years. These were all very inspiring accounts of every day working people standing up and fighting for a better world where they could be in control of their own lives. There are exciting quotes from personal accounts of people taking control of their workplaces and people taking control of large estates that were once used for one rich person's leisure, and now used to meet the needs of society as a whole. This book can be looked at not only as an inspiring account but also as a source of ideas on how change can happen. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those who want a better world but have doubts as to the possibility of it happening. Doubt no more!"
5,Very Nice!!,"Much better than the Aneros. Does exactly what a prostate massager is supposed to do. Withen 2 minutes after insertion I had cum dripping out of my penis without it being touched. The vibrations feel very nice, and with 4 speeds it covers all the ranges. It is comfotable for the first timer. I highly recommend it over the Aneros."
2,Not what I was expecting,"The Mens Pleasure Wand is small which made inserting really easy. It fit Snug which made for handsfree. The only thing it didn't do is actually hit the prostate. The Pleasure Wand has a really strong quiet vibration which makes you sphincters vibrate which is a good sensation. Before i got my Pleasure Wand, i thought the body of it would be soft but when i got it and held it, the plastic is really hard. The Device looks as if the vibrator is just a normal bullet with a control, molded into a men's prostate toy. Over all for it being advertised as a prostate massager, it didn't satisfy the job for me. The good side of this is that its inexpensive, ships fast, and arrives discretly. shipped within 4 days of my order date, love the fast delivery, if only the device can deliver what its promise to do.On a sidenote i have only used it once, i will use it again to see if results change and i will add more information."
3,Not what I was expecting,"It was not what I expected. Combersome to use, and I did not get the stimulation that I thought I would get."
4,Love this,"Bought this for my husband and he loves it, his only complaint is that the vibrations are not that strong."
3,Disappointing,"I found this to be undersized. It is too short to hit the ""spot"" and when inserted the vibrations can hardly be felt."
3,Pleasure wand so so,I wasn't as impressed with this as maybe some other are it just didn't seem to do the trick as maybe someone elses product would
4,"This is the most sentimental and straightforward of all the Hamsun novel I've read, but it was still very enjoyable.","I especially liked the second half of the book. The plot is typical of Hamsun, featuring obsessive love, self-destructive behavior, and characters who try to deny the things that they want most and do the opposite of what they should do. However, the level of Hamsun's distinctive craziness (e.g., midgets, neuroses, nervous breakdowns, harelips, murder) is much more subdued in this novel."
4,Works Well,"My 3 year old granddaughters use these easily and have no spills. Keeps the paint brushes upright, helps take off a bit of the paint, and stors the paint well."
2,"Elementary, my dear","Honestly, I didn't finish this book. I didn't even get very far. It sounds wonderful, a book about some of the greatest Christian minds. It reads like a 4th-graders research paper. Muggeridge inserts so much of his own thoughts and experiences its almost like we're reading his biography. His bios of these brilliant men are muddled, not described chronologically or in any other apparent order. If you want a VERY basic overview of these men, maybe this book is for you. If you actually have the intelligence to read anything written by any of them - this book is far beneath you."
2,barely scratches the surface,"The writers reviewed here in this work are great men of faith and explorers of truth. If you want to become mildly acquainted with these men, this is an ok start--but little more than an expanded wikipedia biography. These writers are worthy enough to be looked at directly, not through this sort of heavy filter. Go buy their books, not this one."
2,Do yourself a favor and try Sibelius 5 before buying Finale.,"I have been using Finale for several years and, while it is sufficient most of the time, I am constantly frustrated by how totally unintuitive it is. Even after going through tutorials and guidebooks, I still found it slow going. I finally got a copy of the new version of Sibelius and am just floored by how much better I like it. As a Mac user, I especially appreciate the ease and aesthetics of the Sibelius user interface. Plus, there are some Sibelius-specific features that are just really thoughtful (especially the Ideas palette -- great for sketching out compositions or saving alternative melodies). Music notation software is expensive: do yourself a favor and try both before committing."
4,Excellent Upgrade,"It's a great program for music writing. With multiple ways to input, the most realistic sounding midi system to date, and the ability to save files as mp3s or other audio formats, it's definitely the best on the market. I'd recommend it to any aspiring or professional musicians."
1,most un-user friendly music notation program,"Unbelievably hard to use. It takes forever to input notes, simple things like chord symbols are difficult to figure out, and figuring the layers part is impossible.Get Sibelius or wait until something better comes out. I can't describe how frustrated I feel after trying to use this program. The one good thing about Finale is that the notation looks clean and professional. Getting the notes on paper is a whole other story.This is a waste of my time."
2,Patriots Controller,Cheap product - quality is questionable. Second remote bought. First one broke after about one month!
2,Seller ***** quality*,"This is my 3rd set of jars with covers for Donivier Yogurt maker in 5 years. I have no problems with yogurt maker or jars, but covers!!! They keep cracking all the time no matter how gentle you are with them. I wish I could replace only those cheap covers but I have to purchase those expensive jars as well!!! I hope some day this company will became smarter and 1. improve the quality of the covers or 2. starts to sell those practically disposable covers separately for $2 a set!"
3,Good Yogurt - Bad Timer,Makes good yogurt however the timer is limited to 19 hours & 59 minutes. We do our yogurt for 24 hours which gretaly increase cultures and eliminates sugars. With this yogurt maker we must reset to go for the full 24 hours.
4,Yogurt maker extra cups,"I bought these at the same time as the yogurt maker to ensure I would have enough yogurt. I only wanted to make yogurt twice a week, and the extra cups enable me to do that (although now, my husband also wants to eat my yogurt). The only problem with the cups is the lids - they are difficult to remove when you are ready to consume the product. Screw lids might have been easier. But for the lids, I would have given this product 5 stars."
3,Ok CD,This is probably my favorite CD by The Blenders. There is always nice harmony but the selections and the arrangements are not always appealing to me.
3,"Good, but has outdated adoption language","I liked this book for it's straight forward approach, and down-to-earth language. Aimed at teenagers, it succeeds in being approachable. However, I was disappointed by the use of terms like ""natural parents,"" ""children of their own,"" and ""given away."" Those certainly aren't phrases that I use with my kids, and I was surprised to find them in a contemporary book on adoption, especially one designed to help adolescents with questions about their origins. I'd recommend reading it along with your child and using that language as another opportunity for discussion."
2,Very disappointing....,"I give this two stars because it does deal with difficult adoptions issues such as racism and for the organization of the material. However, as a librarian, I am appalled that my professional journals rated this so highly- I will never give this to anyone without making sure that they know there is offensive, outdated language in it. To hand this to a child who is dealing with adoption issues and not preparing them for passages such as ""some adopted kids just consider them"" (adoptive parents) ""their real parents"".... ""why she gave you away"" is cruel. I hope that future editions will have better editing so that the true value of the book is accessible. Overall, it is well written, organized and teen accessible....except for those passages that would be a slap in the face to the adoptee reading them. This is a book to be used by teens on their own. Unfortunately the poor translation/bad editing make it useless in that manner."
1,Better Units Available,"I am an outdoorsman and would not recommend this for several reasons.1. It is battery operated with no on/off switch! If in the woods for any period of time you must remove the battery to conserve and then reinsert and recalibrate. Ridiculous. Would be difficult in the rain, snow or very cold temperature or if dropped in the snow.2.Directions for setting this unit up is very cumbersome and you would have to carry the directions because they are so complicated. If you took battery out to conserve then it would have to be set up and recalibrated everytime. I know I can not remember which button to push and in what sequence.Plus side is it is easy to read and appears accurate."
1,Too complicated,"Auto off does not work, I have had to calibrate it several times in 2 weeks. All I wanted was a reasonably priced digital compass. The other bells and buzzers are worthless and make the unit confusing. The sale though Amazon was my first and handled very well. If it was a simple thing to return it I would. This survey wants me to rate the unit with 1 to 5 stars and does not give the option for ZERO.... So if you see one star, I had no choice."
3,worked pretty well,This worked pretty well for the price but I would not trust if my life depended on it. Thank You
5,perfection personified,"Maysa Leak is seductive. And not (just) in a carnal way. Her voice reaches out from each of the eleven tracks on ""Smooth Sailing"" to lead the listener on a journey into stylish R&B; tinged with jazz and soul.Maysa rose to fame as the featured vocalist in acid jazz ensemble Incognito, and her at least two of her previous solo albums bore the stamp of Cog leader Jean-Paul ""Bluey"" Maunick, directly or by influence. Not so this time. Maysa's signature sound is more progressive and modern than Incognito, while avoiding faddy hip-hop-esque production, though several tracks could make excellent rap samples.Picking a favorite track is nearly impossible, save for a half-hearted experiment with reggae beats on ""It's Time For Love,"" it's perfect modern R&B.; Neither neo-soul or thugged out cliches, ""Smooth Sailing"" is perfect. Just perfect."
3,Contemporary Aluminium Desk Lamp,"I loved the design and looked at the reviews that gave this item good rating. The item was purchased thru Amazon.com website but the seller was another company. Well, I always try to buy Amazon.com only but I had no choise this time. When the item arrived I noticed the packaging has some damages, the item was used (probably a returned item), the lamp would not stand and the screw that tighten the lamp was partly damaged (someone trying to make it work). So I received a returned item. I decided to return the lamp and did not want to buy a replacement."
4,Pretty good Greene,"Graham Greene actually manages to come up with a reasonably happy ending, bit of a shock, but then he doesn't delve so deeply into the human mind as in some of his other books.The story revolves around the attempt by one man to buy some coal, not much of a premise, but Greene manages to build up a fair level of tension in the story, and although the love interest side of the novel isn't that beleiveable, the emotions of the central character are brilliantly portrayed.Not as brilliant as some of his other work, but excellent reading on train into work material."
4,THE USUAL GRAHAM GREEN ATMOSPHERE,"Good book in line with other Graham's ones as The Third Man or Our Man in Havana. Nevertheless not so bright, intelligent and fun as Our Man in Havana."
4,A timeless page-turner,"Greene's work, although provinvial in the sense that they are terribly British (I don't always get what he is talking about), is a knockout! What great great writing! Really unbeatable travel reading ... don't hesitate..."
3,To long a wait,"It took entirely to long for this couple to get together . Typical story, baby brings couple together. I love Mrs. Jackson stories but this one wasn't all that."
4,just a very good book,I love Brenda Jackson and find her books very intriguing. She always has a mystery to go along with her books and adventure. I would recommend this book to the fans of Brenda Jackson and African American Romances.
3,disappointed,"it was love story that didn't have the same power that Brenda Jackson's other books have, and it didn't expand on the Cattleman's Club. It had a lot of loose ends and that's not like Brenda not to bring things together."
1,Braun MX2050 Bad gears,Bought this product Braun MX 2050 in Jan 08 and we are about replace the blade gear for the second time. We use it once a week to blend Icecream and frozen fruit. It does not seem to handle frozen items very well. We have contacted Braun to see if they'll send us a new Blade gear. It is costing us now more for the replacement parts than the Blender originally cost us.
3,Braun Blender,This blender performs as well as blenders costing twice as much. It is sturdily built and weighted so it stays put. The jug has a nicely shaped pour spout so pouring into glasses is easy without spilling it all over the counter. I studied a number of blenders before making the decision to buy this one and I feel I made the right choice.
5,Obviously Superior,"I just bought this blender. It is obviously better than all the blenders I grew up with. I have only needed to use the clean and the slowest setting on the blender, and I'm not sure it's as powerful as my wife's VitaMix, but unless you're a restaurant making bread with your blender, buy this one."
2,Purchase with Caution,I purchased this blender and it worked perfectly on the first try. I attempted to use it again yesterday and smelled burning plastic. It was not blending my strawberry and banana smoothie & I had not even used ice in it. I am not impressed with this product and am afraid to plug it in to see if it starts. I can not afford to have wasted $50 on this blender and also have my home burned down - all because I wanted a protein smoothie!
1,A Mess,"Apparently designed by retarded monkeys (smart ones could do better). The inner top does not cover the three notches where it fits in and twists. As a result, the liquid splashes up and out of the container every time you start it up more than 1/4 full. I returned this one."
2,Blade Gears break off rendering useless after short while,"I received my powermax blender in late August 2007, here it is about 3 months later and the flimsy plastic gears that attach the metal spinning blades to the motor in the base of the unit when you seat the blending jug have all but broken off. Admittedly I have been having frozen banana & frozen berry smoothies 4 or 5 days out of the week since purchase. I didn't think this was exceptionally hard work for this blender though, after all the frozen fruit was doused in about a cup of soymilk. I'd shop around for a different blender without such a flimsy part."
5,A Real Bargain!,"I am very pleased with my Braun MX2050 PowerMax Blender. It is packed with power, and quality features. I don't believe there is a better blender for the price."
2,Worked well for a while but then...,"CR rated this one highly so we went with it. It worked great at first but wore out after a year, even with light usage. I was disappointed."
2,Probably not worth the trouble,"Works well, breaks regularly. The motor is quite powerful, but the drive train is plastic and breaks. One can purchase replacement parts, but the third time you buy a ten dollar part you begin to question the total cost. And it may take several weeks to get the part.Not recommended"
3,"my review of braun blender powerMax 525 watt, 58 0z. jug blender.","One time I didn't have the blender in right , so it was vibrating and the rubber around the base was worn away and it was smeling like it was burning.But now I put the juj into the base , securely and everything is okSo all in all I think it's a great blender......................"
2,"Good, but not great","Nice looking blender, simple to operate and cleans up well. But while making smoothies it slows down to a grind and smells like the motor is burning up. I'm not confident it's going to last a month."
4,"BRAUN BLENDER, EXCELLENT VALUE!","Forget those foolish ""smoothie makers."" All you need is THIS! FYI, the Braun got excellent scores in Consumer Reports, EXTREMELY AFFORDABLE (< $50) and VERY easy to clean. Glass jug doesn't hold odors and is easy to rinse. Blade assembly comes completely off the jug, again easing the cleaning process. A pulse, low med high settings, that's all you need, anything else is just gimmicky!"
5,Still going strong 5 years later,"Bought this in November 2007. My wife makes smoothies with frozen fruit every morning using this blender. And she uses it a few times per month for cooking dinner.Easy to use, light enough for my wife to put in an overhead cabinet, and still going strong."
1,Quickly broke,"This couldn't hold up to ice, a common use for blenders. We were very disappointed in the short life of this."
2,Lasted three years,"I give it two stars because I had about three years where I liked it very well. I used it solely for grinding nuts into nut butters. All of a sudden, I put in some cashew nuts, and I noticed a funny smell. It wasn't working well either. I saw the nuts were burning! Fortunetely, there was no smoke or fire. It was no longer usable, so I just threw the unit in the trash.I'm still looking for something that is glass and made somewhere besides China. I may give a different Oster model a try."
4,Braun MX2050,Works well. Bought purely from Consumer Reports review. A little louder than expected but we'll see if it lasts as long as the Warings we've had over the years.
3,Great while it works!,"My first Braun MX2050 made great frozen-fruit smoothies and pesto until the attachment teeth broke. Braun apologized, acknowledged the problem, told me they had improved the part and replaced it at no charge. When the shaft began to just spin and not blend with any load, I checked CU's reviews again and bought a second Braun MX2050 at a good price from Amazon. It too worked beautifully. However, after only 13 months, some of the attachment teeth have broken and the shaft just spins and won't blend anything much thicker than water. Now I worry about whether I made a mistake buying them as gifts for my grown children. I'm tired of accumulating useless blender jars and am not about to give Braun a third chance."
1,You can have mine - don't waste your money,"I bought this blender because it got good reviews on Consumer Reports. It was quite a disappointment. First and foremost the machine is mostly plastic and very cheap looking. The only reason I bought this was for crushing ice in smoothies and bar drinks. I am out of luck unless I have 15 minutes to start and stop the machine, shake up the contents, swoosh it around, try again, and again, and again. I have found that the machine can not handle more than 3 ice cubes at a time (I've tried all combinations) and frozen fruit is out of the question. The fruit must be defrosted slightly in the microwave first. Wow - after writing this I realize how much I've become a slave to this piece of junk! If you're really interested in buying this one, come to my house and you can have mine. I'll be happy to have you take it off my hands."
2,"Worked fine for two weeks, then...",The blender arrived in great shape and worked very well for two weeks. It blended frozen fruit for smoothies quickly. Then one morning I made a shake for my wife and everything was fine. When I made one for myself there was a loud clanking and the blender no longer worked. I loved it until that moment. I returned it to Amazon for full refund.
2,I SO wanted to love this blender...,"I bought this because it was Consumer Reports ""Best Buy"" for blenders... a glitch CR says they originally encountered was supposedly remedied but it was the exact problem I had. The ""plastic gear-tooth assembly"" where the jug connects to the motor doesn't catch reliably - especially if I have ice cubes or frozen bananas in the blender - but that's the whole POINT of a blender. It goes from being this lovely, not noisy blender, to vibrating and literally moving all over my counter making a heinous sound. It quickly became nerve-racking to approach using it since I never knew how it would behave. Like a little time bomb on my counter that also makes smoothies... Suffice it to say, I'm returning it."
5,works well,This is a very nice blender... I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good quality blender. I purchased this blender to make slushies and it does a great job.
1,Planned Obsolescence???,"I would like to give this blender no stars but I am not allowed. I expected a Bruan product, which cost $45, to last longer than 5 months.I bought this blender in Dec 07 and it worked great for 5 months. I made numerous smoothies with milk, yogurt, bananas and frozen strawberries. Then one day the blender only had one extremely fast and rough speed. Two uses later, the blender died. The motor turns but the blades do not.I will quote Onur Usmen ""turkob"" who put this perfectly:""It seems my blender has succumbed to the same fate as many others have listed here: the plastic gears on the motor no longer catch the blade. I don't feel like hassling with sending this in for repairs, so it looks like I'll be buying a different blender. What a disappointment!""In closing let me say I will not be purchasing Braun appliances in the future."
1,Weak and Emits Toxic Smoke,"I researched this so carefully, really only wanting to make fruit smoothies faster and easier, and was I ever disappointed! I'm also disappointed that Amazon reviewed this so well. I wish I had not paid attention.When I try to make a smoothie with one ripe banana, five frozen strawberries, oj, and 3 ice cubes, the motor overheats (hot to touch), gives off toxic fumes and a little black smoke, and can't make the smoothie. I don't think that's too much to ask of a blender. I've been trying to make it work for about a year now, without success.The cheap plastic gear mechanism can't handle most jobs--I would only recommend this to someone who wants a nice container to mix their hot chocolate in."
1,Blades bind up repeatedly and the motor burned out...,"I tried to make this work but gave up after ordering replacement blade units over time. Switched over to the all-metal Oster Classic Blender with a two-throw toggle switch (KISS), and I'm pleased as punch!"
1,Very Disappointing,"This blender is not worth the money. It will not crush ice, and after a couple uses to make protein shakes, started to smell like burning rubber. Then it started to leak fluid. I expected a better product from Braun."
3,Broke within a week,"Great product, but the plastic gears that drive the blender started breaking teeth with in a couple weeks of purchase. It was used no more then 10 times for chooping fruit. I am refering to the grears that connect the blender to the base. Now I am trying to find replacement parts."
4,Nosferatu,"The production on this album is excellent. If you listen carefully at a loud level none of the music is lost every sound is maintained punchy and crystal clear. Best songs are the title track Nosferatu, Irate Caterpillar, Big Bug, Wired, Wrong Way Round and Puppets. Lesser tracks are Losers in a lost land, a poorer version of White Room and Rythmic Itch - hence only a 4 star rating, but still a mega album which if this had been a Stranglers album would have been a huge hit. The production is similar to the great Stranglers album Black and White."
4,Bristles may be too stiff,"Of course it's an individual thing, but my wife found the bristles on this brush too stiff and harsh to use on her back. I bought the brush for her at her request. I never use these things myself, so I cannot comment personally. On the palm of my hand the bristles seem soft enough. She needed a replacement for a similar brush no longer made.Just a heads up that others might find the brush too stiff to use. I gave the brush 4 stars because otherwise it seems like a good product. But the harshness is, of course, a deal breaker.She's going to buy a brush at a store so she can check the bristles first hand -- probably a good idea for anyone."
1,far reaching back brush,"the brush is not long enough to reach the middle of my back, never mind the ergonomic handle. i get pain in the wrists trying to reach the middle of my back. the brush bristles are fine;they hold soap. i should have measured but when the ad said far-reaching I thought it would be long enough. I ama six foot male with a wide back and average lenght arms so I would say the brush needs to be another 3"" to 4"" longer."
1,Very Poor Customer Service,"This company surprizes me with they're very poor customer service.When the brush head cracked, making it un-usable, all they would say is:"" It is not our problem.""I will not purchase from this seller again."
1,Earth Therapeutics brush is junk,Brush is made of wood and the head split after 1 use. Brush should be made of a water resistant material. Don't waste your money on this product.
2,"Nice back brush, but it's turning black with mold","I've used many back brushes over the years. This one is very nice and has very soft bristles. But the wood in the head of the brush is turning black with mold. Also turning black where the bristles attach to the brush. Gross. I've only had it about a month. I hang it in the same place as all the other brushes I've had, but no others have ever turned black."
3,Does the job!,This is much easier to use than throwing the wash cloth between my shoulder blades and working back and forth! I am average size and I think it would even work for a tall man.
1,Not good,The shaft on this brush is made of plastic and will break upon use. I do not recommend it. The brush would be much better if the shaft were made of wood.
4,Good back scrubber,"Great scrubber for your back, Just remember to keep it dry mine started to get dark since I take showers about twice a day not sure if it was mold or not."
1,Cheap product,This product lasted exactly 3 uses. The handle broke and the head is starting to crack.I would recommend spending a few more bucks and getting something that will last a least 3 days.Edit: To Amazons credit I was given a charge back.
1,Trash !!!,"After only TWO days hanging in the shower, the wooden head split open and the bristles began falling on the floor. The wood is very cheap so buy a plastic brush."
4,Great Exfoliante Brush,Therapeutics Far Reaching Bath Brush is the best in their line of bathing brushes.The upside: Lasts a long time. The downside: May crack (but did not break and is still usable). This is one of the nicest natural bristle bath brushes available and great for those hard to reach areas. Overall A sound buy. B+/A-JJ/-R
2,Poorly made,Had the brush for a week or so and the head has fallen off the handle already. Glued it back to together and seems fine now.
3,Skin brushing,This brush is perfect for skin brushing except the long handle. I cut it off and now the brush is a joy to use!
2,Cheap For A Reason,"I bought this brush just four months ago. Last week, the handle fell off. After seeing how it was attached, I'm surprised it lasted this long. There were just two tiny nails holding the handle to the brush, and those were so close together there may as well have only been one.Also, don't believe the product description that suggests the handle can be bent to the ""desired shape."" It's WOOD! It's evident whoever is trying to sell this hasn't even looked at their own product."
1,POOR QUALITY BATH BRUSH,The brush head came off the first time used. DO NOT BUY! I usually read reviews and apparently did not on this item. My Bad.
1,Bad product,Looks good but cracked after one use. Bristles falling out. contacted seller but no reply. Don't buy..
1,"Hmm, don't think it's supposed to do that...",During the very first use the head popped off the handle! Doesn't look like there was very much adhesive applied when it was put together so I'm going to try re-gluing. But having that happen right away was a real disappointment so I can't recommend this item.
3,Does the job well but...,"I've tried 2 of the 3 brushes pictured.The one with the strap attached: popped off the handle for me too after only a few uses. I just pushed it back into place but it still came out often till I got too fed up with it. I also found that the strap started growing some kind of mould. Not good at all. 2 starsI had much more success with the 2-sided one whcih has bristles on one side and a massager thingy on the other. It's much more sturdy, never came unglued and no scary mould growth. 4 stars"
1,Your CRACKED UP if you buy this!,"Purchased Far Reaching"" Back Brush with Ergonomic Grip Handle . Brush BROKE IN HALF within 6- weeks. Only used it about 9- times. Wouldn't purchase this DANGEROUS wooden edged product again."
4,Bristles ended up okay,Wasn't sure I'd like it because the bristles felt too stiff at first but after using it for a week they softened a bit and it works and feels great now. Handle is long enough and I like the little string so it can easily hang from a hook on in my shower.
2,Backbrush,The actual brush is good but they fall off after a few uses. We have found this common with any backbrush we have purchased. Now we just take the brush off and glue them on with crazy glue or liquid nails.
1,"Falls apart, limp bristles.","Head and handle seperated after just a few uses. Two pieces of wood wedged together, I don't even think they used glue, or at least weren't clever enough to use waterproof glue. The bristles were very soft too, not stiff enough for exfoliation or even a good back-scratching feeling."
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this brush with fairly low expectations. I assumed I would get a brush that would last for a few months at which time I would buy another one. This brush got wet one time and the next day the head of the brush split and several of the bristle inserts fell out. I decided I could deal with that, it was a cheap brush and it was still useable. After the second time the brush got wet the head of the brush fell off of the handle. My recommendation is to spend an extra $5 and buy a brush that is higher quality."
4,Nice back brush,"Really pretty, nicely crafted, and quite solidly made. I'd give it 5 stars if the bristles were just a little stiffer (they're fine, just a bit soft for me)."
5,"excellent quality!! Great buy!! Soft bristles, Nice!!!!!!",I was amazed at the quality of this back brush. The bristles are soft and it is very easy to reach the difficult areas on your back. Great value for the money!!!!
3,Dry skin brushing,I ordered this brush for dry skin brushing. It works very well and the handle is long enough to reach all over. The brush is firm enough to do the brushing but not so hard it hurts or damages the skinEarth Therapeutics Far Reaching Back Brush
3,back brush,"Yes, it is far reaching. But the bristles are rather short and not very stiff. Great for a woman, but not for a guy who likes a good strong scrub."
2,Back Brush,The Brush has excellent reach.However after only a few uses the wood is already starting to split.I dont know how long it will last
2,I Bought The Wrong Brush,I guess I didn't pay attention to the description because I wanted a body scrub brush. This brush is way too soft and light to be used for exfoliating the skin either wet or dry. I guess I misread the description.
2,Back Brush Far Reaching,"This brush was exactly what I was looking for! Imagine my disappointment when the very first time I used it, the handle broke in the area under the rubber grip! I tried gluing the handle, but that lasted for less than 1 use."
1,Yet another cheap product.,"This is yet another disappointment. I have purchased four back brushes in the last few months. Three have broken almost immediately. Each was made in China and, after close examination, they are made of very thin material under the rubbery grip. This one has not broken yet, but it is made in China and has very thin material under the grip (same location the others broke). The brush itself is rather nice, but the wood brush area split after the first use and bristles are beginning to fall out. I give it another week at most. I think Fuller, while very expensive, is probably the best value. Stores need to recognize the junk and stop pushing it to us as consumers. And we, as consumers, need to stand up and rebel against this type of garbage."
2,Good little brush for the cost... but breaks at the handle,"I purchased this brush 8/13/2010; for a brush costing less than $10 it was a good brush. This brush was used daily for a year (it broke 8/31/2011) till the handle broke at the end that you hold it at. I had no issues with the brush during the past year. Would I recommend it? Yeap - for the price. I'm actually getting another one as I write this review. UPDATE 2/12/2012 - Well the one I purchased in 9/2011 just broke - and get this - at the same spot as the last one. I really think this brush has a design flaw. I decided to get a diffrent brush this time, it's getting old having this brush break."
1,Mistake to buy it,"Within 4 days of first touching water, the wood at the base of the bristles showed fissures and cracks, and then began to turn black (mildew?). Clearly, this brush is not well-designed to cope with water, which is where the product is supposed to be used, unfortunately. It did not crack, but I did not use it long enough to get to that point. I could see how if it got much more warped, it would crack and you wouldn't be able to fit the removable brush head back onto the handle. Threw it away. I wonder if plastic brushes would do better. I would not recommend this product at all."
1,Poor product,First time I used brush head fell off. Would have re-glued it but stick end was warped. Definitely don't waste your money. Trash
3,It could use a few screws,"Yes. this correct. I had been using this brush for years now, but what I do is add to the back of the brush (3) 3/4 inch flathead aluminum screws. Very simple to install. This will keep the connection between the brush and handle in place. Glue by itself does not last. So, once your finished with the old brush , take off the screws from it, (they won't rust cause there aluminum)and install them on your new brush. So, stay clean , Retired Early"
3,Wonderfully Average Brush,"The bristles on this brush are wonderfully soft. They also wear out very quickly.I have used this brush for 2 months, and the center of the brush is already wearing out (I use it on my feet, too).I would like a brush with slightly stiffer bristles for both my back and my feet.The long handle is a big plus for taller people."
4,natural bristles,"This body brush has a nice long handle with good rubber grip. Like was mentioned in other reviews, mine cracked quite quickly but isn't that expected with a wood brush? To avid it cracking I would say not to leave it in the shower and make sure its dried off after use. Even though mine is cracked it still works great and I recommend it."
5,Great product for your money.,"I have worked with this product on several occations. However, I actually own Photoshop 7.0.I rate this item well because it is a great item for the money and is especially usefull to those who want to help their photos or add some effects to them, but don't know much of anything abouthow to do it. It works for many who don't need complete control over their images. You can get some cool effects with this product and even fix some color problems on your image or add text. This product is just a very toned down version of Photoshop. It is great for beginners who want to learn more about Photoshop, but can't afford the product yet. I recommend this item over ALL others of its type.I do not recommend this item to a professional digital imager who does this for a living because you need to go get the full version."
1,Frustrating Product,"I will never buy another Adobe Product. This program has a very steep learning curve. Once I got the hang of it I found that every time I want to use it I have to reinstall it, and it won't work if I don't let it call home for permission. This wastes a lot of time. Much as I hate to do so, I will go back to Microsoft."
4,Excellent product,"only stars off for being a little over my head at times, perhaps a little too powerful. But I'm able to undo just about anything, so eventually I get it, and it does a beautiful job."
5,Amazing Power - GREAT Value,"I stepped up to PSE2.0 about a year ago, after using Adobe's PhotoDeluxe for several years. PSE is an outstanding program, giving me the ""digital darkroom"" capabilities I'd been craving, at a fraction of the ""real"" Photoshop price. The key functions for me were Burn and Dodge, the ability to lighten or darken sections of a photo. The brightness/contrast controls are great, and the ""Levels"" function expands it even further! This has been everything I wanted, and lots more. I did invest in a 3rd party tutorial, which helped me learn even more capabilities. If you want great image editing capabilities without a $600 price tag, Elements is a great choice!"
3,Photoshop Elements 2 Don't Be Fooled,"I recently purchased Adobe Photoshope 2 and was very disappointed to find it only works if I load Mac 9.2 in the background. The specifications says it works with OSX, The product itself is as good as 3, but 3 works with OS X without any switching around"
4,Bottomline between Photoshop Elements and Photoshop,"Photoshop Elements is the right software for you (and save you lots of money) if all you want to do is work with photos.But if you're intending to use it to make a living and need more than photo editing, such as creating brochures or logos, than you would definitely need to get Photoshop."
3,Good enough,"Even though Adobe's support, pricing, and marketing practices leave quite a bit to be desired, I'd suggest anyone wanting to do some lightweight photo-editing use Elements. While it is far from perfect, it is much better than most of its comptetitors on either the Mac or Windows platforms.Excellent: Photoediting features.Good: File import/export capabilities, alternative input device support.Fair: User interface (needlessly complex).Poor: File browsing, documentation."
2,Good Software Bad Warranty,Even though Photoshop Elements 2.0 is good software I can onlygive it 2 stars due Adobe's lack of warranty and tech. supportthey give this product. The customer only gets 1 tech supportphone call issue; there after you will be charged $25 per new issue. The same applies for E-Mail issues. BUYER BEWARE! Adobecan be reached @ 1-800-833-6687.
5,Perfect for the intended application,I don't like paying for the extra features I don't need. I also refuse to move to windows 7 and this software perfectly fits the intended app - inexpensively.
5,WOW!,"I was looking all over ebay and everywhere for a [inexpensive] copy of photoshop and was unable to find one. Then I read about this and ordered it! It does EVERYTHING that I have always used photoshop for AND it has a bunch of *really* helpful interfaces.Very, very wonderful! Like 90% of the features for 15% of the cost!"
4,The best of Photoshop at a great price,"Have you ever had the urge to edit your photos or be creative with them? Have you wanted to get a hold of Photoshop but found it too expensive and you weren't sure you would like it or use it?Well, Photoshop Elements 2.0 is for you. It encompasses some of the best features from the full version at a fraction of the cost. It has automated features that do the work for you. It has tutorial hints and recipes that walk you through the processes of creativity.I own Photoshop 7.0 but got this because of the automated photo merge and other automated items. It will get you hooked on photo editing ~ You will love it!!"
3,Typical Adobe,"Lots and lots of features, but intended for a Mac, I guess. Do a ""Save As"" and your new pic/doc is still ""Untitled-1"". Close the app down and it prompts you to save everything you've already saved! Worse than that tho is the one-day guarantee. It's buggy, twice in one day I had to delete the preferences file to make it use the color I wanted. I was forced to upgrade from v1.1.... I bought a new 'puter and had downloaded (and BOUGHT, yes) v1.1 to the first one and had deleted the install file (duh) In the end however, I do use it quite a bit in my web business. Gif animations are limited to one frame(layer) rate, which PSE2 is unaware of when you reopen it. And if you save an un-animated gif, you lose your layers (unless there's some feature I haven't noticed!)"
1,Must be for the Pros,"This software is NOT easy to use. I am an average software user and generally learn quickly, but I can't figure out what is going on with this software without wasting a bunch of time reading user's manuals. The tools are not self-explanatory and I have yet to enhance a single photo. I usually end up closing the program and using Microsoft Picture It! Publishing, which is WAY more user friendly. If you are looking for an easy to use product to enhance your digital photos, I would NOT recommend this product. It must be for the pros..."
2,What a nightmare!,"I have an idea. Let's take a very powerful, professional level software, yank some expensive features and shove it down the throats of average users. As a user, I am very familiar with Photoshop and use it with some regularity. I find many of the concepts and interface parts of elemtns familiar. But this is being pushed on non-pros which is my problem. I have had to become an Adobe customer support person fro my family because this darn thing is too hard to learn and get used to. Support from Adobe is almost non existent so I continually answer questions and teach usage to my family members. I should have tried something easier!"
1,Very Difficult to Learn,"I found it very difficult to get through the operation of the layers function in this software. The information provided did not explain clearly how to establish a background layer that would allow me to resize and join two photos. Seems pretty simple, but it wasn't. I wouldn't recommend buying this software without taking a class to learn how to use it."
1,Don't expect that rebate,"Please note before you buy that in order to get the [] advertised rebate, you must already own a previous version of Adobe Photoshop you must supply the serial number of your PREVIOUS version. Adobe does not base this rebate on the fact that you bought their new version -- you have to already own the old version AND buy the new version. You will have a hard time finding out this little detail until after you have already made the purchase -- BUYER BEWARE!"
1,"It said it was easy to use, Picture It Deluxe is easier!!","I work with many picture programs, this one is not as easy as what was said. It was suppose to be campatible with Windows XP but this will not work in my computer because they had to unplug the twain in order to get it installed. I had trouble from the day I tried to install it. Can't use my scanner or my digital camera with this program without downloading to my hard drive. Can't import from either. Very difficult to understand and the language in the book is harder. I am not us to plug ins and I did not find the a lot of help from Adobe when I called in. They and I were both frustrated. Maybe it will work for you but it is a lot of money to find out. It is also non refundable!!"
2,It should come with a crutch it's so lame,"It's not that this program isn't useful, it's that there are freeware photo editing programs that do everything this does and more in a more streamlined way. Before you buy this do a search for Photofiltre or any of the other freeware programs.Why waste your money like I did?"
1,Won't work on my new Dell PC with Windows XP,"I downloaded the trial version and I had no problem installing it but I could not open it. It checked for plug-ins then went into initalizing and then I got the message ""Could not initialize Photoshop Emements because of a program error"". I went to the Adobe Web Support site but I could find no help with the error. A seach of the newsgroups showed that several others reported a similar problem but there were no resolutions. I removed the program and went out and purchased Microsoft Digital Image Pro 9. DIP loaded and opened with no problems and it works like a charm. Glad I tried the product on trial since I doubt Adobe customer support would have been much better had I laid out the cash for it."
5,Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0,This new version of Elements is more intuitive than the previous version and simply a joy to use. I have not yet mastered layers and other techiniques but am using this program far more often than version 1.0. The Quick Fix options are great and the text that accompanies with each option is simple to understand. The Undo feature is a really good way to experiment with the different controls and if you don't like what you have done-just undo it. Although probably not the use that Adobe intended it is a wonderful learning tool. I have used many Image Editing software packages and recommend this one to all of my friends. The only bad thing about the program is that once you use it for awhile you will be tempted to try Photoshop 7.
5,"Great Book, Great Cause","The ""author"", if you want to call him that I guess he would be more of a compiler, of this book created this book in order to help out his son. His I believe 19 year old son was injured in a swimming accident in Australia and is paralyzed David Nicholls created a non profit research organization to help find a cure so his son can walk again. I personally will be buying approximately 4-5 copies and mailing them to friends just to help the cause. Great recipies from some of the greatest chefs all over the world and a good reason, as if the recipies weren't enough, to buy the book."
4,"Great and Easy Recipes, Great Read","I recently got this cookbook and have been inspired to try out a few recipes. I have always wanted to try recipes from these famous chefs without having to spend three days on a dish a la Bouchon or the French Laundry Cookbooks. This is just the ticket, with the menus combining interesting ingredients and offer a glimpse (and taste) of the food these chefs eat when they are off duty. :D"
1,"Too much personal opinion, not enough facts","There are interesting theories in this book, however I would have much rather have seen more of the ancient text that supposedly refer to fish fossils, rather than her simple opinion that they do. Since paleontology is based on the remnants of information, it would be best to display them to their fullest,as the are all that you have.only when this is done, is there room for conjecture as to what they mean. but only giving little bits of evidence, and a lot of opinion leaves much to be desired, and is not good science. But then again I am a Physicist, so maybe I expect too much from Paleontology..."
4,My son loves this video!,"My 7 yr old received this for Christmas and absolutely loves it! He watches it every day, and is always asking questions about the content. It is geared to primary school aged kids, and is completely non-denominational. Frank Peretti is very gifted as a children's writer and performer. We'll be buying more of this series!"
2,Not Worth It,"As a big fan of Jen I thought this was a must purchase item...She looked OK, but not great and really didn't show anything at all downstairs."
3,Holder Didn't Support Table Number,"The holder is pretty enough but the spiral holder wasn't strong enough to hold the table number upright. In order for it to work, you will need a small sized card."
2,Very light and easy to knock over but attractive,"We bought these to hold our table signs for our wedding reception. The weight at the bottom is minimal, and the holders were not very stable, even without a sign in them. We had votives and candles in vases as part of our centerpieces, and one of our table signs actually fell into a candle and got singed before someone smartly pulled it out. They are super cheap, so good on a budget, but not great. It might be worth paying the couple extra dollars and just buying a pack from a craft store."
1,Is Just an INDEX,The book is just an index. All those who offer it for sale charge a lot for it and most don't advertise that it is just an index. Everything can be found on line which is page numbers for anything you are looking up.
5,Light Black for Epson 3800,"Since Amazon's description is too abbreviated, this is the Light Black cartridge for the Epson 3800."
4,Great History..,More of a history of The Christian faith. Could have been a perfect guide. A little overly detailed in parts. Not for the very new Christian.
2,Sorry Neil!,"Sadly, Powderfinger is by far a butcher. Otherwise, the originals are OK. Contains the classic Rusted Root but... Doesn't contain a full show. Mix is a little blurry.Have heard other soundboards that sound awesome compared to these shows."
5,Rusted Root LIVE,"Rusted Root's Live album is one that every member of the Tribe needs to have! Now you can relive the experience of seeing them in person in your house, at work, in your car, or just about anywhere else you listen to music! Its also a great cd for those who haven't been able to see them perform in concert to buy. Once you listen to this cd you will realize what you have been missing and get yourself in line for their next concert! As someone who has seen them in concert numerous times trust me when I say that this cd brought all those amazing memories rushing back! Thank you Rusted Root!"
5,Awesome CD!!,"This CD set is incredible.. It's defiantely one that I can listen to all the songs straight through and like them all. My favorite song off of CD 1 is ""Welcome to My Party"" My favorite on CD 2 is ""Send Me On My Way"". I think it's great to be able to hear them live, as some may not be able to get to a live show. All in all a definate must buy!!"
5,Awesome! The best....,"I bought this CD at a Live Rusted Root show I went to in Vermont. The entire CD is amazing and wonderful. Listen to it immediately, you'll love it."
3,Very Basic LOA Information,"I really like John Assaraf's pesonality. I hadn't known him before seeing The Secret. I thought he'd be a very good presenter with a lot of charisma. It's strange, but he's not that way in this video. Add to the fact that the information he provides is very, very basic Law of Attrraction information. Watch The Secret instead. It's outstanding and goes into FAR more detail. It's also beautifully produced."
1,"UNEXCITING, UNIMAGINATIVE, UNINSPIRING, and UNFUNNY","What is meant to be satirical is drivel. This book is literary trash. To Hell with this book, nothing works. If you want more humor or wit, go to a public execution."
2,Drum DVD purchase,Not quite what i was looking for. My beginning drummer is 4 yrs old. This is too hard for him to follow. Any suggestions?
3,Stylish with some negatives,"This TV is excellent on style, small footprint, and small comparative weight. This TV is best if your primarily watch DVD's or HDTV, and it is primarily a bedroom or second room TV, not a primary TV. The picture quality and size are not the best for regular cable TV, and the price definitely is not. It is awkward to connect all the necessary wires as they are all on one side or below the TV, and then you are supposed to thread them all through a removable panel with a 2 inch hole. Also, this version does not include a built in HDTV tuner. The computer monitor feature is good for hooking up to a laptop, but it uses up the only HDMI cable port."
2,Great picture and sound when it works...,"Bought this TV in December 2004 (have had a 13"" Aquos for a year and love it). About mid-January I started noticing 'flickering' of the picture. Sometimes it does it (and can get really dark too) and sometimes it doesn't. (I have replaced the cables with Monster brand and bought a new DVD recorder so I KNOW it has to be the TV). I'm reluctant to take it to a service center at this point since sometimes it works fine. Very frustrating! I called Sharp and they had no idea...told me just to take it to a service center. Too expensive a set for this kind of problem."
5,The world's best for teaching history,"I used this set of books, borrowed from my public library, to homeschool my children back in the eighties. We loved them! Alas, one day when I went to my library to check out another volume, the librarian told me they had been discarded. (Oh, unhappy day that I missed getting them!) I have been looking for them ever since. I couldn't find them because I mistakenly thought the title was ""A Picturesque History of the World."" Now I am so happy that I have finally found them. I recommend them to any homeschooler, or just anyone who wants to learn world history presented in an extremely fascinating way. They are supposed to be children's books, but I guess our current society is dumbed down enough, that most adults will find them very entertaining and interesting."
4,we are missing something...but it is great !!,"Great interpretation of the play, great music, sound effects, etc.We think we are really in Macbeth's casttle, and I think anyone so brave to turn off the light and hear the scene of the supper, or the images conjured by the witches.But, just one thing I disliked : Macbeth's voice. If you heard Orson Welles, you will dislike too. Althought, it is a good, well done, and joyfull interpretation. You will hear again and again as I do."
5,My son loves this!,"Surprisingly, my 3-year old LOVES this book. The first day I gave it to him, he wanted to read it 4 times in a row.Perhaps it's the fabulous illustrations or the simplicity of the story and his ability to relate to the boy in the book.Whatever it is, this is worth the purchase."
4,Great Book But A Little Advanced For My Little One,I got this book when my daughter was 18 months old and she didn't seem to understand a lot of it. 4 months have passed now and she enjoys it much more especially the drum page - she is always doing the drum chant! There are still some things that seem to confuse her like a page where the boy is dreaming of chicks but she does like the book and she gets the overall idea of it. It really is a good book but I would recommend it for a slightly older child.
2,disappointed,I was not happy with this book. It just didn't explain very well how to prepare an older sibling for the birth of a little brother or sister. It was a disappointment.
2,Amazing and sweet story.,"This is a wonderful story, especially for the 3-5 year olds. Max's sweet and emotional style helped my son cope with his own feelings while waiting for his baby sister to come. This is a MUST HAVE book for expecting moms with a preschooler in tow. Then, after this one...you must get Harriet Ziefert's Talk Baby!"
4,Fulfilling,"Although still falling short of the concept of a Toy Battle System, where any toy could be integrated into a Warhammer like game system, the second volume in the Giant Monster Rampage system, completes the GMR system. This volume includes everything I found lacking in the original.Includes new monster powers, new types of monsters, rules for playing the military side, and rules for creating your own powers.A very fulfilling volume, that could have been combined with the first to produce a five rating."
1,buy the 32/36,"Stay away from this product. It is not a real Weber, the parts inside say Solex on them. I put this on my 1985 CJ7 & have had nothing but issues with it. The jets it came with are for sea level, so I had to buy new jets & still can't get the thing to run right. Buy the 32/36 or the Motorcraft 2100."
4,Clever poems and great imagery,"This book was wonderful, my kids loved it. The poems are wonderfully clever and smart, and the pictures are great. Even my 4 year old loved it. I highly recommend it for all ages!"
3,Expected better.,"Not what we expected, a few were good. Most could not hold my toddlers attention, & he loves me to read to him. We have other titles by Jack Prelutsky that he adores, this one will stay on the shelf or be given away."
3,not as good as the others,"I have really enjoyed Md Riccio's series of the Divine Ladies, a group of 5 close friends who enjoy each other, a good mystery, and thier belief in the Wicca faith.This particular book does not seem to be as up to par as the previous due to a couple of impressions I have. First of all, the ladies are supposed to be in thier late 50's/early 60's, yet thier speech is of people much older. The book could use a good 50 pages of editing to tighten up the story, and get rid of extraneous dialogue and a slow start. Also, I didn't enjoy the characters as much as the previous books, due to thier lack of 'fleshing out' and development.OK, enough of that and onto the story itself. Very intriguing and different, with a great new man of mystery. THe protagonist and thier family definetly will be back with more tricks and hidden dangers. The story kicks into high gear after 100 pages, a bit long for this, but hang in and enjoy."
4,Great Gift!,I sent this to friends in California and they loved it for their housewarming. Who doesn't like pasta? Add some extra sauce - yummy.
3,"Pretty Font, but Difficult to Use","I bought this cartridge despite reading reviews that it had problems with letters tearing. Even with the design studio welding the letters and using the special cricut tools, I still ended up scrapping my first 2 cuts that were 1"" and 2"". I did have success using the shadow feature to make the letters bold and cutting them at 3"". I plan on continuing to use this font, but it will have to be shadowed, welded and at least 2"". This is still my favorite font though because it's pretty."
4,Not Just SO-SO,I am going to disagree with Jasmine not being good for small letters. I love to use it for small letters. It cuts the perfect size for fitting on to tags used in layouts. I originally bought it to use on Christmas layouts because of the elegant look it had. I use it a lot in other layouts because the small letters are versatile.
2,The letters are difficult to get out,"This cartridge looked so cute, but I have to say I don't use it much because the letters are really hard to get out of the paper. If you set the cut too low, it doesn't cut through the paper. On the other hand it rips the paper. If you do get the right level of pressure, the letters are still really fragile when you try to get them out. From my experience, don't even bother to use this cartridge unless you are going to cut letters at least 2"" big."
4,A Good stocking stuffer,"I got this book as a gift last year. It makes a great stocking stuffer, especially to those familiar with the series. The Bathroom Readers are well known for lots of useless yet fascinating trivia, grouped into short segments (for obvious reasons). This book on Christmas is shorter than most and, at 192 pages, goes pretty fast. It does, however, provide tons of background information on the holiday and everything associated with it. Anybody who likes useless trivia will love this book, and you certainly will not hate it. Four out of five stars."
4,Interesting reading,"I enjoyed reading this book-I did learn a few amazing facts that I did not know, although a couple of the pieces were a bit ambiguously written.A fun read, would recommend it for your guest bathroom during the holidays."
4,A glimpse into how the social elite inherit privilege.,"This book provides an interesting glimpse into the lives of students, teachers, and administrators of elite boarding schools. It describes the costs and benefits to students (and teachers) of an elite boarding school education, and how this ""rite of passage"" encourages the idea among students that their advantages are earned. It also describes how elite students are socialized for power; and how their social contacts and schools help them gain acceptance to the best colleges and, later, into the best jobs, with the full complicity of the college admissions officers. This is an easy-to-read, well-researched, and interesting book. My only complaint is that it is too short!"
4,A well thought-out study of the prep school experience.,I enjoyed the anthropological-based approach of this book. The methods and collection of material seemed appropriate and balanced. It also kept my attention with great quotes and inside opinions. A must read for anyone interested in the prep-school experience - just remember that the material is a bit out of date.
3,Interesting but dated,"I enjoyed this book but I felt like I was reading a history book. I wish the authors would update it to reflect the current situation. One list of the ""most prestigious schools"" dated to 1956, 50 years ago!"
5,Best Hardcore Metal EP since Slayer!,"Blackfish records have signed the best Brittish band in the world! The hardcore stlye of this Cd will make you feel like you've been dragged through a bush backwards and then had your head stamped on. Clear the room of breakables when your play this record and be prepared to be knocked through severn shades of anger. This is noisy almost jazzy, melodic and not to mention hardest of hardcore metal will blow you away. T R Maddock has the voice of an angel in a food blender screamer for help in cherabele kind of way. The heavy rifffs of R Coleman on his guitar will make you feel distorted and battered! All else is error is a masterpiece of sheer genius with tracks like purify, and in time to deal with how can you cope with the rest. Look out for these guys in the future, there gunna be big, very big! Joe Hales"
3,Buyer Beware,"This actually is a review on the seller rather then the item. I ordered this item through Amazon.com and it was shipped by J&R Music and Computer World. When I received the item, it was stamped refurbished on all sides of the box, so I never openned it. There most likely is nothing wrong with buying a refurbished item, but the point is that the description on Amazon.com did not say that it was a refurbished item. I'm sure it's not Amazon.com's fault, but be careful of who you're actually buying from..."
1,Home Entertainment System?,"DO NOT BUY if you dont have an amp AND a reciever. first of all, the speakers are puny. Next you need an amp to get 100WATTS as advertised. Wait theres much more, You need a reciever too. And last but not least, this item is refurbished! - which was NOT advertised as you can see."
1,Guess I got the lemon,"I got this meter based on the happy reviews from everyone else, but it has given me no end of problems. I simply can't get an accurate reading off it, I can't get it to zero properly. Maybe I just wound up with one bad meter, but color me unimpressed."
4,Es una buena opción,"La pinza no es gran cosa, sin embargo de acuerdo al precio está muy bien.Tiene todo lo necesario para efectuar un trabajo profesional donde la precisión no sea muy relevante.Es muy práctica y cómoda para manejar, tienes que estar pendiente de fijar el cero cuando mides corrientes por debajo de 400A, el material de la carcaza es de una especie de goma muy agradable al tacto.Totalmente recomendable para trabajos en el hogar y la industria."
4,Fantastic musical voyage,"If you are really into the atonal soundworlds of Leonard Rosenman and you don't care too much about variety, than this album will feel like plunging into a warm bath. Eerie yet beautiful, it unfolds itself slowly; like a good wine it gets better every time you listen to it."
5,A book that reveals the truth about reptiles!,"The plethora of myths, beliefs and lore regarding snakes is abundant and appears in all cultures. Many impressions and oft repeated misinformation about serpents embraces all recorded history. Much of the folklore about snakes in the U.S. is derived from Old World superstitions. Passed along in oral tradition from all regions of the world, the reptile is probably the most hated, feared and misunderstood animal of all creatures. More myths and misconceptions about snakes surpass the beliefs of any other common animal. This modest, readable booklet discusses all serpents, especially those of the South. Designed for easy reading, the text provides a wealth of fact, history and folklore of this maligned creature. It is an entertaining discussion that reveals truths about reptiles that are often more fetching than the legends and fears themselves. Quoted from ""Come-All-Ye"", Vol. 17, No.3 Fall 1996"
2,Only 34 pages long!,"This is a nifty booklet but hardly a book. It's only 34 pageslong and I was disappointed. I expected more for $. It contains muchof the same information in Desmond Morris's book ""Men and Snakes."""
3,Not as good as other San Sucre Items I've Purchased,"I bought this for Thanksgiving for those of us who were dieting and for my daughter who as a gluten intolerance. I also had other San Sucre mousses.While this mix was good, it is very strong (spices). We ate it, but I would not buy it again.BUT - I definitely recommend the San Sucre Mousses Mixes!"
1,Enhancing? I think not.,"Shortly after reading this book, I found myself longing for a warm bath and some razor blades."
3,Worth $15,"This is what I call a ""trinket toy"" - it's fun, it's cute but won't blow your mind. Mine has lasted just fine, still intact, no problems there. The shape is very fat, and with the soft barbs, makes it only useful for external stimulation. But it's got good vibrations, and with applied pressure, makes for a good clitoral teaser.Not a favorite, not great. But still a decent toy."
1,Poor quality,"This vibrator never lost it's pungent chemical odor. After a dozen uses, it loses power intermittently, depending somewhat on the wire angle. It appears to have a bad connection. It is now unusable. It was easy to clean and powerful enough for me. I have never owned any other vibrators, however. I found the head to be too big and the nubs uncomfortable for penetration. I don't recommend it."
2,"Nice toy, but the fun doesn't last long.","This vibrator is a fantastic shape, pretty color (I had the aqua) the vibes where acceptably strong and quiet, and the controller was easy to manipulate. All this praise doesn't count for much when it dies after the second use. The wires where evidently not soldered on securely, as it was shorting out. Now it is dead. How very disappointing. If it wasn't such a personal item, I would have returned it for a refund."
4,The Dogs Love Them,"My dogs seem to love their new beds. The light color shows some dirt, but they are machine washable. The only downfall is that they slip and slide on the wood floor. However, some carpet gripping underlays seemed to solve that problem."
2,NOT as pictured,"Being a photographer, I guess I could have made this product look as though it has deep sides also. It does not.It looks like some I have seen in stores, but it is not. No wonder those are $37!! This thing is thin--probably 1/2-inch foam at best. When it wears I will not buy the same thing again. As a liner in the crate for a recently neutered dog, it'll be okay.Other than that, te dog may as well just sleep on the carpet.Disappointed--I feel like I bought something off of ""FeeBay."""
3,Good for a crate,This item is good if you are going to use it in a crate or somewhere where it can't slide. The bottom is made of a nylon and is slippery on carpet and kind of noisy.
2,Okay,It is a nice little bed but it is to hard to clean and get dirty fast. My dog does like the plush sides of it though.
2,Not as pictured!,"The color and size are accurate however it is not a soft, plush fleece. It is not soft really at all but more like a shag rug in texture and my daughter describes it as spikey. I even ordered a second one thinking this was an anomaly but it was identical. I had to get an old one out of the attic that was still soft and smooth albeit used."
2,Not Great,"This product is not very good quality. It is light weight which is fine but very flimsy. It is constantly shedding balls of fibers all over the perimeter of the dog crate. I would rather have spent another $10.00, saved shipping and purchased a bed from Petsmart or Petco."
1,Very quickly disintegrates,"Ive had this product for about 4 days now and already it has lost 70% of it's fluffy ""coating."" My dog has not chewed or pulled this cushion apart. It just seems to have a very short life-span. I would recommend looking for a better quality product."
2,"Lasted for a while, but beware of fleece.","This pet bed wasn't too bad at first, but after about 3 months the fleece started to pill quite a bit. The dog then started chewing through it. The flat portion of the bed has 4x4"" squares sewn to keep the layers together. This has made it easy for our dog to make her way through the bed, square by square. The next bed with definately not be made of fleece, as it falls apart and gets matted and dingy."
2,Quite Disappointing,"Purchased this as a crate bed for my older dog based on the predominantly positive Amazon reviews, size fitting my crate and the price. Delivery was prompt, but once unpacked and used, the product is very disappointing. The only substantive padding on this thing is on the borders; the body of the bedding (where the animal mainly lays on) has almost no padding to speak of! I should have heeded the warnings from some other reviewers. Also, the material of the bed sheds very easily, creating a potential of the animal ingesting the small furballs and the negatives that come with that. The only positive about this item is its flexibility, folding easily to fit in the washer/dryer. My dog did not like it one bit, just kept pawing at it. Not worth the money I paid!"
3,comfy but sheddy,My dog likes it- she's a greyhound and loves the extra bolster around the edges that make it comfortable for her bony body. But the plush fabric sheds like crazy. I had this on a rug in my living room and had to vaccuum up the fuzz every single day.
4,my cat loves this bed,"It's soft and color fits in perfect with my cats favorite chair. Instead of putting towels down so people can sit in the chair without getting hair all over them, now I just put the bed on the floor and the chair is clean. I haven't washed it yet, so we'll see how well it stands up to that, but I'm hopeful."
4,Fleece Pet Bed,"This is an excellent bed that is easy to clean, especially with our new puppy. It is an excellent buy and is enjoyed by my new Scottie. It is her favorite place to sleep and play with her toys. Amazon had the best price for this item compared to a number of brick and mortar stores that had the same or very similar bed."
5,Prefect fit for my crate!,"The bed fit perfectly in my dogs XXL crate...she took to it immediately and I even found the cat asleep in it a couple of times...very easy to wash, nice material and great color. No complaints here!"
2,smaller than description states,"Since I purchased a Midwest wire crate, I thought this Midwest crate pad would fit perfectly (both state size 30"" x 21""). I was disappointed to see a big gap between the pad and the ends of the crate. This medium pad states it is 30"" x 21"", but it is only 27"" long. Also, the main area of the pad inside the ""bumper"" is very thin. I returned it and bought a crate pad from a local store that is thick and completely fills the bottom of the crate."
4,My puppy loves it!,This is a nice product. A little bit pricey but worth it. Its very soft and my puppy loves it!
3,Quiet Time Pet Bed,"Dogs love it, Not too bulky. Don't like color but had no choice. Light Tan color shows the dirt to easy. Would love it if it was dark color such as green, brown, or black."
3,Dog bed,"Fits cage nicely and the rim around the edges is the same height as the lower lip of the cage. We have used it for a month now for our 50 lbs Pit--mix for night sleeping only. The only complaint is that the fleece is coming out in small patches when she gets out in the morning. Its almost as like the fleece is rolling into balls and separating as she moves about. Maybe a washing will help remove the excess. Not much padding on the bottom, which would help with insulation. All in all, its fine."
2,Bed is not thick enough,I just bought this for my 70lb Lab and I think it is too thin and should be thicker.
5,Quiet Time Pet Bed,My cats love these beds. They are quite durable. I've put them in the washer and dryer several times and they're still intact and fluffy.
4,nice,I purchased 2 for my 2 german shorthair pointers and I love the way they come out of the washer and dryer. The only thing that could improve this would be a littler more padding in the middle. And the edges are like having a pillow and keeps them confined to a sleep area.
4,A great product for the price,"We use this pet bed as a liner for the dog's crate. It is definitely soft and fuzzy. As other reviewers have commented, it's easy to vacuum and toss in the washing machine. The bottom of the bed does have some padding, but not quite as much as we would have liked. We ended up buying a foam cushion to put underneath this bed to give the dog a little more comfort in her crate. If you used this bed on a carpeted surface, it might be fine on its own. We just saw the very same bed for sale at our local big-name pet store chain for $45. It's a steal here for less than half that price."
1,won't buy again,"these beds shed really bad. i have to vacuum it daily. Anytime my dog lays on it, he comes away covered in splotches of white fuzz balls from this pet bed."
3,Eh,"It's a bed yes but it's really thin on the bottom, I only use this when my dog is traveling with me because it doesn't take up much space in my car. I also use it for her crate but I would rather have a bed that's thicker. But if you aren't going to use it on a regular basis I'm sure your pet wont mind."
3,doggy bed,A nice decent bed for my dog. I'm not a fan of the price though I can get a bes like this for 20 bucks at petco. But as long as my furbaby is happy then I'm happy too
5,Dog friendly,"I bought this pet bed as a cozy lining for the cage in which I transport my dog in the car. The cage's base measures 30"" x 19"", and this product fits perfectly, and doesn't slide around with movement of car or dog.Manufacturer claims the bed to be machine washable, will update review after I have seen how it survives this process."
4,too large on the size I got.,"my two dogs, both loved it but the bed itself was too large for the area I had thought out in putting their bed so I had to return it, which was a hassle with UPS and amazon. but after many attempts it was solved and money was refunded 100%."
4,Cat Loves This,I bought this for a cat to sleep on in a crate. I put this up on a shelf that I had installed across the upper half of a wire pet crate. The cat's litter box was below the shelf. Works great.
4,Nice but Not Thick,"The bolsters are nice, it is washable which is mandatory (I think), but the floor is not very thick and not waterproof. It were waterproof, I would have given it 5 stars."
4,"Great price, soft, nice bolsters","It does make a slight crinkling sound. The bottom is kind of flat, like others said, this would be nice for a crate liner. Also works well for traveling or in the car. Overall really good price. I might get the smaller version for my cats, who seemed to like it a lot."
2,"Falls apart, extremely thin","I bought this because of the good reviews, but it wasn't what I was looking for. This Pet Bed may be a good addition to a kennel as it does not take up a lot of room, but I tried to use as is just on the floor. Very thin material that started to fall apart when small dog rubbed against it. The padding is nonexistent. My dog preferred to lay on the carpet. Cheap price, but not a good value."
4,Just enough,This little bed if perfect for my dog's crate. It's not very thick but that makes it easier to handle. I have not tried to wash it yet but I imagine that it would easily go into the machine. The main thing is my dog seems quite happy with it and sleeps well!
3,Expected it to be a little bit thicker,"My dog loves dog beds - we have about 3 now, but I decided to order this one so she has one that is more 'portable' when we visit friends/family over the Holidays... It arrived yesterday, and is a nice color and material and the perfect size (36x23) for her (55lb) and she assumed the ahhhh position immediately, with head on bolster...The only issue I have is that it isn't really all that thick at all. I have it on a carpeted surface in the bedroom right now, and it barely adds any cushion at all... so I can't imagine what it will be like when we use it on hardwood flooring or tile... The bed area simply needs to be twice as thick as it is - or maybe twice as firm or something....So, its ok, but I am a little disappointed."
3,Quiet Time Bolster Pet Fleece Bed Wearability,"Yes, this is washable, but it does shed and becomes thinner in spots. Eventually, it wears very thin in places, produces a lot of lint and needs to be replaced. Mine lasted about a year with the dog sleeping in the crate every night. Not a bad value, but I'm going to spend a little more next time."
3,Fuzz!,"The pet bed is durable and easy to wash. However, I cannot keep my carpet free of the dark gray fuzz that the bed easily sheds. My dog tracks it everywhere."
5,love this bed!,"this is the second quiet time bed i've purchased. good quality and my dog says it's comfy :Pwashable, durable."
3,Fast delivery,Product is awrsome! My dog actually sleeps now! All we had was a towel but now that he is older it was getting uncomfortable for him so we got him this bed an he is much more comfortable! :)
3,Dog likes it,"My dog seems to enjoy this pad, but I had to put a blanket over it to increase the cushioning. The fabric is soft, but it doesn't have much cushion at all. I also think it is too expensive."
4,Nice but the seam tore after about a week,"The Quiet Time Boster Fleece pet bed 42X26-inch fit the crate pretty nice. My English Bulldog really likes it. I washed it on gentle after having it about a week, but it torn down the seam, so I had to sew it up. Still usable, but notice it was torn down the seam again, after being washed, so sewed it up again. I like it even through it has torn a few times. My dog seems to really like it. She is only in the crate at night. She seems to be comfortable and sleeps well with it."
4,"Nice, but very narrow!","I bought the small one (22x13). It was actually just over 10 inches wide (the length was fine). Therefore it does not fit well in the crate. I don't know if they are all that way or if this one was a mistake. However, it is sturdy and well made, so I am keeping it for my smallest crate. Just be aware that it is not very wide. The proportions look entirely different from the photo."
2,Fleece tufts detach from bed,"The bed does not seem to be as comfortable as the cinnamon or grey beds that are included in the Midwest Pets selection. I also have a cinnamon one, which I would give 5 stars to. In fact, I just bought another to replace this bed. The worst problem with this bed is I started seeing what looked like little cotton tufts around the bed and then in other parts of the house. They come off when my puppy starts ""digging"" to try to make himself comfortable and more scary, he possibly tries to chew them. It doesn't seem like he has swallowed any; he would have choked. But, obviously, I can't keep it in the crate that I bought it for. It's pretty and I wanted white for the room it is in. But safety trumps anything else."
4,The cats love them!,I ordered these for crates that I will use when I drive my cats across country- wanted them to have a few months to get used to them. The are well made and the bolster is a great place to rest your chin if you are a cat. I gave it a 4 as the base could be a little softer to me but the cats probably would have given them a 5. I have not yet washed them but they look like they will wash well. And they fit like a dream in the crate. They are stitched firmly and seem like they will be durable.
5,Awesome,"This is a great buy. My puppy is going through training and I have to admit that this is in the wash almost every night. However, it has held up beautifully!"
3,Good for the price but will leave fleece all over the place,"For the price, you can't really beat this pet bed. My dog likes it, but he doesn't love it. But I have the vacuum all the time, this bed seems to shed more than he does, and I've had it for several months. If you're trying to get the cheapest good bed, this is probably it. But a little more money might go a long way."
4,Comfy!,"Both my dog and my two year old love this bed. It is comfy and my dog likes to rest his head on the bolster. He is a sixteen year old chow/lab mix and the size is great for him. The bottom did seem a bit thin so I put it on top of his old dog bed for extra cushion. I can't wait to wash it to see how it comes out. Right now, it is making little fuzz balls all over and I think a good wash may remedy the problem. Overall, the bed was a success with my dog and that is what matters more than a couple of fuzz balls."
4,quick delivery - nice bed,"got it quick. was packed very well. it comes folded but when you lay it down - it stays flat.the bed is very soft and springy. the fleece part is not as cottony as clothing type - it feels a little more synthetic - but still really soft.i laid it down in his crate and my dog went right in and went to sleep. he NEVER goes in his crate willingly. so we were really surprised.as to durability - dog chewed thru it the first night = but my dog chews EVERYTHING he eats thru big thick bone. so if you have a massive chewer like me - then he will chew it up easily but if you have a more ""normal"" dog then this is great for you.i think also that its a tad smaller than what the dimension is - so there is a little space left. but just a littlewill buy from this seller again"
2,Falls apart,"I bought this bed after reading the reviews and thinking this was really going to work out, but the fluff on it just kept coming off. It was always all over my living room floor. My one dog has a nervous condition where she licks everything and I'd always find her with some of the fluff in her mouth. I ended up throwing the bed out. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars was because my dogs actually did like the bed."
3,its ok,"it fits perfect in the crate that i bought, but the fleece leaves little pieces of fuzz that i have to pick up. it also looks dirty after about a week. i washed it and bleached it, but it still looks dirty. it would be nice if there was a fitted cover for it."
2,Huge! Great for two large dogs!,"This bed was perfect for our purpose. We needed something this exact size where both of our large dogs could sleep. However, I wash it once a week and it has already started to show wear. Also, there are little fuzzies everywhere! It's perfect for now but I would not buy it again."
3,"A little pilly, but works well.","This fleece pet bed fits perfectly in our crate. We have found, however, that it gets a little pilly & ""sheds"" likely due to my dog trying to bury his bone under it. He digs & the fleece comes apart.I'll wait to see how it fairs after a good wash."
2,my puppy just like pee on it,"my puppy pee on it. and i wash it. after you wash, you will know how poor the quality is."
1,Destroyed in less than 24 hours,"I bought this for the cage of my 7 months old Boxer, and he tore it apart in less than a day. My dog doesn't chew on shoes, couch, or any types of furniture. This was the first piece of ""furniture"" he destroyed. If your dog is a chewer, then save yourself $20 and get something better. It was also a lot thinner than I expected it to be. For now, I'm just going to use a folded blanket for my dog to sleep on."
2,lasted a month,Unfortunately our 4 month old puppy chewed up the fluff inside after having it for a month. =(
2,Not for a cat!,"I guess that my cat would rather sleep with me, she doesn't seem at all interested in the pet bed."
5,Pet Bed,"I found this pet bed and I am so glad I did. My dog is 12 yrs old and has arthritis, so I wanted something comfortable for him to lie in. Well he loves this bed, he lies in it all the time and he loves to rest his chin on the raised sides. I love my dog, he isn't just a pet he's a member of my family and I am so glad I found this pet bed to make his life a little easier."
3,"cozy, but sheds","The bed fits the kennel well, but it seems to shed easily and I find bits of fleece all over."
3,quiet time pet bed for cats and dogs,"We thought our cats would like it more than they did. It is a perfectly fine mat but we have found that our cats adore the heated bed with higher sides. It makes them feel more secure, we think. They just got spayed and took to their heated bed immediately. This may be just our two however and I would recommend the the quiet time bed anyway."
2,Dust collector,"This bed is terrible. The fleece is a dog hair magnet! It also likes collecting bone and treat fragments. Sure you can wash it, but hair, dirt and treats cling to the fleece and I find that I am washing it more often than not. I definitely would not buy this again, nor would I recommend to anyone who has a dog with fur who likes to chew on bones."
1,Lasted for a week,"Looked nice when I opened it. I got it as a liner for my crate. My dog destroyed it within a week. I didn't expect indestructible, but I did want something a bit sturdier."
2,okay,"this worked for a while in the crate, thin has no support . would not recommend for your pet. washes up ok"
3,Wouldn't buy another one.,"It's not as padded as I thought it would be.I bought a smaller one at Walmart that had much more padding, and this is supposed to be for a larger dog and the padding was scant."
5,Plush little doggie bed,"Well made crate cushion for our Mini Doxie, fits perfectly in her crate and is nice and plush."
4,Useful cat bed,The bed probably is best for in-carrier use but since the carrier I have comes with one. I leave this fleece bed out on the floor in my room. My Linguini (a med-sized 8 lb kitty) fits in pretty well. She occasionally naps there until she discovered how much better my bed feels. Most of the time she just uses it as a relatively comfy seating area when she grooms herself.
4,Nice bed!,"I love how soft this bed is, and how BIG it is!I was pleasantly surprised about the size. I thought it would be much smaller.More importantly my puppy LOVES this bed!The only thing I don't like is how easily fuzzes come off, but my dog does try to dig a hole in it sometimes."
5,My Dogs Love These,"This bolster style crate pad fits just right and my dogs love to snuggle in it. I was using rugs in their crates for awhile and they clearly did not like that. Now they go right in knowing these warm crate pads are waiting for them. Also, these were the best price I could find."
5,Great pet bed!,"this is a wonderful pet bed, both our dog and cat love them. They also wash very easily."
4,Fits Great and the Puppy Has not Problem with it,"It fits our crate perfectly, it is quality material, the puppy enjoys laying on it, so its a good product and reasonable price (although I think all pet supplies are over priced)."
2,Could Be Improved,"Purchased this bed as a bundle with Giant airline crate and water bowls. This bed is not ideal for crate use - it has a satin fabric bottom that slides everywhere. A fleece bottom would have made more sense. Also, this size is way too small for Giant kennel."
4,no frills pet bed,"giving this 4 stars because you just cant beat the price. the bed is washable and fits the midwest crates (which are awesome!).the bed itself is slightly plush around the edges, but there really isn't any padding at the bottom, its more like a fuzzy blanket with rolled up edges.anyway can't beat the price, but you get what you pay for!"
5,Comfy little bed,"This is comfortable and easy to clean little bed for my dogs.I originally bought it for my beagle x dachshund, but my Basset Hound has since appropriated it. It may look small, but they can both still snuggle up comfortably on it.It is easy to clean in the washing machine, and dries quickly. It's pilling a bit, but that's no big deal. It has some kind of waterproof or water-resistant fabric on the bottom which is really handy, too."
3,You get what you pay for,"its is basic and inexpensive. it is a good value for the price. I was hoping for more padding, but that will cost more."
3,Just OK,"I bought this bed for my 13 lb Pomski Cooper for his crate and as his nighttime bed. The edges are fluffy and the bed is built fairly well, but the bottom is flat and thin and not cuddly. It takes him a while to settle down on it, and he doesn't seem to have a preference between the bed or the carpet floor. The color is the same as the picture, and the outside fabric/fur is very soft. It does fit nicely in his crate and seems to repel stains every now and then when he has a little accident. It washed in the machine fine, but the fur melted together a little from the dryer even though I dried it as directed. I would not by this bed again for my dog, but a dog who isn't cuddly might like it."
2,"It's better than a hardwood floor, but not by much.","My dogs will lounge on hardwood floors just to be around people, so at least this can take the chill off during the winter months, but if you're looking for a plush bed or crate pad, this isn't it. Within days of using this inside my dogs' crates, the bottom layer of cushion had essentially disappeared. The only fluff left was in the side bolsters. One of my dogs still used the bolster as a pillow, but the other decided to chew on it and had all the stuffing out in minutes. These beds, even at the largest dimensions, can easily be tossed in the washer, but that's really the only good thing I can say about them."
4,It's Fine,"Sheds fuzz and is a little hard to machine wash in that dirt has a hard time coming loose out of it. Whatever, the dog LOVES it and, after all, it's all about the dog, right?"
1,Disintegrating,It seems to be molting. I keep finding tufts and having to clean them out of the pet carrier. I would not buy this product again.
3,Wont last long,I've had this pet bed for a few months now and it is wearing down very thin. I don't expect it to even last 6 months at this rate. It was relatively inexpensive and fit our dog's crate perfectly. But I would have liked something that was of better quality and durability to withstand daily use and the occasional washing.
2,The fleece sheds worse than the dog . . .,The fleece fiber comes off and gets all over the house. I've never had this problem with faux-fleece dog beds I've purchased in the past.
4,Nice dog bed for cheap.,"I really like this dog bed because it fits perfectly inside of my dogs crate (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002TKBUS/ref=cm_cr_ryp_sol_prd_title). For the price, this is exactly what I was looking for, a base for my dogs crate. The reason for the 4 out of 5 stars is because the padding on the bottom is pretty thin, so we had to place a folded dog blanket on the bottom for more cushion since the bottom of the dog crate is metal."
5,Wonderful Bed,"This bed is the perfect size. My dogs love to sleep together, and it is hard to find a nice bed big enough for the two of them. I have a 75 lb Labrador and a 20 lb corgi. They love it and it is soft and keeps them warm."
2,fleece bed leaves a mess,midwest fleece bed is pretty thin and the fleece is easily scratcht out and is a mess. I do not see this lasting very long
4,crate mat,"My dog loves it, we had a microfiber mat in his kennel before but it was lighter in weight and had less cushion, he prefers this one. My only concern is washing it because it is that fleece kind of material."
5,kitty bed,"This bed is awsome! Really good size, soft and washable. We have a Maine Coon cat, 14 months old and 23 lbs, it works for his size. Great pricing."
5,My bulldog loves it,"I got a size big enough for her crate, but she likes to have it in the living room. Love the bumper on it because it keeps her toys from rolling away."
5,a great place,"This was meant to be put in our puppies crate when he got to a point that he could hold his bladder all night. Right now it is his ""place"" in our family room, where he goes to lay down or chew on a toy. I will probably have to purchase another one for the crate. The cat also likes to lay on it when the puppy is outside."
2,ripped to shreds.,"The picture makes the bed look alot more sturdy than it really is. I have a chihuahua that is very active and loves to chew and romp around. I was disappointed at how flimsy this was when I opened the box. After having this for a week, my dog has almost shredded this thing. He has other beds that he likes to chew on that have outlasted this. Overall, poor quality. Very thin. I think he ripped it apart because it was not very comfortable."
4,Crate bed,"We bought one of these for our traveling soft crate. It's a very thin bed, but the fact that it's machine washable has made it a great addition whenever we need to go anywhere with our shiba. If he knocks over his water bowl, it keeps the mess contained."
2,thin,This product I thought would be a little thicker with the pad . But is ok .but my dog like more cushion so I put a pillow in it . The product also said it was washable but not direction to do so .
2,dog bedding,"Well I have to say i am not happy, you sent me the crate and bedding seperately and the bedding was HUGH and does not fit the crate. Sais when ordered 36 by 23 but it is much much bigger. very disappointed."
3,Nice Item With A Fault.,"Seems to be a nice item at a decent price. Dog loves it.The only downside to it is that the bottom is made of avery slick material and it has a tendency to slip and slideon the wood floors whenever the dog gets in or out of it.Poor planning when designing it. Im going to put one ofthe throw rug non slip pads under it. Decent item with adesign fault.UPDATE 3/21/2012- The dog may love it, but I dont.There is more fuzz & cotton on my hardwood floorsthan there is in the pet bed (not really-but a lot).Time to chuck it and look for something better.UPDATE 5/10- Just tossed it out and ordered another.Guess its only good for 2 months. Goodthing its cheap."
4,Great except for the fuzzies,"This is a really good dog crate bed. It's the second one I bought (I also have a smaller one to fit my smaller crate). I primarily wanted one that would fit the whole crate to protect the crate bottom and this fits the bill. My dog really loves laying against the raised siding. My only complaint is that it produces lots of fuzzies that I find in the bed and around the room, even after multiple washings. But they're easy enough to pick up. I would certainly buy this product again."
4,Nice product - fits well but sheds,The bed fits the Midwest kennel perfectly and is really nice and soft but it sheds a great deal.
4,Not Bad,"The only problem I have with this bedding, is that it gets dirty very quickly. I bought the fleece one for both of my dogs. After just a couple of days it gets very dirty. I'm not a huge fan of the fleece either. I ended up buying the gray, plush one instead though, and threw the fleece ones in the trash. It's a lot nicer! It's very soft. Also, because it is a gray color, it doesn't get noticeably dirty after two days. I still wash them once a week but the fleece one had to be washed every other day. I highly suggest buying the plush beds over the fleece..."
3,to thin,"looks great not as thick as i thought is supposed to be but my dog loves it and lays on it all the time, i put his old bed underneath to give it more cushion."
3,"Eh, it's ok.",I was disappointed that this bed was not as dense and sturdy as one I had purchased a few years ago at the pet store.
2,Not what I expected,"I got this fleece bed for my pit bull puppy when he was 10 weeks old. The padding is almost non-existent and it shedded like crazy. He is now 10 months old and the bed is still in his crate, only because it's softer than the hard plastic, but I wouldn't recommend it. For when he's outside of his crate, he has a chew-resistant bed with which I'm very satisfied."
2,Was okay while it lasted.,"Our dog decided that this bed was a good chew toy, and unfortunately the bed didn't have much to offer in the way of defense. Overall the bed is very thin and flimsy, not much padding at all. The sides were chewed out so easily, I woke up one morning (about 2 weeks after getting the bed) to find all of the stuffing ripped out and the fleece was all torn apart. Needless to say it went in the garbage and I won't be buying another one for our dog.This may not be a problem if your dog doesn't chew, but ours does, and it is a problem that he can destroy it so easily. Looks like we need to invest in something a bit higher in quality next time."
3,It's smaller than it appears but my dog seems to like it,"It's not as big as you might imagine and the sides of the bed are very low its more like a mat with slightly raised edges. However my dog likes it so I can't complaint too much, just wish it was a little more for the money."
5,Great pet bed!,"My greyhound LOVES this bed! Super soft and durable. I couldn't get my dog out of her crate when I put it in! Fits perfectly into my 48"" Midwest crate!"
3,It's alright..I guess,"It definitely is soft and seems more than comfortable, but for some reason my cat does NOT want to sleep on it. The only thing she does with it is bite it and claw at it, so I regret buying this. I give it 3 because it could just be my cat who has an innate disliking for fleece."
3,"Good crate bed, but not for chewers","Bed was good quality, fit our Great Dane's crate perfectly. Was a little thin, we used a blanket on top of the bed. However, after about a month our dog started to rip the fleece off the bed, one panel at a time. Would not recommend for dogs that tend to chew their bedding."
2,Not Durable,"My 5 month beagle mix has destroyed this already. Its made of a material thats easily destroyed, a sheep like material. She loves how comfy and soft it is but it leaves balls of material all over the floor."
3,Made where?,"It would be helpful to know if products are Made in the USA, since these are the only items I want to purchase.Petmate 25-Inch Burrow Bed, Navy BlueAmazon should take note and list where items are made. I do not like products made in China. Therefore I want to know which country manufactured them, on ANYTHING."
5,"well made, soft and cuddly for pets","I purchased these for my german shepherds. They love the all around bolster to lay their head on. These are machine washable and I usually replace them yearly. Reasonably priced and comfortable for my ""babies"""
3,Not all bad for the price..not as thick as it should be...,"Order cam quick, and the bed isn't all that bad for the price. Things I didn't care for, the bottom has very little padding and the covering gives off fuzzies every where. We have gray carpet and it is a constant battle to keep the fuzzies vacuumed up. I have to say thoug, my dobe loves it. He moves it where he wants it and is never far from it."
4,Is exactly as presented.,The bed fits our 36inch crate perfectly. Our golden loves it. The only down side is that we had to wash it due to a midnight poop and it took a few times to get it clean. At $18 we should have just bought a new one!
2,OK...not great,"Puppy seems to like this pad, but I'm not crazy about it. A little thinner than I expected and puppy has really enjoyed how easy it is to pull the fluffy outside layer off, but not sure if he wouldn't do that to any other pad."
1,Disgusted,"Love Amazon, but not this time, I purchased 4 what I thought were Midwest Quiet time mats.......I have been working with dogs forever and have used this product over the years, the 4 mats I received were not up to standards, very thin, not the same backing and continued to release bits of fuzzy materials, that caused one of my dogs to need vet care!!! A very cheap imitation of the real thing....I have 4 mats that I purchased 2 years ago with regular washing that are in better condition than the 4 I purchased from Amazon late February...buyer beware"
3,Not as comfy as it looks,"I got this bed to go in the new crate I purchased. It was suggested for the crate I chose so I figured why not. When it arrived it was more of a mat than a bed. My dog isn't picky and its better than him being on plastic but I would've preferred something with more cushion.On the us side, its a prefect fit so I plan to keep it until it gets worn out."
1,Not enough cushion,After reading all the positive reviews I chose this bed over others. I must tell you this the color is wonderful but the bed falls way short of what I expected. If your dog loves a soft bed DO NOT purchase this bed. I am having to use a blanket in order for her to be comfortable in the bed other wise she will not use it. So if it's comfort your little fur baby requires DO NOT purchase this. I found one the exact same size to fit my crate at Big Lots and it has about 6 inches of padding in the bottom for the same price that I purchased this on for.
1,Poor Quality,Within days of receiving this product it began to fall apart. I ordered two of them and it happened to both. The last dog bed of this type that we had lasted for 7 years. I doubt these will last 7 weeks. I have a ball of pile from each one the size of two baseballs. Our dog is not a digger. The pile has come off just with her sleeping on the pads. Very disappointed with the product. Would not purchase this again.
3,Wish it had more padding,"I purchased this mat at the same time I bought a crate for my puppy. The size was perfect for the crate, but I was disappointed that mat was so thin. It provided no cushion for the bottom of her crate, or warmth for that matter. After a few washings it started to show wear. It didn't last long, about 3 months, and I have since switched to an old blanket. My dog seems to like that a lot better."
3,Looks more comfy than it is,The nice high edges make this pad appear to be very plush and padded. It's not. The pad squishes right down to the ground offering almost no comfort for my large dog. This pad also sheds more than my dog does. IF he uses it there always seems to be shedded pieces of fake wool all over my carpet. He doesn't like it so he tries to fit his 120 pound butt into the bed we have for my 20 pound dog. Needles to say he smashed the little dogs pad but he won't use this one.
4,"Not ideal for ""diggers""","This bed is exactly what I wanted and exactly what was suggested for my new puppy, but he is considered a ""digger"" and he digs the fluff up from this all the time. Other than that it is perfectly made! No tags on the top or edge fpr chewing and fits perfectly in my crate."
4,Soft and comfortable,The Kitties and Puppy love it.... and it's easy to wash and dry...Plus the price was right.... Phoebe Lou
5,Great value!!!,This same product was much more expensive from another site. This bed is nice and soft and fits perfectly inside our dogs' crate.
4,Perfect fit for the Midwest crate,"No surprise that this bed fits the Midwest 30x21 crate perfectly. The bottom padding is a little thin -- I would like to see it be a little more padded, but so far no complaints from my miniature schnauzer. Also the bed has been ""shedding"" some of the fleece material as he tries to fluff it up. But for the price and given the fit, it's a good purchase to go with the crate. It also works well just to put it in the back seat of the car, so he can ride there."
2,smaller than stated size,The 13 in by 22 in pet bed is actually only 11 3/4 in. by 21 in. and is too small for the crate. I plan on sending it back.
2,dog,I wish I had not bought this particular bed. It sheds!!!!!!! It is already getting thin from shedding. And white was my mistake.
2,Leaves a mess all over the house,The little bits of fabric from the bed end up all over the house. Would not recommend this. Dog likes it which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1.
1,this should not show up with the carrier I purchased,"make sure you measure. i have no idea why Amazon shows this bed with the case I bought. I stupidly thought it would be a good fit. Measure. don't believe them when they say ""customers also bought this with this item""...ridiculous. To Amazon's credit with a little effort and one hang up from one rep, another made all well and paid for this oversized thing to be returned postage paid. okay, I should have measured, but why did they feature them together? THAT WAS MY COMPLAINT."
2,Not Cushy,"This is a nice addition to my puppy's crate - the softness, fit - but it doesn't have any cushiness in the bottom of the bed. The fabric is nice like the sides, but the cushiness of the sides needs to also be on the bottom. It is thin and rests on the hard plastic of the crate bottom. I put a folded blanket in with the bed to make it more comfy, but that makes the crate too small and uneven.. I also had some shrinkage when I washed and dried it. Some reviewers said they liked the padded edge, but my puppy can't rest his head there - he's then up against the wire of the crate sides. All that said, my puppy hasn't complained."
1,Really bad quality fleece,I'm adding one more vote to the bad fleece comments. After less than three weeks of use the half of the bed our puppy had access to is threadbare. I've never had a dog that did not scratch at their bed before laying down trying to get the thing just right. This left a fuzzy mess all over our floor and the inside of the cage.
1,"Good until wash, now a health hazard to puppy","I bought this for my 3 mo old puppy. He likes it just fine, but I started having problems with it after the first wash. The fleece started to shed all over the place. If I took the bed out and placed it on my red area rug, it would leave pills of white fleece. Recently, my puppy has been vomiting food stuffs mixed with the fleece fibers. Buy at your own risk. I would not recommend this item to anyone who cares about the health of their pet."
1,this thing doesnt stay together..,"I just recieved this yesterday and first off, the packaging of the product was very poorly done. Once i got it open and put it down for my dog, the fleece fuzz was just falling off it with every thouch. I actually had to take it away from my dog because he liked to lick it and chew it a little and the fuzz was just getting everywhere and i was afraid of him ingesting some and causing problems. I didnt expect this product to be this poor of a product but i am very dissapointed. Hopefully when he grows out of his chewing stage i can try this again.."
3,Very comfortable - but perhaps not suitable for scratchers,"This fleece pet bed is well-made and gives my pet padded comfort. It fits perfectly in my cage. My Chihuahua has lots of space on the small version (24x18x21).I place it inside theMidwest Life Stages Single-Door Folding Metal Dog Crate, 24""L x 18""W x 21""Hwith theMidwest Stainless Steel Snap'y Fit Water and Feed Bowl, 10 Ounce. My dog is so comfortable on it that he chooses to use it for daytime naps and for his overnight bed. It is also great when confining while training. It machine-washes and machine-dries well.My rating of 3 stars is based on my dog having clawed at the surface, causing some damage. - I wonder about its ability to stand up to this treatment. Other pet-owners (where this is not a problem) would undoubtedly rate this item 5 stars.A great price and quick delivery through Amazon with FREE Super Saver Shipping."
3,Cute doggie bed,It was ok for my dog although for her to stay in it all night I had to put a blanket beneath it
4,Serves the purpose,"Definitly not the most comfortable bed out there but will serve the purpose if you want something you can wash frequently, which I do, so tehy work well for me!"
2,It sheds,This thing sheds like you wouldn't believe. It shed so much that my dog had respiratory problems from it. He would always wheeze during the night and cough up nasty fleece filled mucous! I vacuumed pieces of the bed daily! I had to throw it away.
2,white bed for dog (same color as padding),"at first i was very excited to buy my dog a bed, please be aware that this bed is white and is the same color as your padding. My dog has mistaken this bed as his pissing area."
3,Good for about a year if you dry it.,"For the price, this is fine, but be sure to wash it on gentle cycle and NEVER dry it. Because it's made from a synthetic fiber, it will retain smells and matt if you dry it.On the plus side, it does grab on to pet hair and keep it one place."
3,Lots of pilling,"We wanted a pad for the crate so we didn't hear the dogs nails scratching on the bottom of the crate at night, and while this does the trick, the amount of pilling is ridiculous! It is all over the house, the dog, and the dog's paws! I'm also afraid that the dog will eat it the pilling since he is a chewer."
2,Get ready to find tufts of wool EVERYWHERE,"While my dog seems to find this bed comfortable, I'm already preparing to buy a new one, after one week of use. The bed sheds little balls of wool constantly, and they end up all over the house. I hate it. The dog bed sheds worse than the dog."
3,Only OK,"The bed fits perfectly in the crate, however after about a month of use, it's paper thin and falling apart. I currently have little balls of fluff all over my apartment that stick to my dog."
1,This bed sheds,"I bought this bed for our dog to use in our family room. Since he likes pillows, I thought the bumper would be good. BUT, this bed constantly sheds. I find little white pieces of fleece all over the house, the carpet and the dog. I have taken the bed outside and shaken it, trying to remove loose fleece. It still sheds, which makes it a real nuisance. I would not advise purchase of this bed to anyone."
5,Great bed,Bought this for a friend who is 93 and has an old dog who follows her all around the house. The bed is light enough for her to easily move it from room to room so he has a cosy spot wherever she is. They both love it.
3,Dog bed,"This bed is pretty thin on the bottom and twists in the crate when the dog lays down. I have washed it twice and that went well. It was cheap for a reason, like most things."
1,A thin dog bed that won't last,"The padding on this bed is really lacking, so my dog for the most part steered clear of it. So I planned on putting it in my dog's crate, but it didn't even last 3 days before my dog tore a hole in it.You'd be better off spending your money elsewhere unless you have a very lazy dog who isn't picky about where he or she sleeps."
3,Bed for dog crate,The bed fit our crate perfectly and our dog likes it but it is loosing big chunks of the faux fur! Still worth the money!
2,not what I thought,"When I opened the package I had to laugh, not what I was expecting for the price. product cheaply made, very thin, not worth the price at all."
3,gets pilly fast,I purchased this item late July 2010 & it was destroyed today. I have 2 boxer puppies that sleep in same crate-I noticed fairly soon after purchase fleece balls in the creases of the bed. Got progressively worse as time went by. Today for some unknown reason they decided to tear the bed apart-destroyed in a matter of minutes.
3,"Too Thin, Not Warm Enough for Floors. Maybe Carpet Ok...","This product was really thin and does not give enough cushion for the dogs. They still like it but it's because they are not picky ;) hehe but I was disapointed on how thin it was, as they are outside dogs and this was suppose to keep them warm in the garage. I bought 3 and had to put towels on top on them to make it have more cushion. :/ Maybe on carpet it can be okay though."
2,Good bed for a short while,"This bed was great for about 6-8 weeks. I washed it a few times, and now it is shedding white ""fur"" like crazy. It sticks to the dog and there are tufts of the fleece all over the kitchen as well as the living room carpet. I thought it might just happen for a short time, but it's constant. If it wasn't so big and tough to ship back, I'd return it."
5,Great Beds!,"Ordered two of these for my chihuahua and shih tzu puppies, as I am creating them a ""puppy room"" and wanted to set up a really cozy, comfy bedding area. This was a great deal - the beds are nice and soft, pretty durable, and I like the fact that they are washable as well. I can see us holding onto them for a very long time. The fleece is nice for the pups to curl up in and will help keep them warm on cool nights. Great purchase."
1,Waste of money,Thin and non-durable. My puppies were pulling fuzz out of it within minutes (which was not fun to clean up) and wouldn't sleep on it anyway because it's so thin. I definitely feel like I chucked $13 into the toilet on this one. Do not buy.
3,Small,I picked this out for my puppy and its very long and not wide enough. I also wasnt a fan of the sheepskin it feels kind of itchy and hot. Great product for a cool natured dog not an english bulldog and deff not a very big dog!
2,Decent,"Hard to remove dog hair from it, so it looks like hell. Had to throw it away after a few months. Went to a dog bed that looks like an old sleeping bag, definitely easier to clean. Would not recommend."
3,"Ok beds, hold up well in the wash","I just want to say now, I am absolutely sick of purchasing dog beds. If I had my way, they would sleep on towels. But the reason I have dogs is the same reason they are not allowed on towels...I am married and what she says goes.So beds it is. Lots and lots of beds.My puppies tend to be a bit destructive. They take particular joy in ripping the stuffing out of every bed I give them. Then the washing machine pretty much finishes those other beds off.With these beds, there is not much for them to rip out, so far they have lasted the longest out of any of the beds I have owned in the 7+ years of dog stewardship. The washing machine can cause some pilling, but nothing too bad.As a typical American male, I bought these without measuring, so if you have dog crates, these will fill the smallest sized one...if you buy too large, they are easily bent into a crate."
2,Do not last more than a few months,"I have now been through two of these. They look good for about 3 weeks, but after that start to loose fluff, which my dog trails through the house. They are washable, but my dogs hairs stay in the mattress. After a few months of use they are flat and stinky. While low cost, I would prefer to pay more for something that would last a year or so at a time."
2,Sheds More Than my Beagle!,"I bought a couple of these beds as crate beds for my beagles. Within the first few days we started finding big clumps of this bed around the house and in the crates. Some say they hold up well, but these fall apart very easily in my opinion. They make more of a mess than my beagles shedding does. I would not buy these again."
2,shedding problem,"When I purchased this dog bed I expected it to be thin and otherwise a little cheap, but I didn''t expect the shedding from the bed to be worse than the shedding from the dog! I hope the shedding is temporary!"
3,Pet Bed,Good product other than very thin and it does shed somewhat. No complaint as I have bought before and knew what I was getting. Nice price.
5,For my GSD pup,"This is a very nice pad. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another if needed. Fits beautifull into my mid-west 36"" crate."
3,Plastic Slippery & Loud Bottom,"My Shiba Inu loves these fleece style beds. This is the first time I've ordered one from Amazon. I didn't know that the bottom, underneath, is a plastic lining that sounds loud like a babies changing pad! When he plays or just moves around on it, it moves way too easy and slips & slides all about. Others I have purchased at local stores do not have this underneath, the fabric, or fleece, is just like what's on top. Perhaps this should be for pets that are learning to potty train still, or have the occasional accident? Although most pets don't pee where they sleep. I truly don't think the loud plastic bottom is needed. Wish it didn't come with that. Next time, sadly, I think I'll keep buying these from local stores. Had I known it had a plastic slippery bottom, I wouldn't have purchased it."
3,OK for what it is,Works as a good short-term bed or crate bed. Be warned that it pills like crazy and is easy for the dogs to pull apart during play. Not durable.
2,Crate pad made in USA,I put crate pad made in USA on Amazon search and this came up with made in USA. IT IS NOT. Very Disappointed! If you are not worried about a pad made in China then it is ok. It does smell like it was made in China! It is soaking in baking soda now!
2,cheap construction..moderate price,"The padding is basically non existent. I can easily pinch the bottom padding and feel my fingertips. The padding is about half an inch thick, maybe less. It says that it keeps dogs cool in the summer, but I dont see how fleece or synthetic sheepskin could do that. My dogs lay on the hardwood floor because its cooler. Also, it comes in a huge cardboard box that could fit a midget inside. When you open it, its about 15 square feet of paper, and 5 cubic feet of empty space."
5,Kitty loves it!,My cat loves this bed. I like that's it's portable and small so I can bring it on trips easily. Washes well too.
2,Not the Same Quality as it once was!,"I was very disappointed! I used to order this bed for my Coton de Tulear and it was a wonderfully sturdy, thick and plush fabric that lasted and lasted. I took one of these out of the bag and immediately noticed a HUGE difference in the quality! VERY POOR! It's thinner material, the backing is slippery, the so called Berber Fleece is anything but.. it all polyester and poor quality at that.. I just washed one and pieces of fleece were coming off it when I brushed it with my hand! Wow! This used to be a dependable, high quality product.. If I had seen it in a store I would never have bought it! I suppose I should return these two beds.. They certainly won't hold up to any real use at all!"
5,Dog loves it!,"I have an older dog. It's hard for her to get on regular beds or couch, that's when I decided to get the doggie bed. I thought it would be hard to get her in it cause she never had her own bed before but I find her in it all the time, she loves it. I had to wash it and the bed washed up beautifully. I was worried about the color but it holds up great. She looks adorable sleeping in it."
2,The Midwest Quiet Time Pet Bed Fleece isn't so quiet at my house.,"I bought this at the same time I purchased the FirstRax soft crate. Our dog likes to repeatedly scratch the bed with her front feet causing me to remove it from the crate. She got pieces of fleeze all over the place when I first gave it to her. Now I leave the pad on the floor in the front room and although she still scratchs it like crazy, I've also seen her curl up in it to sleep. It doesn't seem to shed as much fleeze as it did but we still can't use it in the crate. We put a small light weight baby quilt in the crate which has helped to make bed time a true ""quiet time""."
2,its ok. a little thin,"i just got it, its alright, its a bit thin, so i put some padding under it. but hey, its cheap right?"
2,Pet Bed,I purchased this pet bed for my dad's outside dog to put inside the doghouse to give her some extra warmth. It is a little thinner than what I expected. There is not much support in the bottom of the bed. I would have expected more padding. I kept it because it was not worth the price to ship back.
3,"Good, but the bed sheds","We've had this bed for about 8 months and it is generally a good product. It shed a lot at first, but now that we've washed it a few times it seems to have stopped shedding."
3,Bad for chewers and possibly puppies,"I bought this to give some padding to my new puppy's crate. He wasn't really a chewer in that I could leave shoes, purses, groceries on the floor and he'd sniff them, but wouldn't chew on them. But when I got this and put it in the crate, he seemed to love the feeling or something and would chew on it. I didn't know that he also started eating what he chewed off, but he threw up one day and it was all the fuzzy material, so I threw it away after that. The bed itself is not very cushioned and seems this, so it might be good for a smaller dog (mine was 12 lbs at the time), but I ended up purchasing a bed from Costco, and it's much more cushy and he can't seem to puncture or rip the material (he's now 18 lbs). I don't think this product is bad, it's not of the highest quality, but it just wasn't for my dog."
2,older ones better,"I bought two different sizes of these ""new"" pet beds because over the years the ones like these that I already have are so good. The last ones have lasted 5yrs but are starting to get threadbare. I read in other reviews that these new ones shed. Boy were they right. After washing after one week of use they have half the fleece they did in the beginning. It's in the bottom of the crates and in the washer. I washed them on the gentle cycle with cold water and line dried them. I'm going to have to find some other beds next time."
4,Washer & Dryer friendly!,FINALLY - a dog bed that's actually machine washable! It's a great deal for the price and especially since it won't fall apart after the 2nd wash. I plan of having this outside in the summer too since so far stains haven't stuck
4,Quiet time pet bed is okay.,"This is a very, very dark gray pet bed. My kitten does sleep in it but she's only just over 7 pounds - she's about 1.5 years. If she was any wider, I don't think this would be a perfect fit for her. It's okay but when the time comes to get another one, I'll probably look around instead of automatically re-purchasing this one."
3,thin thin thin,"Well, the dog likes to lay on it, sort of. She likes this bed does not love it. The material is soft, machine washable, but not thick at all. I can easily feel my tile through it."
4,better made than the other one I bought,"this bed is much better made than the other one I bought, it's very soft and my dog loves it. Retains it's shape well"
4,Good product for price,"I purchased two of these based on reviews. I have 5 large dogs,2 are Leonbergers so got the 48"" beds. We have not yet tried to wash such a large bed in a regular washer so can't comment on that. As others have said the middle portion of the bed is not particularly thick but we added a memory foam bath mat to it and it works great. The dogs don't seem to care one way or the other as they often lie on the bare floor. They do seem to like the rolled part that they can lay their head on. The bed is tidey and washable which beats the cedar filled beds which eventually compact and get thrown out so we will see how they do long term. That is the only reason I did not give them 5 stars because I don't know how they wash or last long term. Good bed for the money."
4,Fair,"I would say for bigger dogs this is too thin. I realize it wasn't that expensive if we look at the majority of beds. However, mine bit a hole in it right away and she prefers her more padded bed. Otherwise it does wash up nice which I appreciate."
5,My puppy loves it!!!!,This is a great product. Good quality and looks very nice! My puppy lives laying on it.. It is soft and easily washable.
2,Not good for our puppy,"I got this bed for our 14-week old puppy's crate, but it is not working for us. She enjoys pawing at her bedding (as if making a nest) and this causes the bed to release large amounts of fluff which she then chews on. I don't know if she's actually eaten any of the fluff, but it's not worth the risk so we've taken the bed away and gone back to using towels. We will try this bed again when she's a bit older. If it didn't come apart so easily it would have been exactly what we wanted."
5,Charlie loves his bed :),Got this bed to go in a crate for my new puppy. He loves his bed! Bed is also easy to wash mythrowing in washer. I recommed this bed!
4,Nice dog bed,This was a great dog bed for the price. It's very soft and seemed comfy. I only gave it 4 stars though because there was no padding on the bottom. It was just the fuzzy cover and a thin lining. You'd probably want to put some kind of rug underneath it for your dog.
2,To Thin,"In the description is says it is 3 inches think, what they didn't tell you was that the outside bolster is 3 inches. The inside is maybe an inch and that's pushing it. Going to go ahead and keep it. It's to much of a pain to send back."
1,Don't Recommend,"We purchased this for our 2 year old male Westie, for the bottom of his crate. Although it fits perfectly, is nice and cushy, and he really likes it, we have a major problem. He constantly licks it, and licks the fibers right off, which have upset his digestive system, and is causing him to vomit. The ""fleece"" comes right off the product, and ends up being injested. Perhaps the cloth versions are better, but I would not recommend this product for dogs that like to lick anything and everything, as this has rendered the bed useless."
4,Surprising,"I have to admit to being surprised how much each of my cats likes his own Quiet Time Bed. The younger one nudges the older one from his bed on the prime spot on the table that overhangs the radiator. The bottom of the bed isn't all that plush so I folded up old towels underneath. Something about these beds, I don't know what, makes the guys settle in securely! Both of them are fairly big, about 15 lbs. each, and they fit into the small 22"" X 13"" beds just fine."
2,Sheds like crazy,"This pad sheds lint balls continuously, and within a couple of months there is not much left to it. It is so thin, and about to rip apart. It was a waste of money, and now I need to buy a new one."
3,As Pictured,"It is plush, but not very padded. The sides are padded but the bottom is just plush material on top of a satin-like quilted bottom. It's soft because of the velvet, but not very soft as far as padding. I wish I spend a little more to get better padding.Against other ""beds"" I bought I would rate this a 1 or 2 star, I gave it 3 because what you see is what you get. I wanted to save money. If you can spend a little more, get your dog something more comfortable."
2,Bad recommendation,Fast delivery. I gave it 2 stars because it was the wrong size. I ordered a carrier for my cat and it recommended I buy this item to go with it. I thought that was a nice suggestion until I received it and it was way too big for the carrier. Now I have to deal with returning it.
3,Watch out if your dog likes to make a den,"Our dog likes to rearrange her bedding material. We've always used blankets so we never had any problems (the blanket is always moved around). While this bed is nice, our dog is shlowly destroying the material. If we had a more sedentary dog, then the bed would be fine."
3,"Soft, but very thin, and it pills","This bed is fleecy and soft, but it pills like crazy, and it's surprisingly thin. I am not impressed. I would not purchase this again."
2,waste of money flattens immediately and cant get out hair,"Purchased this for my black lab. It was in the trash in a few months. True the item is not padded and its very thin, but after a few weeks it pretty much flattened out to nothing. Should have saved myself the $ and just used a cheap beach towel. At least you can get the hair out of that. I washed this item many times and beat it against the house outside but there was just no way to get out the dog hairs that bad become imbedded in the curly material.Also, this is not an item flaw, but my dog chewed on the outer bumper part and pulled out all the stuffing. If you have a puppy or dog prone to that kind of behavior this is not the item for your.Overall its a waste of money. an old towel will serve exactly the same purpose."
2,Puppy ate the fuzz made from chewing it,"I read other reviews and thought it would be a good choice for my puppy, but he chewed it and ate a lot of the fuzz he was able to get off of it while chewing. We had bought another pet bed when we bought this one, and he never chews that one (Pet Dreams Plush Sleep-eez). Not good for our puppy...maybe better for dogs who are through the chewing phase."
5,Pet bed,"Pet bed was perfect size to fit the x-large remington dog crate. My dog loves it. Only flaw for this product was cleaning the washer each time you wash it. Lots of fibers left behind. Other wise, very happy with purchase."
2,Not thrilled with the quality,"I had theMidwest Quiet Time 35-By-25-Inch Ombre? Swirl Deluxe Pet Bedfor a couple of years and loved the quality - it stood up to regular machine washing, my dog's digging and anything else I would throw at it. Oh, and also pet hair doesn't show on it at all! But when I got a crate for my dog I wanted something with sides, so I went for the Quiet Time pet bed in gray. What can I say, the quality is nowhere near the Deluxe pet bed. The pilling is driving me nuts - my dog likes to scratch a bit before lying down, so now I'm finding gray clumps of nylon all over the place (they are lightweight and cling to carpets and clothes and travel all around the house). As if dog fur alone wasn't enough!I don't think I will ever be buying Midwest pet beds again after this experience."
4,Good fit,I had a hard time finding a pet bed this size that did not cost a fortune. This fits perfectly. You will need a pad or something underneath as the bed is thin but I already had one so this worked great for me.
4,Kennel Pad,"I purchased this same kennel pad from PetSmart at a more expensive price. When ordering through Amazon I thought I was getting the same pad that I previously purchased. When these pads arrived they were the same size, color, however, they were not of the same material which was a disappointment. The pad that I purchased from PetSmart was a chenelle type fabric...VERY SOFT!! The kennel pads that I purchased through Amazon was a rough synthetic material that I was disappointed with. This is a wonderful addition to any kennel but I just wish it would have been the same type of material as the first I purchased through PetSmart."
4,A nice bed,"I can't say much about this bed, because it was a gift but for the price I can say that it is HUGE and much more padded than most ""crate"" beds. It's nothing fancy, but I like that it comes in different colors. It was donated to an Adopt A Family with a dog so I have no idea how it will hold up, etc but I was pleased with the product when it arrived at my house."
3,Get your vacuum ready,"My dog likes this bed quite a bit, but I am sick of cleaning up all the pieces of fuzz that it produces. We use the bed inside his crate, but the fuzz ends up all over the floor. If you don't mind vacuuming all the time then this is a good bed for the price."
3,Amazon's Midwest Pet Bed: Too thin for a lab?,"I was disappointed that the center of the bed is as thin as it is, but the bed fit the Midwest brand wire cage perfectly. Our lab seems happiest when the bed is topped off by her old quilt - but then that blanket , like Linus's, is her favorite."
2,Fleece bed for Merry Products Large Kennel,This is the size they advertised as to fit kennel on web page. It doesn't it's to Small It's like only a medium at that.....And very thin.....
3,Decent,"Decent padding, nice and my dog liked it until she chewed it up and got the padding everywhere lol. Not really a mark on the bed I guess more on my dog."
1,"DON""T BUY","thing is a piece of junk, had 2 days and lint balls galore, China junk DON""T BUY I'd sure be afraid to wash it! I've had dogs and dog beds for them my whole life and this is the biggest cheapest piece of crap."
5,Seniors love it,My 2 golden retreivers love it. While they are sometimes jealous of each other that goes out the window when taking a snooze on the QT Pet Bed. This size holds both dogs @ 75 lbs each! Great value.
4,Good enough,I got this dog bed to get my dogs outta my bed. 1 dog loves it and the other still sleeps in my bed. I think it could be thicker for more comfort for my dogs.. but for the price this is a good product
4,Pretty Good,"Loved product for first couple months, but with a fairly active pug puppy and a few cycles in the washer and dryer, the bed has been pilling balls of fleece (which puppy then tries to eat). Probably better for grown dogs."
5,Cat's bed,Received this item in a timely manner. JB (Jingle Bell) loves it for sleeping or kneeding.
5,great dog bed,My large Pembroke Welsh Corgi took to this bed right away. He loves the soft fleece and bolsters on which he rests his head. It's lightweight and very portable.
3,not strong enough,i would not recomend this mat for any dog my dog had it tore up and the stuffing out of it with in a couple of hours its nice but it don't stand up
2,Leaves fuzzies everywhere,"Well the dog likes it, but the material causes fuzzies to get everywhere. It's made of that fleece, lamb-wool looking material and it separates easily from the bed itself. I'm buying one made of something else."
4,Nice and compact,I bought this for our 5 month old pointer mix (22 lbs). Put it on the floor of the minivan between the two front seats so she has a place to rest during car trips. It's nice because it gives her a place that's hers and keeps her from wandering around the car. I like that it's all one part. The other bed she has in her crate has a pillow in it and I don't like that as much.
4,Dog bed for crate,"As the weather gets colder, we didn't want our new husky to sleep on the bare metal floor of his crate. This dog bed is reasonably priced. Its not very thick, and it sheds all over the place. Exactly appropriate for a husky. At first he didn't know what to make of it and stood on it instead of lying down. He finally figured it out, and sleeps nicely on it. The first thing he did was chew off all the labels and little tabs that were sewn on. Sometimes he crumples the bed up and lies on the bare metal floor of his crate anyway. I haven't tried washing it yet. I'm afraid all the material it sheds will clog our washer. It fits the crate, and is easy to shake out, and to vacuum. I looked at some dog beds on other web sites, but this was the most reasonable in price. It was sent promptly and was well packaged. I wish it was a bit thicker."
5,buy it,very good product my kids were fighting over who gets to sleep in it lol may have to buy another one
4,Bed for an old dog.,My older dog has arthritis and has trouble getting up on the bed where she has always slept. She will quietly sleep in this which is on my side of the bed for the better part of the night.With her pillow and blanket she remains peacefully at sleep without feeling abandoned.
2,don't get it in fleece,I bought this item in fleece and for the first few weeks it was great. My dog used to play a lot on it and over time it accumlated bits of bone/nylabone that wouldn't come out even when vacuumed. This made it very uncomfortable for him to lie on and he'd scratch himself silly. It became even more disgusting when it got wet... But that's most likely due to the fact that it was fleece.
4,Great book!,"If this was just a Christy/Sierra book, then I would give it a full five stars. But, since it's got Cooper Ellis, it only gets four.Not that Cooper wasn't good. It was OK. I wasn't a fan of Wendy Lee's writing. But, Robin! She is one of my favorite authors, so I loved her books in here! The only complaint was no Todd :( Oh, well, I'll just have to wait on him until ""Until Tomorrow"" arrives in my mailbox. But, the guy that was in here was great and the whole book was romantic. Nothing like when Todd is around, but really good.One amazing thing about Robin is that she can make each character have his or her own personality. So many writers have all the characters the same. Robin is a huge exception. Her characters are wonderful!I enjoy her books tremendously! Keep up the great work, Robin!"
4,Departures,"I was excited for the chance to review this title in exchange for my honest opinion of the book! I grew up reading the Christy Miller series and then later the Sierra Jensen series. Departures is a story that was rediscovered by the author Robin Jones Gunn this year as she was packing up boxes to move. The story was only available for a short while and so Robin decides to make it available again. The book has 2 parts. In the first story, we follow Christy Miller as she has just said goodbye to Todd. She joins her family on a vacation back to the Midwest and we see her encounter a long lost crush. It's a fun, lighthearted story of Christy depending on the Lord and finding herself in the process. In the second story, we watch Sierra Jensen as she goes on vacation with her friend Jana. Sierra doesn't feel ready to grow up and be involved in relationships. We watch as she comes to peace with who she is and what God has in store for her. This book is a great, easy read."
5,A Very Good Buy,I bought this book used and very cheap and wasn't really sure what to expect with such a good price. I was pleasantly suprised when I recieved a book that looked like it was brand new! I will definetly buy from Amazon.com again.
2,Disappointing,"I love many of Robin Jones Gunn's books for us ladies, so I ordered this book for teens to see if it would be a good gift but I was disppointed, and for the price would not recommend it. I would rather give her ""SisterChick""s books to the teens I know."
5,"A fun, quick read.","This book will give you a couple of hours of very pleasant reading. It's a nice sexy story about nice people. The heroine wasn't the sharpest crayon in the box, but that's not exactly unusual for this genre. This makes a great airplane read."
5,I Just Love A Good Chase!,"Janelle Denison has done it again! Now there is Seduced, a Harlequin Blaze, and people, that is exactly how you feel reading certain scenes in this book; ablaze! Ryan Matthews has been chasing afer Jessica Newman for a long time and you will never believe the tactics he goes through to get this woman; Better Than Sex cake, a Chocolate Mocha Rapture cake, her as a willing test subject in a romantic bathroom gift for friends, and a wild passionate night.... no wonder she fell in love. I promise you will love this novel as much as I did."
2,STUPID!,"Let's face it, this is pretty much Nascar 99. It has like 1 new track, and a few new racers. THAT's IT! Don't waste your money on it!"
1,Rentals only.,"This game is fun for a while, but what it seems like is PlayStation graphics slapped onto an N64 GamePak. I would only rent this for a weekend, for it will collect dust in your closet before you know you've wasted over $40. If you've ever tried Sierra Sports' Nascar Racing 1999 Edition, this only has a little arcade touch to it. Also, the voice commentary of Bob Jenkins and Benny Parsons matches that of NASCAR Revolution. It only says something like your lap was faster, ouch, or ""What a day for racing."" You mean what a boring game, Benny?"
3,Not what I would expect from a racing game.,"After renting this game, I was very dissapointed of it's overall game play. I found the graphics were nothing spiecial, the game was just plain-out boring, with no (big jumps) found in the rush series or the garaphics found in World Driver Championship, which I didn't expect in a stock car racer, but they could have made it a little more interesting with bigger crashes and maybe some better music. If you really want a racer I wouldn't recomend a stock car racer and if you really want one, rent it first."
2,Only Two Songs!,"My opinion is purely subjective here. But, there are only two songs on this entire CD that I like. Oh well."
3,Not impressed,"I don't know how this product compares to others, but if there isn't anything better out there, it would be scary. The nail clippers are pathetic, the bulb syringe is useless and the emery boards are only good for one nail filing. The only thing I have found to be decent is the tooth brushes for my 1 year old to suck on while I change his diapers and the measuring syringe (although, even that, the measurements are rubbing off after only a few uses so, soon, we will not be able to tell how much we're measuring)."
5,Pleasant surprise,"I have both of Fournier's versions (with Gulda & with Kempff), and the Richter/Rostropovich, all of which I loved and listened to quite often. However, since aquiring this set, I find myself going to it rather more than the others. Believe me, I'm extremely but pleasantly surprised by how good this set is. I had never heard of Perenyi, and Schiff has never been my favorite pianist, but these guys sound as if they have been playing together forever. Whatever you may think of the highly acclaimed sets above, this one deserves to be heard."
2,Howard Shore synthesized,"""Music from The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" contains renditions of several pieces from Howard Shore's Oscar-winning score to the recent Peter Jackson film performed by the Hollywood Studio Orchestra & Singers. The original soundtrack release is far superior to this, mainly because the score of the current recording sounds like it was realized with synthesizers. The result is a much shallower, artificial sound. However, the choral portions are real human voices, and their rendition is sufficiently different from the original soundtrack to warrant attention. In particular, many of the vocals are much clearer and easier heard than on the film version."
1,should be illegal to do this,totally fake synthesizer versions of these great songs -- should be illegal to do this.totally fake synthesizer versions of these great songs -- should be illegal to do this.
4,Wake - same old same old,"I love the music, DCD are so hypnotic and this is as good as any other album - oh wait, it IS the music that's on any other album ... and that's my criticism. Almost every track I recognised from Toward the Within or Silver Tree, both of which I love and play regularly.It is a good album anyway and I would recommend it to anyone who isn't sure whether they will like DCD - a very good introduction to the work of these amazing musicians, especially Lisa Gerrard who has an incredible vocal range and great skill in composition."
5,Great movies,great movies in one compact case makes more room for more movies on my shelve that makes it easier to get more movies.
2,Wow! I wasn't impressed at all.,"I was intrigued by the premise of this book. And then I read it. The story would become too laden with facts about Hermes Trismegistus or Cromwell that my eyelids would droop. Alethea was never fully fleshed out to me and even Inchbold, I am not sure, if I were in his shoes, if I would have even become involved. What did he see in her anyway? She seemed kind of like a lunatic or at least eccentric. And the ending-- anyone ever read The Fall of the House of Usher... just too fantastic!"
4,book about books,"What can I say I am a sucker for books about books? As with many of them it could be said to be about books being destroyed by people or groups that disagreed with them. Each time I read of another great library being destroyed it makes me think of all that we have lost, and how and when is it going to happen again, hopefully not in my lifetime. This is a good story with enough references to history and a cornucopia of rare and historic books set most recently in London in 1660."
2,Wish I'd paid more attention to the reviews,"I was actually enjoying this book until I reached the end. Then I was mad that I'd spent time reading it. The ending just does not fit the build up, and is a major let down.There appeared to be excellent research into the the historical time period. The swiftly changing political structure was presented in a manner that fit the story and provided the reader a framework to understand how certain books were seen as dangerous, politically threatening or valuable assets. However, the mysterious quest that the ""hero"" goes on ends up being laughable. It seemed to be used more for the author to demonstrate his understanding of the political structure of the times.I would recommned ""The Name of the Rose"" instead of this book. It is a far superior read."
4,I Finished It!,"Tedious going in alot of places. More conversation would have made a better book for those not as knowledgeable about ancient texts as Mr King. The ending is really hard to get through. I found the dialogue there unbelievable. Maybe I missed something, but whatever happened to Emilia, who thought she was pregnant? That certainly looked promising. You really can't compare it to ""The Instance of the Fingerpost"" and ""Club Dumas""'which I think are much better books. I've bought ""Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling"" and hope it is better."
3,About the Great Fire&#65533;,"I enjoyed what I read, but ran out of time, so I scanned the rest. But if you're put off by the historical ""error"" regarding the Great Fire of London in a previous review, as I was, consider this: The Great Fire of London in 1666 started in a baker's shop in Pudding Lane and reached the London Bridge. But the bridge itself was mostly untouched because of gaps on the bridge from a previous fire. It is quite believable that, in 1700, one could sit in a bookshop on the bridge that had been unaffected by the fire."
2,horribly overrated,"While the author knows how to fill a page with fine descriptions and mini-events, he fails terribly when it counts most. There are silly transitions and unbelievable turning points throughout. In addition, he does not know when to streamline and when to flesh out. I read carefully for a hundred pages, I skimmmed the next hundred and stopped reading around pg 230. I absolutely do not understand the glowing reviews by some professional critics. He is NOT an Iain Pears."
3,An ingenious intellectual Puzzle?,"Newsday calls this book an ingenious intellectual puzzle. Maybe I am not so untellectual as I think.I did like this book but found it a bit of a chore to read. About halfway through I noticed the quote on the front cover by the ""Denver Free Press"" that compares it to ""The Name of the Rose"". the only similarity is that there are books involved and a bit of a puzzle to figure out. Other than that, different century, different location, great characters.The characters are a bit flat, the main characters, Isaac Inchbold and Emilia could have been given a bit more depth.All in all, not a bad read but not a page turner either."
1,An Irritatingly Disappointing Waste of Time...,"I bought this book with high hopes. I slogged through four hundred pages of overwrought prose and recondite (and often contrived) references. Again and again I battled back the thickening boredom. I vowed not to lay the book aside because I was sure that Mr. King would bring it all together in some interesting and meaningful flourish. Gawdalmighty, was I wrong. This book is a massive and insulting waste of time. And the insult is aggravated by the showy-learned tone of the whole thing. I have never read any other books by Mr. King. And he can rest assured I never will."
4,Cool one...,"Love the stove for its ease of use ... Being a vegan, this has become our companion for any long road trip."
3,"decent stove, but way too expensive","decent stove, good heat output at high flow, sloppy heat regulation at low flow. Way too expensive for what you get, and MADE IN CHINA. Should be around $10."
5,Great little stove,"I bought this for one reason. I use it to make coffee in the morning, outside our trailor when we camp. Easy to use, and it's Coleman so it's well made."
4,Great little stove.,"This is a great stove for camping. At first I was concerned about weight the stove would be able to stand, since tall items are usually unstable. This was not a problem. I was able to boil water on a percolator without a problem. I later boiled water in a regular sized pot and once again no worries about it tipping over. Other than the fact that you need a match to light it, the stove is great. Lighting it is simple and easy but of course I would prefer a matchless option. If it had a matchless option it would have go 5 stars from me."
4,big but powerful,"this stove, like all coleman products works great and is very stable. however, be warned that it is a bit big and not good for backpacking. great for car camping. and great value!"
3,Almost Packable Stove,"The stove works like a charm. Plastic base holds gas cylinder well, burner top is stable, and the burner produces plenty of heat. The system would be much better for me however, if some form of padded bag or cover was included to cover the burner while stowed in a pack or cycle pannier between uses."
2,"Cannot remove, reuse the Gas Cylinder","While this stove creates plenty of heat and will do so under wet, windy conditions. The few times i have used it, when I was finished with the stove, and removed the gas cylinder for transport. The Cylinder SEALS were compromised and leaked until the cylinder was EMPTY. I have several other stoves which use the same cylinders and NONE of them compromise the cylinder seals. Dangerous waste of fuel and a definite weakness in stove function.."
3,The picture is deceptive.,"Watch out: this item only includes the stove part, no the fuel cylinder. If you want to buy it, you will have to buy Coleman cylinder. The vendor should makes it more clear which part is NOT included, so the custmor can compare with similar items fairly."
1,No tank,"I dont know if I did not read correctly but I received this stove without the tank, therefore it was useless for me, I never imagined that the tank needs to be bought separated, the product loos very very good quality, if I receive the tank I would have rated 5 stars but no tank, 1-star because of that"
5,"Gift to Brother, silence means he LOVES it!!","My brother took up trucking to pay the bills, he was looking for a way to cook his meals to save money so I got him this stove. He hasn't said anything about it and for him that means he loves it. If there was a problem I always hear, silence = love. Glad I got it for him."
4,Works just fine!,"This served its purpose well on its first camping.Strong flame, stable base and wide enough to hold most kitchen utensils.The only drawbacks are:1. Doesn't have an electric lighter (have to light manually with a matchstick)2. The knob to control the flame might have been useful if it was finer (allowed to set for really thin flame)"
3,Great Stove .... but,"On a recent backpacking trip our group was loaned this stove to use for cooking our meals at each stop. I have to say, I worked like a charm. We had no trouble getting it started. It heated water like a dream. It was windy and there were no 'blow out' issues. The pot sat on the stand evenly, without even the tiniest of tipping.Now my con: It was a little big for us to pack out. I own the Pocket Rocket, which I didn't bring because I was out of fuel, and really wished I had it with just for the size consideration.If you are simply camping and only need a one burner stove. This may be the one for you."
5,Emergency Preparedness Supplies,"Purchased this stove for our family to use as part of our emergency backup supplies.This stove is easy to store,and 1lb bottles of Propane are very easy to store! We have two of these stoves to provide the ability to cook and heat water for meals or what ever you need in case of an Emergencysituation!The stove is almost like your stove top at home as far as flame adjustabiliy,simmer to boil!Of course you would need to have plenty of ventilation if you use the stove inside your home.The nice thing to is it could be used in your family car camping trips!Coleman still makes a quality product in this day and age even though this product is made overseas.Did I mention the price that Amazon has for this item,right now it's 18.99 with free regular shipping!That is awesome!! Amazon would like to say ""Thank You"" for the Great Service and fast shipping of this great product."
5,Delivery of Scotts Basic Broadcast Spreader,Scotts Basic Broadcast Spreader #74101Excellent service. Delivered on time and in good condition. Have enjoyed the spreader-no complaints whatsoever.Tatiana
2,The old green spreader ain't what it used to be,"The wheel broke as the spreader was being assembled and Scotts hasn't seen fit to send the replacement they promised. With snow on the ground now, it's not that important but I'd say old Scotts is not quite up to par."
1,Junk ... axle locks up and handle doubles over,"These are junk ... the last one I'll buy from Home Depot or Lowes ... the axle/rotor mechanism doesn't work well and the handle, while made to disassemble easily and fold, is a severe weakness of the unit. It's very frustrating to be pushing 25 lbs of fertilizer only to have the axle lock-up and spill half of the load on the lawn - it burns the grass and is time consuming to clean up. Scotts has low brand reputation with me ... words like ""cheap"" and ""consumer grade"" and ""Made in China"" come to mind ... boy something more commercial grade and use it for years to come, that's my plan."
4,Guidelines,"Really well structured book, from station security (by operating system), protecting APs, to build a gateway with firewall rules taking into consideration all the protocols necessary for a wireless station operation.A must have co-authored by the founder of The Shmoo Group."
3,Decent coverage of 802.11 security,"This book provides the basic coverage of 802.11 security that the casual user would want, but leaves the information security professional wanting more. The pain point for this book is the price point and the amount of information covered. For the list price, most readers would expect much more in depth coverage of the topic including ancillary information such as monitoring for unusual activity, etc. To be fair, the author doesn't include this in the scope, but a book ambitiously titled 802.11 security in conjunction with the price, would leave the impression that there was more comprehensive coverage of other issues surrounding wireless deployment.Not a bad book, just not what was expected when comparing to other O'Reilly books."
4,Saves Time!,"I disagree with the other reviewer. While it's true that this book has a large collection of URL's that *could* be found using a search engine, the fact that the authors took the time to find the resources mentioned, cull through them, and published them, saves a beginner a significant amount of time weeding out the good hits from the zillion or so mediocre ones.The book is well worth the money for anyone contemplating running a wireless network with some flavor of *nix, or even, (God forbid) Windoze. Sample configurations for both servers and clients are given, and aside from a few typos between the text and the diagrams, is quite complete for anyone with a modicum of system administration knowledge."
1,Terrible,The live recording of the Diabelli Variations by Grigory Sokolov is amazing. It took me a long time to track down a recording of this work that I'm entirely satisfied with. I feel that Richter plays the Diabelli Variations far too quickly. Just listen to the last variation to see what I mean. The less said about Anderszewski the better.
3,Tempo,"I heard Piotr Anderszewki play the Diabelli Variations last night, in a concert at Ann Arbor Michigan, where he replaced the Hagen Quartet, who sadly cancelled their North American tour.What I'm curious about here is the tempo. Another recent purchase was Maurizio Pollini's recording of this music. The Pollini set comes in at 50:08, the Anderszewski at 63:10. Why is there such a large discrepancy in timing?Michael"
5,"""Habit Forming""","""It"" Happens! can be habit forming. I recommend it to my employees, family, and friends. ""It"" Happens! will inspire and keep people motivated and better able to manage change as well as teach them how to create a happier workplace or home."
3,Okay,"Two issues: They don't stand on their feet well w/o persistent manipulation. The clothes do not come off & this is a turnoff for little kids who love to dress and undress. I recommend Evie dollhouse dolls, better made and their clothes are not only designed to be removed but you can buy extra outfits for them. They're not cheap, but are worth it."
4,Small price haevy Weight.,"This TV is Great. The only down fall is that it is heavy. The picture is clear and bright with no bluring at all. The adjment menue is simlpe and easy to understand. Every thing is better on this TV(dvd,XBOX,even vhs). The High Def. erra is here and this is a cheap back door route to take. If your more thrifty than picky this the way to go given that the set is so big but it still looks pretty cool. So If size and weight are not important this is the tv for you. Happy lifting:^)"
5,Very Nice Flash Cards,"These are very nice flash cards. Note - they are not laminated (as stated in the product description), so they won't take a huge amount of abuse, but for home use they are fine."
3,"OK, but disappointed with paper quality","The flashcards are suitable for what they are meant for. However, I was hoping for a product with a more sturdier paper quality. Maybe even laminated to keep them free of dirt."
1,Poorly designed flash cards,"The answers on the rear are rotated 90 degrees clockwise which means that as the student views the front, the person holding the card must read the answers sideways! I bought these to use by myself which means I must turn the card toward myself and then rotate the card 90 degrees counter clockwise. These cards could not have been designed worse!"
4,Sturdy but with some lame parts,"For cardboard, these bankers boxes are sturdy. The steel frames are a good addition. However, the following parts are pretty lame and can use some improvements:1. The plastic handle. Functional, but ugly. A bit hard to insert into the holes through all layers.2. The plastic rails. They don't always fit tightly on the drawers.3. Additional handle support. Cheap idea that seems to work, but there has to be a better solution. Anyway, I am not too fond of the plastic handle to begin with.4. The graphics on the front of the drawer is ugly. Plain white looks better.Overall, good product. Economical solution to my storage needs."
3,Nice but temporary,"These are good for what they are. Temporary storage. They don't come with the clips people talk about and I haven't ordered them. Therefore, the top drawers are prone to fall over. I use these in my basement and I worry that if I get a water leak, these will get soggy and fall apart....thus, I consider them temporary. Otherwise, they are very functional."
2,OK but very expensive for what you get.,"These are basically stackable cardboard (reinforced) storage boxes They are strong and well made, work pretty well, and get the job done. However, I think the price is *very* expensive for what you get. I use them in a walk-in closet and they work ok for that purpose."
3,"Functional, but nothing to look at","These cardboard file cabinets are functional and great for backroom storage, however, they are fairly unattactive and not something you would want in plain view in a nice office.Each drawer has one square metal ring to reinforce the structure, but they are still not as sturdy as I expected. Two metal rings per shelf might have helped here. These should be fine for storing paper, but I doubt they would hold up beyond 4 levels if you plan to put anything heavier in them.Assembly is easy, but the instructions (consisting of simple drawings of a few easy-looking steps) are not as clear as they should be. I consider myself fairly intellegent, but I couldn't figure it out from the pictures as illustrated. I finally stopped looking at the them and through trial and error got it together in a few minutes.In summary, these are functional for paperwork. If you are concerned about looks you are better off putting the money towards a metal or wooden file cabinet."
4,Order the clips!,"These boxes were fairly easy to assemble along with their sleeves. Each file drawer has its own sleeve and if you order the free butterfly clips, they will attach to each other, sleeve to sleeve. (Thank you to a previous reviewer who reported how she ordered the clips). The clips make the stack of five drawers more sturdy and stable. (The recommendation is to not stack higher than 5.) The 6th box will go into the attic for extra ""deep"" storage.The file boxes are doing what I hoped and expected them to. They provide a compact way of organizing papers we need to keep but don't need to look at very frequently.I will mention I had some difficulty with obtaining the clips. When I finally got a response, customer service reported my first 2 emailed requests were not received. After contact was made, the clips arrived within a short period of time."
4,Worth is for the price!,"My dad bought this for me, when I sister stole my mouse and moved to Sacramento. It's a great keyboard/mouse set! For $30, it's definitely worth it. Range is okay, if you're using it near your desk and looking just to remove the running wires. Anyway, the cons: the software installs spyware/adware on your computer secretly. I had a firewall and it told me all this. That's the reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5, because of the spware/adware installation."
3,Worked great for 1 1/2 years but then no tech support from Logitech!,"I had been very happy with wireless Express keyboard and mouse. Recently the keyboard quite working. As is noted in other reviews, receiver only comes with PS-2 plugs which my HP laptop does not have but my docking station does have. So it has worked fine until now. But now that it doesn't work, Logitech says they won't support it because it is not connected directly to the laptop! Very disappointing for a company I had come to respect and expected better warranty support. So much for the 5-year warranty!"
2,"Great price, but the left mouse button SQUEAKS!","I'll start with the positive. The price was great and the keyboard has a nice feel to it. Other than a somewhat loud spacebar, the keyboard is pretty solid.Despite the good price, I would NOT buy this desktop unless you don't plan to use the mouse. The left mouse button makes an annoying squeaking sound almost everytime I click it, making the mouse virtually unusable. At first I thought it was just a defective mouse, but after reading some reviews I learned that the problem was pretty common with this model. I figured with Logitech's reputation I didn't need to worry about the mouse working, but I assumed wrong. I'm writing this review in hopes that someone will see the warning I didn't bother looking for. Don't do it - spend the extra money and get a better mouse! Also worth mentioning, this is a PS2 desktop (not USB) so make sure you have a PS2 port before purchasing (most notebooks don't now)."
1,No good,Mouse driver jumpy and erratic.Keyboard has no leds for caps lock and num lock. Inexcusable.Layout of page up key set is non-standard. Do you really want a non standard keyboard layout?This is a real mess. I feel I was robbed.
2,Scroll wheel does not work with all applications,"(...)this is a good price for a wireless keyboard/mouse system. I am generally happy with my purchase but I have issue with the scrol wheel. It appears the scroll wheel only work with internet browser. I can't seem to get it work with some other application (like work processor, spreadsheet). I only got this for a weeks, may be there is set up or driver issue i need to work out yet."
3,Nice Combo except for Squeeky Mouse,Very nice keyboard. But mouse has a squeek when key is pressed. Annoying. Reading reviews on the web I noticed other users complaining of this. This is something Logitech should look in to.
4,Good read,This was for my husband and he seemed to like the book but wasn't riveted to it. He had seen the movie and liked it and wanted to read the book as well.
4,This Revenge Novel Exceptionally gratifying,"Revenge is golden, like the bloodstained golden crucifix around Creasy's neck. The movie was excellent and so is this book on which it was based!Read and you will enjoy, I assure you!"
3,A good book,"Well, any of you who read my reviews know that I tend to give top reviews. that's because I do A LOT of research before I buy ANYTHING! So I tend to be happy with what I buy. Now, this book IS a good book. But, this is one of the few times I can honestly say that I enjoyed the movie more, (the one with Denzel Washington, not Scott Glenn, oof was that one garbage! and I love Scott Glenn as an actor!).Standing alone, if I had not seen the movie before, I would have rated it higher. Although the technical and some of the tactical aspects of the book are bang-on, (pun intended)!I do recommend the book, just not that highly."
2,Not Very Well Done,"The problem with this book is that it got off to a good start, but then crashed. There were interesting excursions into the training regimen of the modern French Foreign Legion and also life in Malta, where some of this book took place. But the book was mostly devoid of suspense. Not compelling at all. The author's a good writer, but he needs to go back to school on structuring a book that grabs and holds the reader's interest."
2,Well written but that's about it,"Slow paced until two-thirds into the story, much time unnecessarily spent on Creasy's pre-revenge training, and a third act which, though fast paced, remains somewhat devoid of genuine surprises. In all, a well-written but quickly forgettable book."
2,Basic Theodore Roosevelt Nat'l Park,"This book was recommended by the superintendent of the T.R. Nat'l Park. It might suffice for an elementary school level, but I expected a bit more."
2,"TIny, tiny product","Quality product but it is much, much smaller than the photo believes you to think it will be. Not full size gum packages."
1,Way too pricy,"This is a Japanese bubble gum that can be bought at Japanese, Korean, and Chinese stores in the US at a way cheaper price. It was less than a half at China town when I last bought them which was about couple of months ago."
1,Disgusting,"First of all, this is a tiny pack of 7 pieces of gum. I thought it was 7 multiple packs. Anyway, I put a piece in my mouth and at first it tasted like wax. Then I got the unusually sweet flavor that lasted for a few seconds and promptly spit it out. Disgusting. And grossly overpriced!"
1,Waste of money !,I would have loved to have known the size of the package and a little more discription of the product . DIscription should include that there are only a few tiny pieces of gum in the entire package . Also that when your children spend their own money on it and they waut and get it in finally that they will be crying because they are so sad about the quantity (lack there of) of gum . Thank goodness for returns !
1,I had a different idea...,"I bought this gum because i LOVE gum and i wanted to try something different. When package arrived i was very disappointed. I was under the illusion that there where there seven pieces in each box.I was disturbed my the image on the inside rapper on the frog gum (It didn't taste like frog)the image was a naked female robot.Overall i don't thing another human being should buy/ waste money of this crappy gum.Consumer,Moppy21Marukawa - Seven Pack Bubble Gum Sampler"
3,Tasty but tiny!,"I love this gum, but the packs are so small! Shipping is more than the price of this item, but the combined price of shipping and cost of the product make it too expensive (for only a few pieces of gum!) The orange, strawberry, grape, and melon gum packs have between 4 and 5 pieces of gum in each (smaller than a mento) and the other three packs are single pieces of gum (like a piece of bazooka).If you really love this kind of gum, I suggest getting a bigger package!"
3,a ridiculous price to pay to sample flavors,"be prepared for tiny boxes of gum with about four teeny pieces of gum in each flavor. although the gum is very flavorful and unique the price paid to sample flavors is extreme. i ordered individual flavors of orange, grape and strawberry at much cheaper prices and was happy with these afterwards."
3,"Really good, but doesn't last long and there's not much in the box","It arrived not exactly quick but not slow, but that's only because I chose free shipping. The flavors are delicious and taste like real fruit but don't last long. I know it's a sampler pack but they need normal pack sizes that are bigger and last longer. Overall, I think this gum is better than any other American gum."
2,okay,"this gum is good at first but the flavor fades way to quick. then theres tiny packs with about 4 ppices of gum in every flavor. it left a werid resido on my teeth and it can be bought at the local asain store for .99, your paying to much for something that isnt that good. id recommend you not buy this but if really want to try this try it at a cheaper price"
3,No flavor after 20 seconds.,"Let me just get to the chase. The gum is sticky, small, and very wierd afterwards. Im glad it was just a sample, because I am not getting this ever again. I would stick with Bubblicous and Bazooka for life."
2,where's the rest??!!!,"The gums were good but for $4.95, I was expecting more. I had a good laugh with i read the foam insert under one of the sampler boxes, which read: NOT EDIBLE. OMG! if they have to tell you its because everyone expects more out of the package.Thanks for the good flavors and the laugh."
2,hmmm?,can't rally put a label on this one... other then it's definatly NOT in my rotation of 80's metal cd's..
1,Brokw after 1 use.,"I loved this bow when I received it. It was beautiful and went with a lot of my daughters outfits. Unfortunately, it broke after the first use. she is only 18 months and does not have thick hair, Needless to say I was extremely disappointed. I think this bow should be put on an alligator clip."
2,For experienced sailors,"I think this book would be much more appreciated by experienced sailors. As an armchair enthusiast with only a small amount of sailing knowledge I was quickly bogged down with all of the technical jargon. I never got that feeling of being ""there"" and identifying with the people and the crises that I had hoped for."
1,HO7 error,"Stay away from this machine. The minute you get the ""HO7"" error, you will regret ever spending a penny on it. I need to buy a new player now, at a time I can least afford it!"
2,Will never buy a panasonic again,"I got the HO7 error code too -- supposedly means the motor has a problem. I've had this DVD player for about 4 years. I expect them to last longer than that. Also, I'm sick of the machine's delayed DVD eject -- you have to wait like 5 seconds for the DVD to eject after you push the button."
2,Panasonic worked for a year and a half,"I was really pleased with my Panasonic DVD player until it stopped working tonight. It kept showing an HO7 error...I did a little research hoping it was a dirty disk or something, but it seems to be a failed motor issue, and alot of people are reporting it. Thought I would add my name to the list.Joel"
2,Good while it lasts.,"My roomate bought this DVD player and it worked VERY well for about 10 months, until it suddenly started up with a ""HO7"" error and refused to play any disc. I did a search online for the HO7 error and I was surprised to see that it was not only a major problem, but that it seemed to be a very common complaint with this model. If you're considering buying one of these because of the price, you're probably better off in the long run just paying the extra money for a better brand."
1,Breaks after 1 year-You have been warned,"I bought this model (DVD-RP62S) in Jan 2003. Today it came up with an error ""H07"". Do a Google search on ""H07"" ""Panasonic"" and see how many people who have bought several Panasonic DVDs and after 1 year have this error come up. I expected more from them! My friend's cheap $30 off name dvd player is still running after 3 years. I will not be purchasing another Panasonic until they fix this motor problem."
1,It worked for about 10 months.,"Then died with the dreaded ""H07"" error, which, apparently means that the drive motor died. Apparently, this is a common problem with all Panasonic DVD players (Google ""panasonic h07"" to find out how many people have this problem). If you are frustrated with the laack of customer service (their automated phone system just keeps hanging up on me), register your complaint at www.bigclassaction.com. Really, it's the only way to find out how pervasive this problem is and if those who have been swindled into buying a Panasonic DVD player are willing to make them take responsibility for producing poor products."
2,"looks good, but it might break too soon",I bought a Panasonic DVD-RP82 - really nice progressive scan performance. At the nine month mark it stopped working - error code H02. Do a google search - there are as many hits as you want to read about this failure in many different Panasonic DVD players. If the RP56 has the same mechanism (it is some sort of mechanical/motor failure) it will probably fail also.
1,Don't buy the RP62S DVD player,"I purchased a Panasonic DVD-RP62 progressive scan DVD player for my HDTV setup. It was the most expensive of the others being displayed, so I figured it was probably the most functional (had more features). I found this to be wrong ...It does not play any of the rewritable DVD formats, like DVD-RW and DVD+RW. Since DVD writers are popping up everywhere, and many of my friends already have DVD writers on their PCs, it's hard to imagine an expensive DVD player NOT playing rewritable discs.I found a Sony model that for the same price does play the DVD rewritables.So once again, price does not mean the same as features.Make sure your progressive scan DVD player play a variety of computer writable media type BEFORE you buy it!"
4,quite good,"it doesn't have a coaxial output for audio (just an optical port), and you can't record your mp3's and wma's on a DVD-R disk, but otherwise it is great for the price"

4,G Love comes back with another good album,"I really enjoy this album and I think that everyone else will too. I was sort of expecting more of a hip-hop feel, more Philadelphonic style, but I was impressed with his lack back style this time. If you are a G-Love fan this album is a must. Jasper makes his first return as well in a great track called ""parasite."" ... . G Love is one of my favorite artists and he backs up the his other four albums very well. I particularly enjoyed a song called ""rain jam."" It was incredible, simple and astoudingly beautiful. The rest of the album too. ... ."
1,What Happened?!?,"I am so disappointed in this CD!! I don't know what all the other reviewers listened to, but I can't disagree more. I have been a great fan of this band for years, but compared to their others, this is a terrible CD. I hope they soon recover from whatever has possessed them. And what is the deal with the Magic Rings?? That's the worst song I've heard in a long time."
4,Good Stuff,"Definitely a good chill out album. Touches back on some the original albums but a little mellower, less talky. Reminds me a bit of G. Love's friend, Jack Johnson, with a few more instruments. I don't know, what you want to read. If you like G. Love then you'll like this cd."
2,Swing and a miss.... Philadelphonic is much much better,"I am a big G Love fan, and I think the band is extremely talented, but the songs on this album simply aren't that great. Many of them are repetitive, and boring.If you want to buy your first G Love cd, buy Philadelphonic. Philadelphonic is outstanding with the exception of 2-3 tracks. Before you know it you will be tapping your feet, singing along, and craving more.... that is why electric mile is a let down."
1,"Whoa, whoa, whoa --- what happened???","One minute you're sitting there thinking that G. Love can do no wrong with his patented approach to funky blues/rap... and then he releases The Electric Mile. Earth to G., what happened???Although I can't explain it, I've decided that there are exactly two kinds of G. Love albums: the knockouts like ""Philadelphonic,"" ""The Hustle,"" and the debut album that bowl you over with their jazzy, laid-back rhythms from start to finish, and the one or two where they've turned all the dials to ""suck."" The good news is that most of their CD's fall into the former category; the bad news is that if you start with a disc as lame as ""The Electric Mile"" you may never want to give these guys another chance, and that'd be a shame.All I remember about this disc is selling it off in horror after 3 or 4 listens, as it was just lifeless, uninspired and boring, which is not what this band is about. If you're interested in checking out G. Love, do yourself a favour and start elsewhere."
5,A Different Groove For The G-Man,"I really love this album. It's not the usual goofy rapper ramblings about Philly like previous albums...it's much deeper...a logical aftershock from Philadelphonic. Although initially I thought it was kinda superficial, it really grows on you and it's dripping with soul. When you consider that Lemonade and The Hustle came after this album, this is just a creative break for G.Love...an experiment...awesome!"
3,Marvin,"Like most of G's later albums this album has a few hits and a bunch of misses. If your like me and love the first album, enjoy the next two and can't stand Philadelphonic, this one's some where in between. It's a little to pop laced for my tastes but sometimes it fits, if your in the right mood."
5,The best!,"Without doubt, the best gay book I have ever read. It really portrays gay life in Australia perfectly, and is a moving, interesting and a brilliant story."
5,Not for the weak of heart,"I finished Holding the Man last evening. The final 10 pages took me an hour to read. My mind was racing and yes there were tears in my eyes.This is an amazing chronicle of love found and love lost, found and lost again. I was left wondering if I will ever find such a strong connection with another person in my lifetime. I believe that I actually developed a reader's crush on John. My firends who knew him tell me that he was as virtuous as portrayed.One note of caution for non Australian readers. This book relies heavily on the use of Aussie slang.Highly recommended."
3,Plot a little contrived but the acting is excellent,"The story is a little contrived. Part of the plot doesn't make sense. For instance, after the rape, how could Francois, the rapist simply just walks free as if nothing had happened? As Christian, the victim is not killed, why doesn't he go to the police straight away and put Francois behind a slammer? It also taxes our imagination a little to see Christian, a physically vibrant young man being subdued relatively easy by a passed the prime Francois, the older guy's hefty size not withstanding. But the saving grace of the film is the acting. It's sublime. Everyone on the cast does an excellent job."
1,DO FILMS COME ANY MORE TEDIOUS THAN THIS ONE?,I had read a lot about how great this film was but was extremely disappointed after seeing it.The acting was superb but the story unfolded at a most tedious pace.The so called shocking climax actually came before the end and it wasn't shocking as we had seen it many times before in other films.The fact that the victim did nothing to stop the outrage puzzled me.It truly was the most tedious film I have encounterd in many a year.The outstanding acting from the leading man was the film's only merit.
1,THE DVD WOULD NOT PLAY,THE DVD WOULD NOT PLAY. I CHECKED OTHER DVDS AND THEY ALL PLAYED BUT NOT THIS ONE. ALAS AND ALACK
3,A very busy book,"This book tends to jump around alot. It goes from past to present and inbetween. I can say that the author put a lot of research into this one. The history of it is interesting, although not a ""factual"" book, anyone who has any knowledge of Darwin will know that some of the information in the book is true. All that said, it is a good book for maybe the younger man. Not so much for the over fourty woman such as myself."
2,"Great build up, but the book failed to deliver.","This book could have been so much better. I was so excited while about 200 pages in, and then it crashed and burned. Some story lines were lost on me all together."
3,A new spin on Darwin's story.,"John Darnton has crafted an interpretation of Darwin's story that is interesting and enjoyable to read. The story weaves three separate storylines throughout the book. Initially, I thought that this would be hard to control and keep the readers interests. I was surprised that concern did not occur.The three storylines involved Darwin's voyage on the Beagle, Elizabeth Darwin and her relationship with her father, and finally two modern day researchers investigating Darwin. The first two storylines were based on historical figures and more enjoyable. The modern day story was a little too farfetched, but I could overlook that.This story does not have a life and death race to solve a mystery, which I found to be good. Not every historical fiction should hinge on a mystery that people are willing to kill to keep secret."
2,Hey... Let's publish another DaVinci Code!,"If you look at the titles of these two books, ""The DaVinci Code"" and ""The Darwin Conspiracy,"" the similarity seems obvious. And the approach to storytelling is similar too. The problem with this endeavor is that the secrets being unmasked are not nearly as startling or interesting... or even believable. I much preferred Darnton's ""Neanderthal."""
2,The Darwin Conspiracy by John Darnton,"I first read about Darwin in Harry Thompson's ""This Thing of Darkness"", also released as "" To the Edge of the World"". This treatment of essentially the same subject was brilliant compared with Darnton's effort. In fact I am certain that if Darnton had first read Thompson's novel, he wouldn't have bothered to write this insipid and implausible book.If you are like me, you also quickly lose confidence in an author when he doesn't get the historical facts right. In one scene during the voyage of the ""Beagle"", Darnton has a character say"" ...the Wedgewoods, to whom he is related both directly and through his wife..."" The Beagle left England December 27th, 1831 and returned five years later. Darwin married in 1839.Busted Mr. Darnton!Don't bother with this book- read Thompson's much better treatment of the subject."
3,Ok but no page turner..,"Like some other reviewers here, I found this book ok,not much happens and there is no real mystery or suspense invovled.The characters are bland and not believable at all,most of the history is wrong and the plot is boring.But I finished it just the same, I needed to kill some time on my train form Rome to Florence and back again.The book is ok but is no page turner."
3,Dashed hopes,"Since a review needn't give a synopsis of the book - and that has been well covered by others - let me say only thatthis was an interesting read until the last couple of chapters. I can deal with implausible coincidences, that is what novels are often made of - but the ending to this book ignores basic precepts in the anthropolgy of religions in an attempt to make the author's point. I was very disappointed just because I had been enjoying it very much until then - altho the modern sub-plot with the protagonist and his brother was superficial and hinged on implausible events. (without going deeply into it, heavy duty, expensive research on deadly communicable diseases doesn't take place in old brick buildings for all the obvious reasons.)"
2,"Same lyrics, different tune","How do you review a book when the major problem you had with it was its ""surprise"" conclusion? Without specifics for certain. Let's just say that if you can't get enough of Political Correctness, you'll like this book. As for me, I'm sick of the predictible moralistic self-loathing that takes the best of premises (like this book) and dashes it into a regurgitation of the same old anti-European, anti-Victorian, anti-white propaganda. I'm a fool to have expected something more...something less predictible.Again I cannot really explain, in detail, my disappointment without giving the ending away...suffice it to say if you liked this you'll probably enjoy anything written by Martin Bernal and his ilk."
2,Plays fast and loose with history and yet purports to be based on fact,"I just finished this book and have to say I found it quite disappointing. I expected a fun story about scholars on the trail of a historical mystery--a la A.S. Byatt or something like that--but unfortunately the gross distortion of the history of the Beagle voyage, of Darwin's life, of Wallace's life, and many other details really ruined it for me. I don't mind a little literary license, but painting Darwin as a thief, murderer, and fraud goes way beyond mere embellishment for the sake of the plot. Another reviewer recommended Harry Thompson's To the Edge of the World, and I heartily second that recommendation. Thompson's book is a great read and is written with enough literary embellishment to bring the story to life, but not so much as to grossly distort it. I don't know why Darnton has such an axe to grind, but it doesn't make for a great novel."
2,Where Darwin Got the Idea for Natural Selection,"This is a historical novel with a twist of alternative history. When two scientists locked in a rivalry over Charles Darwin come across some papers of Darwin's daughter's, they are forced to regard their hero in a different light. Apparently Darwin was also locked in a bitter scientific rivalry when he went on the voyage of the Beagle -- and his nemesis never returned from that fateful voyage.The conspiracy referred to in the title has nothing to do with the efficacy of natural selection, but why would Darwin not want to say where he got the idea in the first place. If I say anymore I'll ruin the plot.The book contains marvelous period details and research give this exciting thriller an enjoyable edge."
1,Color NOT orange!!!,"Bought this item thinking it was orange, so I bought seat covers to match. When I recieved my order, I opened the box immediately only to find out that the steering cover was dark red, NOT ORANGE!!!! Very dissapointed!"
2,The Decline of Nancy Drew,"Although the revised editions of the Nancy Drew books never lived up to the originals in my opinion, the writing was always decent...But then around volumes #27-#30, it really started to decline,and became what I call poor quality. It seemed as if the writer('s) really did'nt care what thier readers would think of thier work, just as long a they got thier pay check, they were happy. And the art is atroucious! The cover paintings arent too bad, but its the illustrations inside the books that really show the lazziness of the artist. I really liked the original illustrater's (which was Russel Tandy) approach. He would first actually read the whole book before going to work, unlike Nappi who would doodle a few pencil drawings that looked as if they came from a generic color book from Big Lots... I dispies this garbage..."
3,a good imitation,"I know this is only an imitation, like one of those hundreds of Alien imitations but like the Stones say it is only science fiction, but i like it.It looks like a made-for-TV movie and would have been a great film if the budget was a little more generous. THE surprises are, luke perry and tom berenger are the worst actors in the movie and the crew is very convincing"
4,This Was A Christmas Gift For My Brother,"My brother watched this, and told me that it was good. I'm going to have to ask him to bring it, so we can all watch it. I'm glad he liked it as it was a Christmas gift."
1,horrible acting and scene development,Between the terrible acting and the scene development for the so-called actors ... it was a disaster of a movie - and not just regarding the plot.
5,silent venom,"this movie is good it hasgore,creature violence,guns.and the most important thinga good ending.so do only goodreviews please."
4,The Perfect Bar,"These bars are the best! Hard to find. I always keep one in my glove compartment for emergenices. Great breakfast on the run with a cup of coffee. The only place I can find them inquanity is at Wal-Mart. So if I go to Wal-Mart I end up picking up 59 other items that I really don't need. This way I am saving money and thegas money to travel 45 minutes. In the Weight Watcher world they arefour points, well worth it for a meal. I really don't find the other""flavors"" as satisfying. I think the chocolate layer if the icing on thecake! Enjoy! I have lost almost 50 lbs. and include the bars several times aweek into my diet plan."
5,South Beach Foods,"I have been watching what I eat all my life, and until now and South Beach foods, DIETING has never been fun, or lasted very long. Their foods make is so much better......THANKS so much South Beach..."
3,Soft Psychedelia-Fantasy - A Sword Named Revenge,"Lots of Elizabethan type mis-identities and masks being revealed. People misunderstanding who loves who. People dying and reviving. It has a bizarre, ambling soft psychedelia - implied magic, fantasy hinted at and primitive wire-work that is pleasant in it's creakiness. Watching this was easy, actually. Plot makes little sense (""Thought-dead Kung Fu baddie teams up with woman drug practitioner to take control of Kung-Fu masters."") but who cares? The dubbing was actually pretty decent, the mix fairly well modulated except for a couple of really horribly voiced heroes. In the end it all works out and our lovers find one another for the final fade out. I can't fully explain why I sometimes uncritically like this stuff. Maybe it's simply because it isn't glossy or overproduced (and certainly the arbitrary plot keeps throwing twists and turns at the viewer.) Maybe it's simply because Keano Reeves is not in it (sorry, very cheap gag - I like ""Point Break."")"
5,Ilumina Gold product reveiw,I have been VERY impressed with this software. I is very complete and very easy to use. My wife and kids love it. It was also very easy to load.
5,Amazing Bible Software,This is by far teh best bible software available! With lots of multimedia features and study topics... Buy it! You wont regret it!
4,great condition,this book was in great condition and i recieved it in excellent time. thank you guys.
5,This book was required reading for my Yoga teacher training.,"I can see why my yoga teacher trainer pick out this book to be required reading. It is very well assembled with great picture of well respected Yogi's. The form of the positions leave nothing to be desired. The descriptions of the positions and the subtleties of what the pose requires was well written. It isn't unusual for me to use the same phrasing as they do in the book because some cues can't be better said. Perhaps I'll out grow this book, but as a beginning teacher, I learned a lot from it. I love the amount of detail that the book gives because there is always more that you can accomplish in any Yoga pose, and you must work at the level of the students you're teaching and remind them of things that may be automatic for you."
3,"Good for the beginner, not useful for me",This was a required text for a yoga teacher training I took. I found it an nice introduction but compared to Iyengars light on yoga it is a brief overview. I'm going to give it to my Mom who has a bit of a yoga practice. It will be perfect for her.
5,Super book on yoga,"This is the book that my yoga instructor refers to as her favorite. I looked through it and decided that if I were to buy one yoga book, this would be it. The steps are detailed and the pictures are wonderful. I'm very happy with it."
5,Best book on Yoga....,"Being from the part of the world thats the birth place of yoga, my love for the art is hereditry but this is the easiest, most do-able book I have ever come across whether you are a beginner or a teacher.I dont like reading 5 pages on the techniques and the core of a certain pose but I dont like just pictures either. This is a very balanced book..Highly recommended."
5,You can tell the difference!!,"I love Kewpie Mayonnaise!!!It just tastes much better than other brands!One of the secrets for the rich taste comes from how they use eggs.Kewpie only uses the yellow (this concentrates the taste of eggs)while American brands like Kraft use both the yellow and white (this weakens the taste of eggs).If you try Kewpie and compare it with other brands,you can tell the difference between Kewpie and other brands.You will realize that you can actually identify the taste of eggs with Kewpie.This is by far the best mayonnaise in the world!!"
5,Yummie!,"This mayo is tops! Just right on many traditional Japanese dishes such as Takoyaki or Okonomiyaki...also perfect on pizza, burgers, even steamed veggies! I bought mine at the asianfoodgrocer site for around $7 including shipping; my Takoyaki never had it so good!"
3,I Expected Better,"By all these positive reviews I was expecting some magical mayonnaise taste but in reality it just tastes like mayonnaise.It does have MSG in it, I didn't care, I'm not allergic to it so it doesn't matter.I'll stick to Hellmanns real."
2,Not really mayo,"If you like real mayonnaise, you're not going to like this. This is more of a flavored oil ""mayo"". Might as well get Miracle Whip.Really, it's a different taste and texture, it's just not Mayonnaise.So like the other reviewers, if you hate real mayo, try this or Miracle Whip."
1,The vendor gets zero stars,"Don't believe what this page says about the shipping on this item. Target does not ship within 3 to 5 days after you authorize the purchase, or 3 to 5 days after you get the email confirmation of the order, or 3 to 5 days after your card company approves the purchase. No, they don't ship until 4 weeks after the card company approves the purchase -- if then. And when you ask questions, like whether the product is still in production, you get back corporate gobbledygook. You've been warned."
4,Just thought I'd try it,"Got this on whim as I am pre-planning a sci fi campaign( first ever) and am quite pleased...ran a short scenario at recent gaming session and was successful...lots o rules ,but easily adaptable and core mechanic is easy to use on the fly....can see similarities with old TSR games ,but some of the more modern game mechanics look to have been explored by the old game company back then...kuddos and I highly recommend this product."
5,Great entry level HDTV,This is an excellant TV that provides 16:9 widescreen High definition programming. Overall it has the best picture quality and stylish looks for the money when compared to sony. DVDs in anamorphic widescreen format look great when connected to the component inputs.
3,The Complete Word Study Dictionary,"This is a very good OT study resource. Both definitions and explanations of words are provided. The link to Strong's numbers make it easy to find words. The only negative was not related to the book, but to how the book was shipped. I ordered three large books. There was no packing to hold the books secure and they were tossed about during shipping. About 1/4"" of the pages of this book were badly bent. I will not order any large Bible related books from Amazon in the future."
5,Great product!,Wonderful resource for inductive Bible study! I use this when taking a Kay Arthur Precept class and it brings the words to life!
4,Kenny Rogers: Lengend of the Gambler,Really enjoyed the humour and easy banter between Billy Montana and Brady Hawkes.Of course good triumphed over evil. Well acted.
5,glad I bought,love these movies it came on time and it was just what i wanted. I spend all weekend watching them
5,Best Sound Card of Its Day,"This was far and away the best sound card of its day. Don't let the date on Amazon's page fool you; this card was released in 2000. Unfortunately Philips has long since stopped producing sound cards and has not released updated drivers for some time, so this card is no longer fully compatible with DirectX. It's tragic that Philips didn't continue its sound card line; I can barely imagine what they would have developed. Only recently have the mainstream sound card manufacturers incorporated the features Philips had already developed six years ago, such as digital outputs and software that expands stereo signals into 5.1 surround sound. This card was truly ahead of its time, and at $80 was a steal. Unfortunately, its day seems to have passed. The good news is that there are finally some worthy successors available, so after six years of use, I can finally bid my Philips Acoustic Edge a fond farewell. I can only hope my new sound card will enjoy so long a life."
4,Gift for Grandaughter,I purchased this along with three other DVDs for my grandaughter who has become interested in Shakespeare. She loved them!
1,"Sorry, it's not funny - it kills a very playful script.","As an English teacher who teaches ""Much Ado"" every year, I was thrilled to find an alternative version of this play on DVD (I enjoy the Kenneth Branagh version, but it is not definitive), and the enthusiastic reviews convinced me to purchase it.Unfortunately, while the 1920's concept seems like a good idea and this version includes a greater portion of Shakespeare's original script, this film loses the spirit of the play to wooden acting, heavy-handed directing, and a lack of humor. It may be that this version played well onstage, but it plays very poorly on screen.Quite frankly, this version bores me to tears.I wish I could recommend it. I show parts of it to my 9th graders each spring so that they can see how differently Shakespeare can be interpreted, but they and I both hate this version and yearn to return to Branagh's interpretation.I await a better production to use for comparison with the Branagh version."
3,Newman deserves credit for trying something boldly unusual...,"Newman's fifth film for Martin Ritt, ""The Outrage"" was based on the classic Japanese film ""Rashmon,"" but Ritt transplanted the tale to the South Western U.S. following the Civil War...Carrasco has been convicted of raping a woman (Claire Bloom) and murdering her husband (Laurence Harvey), but four eye-witness accounts conflict... All agree that the bandit raped the woman, but only one asserts that he committed the killing...Sadistic, defiant, and challenging, Carrasco snarls, sneers, and walks with macho arrogance, to hide the fact that he can only be strong by tying a man to a tree and raping his wife...The role allows Newman to give a bravura performance, not unlike Toshiro Mifune's in the Kurosawa film, and the stylization would fit the story if everybody else weren't playing it so straight... As it is, the performance seems too showy, easily understandable, exaggerated..."
2,Weak Imitation of a Masterpiece,"First of all if you haven't seen Akira Kurosawa's ""Rashomon,"" the masterpiece upon which this film was based, go and rent or buy it now. It is simply one of the most fascinating and compelling films ever made. In ""The Outrage"" director Ritt tries to capture the spirit of Kurosawa's film and adapt it for a wider American audience, but fails through mis-casting and a bit too much consious aping of the original film--portions of ""The Outrage"" are almost shot-for-shot copies of the same scenes in ""Rashomon."" For better American adaptations of Kurosawa films see ""The Magnificent Seven"" (""Seven Samurai"") and ""Fistful of Dollars"" (""Yojimbo"" also remade as ""Last Man Standing"")...or better yet seek out the originals."
2,What Happend?,"""The Outrage,"" while not quite an outrage, is, at least, a disappointment. A film with this cast (Paul Newman, Claire Bloom, Edward G. Robinson) and director (Martin Ritt) promises a better result. Much of the fault lies with Ritt. He shot the film with an odd combination of lenses and camera angles that, while adding to the atmosphere, make the flashback sequences appear distant and uninvolving. The question, in the end, is not ""what happened?"" but rather ""who cares?""The film succeeds best in the framing sequences featuring Robinson, in one of his best roles, as the con man who keeps score and philosophizes about human nature. James Wong Howe's exceptional black and white photography deserves special mention, and Newman's over-the-top Mexican bandit almost convinces."
5,The West gaze!,"After the colossal feat of Rashomon in 1950, and its world repercussion around the world, it would said that this film (the glorious masterpiece of Kurosawa to my mind) modified and influenced the new generations to come of filmmakers about this delicate subject. How many victims have been murdered or condemned due the religious, political or moral truth of the historical Age? But worst still: How many more will be dead due the same reason?Martin Ritt dared and won with this discrete but potent portrait about the perpetual elusiveness of the truth and its always changing nature according the beholder, not only under the actual circumstances, but through the years, because most of us tend to make our minds and alter our own perspective decade after decade. So when you talk about the truth, it would be convenient to make clear and underline: my truth instead of the truth."
5,I am THRILLED with this opera---and with it's cast!,I am so glad to have discovered this opera. What a magnificent cast! Vivica Genaux [Arminio] and Geraldine McGreevy [Tusnelda] are a JOY to behold and hear!
5,Good Book,"For someone new in the trading systems industry, this is a good book and worth reading.Linetrol Development"
1,Calculus 101,I bought this book after seeing it recommended by supposedly knowledgeable people. The author seems to be promoting tradestation because he describes how to code some of the information on tradestation.This is useless to me. You have to have a calculus degree to have any chance of understanding his systems. He doesn't ever fully explain any one of the systems. I looked and looked and couldn't find it anywhere.It seemed to me that he gathered a bunch of data and threw it into a bookwithout a clue as to what it was. An absolute waste of money. I have purchased many books on trading and always found something useful in them. I found nothing here.
1,Worst book ever,"I really disliked this book! I have read dozens of books on technical analysis, and in my opinion this is among the worst. I say this for 2 major reasons. First, there are hundreds of typos in this book, some of which are major. With typos in many of the formulas, it can be nearly impossible to follow the math in the book. Second, most topics are only given a cursory overview in this book. One would think, given the size of the book and the number of mathematical formulas, that the book was a thorough resource, but it is not. It is overly repetitive (adding pages without value), and most of the math is simply there for show (and not well explained)."
3,Might interest a mathematician,"I've only gotten about a third to halfway thru the book as I can't see what the author's purpose is, whether laboring thru the rest would benefit me or not. It reads like a college level textbook of the mathematics behind technical analysis. Boring. In what I read, the author worked thru proof formulas to get to more elaborate indicators. In so doing, sometimes he explained what his formula's symbols meant and sometimes not. I sure don't want to go back thru the book to see if I can find an earlier description of what the symbols mean should I ever want to use one of the new formulas. Then he compared some of the new trend followers like standard deviation against olders ones like moving average and point and figure and behold none are really better than the others. When I get stranded on a tropical isle and am bored to tears, I will page thru the rest of it."
1,A NONTRADER'S BOOK ABOUT A LOT WITHOUT DETAILES,"Another book by someone not trading, but having a name as books writer. Good research work. If you are interested in research, not trading, probably this huge book will help you.One star as practical value for trading.If you are a beginer trader or a trader looking to improve your results, it would probably make sense to look for books written by good traders or former traders - real and practical value, incorporating some of their profitable trading experience. And not over a thousand pages!Example: JOHN CARTER - Mastering the Trade, JOHN PERSON - A Compleate Guide to Technical Trading Tactics, STEPHEN BIGALOW - High Profit Candlestick Patterns."
5,Great Vintage Look,"I wanted a faucet that looked vintage, but not too kitchy, and this is perfect. The quality of the faucet is amazing, I know that it will last a very long time."
3,A Lie if you think it plays JPEGs,"BEWARE of the fine print! I was so thrilled when I first read it can play jpgs. I thought this can replace a laptop when I am traveling. When I got it, the fine print says it plays jpgs on a SD memory card. Now, who is going to go out a buy a SD memory card and the transfer their pictures on there? What a big LIE! With a laptop, all I have to do is burn all my pictures on a cd and take it with my other cds. Now I have to pay extra money to buy SD memory card, a reader, and the works. This little memory card cannot have all the memory (~128mB) of your cd (700mB). In addition, all my investment in Compact Flash cards are worthless now.I ask myself now why I didn't pay the extra money for a [$$$] low end laptop that can play dvds. I don't know. I guess I was taken by the corporate tagline. Sorry for any spelling errors but as you can see, I am visably upset."
5,Illustrations by Garth Williams are timeless....,"When I was a child, my mother used to read me all kinds of books (1940s), but the books with illustrations by Garth Williams held a particular fascination for me. My mom taught kindergarten for 42 years. Now that I am 64, I find looking thru these old books give me great pleasure. His ""Wait Until The Moon Is Full"" book is my favorite--I have a little family of raccoons that visit me every night (this year mom had triplets....) and they are so similar to the book's renderings I laugh at the idea that my early dreams of ever seeing a real raccoon have come true. I never had children, so rediscovering Garth William's illustrations and the wonderful stories told by them after a 50-60 year absence gives me great joy, and I am happy to see they are continuing to be republished over and over."
4,Night time reading,"My brothers, parents and I fondly remember reading this book to my little sister. The repetitive 7 little rabbits becomes so monotonous that the reader is usually asleep, while the child is still enraptured. Oh, and don't even try to skip a rabbit."
2,annoyingly repetitive,"This book is so repetitive, so repetitive, that I want to take it outside and drop it down in the ground in a hole, built by a mole, down in the ground, down in the ground and never see it again. Then! Shh, don't say peep, my toddler's asleep and I hope he doesn't notice it's gone. Cause he kind of likes it."
2,"Not her worst, but far not her best","I like:Hi! Hi! Hi! 1986 (maxi version 06:13 - available on 12"")Innocent Love 1986 (maxi version 06:46 - available on 12"")In common, you'd better buy her previous (""The Long Play"" 1985) or her next (""10 on 1"" 1987) album."
3,Yeah... OK...,"This book is OKAY. Not great. I'm not so sure I would recommend it to anyone.The problem is it has very little information about most climbing areas and omits many great areas and routes entirely. There's TONS of climbing on the Rims in Billings but this book makes no mention of any of it. Or how about all the great climbing in the Beartooth mountains? Not mentioned. Bouldering? None. All the awesome new climbing in the Townsend/Helena area? Not mentioned. I guess this book is just outdated.Most people know about Rockclimbing.com Just go there and find information about routes in an area your visiting, if you want more detailed and specific information then most climbing areas in montana have dedicated climbing guide books for those areas. So if you're going to be climbing in a particular area frequently, get a guide book for that specific area."
4,World History,"When purchasing individual books for homeschooling it is essential to know the year, so that the buyer will have the right student, teacher, and test/quiz books that go together. The ones I received are current. Thank you"
4,Love it!,"I love this book, and my students do too. The songs are ""follow the directions"" songs. There are a lot of fundamentals that you can teach using these songs/activities, as well as using them as an incentive, since they enjoy it so much! I use it with KDG and 1st grade."
2,Preacher,"Got this for my husband for his birthday and we where both very disappointed in the movie. I don't know if it was the scrip, the director, or actor but I am sorry I got this for him."
2,very bad language,My husband started to watch this but didn't finish. He said it was full of very bad language. We don't like movies that have that in them.
2,not that good,"I couldn't get drawn in. Bad acting, very predictable and corny. A lot of unnecessary plot.. way too long. I feel like they did try and make a good movie, thus 2 stars instead of 1."
2,Machine Gun Preacher - didn't fulfill,"With a name like this and after watching some trailers, we tried this movie. Now, I like movies with happy endings and this flick didn't even win there. Slow at times and a frustrated end."
2,More machine guns less preaching please,I really wanted to fall asleep about half way through. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I can't even think of anything else to say to cover the minimum 20 work review. It really stinks that repeated words don't count.
2,Really?,"Another video I watched to the end only because I paid for it. Was this released straight to video? I really hope so, because I would not waste $10 to see it in a theater."
2,What can the Lord make by them?,"This is a ridiculous movie. The only positive fact is to show the terribles problems in that country. The rest is just evocate a ""god"" that does not exists and convinces people to pray and go to church. Thanks ""lord""! ""aleluia""! What is this??What can a construction of a church helps??? Money to the wronh pockets!Thanks ""god"" the movie is over! And the Blu-ray here in Brasil is 1.85:1 and the video quality is BAD! What a shame!"
4,Machine Gun Preacher,This film depicts how easy it is to become deeply involved in something that you really feel passionate about. Excellent performance by Gerard Butler
5,Why didn't this movie get a broader release?,I'm giving 5 stars to the trailer. The trailer advertised limited release. All the money spent to produce this film and then limited release? I live in the country in Texas. I will have to wait and buy the movie to see it. I read the book the movie was based on and then bought more books to share with friends.I saw a review that said the movie under performed. Of course it would under perform on limited release! Then we're stuck with the garbage Hollywood puts out the rest of the year. Maybe it's just because the word Preacher is in the title.Frustrated with Hollywood!
3,"Very crude, but thought provoking.","My wife and I were intrigued by the title and description of Machine Gun Preacher and decided to rent it one afternoon while the kids were in school. We don't care for profanity in movies and this had a lot of it. That (for us) is hard to get past. The profanity is pervasive and very intense in many scenes. If such things don't bother you, you may enjoy this film more than we did. It really helps to open your eyes to things going on in the world that we would all rather forget. It is worth seeing for that alone. It is not a feel good movie about a biker gangster coming to Jesus and then changing the world. It's a lot more complicated and leaves you unsure in the end what good is being done and for what reasons...just like real life."
5,Loved it,Excellent movie and it shows that once you open the door to the Lord Almighty he'll guide you down the path of righteousness
3,Not safe for the entire famliy,"I was expecting a good Christian story, but what I got was a hollywood version. It was a decent movie, but definately not safe for the entire family."
5,Great Movie,"Lots of action, very interesting, AND I watched it twice, so it was definitely a great movie. A must see."
4,I liked it.,"I liked it overall. It's based on a true story, and I felt it was worth the $3.99 cost to rent online."
5,great purchase,I love this movie. It was so inspirational and encouraging as you watched the main character struggle to do something good for people.
4,Unusual,"This movie depicts what is going on in the world today. Gerard Butler was a surprise in this movie. He showed a soft side and a tough side, which he had to do get his mission done."
5,Intense,"What's not to love it has Gerard Butler in it!!! This is a very intense role for him. Gut wrenching to say the least. He's good at what he does! It's not a movie you will want to watch everyday (as some of his romantic comedies), but it is a good movie! It's just hard to watch so much blood, guts and bombing when children are involved."
4,machine gun preacher,"Based on a true life story. Gerard Butler once again excelled in his role as the machine gun preacher. Touching Dramatic, suspenseful, action movie. Two Thumbs Up!!!"
5,this is what its all about!!!,"this movie is such an inspiration to see. it goes to show u that god can use anyone to do his work and show his love. im so glad that this story was told and showed to the world, especially since its based on a true story. evryone should experience this great film."
5,Excellent movie,"I had hoped to see this in theaters in my area but it never was released here. Not for kids, this movie keeps it real when it comes to the life of a biker and drug addict who came to Christ for help.I know it doesn't follow Sam Childers life exactly, but he is ok with it and so am I. Please share this movies links on socail media and via word of mouth. Don't let hollywood censor it, like they did with the limited release in theaters. More people need to see this."
4,Gerard Butler can Do No Wrong,"It doesn't seem to matter to me what role he takes, I simply love watching Gerard Butler strut his stuff on the screen."
5,Machine Gun Preacher,very inspirational movie about how you can do a difference in life. not for the faint of heart very graphic very sad moments in the movie but all inspirational and makes you want to go out and save more orphan kids.
5,Worth owning,"This is not a candy coated story about a preacher. In fact, he tells more about his past than you may want to know. What is important is the work he continues to do in the Sudan to save as many children as possible. With his own funds, he built orphanages and met the needs of children, including protecting them from those who would make slaves of them. His mission is in a war zone. Who knows what we might do in his place? Most of us will never know. Few Americans bother to donate to such causes, much less put their lives and incomes on the line to help victims in another country. Sam Childers is an unusual person. God showed him a need and to this day helps him meet it. An amazing story of how God can use anyone."
3,machine gun preacher,"A good 8-8.5, it is a touching, heart breaking and gripping movie. Keep in mind you will want to see more violence at some key pointsof the story towards the child enslaving adult bad guys and not just for story pace but revenge you the viewer will want for theprotagonist and his children. The whole movie is about this one man and his lopsided dedication to these children and for that theother characters suffer development but the point is well made with decent acting from everybody."
4,MY GRADE: B to B plus.,"This tale focuses on a Sam Childers, a redneck (played by Gerard Butler) who does horrible things, finds redemption through God and then chooses to seek redemption by helping the children in a section of war torn Africa. It isn't as easy as it looks and there are a number of setbacks, as well as a sometimes non-supportive family back home.It's actually based on a true story which made it even more interesting a la ""Another Man's War"".The budget was $30M and it made a bit over $2.8M at the Box Office.CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; FOCUSES: B; WHEN WATCHED: mid October 2012 (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus"
3,Worth a watch,"It was okay. It was good for giving a glimpse of what goes on there and bringing awareness. It didn't quite feel real though and I never really got emotionally into, even though it was based on a real story and there were some graphic violent scenes that should have made me feel something...I don't think the acting or dialogue was that believable. One example, the guy gets out of prison and his wife comes to get him and they make a point of showing how she doesn't smoke, drink, strip, etc. anymore...then cut to scene of her riding him in a car on a street with others passing by. They seemed really bent on making sure we saw her in that light while at the same time playing up how she's found God and church and it was cheesy. For me, it was one of those movies where you are aware in each scene of the actors instead of losing yourself in the story.Overall it was worth the watch, but there was something missing that would connect me to the story being told."
5,Amazing Action/Drama with Great Character Development,"My husband and I really enjoyed this true story about a man who changed his life and then seriously began to consider whether he was doing all he could to help in this world. This newfound conviction led him to help orphans of the civil war in Sudan. After watching this, my husband and I have given much more thought about what we can do to help others as well. It's an excellent movie with quality writing, directing, and acting, as well as wonderful cinematography. I would highly recommend it to any adult. This movie is gritty and realistic, however, with coarse language and graphic scenes of violence, so I would advise parents to use discretion in allowing children to watch it. Personally, I don't think I'd let anyone under twelve view this film."
5,aBSOLUTELY GREAT MOVIE,"Rent it, you won't be sorry, action packed, and best of all it's within the doctrine of being believable too."
3,decent movie,"Wife and I enjoyed it. True story and some pretty rough imagery of what is going on in North Uganda and southern Sudan. Pretty inspirational and at least made me reevaluate priorities in my life. Sam Childers is a true blessing to those kids. Acting was okay, the accents were off. The people in the church sounded more like southerners than people from Pennsylvania. Other than that, a good movie that brings to light the work of a man who saw a need to help the kidnapped kids."
4,RELEASE Machine Gun Preacher!!!,"I want to know what the deal is with the distribution of this movie??? It got VERY limited release and now the DVD release date keeps getting pushed back!What is Hollywood trying to hide on this movie? With Joseph Kony as a key component in the movie and in the news everywhere with KONY 2012, why are they delaying it???I am not a conspiracy theory guy, in fact most I laugh them off, but I really question if the Christian element is just too strong for secular Hollywood??It's a great film, based on a true story (I've seen the movie and read the book), it needs to be seen!"
1,dumb and dumber,"No worth the time, money, or effort. Don't waste your money. Even my dog disliked it, good thing he could not heist his leg that high."
2,"Machine Gun Preacher, oxymoron!","Terrible movie, the guy had good intentions but killing people for God? I guess if he tells you to. I'm not the judge."
3,Great movie?,"I hear this is a great movie. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I wasn't able to watch it in the two days I I rented it.."
3,Machine gun preacher,Interesting movie but the first part is very crude. I guess I'm not used to watching R rated movies. Sad the government of Africa cares less about their children
3,It was okay.,It was an interesting movie but I did not like the movie because it was a bit too real and too bloody.
3,Story is great,"The story is great one and true, acting was a little bland may have been done intentionaly. Good Moral movie.......with a vigilante-soldier preacher....hmmmmmmmm."
5,Gerard Butler is great!,Very good movie! The fact that its based on a true story makes it even more impressive and dramatic. A true story of redemption and making a difference.
4,This movie really makes you think...,"I ordered Machine Gun Preacher because of a little flyer advertising it that came in the case of the movie ""Act of Valor"". I loved Act of Valor. Normally I don't watch rated R movies. However some movies that are rated R, seem more like PG13, such as Act of Valor. Machine Gun Preacher definitely earns an ""R"" rating, mainly for the first part that shows how Sam Childers was before he found Jesus, then for the atrocities in Sudan. The movie is well done, in my humble opinion, and really should make you think."
5,A Book I'll Remember.,"In Going Home, Samuel Alesich intertwines two complex themes: family violence and the developing love between a bi-racial couple. The first is familiar, the second is rarely explored from the inside. Mr. Alesich intertwines the themes with a strong emphasis on spirituality and vivid descriptions of land and sea. I can only conclude that he is intimately familiar with both. The book is rich in tenderness and compassion. And, I found it a pleasure as well as a relief, to read a story in which the lead characters retain their morality and a touching innocence, even though the circumstances surrounding them are harsh. Going Home is a breath of fresh air in what seems to be a never-ending stream of books that feature heros and heroines who are less than honorable and without the ability to share a deep love. My thanks to Mr. Alesich for Going Home."
2,Very dissappointing,I might have liked this book if I was 12. I read it in an hour and felt it a waste of my time. I do not recommend this book.
5,What a superb CD!!,"WOW,I bought this CD after I discovered this artist totally by accident (well, I usually do not listen to the vocal selections on the sampler CD from the British magazine ""The Gramophone""). I guess that it was either fate or luck that made me listen to her selection of Wagner Lieder.As I have always been a fan of alto/contralto's, I find Stephanie Blythe's voice to be smooth, creamy, solid, and very thrilling!!! I really like all of the Handel arias (which are top notch!!), and I will spend more time with the Bach.This Virgin Classics CD is up to Virgin's usual high standard of recording, though I do wish that her voice was more centered between the right and left channels. Then again, my new system still needs some dialing in in my room.I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes vocal music, opera, and best of all, for people who simply like stellar singing!!!Well worth the 5 stars!!!"
3,A little on the self-indulgent side,"Generally the Fabriclive series is pretty solid, and the Format cuts I've heard I have enjoyed, so I got this.The first few cuts are good. I really like 3ft. deep. But after that it kinda falls into a pattern of one self indulgent jam track after the next.I had a hard time listening to the whole thing."
5,I only have the LP,"I purchased the LP back in 1985 and fell in love with these concertos. C.P.E. Bach's style isn't for everyone. However, I've always found his music original and very entertaining. So different from the curtsey stuff you hear from composers from the ""stil galant"", Bach really does his own thing. These particular concertos are alot of fun. Composed during Bach's mature period in Hamburg, there is alot of interesting theme development and crazy little runs that Emmmanuel loved to compose. I haven't seen any of these concertos on other releases so this might be a rare opportunity to possess these wonderful concertos.I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com"
5,Subtle excellence,"Karin Rosenthal manages to bring a given mood to each of her photographs, in addition to the excellent images she portrays. The majority of the photographs in this book bring the viewer into an almost physical contact with the subtle portrails of the human form. This is not a book of abject erotica, but more a celebration of the different parts of the human form."
4,Super Steal!,"I was researching these speakers (and comparable ones) for a while due to the price. I was about ready to buy them when, the day I was planning to, the price dropped [...] I went to [...] to pick them up, brought them home, and started plugging away. I wasn't expecting much but they sound very good and are a steal [...]. The quality of the sound is excellent, they are not Bose, but what do you expect.One issue is the size of the inputs for the speaker wire. They do include wire for all speakers and the sub woofer (which was a nice surprise), but I doubt you can fit heavy gauged wires into them (like Monster Cables). I assume the quality of the sound can be even better than with the crap wires that are included. They have a lot of power for such small speakers, and the ability for you to rotate the 'face' can come in handy. Overall super steal!"
4,HE ENDED LIKE MARVIN GAYE,"One of the most popular singers in BELLE ÉPOQUE era,FRAGSON actually became popular in FRANCE and in ENGLAND singing in both languages,a rare feat at the time.This was a time when the voice of the singers were recorded without the microphone.Those recordings are of particular interest,if you have a passion for that era.That kind of singing of course became old hat after world war 1 ,when new stars like MAURICE CHEVALIER and MISTINGUETT emerged.Along with his contempories POLIN,DRANEM and MAYOL,FRAGSON came to symbolize his time very well.Like MARVIN GAYE,FRAGSON'S life ended tragically at age 44, when his father shot him because he thought his son wanted to send him to an old age house.The last songs in the collection are in ENGLISH.For today's crowd,they sound perhaps unintentionnaly funny.It is interesting to note that many of FRAGSON'S songs are ironic and mysogyne(excuse my french).L'AMOUR BOITEUX,JE CONNAIS UNE BLONDE and SI TU VEUX MARGUERITE were big hits."
4,"Great seller, but product didn't work out for me.","I ended up returning this item b/c I didn't like the unfinished look on the back. It was well made, but I was concerned it would take the paint off of my wall. I contacted the seller via email and he was very nice about me returning the item and the refund was expedient. Will do business with Modern Artisans again."
2,Gold River Canyon: A very good read.,This is a classic western tale told in the style of Louis L'Amour with strong characters in action-packed scenes. Kostro has a thorough background in Arizona and Native American history -- especially his characterization of the Apache. The setting is well done as is the story.
3,Star Wars-B Wing,I purchased this kit to make it for friend of mine. I removed the gold plating and the detailing underneath was excellent. Unfortunately most of it was covered by the plating. The kit was very easy to assemble. If you are a Star Wars fan and want a B wing for your collection this is the only one I found available.
2,Not what I expected,"There is nothing ""very good"" about this used pamphlet. There is writing on the cover, all but 2 of the pages are completely loose, the binding is held together with scotch tape, all the pages and covers are dirty, I can't read parts of the first page because something has been peeled off - although that was mentioned it is worse than I expected, lots of marks and pencil marks inside. How is this ""very good""? I have this exact pamphlet and even though it is almost 100 years old, mine looks so much better. I was hoping to pass this along as a gift, but it is dirty and depressing to look at and not gift-worthy. Sorry I bought it."
3,Looks and feels cheap,"Gets the job done I suppose. For my cheap apartment it blends in perfectly, but if you're outfitting a more upscale place, you should know this curtain is thin and both looks and feels cheap. Not luxurious at all."
2,It is not good,"This item is not really a curtain. It is just a piece of cloth. It is not as same as the picture. I don't know why. I used it as a cover for something in my apartment, but it is not a curtain at all! Don't loose your money!"
2,Cheap,"I won't give this extra stars because of the shipping speed or ease of returning what I concerned to be in inadequate product. Amazon is always great about those two things, so I don't want to artificially inflate the rating because this product is awful. I give it one star for the fact it does black out the light, and another for the color being as I expected. Otherwise, it falls short on all accounts. It is terribly cheap, worse than at a Red Roof Inn or Motel 6. It smells like plastic. The wrinkles would not shake out and you cannot iron them on a hot enough setting to remove the wrinkles. You cannot tell from the photos that the entire back side which faces your window is white plastic. There are other blackout curtains on Amazon that do not have this but block out as much light. We finally found them, and they are not much more expensive. But they are 100% better looking and feeling."
5,Hanky hat,This was truly a hat to give as a treasure. It had one of the lost arts of tatting on each side. Delightful keepsake for my gift.
5,Hotter Wheels You Cannot Buy,"Kids will love this one, but so will the adults! We will remember, at least most men and some women, how we used to beat up the tracks with our Hot Wheels and Barbie Hot Wheels sets. Well this one takes you to the test of your ability to be able to not only zoom the car through a flat track, but allows you full control of the chosen car. Competition is available in the two person mode, and for once, I can even understand the controls as an adult! Find the Mystry Cars and hidden tracks...great Christmas purchase for children of ALL ages!"
3,"Great 1 Player Mode, Bad 2 Player Mode","This game has Great Graphics, nice gameplay. ok car selection and good track selection.this game should of never been made in to a two player mode selection, it just isn't fun and should be avoided.when you just Ride alone, then its a very good game.All in all this game is a let down, you expect so much more and they don't even give you 50%!"
2,good for a headache,"I bought this game after trying it in the stores first. I liked it in the stores, but when I bought it, I was completely disappointed. I beat the game quickly, in one night, and it gave me a head ache. It is also a little frustrating because some stuff just happens. If you are buying it to play with the whole family, then I guess I could recomend it, but for anyone who plays games a lot, I suggest looking around for a better game."
3,ehh,"cd case was cracked. it is a gift for someone else, so i havent messed around with it, but i assume it plays in cd player fine. although, i did recieve it promptly."
1,Good luck!,"This was a great TV for the first six days I owned it. Then, on the seventh day, it rested...or rather, it died, apparently from a rather serious power supply problem. My dealer (not Amazon) tossed this hot potato into Panasonic's lap, and dealing with a manufacturer like that can sometimes be like trying to flatten the Rocky Mountains with a tablespoon. I am proud to say I now own the world's most expensive paperweight, as I watch my nine year old, twenty seven inch JVC, and the Panasonic takes up space on the spare bedroom floor, gathering dust, and waiting for a resolution which may or may never come. No matter how good the performance of this unit may be (when it works) remember, customer service is far more important."
2,Power Problems here too!,"Hmm...seems Panasonic has a problem that needs to be addressed. My 3-yr-old set would not power up, we would unplug the set then plug it back in and it would be fine. A couple of days ago it decided not to power on at all. When the set is turned on, it trys to power up and then just turns off. I have always been a Panasonic fan and have enjoyed the set, but I have to admit I'm rethinking my loyalty. My 12-yr-old Toshiba hasn't missed a beat. Anybody had any success in getting a response from Panasonic?"
1,Seems like a power problem,"I bought this TV 3 years ago. Picture quality/sound/clarity is great. Once in a while I couldn't turn it on. But then I would unplug, replug and it would work fine. And suddenly today, the damn set doesn't stay on. If I unplug and replug, the power (light ) briefly comes on and then goes off. This seems to be a systemic problem with this model, since I see several customers have complained about this issue. If panasonic does not fix this cost effectively, I'll boycott every product of theirs for the rest of my life..."
4,Power outlet adapter,Every other parts look good except for its big size. I had to put a four star eval.
3,Great Book - Funny Smell,I love this book but I bought it used and it had a funny smell to it. It smelled musty like it had been in a flooded out basement.
1,Ripped off,Book arrived and was heavily used and all of the push out shapes were missing!It arrived I was shocked and thru it in the garbage
4,A Great ND Movie!,"In Nancy Drew's Love Match, Nancy Drew and George Fayne catch a famous tennis star (The Brady Bunch's Maureen McCormic) stealing jewelry! Asked by the star's father to go undercover and keep his daughted out of trouble, Nancy and George set out for Las Vegas to catch a cat burlgar and prove the star wrong. It's packed with mystery, action, and suspence! I loved this movie and I highly recomend it to any Nancy Drew fan."
5,Timeless story for all ages,This was one of my favorite books as a child and I read it often now to my own children. Back then I didn't know exactly what it was that I loved about the book. It was kind of sad but happy at the same time. It had cute pictures and was fun to listen to because it all rhymes. That's probably why my kids like it now. I like it now for all of those reasons but also because of the idea behind the story. The idea that freedom is a right and a privilege for all creatures big and small.
4,review A Mouse to be Free,"In my opinion, this was one of the best children's books I ever read, and illustrations were outstanding. I discovered it when my own children were toddlers, gave it to nieces, and now want to give it to my grandson. The package was shipped directly to my son, so I don't know the actual physical condition of the book yet."
4,No surprises,"My 27 yr old daughter was reminiscing about how much she loved this book, particularly the illistrations. I immediately searched Amazon and found several copies. This seller's price was hard to refuse. The book came quickly and was in the described condition. I was very pleased with this seller."
3,"Liked illustrations, not the version of the story","It's a large book, well-made and I liked the illustrations. However, I didn't like the way it is written. Goldilocks is all in the third person. I also didn't like the author's adjectives (example, ""middle sized mother bear's middle sized bowl"") Also, at the end she runs off without a word. No doubt it's a question of preference but there's mine."
3,Not the exhaustive dictiionary I was hoping for,"If you need a pocket dictionary that has basic terms, concepts and philosophers then this is your book. However if you need some more modern terms defined or some meat on the definitions you will find this dictionary lacking. Unfortunatley you dont have much other choices for a portable dictionary as the cambridge is unwieldly. I find it fun to open the book and just begin reading from antwhere but as to its pragmatic value I would say it is limited."
3,Dictionary of Philosophy,A helpful reference book for the beginning philosophy student. It lists philosophical terms in alphabetical order and is easy to use as a dictionary. Great if you are memorizing terms or looking up the names of philosophers and need a quick answer.
3,Where's the entry for Charles Sanders Peirce?,"It is impossible at this point to talk about philosophy without mentioning the extensive (though unpublished until after his death) work of Charles Sanders Peirce. He is mentioned several times in this voluminous text, but there is no formal entry on him, nor is he in the index. A serious deficiency (oversight? or intentional?) of the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, in my opinion. Otherwise the information is adequate, but not worth buying new."
5,It saved my life...,"I was in the midst of writing my midterm when I thought of buying this book. I'm glad I did. I didn't get an 'A', but it did help me seal a 'B'. I'm glad it came in handy, otherwise I would've failed."
3,Give My Regards To Technology Street,"For collectors, the original vinyl of this 1966 release is an absolute diamond, as this rare album still has great demand amongst Beatles/McCartney fans.This reissue has the original soundtrack - which clocked in at nearly 25 minutes - of the George Martin Orchestra/McCartney and the arrangememts/performances from the 1990s by Carl Aubut and Anthony Rozankovic/The Flute Enchantee Quartet.The problem is the music by the George Martin Orchestra/McCartney is not remastered, with this reissue source from vinyl. With the technology available, it essentially could be termed as an authorized bootleg.But this will suffice for those who have waited for years for a CD release, in particular with the additional performances. Though this is a soundtrack that deserves a definitive reissue that does not cut corners."
5,The Family Way Soundtrack by Paul McCartney,I have been looking for this album for the last 22 years. It was one of the last items to make my Beatles collection complete !
4,Track Listing,The track listing for this item is: 1. Journey (Radio Edit) (3:48); 2. Journey (Original) (8:06); 3. Journey (Gentle Instrumental) (10:59); 4. Journey (Aphex Twin Care Mix) (10:12); 5. Journey (Hazchem Remix) (6:51). Rephlex label CAT 040 CD. UPC 5027238004023.
4,Good enough,"I am not sorry I bought this product. The screen is big enough for one person, looks fine and you can play with the aspect ratio, which comes in handy. The audio needs to go through a headset -- the speaker stinks. Downsides: The extra battery costs almost as much as the player and the power cord is bulky and isn't compatible with anything else, I think. We hauled this all over Europe without a problem. There may be better deals out there now, but I am satisfied with this unit."
5,Practial Steps for Planning and Holding Cottage Meetings,"This is an excellent book, setting out how to plan and hold a Cottage Meeting Stewardship Committement program in the local church. Giving practial and detailed guidance on how to set up these small group stewardship meetings in churchmembers homes, this book can open up a whole new way of living out stewardship."
4,Y 2K,"I missed my chance... I should have written a book on the ""coming danger"" of Y 2K LOLOLOLGood read."
1,SLOW SHIPPING,"Needed this book ASAP. Ordered Expedited on Aug 23, it's Aug 27 and still no confirmation that they even sent it."
3,"Whoops, some engineer messed up!!","I've had this particular CD in my collection for quite some time...and listened to it amongst my vast collection...only recently did I discover to my amazement that I have at least one song on this CD that is NOT supposed to be on there (Magic Woman Touch) instead of 4th of July Asbury Park -- and also discovered a couple of other songs that are misnamed and possibly also not supposed to be on this particular CD....did some engineer not watch what he or she was doing when this batch of CD' were produced...it's as if two ""greatest hits' versions were burned into one...I guess it's about ten years too late to ask for a refund from where I purchased it..."
5,Some of the Most Beautiful Singing Ever Recorded,"David Daniels' singing on this disc ranges from the spectacular to the sublime, particularly in ""Longe mala."" This great singer continues to make extraordinary recordings-- more can't come too soon."
5,"2 movies, 2 discs","I'm happy to report that the somewhat misleading use of the term ""2 movie set"", while true, is less informative than '2 Disc Set'. Yes indeed this is a 2 disc set, not '1' as widely speculated prior to release (also shown as '1 disc' on Amazon's product page)."
2,"ok,but something's missing!","i was really thrilled to watch these movies as i hadn't seen them in a while. As i watched the first film it was apparent to me that parts of the movie that helped make it great were missing. What happened to the ""right turn clyde"" parts of the movie that really helped to make it famous? I also believe there are scenes with the biker gang that were also omitted. What gives? Does Warner Bros. really think we wont notice this? If anyone is still in possession of the original cut of this movie either on dvd or vhs, keep it and skip this version. That is, unless you don't mind the best parts of your movies being edited out."
4,Awesome,I love both of these movies and enjoyed watching them several times so far. I am glad I have added it to my collection
1,No English Language on Any Which Way You Can - Tried twice,"I bought this blu-ray 2-movie pack from Costco and ""Any Which Way But Loose"" plays fine (though I see absolutely no difference from the regular DVD to the Blu-Ray, picture or sound wise)But on ""Any Which Way You Can"" there is no english vocals or sound, just dead silence. However, it plays the sound and vocals in every other language offered, just not english.I took it back and got another dvd and the same thing...what is up with that?? I just bought the Sony Blu-ray player and did all the updates available, so it can't be the player."
4,Beware! This comes with a picture on the box!,I had bought 2 of these for my kids for Christmas. There is no warning about the box showing the contents. My surprise was ruined.I have never had this problem before with Amazon.Just wanted to make sure everyone else is aware.
5,I love interracial love stories,"Especially during the Fur trade era. This was the first western book I have ever read. I have the first one, So Wild a dream and the third one Dancing with a Golden Bear. So far the second one is the best one. I didn't like the third sequel, because well, the marriage between Sam Morgan and Meadowlark, does not last. She dies in Dancing with a Golden Bear. Which is why I like this book, because it has a happy ending."
5,Semper Fidelis,The Fifth Marines are one of the most famous regiments in the Corps and this history relates the story in a very readable and succinct narrative. Within the overarch of the history are the stories of the men who made the Fifth Marines famous. Ronald J. Brown uses his talent as a story teller to bring real history to life.
3,"Nice overall, but don't forget it swings","Nice and modern design with a reasonable price point. We got the Danze faucets too so it matches nicely. My draw back is when you get toilet paper from it, the U shape bar swings back and forth. The smaller the roll gets the bigger the angle it swings, and the more it swings back and forth. It just keeps swinging when you pull the paper down, and have to hold the roll steady to tear off the paper. It gets a bit annoying. I wish it was stabilized, or at least the connection point was tighter so it doesn't swing so much."
