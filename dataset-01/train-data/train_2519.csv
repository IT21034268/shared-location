2,Not Quite What We Expected,"This is a great concept and we were excited to get it, but disappointed when it arrived. The bases come all together with a nice, heavy-duty carry bag, mallet, string so you get the bases properly set out, etc. BUT the bases themselves were made of a light canvas material and did not appear to be regulation size. It says on the back ""Not recommended for use with cleats"" and they looked like they would get very dirty (no way to clean them?) and very worn out quickly. It comes with plates (approx. 3""x3"") that go in the ground and the bases attach to these plates with velcro - we never set them out but it seems like once someone dug in as they round a base or slide, the bases would come free fairly easily. I am returning the product - if it was less expensive, I'd probably keep it but it just doesn't seem worth $45. We had planned to just use it in the backyard - I definitely wouldn't recommend it in a team practice setting."
5,Great for the backyard,"My son has taken up baseball the last year and loves it. He wanted bases so I purchased this set. How can you go wrong. 3 bases, home plate, pitching plate/rubber. It is great for baseball, wiffleball, kickball, etc...."
5,Essential and Unsurpassed,"There's no other way to put it. Beside Cooke's landmark musical analysis, all other examinations of Wagner's Ring Cycle shrink to insignificance. This work is absolutely vital to anyone who'd genuinely grasp the unique musical language of this greatest of operatic masterpieces. Before Cooke, musical commentary was limited to pitiful motif lists. Analysts seem to have quite ignored Wagner's own belief the musical language of his vast tetralogy evolves organically. Cooke is the first to grasp and investigate this concept and, to this day, the only one to fathom it in so complete a manner. He presents his brilliant discoveries with succinct easily-grasped verbal explanations illustrated by sonic examples either from the great Solti recording, or created specially for this analysis, an unmistakable gauge of how much Sir Georg believed in Cooke's work. And rightly so, for it is the most revealing window ever opened onto the inner workings of Wagner's towering achievement."
5,A very useful Musical-Thematic analysis.,"This set analyses the motifs used in the Ring and especially emphasizes their inter-relationships. It describes ""families"" of related motifs, and also shows how certain themes are altered as the work as a whole progresses. It is the most useful preparation for listening to or seeing the Ringthat I know, short of a study of the score itself, but it requires no technical musical knowledge or ability to read music."
1,Do not waste your time & money!!,"I love Bugs cartoons but this is very short clips with most of the time taken up by '80s celebraties well-wishers. Tiresome, not entertaining nor funny. I would not give this film even 1 star, but the format did not allow for zero."
2,Stay away from the rated r version,"Once again the censors do a skin-o-max movie wrong. The reason most people rent or buy flicks like this is for soft-core / couples sexy viewing. We all understand that the plot and acting is typically low rate but we count on some camp, humor and of course some sexy people in sexy scenes. This R rated version up for sale here is cut to shreads! I suggest finding a store that carries the un-rated version where the sex is better and the views are not hampered by up-tight censors."
2,Ringo,"I have to say that i was disappointed by the poor variety of this album. I did not expect displays of enormous talent from the most limited of the 'fab four', but all the tracks are predictable and dull with very few redeemimg features. Only for the avid collector"
2,Ringo Plays Rockabilly,"Again, I have to ask: Why release this collection of tunes in CD format when the album sold terribly?Ringo is till trying to find his post-Beatles niche. Unfortunately, ""Rockabilly"" isn't the answer. True, he has some ""big names"" in the business helping him on this CD, including Elvis's backup singers. But even with this help, Ringo is simply not convincing as a C&W / Rockabilly artist. The title track, ""Beaucops of Blues,"" is the strongest offering on this CD. So much so that it was included in the ""Blast From Your Past"" collection.If you really want to hear Ringo at his best, then I suggest you purchase ""Ringo"" and ""Vertical Man."" The LP ""Ringo"" produced such memorable tunes as ""Photograph"" (with George Harrison), ""I am the Greatest"" (with Sir Winston O'Boogie), ""You're 16,"" and ""Oh My My."" The ""Ringo"" CD also offers Sir Richard's greatest number, ""It Don't Come Easy,"" as a bonus track.""Beaucoups of Blues"" just doesn't cut it, not even at bargain prices."
1,WORST CALENDAR EVER,"From the cover and description, I expected a calendar with a new cocktail recipe every few days, and so far the only cocktail has been some putrid mimosa wannabe for Jan. 1. Granted I'm only on the 11th day of the year, but so far every day's tidbit of ""cocktail-related"" information has been worse than the day before! The quotes are flat out dumb, the ""facts"" are pointless, and as i mentioned before the cocktail recipes are non-existent. Save your money and buy a chia-pet because watching that grow for 365 days would provide more daily entertainment than this lame calendar."
4,A very good performance.,"I appreciate, in this recording, expecially the choir. But the singers and the conductor are good too. What a pity not to have the text of this pleasant and important oratorio."
2,An inferior presentation,"Skip this trash. Save your money. This version of Israel in Egypt is very poor. The singers are weak, even the choir is bad. If you want to hear the best Israel in Egypt, you must try to find the one conducted by Maurice Abravanel, with the Utah SO and Chorus (label Westminster, # 5623 in Brazil, in the 60's...). Blanche Christensen and Collen Bischoff are wonderfull sopranos, Grace Bumbry a very good contralto, Dale Blackburn (tenor),Don Watts & Warren Woods (bass) are splendid. The Orchestra and Chorus are magnificent, and Abravanel the master. But the reason of this sucess is that they performed with joy, believing in (always fantastic) Handel's work. Try to find one copy or write to Vanguard to re-issue this jewel. But do not loose your time with ""ersatz"" works. Get the real thing."
3,picture this live,"I bought this cd a few weeks ago. I'v heard better, but the cd was ok, overall. If you like their style of music, I would reccommend buying this album. The band is pretty great, but they've put out better cd's than this one."
1,This Item,"This item is NOT a $300 gps unit!!! Be careful. It is not a eTrex Legend Cx. It is a Etrex Legend, a $150 unit.ball hog"
4,5 stars; So close,"Lights work well, but the batteries that it came with was dead. I had to spend money to buy new ones."
1,Genre is acquired taste and this is the worst of this genre,"This genre of Asian centrefold is not for everyone but for lovers of this style, this is easily the worst one. She's an attractive, slender model but the video is boring for the initiated let alone the casual viewer. SHe wanders around with the top of her dress around her waste for an hour and it looks as though this has been censored for sone scenes. A waste."
3,service could be better,"I bought this sticker simply because it said, ""carpe diem"". Things that say carpe diem on them are rare. My only complaint was the time it took for me to get it. I ordered other stuff at the same time through amazon.com with their free shipping deal and I got ALL of that stuff before I got this sticker. Also take note of the size of the sticker. It's listed but most people don't pay attention. I assumed the sticker would've been bigger."
5,Extremely Educational and Entertaining,"This amazing book is truly one of a kind. I would highly recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in ""germs"", microbiology, or personal hygiene, and it is an absolute must read for biology or medical students. Dr. Tierno educates the reader on the world of germs and their amazing interactions with the human race. His style would, in my opinion, be easily read and enjoyed by both casual readers and members of the scientific community. I highly recommend this book!"
2,Not a Fan,"I bought this book on the recommendations posted on this page but found it disappointing. Uninteresting ancedotes, hard to get into, didnt even finish it. Its a fascinating part of the world but this book doesnt do justice to it."
4,great tool for moderate use,"have been using this for free hand routing and cutting into pine and plywood for a year. this is a very powerful tool with multiple options for cutting, grinding and shaping. works as advertised. only problem is frequent removal of sawdust from the work area to keep the cut clean and smooth - this is a common problem with all tools of this kind. there are no vaccum ports / nor is it convenient to attach a shop vaccum when you are doing free hand cutting."
1,deceived,"In ordered this toll under the assumption that it came with a hard tool case. after receiving it with a duffel bag, I called Amazon and they told me they would send a replacement, and promised me that they would make sure it came with the hard tool case as stated. When I received the replacement tool it also came with a bag. All Amazon could tell me is I guess it doesn't come with the Hard case. I'm very disappointed in Amazon"
3,It's a Nora Roberts book,"I read a lot of Nora Roberts and I love almost all of her trilogies and series.I read this one in about 8 hours, and maybe I read too fast but I didn't particularly like this one.The characters didn't feel as real to me in this book as they do in her other books. I felt like Nash didn't have as much personality as some of her other male characters have in other books.I did like the story and the ending was a bit of a surprise...I wasn't completely expecting it. I especially liked her descriptions of the magical scenes and the romantic scenes."
5,Donovan fun,This the beginning of a fun and precious family journey. You will love them all so plan to read the series. Morgana and Nash are the perfect start for your trip.
1,Just Wasn't Interesting,"I ordinarily love this author, but I simply couldn't get into this story. It was rather lifeless and the characters dull."
4,Sweet Story but Not Captivating,"I have to admit I was not completely captivated by this story. The ending (last 30 pages or so) was great - surprise and utter romance. Everything leading up to the ending was pretty repetitive and uneventful, except for the few witch demonstrations. But due to the ending of the book, I recommend it to any Nora Roberts fan."
2,A disappointed Nora Roberts read,"Nora Roberts is one of my favorite authors. However, Captivated fell flat for me. The problem - No Plot.The book was first published in 1992. If you are a fan of Ms. Roberts, you can see how much she's grown as a writer in the last 12 years, if you've read of her more recent works.I like all the characters, I just wish they were doing something other than the cliche'.After I bought this book, a co-worker noticed that I had it, because she's a big NR fan, too. She said she couldn't get into it, and neither could I. I finished it (she didn't), but not without forcing myself to pick it up and do so.Skip this series, it's not worth it."
5,GOOOD BOOK,"JUST LOVE THE SERIES, THIS ONE IS MY FOVORITE. JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF EVERYTHING THAT MAKES A BOOK A ""GOOD READ"""
4,A fun escape...,"Though I find her story lines fairly predictable I always enjoy reading a Nora Roberts book. The Donovan Legacy is proving to be no different. Though I may know what's coming and how the characters will ultimately end up the story is so enjoyable that I don't mind! Roberts is very skillfull at developing her characters and their backgrounds, circumstances, and surroundings that I can't help but be captivated by them (pun intended ;->).I will always endorse Nora Roberts, so enjoy!"
5,jade Warrior - Island discs remastered,"Among the most neglected bands in history, and during the brief ISLAND record label years, one of the most progressive for their time...FLOATING WORLD, WAVES, KITES and WAY OF THE SUN..... I used to listen to these 4 albums (the pinnacle of Jade Warrior production) But in the 70's the LP pressings were not ideal, even the expensive imports had noisy grooves. Recently I discovered these unique treasures were remastered by ECLECTIC. They have all the full sound and separation of those originals -- sans snap, crackle and pop. Thank God.Good liner notes as well.For the newcomer, here's who they are...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Warrior_(band)"
3,sound very disturbing,"Jade Warrior albums were recorded with the most sophisticated and up to date technology available at the time. Reprogramming this material has been a difficult task. They have succeeded on the reproduction, but here is where the problem lies. These albums were recorded too good to transfer over to 2008 technology. The dynamic ranges are so divided and pristine that the average listener's equipment has trouble seperating the the varied levels of volume. The listener ends up adjusting the volume more than he does enjoying the music."
5,"one of the best ambient albums by anybody, ever","It is wonderful that this album is now available remastered, cleaned up, and on CD. It's huge dynamic range was not catered for well by the poor quality of oil-crisis era vinyl, which may be why ""Waves"" never became the breakthrough album that it should have been.No vocals, no abruptly loud happy/manic bits, but loads of intricate layers of guitar, flute, percussion (including temple bells, etc), in a continuous instrumental piece inspired by the ocean. No formal track divisions other than those corresponding to the two sides of the original record, but the detailed inlay card breaks each half down into sub-sections with titles that evoke specific images.Jade Warrior's very best album, and one of the best ambient CD's ever. Way ahead of its time."
3,"attractive, but disappointing construction","I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift, but am debating whether or not to give it to her. The item is colorful, but the front is rough, the pin's construction does not seem very sturdy, and the backing is just glued on. All in all, I think it might be worth 15 dollars at most, much less than what it cost."
5,I love Darian,"I'm a long time fan of Darian O'Toole, one of the stars of your movie and while I was willing to except a cheesy indie horror flick, I was more than pleasantly surpised to find a sophisticated, funny, eerie and chilling drama/suspense film. Your casting of Darian (don't worry I won't ruin it) is inspired and the only bad thing I could say is where was our diva during the middle of the film? Inspired! My Gawd she's amazing on screen! Kudos to Grefe, Hess and most of all, the alluring and brilliant Darian! And FYI, I'm real!Doug MacDonald"
5,Great transaction,This book came in a very timely matter... even sooner then I was expecting it. The book was in great condition and packaged well so it did not get trashed during the shipping process. Was very happy with this purchase.
2,Great idea but the parts don't hold up.,I have been looking for a respirator that I could use in my shop and I thought I had found one with the Triton. It could be an excellent product but cheep parts have made it questionable. The air-hose can be torn without much effort and should have been made of durable material. I have repaired the air hose with duct tape three times! The helmet visor is easily scratched and also should have been made of a scratch resistant material - I can hardly see out of mine. The battery lasts a long time but you have to wait until it almost goes out before charging. A charge takes over 10 hours and unless you have another battery standing by your are out of luck. Mine seems to go out just as I need it most and want to finish a project. The most exasperating thing about all this is that this respirator is a great idea and could have been marvelous product. With a few changes it could be fantastic. I will still use mine; at least until the duct tape runs out.
2,A little too much,"Although there is nothing wrong with the product iteself, my husband has never used it! Its a little much and alien looking to actually wear I think.. But the airflow does work perfectly if you are willing to look crazy when you put it on!"
3,Triton Air Shield,"Useing the air shield I have found it to be cumbersom, visability is distorted by the shield due to the beveled plastic visor. You cannot get the true angle or depth when woodworking. This can create mistakes in your work. I also found the air flow is a little weak, although it will keep the shield from fogging up while it is on, it is not enough to cool the body and prevent you from sweating, which will cause you to remove the shield and dry yourself off. This product would not be useful in warm to hot weather. The adjustable headband is cheaply designed which allows it to loosen while you ar wearing and working , creating you to constantly stop and readjust the fit. The clear plastic visor collects dust quickly when sanding and requires constant cleaning, wiping it off will begin to scratch the surface due to the wood particles. Eventually visor replacement will become necessary and possibly expensive."
2,Not for summer use,"Bought this last winter and at the time I loved it. Well today I went out to my shop to work and after an hour I couldn't stand it anymore and took it off. It was just too hot. My shop is not air conditioned, I just have fans which you can not feel with this on and the built in fan on it is way under powered. I will not be using it until winter comes back or I figure a way to connect it to a more powerful fan. Works fine in cool weather but not hot. Unless your shop is air conditioned I would NOT recommend it."
2,Nice on design low on airflow,Nice design but needs more airflow. Still find fiberglass insulation particles inside the face shield when used in my attic. Is it possible that the airflow with clean filter is low enough that breathing in causes a short air pressure differental and allows the paricles into the helmet at the cracks/gaps? Tried taping all the cracks and leaving the neck cord just ever so slightly loose and still get particles in the helment on the face shield. Did not quite live up to my expectations because of this. So only 2 stars.
4,Love it but..,"Works really well, couldn't as for better performance. Quality of workmanship leaves something to be desired. Shortly after the second charge everything shut down. Found that one of the single strand wires from the battery had broken. A quick solder job took care of the problem, but don't think it should have failed after 9 hours at the price.Performance is absolutely great with the lathe, router table, table saw and Leigh Dovetail Jig. Use it at with all power tools except the bandsaw, scroll saw, planer, jointer and drum sander where my dust collector is adequate. The absolutely best respirator I have ever used."
3,"Good design, but poor problem resolution","I really liked the respirator when I first got it, the overall design is well thought out. After a few weeks of use, I had been having some problems fogging the lens, so I checked the airflow with the provided airflow meter, and the airflow had dropped dramatically, far below what was specified in the manual. A little experimentation showed that the most of the airflow reduction was in the prefilter. I called Triton, and they first told me to disregard the flow meter, but I pushed harder and they admitted that I might have gotten a prefilter with some kind of a coating that limited airflow. That was apparently a known problem. When I asked to order more prefilters they said vaguely that it might be six months! I will probably end up making some kind of prefilter myself."
5,the wisdom and classical teachings of the Sanatan Dharma,"The Swami Purana, written and translated with unparalleled erudition and devotion by Swami Satyananda Saraswati, is a brilliant anthology of some of the tales that illustrates the wisdom and classical teachings of the ""Sanatana Dharma."" This particular collection of folklore is an excellent resource for people from all walks of life, from those who are scholars in the field to those who are looking for an introduction to Hinduism. Swamiji provides us with a handy and clear explanation of Sanskrit pronunciation in all his books, including this one. The stories themselves exist on several layers of meaning. One could read them as mythology or allegory, depending on the context. However one chooses to read the Swami Purana, all will derive great enjoyment and pleasure and will learn much about the vast and rich heritage of Hinduism."
3,Not my style,"It looks a little cheap to me. The gold is brassy looking and the rhinestone ""g's"" on either side of the face is much more prevelant that the photo suggests."
4,A little more effort needed here...,"This wasn't a bad video, but some parts of it weren't as good as they COULD have been. I mean, this hot blonde android (Veronica) is accidentally sent back in time to the present, where she ends up working for a guy who produces sexy catalogs. Veronica is so hot she's abducted by the competition, which includes a beautiful brunette as boss. There's a great scene where this brunette takes the blonde into her bedroom for what should-have-been a dynamite lezzie scene, but was just a bit too mechanical for my taste. Still, a good effort nonetheless, just not as good as it COULD have been."
4,Not bad for softcore,"This is quite possibly the best softcore video i've seen, all of the girls are hot (Julia and Nikki in particular) and thank goodness they put a good lez scene in this one with these two which is in my opinion the best in the movie (my girlfriend actually enjoyed this one) and thats always a plus when you can watch these things with your girl and she enjoys it but definitely pick this one up, quite possibly the best softcore flick out there. Very enjoyable."
2,Where are the cigar labels?,"As usual Ms. Grafton provides color and variety in the graphics; this book on cigar labels, however, only has a handful of graphics which are actually labelled as 'cigar labels.' Some of the graphics only indicate they are related to cigars by the men smoking in the pictures. The graphics appear to be poor copies with no indication as to what they are. They could be pictures taken out of an old magazine with no cigar seals or maker."
2,Very Average,Spandau Ballet was a Catchy 80's Band.They had a Certain SMooth Style to their music.In Fact I saw a Show which Showed Sade in the Background of their Video.True is a Classic Cut but nothing else here comes clost to matching that song's Charm.
3,Child of the River was enjoyable,"I only wish it was a trilogy, the plot in the first book is too short, for me. The concept of confluence is intriguing, I especially like the machines. True the characters and the plot could be developed more. Maybe in the other books in the series they will be."
2,A Poor Imitation of Gene Wolfe,"While I certainly understand Mr. McAuley's wish to pay a tribute to Wolfe's masterpiece ""The Book of the New Sun,"" ""Child of the River"" lacks the clarity of vision, quality of writing, and strong story line of that masterpiece. Mr. McAuley's awkward writing style and bad grammar is terribly distracting. Although at times he manages to conjure interesting images and (very rarely) injects philosophical ideas into the story, the characters and plot devices are hopelessly cliched. Mr. McAuley is not without talent, but he needs to pare down the excessive verbiage and work harder on developing his characters. For better ""Wolfesque"" writing, try Paul Park's ""Starbridge Chronicles"" and Patrick O'Leary's ""The Gift."""
3,OK-Predictable story line.,"I enjoyed the literary style of the writer. The story was alright, however I thought it was pretty predictable-no real surprises on the different character roles or what the overall conclusion is bound to be. The world of the confluence is a wonderful concept and was delightful to read about from a fantasy standpoint, but there are the typical plot twists that have become sort of the ""norm"" in SF ,ie the bad guys are really the good guys and the good guys are really the bad guys; hero is from a special background which gives him special powers to deal with any situation even though he can't think of anything to do; everybody knows all about him but nobody will tell him (even though it might be pretty obvious to the reader by this time). It's OK."
2,Not what I thought I was getting.,"The build quality of this product is totally fine. The failure here is in the description. By looks I thought I was getting a unit that used fanfold post its. This is a unit that uses the standard top glued post its. I was disappointed because the description of the product didn't indicate which type of post its it was made for, so I had to take a chance and lost.If you want a unit that dispenses top glued post its this is a totally fine unit."
1,Not what's pictured,"This is not at all what is pictured. I was hoping to get the holder for the fan-type post its along with the page markers, just like the picture shows. This is just something to set your regular post it pad on, it's not even a dispenser. Very dissapointing."
2,Disappointing recording,"When I saw the cast for this recording, I anticipated a winner. Not so.The biggest flaw is the very poor conducting by Previtali- pedestrian, laboured, far too slow. He never gives any of the singers a chance. Milanov is in poor voice- sad, because Leonora was one of her most famous roles. She tends to 'scoop', and there is virtually no evidence of her famous legatos and pianissimos. Di Stefano, likewise, sounds very unhappy, and sings flat most of the time. He varies between shouting and crooning. Elias is good, but has an impossible task to create a vibrant Preziosilla with the laborious conducting. Tozzi (as Padre guardiano), Mantovani (as Melitone), and the chorus are fine as far as the conductor allows. Warren is in fine voice, and gives an excellent interpretation- a great Carlo. But the recording is fatally flawed by the conductor."
4,Worth Your Money!,"Some of the transfers in this set aren't great, but you know what?This box set is equivalent to finding 50 movies at a yard sale for about .50 cents apiece! It doesn't matter what the movie quality is like, at this point, it's a steal!Some friends and I watched 'Memorial Valley Massacre' together and had a great time. In fact, I laughed more watching that film than I have during some 'comedies' distributed by Hollywood recently...And if you don't have a copy of Bad Taste (good VHS-like transfer by the way) and Dario Argento's Deep Red in your collection, snag this set now!"
3,Would be 5 stars but...,"The only reason I bought this collection was for ""Deadtime Stories"". My copy didn't have it for some reason. It had ""Devil Times Five"", though, which doesn't seem to be in the listed movies that another kind reviewer posted. Also, my copy seems to be missing ""Christmas Evil"". Very odd. It's still a great and valuable collection of films worth having, but I feel cheated without ""Deadtime Stories"". Strange."
1,WARNING,WARNING this 50 pack is sometimes sent with different movies than the descriptionI got mine without the outside box and different movies on itno bad tasteno deep redno good 50 pack
1,Still waiting for the chills...,"Though I Knew they were old B-movies, and that the price was fair, I found that I just let go myself for the nostalgia of a past era, somehow idealized... So far I've seen only 10 movies and they all suck completely. I'm not saying I was robbed or anything, I just found out that my taste on old movies has changed I don't even know if i'm going to go through all 50 movies"
3,Chilling classics Movie pack,A nice collection of older movies of this type but poorly cut. No efforts where made to improve the quality of the films. Poor audio and some of the movies don't play well! I was dissapointed with this but I enjoy many of the films.
2,You get what you pay for...,"terrible film-DVD transfers, and yes, you get 50 movies for about $13, but look at the titles carefully. if you feel you can enjoy at least 2 of the movies, then this set is worth it (for me it was being able to watch ""Horror Express"" and ""Bad Taste"" for the 1st time in decades). otherwise - WOW! there's a lot of crappy movies in the box!"
1,COMPLETELY HORRIBLE DVD TRANSFER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I used to rent THE MILPITAS MONSTER on a top-notch 1980's VHS tape in anold video rental store years ago every time!It was one of my all-time favorites!Sadly,with this DVD release version of the film there was nocare taken AT ALL TO RESTORE IT!Even worse,the voices don't even matchthe mouths when the characters are speaking,as if the film was some sortof horribly English-dubbed foreign film!And also,the DVD is completelylacking of any SPECIAL FEATURES whatsoever!At least the 1980's VHS tapewas the first video back then to ACTUALLY include the film's originalTHEATRICAL TRAILER!!!!!!!!!!!!I hope this review was helpful."
4,Get the 2005 version,"The one you want to get is the 2005 version with the blue cover and the skull, earlier sets of this include deadtime stories, bad taste, virus, etc. They were recalled because some of the movies had copyright issues. The newer sets are dull."
3,Chiling Classics,"I like the movies so far, quality wasn't my concern but I love old classics, so this is good from the few I have watched. Will have to take more time to check out the rest before making final decision overall. Great price for what is there...."
2,Whu Hoppened?,"I wish I had read these reviews first and got the original Chilling pack instead of the recent edition. I wanted so bad to see the Ken Russell flick Gothic... too bad. Boris Karloff in Snake People... sorrrrry. All the movies I WANTED had been removed. And they left that awful Massacre movie... it's not campy, it's not ""chilling""... it's just mean. I hated that movie. If you can't get the original 50 pack, don't get this... they took all the good movies out for some reason."
1,so bad they're awful,"I like old movies that are so bad ,they are good. They give you a chuckle about the way things were, the funny mistakes and the quirky dialogue . These movies are just plain BAD. unwatchable in some cases. Don't waste your time or money."
3,oh well,I was a little disappointed when my DVD set arrived. The product description had listed some different movie titles that are not included in this set. I understand copyright issues and that is probably the reason why. Amazon needs to update their product descriptions.
3,Chilling Classics review,"I found the movies drawn out and boring. It says digally remasterd, however they looked more like boot legger material. Ive seen older movies that were in excelent condition that werent all blury and dark!Not to mention all though some of the movies had a decent ending they took to long to get to the point, it felt like a waist of time and way to perdictable in some cases. There was alot of nudity that was uncalled for and afensive in the movie.I miss the old fashion, down to earth movie.Like the older vesion the ""The Fog"" crystal clear movie, not drawn out or boring, no unneeded nudity, everyone can watch! The newer vesion of ""The Fog"" is an insalt and not even related to what the story was about!Thats just my thoughts."
1,ripoff,"So glad that I auditioned this set from my local public library, rather than springing for this atrocity. On a really slow night, I managed to watch parts of 12 films on 3 disks. All of the dozen prints that I saw appeared to have been rescued from the dumpster or the incinerator; they were honestly that bad. They weren't scratched - they were gouged. They didn't jitter - they lurched. Sharply discontinuous splices were frequent. In terms of sound distortion, color inaccuracy, lack of sharpness, contrast and saturation, they looked worse than most of my old VHS tapes. Technically speaking, an abuse of the DVD medium. Content-wise, I'd only consider them ""B"" material if no lower grade existed. Ugh."
1,Where is Deadtime Stories??!!!,I bought this set just for that movie and IT'S NOT ON HERE!! Why?! I am so mad!
1,Boring,"The 1 star isn't for the subpar sound or picture quality - I expected that, however, any movie, even B-movies, should have some entertainment value. Every movie I watched was painfully dull and was worse than watching paint dry. There might be 1 movie in the 50 that isn't incredibly tedious but I'm not wasting my time trying to find out. Do yourself a favor and take the $15.00 you would spend on this collection and buy 1 good movie that you'll actually enjoy watching."
1,Help,"A question for anyone who has this dvd pack. I am after a movie my friends and I watched years ago. It was about a lady going out for cigarettes on a wet night and having to stop for petrol on the way home. A killer is running lose as we hear on the news, playing on the car radio. The petrol attendant worries her in the way he is acting. He tries to get her out of the car but she wont. He attacks the car trying to get her out. What she does not realise is the killer is in the back of her car and the attendant is only trying to save her... This short movie was on with 3 other movies one being about a boy being sucked into a video game. We would greatly appreciate any help finding out the name of the dvd or tape which has these four short stories on it. We are wondering if they are on this dvd or any of the others listed with amazon. Thank you. Aussie Girls"
2,JimmieL,"The delivery was quick, however the quality of the picture on most of the movies leaves a lot to be desired."
4,Excellent 50Pack of Oldies Movies,"I would definitely recommend this 50Pack of Chilling Classics. Maybe they are not classics in the strict sense of the word but I found many of these films enjoyable viewing. On some discs, which had usually 4 movies per disc, I enjoyed as many as 3 of the movies and there were few discs on which none of the movies were worth watching. For the cost, this was a bargain at under $20. The newer movies are for the most part, especially the horror type, too gory, vulgar and disgusting for me. There may have been some of that in some of these titles but for the most part, these movies used atmosphere and plot and less gore to entertain.I would certainly recommend this set for those who like the older films."
2,don't let the cover fool you,"don't waste your time trust me it's not worth it alot of these were a ""watch once"" thing i think there was only four or five that were actualy any good so it's really not worth it"
3,Japanese AV,"What can I say about Manami Suzuki. She is sexy and I must confessed she is good actor. I gave it 3 stars because of Manami. It is a good ""softcore"" DVD. I like the music and it is good to have on during poker night. The editing is still jumping and can be done more smoothly. I must confess that the producers of these DVD must look toward the USA for what is the best camera angles that would be erotic. Lets get them new ""toys"" and its okay to show other body parts. I know these JAV actors are the best in their country and they should demand to have the best camera and editing persons to do their films. Thumbs up!"
3,Here's the thing....,"Ok, let me lay it out straight. Daisy is an airgun company, used to making air rifles that get up to 1100 FPS and shoots pellets. My guess is that this is an experiment in a popular industry gone REALLY bad. This probably has the performance of those questionable CYMA airsoft products. So I won't hold this against them, but try to find a better airsoft."
2,very weak and breaks easily,"if you want this gun think twice. It is very weak it only goes up to a couple inches and its not for people to compete with. And if you drop it, sure it will still work but the saftey will break, the clip wont hold a lot of bb's, and the clip will fall out of the gun. This is gun is for little kids who want a bb gun. Because its not powerful enought to pierce the skin cause i got shot in the chest by this gun. Didnt hurt."
2,Its... Ok,This gun isnt great in a airsoft war. The bbs curve very easily and drop fairly soon after firing. This gun is heavy as well. I might add it has jamming issues at times. I only recommend this for beginners.
4,Good Cheap Backup Pistol,Good cheap Backup pistol to your full auto rifle. It is fairly accurate and does not jam or swipe up at end of shot. Good for capture the flag and pistol only battles.
2,Poor examples,"This book is very poorly written. I was disappointed especially after reading the well written Choice Theory book by William Glasser. The book provides examples of senarios in which a person responds using external control and then give a ""better"" responce using choice theory. In many of the examples, the choice thoery response is not even relevant to the original situation. There are a few good examples in the book; howver I believe that overall it is a waste of money. If one reads the Choice Theory book and grasps the understanding, there is no reason to purchase the ""Language of"" book."
2,Disappointed in price,If it weren't for the price I would give it more stars.It was worth 3.99 but certainly not more.
2,disappointing,"I did not know that the ""book"" would only include one-liners on each page as examples of the language; I thought it would explain the ""language"" in more in depth."
3,Wish I borrowed it first,"I am en elementary music teacher, and I was excited about this purchase. After reading this book, I was disappointed because I didn't find a lot of lessons/resources that I felt I could have used in my room--at least not for the price. This book just sits on my shelf. On the other hand, the lessons are clear and it gives very detailed action steps. It could possibly be something good to leave for a sub. I did not get much use out of the product. BUY USED!"
4,Perfect for Halloween!!!,"I heard bad things about this movie, but I was still very curious to see it. I'm so glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews, because this movie is good ol' fashioned cheesy fun. You got eight classic monsters (Cyclops, Swamp Gut, Frankenstein, Lady Vampire, Werewolf, Mummy, Witch Bitch and Zombie Man) that battle each other to the death in a boxing ring in the middle of an abandoned and cursed graveyard. Buzz Chambers and Sasquatch Sid are the play-by- play announcers. Before each battle, we see the monster's backstory and how they got there. Like I said, this would be great to watch around Halloween. I highly recommend MONSTER BRAWL!!!"
2,No real story to latch onto,"Monster Brawl is one of those rare cases where the movie is exactly summed up with the description on the cover. It's literally just a series of sequences in which famous monsters are paired in the ring...over and over and over, with no real point.Had the creators added some kind of subplot or other story line, we might have had a cult classic here. As it stands, this is a failed experiment. Jimmy Hart was funny though. He was the highlight of the movie."
3,A Great Party Movie,"Monster brawl is what it's title states, an all out ""Monster Mash"" of the creepiest, most disgusting monsters on the planet. O.K., i know i sound like a member of the publicity team for this film, but you must take it for what it is. Monster Brawl is a fun romp, with cool monsters, great kill scenes and some pretty decent special effects. The Cemetery set is really atmospheric and the back stories of each monster lends some needed light to their mystique. I took a gamble and ordered this DVD sight unseen and I am very glad I did. This is one film i will watch every time a bunch of family and friends get together for a rowdy, good time. Is it a classic, not by any means. Is it fun, different and entertaining..YEP! I just hope I can get my hand on some tickets for the rematch. Now, wheres my scalpers phone number?"
3,A monster movie that plays like A UFC pay-per-view. Not a horrible movie and kinda entertaining. But overall nothing to it,"""Tonight the most anticipated extreme sporting event ever."" 8 monsters, including Frankenstein and Cyclops, square off in a UFC type movie to determine who is the toughest monster of them all. There really is nothing to review here. The movie is pretty much a back story of the two fighters and then the fight. Think ""Celebrety Deathmatch"" meets ""Bubba Ho-tep"". This is kind of entertaining and a little funny but really nothing more then watching ""Wrestlemania"" with horror monsters. Since that is all this is there is really nothing more to say and since there is no real substance it is hard to review. I won't give it a grade but I will say that if you are a fun of cheesy monster movies and UFC then this is made for you."
2,Monstrers in a Ring.,"All this movie is about are monsters fighting and killing each other in a ring. You get some announcers on the side making remarks about the fights but that is about it. There is nothing special about this movie. I like monster movies as much as the next person but this movie was more lame than entertaining. I understand it was made from a low budget but please be more creative. The only part I liked was the monsters make up. So if you want to watch an actual movie stay away from this so called movie. There is nothing special with visual, sound, or storyline. I give this movie a D."
3,good J2me game,"I have played this game on my 6600, It is a nice game to play on the tube during the dull and boring journey home from work. Just that java games tend to be slightly slow compared to symbian games."
3,Brazilian Quality,"The people who love Brithney and Christina Aguilera must hear this brazilian teen singer. Her songs are very nice, but all the songs was recorded in her own language (portuguese)... All the way, the rhythm is very nice."
4,good for ear candle,"There were no ear candle instructions as the manufacturer claims. When I got this I was worried maybe I bought incenses instead. The package does not indicate at all this can be used for ear wax - maybe it's a liability issue?I've used similar products before, and since this looked familiar enough I used it anyway. Everything worked fine."
1,Hoax? Honest systematic mistake?,"The product we received IS NOT the product pictured and described at this site. These are standard incense candles. I should have read all the negative reviews before hitting ""Buy it now."" Please do that if you want to avoid time-consuming hassle of returning useless stuff."
1,"Was sent the wrong item, and they did nothing about it.","I ordered these candles and got a pack of incense. When I complained about it, Amazon sent my complaint to someone else. Ill never order again."
5,Great Product,Works amazingly well! I love this product and is planning on purchasing more! Thank you for fast delivery~!
1,Ear Wax or Beeswax?,"I used theses as advertised for ear candling. I got so much wax in the candle and was thinking I had really dirty ears until I realized it was coming from the candle. This product should not be listed under the ear candles. It also did not have any fragrance so you really could not call it ""aroma therapy"" either. All around this is a true waste of money."
1,Ear candles are a hoax!,"Ear candles are a homeopathic scam. Don't believe me? Burn the candle by it'self and whalah!!! Magic ear wax!!! Test #2... Take the ear candle and burn it while holding the other end in a glass of water. If it doesn't start sucking up water, it is not creating a vacuum effect. It won't. You are allowed to burn your money any way you like, just thought I'd warn you. I'm not against homeopathics, but this one surely is a fake."
1,False advertisement,"The product description is misleading stating that these are ear candles, but upon receiving the item it turns out this is not the case. The instructions for use state ""Place incense candle in incense holder and light"" NO ear canceling instructions are included."
1,Serious loss of features in new design,"This tool is much more limited than the original Rotozip and is misadvertized. The Amazon (and others) description states ""This 5.5 amp, VS (15,000 - 30,000 rpm) tool saws, cuts, grinds, sands and polishes!"" It does not! There is no longer a zipmate attachment that allows grind, sand and polish attachments. Beware that those attachments sold for ""Rotozip"" do not attach to the new series of units. Unfortunately, since this new series of Rotozip tool is so limited, I'm returning mine, and I recommend you consider a different tool if you want multipurpose features at all."
2,This is one of those tools I just don't use,"You know, it looks great in the video, and it does what it says, but honestly, I never use it. I can do the same thing with other tools I already have on the job, and none of the guys are used to working with this. The attachments are a pain to swap, and easy to lose. A drill, a grinder, a sawzall, and a handheld drywall saw are always on site and in use anyway, so this stays in the shop. Also, it's a lot harder to get nice straight cuts than it looks. If all you were doing was cutting circles in drywall for two days it might make sense to break this thing out, but in reality, it's more of a pain to bring an extra tool, and switch over, for the few things this might actually do better than another tool. If you don't have other tools maybe this is of more value to you than it is to me, but I would not buy it again."
1,Rotozip sucks,"Rotozip SUCKSthe high hard one...the low limp onebasically anything you put before it , it will suckThe ONLY use I have ever found for this piece of junkin for carving pumpkins...which actually it does really wellonce you develop your technique for controlling it. But it willnot serve anyone well for cutting anytihing more than gyp board andcertainly will not perform as the commercials infer."
2,Rotozip RZ20 (what a rip),"I purchased this 'tool' with the intent to use it for cutting aluminum siding. I'm currently replacing windows and needed to cut the siding and enlarge the opening. I didn't get halfway through the first window before the metal cutting blade became so worn as to be worthless. Ended up using a metal cutting blade on the circular saw to finish the task. I also tried the Rotozip, with the appropriate bit, on cutting some drywall which had to be replaced. It was good for raising a lot of dust but it was quicker to use a drywall saw in the long run.Would I buy this 'tool' again. NOTOct. 31, 04Decided to give this 'tool' another try, this time using it to cut some thin gauge aluminum soffit trim to size. Again, the blade did not last very long. Not only are the blades cheap in quality but also in cost. That's the only positive thing I can say about this item."
4,What do ya' mean No ZipMate?!,"I must disagree with that first reviewer! Bosch has made some design improvements. My Rotozip Rebel quit because of dust and debris in the switch. The cam lock had problems, as did the ZipMate. Bosch took a good design and made it a little more sturdy, enclosed the switch to prevent debris from causing it to foul and made the NEW ZIPMATE ATTACHMENT longer and easier to manuever. They also made changing the bits and attachments easier.They even added an LED light (model RZ20) to see what you're cutting. Some of the new RotoZip tools are compatible with older attachments and vise-versa. (...)"
1,Buyer Beware,"While I was excited about the price of this product, after 3 uses it became clear that you get what you pay for - not! The ""reconditioned"" RotoZip simply died. Don't expect Tool King to go beyond their 30 day return policy. They stand behind that policy 100%."
5,Great product and great price,"Saw and accessories work great , shipping was faster than expected.I would buy again.Tom"
2,Would not buy again,Having a red and white kitchen....... I was excited to get the red muffin pan. Until I used it. I should have guessed that it would be flimsy but although I greased it as directed it is almost impossible to get it clean.
3,Nice muffin pan,"This is a flexible muffin pan that works well. It is not 100% stick-free, but works well enough. I like the red color and matches our kitchen plan."
2,Not quite what I expected.,I was disappointed when I got this for my highschool aged son. It would have been better to get the movie and read the on-line book notes.
4,"Terrific mystery, recommened but...herewith an admonishment","This is the fourth Ferrigno I've very much enjoyed. But, Robert, Robert, Robert, you let me down some with this one. Mind you, this is an excellent mystery and I recommend it but you've trained me to expect (and appreciate) kinky sexual escapades and we don't have any of those here so I'm a bit bereft. Go forth asap and write another and don't forget the luscious kinky sex. There's a good lad."
2,bottom barrel excitment,I think almost all the losers on this card were cut from the ufc or decided to drop down to lightweight. Machida playing it TOO safe for 2 rounds then turning it up in the third when his opponent is tired is not fan friendly.Memorable moments were...BJ destroying Hughes again! great strategy and finish.Lol at sad looking Karo screaming NO!!! after getting tko'dThird round of the main event. Jacksons toe stomps
4,smaller then i thought,"if this were for me i would have rated it a 3 but because the person i got it for still loved it even though it was smaller then expected, i still gave it a 4. and we ordered an 8 which is her normal size but it was very very snug."
3,this item is pretty,i do like this item it is just not what i expected the cross is a little bigger than what it looks but i do like it very much and wear it almost everyday
3,under-impressed,"Sterling Silver Victorian Style Open Cross Ring Size 9(Sizes 5,6,7,8,9)The Picture does not represent the actual ring.. the ring is quite a bit thinner and is very bendable.. my ring even had some tarnish on it... the cross and details on my ring are not straight and uneven if you look closely... its also a lot flatter than the picture portrays, especially the middle of the cross.. its cute and cheap so I kept it.. most people dont notice at first glance.. so I accepted it this way, but not my favorite like I thought it would be.. But the sender was fast and I got it sooner than I expected."
4,Victorian Cross Ring,Really like the ring. It's not as thick as I thought it would be but still sturdy. The sizes seem to run small. I ordered a 10 and it fits like a 9. But overall I love it and would definitely recommend it.
1,Don't buy this filter if you have a Toyota!,"There IS a major difference between this after-market air filter and a dealer filter. It's flimsy, and collapses inside the chamber for the air filter, causing both drag AND bad computer (Check Engine) readings on your vehicle. The difference in the rigidity of this filter vs. Toyota's filter is astounding ... like night and day! Spend the extra money, buy the factory filter, and be done with it. I cannot be more disappointed (after spending over $1400 to replace the Air Flow Meter that sits on-top of the air filter)."
4,A fun and interactive way for learning sign language vocabul,"This wonderful sign language puzzle book helps to assist people who are working at expanding their knowledge of sign language. It has many fun puzzles, word finds and vocabulary building exercises that helps students to practice signs they already may know or to learn new signs. I have used this book as a way to reinforce material taught in my adult education classroom. I recommend this book for anyone who has a need to practice sign language, yet, does not always have an opportunity to sign with another person.Thanks Ms. Riekehoff for another wonderful sign language book!"
3,Great book for beginning bible study,"This was a good book for ideas for Women's Bible study groups. While it had good lessons it often repeated the same theme and wasn't as in depth of study for our group. We have been searching for study material for some time and this book along with others in the series were a great way to start, we quickly outgrew the mild thought provoking lessons. We did use this book as a way to develop our own bible studies geared toward our personal needs. If you're looking for ideas and a way to get started on your own curriculum this is a good way to begin."
4,Good workbook,This book is easy to read and spurs good discussions. I would like it I it prompted deeper questions to ponder.
5,The Role of Women,Through scripture references this book is an excellent guide and reminder of ways and ideas about reaching out and supporting others as we struggle with our own problems and growth.
4,Just Right,"I was looking for something for a young mother's group at my church. The purpose of the group is to encourage one another. This study is ideal. Short and without homework and yet, relevant to our daily Christian walk."
5,Extremely well designed system,"I recently completed work on a 20'x20' wood shop and was in the market for a system to organize my lumber supply which was taking up valuable space on the floor. The Triton woodrack is a simple design that makes good sense. By mounting it on an unused masonry wall, I was able to not only free up valuable space, but organize my stock for easy storage and access. The racks are extremely simple to construct and mount. My only beef is that the mounting instructions are limited and mounting hardware is not included. I did not have shipping issues that others have spoken about. If you've got a woodshop, this is an inexpensive ""must have."""
2,"Poor Packaging, Great Product","Like a lot of the others here who have had this shipped directly to them only to find it damaged upon arrival, I too recieved damaged goods due to poor product packaging.Amazon tried to make it right by sending me another one, but it too arrived damaged. The parts are not packaged securely. It may (or may not) arrive with all the parts, but it will arrive beat up. None of the parts are individually wrapped, so you can just imagine the scrapping and banging around this product will get while in shipping.On a postive note, it is durable, easy to use, and built to last."
3,Would Be MUCH Better If It Were Adjustable,"Prior shipping problems resolved by double boxing. Uprights spaced at 4' or more was too much for me, so I purchased two woodracks and installed the 4 uprights 32"" on center. Product works well enough, but something with adjustable supports would be a LOT better. Also, if you don't scratch the painted parts removing them from box, you most certainly will sliding the supports onto the uprights during installation.Hard to understand why others have rated this product so highly. I couldn't decide between 2 or 3 stars, but this product will do the job so 3 stars it is."
2,packaging definitely needs work,"I received this item and the box looked, like it was a return item fromsomeone else that did not like the item and returned it, then it was shipped to me. But it was a brand new item. I feel the same way as others that reviewed this item, in that it should be put into another box to be shipped.I think there would be a lot less missing pieces from the box that way.As there is heavy tubeing that slides around in the box and brake the taped edges of box and things goes missing. I was missing 4 shelfs, contacted amazon and they will be sending a replacement wood rack. So will see if this one goes any better. As for the wood rack itself, I have heard good coments about the rack and from what I seen before I had to send the partial shipment back, it looked like a very sturdy rack. So, if you can get all the pieces in one try you will like this rack, but it is like gambleing, you have to take a chance. Good luck."
1,Horrible packaging,Product is good but packaging is so horrible the product was damaged on arrival. Pieces were missing and I would almost swear I just bought some returned item.
3,Dissapointed,"I ordered this rack because everything I had seen previously mentioned these were made in Australia, well the package arrived & low & behold they are now being made in communist China! I havent had time to install them but they appear ""OK"" & will do the job. I didnt experience any of the shipping damage issues others mentioned. One thing to note no mounting hardware is included nor do the weak instructions mention the size required, this isnt really a big deal for those who know what theyre doing but the manufacturer should at a minimum advise what hardware will be needed for the basic mounting scenarios IMNSHO."
5,SE Asia Stranger Than Fiction,"Every vet has ""war stories"" to tell, and Kregg has put together a fine collection of unique first-person experiences from Vietnam. Reading this book brings to the reader a full spectrum of emotions as Jorgenson shares some truly unique narratives from that conflict. Some of the stories are hysterically funny, some are heartbreaking , and a couple are downright scary.It's a good read, and I'm looking forward to the next volume."
4,No Blood and Guts,"These are not war stories, per se. Rather, (mostly) interesting recounts of experiences that range from hilarious to amazing to paranormal. A quick read that's worth the time."
3,Very Crazy GI,"My husband is enjoying the book so far. Definite recommend for those who were there and for others who want some funny, but cold hard truths about Vietnam."
3,Some interesting stories about Vietnam.,"Even though I gave this book three stars, I very much enjoyed the read about the Vietnam War. Jorgenson has a sense of humor about him and it shows in his writing. These are some interesting stories about the Vietnam War as related to the author. I found myself laughing at some of these. Most were very interesting. Whether all these stories were true or not, it was a nice little read.If one wants to read some light stories about a very terrible war, this is a nice read. If you are looking for a more historical account, read elsewhere."
2,Not Very Interesting,"My title says it all, this book is not very interesting. Some of the stories left you wondering why they were included. I was expecting to read inspiring stories of heroism on the battlefield. A few of them were, but many were just recounting duty station details. All the people who served are to be respected and thanked for their sacrifices, but the title of this book leads you to expect much more than what it delivers."
5,A great book for singles and couples,"Another wonderful cookbook by Joanne Stepaniak. This was our first vegan cookbook. Every single recipe we have prepared out of this book has been easy and delicious. The recipes in this book generally are setup to make two servings, thus the name, but doubling and tripling them works fine too. Great gravies, biscuits, muffins, cookies, entrees, yummm. Plus tons of useful information for beginning and veteran vegan cooks. Everything you need in a cookbook in a small concise package."
5,Great for small families!,"I have many of Jo's books, but use this one the most lately, now that it's just the 2 of us at home. The recipes are simple, use ingredients I always have on hand, but most of all, are *very* tasty and delicious. I bought a second copy and gave it to my son to take to college with him, that's how great these recipes are!I recommend this for any vegan single or couple."
3,Fair,This book was fair. It did not really have a lot of recipes that were that helpful. I was a bit disappointed.
4,"Great item, one minor issue...","I bought the pink panty in small, and it was what I thought it would be. The fabric is fairly thin, but since I was buying silk for its breath-ability, that wasn't an issue and adds to the sexy nature of a somewhat basic item. One thing I wasn't thrilled about was the ""inner silk gusset"" leaves a seam in a somewhat awkward place (if you are offended by anatomically correct words, please stop reading now!) The seam is in just the spot to rest against the vulva, and since most panties I've come across incorporate a crotch that does not leave a seam on this sensitive area, I was surprised by the placement. It didn't seem to be too much of an issue for me, but I can see someone finding it literally irritating."
5,silk underwear,"This is the best thing to ever be produced. They keep you cooler and more comfortable than anything I've worn to date. Silk has it all over cotton. Yes, it's more expensive but worth every penny."
4,cute but small,love the watch but it was smaller than i thought it would be - the picture of the bear is great but the face is smaller than i had hoped - still kept the watch and will wear it
3,Missing Map,"This is meant to be a true facsimile of the original, but it does not include the map which was printed separately and was part of the book. I reported this but it resulted in another copy of vol 2 being send but still no map. Then an attempt to charge me again for the second copy which I did not want. Apart from that this is a facinating account of life in Sarawak during the James Brooke era, which was not otherwise available for purchase."
3,Silent and still birds,"I had been looking for a mobile for quite a while that was simple, bright and well-made so i went ahead and spent the 40plus dollars on the haba twitterling mobile.The pros: As others have said the birds are magnetic so they pop off for play. It is simple and bright.The cons: The squeaking on one of the two birds that squeak broke about 3weeks after we got it, only having used it maybe 15 times? The mobile really does need moving air in the room to work or it just..sits there.Overall it's okay and my daughter does like it when its moving. I'm just glad I didn't pay more for it than I did."
5,"Wonderful mobile, with a twist.","I got this mobile for my 5 month old daughter. She loves it!So do I. The balance of the two rods is easily adjusted by sliding the orange balls, the height of each rod can be adjusted by sliding them up and down on the strings, and the height of the ""sun"" on the top string can also be adjusted.Two of the birds have squeakers in them (press to squeak) and all five are magnetically attached. This allows for them to be placed on any of the mobile's five strings, right-side-up or up-side-down, and even allows them to be stacked together.The birds aren't small enough to be a chocking hazard, though, so they're safe for my girl to play with.And... made in Germany (with stringent child-safety laws), not China.All in all, well worth the price. I'm going to get her the Flutterflies mobile from Haba, next."
5,"Colorful, fun and versatile mobile","This is my go-to gift for friends who have new babies. We received this mobile, and hung it over our kitchen table when my son was younger. The birds have magnets in them, and when you swing them around, they bounce. It provided a lot of entertainment for little eyes. The birds can be easily removed from the mobile (by magnet, again) and some squeak. Once my son was past the mobile stage, we moved the birds to the fridge, where at 2 1/2 he still plays with them."
5,Awesome Speaker!,"I figured this would be a nice speaker, but it has far exceeded my expectations. Sound is clear and precise and can overpower your front speakers if they aren't up to the task. It perfectly matches my grey and silver Hitachi TV as well."
5,Classic quality,"Mr. Schryer basically said it all with his review, so I offer my words only to underscore his main point: Maag's interpretations of these works are among the finest ever recorded. I bought this CD for the outstanding Hebrides overture; every other recording of the Hebrides I've ever heard falls several miles short of this one. It was pleasant (but not surprising) when the rest of the CD dazzled me the same way. This is orchestral playing from one of the golden ages of symphony orchestras, with a level of quality that's hard to find anymore. The sound is balanced between all instrument families (a surprising rarity nowadays), and the polish and brilliance of the orchestra combines with Maag's true gift for interpreting Mendelssohn to produce a truly classic recording. This recording *defines* ""polished performances."" If you're looking for the definitive interpretation of any or all of these works, you're going to find it here, the same way I did."
2,Timpani barely audible,"All the instruments of the orchestra are important and should be heard, including the timpani. In these recordings, for the most part, the very important timpani parts are entirely or almost inaudible. Mendelssohn surely did not intend this to be the case. I am sorry to say that I cannot recommend these recordings."
3,Nice cuffs but not as pictured,"Cuffs are comfortable yet durable. The picture shows two D-rings with a spring-loaded metal clip. However, the actual cuffs I received had a D-ring on one cuff with the metal clip attached to the other. I'm kind of disappointed about this, but they seem nice enough."
4,A study of Woolf is incomplete without her letters,"Virginia Woolf is an author of myriad voices. The letters in Congenial Spirits are selections from Woolf's letters that provide insight to what Woolf thought and felt as she wrote. If you think that you know Woolf from blurbs in anthologies or from her novels, I recommend that you spend some time with her letters and her diaries. You will discover that Woolf is much more complex than the simplistic ""stream of consciosness"" moniker often applied to her."
3,Great mix of music though OK performance,"Rimsky - Korsakov is one of the greats of Russian music who composed works for multiple genres such as ballets, operas, symphonies, overtures, concertos, etc. This two-disc set provides a good compilation of many of these works without resorting to the common method of taking 3 - 4 minute samples from multiple works that embody the most famous tunes from said works. Instead, the album includes multiple works in whole such as Scheherazade, the Tale of Tsar Saltan, Snow Maiden Suite, and The Russian Easter Festival Overture. The result is two discs with over an hour of music per disc. However, many of the works are quite unknown, and can require some patience to listen through and appreciate.The orchestration and sound quality is only alright. For example, this album's performance of the Russian Easter Festival Overture was sub-par compared to what I have heard in other albums. Overall, a good buy, but not a great buy."
2,Wow..,"Quite possibly one of the worst Scheherazade's I have ever heard from a ""professional"" orchestra. There is some REALLY BAD playing on here. I still can't believe that a recording would be put out where the playing can sound completely incompetent at times. I really don't understand that. This is NOT a good recording!! Just the fact that there are so many noticeable mistakes proves that. If you are a musician, this should bother you and make you wince.Do yourself a favor and buy a different recording, either Bernstein with New York, Temirkanov with New York, or Maazel with Cleveland, or Concertgebouw or Philly. Any other recording will definitely be of better quality."
4,This Is More Like It,"Why don't I hear this on the radio? It is much better than most of the junk on country radio. Way to go, Ashley."
5,Terrific album,"Very tight, beautiful interpretations. These guys can really play, but they show each other respect and give plenty of space. With four guitars, there are tons of ways to get things wrong. These guys don't - and they do it with elegance. Check out their cover of Inesquecivel, the Paulinho da Viola choro classic."
1,Did not get what I ordered,"The toy shown is not what I received. Since it was a Christmas present for a disabled child, it did not make for a happy Christmas at my house!"
4,Monster Rally,"By 1966, the start of the third season, Irwin Allen was also working on the second season of Lost in Space and the fisrt season of Time Tunnel. This man only has so many ideas in his head to spread around. All these shows suffered in the later seasons but you ain't seen nothin' yet. Wait until season four. David Hedison said at a recent convention that if Rihcard Basehart and he had known what course the show would take, they never would have signed on. But once you sign on that dotted line, you're in for the duration"
3,Voyage packaging,"The content of the DVDs is fine, but what I do NOT like is the change in packaging! All the other volumes had cardboard sleeves, with thin DVD boxes. THIS time, and probably Season 4, Volume 2, we have a standard plastic 3-DVD holding case-so much for a complete, consistant collection."
3,"More of the same, but...","It's ironic how the budget for the VTTBOTS DVD's project was reduced at this fourth and last season. Ironic because it's just like what happened to the original series, back in the 60's when it was produced. Today,from the first to the third season on DVD, there were individual boxes for each disc and the whole thing was wrapped into another nice cardboard box. At this last season now, they put 3 discs in an only single plastic box and all the information about the episodes were printed in the back of the front cover. Really sad... And what about David Hedison's interwiews? It should be called ""The One-Minute-Commentaries"". Why not interview more actors of the series instead of putting a re-cut edition of the pilot episode? All we really have are the episodes themselves with quality. Forget about the rest, because there is none. Yes, it's more of the same, I know, but it could be much better."
4,Lost in space under the water,"I have been collecting voyage to the bottom of the sea for three years now. This season seems ( I have not seen them all) to be better. I remember watching this when I was seven years old on Sunday evening and during lunch time on Monday we kids would discuss what happen. It seemed to be more exciting back then. Probably due to the fact all of the sci-fi stuff was new. Now I look at it and I realize I collect for nostalgia. It is not a bad series but it is not something to brag about. If you watch closely you can see alot of special effect mistakes. You can see people holding props etc. All in all it is a good series to collect. However, not as good as star trek!BrianIn cleveland,Ohio."
1,Why only half a season in each set?,"What is this 'volume 1' and 'volume 2' nonsense? By the time you've bought vol 1 and vol 2 to get a complete season, these are some of the most expensive boxed sets around. For a forty year old not very good tv show? Are they kidding?You can get Stargate SG1 seasons (a FULL SEASON) for twenty bucks on sale. This is ridiculous."
3,"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Season 4, vol 1","I have to admit, I still like this volume of that great, though weird, 60's sci fi. What's not to like with something that has Richard Basehart & David Hedison in it? The only problem I had with this volume is that the episodes were not very memorable. Oh, there were moments that came off very well and a few really good episodes, like The Man of a Thousand Faces and A Time to Die, but not as many as in the previous three years. I will eventually get the last volume of the series, but only because I want a complete set and I have to have my Basehart, Hedison, Dowdell fixes."
5,What a pleasure to discover them again !,"It is really a great happiness to watch all those gems, I first saw in my youth, more than 40 years ago. Good actors, and when we could thing that the special effects are a little bit dated, the whole set keeps all his charm !My 4 years old son, Henry, is already a fan of Admiral NELSON !"
3,silly fun that is very enjoyable but....,"This like season two of lost in space was the time when a serious show went into the land of silliness, although it's alot of fun and fast moving the whole concept of the show was scrapped for this more kid friendly romp that could be said to be the fantasy season part one. I like this but after the first two seasons I just wanted the noncamp era back. That being said this camp era is a blast if you just enjoy it like that."
5,Good old times!,"Today we are flooded with hitech stuff but..depending on your age...remembering episodes of this show is quite a feeling as well...!, I used to watch it religiousely each week when I was much younger. Just to say that thrills is not only a question of generations but the memory still remain. Never thought I could get back these episode on DVD. Baby Boomers FANS...buy these!Thanks!"
4,Review of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea-Season Three-Volume One,"Much has been made of the significant changes that ""Voyage"" underwent in Season 3. Many would say that the show""jumped the shark"" (to borrow another TV show term) in Season 3. While this is definitively the case in laterin the season, as exemplified by Volume Two of Season 3, which contains all sorts of werewolves, outer space aliens,and the like, this is not necessarily the case in Volume One of Season 3. Volume One primarily contains episodesthat are very similar to the episodes found in Season 1 and Season 2. There are some episodes that containmore of the ""Sci-Fi"" bent that mark later episodes, such as the ""The Plant Man"", ""The Terrible Toys"", and ""Werewolf"" (yes there is one werewolf episode in Volume One). However, many of the episodesstill retain the Cold War era feel that marked the first two years of the program. All in all, still a lot of funto watch with the family."
5,Worth the wait!!!!!!,Great quality video and sound.I was waiting for a long time for this dvd and it lived up to it.!!!
3,Unhypeful,Eve Levine might have been one of the best magical practitioners while she was alive...but the adventures in this novel were slightly boring and unexciting. Really expected more from it.
4,Not the best to say the least,"While I'm a huge fan of Kelley Armstrong's books, I was more than disappointed with this book in the series. It seemed that you really never got to khow the main character Eve in any sort of depth whatsoever. It usually takes me about a day to read Ms. Armstrong's books, but this one took me about a week. I gave it 4 stars for one reason and one reason alone and that was because it had a very strong ending and I like the author, but other than that I was very disappointed. I was easily distracted from this book and it took till the ending to actually capture my attention.."
2,Forced myself to finish it,"I have enjoyed the Women of the Otherworld series thus far. I read them as quickly as I can so I can pass them off to our nanny, who is also a big fan. However, this book was a chore to read. The ideas were so far fetched and bizarre. Child ghosts being raised by ghost parents who couldn't conceive? Ghost hockey leagues? Magic being used in the afterlife? I realize that it's a bit contradictory to love books about werewolves, witches and vampires and call this far fetched, but it was just so hard to do much more than roll my eyes and trudge through.I would have skipped it if I weren't concerned I'd miss something from the other story lines. This was just such a disappointment from an author I have been very impressed with. I have moved on to Broken and am already back in love again, though."
3,Armstrong can do better than this novel.,"Having loved Bitten and Stolen, liked Industrial Magic and Dime Store Magic, I looked forward to reading Haunted.Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I found this story less interesting and less focused than Armstrong's previous novels. The idea of Eve Levine is interesting, but obviously not compelling enough to carry an entire novel. Eve's total self-absorption is off-putting in the extreme (*supposedly* she's not obsessed with controlling the living world, just concerned about Savanna). Armstrong makes the argument that Eve can't be as evil/morally bankrupt as everyone believes because Eve loved and protected her daughter. That argument is specious and unconvincing given that even arguably evil people, like Hitler, often love and protect their families.Kelley Armstrong can do better than Haunted, which is merely a uninteresting story with minor flashes of humor."
3,3 rating but only because of who the author is,"I really did not like this book. I tried for over a week to get involved in it and finally gave up. Haunted did not have anything that caught at me and compelled me to read to the end like the first two books in the series. I could not even develop a liking for Eve. I loved Stolen and Bitten and have read both several times. Dime Store and Industrial were ""good"" but in no way measured up to the first two books. I was really looking forward to reading Haunted, but ended up very disappointed. I'm not giving up on the author though, Kelley Armstrong is a wonderful gifted writer and I hope her next book (Elena and Clay - finally - yeah!)will bring her back on top. So I'm not suggesting to not read Haunted - just prepare yourself that it isn't as good as her others."
1,Gross-- Skip this one,"OK, I love Kelley Armstrong. I love all her books. I read them as soon as they come out. She's amazing. This book sucked though. The content was just really much more gruesome than her other books, and that is saying a lot. I also don't appreciate child molestation in my romance novels. It just turns the stomach. I read this book one time, then put it on th shelf. I read her other books 6 or 7 times. I am never going to be desperate enough to read this one again. Seriously, you could skip it and not miss much, and be free of some awful mental images.Fair warning."
3,only okay,"I am an avid Kelley Armstrong fan but this was not one of my favorites. I didn't feel like I got to know Eve - or care about her - as I have many of the characters in her other books. There were some good scenes but they were interspersed with too many scenes meant to give us background information. I found myself checking too many times to see how many pages I had left to read so I could finally be done with the book. Haunted was good enough to want to know how it ends, but not good enough to really get excited about it."
2,What Happened!?!,"I grabbed this book the moment it hit the shelves. I've read the other books in series and enjoy the unique attitude towards magic and the super natural. Kelley Armstrong has recreated witches and werewolves. But her view of the afterlife - ugh I felt like I was in Beetlejuice all over again. Its slow to start, pulls you through the afterlife as if you jaunting around Disneyworld (complete with pirate village and haunted mansion). Come on, for a woman who has written Bitten and Dime Store Magic this was a huge let down.I would have loved to spend more time with the character Nix and the archangels but instead got dragged around with a reformed bad girl. Boring.Lets hope Armstrong sharpens her claws for the next book."
4,Haunted,"This book was not quite up to my expectations after reading the previous books in this series. It is well written, but seems to lack somthing the other books had. I hope the next one will be better organized. Kelley Armstrong is a very good writer and going back to the characters from her first book may keep her on track."
5,Witches rush in...where angels fear to tread...,"And for good reason. The Angels sent by the Fates to recover the escaped Nix have not fared so well.Still, Eve Levine is up for the job. This Nix has partnered with some of the most ruthless serial murderers of all time and now she's after the people Eve herself cares about.Eve's playing a high-stakes game with her present life in the afterlife and the people still alive that she cares about in the balance. In my opinion, this is the best of Kelley Armstrong's series so far, a genuine page turner. ""Haunted"" is both well-plotted with interesting characters you can get involved with."
1,Redesigned? I hope so!!!,"Like many reviewers of prior RotoZip spiral saws, mine was a complete failure nearly right out of the box. The fan began to make a horrendous noise, and the interference had a very noticeable affect on the RPM. Before long, the spindle lock completely fell apart. In order to finish my small drywall job, I had to insert a dull bit into the spidle lock hole to change bits. The button completely fell off the unit. I understand that this tool is apparently redesigned to address these glaring flaws, but I absolutely would not buy one until the reviews turn positive. I opted to bypass the warranty process, and instead just throw this trash out. I've since purchased a Makita and so far so good.Just to be clear, I did not buy this exact model, but rather a prior saw, and although this model may be perfect, my goal with this review is to advise you to wait until the fixes are proven."
4,Commando Mengele is lots of fun,"""Angel of Death"", also known as its better title, ""Commando Mengele"" is a European exploitation movie in which a group of people discover a mysterious German living in a castle in Paraguay may be the infamous Dr. Jofel Mengele. Something sinister is going on in the castle, which is heavily guarded by men who don't hesitate to kill anyone who gets too close. One of the writers of the movie is Jess Franco and many of his regular actors appear. Mengele is played by Howard Vernon and among the good guys are Antonio Mayans and Jack Taylor. Mengele's henchman is an American mercenery played by Christopher Mitchum.The movie is pure exploitation and not very well directed by Andrea Bianchi (best known forBurial Ground - Night of Terror), but it's a lot of fun and should please most fans of European trash cinema."
3,"Good, but not great","I purchased the Brenthaven Edge II a little over two months ago. As promised, the case provides excellent protection for my laptop and is small enough to fit inside another bag. The only negative (although for me it is a big one) is that you cannot fit the power cord in the sleeve. I had anticipated using it in conjunction with a second bag, but I had hoped on occasion to be able to use it alone. That isn't a realistic option when you can't bring a power source."
3,OK....,"Great protection for my new mac, but it does not hold anything else..... no adapter, no mouse...nothing thicker than a piece of paper...."
3,"Good case but too tight for the new 15"" powerbook","Excellent bag. I ordered this bag with my new 15"" powerbook, the one with aluminum unibody enclosure. It seems that this newer version of powerbook is slightly larger and it won't fit in this case. You can make it work but not without a struggle.This is perfect for the previous generation of Powerbooks but I wouldn't recommend it for the current model."
4,"Simple, Light, Great","Really slick. Bought for my wife.Nice tight fit for Macbook or similar.Not much room for extras like mouse or power cord, but they can be squeezed in there if necessary.Has held up really well over the 2+ years we've had it."
5,best macbook pro case available,"I bought this case several years ago, and have traveled with it all across the country, in and out of airports. I love that the sides are firm, and the edges are also padded. When you carry a $2k laptop with your entire livelyhood in it, you had better be sure you can rely on a case to protect your computer.I have bought brenthaven's newer cases for my ipad, and my wifes smaller laptop, not as impressed as with this one. Alhtough they may be slightly more stylish, this one fits into a larger messenger bag and has kept my laptop safe for years.Go for this one -"
3,"great for a 15"" laptop and NOTHING else","The laptop sits great between the pillows that hold it tight, The corners are hard and can hold bumps. But if you want to carry the power cable of your Mac or the smallest mouse, neither will fit."
3,It's decent,"It fits the 15.4"" Macbook Pro snugly.The pocket on the back is a little small but it is possible to fit some of the laptop accessories in it.The power adapter ""attachment"" for the bag is ridiculously overpriced."
2,"Big deal, a handle for my laptop.","This is a nice case for your laptop, and only your laptop. You can't fit anything else in it. It would make sense to at least fit the power cord. I never use it and had to get another case to suit my needs."
2,flimsy!,"It hasn't broken yet, but it is going to eventually. I'm 5'10"" 180lbs and these things barely support me and don't provide a stable grip. These would be fine for a smaller woman, but thats really it- the PVC construction isn't adequate, I thoguht they were metal when i bought htem but was obviously mistaken."
3,No complaints.,Though the plastic seems cheap and maybe even a little weakly built I've also had no problem when using them. I weigh 150 pounds by the way.
3,"Ok, but not well-padded","This are made of a rigid plastic, and seem a little undersized for their intended purpose. The padding isn't thick enough for comfort and whatever you gain by saving your wrists, you lose in the pain in your palms. The plastic footie end caps that actually touch the floor are loose and will rotate freely; sometimes they will come off during heavy use.These may work for someone who carries a smaller frame than my 6'3"" 220, but I will eventually have to replace these with something better."
2,Flimsy,A little too light and the padding is insufficient. Spend more for a heavier steady product that doesn't hurt your hands
3,Will Get The Job Done,"The GoFit Push-Up Bars will do the job that you need them to do. Do not expect anything beyond that, as the price will indicate that to you. The reason for a 3 star rating is because it is such a simple device. If you plan on doing push-ups at home, I would recommend them because they will reduce the stress on your wrists. I am 6'7 and 250lbs. they hold me just fine and I really apprecaite them for the stress they relieve in my wrists. Snatch 'em up before their gone at this price. I just started the P90x which is why I bought these bars."
2,on the fence,"[Good]These do give you deeper pushupsAfter 3 months of use, they still work fine; though it should be noted that I'm under 180 lbs.They are comfortable for most push ups except one type.[Bad]There's a tendency for this product to fall on its side. You should get something that doesn't flip."
3,Just OK...nothing special,"These definitely aren't the worst things I've ever bought, but they're far from the best. In the product's defense, nowhere does it make a claim these are made of metal, but from the lustrous shine in the photo, they certainly appear to be. In actuality, they're made of plastic, HDPE(I think) to be specific, i.e. the same type of plastic used to make 5 gallon buckets. Don't get me wrong, they're functional, but I'm about 170 and they noticeably flex when I'm using them. I guess I don't really care, but for someone who takes their push-ups seriously(I don't), and likes to work with stiff equipment, look elsewhere."
3,Great design but plastic. Small diameter. Needs extra pads.,"Excellent design, but plastic, so they lack rigidity: they flex and move, and I weigh under 200 lbs. Tube diameter is too narrow, so they cut into palms, and I routinely push weights and ride bicycle. Padding sleeves are the most wear-out prone parts, yet extras are not included. I would eagerly pay more for fatter aluminum tubes with better padding and extra sleeves."
1,Was not stated if it was metal or plastic,I thought they were metal and it was not stated when I bought them. I never ended up using but I was not informed they were plastic so....
4,cheap and work great!,We are doing the P90X program and weren't sure which push up bars to purchase. These bars were cheap so we didn't know what to expect but they work GREAT! The bars take the pressure off of your wrists. They do slide a little on the carpet so I'd recommend using them on a flat surface instead. They are made of plastic but have an easy grip in the middle and have rubber around the ends to keep them in place on the floor. They come in the box as pieces but it takes about 15 seconds to assemble them and they are a tight fit.
4,"Light, study and good value for the $","I was happy with this purchase. I have only had them for about 2 weeks now, so I can't comment on their longevity. These bars are made of plastic, but there is no issue with stability. I am 6'1"" and 185 lbs and these bars work great for me. They can be dis-assembled and packed for travel, if need be. I believe doing push-ups this way is much better than palms on the floor. This is a good product for the price, IMO."
4,push-up bars,"This is a basic, but good product. Essentially, it is a hardened molded plastic with foam pieces over the grips where your hands will be placed. If you have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, or CTS symptoms, this will certainly help with your push-up routine while minimizing the chance of exacerbating any wrist related pathology. For the price, you can't go wrong."
4,Great little push-up bars,"They're lightweight and durable, just kinda sucks that they're seem/feel cheap but... they get the job done. Never had an issue with these in the couple years I've owned them."
2,Not enough grip cushion,"This set will get you through a workout but if you plan on using push-up bars regularly, you'll want sturdier construction and more cushion in the grip. The body is a lightweight plastic and the foam grips are uncomfortably thin, prone to tearing with frequent use. I'm replacing these with Perfect Pushup V2."
4,Product as described,Product arrived very much on time.Worth for the money spent. Recommend it if you are lazy to hit the GYM.
3,Okay,"They're okay, especially for the price, and they are sturdy enough, but I find that they really hurt my hands when I use them. I have to wrap thick towels around the actual grips otherwise it just kills my hands. As a result, I find that I'm not using them as much. Other than that, they serve their purpose and I like using these to do pushups much better than doing them on the ground. Good for the price, too."
5,"Great bars, great value","Great pushup bars at a reasonable price. They function as advertised. Although made of plastic, they feel supporting and are easy to grip."
3,Not Bad - could be better!,The handles need more foam cushioning and the base can sometimes wobble when doing wide arm push ups. Otherwise they are lightweight and breakdown nicely for travel.
5,"GoFit, fits my life.","When I first started browsing for push-up bars I expected the price to be out there, but I was startled to find that it was at a rather affordable price, I am impressed with these push-up bars, i've used them everyday since they were delivered, really simple assembly, and really sturdy as well. they're gentle to sensative wrists, * best of all - due to the size and mobility of this item it's perfect for people who's live their lifes on the go* for those who arn't really sure of the difference between using these and doing push-ups; with these you can feel the burn of your muscles building, where-as with regular push-ups odds are you just feel, the burning out of your body. I would reccomend this item to anyone."
4,Holds up pretty well,This product works really well. I had doubts that it would not hold my body but it does.
4,Excellent workout,"These bars are a great addition to my workouts. They provide a much better range of motion, and I don't have problems with them trying to slide across the carpet like my hands used to"
5,"Light, plastic - and perfect","These do exactly what they should. I would just do regular press-ups but find that these cause wrist pain.They are light, plastic, cheap (so can be lost without upset), can be very easily pulled apart for transport and put back together again. I bring them with me on my work travels so can at least do some exercise even if my hotel doesn't have a gym.They don't come with any instructions for exercises, but you can of course use them for more than press-ups.I'm glad I bought them, and would recommend them to anyone who gets pain in the their wrists when doing press-ups."
5,cheap and durable,I found these to be great for the price. The strength was surprizing. At times I thought I would test them to see if they could handle my weight in various styles of pushups. And I am convinced these cant be broke.
3,Plastic!,"Product is plastic and I weigh 250, it's scary to do pushups on these, but I guess you get what you pay for."
5,"simple, light, sturdy","What can i say. Easy to put together, simple, very light but very sturdy. made of light plastic but somehow very sturdy. didn't roll on me ever with even wide pushups. does what it should. 'nuff said."
3,Does the job,"These are about all you can expect for the price. The put together very easily, and they seem to stay together just fine. However, only a week after I got them, the foam in the handles began to rip off. This can be somewhat painful after a lot of pushups."
4,Decent Product,"good Product. the base could be wider for sturdiness, but still gives you full range of motion during pushups."
5,Outstanding Fitness Accessory,"I love the bars because they are lightweight, come apart for easy packing in my small travel bag for when I'm on the road and then go together within seconds. They allow me to have a great upper body workout while also targeting the abs. I simply vary the spacing and I can attack different parts of my arms & pecs. These were a great value and I'm buying a second set so I can keep one set in my travel bag."
3,"Good value, may be better out there...","These are a good value for the money and should do the trick to improve your workouts. They really help take the strain off the wrists and are easy to put together and take apart for travel. However, I also own the Valeo ones and they are much better as far as sturdiness and are slightly angled toward the ground, allowing for more comfortable movement."
3,Great value for the price,"These are plastic in construction and may seem fragile but I have not had any problems. They are suprisingly sturdy and do not shake when I use them.They squeak a little, but a dab of oil took care of it. I'm 5 10, 205lb and they are great in targeting the pectorals with a wide arm positioning with the handles perpendicular to your body and the triceps when bringing them close to the body and the bars parallel to the body.They are not high enough for dips.For the price a good buy."
2,ok,I dont see any benefit to using this over just your hands I tried it twice hurts more maybe it's doing something
4,It is what it si,"This is exactly what I expected. I did not want to invest in any expensive version not knowing if they would really make a difference. These work perfect for what they are intended for. They are cheaply made with pvc plastic, but do what they are intended well."
4,Pretty Good!,They were pretty good but I didn't think they would be plastic but metal. Its allright thou I still can use them and they still are as strong as metal.
3,Instructions for assembly misleading,"The instructions for assembling the table included a diagram that proved to be clearly and unequivocally incorrect. I attempted to follow the instructions, and in the process lost two pieces in pre-bored holes from which these pieces could not be retrieved. As a result I had to purchase these items from a hardware store, causing considerable annoyance and frustration. Once assembled, the table looks nice."
4,Nice quality for the price,Santa and I crossed our fingers when we invested in this wig and beard. It was wonderful. We were able to style the mustache and wig just right. Good fit.
3,OK wig and beard for the money,"I bought this wig and beard because I quickly needed to complete a Santa outfit for a charity function and couldn't spend a lot of money. My gallant husband, who was Santa, wore it for several hours on two occasions and his main complaint was that it itched. Other than that, it looked fine and did the job. I plan to get a better, more expensive set for next year, but this set would be fine for the occasional short term user."
1,"tasteless, waste of money","If you like dates, don't buy these. The Pod People made these things. Almost completely tasteless, and with a cardboard aftertaste. Terrible!"
5,Wonderful new CD,"This exceptional CD provides a unique blend of Pop Rock, Light Jazz melodies, and mellow vocalizations along with superb and meaningful lyrics.My 15 year old daughter listened to the CD once and now treats it as one of her favorites."
5,"Rustic, authentic bluegrass","If you're sick and tired of new ""bluegrass"" and yearn for that old-time mournful sound before bluegrass bands started sounding more and more like super-polished boy bands, this is for you. I am very selective about bluegrass. I like it rustic. I like it dark and troubled. Too bad this album is priced so high. It's worth it, though. There were weeks at a time when this was all I would listen to. It's good to drink to, by yourself, with friends, with that girl you're courting, driving through the country, the highway, the woods."
5,Hard Times Bluegrass with a jagged edge,"This is not gospel bluegrass. It's more like biker gang bluegrass. These guys capture the essence of blues and lay it down in passionate and pure hardcore bluegrass. If you like Steve Earl's ""The Mountain"" CD then you will love The Earl Brothers."
1,WRONG PART NUMBERS,PART # 84436M IS NOT FOR A 1 1/2-INCH BULL NOSE THIS PART # IS FOR A 1/2-INCH BULL NOSE
5,IDIOMATIC FRENCH OPERA PRODUCTION FROM CANADA,"I absolutely love this recording because of the idiomatic and precise enunciation of most of the leads and the gorgeous acoustics of the Church of Ste. Eustache near Montreal.For all of the virtues of the recently-released version by Colin Davis, this recording still wears its age VERY well and the conducting of Charles Dutoit is superb and has a certain Berliozian ""swagger"".In conclusion, add this version to the others you may own and you will not be disappointed. I very highly recommend this Montreal Symphony Orchestra version under the inspired conducting of Dutoit and the excellent choral contribution by Ewan Edwards and his superb chorus.Timothy Wingate from Ottawa Canada"
2,Can't be compared to Davis's two sets,"Both in terms of casting and musical performance, this recording cannot be compared to the 2 sets conducted by Colin Davis. The vocal performances here are often unidiomatic and most of the singers are at a loss in respect of the French style. It's an efficient performance, but Berlioz's music deserves more than just an efficient traversal. 2 stars."
4,I agree,"If you want to listen to Les Troyens, the set to get is the 1969 Davis set. Forget the 2001 set, it's too stripped of its drama. The 1969 set is the best ever!!"
1,horrible,"though i was not found of this book, at all, i will continue to read this series, just as i have done since i was 8 (that's 11 years of being a loyal fan!). you can still find some of my reviews from years ago on the earlier books. i was saddened to hear this series will be ending soon. even poorly written books like this are close to my heart."
2,Off topic book,This book was completely unecessary to the series. And enough with the crappy covers! What does Stearling have on her head??? A Halter with an extra cheek piece and a bit??? Does the artist really think that horses walk around all day in their pastures with bits in their mouth? You'd figure theyd research this or something before they tried to draw it!
3,Where is TB going?,"I love this series, and I hate to know they are about to end, to the dismay of all the loyal fans who have stuck with TB even when it went downhill. I do not want the series to end-but I do want background chracters like Lyssa and Kaitlyn to stop getting books of there own, though this book finally dealt with girls who fall out of love with horses and boys that don't fit in with the horse world. It was a book on REAL issues that REAL people actually face- not as unrealistic as the others. But still, this book is too far off the regular plot line of the series- books like this should stop, and new racing chracters, like Allie, should be introduced."
5,Oustanding!,"This book is outstanding and it blessed my heart and soul! The Holy Spirit truly used Bishop Evans to write Healed Without Scars! I am a bias reader and to read something from an author I know nothing about (especially inspirational literature) is out of my norm but I am glad I did. I happen to see him on the Paula White show one morning before taking my daughter to school and he spoke with such an anointing. When he talked about his book the title and cover moved me and I had to read it. My grandmother gave it to me as a gift and that was the best gift anyone could have given me at that time! I found myself in this book and I found the answers to my prayers out of this book!! It is a must read...I promise you, you will be blessed and it will change your life as it heals your heart!"
4,Fun but not a blast,"This game takes a bit of time getting used to, but it can be quite fun. I am a fan of Tetris, but since it's not available on PSP, Lumines was the closest thing to it. I don't like the music the game tries to tout, but no big deal....I commute to work by train everyday, an hour each way, and this game is a good time-killer."
3,Pretty Fun and passes time but no tetris,This game is pretty fun... and I find myself playing it during lunch breaks and trying to get better at it. The better I get the more fun it is. But the more I play it the more I miss tetris and feel like something is missing in this game.Great graphics and cool music effects though
3,"Perforated, need to trim 'em","These are ok, nice cardstock, but the bookmarks are perforated and you need to tear them apart, and at that point they are unsatisfyingly bumpy along the edges. This can be remedied by trimming, which I did with a paper cutter. Once that is done, all is well. As long as you know this, go ahead and buy."
2,not what I was expecting,"I didn't like the fact that the bookmarks needed to be torn out of the book, made for uneven edges"
3,Yep they are bookmarks,"Well they fit the bill...which was to allow me to get free shipping. Now we also have 12 bookmarks. They are just cardstock type paper, printed on one side, borders not very even."
1,"Zero, I didn't even like the artwork","There is nothing good to say here...The artwork is bad for starters.There are 2 bookmarks per page and they are tear apart. I don't think that this is acceptable for a bookmark.Plus, they are kind of short for a bookmark (only 5 3/4 inches, I should have paid more attention when ordering).The list price is $1.50, so not a bargain here. It is currently on a 4 for 3 deal which helps if you like ugly, short, tear apart bookmarks..."
5,"Great book, different from board book","I originally came across the board book in a store and bought it because I remember reading this book as a child. I thought I was losing my memory when I remembered pages that weren't in the board book. I looked it up on Amazon, and quickly found that the board book was a condensed version of this, the regular version. I went ahead and ordered this version-- and I love it. The cadence of the book makes it really fun to read aloud to my little kids, and the pictures are bright and engaging. We have a ton of books, but this one is one of our favorites."
5,Exciting!!,New adventure series for young people. Adults will enjoy also.Good Luck to James and Paula.
5,This really is the Definitive Guide,"This book is great. Hard to believe from a nutrition book, but this one becomes a pager turner. Once I started reading about all the great benefits of flax, I just wanted to find out about everything it has to offer. This book is full of great research, but you don't have to be a doctor to read it.The best part is, once you decide to started using flax, there are a bunch of great recipes right at your fingertips. I've tried several of the salad dressings and so far I love them all."
1,Shonky and short weight.,"This shonky production gives a new dimension to the term 'exploitation'. The DVD cover lists the running time as 85 minutes. It isn't. The total running time of the disc is 73 mins. To compound the deceit the running time of the story, such as it is, is a mere 59 mins. The balance of the time is taken up with a 14 min credit crawl. That's longer than the credit crawls for Ben-Hur and The Ten Commandments combined. It's painfully slow and is plainly done for the sole purpose of padding out the disc. Don't waste your time looking for the director's commentary and Behind The Scenes mentioned on the cover. They're nowhere to be found. A complete disgrace."
2,"Horrible Tripe, and I like these kind of movies......","When I ordered this off amazon, I was hoping that the film would be as good as those ""guilty pleasure"" late night Cinemax films that I so enjoy watching. But this film was truly pitiful. I was hoping for some good looking girls, and what I got were some unatractive strippers that seemed like they didn't read the (horrible) script. I was hoping that Nikki would save the film, but she was pulling off some weird back-flip, stunt-man stripping! Like I said, I usaully love films that have beutiful naked girls doing naughty things, but this, is not that! Take my advice and subsribe to Cinemax!"
3,Cheesy adult entertainment,"This movie is a typical sex movie. Good plot, weak acting, but overall fun. Good for bachelor's parties or similar events."
3,"Affordable, but a little weak",The fact that these brakes are a little weak didn't affect the purpose I bought them for. My wife is tiny and doesn't need much to stop her bike.
4,Speakers did not fit the opening which had to be enlarged.,"Speakers did not fit the opening, which had to be enlarged. The speakers worked great after the box remodel. The speaker description dimensions should have included the required size of the opening. Shipped very quickly (3 days)."
5,The Title is Perfect-- It Says It All...,"Carefully, attentively, w o r d b y w o r d, read the title of Mark Bosco's ""The Complete Independent Movie Marketing Handbook- Promote, Distribute, and Sell Your Film or Video"". It says it all. Trust me: trust it.Implement even a few of the suggestions in Bosco's book, and you'll save ten times, maybe a hundred times what the book cost you, and give your film a fighting chance to prosper. 'Wish I'd had this earlier."
1,Is it the translation?,"I simply could not push through the turgid prose to get any sense of danger, life, urgency, or fear. Especially annoying is the author's decision to write about himself while kidnapped -- in the cellar -- in the third person, while returning to the first person for all things outside the cellar. It really distances the event. Apart from that, his story is filled with lots of philosophical ruminations on what he chooses to describe and what he was thinking. I found it very easy to lose interest in what he was saying and, sorry to say, I just gave up about a quarter of the way into the book. I guess I'm just not intellectual enough for this kind of stuff. It kind of seemed like the translator just did a straight word-for word translation. It seemed very Germanic and creaky, with little flow or ease. I felt like I was wading thorugh a thesaurus...for no purpose."
5,Amazing quality,"The amount of information contained in this two-disc set is phenomenal. With the menu system on the DVD, it is very easy to select the portion of the program you wish to study, which is very helpful when looking to practice or reference a specific technique.Disc One contains three courses. Together the courses demonstrate many joint locks starting from a push hand scenario.Disc Two contains two programs. The first contains 10 techniques specifically for countering an opponent who is controlling your elbow in pushing hands. The remainder of the disk is a bonus program that consists of a catalog of over 80 taiji chin na techniques. There is no instruction in this portion, just the demonstration of techniques in slow motion and regular speed."
3,feng shui,"The book is really for beginners to feng shui. I think I've read at least 25 books on the subject over the years (pretty obsessive) and cannot say I gleened any new information from this material. As I said, maybe this is a good one to start out with."
5,The best travel account in history,"This book is the travel accounts of Ibn Battuta a Moroccan traveler from 14th. century A.D. who traveled from Morocco to China bassing by North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Arabia, Iran, Byzantine empire, South East Asia(During his travel he was appointed as a supreme judge in Delhy(India) and in Maldive islands(His journey lasted for more than 20 years). He also visited Spain, and West Africa. At the end he went back to Morocco and dictated his travel accounts to the script of the Sultan Anan al-Marini of Morocco."
4,Effective Look At Islam's Science And Travel,"Ibn Battuta may have been the single greatest traveler of premodern times. In this book, Dunn is able to not only illustrate the qualities of Battuta, but also the complex intricacies of the inertcommunicating zone of the Islamic empire. It also effectively highlites the threads and interwoven cultural changes that are superceded by the Islamic faith, which allowed a traveler such as Battuta to accomplish his great feats. This may be the most detailed and creatively displayed work in existence which describes the 13th century Islamic world, and is a synoptic introduction to the post-Crusade period."
5,A great read,"I started reading the Rihla but got lost very quickly in the lingo, strange names, customs and happenings. This book is immensely helpful and a fantastic read as well, you can hardly put it down. Feels like a magic guided tour in the Medieval Orient. It was an eye opener, shedding light on how biased we are towards a distorted western perspective on history. If you are even slightly interested in Medieval times, exotic travelogues, Sufism or Islam in general, this is the book for you."
1,Horrible,I hated this book. It is a long and boring story with no action. I do not recommend this book unless you are a history buff or are forced to read it.
1,...,"this book ...it is very long and boringand u can't read it in a week if u tryedand there are no cliff notes on itso if u are getting it for a class, don'teven bother wasting your money becausethere is no way that u will read this book"
5,Great memory book,I absolutly love this one. Not only does it give me extra places for pictures but I can add my own scrapbook pages to it as well.
2,"not really a ""new approach""","This book does outline American's health issues quite well. I also believe it does give a nice balance of each issue. Where it loses its objectivity is how to solve the issues. There is nothing new there. Ban vending machines from school, Twinkie tax, etc. The only ""new"" solutions to me is to tax R rated movies, and prevent fast food restaurants from opening up on every street corner. For some reason they believe taxing us to death is a good idea. Despite what the authors say, they are trying to create a nanny state."
5,Ow!,"The ""flinch factor"" in this book is unusually high. There are moments in the story many men have been through at one time or another, and I don't think any of us really wanted to know what was going on in the mind of the other person present.I loved it and can hardly wait for Voluntary Madness to come out!"
2,Stay Away!,"This recording only conveys the ""loud drama"" of Monteverdi's Vespers, which it is soley not. There is not one ounce of spirituality in this recording whatsoever! Not only that but, the recording is marked with blocky chunks which are heavily noticible (as cuts)...there is no sense of fluidity or flow at all. Also, there is no libretto included.I wouldn't recommend this set of the Vespers to anyone starting out and wanting to understand them. I would recommend Gardiner's second recording in it's stead as it is imbued with spiritual elements.I've heard that Andrew Parrot's version is the ""one"" to get, though I've not heard it yet."
3,Economical Monteverdi,"At the bargain price this is perhaps a good buy, and there are those who are fond of this version. It is clear, and well sung and played. For myself, I feel that it has difficulty getting off the ground. The recorded sound is excellent."
3,"Footprints of the Gods, Graham Hancock","If you are interested in the connections between Egyptian and South American pyramids, this points out some interesting clues.The first half of the book has too many descriptions of the personal travel routes and transportation methods of the author and partner but Part IV is worth keeping this book on the shelf. It gives references to worldwide examples of the Noah's Ark and other other common legends from pre-history that speak of an ancient advanced civilization before our recorded history."
5,excellent; even tho huge it flies by,"This book foolows up on and reinforces books like ""Chariots of the Gods"" and is an excellent and effortless read for those interested in subjects like forbidden history and archeology or UFOs. Highly recommended: even though it's huge it seemed to fly by."
3,"Movie: ""Smash Up"" and ""Tulsa""","The movie, ""Tulsa"" was not worth seeing; however, Susan Hayward was the only good thing the movie presented. ""Smash Up"" was much better and dealt with alcoholism with the full recovery when she nearly lost her child in a fire, her fault. Susan Hayward, as usual, presented a solid performance. She was always excellent in her films and ""Smash Up"" shows it."
5,the oklahoma kid,"enjoyable, cagney, bogart,together as cowboys, but still shooting guns. seniors would have fun viewing this movie.djkay"
3,Bogart as a Cowboy?,"Cagney and Bogart as Cowboys is something to behold. Bogart was right Cagney does look like a Mushroom. If you saw the movie in the late thirties,it was fun, however it does'nt hold up that well into the nineties."
3,"Essentially, a gangster film in a western setting","I like The Oklahoma Kid, mainly because it features 2 of my favorite actors, Cagney and Bogart. It's also an entertaining B-Western picture from Warner Brothers. Don't expect anything profound. Bogart is not nearly as good as he is the John Huston's 1948 masterpeice, Treasure of the Sierra Madre. James Cagney is not nearly as good as he is in Raoul Walsh's 1949 masterpeice, White Heat. However, The Oklahoma Kid is a fun western film, one of my favorite guilty pleasures. A good way to kill 80 minutes. Check it out. ***1/2 (of *****), too bad Amazon doesn't use half-star intervals, huh?"
3,The Oklahoma Kid,I bought this VHS tape for a very good price. Although it was a used product it was in very good condition. I purchased it for my parents who enjoyed it. They said it was more melodramatic than they remembered yet it was still good considering the time it was made in.
5,Fun and Easy,Both my girls enjoy this train set. It's easy for them to set up and take apart on their own. They use all the pieces and even add some of their LEGO buildings to create little villages. It's well constructed and durable.
3,Classic '80s Made for TV Movie,"I saw this movie when I was a youngster in the 80s and it has forever stuck with me. I think it was more the cool idea of time travel and what would happen when present (at the time) clashed with the past. I love when Sir Boss teaches Guinevere and her ladies in waiting karate. The depiction of the evil ""Merlin"" is quite a twist on societies current sentiment towards the ""wizard."" This isn't what I'd call a 5 star production, not is it 100% historically accurate, but honestly, I love seeing Rudy Huxtable trying to explain what a train, hot air balloon, and a bicycle are to medieval folk!"
1,The man from Houston is right!,"Amazon says it's unrated. The DVD case says it's the ""Director's Cut - Running Time App. 85 Minutes"". Even the disk itself says ""Director's Cut"". That director must be Edward Scissorhands. This film had a run time of 71 minutes. It was a tragedy to see such a work of art destroyed and cut beyond belief. I will not be doing business with Shadow Entertainment again. I have the REAL unrated version taped off of Cinemax. I guess I'll just burn it to DVD myself."
4,EXCLLENT SOFT CORE EROTICA,"Landon Hall is an exceptionally beautiful woman and her talents are highlighted in this film. She has very hot lesbian scene with another woman.The movie also has a performance ny Taylor St. Claire, a hardcore porno queen.I could do without Dutch Flaherty though"
1,Yawn,"I thought this was dreadful. Simulated sex (badly), simulated breasts (VERY badly - you can frequently SEE the silicone bags wrinkle) and far too much plot for this kind of movie. And if you're doing a soft-core porn movie, why do a plot about a couple that DOESN'T have sex? Surrender cinema has done far better work than this."
3,Adequate soft core opera,"The cut versions of this movie have gone out of print. This is an adequate entry for the Surrender Cinema series about a stressed out couple that checks into haunted Hotel Exotica to explore wild fantasies. Gary Graver did the photography, his work is almost always good and Nikki Fritz has a small part."
2,Do you REALLY want a plot?,"Let's face it, if you're looking for a movie with a plot, you're in the wrong area. We're buying Surrender Videos for one reason: the women. Don't get me wrong, the women in this movie are pretty hot (as usual), but besides the ""kitchen scene"" involving two babes, there just isn't much to this one. Trust me, if you want to see the Surrender girls at their best, try the ""Femalien"" series, ""Virtual Encounters 2"", or ""The Exotic Time Machine""."
2,Answer to DVD Situation,"Here's the definitive word on the DVD version...Koch got it wrong, plain and simple. The box both lists the runtime at 85 min. and the fact that it is supposed to be the Director's Cut. It isn't...it's the edited 71 min. version. I've never seen the VHS version, but you probably want to check that one out rather than the DVD."
1,Hotel Exotica For Her,"When Ellen Evans directed this movie she managed to get sex scenes with energy, passion, sensuality, and creativity. Fans of softcore know how rare these things can be. An just how skilled a director has to be to accomplish them. Which make the directors cut of this movie (Which is being sold here) such a mystery. My only guess is that when she was given the chance to reedit this film she wanted a to make a version that she could watch with her 14 year old daughter, or maybe she was trying to get a job at the Hallmark Channel. What ever the reason if you are a fan of the Oxygen Network buy the Directors Cut, if you are fan of softcore get the original version."
1,Do not buy this DVD,"I bought this supposed to be UNRATED version of this movie from ""mediathrill"" and I felt that they cheated. They have cut all good scenes from this movie. I contacted them and they just denied their responsibility. I had seen this movie earlier, so I was very much aware of all the scenes.Please do not buy this DVD...no matter what."
1,Wrong DVD.,"After numerous emails to Koch Entertainment and Shadow Entertainment they admit it is the wrong version of the film, but I cannot get an answer as to what to do about it. Neither company appears to want to answer further emails. I have been robbed."
1,BEWARE- Director's Cut not the Uncut Version!!!,Waste of time and money.This is the woefully short and BORING version of teh movie.Don't bother with this - this should not have been advertised as the Unrated Version...
1,UNRATED DIRECTORS CUT????!!!!!!!!!!!,I Can't believe I purchased this worthless DVD. I have the VHS version(R-Rated Version) that I purchased A few years ago.And when I found out that the unrated version was coming out on DVDI thought to myself YES... this is the version that I've been waiting for because Cinemax doesn't doesn't show that movie anymore.WHAT THE %$@#!!!!! It's the same cut up version that I already have on VHS !!!!!! Consumers BEWARE!!!
1,"Very, very disappointing. This is NOT the unrated version.","I was looking forward to finally seeing Hotel Exotica and was very happy when I heard about this DVD release from Shadow Entertainment. I was very disappointed when I got the DVD, started watching it, and quickly realized that Shadow did not get the unrated version of the film, but the edited, R rated version. The back of the DVD case says it runs 85 minutes and is the director's cut. It only runs 71 minutes.So how bad is the content? There's supposed to be this scorching lesbian scene between Ahmo Hight and Taylor St. Clair, but here is what you get on the DVD. Ahmo and Taylor are in the kitchen and start smiling at each other. Then there's an extreme closeup of the two of them licking an ice cube for about 10 seconds... and that's it. And what I just described is typical of all the sex scenes.I definitely do not recommend this one."
1,"BEWARE: This is the Director's Cut, NOT the Uncut version!","This is the woefully short and boring director's cut of the version.Do not be fooled, this is NOT the Uncut Version!Save your Money."
2,"2 men lovers was not an issue, the doormat named Cat was","This book is actually a well written book. I went back and forth on the rating because the story line was entertaining, I liked the characters, there were many funny lines but ultimately the kiss of death the H betraying the h and getting off so easily. How he tried to make it up fit well with the story and was cute but as a reader it simply was not enough. It turned a well written book into an annoying cliche. When oh WHEN are authors going to understand that readers do not like pushover h? When developing characters, authors, don't forget the backbones!There is also a 2 a gay relationship subplot in this book. It didn't bother me at all but if that would offend you then this book isn't for you. Personally, I was more offended by the abrupt resolution than anything else."
3,Mixed feelings about this book,"When I first started reading this book, I thought it was wonderful, I loved the characters, but near the end when Lukedid something, I hated him and wondered why the author would do this to a character. I was actually hoping Cat wouldn't forgive him and there would be no happy ending.This was my first Dallas Sculze book and my last. Not interested in books when I lay awake afterwards thinking of ways to nueter the guy."
3,Good reading,"I enjoyed this title, my only problem was Cat's (the main female character) age. So as not to step on anyones tender toes, I will just say I would have preferred she be portrayed as about a decade older since that is how she behaved. I am in my mid-30's and enjoy reading about characters around my own age."
4,"I have to disagree, I LIKED IT!","I have to disagree with Disappointing's review. I liked the book very much. The fact that there was a subplot involving the relationship between the two male best friends certainly did not ruin the book for me. There was so much more to the book. Dallas Schulze delivers, once again, an enjoyable, touching romance with engaging characters. I look forward to her next publication!"
2,2 stars for the beginning effort,"When I first started reading this book, I thought it was pretty good. But as the book started developing more, specifically the secondary characters which was the somewhat detailed relationship between two MEN, I was completely turned off by the whole thing. I agree with another reviewer, this book belongs in the trash."
1,disappointing,"I have not read a Dallas Shulze book in a while, so I was pleased to find a title I haven't read before. The book starts off well. The main characters are funny, the plot line engaging. But, about half way through the book the main characters best friends, both male, start a relationship. From there on I was turned off by the book. I skimmed to the end to find out how the main characters ended up. The next morning I threw the book in the trash. It is definately not a re-read."
3,Warman's Sports Memorabilia,One thing that is not immediately obvious is the year published.I was a little dissappointed that the information I was given did not include the fact that it was a 2000 issue and not 2001.Carole
2,Disappointing at the very least!,"This comes from an avid admirer and owner of her previous releases: ""Let them Eat Cheese Cake"", ""Second Slice"" and now ""Cheese Chronicles, 1"". Olivia's best work was already published several years earlier. Although this book is chronicled on the beautiful model Rhonda Ridley over the past 10 years, it doesn't do her justice with this ""out takes"" version of works that didn't make the cut for Olivia's first two books. Save your $ and get the quality Olivia herself wanted us to have...her original series."
3,deja vu vocal sound,"Dont judge a book by its cover.This piercing green eyed siren can really sing. As the cd was playing I was trying to figure out who her voice reminded me of. Half way through it hit me,she sounds just like Annie Lennox of eurythmics fame. The music more mellow.My pix:Stars,Feel Free,Legs,and Solitude is my Teacher."
2,Post-its not included,"It states ""Flag dispenser value pack with removable and repositionable assorted color flags and clear desktop dispenser."" in the description, however it is only the dispenser.Why 2 stars? Good product, but pricey especially since it doesn't include the post-it's which it says it includes. Not a fan of false advertising..."
4,Beautiful Book,This book was the text for a wine class I took. It has gorgeous photos and is quite comprehensive for a great price.
4,comprehensive,"Exploring Wine is superbly written with a very natural flow. Overall, it covers all aspects of the industry with minor holes such as the coverage of Swiss wines, truly lacking. Perhaps the authors neglected to spend sufficient time on minor players but it behooves them to fill these holes for the next update. To summarize, you will not be disappointed withthis compendium!"
2,Not worth the money & Outdated,This book is grossly outdated with regard to up and coming wine regions. A boring and lazy take on wine.
1,Waste of money,"I received and watched this last night. The archival footage shown I have seen before and it is an VERY incomplete document of the band's history. Only Neil Murray, Tony, Ozzy, and Geezer are interviewed. The band's history goes up to Sabbath, Bloody, Sabbath, then skips Sabotage and Never Say Die, then briefly mentions Heaven and Hell. A shoddy job. I returned my copy."
1,JUNK,"BRACKETS ARE JUNK, 2 OF THE 4 DON'T WORK LIKE INSTRUCTIONS CLAIM. BAR IS NOT MARK AS INSTRUCTED. MOUNTING BRACKETS AS INSTRUCTED STOPS USER FROM EVER CLOSING DOOR ITS MOUNTED ON...DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY ON THIS CHINA MADE RIPE OFF PIECE OF JUNK"
2,Really Hard To Free the Bar From the Clamps,"I was using it as a chin-up bar (hung high in the doorway) and for doing a variation of dips (hanging low in the doorway). It was very, very difficult to free the bar from one set of clamps so I could place the bar in the other set of clamps. On most occasions I actually had to use a baseball bat to knock the darn thing free of either set of supports so I move it to the other set of drilled-in supports on the door."
2,awful!,"didn't even hold my weight. was probably the worst investment on amazon to date. i'm not a big guy, i weigh less that 180. would never purchase again."
2,chinning bar,The bar fit into its door holders so tightly that finally my husband had to buy a hacksaw and remove the safety latches that locked the bar into place. Not helped that the screws included were too long and part of the problem where the bar found itself locked into the door frame.
3,Only for the Strong,"Got it, installed it using instructions and although the bar is stable and won't fall, the rod itself turns as you try and pull yourself up. So unless you have really strong fingers and wrists, good luck. I have a hard enough time trying to do a pull up. The last thing I need is the bar turning. We tightened it the best we could, and it still turns :-(. Based on the reviews, it looks like we're the only ones with this problem...Oh well :-(..."
1,Defective,"I basically payed for a metal bar. The product was defective, having only on piece of metal. This meant that it did not telescope and only stayed one size, about as wide as me. It was too small to fit in any doorframe, since the size was not adjustable.Do not get this product.I got a bar from Sport's Authority and it works fine. And if it breaks, I can always take it back unlike this bar."
4,"Great bar, cheap screws.",I'm impressed with the construction of the bar and it provide a good range of motion. My only complaint is the screws that came with this bar had cheap heads that rounded off when I first tried to screw it into my doorframe.
4,Wonderful exercise equipment,I have nothing to say besides the GoFit Chin-Up Bar is an excellent workout equipment because it allows you to work out otherwise unworkable muscle groups without membership at a gym. Combine these with a set of dumbells and you can hit virtually every muscle group desired. The only problem I had with it was that I have zero access to a powerdrill. But I believe it is safe to have the design require a powerdrill anyway.
1,new bars suck. read the dates of the reviews,"i did my research and read the reviews about this bar. i guess i should've looked at the dates of the reviews as well. the newer reviews complain about the new brackets that screw into the doorway. these are square brackets with tabs on the side and DO NOT fit in standard doorways. there are little tabs that are off to the side of the brackets that secure the bar and keeps it from spinning. these are great and all, but they suck if you want to close the door. do not buy this product if you want to close the door after you install it, heck, don't buy the product at all. try something else. the picture that is in the description is old and is not what you will receive."
5,Good Quality,"Purchased this for my home. Usage is for three children to do daily workouts.The fit and finish are great. The bar is well made. The chrome plating is of a good quality and the removable and repositionable Velcro pads work well without being too bulky.The mounting hardware included is sufficient to mount just about anywhere. Generally hardware included in products is inferior, however I used what was included and was pleasantly surprised. recommendedPros:Finish is niceHardware included works!Appears stable and safe after installCons: None"
2,Not what's pictured.,"Do not order this item, it's not the one in the picture. Others have already pointed out that now it comes with odd square brackets that do not properly fit door frames. After my first mounting, the bar was a nightmare to get in and out, as well as chewed up the back side of my door!I unmounted the brackets, and used a Dremel to cut away the pointless side spin pieces. I do not know why they are there? The bar is now much simpler to get in and out and you can close the door with out it being scraped up badly.I do not recommend this product. It can be made usable, but it should come usable."
1,Demand quality hardware,"I am so frustrated with this product's junk mounting screws. One screw head came off half way into my door and now it's there permanently. The other screw heads all stripped and I had to remove them with pliers and buy quality ones at the store. The actual bar is fine, but the installation hardware is junk, so buy it knowing you should go out and get your own screws to mount this in your door way. A sign of the times of the quality we are getting. Not a big deal, but frustrating when you expect to get something you can mount when you receive it. I am writing the company, not for a refund or anything, but to demand better quality, even if I have to pay a few more bucks for better screws it's worth it."
3,"Good concept, but not ideal in practice.",These fit between the door jambs pull up bars are a good concept for an economical way to get pull ups in your home exercise routine. However I find the conditions just too cramped to enjoy doing pull ups. It is much more fun and think easier to do pull ups if you are hanging with your feet off the ground and not worried your going to bang your head on a door jam. Unless you are very short (or your doors are very high) these bars are too low and you have to bend your knees to do the pull ups. Personally I don't like that as much and I find myself wishing I had bought a self standing pull up station.
1,Mounting Hardware - Read this!,"The mounting hardware is horribly designed! First, the mounting brackets are supposed to fit in the middle part of the door frame. These brackets were too wide for my standard door jam. Second - even if they were wide enough, the locks could stick out and block the door from closing. Third, the locks on the top of the mounting hardware is useless and causes extreme difficulty in removing the bar. Fourth, make sure to mount the bar at the top of your door lower than the instructions recommend - otherwise you will struggle removing the bar. Fifth, I ended up duct taping the locks on the mounting hardware in a vertical position to help the bar be more easily removed. I suggest you do not buy this products, but find a better bar. The grips are comfortable and the bar appears pretty sturdy. Installing this to actually work was a pain!"
4,good but cheap screws,I installed this bar and it works good. My only qualm is that the screws they send with it are the cheapest screws I have seen in a while. The screw had stripped before I had gotten it halfway into the door. After about 1/2 an hour I finally managed to get the screw in via plyers. Spend 50 cents at your local hardware store or else you may have a heck of a time getting the screws in without the option of taking them out.
4,Solid,"This does the job, although I'd prefer one that simply unscrewed/expanded to fix itself in place by pressure--I used to have one like that that worked great.The hanging brackets are ok, but a bit fussy with the lock-in tabs which supposedly keep the bar in place (although it's hard to imagine it popping out through the top as you're doing chin-ups).Definitely worth pairing with the P90X Chin-up Max - Pull up Assist Band, especially if you're not quite as strong as you think you are."
5,Function over form,"This chin up bar comes with great mounting brackets. The most important thing for a chin-up bar. They are hard to describe but let just say they are of the best variety.5 screw mounting hardware, screws included, then at the ends of the round bar are welded flat ends that slide into the the doorway-mounted slots.I weigh at least 200lbs and my doorway is weak, but this product fulfills the needs that I have. With ease.It also comes with a couple velcro secured pads to save your hands some blisters."
5,Great Value,"Bought this bar for my doorway hoping it would fit and support weight as advertised. For the price, I was a bit unsure of how it would perform, but I'm happy to say it works great. It comes with a bar that you can adjust the length of quite a bit, two brackets, and some screws which seemed short. Substituted some longer screws for the short ones and got it installed in a few minutes without issue. The bar is very strong as long as you install it with longer screws and the brackets and a fantastic value for the price."
2,Not worth $20,"Gets the job done but at the bare minimum....not worth $20. Tops I would pay upon seeing the quality and mount type would be about $10. It does, in fact, work properly, but so does a pipe you bolt to the wall. I expected something a little more refined."
4,Works as expected.,Mounted easily and seems secure. Seems the spot welds on the outer sleeve came loose and it now spins but doesn't affect the functionality so only took off one star.
2,I got a damaged one,"when it arrived, one of the ends was badly crushed. LOOKS like a quality product. we'll see once I fix it (too lazy to deal with returns)."
2,"Kind of like ""Free Credit Report""","The bar arrived today; which was all I was expecting. It came with an insert to go to their web site and they would provide free training routines. GREAT! All their web site does is try to sell you other products, including another chin up bar. They will send you, for a limited time, CDs with workout routines; but they want your credit card number for ""shipping and handling"". I got what I wanted; but I feel like now the company is trying to pick my pocket. Like the product; don't care for GoFit Company."
1,Extremely Unsafe,"This bar failed where the long bar meets the end circles that are welded to the bar - one of those metal pieces bent. I weigh 165 pounds. I had my knees pulled up at the time so when I fell, my head went through a sheetrock wall facing the doorway and I landed on my lower back - I even smashed my ankle. I am in terrible pain - my head is bleeding. EXTREMELY UNSAFE!!!"
1,Useless,"In college I had a chin-up bar that you twisted to tighten into a doorframe and I thought that's what this was as well. Turns out you need a drill (which I don't have) and you have to drill into your doorframe, which I can't do since I live in an apartment. What an absolute waste of money. If you live in a home and you own a drill, buy it, for the rest of us it's completely useless."
4,CHINUP BAR GR8,"ITS NICE N EASY TO INSTALL, GR8 PRODUCT FOR NICE PRICE GOT THE ITEM IN 3 DAYS OF ORDERING"
2,Must screw into wall,"This isn't the screw-to-lengthen type. One piece was loose inside the other. I'd intended to use mine without the door brackets (to avoid drilling into my doorframe), but that only works with the ones you screw out to set the length. So I returned mine."
3,Grebe,"The GoFit chin-up bar was shown and described as having four rectangular quick-release brackets. Instead my version has two circular brackets that look like the ends of a couple of small (albeit thick)cans. Ironically, in the customer images provided with the product three customers showed the rectangular brackets and one showed the circular brackets ... so I guess the product can arrive with either configuration. The bar was packaged well and arrived without apparent damage ... until I opened the box. There are two simple gap covers on each end of the bar that covers the gap between the narrower inner tubing and the larger diameter outer tubing. One of the two covers was broken off the bar and lying in two pieces in the box. The bar itself is sturdy, easy to adjust, and will serve my purpose just fine. I'd have given the rating an additional star if it weren't for the broken gap cover and confusion about which mounting brackets to expect inside the box."
2,Poor Design,"The design of the bracket that hangs the bar on the door frame is poor. First, it is difficult to slide the bar into the bracket. It has little tabs that are supposed to secure the bar, but they mostly make it very difficult to drop the bar into the bracket. Second, the bracket (especially with the tabs) is too wide for a standard door with a door jamb in the middle."
4,Measure how much mounting space you have first!,"This feels like it holds up pretty well. However, do measure how much space you have to install the brackets first. They're actually pretty wide, you'll need at least 2-3 inches to be safe (referring to the depth of your door frame). I had to improvise with a few extra screws because there wasn't enough flat area, so I'm a little icky on how well it will hold in the future. Overall, a solid product though, a good deal for the price."
2,meh,"Requires too many screws to install the mounts, making it pretty permanent. In the long run kind of destructive to the door it's installed to."
5,boys,"If you have a boy/s who need to get built up energy out of their body, this has proven to do just that for our boy. We love it..."
2,Beware,"I only had this for about 3 weeks and only used it 2-3 times a week. I was in the middle of doing pull-ups when I hear a loud pop and suddenly the bar spun around very quickly nearly throwing me to the floor. I was lucky enough to have gotten my feet down in time to catch myself otherwise I would have fallen back on the weights racked behind me. The bar broke free of the circle part that rests in the bracket on the thicker part where the pads are. Very disapointing to have a bar break that was practicly brand new. I e-mailed Go-Fit to voice my concern and never heard from them about the incident. It might have been a freak accident, but it was one that's made me nervous about trying Go-Fit out again."
2,Not what I Ordered,"The model pictured here looks nice, but the model I received has very annoying square shaped mounts that will not fit most door-frames. It's also very hard to get the bar in and out of the mounts. Does not work anywhere near as easily as the model picured here with the round mounts. Hope I'm the only one that had the ""switched-out"" product."
2,not going to work for me- pictures/reviews wrong,"This product has been updated so beware. 2 stars for misleading product page.While the improvements may benefit some, they will not work for me.I was purchasing this to use as a pot rack- hoping I could create significant tension to hold small amounts of weight without drilling into my rental's cabinets. The bar does NOT twist to adjust length- mine just slides in and out, requiring the brackets, which look hexagonal and not round anymore.I can also say that my tendency to use products for other purposes than originally intended has served me well- so please forgive me for demanding the pictures are of EXACTLY what I will be getting for $20.Now I have to decide whether it is even worth returning, gifting or what... and back to square one on my non marring pots/pans hanging bar."
4,"good product, late delivery",The delivery was a week later than what they promised at checkout but I was notified about the delay. The chinup bar is pretty good once you have it installed. It's great for working out. Feels sturdy.
2,Poorly Designed,"For a product that should be so simple, it's surprising how far this product misses the mark.The mounting brackets are the main source of its problems. The brackets do not mount completely vertically. The screws provided do not sit flush within the brackets. The retaining tabs unintentionally jam up. As a result of these three issues, it can be very difficult to place the pull up bar within the brackets, and even harder to remove the bar. I have repeatedly had to use a hammer and wood block to remove the bar. That is a serious flaw.A smaller gripe is that the two bar halves have a sliding relationship but no stopper, so, if you hold onto only one half, the other can easily slide out and nick your walls or floors.On the plus side, once you are able to get it all the way in place, the bar is quite sturdy and the grips are comfortable. Nevertheless, I would suggest buyers look elsewhere for a good pull up bar."
2,$20 for two pipes,"Okay, I think this product will safely hold my weight, but all it is are two pipes (one slightly larger) with hexagonal ends and 4 brackets. Probably cost next to nothing to manufacture. As other reviewers said, the bracket locks are a pain. Not much thought has gone into this product - half a mind to return it, but since I am half way installing the bar, I'll probably keep it."
4,Does the job with little expense.,"I started using this pull up bar a couple of weeks ago, it was easy to install and doesn't look terrible. The grips haven't slipped on me yet, but I can understand how they might. I'm not worried about whether or not it will support me, the only thing I've had to be careful of is getting blisters because I'm either at a desk all day or teaching at CI Bible College ([...]) (hence the reason I got a pull up bar for the home). Great product for the price!"
2,"sturdy bar, difficult to get out","The bar is sturdy and feels like it will hold up pretty good. Maybe there is a trick I just haven't found yet, but once the bar sets into the brackets I have a heck of a time getting it out. There's a locking system to keep the bar in that feels like its more complicated than it should be. I set the locks to face out like it says but I still can't get the bar out of the brackets without having to hit it really hard from underneath."
5,Love It,"The chin-up bar is great. the construction is well built. The only thing I can think of that would be a problem is if you lost the fabric peices that helps your grip because the bar itself is hard to hang on to, too slippery. I love this bar though. I use it for everything. I can do many exercises with it."
4,Nice bar; awkward installation.,"This bar works exactly as you'd want it to. It's fairly easy to install, but there's weird metal tabs on the brackets whose function isn't entirely clear. Are they supposed to help hold the bar in place? In any event, it's well worth the money and time to install in your bedroom door, especially if you're like me and hate going to gyms. My guns are huge."
4,solid--don't need to spend much money on this type of equipment!,"only issue i have relates to my door frame--probably not dense enough to manage. Also, not sure the push-up/floor level is necessary."
2,Chin-up bar,"Received the bar...appeared to be good quality. However, the brackets are too large for the inside of a normal (modern) doorway without removing the center trim-stop piece. I have looked into one other brand and found it to have the same problem. It's not a problem if you don't mind cutting away part of the door jamb to make space for the width of the brackets."
1,The product I got is different from it's told here,"I have chosen this breadmaker because it can make up to 3lbloaf, based on the information in this web site. Unfortunatelyafter I got it, the product can only make up to 2 lb loaf.I am so disappointed. But it's not easy to return it.What a spam! The money I spent is not worth it."
1,is it true?,"After having used the machine for a couple of times and noticed that indeed it makes perect loafs, I trusted it in the hands of my 17 year old (not smart?) who didn't put the paddle in right. So the machine had been shaking and rattling for some three hours by the time I came home and through the violent bumping of the stone hard dough inside the baking pan the coating had come off on some spots. Luckily I noticed the tiny strips of tefal hidden in the crust of a freshly made product. No big deal I thought I will buy a new baking pan. To my utter surprise it is no where to be found... I have bought an other breadmachine in stead but does anybody have a suggestion?"
2,2 bread pans in less than 2 years,"Purchased in Jan 2007, my second bread pan just failed, the gasket or rivets started leaking. I called and they said a replacement is not available...GRRR!!!!I have greatly enjoyed this model, it was my first. Easy to use and consistent results. I make 2 - 2lb loaves a week of a whole wheat bread.I going to limp along with it until I can save the money for the Zojirushi BBCC-X20."
5,I just forgot...,"This is target's specification that says it can make up to 3 lbs loaves. ON THE BOX it says only up to 2 lbs! Moreover, I do not see the 62 programs but only 12 and this is way enough, you will probably never get to use them all.Also, I bought it on Sept. 25th, and I got an electric bread knife with it (in the box), wondeful!"
3,Okay,"I got this as a wedding present in Jan-2007 and it lasted for about 4 years before it broke. I used it regularly 1-3 times a week. I found this machine was best for kneading dough. For baking bread, I found the crust was too thick for my preference. I have decided not to replace my bread-maker. I find my kitchenaid mixer works just as well for kneading dough."
2,Fantastic while it lasted,"I got this iron in August because I was tired of the crappy ones you can buy anywhere-they didn't last long, didn't do a decent job, and took FOREVER. For months, this iron worked GREAT. I was careful to take good care of it and it got my obnoxious, curly hair (bordering on afro) really straight. So what if i had to drop a few bucks, right? Well, today it stopped working. I used it in the morning and it was fine, but it was humid out and I'd been working out. So I turned it on to touch up my hair, and nothing happened. I've tried everything to make it work, and it just won't. I would get another one of these, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. I plan on doing more research before dropping a ton of money again."
4,more than expected...,"my wavy hair is extremely frizzy and very difficult to keep straight. i've used four flat irons; a remington wet2straight, a revlon, a conair infiniti, and another random conair. some of them left my hair frizzy and fried, despite the product i used to keep that from happening.i decided to take a chance and spend more money on a non-walmart flat iron, and i bought the hai stick ceramic iron. i got it in the mail today and tried it out. it usually takes me a half hour to straighten my hair, but i'm pretty sure it only took fifteen minutes. it heated up fairly quickly, and it didn't snag my hair or anything.the only issue is that my hair is still sort of frizzy, maybe it's just the summer humidity. it didn't take any moisture out of my hair, so i guess it's better to still have moisture and frizz than frizz and fried hair.all in all, my hair is straight and i'm satisfied. :) i'd definately recommend this product over ones that will fry your hair, it's worth the extra bucks."
4,Great Purchase!,Great product that makes my hair feel silky and soft. It also doesn't make my hair smell burnt like other flat irons.
1,Bad Quality,"I bought an even nicer version than this one for $120 at a store. I bought the Copper-T and had 2 stop working on me in the span of 7 months. The first only lasted 2.5 months. The third one I got through the warranty was not put together correctly and ripped out my hair. The warranty only lasts a year and the product will surely break down before then. I was told I could not have a refund because ""the store I bought it from is the company that took my money."" I have never been so frustrated with a company."
1,no communication!,"I would not have waited 2 weeks if someone had emailed and said this item is on backorder! this was supposed to be a gift! now I can't get another in time . my advice to this seller, drop a note I still would have cancelled the order which I did bur=t I may have purchased in the future which I won't now!"
1,Eek!,"I've used GHDs and even though they're pricier they are worth every penny. After using the Hai Stick just one time, I had terrible split ends, and the stick did not 'glide' over my hair in the same way but seemed to tear. Terrible! I think I'll upgrade!"
3,"Good, but...","This straightener is very good, but I did have an issue with it. After a month and a half it suddenly stopped working, which was extremely frustrating. I contacted the seller and their return policy states that you can't return defective products after 15 days. They told me I should contact HAI directly instead. After a looong process (approx 2 weeks) of trying to reach HAI and paying to ship the product to CA, I just received a new HAI straightener from the company itself today.Yes, HAI products are normally very good, but just be aware that it could be defective (as all things can be) and that this particular seller only has a 15 day return policy! (Wish I read that earlier)"
5,Ceramic Flat iron,"Always like this brand. Seems to work well , heats up fast. Nice travel size too. Had to replace the old one only because I stepped on it and broke it. Other wise it had been working for 6 years!"
4,Pretty Good,"This flat iron works really well but i'm african american and when it get's closer to the time that I need a perm, this doesn't seem to straigten the roots that well anymore- or it straightens it for the day then the roots get puffy the next day. But other than that, it does a WONDERFUL job on my hair and doesn't damage it (and I have fine hair- or hair that breaks easily)."
1,Do Not Buy This Item,The HAI Nu-Stik Flat Iron is a joke! It worked for 5 months and then quit! Good Luck getting results on the 1 year limited warranty.
4,Sun glass holder,"This product will perform as designed, preventing wayward sun glasses from finding their way into water ways, machinery or even on a roadway somewhere!!! I enjoyed roller coaster rides and more with mine, and am grateful someone made this wonderfully great item. Buy, enjoy and be happy!!!"
1,This record is insulting,All Paula sings about is chasing after thugs who treat her bad and how great it is to have an unemployed boyfriend with dandruff who ain't got nothing better to than sit around playing video games until 6 in the morning. It's almost like she's saying because a girl is poor the best she can have is a lazy and broke boyfriend who treats her bad so like it. That's rude!!
5,Amazing Debut!,"More people need to discover her. She has so much talent! Her songs are very good too! My favorite songs on the cd are Doing Too Much, Walk Away, Easy, When It Was Me, So Cold, Wanna Be With You, Make'Em Clap To This, and Footprints On My Heart. This cd is definitely worth your money!! Go out and buy it right now."
5,Excellent CD!,"This CD is very impressive for a girl her age. She has good vocals and her songs are really good.Doin' Too Much - 8/10 This song has a nice beat and good lyrics.Walk Away (Remember Me) - 10/10 ""Walk Away"" is a very catchy song!Easy - 9/10 Great song. One of my favorites.When It Was Me - 10/10 The perfect love song.Overloved - 8/10 This version is much better than the original, which was done (badly) by Raven Symone. Paula's new beat and better voice improved this song greatly.So Cold - 6/10 A good song, but not one of my favorites.Good Girl - 7/10 Catchy beat and great lyrics.Wanna Be With You - 8/10 The chorus is my favorite part.Make 'Em Clap to This - 8/10 An awesome dance song.Breathe - 9/10 I love this song. It is also one of my favorites.Let's Go Out Tonight - 6/10 An okay song. But it really has no point.I'll Be Down For You - 7/10 A good love song.Footprints on my Heart - 10/10 My favorite song on the CD! A marvelous track!"
4,Food for thought,"The story format made it easy to read. Having an infant makes it hard to read any book in a short amount of time, but I was able to finish it in a few days and had much to think about. I think the ideas presented are very timely. The concepts were presented very clearly, and made a lot of sense. I'm interested to see how my life changes as I impliment these concepts."
5,A Life-Changing Book,"This book offers a fresh approach to conflict resolution which applies equally to realtionships within families, in the work place or between racial groups. What it offers could have enormous value in so many areas. The thoughts are presented as a narrative which has the effect of illustrating the points made as well as adding human interest. I read the entire book in two sittings which is rare for me. This was because I was very aware that it was telling me something really important and I couldn't wait to read it. I was not disappointed."
1,Encouraging for those wanting peaceful relations,"This book reminds me of the encouraging command to ""bring every thought into the captivity of Christ"". Written in story form."
5,The Anatomy of Peace,This is a must sequel to Leadership and Self-Deception. These two books have been of the most influential books I have ever read.
5,A must read!,"This book and its companion piece, Leadership and Self-Deception, is required reading for all supervisors in our department. Not only has it helped shape our leadership styles, it has also aided us in becoming better people. The guidelines the book shares are strangely simple and sensible, and while it make no religious inferences, much of what it teaches are based on sound and proven biblical principles. It is a must-read for anyone who desire a better relationship with co-workers, subordinates, and superiors."
5,Reading this book would be a favor to yourself and everyone you know (and others besides),"I've read some very good books, but I cannot think of any other that can be as helpful, accessible and life-changing to as many people. I immediately ordered five other copies for people I know.The book is very readable, entertaining, clear, and practical as well as profound. It is hard to imagine anyone reading it and not be transformed by it. If it is in the curriculum of every school in the world, the world will be a much better place in just a few years."
5,Learn how your attitudes about yourself lead to conflict with others...,"This is a fantastic text which is easy to read and understand. It will teach you how to find out if you are living in a ""box"" of behavior or ideas that influences the way you treat other people. Read this book and pass along the info to everyone you know - we can learn how to make peace among us all..."
5,The Anatomy of Peace,"Do you have relationships that just don't work because of the behavior of ""that other person?"" Children who rebel? A spouse who is unlovable? A friend who is ornery?Here is a book that will change your thinking as you dixcover ideas like ""The Better-Than Box"" or ""The I Deserve Box."" It is told in an easy-to-read story format with Lou (who was also the main character in Leadership and Self-Deception) trying to figure out how to straighten out his son. Chapter titles like ""Choosing War"" or ""More Germ Warfare"" indicate the battle, and this book will give deep insight into resolutions and methods of victory."
5,A Must-Read!,"If you have EVER had a personal conflict with ANYONE, you need this book. It is an easy read and written in story-form but is EVER so informative on the psychology of interpersonal conflict. I couldn't put it down."
4,Peace,"The senario is pretty accurrate but kind of cheesy. It would be better with a real life story. The basis of the book is thought provoking, really seeing others as individuals."
5,Excellent,This book is excellent to help a person understand things about himself that could make trouble in relationships and teaching on how to look at others. It is based on Biblical principles.
3,good book,"This was very helpful in learning to control a bad temper. It also helps keep me calm, peaceful and happy."
5,The Anatomy of Piece - The Arbinger Institute,This book was really an eye opener - but at the same time recognizeable in its message.It inspired me to become a better listener and to a higher degree respecting other people's point of view in search for lasting solutions.
5,Even better,"I read Leadership and Self-Deception before and really appreciated the content. However, I think this book does an even better job of looking into how conflicts begin and how we can each play a role in bringing peace into our lives. The narrative style is really good and stands out as being actually helpful in understanding the concepts. It really has given me a whole new outlook on the world and tools to bring peace to my relationships. If you are thinking about reading this book, you should."
5,The Anatomy of Peace.,"This is an amazing book. there are so many things in life, that if we allow them, will put us at war in our souls. This book can help an individual look at life in a completely different way. The choices are ours, we can be at peace or at war. I an individual is struggling he or she should read this and begin the process of living in peace."
3,So so book.,The book takes 200 pages to say peace comes from loving people while Jesus says it all on the sermon on the mount.
3,review on peace book,"This is a great book. I bought this book after losing a loved one, going through a horrible breakup and having some hard times at work. This book has a good story line that keeps it understandable and realistic."
1,Disappointing,Unfortunately this book did not bring to light any innovative opinions or perspectives. I found it very one-dimensional and disappointing. I will be requesting a refund from Amazon.
1,Bad Sample,Books with lots of blurbsbut no sample of the writingmake me suspiciousI want to see a chapter or twoand the Table of Contents
4,Held My Interest Throughout,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The writing style and characters are fun, the story moved along quickly and you care about Chloe, the woman who ran out at her wedding. Definitely above average Chick Lit."
3,I really wanted to like this book,"Another chick lit book. The story of a girl who flees her wedding - and goes on to discover herself and what real love is.I really wanted to like this book. I liked the opening chapter, but just like this author's previous book, the storyline gets bogged down with way too many details.I prefer my chick list a little more breezy (it is, after all, chick lit) so- I prefer mine ""? la Bridget Jones"".Pass on this one."
2,Japancrap,"This album is garbage. I love Japancakes...Dallas, Sleepy Strange, Belmondo, even the Waking Hours. But this album is pure torpor. Yes, A.W. Sonic has it's moments...but nothing on this album shows the band at it's soporific, hypnotic best. Go for any of the aforementioned albums. (But Belmondo is bliss.)"
4,"Very pleasant to listen to, and very pleasant to make love to","This is not a bad collection of music - slow and jazzy. It's very pleasant to listen to, and very pleasant to make love to. Yeah, the tunes have a bit of a naughty undertone to them, which sets the tone for the collection. I recommend it!(Review of Music to Make Love By by various artists)"
1,delayed,After nearly a month im yet to get this product even after contacting the seller im yet to get a reply .Please i need amazon to help me track this order cos i need the material urgently
5,My 10 year old says it is awesome.,"I gave this book to my 10 year old son (a big fan of Garfield) and he says it's awesome. The book is paperback, black-and-white, and on a pretty gray paper, but the quality is good. He did not want the colored version saying that black-and-white is authentic. As for the cartoons themselves, they are a timeless classic, as good as usual."
5,"Jim Davis in ""The Zone"" while creating these three treasuries...","I'll make this short and sweet, your time is important.I've been reading Garfield comics for years. Treasury, after treasury, after treasury, friends...The 10th Fat Cat 3-Pack is about as hilarious as you're gonna find. From Start to Finish, it's simply one of the funniest.If you're new to Garfield THE Cat, of course the first 5 or 6 treasuries are a great place to start. It's usually a good idea to start from the beginning.But pick this one up soon after!! Jim Davis hits the ""hilarious"" bull's eye with almost every. single. strip.:) Thanks for reading, and HAVE FUN WITH THIS ONE!"
2,"How about retirement, Jim?","I thought the book was uncreative, exhausted of plot and, lastly, Garfield has become so one-dimensional. All in all, though, if you have a Garfield nostalgia that you can't just abandon, then you should, by all means, read this book."
4,Celine Dion Taking Chances,"This item, a DVD, arrived on time and in good condition; and at a reasonable cost. I haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but I am sure it will be accepable."
5,Breathtaking,From beginning to end it keeps you on the edge of your seat! An insightful and frightening journey into the world of spritual warfare that will leave you sleeping with the lights on. I'm an avid reader and never before has a book haunted my dreams like this one. Heisler is definately among the best! Can't wait for his next!
5,I'M A READER NOT A WRITER,"PLEASE FORGIVE MY WRITING BUT ALL I CAN SAY IS ""WOW"", I STARTED THIS BOOK DURING THE DAY AND WAS AFRAID TO GO DOWN THE BASEMENT! AS IT GOT DARKER SO DID MY IMAGINATION, SO I DIDN'T MOVE WITHOUT MY DOG BESIDE ME. I HAVEN'T BEEN AFRAID TO SLEEP WITHOUT A LIGHT ON SINCE THE ""EXORCIST"", BUT MY ELECTRIC BILL IS DOING DOUBLE TIME! I CANNOT WAIT FOR A SEQUEL, I'M HOPING THERE IS GOING TO BE ONE. I LOVE THE WRITERS STYLE AND I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE AN AUTHOR TO LOOK FOR ON THE BEST SELLERS LIST! GLAD I GOT THIS BOOK AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT, IT WAS VERY GOOD."
5,Better than Koonz!,"After reading the author's previous books, I wasn't ready for the nightmares that occured when I was able to put the book down. A non-stop thriller, so well written that the characters have great presence and stay in your memory. I enjoyed the book to the point, and talked about it enough, that my father is waiting to read my copy.I have a feeling Mr Heisler is going places. I can't wait to see what his mind can churn out next. I advise anyone who likes chills, thrills, and a lot of action to pick this book up!"
1,Sony handicam user,"Just bought a 50 pack of the Ridata mini dvd-r 4x, for my Sony Handicam. Very noticeable vibration with these disks, compared to a sony or fuji disk. I wonder if the disk is thinner or isn't as rigid as the other ones. Possibly out of round, but vusually can't tell. I tested one and it recorded fine and playback was normal on the computer, but for some reason a 2 minute video clip took 8 minutes to finalize, 2-3 times longer than other full 4x disks I've used. Vibration can't be good for the camcorder so I'm worried."
5,Wonderful for gamecube copies,"For backing up your GC disks, you need these and no other. They are not expensive and are even convenient for giving a friend a video from net or whatever."
5,They worked for me.,"I used these Mini DVDs in a DVD camcorder and they worked for me. I played the DVDs on my computer and on my DVD player/TV and they worked in both situations. However, an associate had trouble getting the same DVD to play on his computer. The images on the computer were superior to those on the TV."
2,Vibration Very Noticeable!,"There is a Definite Vibration while using these discs!!! I am like another reviewer and am worried about what is going to happen to my camera, if i continue to use these discs. I will be contacting the seller for a refund/return. The ONLY plus I give these is that you DO NOT have to Format the disc before using it, unlike many other NON Sony discs, on my Sony DVD308."
3,They work,I have used a little over half of the disks. One was bad and would not record. I use a Sony DCR-DVD108. These disk have to same issue as the Memorex I have used in the past which was a slight vibration when in use. They are not balanced correctly but are usabale and very economical.
1,Worst Ever,85% of the disk will not let you finalize with only 10minites of recording on them would never purchase this product or any other product from Ridata
3,Pretty Good,"I've found that though the Bach is excellent, the player, Peter Hurford, isn't as good as had hoped. I prefer the playing of Biggs and have found that the notes from the foot pedals are somewhat unempthsized. I have an excellent 5.1 audio system and the subwoooferr doesn't get the use as from other players. There is also a low, nearly sub-audible, rumble present on all the tracks, rather as though the music is being played on a poorly damped turntable. I know that this was was present on the master as the time between the tracks is quite silent. all in all, it is not as impressive as I had hoped, but not at all unpleasant."
4,Never a dull moment in this Bach recording.....,"Peter Hurford is perhaps one of the foremost organists of his time. He has not only studied music but law as well, giving a scholarly twist on his education. I have always been pleased by his interpretations of Bach. They are no-nonsense, with strict tempos, clean, accurate passages, and registrations which are very lush and vibrant. For the new fan of Bach, there is no better place to start, as this set contains all of the ""big"" organ pieces for which Bach became legendary, as well as a few well-known chorale preludes. For those who wish to explore Bach's organ contributions in more detail, buy Hurford's complete Bach recordings (Although I believe it is out of print or very hard to obtain, as I have not yet found one). If this is the case, buy Marie-Claire Alain's version on Erato. No two organists understand Bach better."
3,Lots of Bach organ.,"This album has a lot of music for the money. The recording quality is excellent, but I find that the playing of Peter Hurford, while clean, does not carry the rhythm and soul of some other recordings of this material by others. The music seems more stacato and less flowing than other renditions such as by E. Power Biggs."
3,Good for very general and basic information.,"This is not a good book if you want in-depth information on the subject of lighting. However, it does give a nice overview of the major areas of photographic lighting. Unfortunately, it leaves the reader wanting more information and further explanations. I felt this book was a good read for a novice photographer, but not someone who knows the basics, but wants a more in-depth view of the broader categories of lighting."
1,Don't waste your money,"I regret buying this. Its partly my fault for not reading more reviews. Its also partly the problem with buying on line. In a book store had I looked at this book I would have seen that is merely a lesson plan for teachers with out an idea. The book offers almost no information. Instead the premise is that the 'student' should go out and do the exercises. In other words, learn it by yourself.Perhaps if you are a teacher without an idea you could use this for lesson plans. The authors are an example of university teachers who publish garbage to appear to advance their status on campus. Otherwise this book is useless."
5,Nicely Done,"Tina was a friend of mine for years and we often talked about her writing a book of poetry. Her relationships with different people and her battle with cystic fibrosis are some of the things that inspired her to write her poems, and she had even shared some with Gloria Estefan when she met her. Tina is missed by those who knew her and love her still, and there are glimpses of Tina found in her words. I am glad to own a copy of her work, as I am proud to say we had been friends. Tina was a lover of animals and a supporter of gay and lesbian rights. I recommend this book to anyone who appreciates dark poetry."
4,Duck Amuck!,"Fuzzy Duck brings to mind Wishbone Ash; both are English bands mining similar musical territory...only the Duck gives it a little more oomph. Rather than WA's two-guitar attack, the Duck splits the heavy lifting between guitarist Grahame White and Hammond hitter Roy Sharland, but these tracks could have appeared on either of Wishbone's first two albums; it's that same uncertain (but highly enjoyable) blend of folk meets blues through a Marshall stack. As this is '71, you occasionally get a blast of heavy psychedelia as well ('Afternoon Out', 'Country Boy'), adding a splash of pepper sauce to an already pleasing stew. Probably best appreciated by people whose palates found Wishbone Ash okay, if a bit bland. Four bonus tracks, recorded after the album, with new guitarist Garth Watt-Roy spearheading a would-be Mark 2 lineup that never took. You can easily live without FUZZY DUCK, but should you decide to buy this cd, you won't feel robbed."
1,"Product is fine, seller is not","I purchased these spoons thinking they were dinner spoons. They are serving spoons. I tried repeatedly to return them and got no response from the seller. The spoons themselves are fine, just not the size I was looking for. As long as you don't have to return them, you'll like them."
4,An overlooked member of the Wailers,"Peter Tosh was the more political member of the original Wailers. On this release, he focused on the topical subjects of nuclear power struggle, *No Nuclear War* (this was released during the heights of STAR WARS) and political racism, *Fight Apartheid.* At a great price, you'll hear one of reggaes greatest. If you like this, try Honorary Citizen."
3,Hmmm,"I don't really think this CD was necessary. The only songs worth listening to are Mandy, Calling all Angels and Highway to No Where. The rest didnt really make any sence in their position on the soundtrack to Zoey 101. I don't like the show, and Jamie Spears should NOT be singing."
5,Monica Rocks,"CHICAS MALAS - TITLE TRACK IS A POP SOUNDING SONG NOT REALLY FAST BUT DANCEABLE, A PRETTY GOOD SONG.NO VOY A LOORAR - THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM, FAST DANCY, GREAT VOCALS, IT HAS IT ALL.DE QUE ME SIRVE YA - SLOW SONG WITH GREAT VOCALSNO PUEDO SEGUIR - AVERAGE PACED NICE SONGYO VIVO EN TI - ALSO AVERAGE PACED GREAT SONG WITH GREAT VOCALSLIBERAME - SLOW SONG NOT A GOOD ONEHOT LINE - GREAT FAST SING WITH A CHORAS OF CRUEL SUMMER BY BANANARAMA AND ACE OF BASE.LAGRIMAS DE ESCARCHA - ANOTHER SONG NOT TO BE MINDEDSACRAFICIO - SECOND SINGLE STARTS SLOW THEN GETS FAST A TYPICAL TRAIT FOR MONICA, GREAT SONGNO CAMBIES NUNCA - WRITTEN BY DIANE WARREN ( DOES SHE SPEAK SPANISH) A GREAT BALLAD. i MEAN FOR A SLOW SONG THIS IS AWESOMEAINT IT BETTER LIKE THIS - FAST PACES SONG IN ENGLISH TO BREAK TO ICE FOR HER CROSSOVER. SHE STARTED IN THE LAST ALBUM WITH IF YOU LEAVE ME NOW AND ENAMORADA. NOW SHE HAS THIS SONG AND SOON IN EUROPE AN ENGLISH ALBUM IN SEPTEMBER. HOPEFULLY IT WILL REACH HERE IN THE US."
2,BAD GIRL...AND EVEN WORST ALBUM,"OK...LET'S GET IT STRAIGHT,PEOPLE...I HAVE TO SAY THAT I'M A MONICA'S FAN, REALLY...AND THAT THE REASON WHY I'M REALLY DISSAPOINTED WHIT THIS CD. SHE WASTED HER SCENT AND DIVA STYLE IN WEAKS SONGS WHICH SOUNDS REPETITIVES AND BORING...ANYWAY, SHE HAS THE VOICE, AND ""SACRIFICIO"",""NO CAMBIES NUNCA"" AND ""VIVO EN TI"" MAKES ME WANNA GIVE 2 STARS TO ""chicas malas""."
3,"Las chicas buenas van al cielo. las malas, a todas partes!","Being a long time fan of Monica Naranjo, I was looking forward to this release. I consider this one to be a better version than her second release palabra de mujer. Here you will find better ballads and better dance tracks in my opinion. Even her voice sounds more mature and better than ever. After her very introspective and dark release titled Minage *my personal favorite* she decided to come back to her roots sort of speak. In my opinion, her stand out tracks here are Chicas malas *the edgiest track on the album really*, de que me sirve ya, no puedo seguir, and lagrimas de escarcha. If you're a fan get it no matter what. If not, then maybe you should listen to the tracks before actually purchasing it. ;-)"
5,Chicas Malas WoW,Este CD de Moncia Naranjo es Uno mas para lo colecion.Monia Naranjo has a voice that makes you want to sing and dance with the rithem with out stoping.El CD esta muy fantastico. Lo malo de el CD es que no lo sacaro en Ingles para latino America. but it's all good I have so It's cool.
5,One of the Greatest Vocalists I have ever heard,"Chicas Malas is a great album by a simply astonishing vocalist. It leans towards her disco tunes, but even if you don't do disco, her voice is beautiful on everything. Everyone with any sense of passion and wonder should get everything Monica Naranjo records. There is no one better, and I have been a music producer for 30 years."
3,HELP! Editors needed!,"While this reference is quite basic, it is easy to follow the lineage and obtain a working knowledge of classical mythology from this book. HOWEVER, beware that there are several misprints that will confuse the reader, as well as references in the index to characters that do not appear on the mentioned page. Thus, the book is in dire need of a decent editor."
1,No Pictures,There are no pictures in this book so it's not much fun. The illustrations that are in the book are bad drawings of ancient sculptures. I'm returning it.
2,Disappointing,"After reading Walk In My Soul and Ride the Wind, this book was disappointing. I finished the book just because I started it and hoped it would kick into gear at some point. This book, with no flair, no characters I loved and a short-cut ending, leaves me not wanting to read her other books. Too bad, I was enjoying the ride."
5,Book plays like a movie,"This was the first book I ever ready by this author, and I've been hooked ever since. Her detail with regard to the life and times are so intricate and realistic that you can ""see the movie playing"" in your head. If you love historical fiction, you'll love reading any of her books."
5,New Rotozip,"The new rotozip is fantastic! The 3-jaw chuck works great (works like my drill). It also comes with a wrench to manually tighten the collet if you prefer to do this. I have been cutting wall tile with the rotozip brand tile bits and they have been breaking on me, which has been frustrating. I switched to a Dremel tile bit, and I have had no problems."
3,It works,"This was a ""reconditioned"" tool which arrived in good shape and works as advertised. No problem."
4,Mirror Neurons,"Prof Gallese estuvo en Tenerife, y conocía bien su trabajo gracias al compendium de Gazzaniga. Es una buena compilación, al día."
5,Johnny Ventura Originales,"This is a great merengue CD. Nothing like ""El Caballo"" to experience the joy of this type of music. I love you Johnny!"
2,flimsy,"The motion detector works fine, but it also seems triggered by the shaking of the garage to which the light is attached. That means, even if nothing is moving in my back yard, which the device is intended to monitor, every time I bring my car into my garage at night, I light up the whole neighborhood.I also cannot adjust where the lamps shine. Why? When I try to adjust the angle, the light base falls out, and I end up with a dangling lamp. It's not worth replacing yet, since it cost a lot to have someone install it for me, but I wouldn't recommend the device to a buyer."
3,Worked for a year........,This feeder worked perfect for about a year until now. The timer is stuck and will not set or send signals to spread the corn. Contacting Moultrie tomorrow and hopefully they will make it right.
1,Great concept that does no perform,"I had a more expensive Moultrie feeder, it tipped over and busted up. So, I get this one. It does not throw the corn. The spinner spins and it just falls off but enough just collects under the spinner. A real pain to assemble. The timer is hard to configure but eventually it will work as scheduled. It holds less than the 200# they state. I may need to really save up and try a Sweeney Feeder or similar more professional feeder than this piece of junk."
3,Only for beginners.,This is a great video lesson for beginners. Not recommended for those who have a background on ballroom dancing. There are only about 3 steps in one dance lesson here.
4,Beautiful Orquestral Textures,"Maybe this is the better Lyrische Symphonie available. Beautiful orchestral textures, superb soloists. Willard White impressive in Symphonische Gesänge, Chailly strong in both."
3,Quality not like they used to make,"Item arrived promptly in good packaging, and was in new condition. However, unlike the material these pajamas used to be made from, the new material (which claims to still be the same, according to the tag) gets fabric pills, and does not have the satiny sheen that the other does. All in all, it's adequate, but rather disappointing. I guess nothing stays the same, but I would have hoped they would get better, rather than worse."
4,As a coach it helped me with my skills drills,The product came on time as stated from the seller. As a book its drills as listed are helping me coach my team to a good season.
3,Thanks to Maya & Aztic civilizations,Hi..It's nice to track the history of something you like & brings you a sense of happiness & joy. I was astonished about the great history of chocolate & its original way of consumption (as Drink!)& its usage as currency in the ancient time!Again it's nice to track the history of something you like & let you remember its origin each time you eat a chocolate bar or a hot foamy chocolate drink :)
3,melted in my hands,"Way too much of this book was spent on talking about non-chocolate related backstories. Do I really need to know who the Maya or Aztecs were? I can read that elsewhere and you're not offering me anything new. Cut to the chase already and start talking chocolate.I grew frustrated reading this especially after reading such fine books on ""commodities"" such as Salt: A World History (by Mark Kurlansky), The Tea Companion (by Jane Pettigrew), The Taste of Conquest: The Rise and Fall of the Three Great Cities of Spice (by Michael Krondl), Banana: The Fate of the Fruit That Changed the World (by Dan Koeppel), this was such a slog to read.Basically, the information in it was good, it just needed reediting."
5,Yum,"I love chocolate. Honestly, I don't know anyone in my circle of friends who doesn't. so when I saw that there was an entire book dedicated to discussing it, well... it was a short walk to the counter. This is a fascinating history. I didn't read the second edition, but I can't imagine it's too different from the first, which was a quick and easy read, and full of entertaining anecdotes."
4,Impressively researched,"This is not the easiest of reads because the style is a little dry and academic. However, this is a serious book and an enormous amount of research has gone into it. Be warned that the first third of the book is set in pre-conquest Latin America and, unless you are a student of the period, it can be quite hard going handling the geography, history and difficult names all at one time! That aside, this is a book for readers that have a serious interest in the roots of cacao and chocolate. Such readers will be well rewarded by this book. In addition, if you are interested in more information about cacao itself, then also read Allen Young's The Chocolate Tree - a Natural History of Chocolate. It's more difficult to read than this one, but no less important."
4,Love the recording/Hate the MP tags,I used to have this recording on vinyl and have been looking for it for years. I think ASMF has done it better than any one else. But the MP3 didn't start with Concerto 1 and some of the movements are out of order!!!! I agree with the 3 star reviews about this. I KNOW this music and and know this recording and find this VERY irritating. On the other hand I am thrilled to have the music performed so well again.
3,To be honest...,"there are other, better recordings. I too have had this recording for several years. It was my first recording of these concertos, and they served me well in those days. But since the time of these recordings, pushed perhaps by the advancement of period instrument play and the subsequent revival of interest in baroque music, the quality we might expect in such productions has risen greatly. Here, the precision of the orchestration and especially some of the soloist work on the second CD is quite shaky. Marriner is undoubtably a fine conductor and there are a slew of other great recordings to turn to in order to hear the ASMF create audible magic. This simply is not one of them. Explore some of the excellent guides out there (Gramophone, Penguin) in order to find a better recording of this lovely opus. I won't go so far as to say Biondi, in that his style is not to all tastes. But pass on this for others. I think even Sir Neville would concur."
4,Haba Mobile,"If you want something basic that doesn't play music, make noise, etc. This is really great."
5,available in a box set,"If you're considering this, you may want to know that these 2-disks are included in the 4-disk box:Kodaly: Orchestral Works / Hary Janos - 4 CD. The other two disks in that box are Kodály's most famous orchestral works, conducted by Antal Dorati:Kodaly: Dances of Galanta; Hary Janos Suite.As you can see, both 2-disk sets are very highly recommended."
4,compare to other recordings,"I have many CD's and DVD's. Ana Vidovic is very accomplished, however not quite at the level of Christopher Parkening or Ricardo Cobo. But still very enjoyable."
4,A Time and A Place for Everything,"I would have to agree with the author on the following point: It certainly does not seem that Mr. Casper has even a casual relationship with the theoretical constructs put forth. That said, however, a ""customer review"" forum does not seem like the appropriate place to wage a war of words. If Mr. Casper believes his arguments are valid, perhaps he could try a more academic forum in which to elucidate for us all the dogma he spews forth,to explain what the bee in his little bonnet is all about."
4,Good product,"I own a 2003 Jeep Wrangler Sport. My OEM airintake was stolen along with some other jeep parts. I found this Intake and ordered it thinking how bad can it be, especially since it was over half of what MOPAR charges for the replacement intake.I am very happy with my purchase so far. My Jeep is running smooth and is responsive. The whole installation was easy and took me about an 1 hour to install by myself. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a new intake.Shipping was quick via UPS and the quality of the product is above average. Love it!"
5,great,Improved mileage. Bought this for the Jeep. Gonna get one for the truck next. Very easy to install.
2,Nothing special,"The K&N didn't do much for my gas efficiency. Which is what I was really looking for. Plus the horse power wasnt anything special. It may have added 10 horses. The only thing that I some what liked about it, is the noise change, you can deffinatly tell"
2,No Performance Gains at all,"I've had this K&N on my Jeep Wrangler for several months now and have found that it really does not give me any gains in fuel economy or horsepower. At best, I've noticed it does make the exhaust system sound a little louder but that does not translate to any performance boost in freeway, street, or off-road driving. To be honest, I didn't buy this system because of any claims by the manufacturer that it would boost fuel or performance, I bought it so I wouldn't have to replace the air filter as often. I live in an extremely dusty area and do a lot of off-roading. The K&N is easy to clean and eliminates the need to constantly buy the stock paper filters. It also seems to filter better than the stock filters. If you're looking for the performance boost that K&N claims then I wouldn't waste your money on this system, if you're just looking for a more efficient air filter over stock then try it but it is expensive for what you get."
1,poor customer service,"the site told me this belt fit my blazer not even close they told me i had to pay for shipping back for there mistake, ripoff in my opinion. stay away far far away from this company"
5,These JBLs produce absolutely *amazing* sound in our 7.1 digital home theater system,"We use a pair of these JBLs as rear speakers in our home theater setup which was recently upgraded to 7.1 digital surround sound. Initially I had bought a pair of Sony Speakers to handle the job, but when these speakers became available (free nonetheless! on our local Reuseit Network) we knew we had to replace the just purchased Sony speakers. Get a pair of these JBLs, you'll be glad you did! They would be excellent as front or side speakers, but, well, we already had large JBL speakers assigned to those locations!For wall mounting, seek out the discontinued Radio Shack wall brackets. They are *the* best for hanging these large heavy JBLs."
1,Be ready to pay more,"The downside to this software tool is that all tech support [is expensive], even for new purchasers.I have a LaCie Pocket Drive that works very nicely with my Mac PowerBook. But I was unable to get Retropect to back up to the Pocket Drive, even after doing all that was recommended by Dantz's manual and on-line help.This is a simple configuration. It should be a piece of cake for backup software. I will look for other backup solutions rather than pay a third again the street price of this software package every time I have a simple problem.Bottom line: This is a complex piece of software that may well cost you more than its purchase price to make it function satisfactorily."
5,"Bluetooth Standard Powered speakers, the iFreedom works with PC/Mac/IPOD!","Saitek made several versions of the A-250, but the one shipping now (late 2007) is the newest iFreedom version which works wirelessly BOTH with PCs AND iPods, or anything else with a mini headphone jack. Connects to PCs AND Macs (OS 10.4 & 10.5 tested) through USB with the included transmitter.OR, you can directly connect to your computer through existing bluetooth (USE Passcode 8888) Alternately, it connects through headphone jacks on other stuff.The bluetooth based transmitter has a rechargeable battery built in.Smaller than you might think from the picture (see description) but excellent sound for the size. The controls work well to pause, skip back and forth in iTunes for PC (but do not work when using the headphone jack, or on a Mac).No interference problems from 30 plus feet away for me, but YMMV. Highly recommended."
3,"solid, but flawed","The sound quality is fine (we're talking about streaming compressed audio here, right? Well, most of us are.) The functionality is fine. Yes, a remote would be a nice addition. And for the price it's very hard to beat.The problem for me anyway is interference. With direct line of sight and just 10-15 feet apart I experience only intermittant and brief interruptions. But any more than that in an apartment, dorm room etc setting and you're asking for trouble. Some buffering ability would be nice. So would a different broadcast medium, such as wi-fi."
2,saitek,i was really excited when i go thisthen i tried to get i tup and running and make it workdont botherit's a great unit in theory but kinda junky in reality
3,"Great Design, Good Sound, Returning it!","First the good stuff:- I think the idea's great, and the design is really cool- The setup was amazingly simple - no software to load or anything- The sound quality (when it works - see below) is great for a 2.4GHz wireless- The speakers are very good for the size - surprisingly deep and richHowever,- The range is EXTREMELY limited (we're talking 15 feet and one or two walls)- All kinds of devices seem to interfere with the reception- Sound drop-outs/skips are extremely annoying- Hard to carry - please provide a handle on the next one?I'm returning my unit and waiting for the next generation. Give these engineers another chance and they'll get it right!"
1,Wireless transmitter won't hold a charge,Never able to get the wireless transmitter to work unless plugged in...defeating the concept of being wireless. Saitek Customer Service suggested sending back the whole unit in order to get the one part replaced (they won't send out a new wireless transmitter)
3,Great concept but lacking,"This is a great toy but it does has it's limitations. If you're going to connect the bluetooth adapter directly to your computer, I suggest you don't. It's a headache since the adapter is plug and play and requires no drivers or software, thus there is no indication whether it's connected or not other than the trivial LEDs. A better alternative would be to purchase a bluetooth adapter and sync up using the 3rd party drivers. That way you can tell exactly when the adapter and speakers are in sync. The passcode is '8888'. With that, you can also sync up your bluetooth mp3 playing cellphones. Have fun.I've read several comments stating that you cannot use your desktop speakers and the Saitek a-250 at the same time. This is quite wrong. You must manually switch audio devices in XP to redirect your audio output. It would be best if you use a media player that allows you to set your sound device."
4,Saitek A-250 Wireless 2.1 Speaker,"Present to my brother. He likes it but said it was a little difficult to start using at first. After that, no problem & great sound from such a small device. Thanks!"
3,Satisfactory,Don't expect it to be as good as a wired speaker set. Base is lacking and the quality and sound resolution is only average.
3,Not wireless enough...,I returned my unit because the wireless connection works only with the USB computer link. The unit does NOT have a wireless connection via the analog audio link.
1,over-rated product,This product was rated very well but fell far short of those ratings. Positive of the product - remote capability. And that's it. The sound quality wasn't much better than your average radio speaker. There are far better products out there.
2,Disappointed,"If you live in an urban area, be careful about purchasing this. My unit works well at times but there's lots of interference. I get about 40% good reception. The other 60% is cutting out due to interference from cell phones. microwaves, etc. beyond my control."
1,Don't bother with this,"I sent the Saitek A-250 back to Amazon within two weeks of opening the box. It never worked as advertised. None of the function buttons (fast forward, rewnd, pause, etc.) worked on the unit, no matter which media player I used; I tried both Windows Media Player and Music Match, two of the most common music players out there, to no avail. The range of the unit was fairly limited in my house, less than 30' from the transmitter base. However, the worst part was the horrible popping and hissing sounds which came out of the speakers at twice the volume of the actual music playing. I thought this would be a cool way to enjoy the digital music from my PC around the house, but the combination of poor sound quality was so poor and nonfunctional technology had this back in the box and returned to Amazon shortly after the holidays. The design of the unit is cool and the idea is perfect, but the execution is completely flawed."
3,difficult and frustrating,"I'm having trouble getting the thing to pick up signals, as well as to broadcast the signal once it intercepts my computer's speakers. The instructions tell you that you have twenty seconds to coordinate the antena with the unit. To me this means I must sit next to the computer during the setup. When it does connect, I want to take the unit with me and then plug it in. Often this causes it to go silent. Yes, I follow all the instructions! It's so frustrating. I wonder if I have a faulty unit or if there is just a better product. The sound is great if I can make it work."
4,SAITEK A_250 Wireless 2.1,"Love the design and price. Sound is good but with too little ""bass"" and no adjustments. Having some dificulty setting up the wireless connection between my laptop and my Saitek.If I should get it working, then I would reccomend this product to anyone. If not I will look for online help."
3,Pretty Good Product with some quirks,I bought the speakers because I was tired of having wires every where. The product serves it purpose. The sound quality is great; was able to listen to music from the computer in the study to my kitchen which is about 100 feet; never lost the signal.The only problem I had was connecting the device; would not pick up the signal at first but after some frustrating time was able to get it going. Every once in a while I have to reconnect when first turning on the computer but nothing major. Like the look and quality; bought a second one for the second computer. I tried to connect two to a computer but it sounded like an echo; will stick to one. Works great with laptop and mp3 player. Don't know how long the battery last yet.
2,"Montrose version of ""Lucky Man"" much better","I searched for years to find the Montrose version of Alan Price's ""A Lucky Man"", which is not to be confused with the ELP song that is much more famous. It's on ""Warner Brothers Presents Montrose"", and it is inspiring, uplifting, fist in the air good. The lyrics give you a chill:""If you have a friend on whom you think you can rely you are a lucky man,If you have a reason to live on and not to die you are lucky man,Preachers and poets and scholars don't know it,Temples and statues and steeples won't show it,If you've got the secret just try not to blow it,Stay a lucky man, a lucky man."""
4,"Brilliant, quirky, soundtrack stands on its own","O Lucky Man is one of the great movies of the last half century. It made a star of Malcolm McDowell, but is too often overlooked. The soundtrack by former Animal Alan Price is a bit like a bluesy Randy Newman, had Randy been born in the UK. Cynical, wise lyrics and appealing music to go with it. Sounds as good on my stereo as it does accompanying the movie. Still, you can't ""get"" the music without seeing the film. Look for this movie!"
1,fake bottoming tap,"They send you what they claim is a bottoming tap but it has a point that will not let it make threads down to the bottom the the hole. Then they say you can grind it down, which could destroy the heat treatment of the tap if not done correctly, making it easier to break the tap in the hole. Buyer beware."
1,"Neither zen, nor artsy, much less knitting","I bought this book to read during my last vacation, and I had to really force myself to keep reading, even during long aiport layovers and longer flights. As mentioned before, the author's real interest is creative types in general, and celebrities. Knitting is almost an afterthought. The chapter on Montessori schools is very interesting, if not poignant, and would have made a great feature story on a knitting magazine. The rest is ranting. If you are a beginner knitter you'll find no useful information here, if you are an intermediate knitter you'll find no inspiration here, and if you are an expert knitter you'll kick yourself for buying this - you should have learned your lesson after ""The Knitting Sutra"" (another waste of a couple of hours that could have been spent knitting)."
5,This is an excellent opera collection,"If you want to get a complete opera, this CD isn't for you, but it is an excellent compilation of different opera arias from various composers, most of which are Italian. Some highlights are ""Vient, Diletto"" and ""Ah Mes Amis""."
4,Professional and Concise Detail on Tom Jeffords Indian Agency,"There are no biographies on Tom Jeffords, although portrayed by Jimmy Stewart in the movie Broken Arrow; however, as a trusted friend of Cochise and the Churicahua people, he had great impact in the negotiations between whites and Indians. He operated a succesful agency that served the Chiricahua well and fairly. I recently visited Apache Pass, along with the remains of Fort Bowie in the pass, and was able to walk among the ruins of Jefford's three room agency building. This brief pamphlete like book provides documentary like information on the digs on the site along with pictures of the findings. Pretty interesting stuff particularly if you have adeep a ppreciation for the west and specifically the Arizona area and the Apache. The book is more for the dedicated historian who will find this book a treasure and combined with a visit to the remote site (110 miles east of Tucson), a real treat of information."
4,"Not a bad machine, but easy to grow out of...","There's nothing inherently wrong with the machine itself, and if you're looking for a way to do circuit training (lower weight, higher reps, little to no rest in between sets) then this machine may last you a while. But without a way to add actual weight, strength training on this machine has a short lifespan. The resistance bands don't work well because they tend to pull the slider board out from underneath you rather than add resistance to the exercise. I guess if you were 300lbs it would stay put, but at 200 and 185lbs, I found it to be problematic. Still, for the $150 price tag, this is much better than any Total Gym knockoff that doesn't have provisions to add free weights in my opinion. I used this for about 9 months and then upgraded to a Bayou Fitness Total Trainer 4000 XL (a much better deal than comparable Total Gyms that have the ability to add free weights)."
4,Nice System for the money,"First of all the Weider Total Body Gym was easy and quick to assemble.The Gym is longer than I expected but it definetely can give you adecent workout. You can work the chest, back, triceps and biceps fairly easyand you can also get a light workout for your legs by doing a form of squats-standing leg pressesand you can add resistance to the exercise by using the 4 elastic bands at the bottom of the Gym.The only complaint that I have is: The Gym has a washer on each cable where the handles are attachedand the washers cut into your arm and forarm as you perform the exercises.Other than that it's a nice little exercise system that can compliment your days off from theworkout gym that you normally go to."
5,weider 5000,"I am a big guy at 6.2 265 puonds and I wanted to say the weider 5000. It holds my body weight just fine and WOW what a workout. So if you heard big guys cant workout this machine, thats just not true. I say this because I was worried about my height and size. So if you are thinking about buying this machine I say go for it. ITS GREAT!!!"
4,great deal for home gym,"I purchased this gym recently, looking for a less expensive alternative to the ""Total Gym"". I am pleased with my choice. If you are looking for a home gym that you can work all of your body, this is a great option. I found I can work all the exercises that the ""total Gym"" advertises, and there is no adjustments to make, no bringing out weights, or changing attachments. It allows me to do a complete workout in a short time in a small space, and then put it away and no-one knows it's there.The only thing I have found with this gym is for the ladies, it is heavy to lift and carry from it's storage place to where I workout and back. But it is a solid sturdy machine, and I love what it can do, so well worth the struggle.So if you can't afford the ""Total Gym"", or just can't see spending that kind of money for a machine just cause a celebrity endorses it, then you might want to consider this as an alternative."
4,"Nice test to see if you like ""Total"" equipment.","I only payed a little over 100 bucks for mine. I think it's a very good test, to see if you'll like the ""Total"" trainer style equipment at all, before investing big bucks. This machine is a good starting point, I do like it and it does give a good workout. I'm 6 foot even and it does seem long enough. I like to go to muscle failure on most exercise sets, and this does the trick. My favorite part is the pullups. It has limited ability for lower body, I can do the leg presses all day, it gets boring (even with all the bungie cords initiated). I also suspect this machine is hard on shoulder joints, so be careful. Overall a good purchase, but I wish to upgrade to the superior Bayou Fitness Total Trainer."
1,RUN AWAY FROM ICON FITNESS,Owned by Icon Fitness (who also make Nordic Track and a bunch of other crap). Icon Fitness is the worst company on earth - avoid at all costs.
1,I need some assembly help!!!,"I just recieved my weider total body works 5000, I cant get the seat to move. Short knob #44 that supposedly moves the machine does nothin. Please help... And these people at customer service arent responding...AHHHHHHH!!!!"
3,Scratches floor!,"Be forewarned my fellow Amazonian, the front base support will scratch the hell out of your floors if you don't put some sort of mat or carpeting underneath. I found this out, much to my dismay, after the first initial use. I now have deeply scratched hardwood floor as a result. Underneath the 2 holes where you connect your foot plate the metal extend from the cross bar several centimeters, so during normal use it may grind against the floor underneath it.Otherwise, the product does what it advertised, hence 3 stars. I'm still greatly annoyed at this seemingly lack of attention to detail in the design."
3,Very large,Did not know how heavy and large this unit was. I still use it from time to time. Had knee surgery and not really to go back to working out.
3,Total Body Works 5000,"I like this machine, But the Handals are Crap!! They broke just after the Warrenty expired!! I would not want the same Handlas anyway."
4,Great machine for a great price,"For the price, it would be hard to find another machine that can replicate all the exercises this one can do. Was very easy to assemble, took < 15 minutes from opening the box until I was using the machine. Only con I can think of with the machine is once you're using it at the full incline position, you're sorta limited you can increase resistance. The 12.5lb straps help out in that regard, but would also be nice to have way to expand it further."
4,great workout,built durable and does exactly what it was made for. When used correctly you will see and feel great results. For the price it is an excellent investment.
3,ok for the price,"For the price it works not too bad. The machine does give a good workout and serves its purpose. It's a little heavy and awkward when pulling out the foot plate and raising the levels. It you are not that strong with your upper body then this machine would be difficult to open and adjust. The sliding bench also came off track and is a pain to get back on. I did not feel like paying a lot of money for the other products. But, if you want a better quality product I suggest to look elsewhere. I found the product for 99 bucks at the Weider website."
4,Feralkitty,I received the gym about 1 week ago. I was happy with the fast delivery. The set up was easy but getting the seat to slide took a little while. I finally figured out to pull the short knob with one foot on the end to the machine and push up the handle bars released the seat. I wish it came with a DVD but I made a little book with the exercise diagrams and attached it to the machine for easier access. I would recommend this product for a work out.
2,bulky and heavier,"I returned this machine. It was bulky and heavier than the description online. It did not come assembled as expected. I received it in poor condition as far as the packaging is concerned. I can say however, they made it extremely easy to return the product. They refunded my money on the day I called and had the equipment picked up at my home within two days."
3,Would not honor the warranty on the 91st day. Parts are to expensive!,"I bought the Weider 5000 on September 9, on December 2009 the plastic on the handle cracked and the webbing of the handle got caught and ripped nearly in half before I noticed it. Called the company and they told me the warranty ran out yesterday. The new handles would have cost me $53.00 plus shipping. I will make a set of handles that will last more than 3 months. The machine does what I want it to do but it is cheaply made. Keep an eye on every part of it before you exercise."
4,weider total body works,i really like the gym wish i hade baught it sooner .the one thing i hade a problem with wase the handels there real cheap the right one came with a sevear crack with a chunk of plastick out of it so it didnt turn like it should and the left just hade a chunk out of it still works but i doubt fore long. i still think fore the money it is a good buy
3,confused,"I wrote a review for the other product called Total Body Works 5000 and now I'm writing one for this product. Here is why. I originaly ordered the other Total Body Works 5000, because it had better reviews and was less expensive. When the box came it turned out to be this Weider Total Body Works 5000. The picture on the box showed the model without the Weider logo on the seat, but inside was the exact model shown here. There was no booklets or paper work in the box at all so I had to contact the Weider Co. In doing so, I found out that I could have ordered directly from them and it would have been much less expensive. I do like the machine and it's versitility, but am surprised that I did not get the best price available."
1,Weirder total body works 5000 gym,"You couldn't really tell what kind of exercises you would be benefitting from, I really needed lower body ones and when I received it is a lot of upper body stuff, which I am good in that areA."
4,Gets the job done,"Sturdy Construction, easy to use. WELL worth the price, and incredibly flexible in terms of different exercises.I only have a couple small complaints:1. The cables are too short (buy some links of chain & a connector & problem solved).2. The pad itself was bolted onto the slide at a slight angle. Works fine, but there is a weird optical illusion that makes it look like you're not sliding straight up and down."
4,well worth the money,"I've had this machine for a month now. We purchased a DVD for the total gym and found that Dan Isaacson's workout on the DVD could be done on the TotalBody 5000. Some of the Total Gym exercises (Leg exercises) aren't possible without adding some leg cables and pulleys. (I may modify it, if I really want those exercises). I don't think it takes away from the Weider TotalBodyWorks. There are plenty of other possibilities to cover those muscle groups. I am satisfied with the construction of the machine and the wife can easily adjust it to her needs.I think it's a terrific value and wouldn't hesitate buying another. If you are thinking about the total gym and can't afford it or just want to try something like it. This is the ticket."
3,works good,"somewhat unstable, and I can not shorten the length, I accidentally made it too long, and now refuses to shorten! The exercises work great though"
4,Very Fun,"I have to say this is one of the most fun ways to do strength training that I have tried. You actually move versus just sitting around lifting heavy objects. It feels far less boring.I am 6'4"" and the machine fits me very well. After a few uses I have certainly found it very effective in making my muscles nice and sore. Great machine.On the downside, I disagree with many of the reviewers that say the machine is very well made. The pulleys sometimes do not hold the the cable in place, and it slips between the wheel of the pulley and its housing. I also find the machine to be a bit rickety. There's a lot of play in bench and the stand could be quite a bit more stable. These are critical areas that I will look for during the next purchase of a similar machine."
4,Worth it!,"I purchased this a year or so ago because, well, I can't afford a Bowflex, and it was worth the money! I don't use it as much as I should, but that's a different story.The only issues I have with it is that when you are resizing it you need to be careful. You are lifting up this heavy piece of metal machinery and pulling out a tab to make it larger or smaller, and a few times my wife and I have almost hurt ourselves due to it coming out faster than we anticipated.Once it's set up properly it works great, and allows a lot of different exercises. It actually does not have weights on it, and is set up to use your body as the weight. It starts out as just a sliding mat, where you can push or pull yourself on it. On the bottom it has four bungy cord that you can attach to make it harder. So far I'm at 2!"
4,Good Experience,The Weider 5000 gym is a quality piece of home exercise equipment. It is sturdy and operates well supporting a man of 250 lbs trying to become a man of 200 lbs.
5,This was a great buy,"I was not disapointed with this product. I was gonna buy the total gym version of this machine, but I saw this one on amazon and gave it a go; I wouldn't go back. I saved alot of money and I got exactly the same work out that I would have gotten if I would have ordered the total gym. I recommend this product over and over :)"
2,Poor workmanship,"Had the Weider gym for less than 4 months and have had it fall apart on me on numerous occassions.Really enjoyed working out on it, but too many times I have had the gym literally come apart and become almost damaged at this point due to frequent use. Sorry but dont invest in this equipment!!"
1,"Poor shipping, little instruction","When I received this product all the hardware to put it together was missing. It was so poorly boxed for shipping that it fell apart and I don't blame UPS. They did send me the missing parts but by the time I got them it was too late to return and the cost of shipping it back wasn't worth it.There are very little instructions on assembling the machine and using the machine. It is very heavy and takes up a lot of floor space when in use. It is very hard to store, awkward to fold up and heavy.I suggest buying equipment like this at a store where you can see it and try it out."
2,Manufacturing Defect,"When I received the machine, I noticed that the plastic piece the weight bungees attach to was broken off and the bottom halves on the screws were stuck inside the frame. Also the holes the feet rest is supposed to fit into were bent so it was impossible to insert it. Customer service was completely useless. I had to bring out the power tools and work at it for several hours, but was eventually able to get it in working order. After all that work, the machine seems to work OK. That's the only thing saving this machine from a 1 star review. I'll never risk buying a product from Weider again."
1,Waiting for Weider,The Weider Total Body Works 5000 Gym arrived with parts missing. The person in the parts department was not very apologetic and told me it would be 7 to 10 business days before the missing parts arrived. He could care less that they had inconvenienced me. The attitude shows a lack of appropriate customer service. So far Weider is off to a bad start in gaining my fidelity as a customer.
4,Total Body;total experience,total body works 5000 is just what I wanted and expected. with the exception of not getting an instruction video or DVD if one of those items had been included it would make the total body 5000 perfect. But as it is you just have to study the diagram that came with it to figure how to do the exercises. It's trial and error; But the machine WORKS.
4,A Real Exercise Bargain,"Considering the bargain-basement price, I was skeptical that this ""Total Gym"" knock-off would perform well. But the Total Body Works 5000 delivers.The construction is remarkably sturdy... the fit and finish is good... and the mechanisms all work smoothly. Overall, it's a great product and provides a decent workout.The one drawback is that it doesn't store as compactly and easily as the ad hints. Plan on losing 4"" x 2"" of floor space when it's not in use."
4,Awesome machine for the price!,"I bought this unit (without expecting much) mainly to be able to use pulley exercises in rehabilitating my injured shoulder.For the price - I'm amazed at how many exercises you can do without making any change overs between them. This allows you to go from one exercise to another without any rest between sets.The only change I make to the set up, during my workout, is to remove the footplate and replace it with the chin up bar (I lay on my stomach, knees bent, and use it for an inverted military press). I feel like my shoulders get a more focused workout than they do with the seated military press; but the seated press also works the abs, so I switch between the two.I've never used a Total Gym - I hear it's a better machine; but since I don't know what I'm 'missing' (and at 1/3 the price), I'm extremely satisfied with this purchase."
4,AGoodWorkOut,A great workout for the dollar... couldnt beat the price... yooooo chuck norris you better do something with your price this weider total gym blows yours out the box for the money... LOL...
4,Good value,"LIke others have commented, the box arrives looking pretty beat up but the gym itself is OK. Some of the fasteners had rattled loose but they were easy enough to put back where they belonged. It all appears to be made from heavy duty steel. We found the incline adjustment to be very easy to use. We like just changing your body position to change what muscles you are working on. That is a real time saver! We are feeling the burn. We got this from Amazon for $129. Cheaper than buying used gym equipment on Craig's list.I have recommended this to friends."
4,I can't believe the low price,"If you want to use this 3 times a week, get it. If you want to workout 2 hours a day, trade up. I got this with my Gazelle Edge and I love it. I'm toning up, so this was the best option for me.Easy to assemble (already pre-assembled so no tricky setup). Easy to use. LOVE that it fits upright in my closet.Make sure you carry with a second person if you have to go up stairs. I learned the hard way."
5,Even better than expected!,"This thing is very sturdy, easy to set up, and I get a great workout. I like being able to work every part of my body on one piece of equipment...and it's very easy to change from one exercise to the next. One caution - it is LONG when fully setup. If you're tight on space, check the specs first to be sure you have room. We had seen a similar version on TV for way more money, but this is all you need! Very pleased!!!"
2,A year after,I have had this gym for a year. I have been in the gym for years. This pull feature hurt my shoulder. The pulleys wear down after months. All you really can do are 3 exercises at the must. I wanted this machine to work. I had high hopes. I used a total gym when they first came out. For the price I could not recommend this to an expert or anyone.
3,sort of confused,"I am a bit confused. I looked at this Total Body Works 5000 machine and also looked at the Weider Total Body Works 5000. Because this one had better reviews and was less expensive I ordered it, from Outlet Trail.When I received it, it was in fact, the Weider Total Body Works 5000. Thepicture on the box showed this machine, but it was made by the Weider Co. Unfortunitly, there was no set up or workout manuels in the box. I had to contact Weider to get info. In doing this I also discovered that I could have ordered directly from Weider and purchased this item quite a lot cheaper. Buyer beware, if you are interested, go to Weider website. As far as how the machine works, I like it's versatility."
2,Dissappointing,"The unit arrived from UPS after opening it looks like someone else used it, did not like it and returned it. There are all kinds of scratches and scuffs. The unit comes with little information although assembly was fairly simple. I had read that it did not come with any workouts so I ordered one separatley-waste of $15 as the unit came with it's own wallchart. Some of the workouts say ""unhook"" pulley system but there are no intructions how do that."
1,Unhappy,"It came in the time frame that it was suppost to. And I got free shipping, which was great. And it was at least $200.00 cheaper than the Manufactory website. But.....it was put together wrong at the factory. The slider grips were attached below the bar that holds the pad that you lay on. So you can't get it to slide to do the exercises. So, if I want to use it. I'm going to have to take it apart completely. And put it back together myself. They included a sheet that shows how it was put together bolt by bolt and nut by nut. They must have known, that it was put together wrong. I'd send it back, but it'd cost me more than it's worth to ship it. So no, I'm not happy at all."
4,Weider Total Body Works 50000 Gym,I found this product to be a good purchase. It is a solid piece of equipment that provides a multitude of exercises and levels of difficulty. The company shipped promptly and set up was easy. I would recommend this product to others. It is priced well for what it does.
5,totally works for me,"I bought this machine to finally start doing something at home and I must say, I am finally doing something. Now only if I would stick to it! The machine is very sturdy, maybe a little too heavy but very well put together. Assembly wasn't too bad and set up to workout is easy. Challenging to slide it back for storage, but nothing you can not get used to. The pulleys needed to but oiled to decrease the squeaking, but once done they run very smoothly. The only two cons I have so far are: the foot plate could have been bigger, especially if you want to do squats the right way and it doesn't come with many examples of workouts, there are supposed to be more than 100, but the poster only shows 29. All in all, I am very satisfied with this machine, it's definitely worth the money. Now all I want is to wake up in the morning and be totally lean and transformed. Great product."
1,Not impressed,This was very easy to put together but the whole unit is not as sturdy as I hoped and the arm pullys are way too long. Sent it back and received a fast return.
1,"Good product, lousy cables.","I purchased the Weider 5000 on 2/13/12. I noticed today on 5/14/12 that the coating around the cables is fraying.I called ICON Health, the limited warrenty company. They wanted $113.00 for a set of cables. The product was $129.00 total. After much proding on my part they will give me a ""coutesy"" free cable. Mind you the wattenty is 90 days from date of PURCHASE not the date it is received."
4,"Great value card, but beware - no TV out as stated in descri","I installed this card in my son's Dell Dimension. The TNT2 that was standard wouldn't display his new Sponge Bob game. This one installed with no problem and worked with the game. I do not plan to use it with a TV, but you should be aware that there is only one output on back, no TV out as stated in the description."
3,really looks like spock but color is off,"This really looks like Nimoy but the color of his shirt isn't right. It should be much lighter blue, and you can't really tell the color is wrong from the picture."
3,a compelling goal without solid footholds,"Barolsky proposes that Michelangelo invented himself. This self-creation combines allusions to Socrates, St. Paul, Moses, God, Dante, and David. Michelangelo apparently constructed, or perhaps scuplted, the image of himself that comes down to us through Vasari and his descendents. It's an interesting and provocative thesis which undoubtedly has some merit. However, this book delves into untethered speculations - or that's my impression without doing the research myself. There's a lot of ""mights"" and ""very well could haves"" and a lot of appreciating ironies that are admitted to be unlikely, if not impossible connections. This kind of thing works with a more playful tone (a la Rem Koolhaas's ""Delirious New York"") but fails to convince and leaves the reader to sort the interesting trivia from the half-inspired speculations."
5,Drumming for everyone*,Karim explains the techniques so well that anyone whom dares to pick up the drum will def. achieve something. He elaborates the meaning of the beat and where it comes from and Mr. Nagi knows the origin of the music he plays. I'm a dancer and not a drummer but this even helps me familiarize with the dance beats. I give this a A+!
4,An enjoyable book,"It explains a lot of things that I've never imagine about this breed. (maybe because I had never read nothing about pitbulls, but it's a good book)"
5,A must have for fans of the breed,"If you want to learn a lot about the American pit bull terrier, this is the book to pick up.This book talks about every aspect of the breed, starting with its history as a hunting and bull handling dog. It touches on related breeds, common ""pit bull myths,"" and the modern American pit bull terrier today. It also talks about the specifics of acquiring and keeping a pit bull, without turning into a generic book on dogs or dog care.The book is also full of nice color pictures (vintage and modern) of a wide variety of dogs. The photos alone are worth the price of the book in my opinion.It was written by the incomparable Dianne Jessup (check out her website at [...] ) If you're interested in pit bull dogs you will enjoy this book!"
5,The Greatest Book Ever Written About Pit Bulls!!!!!!!!,"I am the owner of 2 Pit Bulls and this is definitely the best book I have every gotten my hands on. I am a collector of Pit Bull items and have a large collection of books pertaining to this wonderful breed. Diane Jessup's book by far is the best book on the market for Pit Bull owners. This book is the most informative book available on Pit Bulls. It includes everything from the past, like their days as herding dogs and pit fighters, to present day. This book focuses on every aspect of the breed (good and bad). If your looking for some great pictures, this is the book for you. It is full of pictures of very old dogs and also tons of recent photos. I would recommend this book to any Pit Bull owner or dog lover."
3,very good magician,"I consider that it is one of the books but complete of pit bull that have read. the same one shows us the versatile thing that it is our dear race and all the tasks that she is able to carry out. however, I think that to achieve dogs with as much docility as those that appear in the book it is necessary to be but that love or friend a very good magician. I recommend it thoroughly and I hope they enjoy it."
2,Very good sound but...,I bought these headphones for my ipod to use while working out. They are very comfortable and the sound quality is very good for phones of this price. After six months the left ear phone stopped working for no apparent reason at all. If not for the short life span I would buy these again. Jim in Maine
5,Sony S2 Sports Water Resistant Behind-the-Neck Headphones,I bought these headphones as a gift for my husband. He is always running or training for a marathon and his old headphones would slip off his ears as he was running. Even when he sweats (which he certainly tends to do since we live in the desert) these headphones stay on. He is very happy with the sound quality. He uses these with his Ipod - I bought him the adapter so these would work for him - and he says he has no need to turn it up all the way. He says they are comfortable and likes that they have reflectors for when he runs in the evening. May buy myself a set!!!
4,Another concept,Headphones provide are great sound it is not a good fit for my large head/face hard if you have a tight fitted helmet. This would be my second or third choice.
4,good and reliable,the product is good and reliable for continuous music listening but the neck band is some what bigger than needed so it kind of fits loosely behind the neck
2,"Two months of light use, already dead","I haven't used these for exercising. I just wanted a comfortable pair of headphones that go behind-the-neck. And yes, they are very comfortable. A bit loose, albeit. I bought these May 10, 2010, and it is July 16, 2010; they have already died.Out of the blue, sitting at my computer desk, they ceased to function. I reverted to an old pair that worked fine in my computer, and see nothing wrong with the wires on these headphones. They just randomly quit working. Yeah, that's a bummer. I paid for these, it's past the warranty date, and I lost the money spent.Do not recommend."
5,Wonderful headphones!,"I have been using these headphones for years, because I don't care for the in-ear kind, just uncomfortable. I like these quite well, fit is very good, sound is rich, these are the best workout headphones that I have ever used, and I have tried others. I bought another pair just in case the last pair quits, but I have not had a problem with this brand of headphones since the beginning. I would throughly recommend these to someone that worksout or even a brisk walk."
4,Excellent Little Machine....,"This is a great little sander that I find myself using more and more. While it certainly isn't as aggressive as a full size belt sander, for a smaller project, it's handy and gets the job done. It's light enough to use it with one hand, and it's small size gets it into tight spots. I've taken off the front handle a few times to get even closer to edges. I'm a hardwood flooring contractor, and the 60/80 belts can handle oak flooring easiliy. It won't replace a random orbital, for fine work, or a belt for bigger jobs, but you'll use it more than you think.My only gripe is that the belts are too expensive. But the model is brand new, and they'll get cheaper over time, with some more competition."
2,ORDER AN EXTRA DRIVE BELT!!!,Purchased on 3 APR 2011 and it was shipped on 6 APR 2011. Sander arrived quickly and all was well till about 1 year later.1 estimate the sand had maybe 2 weeks of use in that time as I only used 4 belts and they still have plenty of life left in them. the today 14 JAN 2012 the drive belt broke. Trying to get a NEW Drive belt.
2,Oil leak day after initial startup,"The sander started leaking oil about a day after initial start up. I did not sand anything with it initially. It was only a test run. After wiping up the oil and tightening the bolts on the gear box case, I tried using it for about 10 minutes. The sander did a fantastic job and I really liked the form factor. However, it got very hot as other reviewers have noted. Mine started smoking. That was the point where I decided to return it. No problems with Amazon return. I had mine hooked up to a shop vacuum while using it too as others suggested. Perhaps using a different brand or grit of sand paper might help with the heat problem as well as others have suggested. There is a possibility that I received a bad unit, but I do not think that I will try purchasing this product again."
4,work horse---a hot one at that,"I have had my sander now for nearly 3 years. i have beat the crap out of it sanding very large projects. i replaced the brushes once. tracking has been fairly good with the belts. the only problem is it heating up. good to use in the winter--it keeps your hand warm. otherwise i hold it by the front handle and the cord as the body is too hot to hold. for what i use it for there is no other sander on the market i could switch to, so i will buy another when this one finally dies (it is on it's way). i will give it a proper burial as it has been a fine assistant in my work. if they could fix the heating up issue they would have a great little sander."
4,comfortable sander,"A belt sander is always an agressive tool which has to be used gingerly. I like this compact sander because it is small, light and easy to maneuver. The belt tracks well, can be adjusted easily. I will probably use it more than my heavy, large Bosch sander. The price is reasonable."
2,for non-demanding uses only,"PROS: small and light weightCONS: gets extremely hot (too hot to touch), not powerful, tracking needs constant adjustment, non-standard size belts (may be hard to find)BOTTOM LINE: as you can see this is not a tool a professional would want to buy, but if you just need a belt sander for small work, then it may be ok"
1,it died young,"This little sander was a beast when it worked. The third time I needed it, it would not engage the roller wheels. The warrenty was over, and lowe's said take it to porter cable. I took it to the trash with a porter cable orbit sander that died after a few projects too. No more PC for me... My Hitachi, Bosch, De walt, Mliwaulkee tools always work when I need them. Im hard on all my tools."
1,Portable Space Heater,"I purchased this sander 1 year ago and have used it twice to sand the edges of 3/4 inch Baltic Birch. The sander with the first use performed adequately although it did heat up quickly to the point that it was uncomfortable to grasp. On second use today, the sander again overheated after 10 minutes of use and then began to smoke, spark, lost speed and began to emit a grinding noise. I disassembled the unit and noted the brushes were fine. I reassembled it and the same problem arose. I suspect the motor coils are fried. This is a poorly designed sander. There is no fan to move the heat which stays in a confined space because of the small form factor. This should be equipped with a heat overload circuit. If you are planning on sanding balsa wood for a few minutes this will work. If you plan on sanding anything denser than balsa, save your money and buy a better belt sander."
3,A disappointment ......Didn't last four hours,"Bought this sander last night and returned it by 2 pm today because it quit working when the drive belt shredded and got sucked around the drive mechanism. I really liked it for the project at hand....scribing window frames but as other reviewers had said it got hot to the touch,the sanding belt would wander, and the dust collection without a bag or vacuum was terrible . Returned it and bought the Makita 9911,which finished the project and is now my favorite sander. Was surprised because I have always had great luck with Porter Cable power tools. So if you'll looking for a lighter weight belt sander have a look at the Makita 9911."
2,Very hot sander,"Bought this sander because of the size. Nice to have a one hand belt sander for those small odd jobs. The problem, it gets to hot to hold. Did not use it much because of the heat and today it went up in smoke. I have several Porter Cable tools and they worke well with the exception of this one. Just ordered a replacement Bosch sander 3x21 for those smaller jobs. Gave it two stars because of the basic design. Great idea, poor quality, should have been removed fron the product line. Should also add that the belts are hard to find and are some what costly."
4,One HOT sander...,"This is a very fine belt sander and much less fatiguing to use than it's larger counterparts. I wouldn't fault it in any way other than the sucker gets hot enough to be uncomfortable to use. I suppose simply putting on some gloves would work, but, I've never seen another sander get so hot so quickly. It would be a 5 star sander, but I don't feel that's justified with the heat issue. I would buy it again and I love using it."
5,Great Little Sander,I purchased this sander without realizing that there was a vacuum attachment supplied. With the attachment there is no dust exiting the sander. I simply hooked up the vacuum attachment to a small wet vac with a little duct-tape to secure.Highly recommended!
4,Great gift,"My daughter is very happy with the fragrance. I don't care to endorse anything bimbo Britney puts her name on, but this perfume is popular with the girls."
1,Not Worth the Money,"As a student, I found this book to be inadequate and rather frustrating. Lack of example problems causes extreme weakness in material coverage. Problems at the end of each chapter are confusing at best and require extensive guidance from a qualified professor. Also the book is far overpriced. I would definitely prefer to use another book for my class."
2,Nice Try,"This is a very good book for indepth information into the working of jet and rocket propulsion. However, as a student in aerospace engineering, I find it lacking examples of any kind throughout the entire book. Without examples it is very difficult to take in and understand fully what the author is discussing. Unless you already know a good deal about engines, this might not be the book for you."
3,decent text,"The text is well-written and encompases a great deal about aerospace propulsion. There are few example problems, and the problems at the end of each chapter are worded so poorly it is difficult to know what is wanted without already knowing. Although the text is wonderfully instructive, it is a rather irritating textbook."
1,I've seen better.,"This book had good intent, but not enough reality. Prayer and fasting are important parts of Christianity, but there are better ways to do it. The author is pompous, and has a ""you should do this, because I do it and I am a better Christian than you"" attitude. There are many other books out there about prayer or fasting or both, and they are much less ostentatious. (To paraphrase a quote from Anne Lamott: The only difference between God and this author, is that God never thinks He's this author.)"
3,did not fit,Did not fit as advertised on my 1990 Dodge W250. Apparently there were several hubs used that year and i have the older style. Too bad the fitment guide isn't accurate. Otherwise they look well made.
4,Ion da ghetto blaster 2009,"Great portable system for on the go party... uses either Ipod Or rca jack devices to plug in. perfect for outside BBQs and such ... only drawback Volume could be a skosh louder.. but If ya hook it to an amp its cool..... Oh Its perfect for when ya lose power it has a 12 hr battery!!! we was playing acar show and power went out (storm) so, we was the only ones still kickin we had enough power to play for 2 mo hours while the rest of the place was lost..everyone migrated to our sound it was cool..."
1,piece of junk,"I brought the product 8 or 9 weeks ago, and it worked the first time I tried it. Then I put it away, and didn't pull it out again until recently. When I tried it again, it wouldn't work with the battery or with the electric cord. Customer service was of no help. ""I can't tell you what your problem is. You need the receipt, and you have to ship it to our repair facility in Reno, Nevada."" I couldn't find the receipt, so that was it. Terrible product, junk customer service, and a complete waste of money!!! Don't buy any of their products or you'll regret it."
2,Battery doesn't last,"I bought this a couple of years back, it worked well at first but the battery has now 'bit the dust' it works well when plugged in just doesn't retain a charge"
1,Great Sound...Poor battery life,"I purchased this item for an outdoor boot camp after another trainer had great success with it. I can't say my story is the same. I charged the battery for two days initially until all the lights were green only for the battery to die 30-minutes into class. It says the battery life is for 12 hours, but I can barely get 1-hour. This instance has happened every time I use it, so it is consistent. Needless to say, I am asking for a refund."
2,Not a good purchase for Fitness Classes,"My partner got the ion for our aerobics class. He seems to love it and I did until my class participants arrived...as soon as there are more people in the room, its not loud enough and it skipped every other word in a song, very frustrating in a zumba class. I think it will be fine in home settng"
5,Excellent for School Activities!!!,I bought this to help bring sound to events at the high school that I work at and the Rockblocker is perfect. The sound quality in a large cafeteria is excellent and the microphone is a real plus. Highly recommend for price and quality.
1,"terrible quality, terrible customer service","I must say, in the first four months, I felt like this product was awesome. Decent sound, portable, loud, and fun. But then the ipod dock started malfunctioning. Now when the microphone is on over medium volume, the sound breaks up. I called customer service and after 52 minutes of holding, the man gave me a phone number to call for servicing my block rocker that no longer serviced them. A complete waste of my time. Another call, another hour of holding and they disconnect me. So in short, the product falls apart and the company will do nothing to help you out. i would not recommend this to anyone."
1,IT WON'T LAST BUY SOMETHING ELSE,The battery does't last more than 1 month before it is worthless. Ion will not support this product. After the battery went the IPOD dock began to fail. At about 6 months in this product is worthless. Funny - it looks like it is well built but this product is garbage!!!!!!!!!!
1,No sound.,"I bought this item because of good reviews. However, the one I got had no sound when you plugged the microphone which should be plug and play. I returned and got another one but I had the same problem. I called the manufacturer and it was verified there was technical issues. I do not know if it is just a fluke but both of items I got were defective. Needless to say I do not have one now."
2,Good For a Minute,"When I first received this I was excited! I bought a headset microphone in addition. I teach several workout classes and it was great. Then a few weeks later the Mics stopped working, including the one that came with it. Then a week later it stopped holding a charge. Now the only way I can play it, is plugged up. I can't turn it up too loud because the music starts to skip because of the power strength of the battery. Highly disappointed. I read reviews before I bought it. A lot of people talked about this problem, but I bought it anyway. Thinking that I will get better results. Well, I didn't. Now I have a forty pound paper weight! Ouch!"
5,ION Block Rocker is a BLAST for on the go and at home!,We love our ION Block Rocker. We take it on the go and play with it at home. It's an absoulute Blast! It was delivered in record time. Thanks again Amazon. Kellie Kent
5,"As promising, ROCKER does ROCK!","I now have use this a quite a while now, the best part of it, it I can take it just about anywhere EVEN ON ROAD TRIPs!!!!The size is reasobale, as well as weight, the battery life does last long and when it needs to be charge, I leave it the entire night and it charge well.The Digital tune is great too! no problem. Sound is great as well as the base.I DONT NEED A ""DJ"" ANYMORE! A IPOD OR PANDORA, IS ENOUGH FOR SATISTYING!"
5,IPAO3 Portable,It sound great and when I take it to the baseball park everybody always ask where did u get that. I say at Amazon.com
1,Disappointed with the product,"I bought our unit in June and it only lasted two months, used few times and now it does not emit sounds at all, tried all our iPods and iPhone and still no sounds, very disappointed with this product."
2,Disappointed,"The product delivery speedy and the product worked wonderfully plugged in until... I charged it for a BBQ birthday party and my to my surprise the product does not work. It only works plugged in I was trying to get intouch with someone through the warrenty but it is also dam near impossible. I will have to wait until the 4th of July is over to be able to get it fixed. So much for my booming sound system for the holiday weekend,Disapointed CustomerION Block Rocker Battery Powered Speaker System for iPod"
2,Great system--while it worked.,"I bought this system new through Amazon in November 2008 and now the battery won't hold it's charge, so its no longer portable. I loved it while it worked, though... Great sound, and perfect for parties. Unfortunately, Amazon says its no longer eligible for return so I will have to call Ion and see what they can do for me."
1,Misleading cover. Fair content.,"In spite of the title, only three of the episodes include both Stan and Ollie. One is a promotional short for wood products in which a narrator talks while Stan and Ollie mug and react. It's from relatively late in their career...in original color and kind of cute (although I skipped to the next item about 2/3 of the way through).The last three are Stan Laurel silent features, parodies of popular movies of the day. ""Mud and Sand"" has Stan as Rhubarb Vaseline, an ersatz Valentino a la ""Blood and Sand."" The films are pretty good but no Ollie in spite of the Duo title.There's a home movie compilation and an all-star short fund raiser for the National Variety Artists tuberculosis sanitarium. The Little Rascals get as much celluloid as Stan and Ollie in this one. (It's ""Stolen Jools,"" not ""Stolen Tools"" as the box says.)So be forewarned and be aware that many of these films can be viewed on YouTube or viewed and downloaded at Archive.org."
1,"Never Received this item from Seller,","I never received this item from Seller, so I cannot recommend Seller or Item. I'm still waiting patiently."
2,abe lincoln.,"The title of this book is misleading, because only a very small portion was dedicated to his youth.The story just kind of rambles around and the same incident is retold in a different manner."
1,Watch out for shipping charges,"I was dumbfounded to find that I was spending nearly half the cost of the unit just for shipping -- something which really messed up my budget for this project. This was purchased from WAM Home Center - watch out for this seller.This unit had several quality issues, the main one being that the electrical knock-out did every thing in its power to stay in place. I ended up having to use a hacksaw to cut the electric access hole. Knocking out the plate would not work, I gave up after nearly destroying the unit, and sawing had to be done with laying it onto the floor where the main heater unit fell out and damaged the heating fins. I was disappointed in the extreme."
1,Legs and Box - Total Bummer,"Ditto on the other reviews...the minitrampoline was in a flimsy box which caused damage to the item and it was actually packed without legs. In addition, resolving this issue has been very difficult. Was looking forward to a great exercise and fitness experience - instead got a stressful hassle trying to resolve a manufacturer error!"
3,Shipping Quality,"I received the Trampoline in a very timely manner. However, the trampoline was not packed properly. The box was cheap, flemsy with several rips and cuts! Because the trampoline was not protected in plastic, the outer blue cover of the trampoline was damaged. I have contacted GoFit directly and they informed me that they would be sending a new one. However, I have not yet received it.A.McCullough"
3,NO LEGS,I WAS SO EXCITEDWHEN I PURCHASE THIS ITEM BUT WHEN I REALISED THERE WERE NO LEGS I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED. I AM STILL TRYING TO GET THE LEGS AND HOPE IT WON'T BE SUCH A HASSLE.
4,jumping away the pounds,"This product took minutes to assemble and is a very sturdy trampoline. I've already lost 10 pound in 3 weeks!The jumping surface feels a bit greasy when jumping barefoot, but not so much that it allows the jumper to slip.Since then it's been moved about the room and I've found that one of the legs has come a little loose, like it's not manufacuturally threaded correctly. I'll have to use some ""locktight"" to secure it.All around it's be a really fun way to shed the pounds and stimulate the lymph system!"
5,I think it's great!,The trampoline came right away--earlier than I expected--and it was so easy to assemble! I had my kids jumping on it in no time. I can jump on it too--it's very sturdy. Looks nice--I have no complaints. Seems to be worth every penny!
4,Trampoline review,The trampoline arrived in very good shape with the all the pieces. My husband and son enjoy it very much and we have had no problems.
1,Designed Obsolescence,"Although I love the watch, the invariable need to replace the band every year and a half (or less) is a pain. I have a hard time believing Timex Ironman watches could suffer from this same problem for such an extended period of time w/o Timex addressing it. I have found that taking the pins out often damages the soft plastic to the point that the watch will no longer hold the pins, requiring the purchase of a new watch. I'm done w/ this product."
3,"Darn hard to install, but worth it","The design of the Timex watch and watchband makes it very difficult to replace the watchband. Even with the provided tool, getting the spring bar to slip into place is pretty difficult. However, your choices are limited. Once, I replaced the watch band on my Timex Ironman with a generic alternative. I was able to install it easier, but the band didn't flex or fit quite right with the way the watch is designed, and I had to replace it with this Timex brand original.It takes me ~30 minutes to replace the watch band. I've done this a few times over the last 5 years, and I feel like I'm getting better at it. It's worth replacing the band rather than buying a new watch if you have the patience to replace the band yourself."
1,Not what was advertised.,"Advertised as ""the"" replacement band for the ironman watch. It was a knockoff that did not fit correctly and I threw away or was not able to make it work as it would cost more to return than my time to return."
1,"Through the ""back"" door","After spending what seemed hours trying to put on the new band, I tried taking off the metal back of the watch (as you would if changing the battery). Once this is done it is easy to get the band on and secured. When putting back on the metal back cover, you simply slide it under the two pieces of plastic on each strap that extend over part of that metal backing and then replace the screws. Be careful of the little spring coming out of the watch when slipping the backing on again. It is easier to do that if the spring is on the near side of the watch rather then the far side as you slide the cover across(otherwise you may slice off the spring which may mean getting a new watch after all despite all that hard work). Good luck!!"
3,Tough Installing,"The band is as marketed. The band came with instructions and a tool to put it on yourself. I tried my best to get it on, but had to pay a watchmaker $5 to do it for me."
3,Iron Man patients to install,"Extremely difficult to instal, lbut from what I read on other people's comments, was expecting that.I was succesful using mini screwdriver."
5,Watchband,"This was a present for my husband, he was very sentimental that the watch went to Kuwait with him and was still working when horsing around the band broke. He was upset then very happy I was able to fix it quickly."
1,"handy man special, and short life","It is not a perfect fit. I removed some material to put the band on. the life of the band is pretty short too. That probably because I did not remove enough material so some stress exist near the connector.If you consider yourself a handy man, with a sharp knife and steady hand, go ahead get this one. Make sure the final result is a rather loose fit to the watch. If you are handy enough, you will figer out where to cut..."
5,If You Forget What It's All About,"My wife and I predict this will be a classic--it's back to the basics on what Christians must focus on to get meaning out of everything else. If you've forgotten about the ""wonder"" of what a daily walk with God looks and feels like, stop everything, order this book--and get ready to change course. This is beautifully written, with crisp, original ""you know he's right"" thinking. Warning: this will cost you! You'll end up sending the book to your friends. (I've already sent it to more than 25 people!)"
2,"Upon wearing this set, I cannot say much for it.","I liked this set well enough BEFORE I wore it, but I cannot say much for it now. First of all, the material is so thin you can nearly see through it. (I had hoped the material would feel like silk or satin, but it doesn't.)Secondly, if I wanted to order more sets I would be stuck, because the colors are so old fashioned and out-dated..black was the only one I could live with.When I put this set on and looked in the mirror, I felt 20 years older and looked awful. In fact, I think I will give this set to my great aunt who turns 91 in April.As for the size, I ordered Large because I like my pajamas loose-fitting. Somehow the top fits like an X-Large, and the bottoms fit more like a Medium and the cut is not quite right."
3,real country style,"We live in a metropolitan 30 story building and would like to bring in a relaxed feeling to our daily life. This book offers a calm and rural style from traditional mediterrean country houses.If you are looking for something with rich colors or delicate textures, you may be dissapointed. But if your are looking for real meditterean country house or old houses with old woods and decorations, this is certainly a book that you want."
5,Incomparable,"I agree with the other positive reviewers. The Ashkenazy bashing is unwarranted. For those who consider him a piano playing machine, just listen to this collection and be stunned. Ashkenazy plays very true to the music put on the page, which I often find refreshing. Many times I enjoy more 'interpretive' pieces; however, I imagine that Ashkenazy's playing is closest to what the composers actually imagined and intended.This is a beautiful and talented collection including Rachmaninov's sonata #2 and the beautifully played preludes. This deserves a place in any Rachmaninov fan's library."
4,Great Price for Rachmaninov Great Preludes,"For the price this a very good collection to own to complete your collection of the Rachmaninoff preludes. Although you will find better individual performances of the preludes from pianists such as Moiseiwitsch, Ogdon, or Cliburn, you will not find many complete sets of the preludes. Ashkenazy handles them all well, and in addition he performs the 2nd sonata. For the 2nd sonata I don't think you cant surpass Horowitz, but this set for the works is worth the low price by a one of the great pianists of our time."
5,Rachmaninov - the complete preludes,"In this Double Decca recording, Vladimir Askenazy gives us a fine interpretation of the complete sets of Preludes by Sergei Rachmaninov. The Preludes were published in three sets. The earliest - and the first of Rachmaninov's published pieces for the piano - was the second movement of the five pieces comprising his Op.3 of 1892. The second set of 10 Preludes, Op.23 appeared in 1903 and the final set of 13 pieces, Op.32, was published in 1910. The Op.3 piece is one of the most popular pieces Rachmaninoff composed.In addition to the preludes, the CD is completed by a performance of the Sonata No.2 of 1913, which was revised in 1931. All of these pieces are so thoroughly characteristic of Rachmaninov's romantic music, beautifully played by Ashkenazy."
1,Still waiting on my holders,I ordered this product over a month ago and still haven't received them. They will not answermy e-mails. (I've sent four....3 to amazon and one to them) They have just ignored them.I had to wait until the 26th. to have my credit card cancel and refund my payment.Very poor service !
5,I LOVE THESE!,"These pot hangers are fantastic! They hold strong and make my front property look absolutely adorable, adorned with terra cotta pots and bright yellow flowered plants! The shipping was incredibly fast...even to Alaska where everything takes twice as long to arrive. I loved these so much that I ordered 6 more hangers. My house is going to be covered in flowers! Yay for spring!"
1,Tire Repair,"Radial Tire Patch KtRubber patchs were ok ,however rubber cement included in kit did not get sticky to cement patch to tire.buffed area of hole before applying however cement pulled away from rubber of tire and patch did not bond to tire.redid patch using spray adhesive and patch appears to have bonded to tire. Would not purchase again or recommend."
1,"Nice sound, hurt my ears","I couldn't keep these headphones on for more than five minutes before my ears started hurting. They just didn't fit me well. I gave them to my husband, and they fit him just fine. The sound is good, but I guess the fit is very individual."
4,"Great Sound, Moderatly Uncomfortable","Considering the price, and the type of headphones, these are a great buy. The sound quality is significantly above average for this type. My only complaint is, as has been stated before, they tend to pinch the top of the ears, but its really only noticable during prolonged use."
2,Greatly Disappointed,"Sound needs to be ""burned in"" (sounds terrible at first but gets better)VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. The spacing between the plastic and the speaker pad is about .5 cm, so it is far too tight with a pointed corner. I was overjoyed to see the reviews for comfortable street style headphones, but don't take your chances with these.THEY JUST LOOK WEIRD. In the picture, they look small, which would be cool. However, the side plates are the size of drink coasters. My sister told me I look like spock when I wear them.ALTHOUGH the cord is nice and the headphones fold, these headphones are DEFINITELY not worth it. Look elsewhere.LISTEN TO ME! Don't take your chances with these!"
2,Hurts and rubs your upper ear,"I can't believe all the raving reviews.. The design of this headset inevitably rubs both your ears where the plastic piece literally pinches your skin after a while.I think the cord is sturdy and well designed. They are light and the sound is okay.. but like one reviewer said: ""The part that slips over the ears rubbed just enough to make my ear red and uncomfortable.""Certainly with exercise and all the running or jumping and sweating it is VERY IRRITATING to the ear skin.I'D NOT RECOMMEND THIS HEADSET."
2,Not Adjustable,"The hard plastic band that goes around the back of the head is not adjustable, and it does not conform to or fit the head very well. A sliding, adjustable band would have been a better design for a more secure fit. The loose fit makes these a poor choice for active wearers."
4,Pretty good headphone ...,"Sound is excellent. Only complaint is that it is not the most comfortable headphone to be wearing over an extended period because it stays on your head via tension. After a while, you need to release the tension to take some pressure off your ears."
5,Great!,"I'll make this short and sweet. I've had these headphones for years and not a thing has happened to them except the earpads giving out. Thanks to Amazon, I'm about to order a replacement set. I use these with my Nintendo 3DS and for listening to music on my laptop. These are a great pair of headphones and very comfy!"
5,Still great after three years of abuse,"I'm very picky about headphone comfort and I am extremely tough on them. I've abused the hell out of these since January 2007 and they still sound just as good as the day I bought them. I have a long history of breaking earpieces, stripping cords and causing fatal shorts in my headphones. I wear them constantly in all kinds of weather. I originally picked these because the price point was a perfect compromise between quality and price. I bought them expecting to replace them in a year or so. But it's been three years and they're still going strong."
4,Great Headphones for Everyday Use,I have been using these headphones for the past three years and I have to say that they are some of the best sounding over the ear headphones out there. These headphones are very comfortable for extended periods of time and the sound quality is terrific with a deep bass. The cord is covered with a braided material that helps it from getting knotted up. The only downside is that it has a spongy material that covers the speakers and during workouts they get soaked with sweat. If you are doing any running and get very sweaty I would recommend you look at the sweat proof headphones out there. Otherwise this is a great set of headphones for everyday use.
3,not as good as Sennheiser PMX60,The design and the no tangle cord rates 5/5 but the quality isnt as good as the Sennheiser PMX60 which i bought and compared at the same time. Sony sounds like its behind a wall compared to the crystal clear PMX60. the Sennheiser PMX60 feels really cheap but its a lot more comfortable to wear than the MDR-G74SL. Im keeping the Sennheiser PMX60.
3,Audio quality not great - Brendel speaks in German,"Playing by Brendel is excellent, but be aware this video was created during the 70s, and unfortunately the audio recording quality shows that. You just don't get the full resonance of a grand piano, as you do with more recently recorded CDs and DVDs. I also found it disappointing that for the pre-performance commentary Brendel reads from a prepared script and speaks in German. There are English subtitles available, but reading those off the screen as Brendel reads them in German off a piece of paper didn't convey much personal flavor to what he had to say."
1,3 weeks until it ships - & I can't cancel,"Do not order batteries from Amazon LLD, you order then 2 days later you cannot cancel, but you will not recieve them for over 3 weeks, this is wrong!."
1,Would give 0 stars if I could,"I opened the battery tonight for the first time taking it out of the package after buying it in April 2011, and it's dead. I see now the vendor sold me a battery with 2006 expiration date - so lesson to you, check date as soon as it arrives!"
3,cheaper at local wal-mart,should have looked at wal-mart first i guess cheaper to buy a twin pack there then to buy one from here
5,A 6 volt legend.,"Long before Copper Tops, Lithium, and a host of other ""super"" materials, there were these! Plain, simple, and oh, so sufficient! There are still several Flashlights and Beacon lanterns that require these special 6 Volt Batteries. There's simply no need to spend triple price when these beauties will do just fine. Ray-O-Vac has been supplying the Battery needs of our great Nation at a fair price for Decades! Well built and ready, these Batteries will power up the classic style lights and not drain one's wallet!"
3,Right on par for Ray-o-Vac,"It works, but of course underperforms Duracell and Energizer. It was cheap, and allowed me to go over $25 for free shipping. I can say that I got more value from the battery than I would have paying for shipping. If you have a 6v flashlight, it's not a bad filler item to avoid paying for shipping."
4,its o.k,"this is a like the original bruce li movie. its cool but he has done better movies the fight scenes are o.k,the best is at the end."
3,Bethenny Ever AFter- again,"ONce again, this was convenient and time-consuming, but in a good way. Don't rent this if you are busy, because bad reality television tends to suck you in until you've seen the whole season. Also, the sound quality could have been better."
1,Disappointing...,"I really had to push myself into finishing the book instead of throwing the book against the wall in frustration.Why? Because the book offered gems like ""Manage your cash. Startups in the bubble years burned through money, but companies today have to be run much more tightly.""I got the sense that the authors were just trying to fill the pages when same quotes were used 2 or 3 times across different chapters like a high school student trying to pad a book report.Intriguing title but ultimately the authors just served up rehashed conventional wisdom."
3,Interesting...,"Never before have I encountered music quite like this... It's very hard to even describe it. Atmospheric with elements of industrial is all i can think of. This CD is very long... Nearly 80 minutes. Yelworc has incredible talent when it comes to making music.. but when it comes to vocals.. thats another story. Thats why i gave this only 3 stars.. had it not been for the terrible vocals this CD would easily get atleast 4 stars. The music itself makes you feel like your in some village of the middle ages that is under attack.. which is a good thing. Such moody music is hard to find these days. However, like i said before.. the vocals just ruin some of the songs."
4,A Worthwhile Purchase,"This is a terrific book that my daughter returns to again and again. The illustrations are so interesting and layered with detail--you can find something new to appreciate and discuss however many times you read it. For example, there must be two dozen types of birds shown--flamingos, pelicans, chickadees, woodpeckers and more--just in the background. So there are lots of things to look at and talk about above and beyond the storyline, which focuses on zookeepers. I'm back at Amazaon to find something new by the same illustrator. Relationships between between animals and humans are shown in interesting ways. Noticibly non-sexist and non-classist. This book offers so much more than your typical board book. Enjoy it!"
3,Essential for Mormon Studies fans,"I like each of the three main Mormon studies journals (Journal of Mormon History, BYU Studies are the other two), and Dialogue is my favorite (I regularly read all three). The academic articles are double-blind peer-reviewed, and I find them consistently interesting and occasionally challenging. I enjoy the art, fiction and personal essay sections, and sometimes even like a poem or two. Part of Dialogue's value comes from its status as an independent journal. Though it doesn't appear to seek controversy (and sometimes, IMHO, seems to try too hard to avoid it), when dealing with controversial socio-theo-political issues, the Journal tries to seek out multiple sides of an issue. Dialogue publishes a fair number of articles on Mormon history, but those if you are interested in purely the history side of Mormon Studies, the Journal of Mormon History would be the first thing to subscribe to."
1,"Merely a Voice for ""Mormon Liberals""","If this journal were honest, it would not try to pretend to be a journal of Latter-day Saint scholarship. It is not. Rather, it is merely a voice for self-styled ""Mormon Liberals."" I personally have no regard for anything that comes from the minds of Mormon Liberals, no matter how annotated their narratives are, or how sophisticated their constructs. How can a faithful Latter-day Saint have any affection for a journal that publishes pieces from known apostates, and expose's of the sacred temple endowment? Mormon Liberals demand that everything must square with their intellect. Their intellect is their god, and Mormonism their hobby. Attend one of their symposia and try to breath the air; it is thick with the arrogance of the intellectual elite--the ""best and the brightest."""
2,Would not buy again,"When it arrived, one of the ports didnt work. I dont know if this is common with Netgear products, but this one is not worth the price. Will not buy this brand again. Going with Cisco."
3,It's fine for old technology,"I ended up mistakenly ordering this, instead of a gigabit switch. Mostly my fault, but not what I wanted. Oops."
1,FS-108 Has A Small Backplane That Causes Long Delays.,Netgear's switch can use a larger backplane. I put this switch to the test and found that it cannot support my busy network. I called technical support for assistance and received a rep. who told me that I needed another switch because the backplane found in the FS-108 is not big enough for my network. If it cannot support 8 computers - Why build an 8-port switch? This is a waste of money and time!!!
4,works should have got a faster one.,"Easy to install. Technical support is always there at Netgear. Email or on the phone.Made to many changes at one time, if I only changed one thing at a time would have saved lots of time."
5,Nice Switch!,"This is a great product. I would highly recommend it. You can easily put it anywhere. Never had any problems with it. Nice form factor, and great LEDs to let you know what is going on with it."
5,Simple Plug and Play,"Nice little Ethernet switch box. No set up required. Just plug it into an Ethernet network. It appears to work just as advertised; I can transfer files between computers at near 100 Mbps. Note that although the model number has remained FS108, my newer box purchased Mar-2002, has a small power brick and runs nice and cool. I had an older FS108 that had a way bigger power brick and ran hotter than you would expect, as mentioned in earlier reviews."
5,Why buy Netgear over Linksys?,...I ordered a Netgear FS-108 which worked perfectly out of the box and has continued to work without one single hitch ... I'm about ready to buy another Netgear unit and the warranty ... is five years on the Netgear versus one on Linksys.
1,poor and worse,This 3 gal. sprayer will not seal around the neck. It was just purchased and it is a flop. Go else where to purchase a product that will work.
5,Moses Maimonides Rediscovered,Moses Maimonides: The Man and His Works by Herbert A. Davidson (Oxford University Press) offers a thorough survey of the life and writings of this most influential Jewish thinker. The work gives a refreshing account of his life and influence with a close survey of all existent writings. In the process some surprising facts about his life and times come to the fore as well as some common myths are dispelled. Important for beginners and scholars alike.
4,Practical,"This is an understated, practical and nice everyday watch. It is feminine with a clean finish. I wear this watch to work and on weekends. I wash dishes and do other chores while wearing it - and not a scratch or water damage."
4,"""Gomen nasai""-Slow paced action","""Gomen nasai"" translates to ""I'm sorry"". I was dissapointed in the first volume of the new series because the first four episodes where all repetitive, everyone met up again and apologized to eachother for half an hour.This tape was also a bit of a let down because there was very little action. There was the introduction of a few new characters and the beginning of a slow plot started to form.I gave this tape the four stars, though, for the ultra-kawaii (cute) first episode. You see some of the backgrounds of Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu.If you are only looking for the action in Rayearth, this tape is not for you, if you are like me and have to get every single tape in the series, not matter how borring, then this is your tape."
3,Ayn Rand Answers,"It wasn't a bad book and it is probably worth reading, but it held nothing new or thoughtworthy. The answers seems a bit ""sanitized"" from what I remember."
4,Insightful,"This is an easy read. Rand's answers are comprehensive and interesting. The reader also gets to see a part of her personality which is valuable considering she has passed on. I wish I could have met her, but I'll have to settle for reading her interviews and Q&A's instead."
3,"Interesting, but it gets old","This is a good book to gain some insight as to how Rand's theory would work in the real world, but it does get old. The first half of the book is much better than the second half when she gets asked about music, movies, the arts, etc. I love Atlas Shrugged, The Fountainhead, and objectivism, but after a while I found myself saying okay lady, ""lighten up."""
4,Leave VMS behind?,"A little weird. VMS, excuse me, OpenVMS, is at best a stable niche, if not actually declining. The only people using it should be those with legacy applications running atop it. By contrast, linux is experiencing massive growth worldwide, for servers, and even on desktops.But as a practical matter, there still are clusters of OpenVMS machines, which nowadays probably have linux machines in them. So interoperability would be nice. Somewhat like how Samba lets Microsoft and linux/Mac/unix machines see each other and access each others' data on a LAN. Here, the author explains how to get the linux and OpenVMS machines to cooperate.With any luck, VMS readers of this book might learn enough about linux to eventually migrate their applications to it. That is, if they want to have a more promising career path."
4,Impactful Book,"I bought this book ""used"" and was pleased with it's condition. There are a few highlighted marks. I bought this book to use as part of a book study, and have been impressed with the content. The book is easy to read, and creates awareness of the secret places in peoples hearts for God. I would recomend this book to others."
5,LIFECHANGER,"Aside from the Bible, this book has had the single most profound effect in my walk with God. LIFE CHANGING BOOK that I buy for everyone I know. You would be crazy not to read it."
5,An ABSOLUTE MUST READ...,I am not moved by the various amounts of books I read to ever leave feedback but I am not even half way through this book and I cannot believe how profound it is! I wish I had gotten it sooner - definitely a blessing and will leave you begging for more quality time with God daily!
5,meditative,Read contemplatively to appreciate the depth. Many ideas to help one draw closer to Christ.
5,This book changed my life and others' lives forever.,"I first got this book as a Christmas gift from my high school youth group mentor. Every night I would read one of the short chapters from the book (they are only about 3 pages on average!) and then read a passage in my Bible. The book showed me how crucial it is to spend time with God, and it motivated me and gave me good techniques to make sure that I was communicating with Him daily.I recently bought many copies of this book for my discipleship team (small group), and many of my brothers and sisters are being inspired to communicate with God. The Bible is the most direct way God will ever speak to you, because every word in it is God-breathed.The vast majority of Christians do not read the Bible on a daily basis. So where are we getting out truth from? If you are having a hard time getting in the Word on a consistent basis, this book will be great for you. It's well worth the very small amount of time and money you will spend on it."
5,Secrets of the secret place,This is a great book to read for your devotion it will help your prayer life! read and enjoy and grow in the Lord.
1,NO!!!!!!!,"Here's another ripoff from the greedy scumbags at Columbia. This is an import, featuring 10 of the songs Marvin released on the Columbia label. This is an absolute ripoff. If you want a compilation, seek out 'Playlist: The Very Best of Marvin Gaye,' which sums up the Columbia years as well as any collection can for Marvin. Or, do it the right way and buy 'Midnight Love,' 'Dream of a Lifetime' and 'Romantically Yours.' That way, you can truly have Marvin's complete Columbia releases. Avoid this and every other collection Columbia or Sony releases at all costs.NOT RECOMMENDED."
1,Terrible Movie,This is the worst movie I've watched in a long time! The acting was awful and the plot was very lame. I'm not usually this harsh but this was really bad.
3,Uneven but somewhat enjoyable.,"While it's not nearly as bad as the IMDb rating would suggest (1,9/10 as of this writing), ""Phat Girlz"" is a very uneven movie. At times it's cute, but the screenplay should have been rewritten and the plot tightened up; the pace slows down too much at times, especially in the middle of the movie.The main character, Jazmin, is at times too rude to get the viewer's sympathies. She doesn't like being picked judged by the way she looks, but she tends to be equally shallow when judging others. Mo'Nique gives all she's got, and her fans will enjoy her performance. The rest of the cast is not very good with the exceptions of Jack Noseworthy and Eric Roberts's cameo.Overall, ""Phat Girlz"" is a slightly-below-average comedy which is likely to appeal mostly to people who sometimes feel bad about being overweight."
4,Thumbs Up to the Phat Girlz,"I will admit I was skeptical about this movie, Monique can sometimes push the envelope with the ""fat"" thing. However, I was pleasantly surprised, this movie was funny and inspiring. Although Monique's character Jasmine coming out on top at the end was predictable it was good to see images from movie land that don't depict overweight woman as hopeless, and unattractive. This movie is a good choice for a girls night of movie watching or anytime you want a good laugh."
3,"""Phat Girlz"" Has Its Moments","This movie is corny and inconsistent, but that's what makes it funny (my favorite scene was when Jasmine was at the burger joint). Jasmine was too emotional and overreacted at times, almost to the point of becoming aggressive. Since she had boxing gloves at home, you would've thought she'd take some type of kickboxing class to help her release frustration and lose the weight at the same time. Anyway, the message being reiterated throughout the movie is for big girls to love their bodies, have more confidence, and go for their dreams. That's a good message (for any woman), but being overweight is still a health issue (diabetes, difficulty walking, asthma, HBP, etc.). Nothing funny about that."
2,CHEESY,At times this movie was funny. But the plot was all over the place and there were parts that were so corny I was like come on. I felt the main character felt too sorry for herself and was mean and spiteful to some of the other characters. Anyway black men like fuller figures so I didn't understand why she felt it so hard that this gorgeous doctor was in love with her. But overall the movie did have a very postive message.
4,Hilarious!,This movie shows Monique at her best. It had a great storyline and recognizes full figured women! A-
5,GREAT FOR USED ITEM!,"I was very pleased with the swiftness of delivery. There were no lags in viewing, no scratches. Have had very good response to getting used movies. Would purchase from this vender again."
5,Siva Yajna,"It was exactly what I asked for. Perfect. Great condition. It came on time, and there were no issues with price or money. It is a great book to practice with. Om Namah Shivaya!!!"
3,"good and quite helpful, but be careful","There are many points in the book where it encorages us to be fully persuaded for Jesus and His gospel.. but then the author goes round and round and beats around the bush about his assumptions and his pet doctrines he cannot let go etc, and his merciless attack on christians who oppose his doctrines..the author clearly love the Lord, and in his zeal, like many other christians, tear apart fellow beleiver in areas in which they have superior understanding/interpretation.. in this way, the author digs his own grave in many places..i would carefully select few chapters and give it out to people to read from the internet. this book may not be a worthwhile investment for me to give to any zeaalous christian, but only for a few."
3,"Nearly $1,000 to buy this book-REALLY?","I did not want to vote for this book because I have not read it but something about the tittle grabbed me. The title is credible because the bible warns us that in the last days there will be apostasy. You can see this now esp. with so many people labeling themselves Christians who are chasing materialism, money and the Prosperity Teachers who feed into their lust for money. Ever notice how the message that God wants you rich gets people whipped into an emotional frenzy when the message of the sacrificial blood Jesus shed on his cross and living holy & conduct hardly incites a whimper of response? We need more books reminding us of what the bible said about the last day Apostasy because it is written that it will take place."
4,Grounded in the KJV Bible,"This book is probably best suited for mature Christians who already know the Word and have a relationship with Jesus Christ. It is a fascinating book. Lots of insights about motives and heresies in churches today. As with all books proclaiming the ""Truth""...use discernment."
3,The Great Dream,"This is an interresting book and gives much food for thought. It was written in a very opinionated, blunt manner. I reccommend that you read it, and ignore the bias in it. You may be awakened to what is going on in the world."
1,Confused and prone to wandering,"I wrote an extensive critique of this work as it appears online at tektonics.org (under heading, ""Apostasy Now""). Despite some ""even a broken clock is right twice a day"" points, The Great Dream is overall a worthless tour de force of mangled exegesis. The author is manic, paranoid, and doesn't think of anything beyond his limited world of experience.""The Great Dream"" is the inevitable result when a Christian consumes spiritual Twinkies rather than meat. Read my extensive critique before you give this lunatic your money."
3,"ladida, ladida","Why is it that French horns can never play in tune with each other or the rest of the orchestra? Why, Why, Why!? If not for the french horns, this would be a very nice recording. These concertos are much cooler with the original instumentation, tho."
2,Rather dull and boring,"Out of all the recordings of the Brandenburgs available, I can not fathom any reason to buy this set. It is the most boring recording I own of these works. I can't give it only one star because it is Bach's music, which can never be completely ruined by a poor conductor, so I'll grudgingly give it two stars.If, for some odd reason, you really want a modern instrument recording, there are better choices out there (such as the Marriner dics on Phillips). To appreciate this music, though, I recommend a period instrument (aka PI) recording such as the Trevor Pinnock or Gustav Leonhardt recordings. Modern instruments do NOT reflect the sound-world that Bach intended.In short, I have tried repeatedly to listen to this Britton set, but each time I end up turning it off thinking ""I paid money for this?"" and putting on ANY other conductor's interpretation."
4,Palm VII Nice but too Bulky,"I have the Palm V but wanted the Palm VII. So, I bought it, got connected to the internet and it was really cool/neat/great! However, the SIZE of it was just too bulky. I felt like I was carrying a copy of War and Peace in my suit coat. I have written to 3COM to find out if they plan to make the Palm 8 or 10 or 12 or whatever--just so it's more sleek like the Palm V. Great device, but I plan to wait a year to see if a ""sleeker"" one comes out."
2,Too Old,"This used to be a great device. However, as of Aug. 31, 2004, Palm is discontinuing their Palm.Net wireless service. As the Palm VII cannot be reconfigured to use a different service, the vast majority of its functionality is now gone. If you just need a basic handheld, the Palm VII will still work in this capacity, but there are other devices which work just as well for a lower cost."
1,unless you own stock in Duracell forget it,"this was the second Palm I owned, and was a closeout model, and it was terrible. Battery life is non-existent unless one week counts. In fact was away from unit for a week and not only were the batteries completely dead, but lost all data. I love the convenience of a PDA, just not THIS PDA"
3,Too much money,Take a look at HPJornada for 500 bucks. It is in color with same functionality and 8 times more RAM. Wireless access burns batteries fast and it is outrageously expensive. Monochromatic screen drives me crazy. Should have bought HP.
4,More pearls from an accomplished master,"Larry Coryell is one of the most gifted guitarists alive. Throughout his career he has shared his thoughts and ideas on his playing and his approach to solving problems or issues particular to jazz interpretation and improvising that he was dealing with. I don't think his contributions to the educational world are for beginners. This book is for an intermediate to advanced player. Providing you have some experience and knowledge under your belt, Larry's tips are fantastic and above all useable right away in your playing. I've admired his work for 25 years and this offering is another great piece of work, added to many others, that Larry has produced. His acoustic albums Standing Ovation and European Impressions (which I think is partially available on the Tributaries CD) are seminal works for me and even after twenty years bear repeated listening for more amazing things created by this master."
1,Zero Stars,Larry has the chops but simply can't teach effectively either in books or in videos. I am not going to waste anymore money on his stuff. I advise you to look this book over in a music store first before deciding to buy it online.
1,watertight?,"If you want your data to be secure it has to be protected from fire, theft and (duh) water. Ask yourself how the fire dept. puts out a fire? There is NO MENTION of watertightness in the brochure or ads for this product. Looks like there is an interior seal of some kind but not a seal on the outer lid, but the absence of any mention of water protection in the marketing materials makes me think: NO (I don't own the thing).Ok, an otterbox 3500 would seem to fit inside to provide some water protection, but that would further reduce the space available. My 3.5"" external drives will fit in the mediavault, but not the otterbox. Ok, buy some 2.5"" drives I guess.Theft protection? Fergit it. This only weighs 75 lbs and has just a basic lock.1 out of 3 ain't bad right? Well ... is 1 hour enough? Too expensive for too little protection."
3,Smells like Teen Spirit (sort of),"I agree with the previous review - Catcher in The Rye does come to mind. But Lost Between Houses falls short matching the Salinger classic. In fact, the novel read like a comic book at times. True to the cover notes though, the ending is very surprising and represents the best writing in the book. A good, light cottage read."
4,The Cabbage Patch,"The Addy Short Stories aren't as good as the big books, but they are good. This Addy book touched my heart and I wanted to read it again. Addy, a young black girl who lived in the time of the Civil War, has a mystery to solve. Her friend, Sarah Moore has a cousin who is instantly a magnet to Addy's big brother, Sam. Her own brother doesn't seem to have any time for her! Why is Daniel acting hurt and mysterious? It's up to Addy to solve this mystery."
3,Meh . . .,"I used Mounce's Basics of Biblical Greek, which I thought was excellent. I bought the graded reader at the same time so that I could start diving in the New Testament. The way that he selects the various texts in the book is great -- starting with passages that are easy to read and then progressing to harder passages. He includes text from the Didache and Psalms (LXX) to get students outside of the NT as well, which is a plus.Overall, though, I am not sure how valuable this text really is for the extra money spent. Students can certainly find the Greek texts online that will be linked to a lexicon. This will not, of course, have many of the additional notes that Mounce provides in his text, but to be honest I didn't find these as useful.If the cost of the book isn't an issue, it is certainly is of help. If you don't want to spend the extra money, there are ways to get this kind of practice without doing so."
3,Good to Great,"This is a good workbook in the beginning or intermediate level. When your study covers ""beyond basics"" this will become rudimentary to you. But that does not mean we can just skip the basic stuff. There is also a good review for basic grammar in different approach:HANDBOOK OF NEW TESTAMENT GREEK an Inductive Approach Based on the Greek Text of Acts (Two Volume Set)"
3,Hard as a rock,"I bought this wedge pillow thinking that it would be good for reading or watching TV in bed. Unfortunately, the pillow is much harder/firmer than I expected. While the angles are okay, I don't find it comfortable at all. You might as well be leaning against a piece of plywood. Perhaps it will soften over time, but I'm not putting out much hope..."
5,Excellent for any mother who has lost a child,I bought this book for the mother of my precious Makayla Zayne who touched our lives for a mere 33 hours. What an inspiration to know she lives on in heaven and that she is very happy there even when we miss her sooooo much. We look forward to the day we will be reunited with her. This book tells how happy our babies are in heaven and that we have nothing to worry about. Grandma loves you Makayla Zayne.
5,"Beautiful, a true comfort!","I bought this for a friend who delivered a stillbirth child. This book will bring healing to your heart and soul. I think it's one of the best books for moms who miscarried / had a child who died shortly after birth / had an abortion and is suffering from the grief and guilt, etc.I cried and cried when I read this book, it's very touching..."
4,Great!,"This is a great book!I have already read this book more than 3 times last 2 weeks.I suggest it to everyone who had experienced the stillbirth or miscarriage.I found that this book makes me calmer and happier.The pictures are nice and words are so simple but good chosen.If I ever have a child in the future, I will read this book and he/she will know that her/his brother is in the heaven and one day we will be all together again.However, almost all the pictures in the book are related to girls(baby girl).It can be disappointing for the ones who lost their son as myself.Also my special thanks to Amazon to deliver me this book in 1 week time, although I live in Europe."
5,Amazing,"I bought this book shortly after losing our first daughter, 40 minutes after her birth. It brought as much comfort to me as it did tears. 6 years later, i still have it. I bring it out on her birthday or anytime that I feel the need to have a really good cry because I am missing her so much."
4,Beautiful Book,"My daughter was stillborn on 09-11-07. I was looking for something comforting and this book hits the spot. The illustrations are gorgeous, I like to imagine at least one of them looks like my daughter would when she got older. The simple wording is touching to read. I usually start off reading it and crying more, but by the end I am comforted and quieted thinking of my angel baby in Heaven."
3,This book is only good if you believe in Jesus,"The idea behind this book is good and I imagine this would be a helpful book for parents who have lost a child - IF AND ONLY IF those parents believe in Jesus. I would encourage people of a different religious faith to steer away from this book as the references to Jesus Christ our Savior will probably make non-believers uncomfortable. For those comfortable with those references, this book is heart-wrenching and may be helpful in coming to terms with a loss."
3,This book at first...,"put me off. I kind of didn't like the way it was being told through the eyes of a baby miscarried. That is just my feelings. Then Linda DeYmaz had in the back of her book verses from the bible on heaven. It was so thought provoking and I loved it. She put Bible verses in the back of the book that tells us about heaven and that is what she based her book on. Then I understood. It is nice to have someone pull out things like this. I agree with her that ""Heaven means more to me now and my apprehensions about death have been eased"" since my little babies died. I didn't know what to tell my boys when they would have anxiety over one of us dying also and thank you to this book I know what to tell my three boys about heaven and how heaven shouldn't be a scary thing. I didn't read the actual book to them but I did read the verses about heaven to them that she pulled out."
4,"The ""A- Head"" Is Classic","As an avid reader of the Wall Street Journal (can someone be an avid reader of a business newspaper) I always look forward to the funny middle section with my cup of coffee.Sometimes hysterical, other times sweet, and always fashioned prose, this collection captures some of the small bits of gold that sprinkle this paper everyday.This is a good book for a plane, bathroom, traffic jam, or for a laugh before bed. Each story is short and sweet as of course is the writing itself. A gem to be picked, twirled around, and enjoyed, each stroy is a unique facet.When finished, pick up the Journal, at least for the whymsical middle section."
2,Have a Glass of Water Handy When You Read This,"You'll need the water because this book is extremely dry. I'm not sure how the stories ""float"" off the page. Light is not a word I would use. There is a story about translating the Bible into Klingon. There is a possibility for humor or lightness but the author wrote it as strictly an infomational article. Another possibly funny story was about people who smoked venom from toads. Again, the writing style the author chose to use was dry. Most of the stories (that I read, which was about half) were similar, parlaying information in a straightforward manner without much humor or lightness in them-or just plain boring!"
5,A real sailor of the blue water Navy,"I couldn't lay this book down, once started. Ted Mason put me back in Hawaii during those dark days of 1940/41. He vividly describes how it was to be a sailor in the rigid ""pecking order"" of the ""Old Navy."" As a Pearl Harbor Survivor myself, he made that day come alive. More important, he reminded me of the days of the fleet at San Pedro in 1939. Read it if you have any interest in how it was to be a young bluejacket in the pre-war Navy."
3,good,"I found this to be the best book as far as having pictures to show how to do stretches and on good typing technique.Other books I would recommend are:`The Repetitive Strain Handbook by Robert M Simon, MD and Ruth Aleskovsky'.`The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook by Clair Davies'`Living Better Every Patient's Guide to Living with Illness by Carol j. Langenfeld'."
5,I don't get all the haters...,"This is one of the most realistic combat games I have come across. Unfortunately, for those who seem to hate this franchise, it can be a bit challenging at times. It may not be perfect but it is fun and the game lasts a long 14 levels that are very diverse and interesting. There are multiple ways to beat each different situation you come across and it is interesting to replay levels and try different strategies. I thought the AI was very good as well. If you can pick this up for $20 it is worth taking a chance on."
3,Fun game when played in short bursts,"Conflict global terror is a fun game, it's by no means perfect, but it is fun. I picked it up, because I wanted a decent tps for my pc, and I am satisfied with it. Conflict GT has a good variety of levels, they are all fairly long, but can become a bit tedious. The player can switch between the four man squad at any time so you get to use a good variety of weapons. While the weapons are fine, I would have liked to see a pregame weapon select menu. The games graphics are fair and the cutscenes look ok for the year this game was made. All in all, I give this game a 7/10 and would recommend it to any tps fan whose pc is not an extreme gaming rig."
3,Average for boat lift removal,"This winch has average power. I do not see much difference in torque compared to the 1000lb winch. Ok on flat areas, but as soon as there is an incline it bogs down. Wish there was a 2000-2500 model ."
3,Looked good,It wouldn't work for what we wanted. We where wanting to put it in the back of a 5th wheel toyhauler RV. It was suppose to pull our honda goldwing up a ramp but it had to big of a bend in the garage door and kept getting hooked so we sent it back. Would of been a great idea...back to the drawing board
3,Middle of the road dance,"This is a dance album with a commercial twist. Mekon invited some known artists in order to release an album that could be liked by a lot of people. The artists that were invited did influence the tracks quite a lot. In the case of the great (and only) hiphop song 'what's going on?' with shawn lee it worked out well. But if you listen to the tracks 'out of my soul' and 'please stay' your party will be ruined. Sometimes one track can save a cd, in this case these songs with Marc Almond are just plain horrible. The good side is that they are so incredible bad that the rest of the cd stands out. But to be honest, most of the songs are pretty straightforward and far from original."
3,Since Re-issued,"This has been re-released as Bird Alone, so Jack completists (who will want to have this) needn't hunt it down. As noted, it's an expanded version of Concert Classics."
3,(...),This is a repackage of the same concert as Live Vol 9. It includes 3 tracks not found on Live. It should have been labeled as a re-package (...)
5,Comfortable Fit Washes Well Too!,"I have a 13 lb. bichon, I purchased 5 of these..The thermal material keeps her warm in winter. They are true to size & they wash well. The legs are short, but long enough for most small dogs like bichons. I would recommend and I would purchase again"
5,Excellent,This is a wonderful work to listen to. I will listen to it again and again in long car rides. He has many profound insights into the Spirit and Science.
2,Not as good as his others,He seemed to just barely touch on many different subjects and did not go into enough detail.
2,Nothing special,I have listened to D. Chopra's books and they all seem to be the same. So after you have read one or two there is nothing new to be gained from additional readings.
5,Rumi's poetry is truly BEAUTIFUL,"I have read other translators of Rumi's books; however, Coleman Barks is by far my favorite. I have quite a few books of Rumi's spiritual poetic experiences, and I can only say that I wish I could have those experiences. Please read the one-derful Rumi books by Coleman Barks. Rumi is really inside of his heart and soul. The Essential Rumi is the one to have in your library of spiritual books."
2,Better off researching the Internet for free,"This book makes a lot of assumptions. Such as, you'll be using ZAP channels. If you are using SIP and/or IAX only, you'll quickly find yourself lost trying to follow the examples since a critical part of the setup is done in zapata.conf (i.e. a useless file for SIP/IAX only deployments). If you aren't using ZAP and you skip that part of the chapter (like I did), you'll pull out hair you didn't know you had trying to get the example configs to work. Likewise, the example builds out even further in the next chapter about extensions.conf, riddled with more ZAP configuration with a smattering of SIP examples. And if you are looking for IAX config examples you can forget it. Indeed it seems that SIP and IAX were after thoughts in this book.If you are looking to setup a more traditional PBX using hardware line cards and PRIs, then this book is for you. Otherwise, keep looking."
5,Tremendous introduction to Asterisk,"I picked up this book due to my interst in the telecom field. I was quite curious to see how this software base PBX can compare to today's Nortel and Avaya production PBXs.I am currently in the process of building my Asterisk PBX and see what its potential is. This book has guided me through the entire process. I must hand it to the authors, they took a step back and paid close attention to detail and the basics. However, the further you read on, you begin to really understand the capabilities of this powerful software.If you are a beginner or an advanced user, this book is surely to teach you something. Thank you to the authors who have opened my eyes to the breakthrough technology of VOIP."
1,Duh...What About Multiple Line Phones?,Isn't the concept of a multiple-line phone with blinking lights pretty fundamental to any office use? This book mentions nothing about it. There is essentially no information about how Asterisk interacts with phones. This really makes me wonder how the authors do it on their systems. It seems to me that how office phones are hooked up to the PBX unit is about 50% of the entire technical problem. The failure to cover this is difficult to comprehend.
1,Dated. Rambling.,"The asterisk software has progressed substantially, but worse, the organization of what's important and what's not makes this book hold the distinct honor of being in the top five worst books by O'Reilly Press."
4,Helpful,"This book really made me think about why I ""do what I do"" and ""say what I say"" to my child. I didn't agree with all the concepts but it did make me question my actions and make me respond more lovingly to my child."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this book hoping to get some advice on how to deal with kids (although my first baby isn't born yet). I wanted to be prepared. But, the author spends SO much time telling you how NOT to treat your kids, and I feel like much of what he says is common sense. I'd like to know HOW to deal with certain situations that may arise so that I can be prepared. To compare this book with it's polar opposite:Dare to Discipline by James Dobson, I find it interesting how BOTH authors approach children from the same standpoint, of finding out the motive behind a behavior and to approach discipline from a loving and respectful standpoint. (This is one thing I like about both books.) But, the approaches are totally different. The approach presented in this book lacks the specifics that I was looking for, especially age appropriate discipline. I'd be happier with an author who wasn't as vague as this author, and not as supportive of physical restraints as Dr. Dobson."
3,Nothing new under the sun,"Kohn does not understand the real nature of rewards. He is right when he criticizes the use of many rewards. However, none of his criticisms undermine the concept of positive reinforcement.Positive reinforcement is a wider concept than rewards. In fact the most important reinforcers are social interactions between people, i.e., the way you treat people. Whether you like it or not, you are changing the behavior of people all the time and vice versa by means of your social interactions (read positive reinforcement).Kohn is now advocating ""love and reason"". Well, he is advocating the correct use of positive reinforcement, that's it. In the final analysis Kohn is doing a great job of behavior shaping with his readers."
3,Made me think twice about everything,"A challenging but ultimately rewarding way to address issues in parenting. Ultimately this has good run on effects into everyday life. As with all things parenthood, this should be read with an open mind and critically assessed before deciding this philosophy is helpful to you. For me and my family it has been so far. :)"
1,Very Anti-Religious,"First of all, this book gives ideas that have absolutely no practical application. For example, he suggests that ideally you should never praise your kids, because they should learn to feel proud of themselves, not rely on your pride. Sure, they should feel proud of themselves, but aren't they more likely to just feel bad about themselves if they grow up with parents who refuse to hand out praise?More importantly to me, as a Christian parent, is the fact that he sites religion as one of the reasons parents these days are too conditional in his opinion. He actually states that the God of Christian and Jewish religion is the ultimate example of conditional love, and goes on to say that these religions teach God loves you only if you love him. I can't respect anything he has to say after reading that kind of nonsense."
1,Garbage,"Kohn is a hack, and a dangerous one at that. Parents and paraprofessionals of individuals with severe problem behavior who follow his musings do so at their own peril. Meanwhile, he laughs all the way to the bank."
2,I wish I hadn't read it,"This book has made me reflect on many aspects of my parenting.Unfortunately, it did so by making me feel guilty and berated. When I feel guilty and insecure, I become a worse parent - I fixate on my actions rather than on watching and responding lovingly to my child.While reading this book I felt as though I was being manipulated by the highly rhetorical style. Although it is at the complete opposite end of the spectrum to books likeOn Becoming Baby Wise: The Classic Sleep Reference Guide Used by Over 1,000,000 Parents Worldwide, at the end, i felt with both books as though unworkable advice was being shoved down my throat.I honestly wish I hadn't read it, because I can get the same parenting tips and information from other sources without the emotional baggage. TryNurtureShock: New Thinking About Childrenfor the same information about praise, for example."
5,"wonderful, fantastic and eye-opening.","this book is wonderful. I am re-reading it for the third time, and every time i am reminded how important it is to be a mindful, caring parent. How important it is not to dismiss your children's requests, needs, demands. I highly recommend this book to everyone."
5,It's about time! Every parent should read this book.,"Kohn does an exceptional job of making parents rethink their entire approach with children, and gives much healthier alternatives for everyone involved. In this book, he gives multiple reasons why this is necessary and gives multiples sources for every point he makes. He is a fantastic researcher and I'm thrilled that he's written this guide for parents. Even before reading the book, I have been practicing this form of parenting with my children and have seen firsthand how well it works."
1,Moronic and Irresponsible,"Is this why I have to put up with so many brats when I go out in public? Is this the same clueless fool who said you can't spoil a child? At least he admits one of his goals is to tear down the individualism this country is founded upon by replacing systems of rewards and punishment, and the goal of responsibility with navel gazing anarchy. Newsflash, author, we already have a society based on no parenting parenting, I shudder to envision a world of his making that is even more so."
1,Reality Check,"Kohn gives text book advice for text book situations. ""Kohn, how about joining the real world?""Unconditional Parenting: Moving from Rewards and Punishments to Love and Reason"
1,Carmen turned into Cavalleria Rusticana,"Yes, certainly, this is a TERRIBLE recording of Carmen, though others (Bernstein, Maazel and the digital Karajan) also have strong claims as the worst Carmen ever. This recording is typical of the early 60's, when Carmen was thought as the first verismo opera. Of course it isn't. Carmen is still a romantic opera, and owes a lot to both Offenbach and Gounod. Surprisingly, there are only 4 great recordings of Carmen> Abbado (DG), Beecham (EMI), Cluytens (EMI) and Solti (DECCA). If you want the best of all, it certainly is the Berganza/Abbado recording. They understand what Carmen is all about, and do it beautifully. The 1977 sound is still excellent (far batter than the digital Karajan recording for the same label). Surprisingly"
2,"Comically bad, except for Sutherland","This is probably the most godawful recording of ""Carmen"" ever made, but there are a few very sweet and lovely moments by Joan Sutherland as Micaela. You can probably get it in a discount bin somewhere if you want to hear Sutherland's sensitive rendering of ""Je dis"" or get a cheap laugh from the rest of the cast (Mario del Monaco as Don Jose is especially bad)."
3,It's taken 50 years to get to 3 stars,"I have spent all my adult life panning this recording. Nobody in this recording should have recorded the role they sang.Let's start with Dame Joan. I am a Sutherland fanaatic, but 1962 & 1963 were not good years, 2 of her biggest mistakes came from this time period - Mozart: Die Zauberflote - Königin der Nacht & Bizet: Carmen - Micala. It's not that she was bad; the roles were not her best. These are recordings that only true fanatics should buy.Regina Resnik was never a favorie of mine and this is definitely one of her best recordings. There are just too many other choices out there to waste time with this one.Mario del Monaco is even more italianate than Corelli, but his voice is not that beautiful. He has the subtility of a raging bull.Kraus is no Merrill or Ramey, enough said.I can only recommend this recording to people who like it. For others move on and shop around. 50 years have not really altered my opinion!"
2,Why wasn't Sutherland Carmen?????????????,"Okay, this Carmen is NOT good, not good at all. First of all, I found out about this in the Rough Guide to Opera. it listed it as one of the worst opera recordings ever. RIGHT!!! First of all, Regina Resnik as Carmen is plainly too thick to be convincing during many scenes. del Monaco, whom I love as Radames or in the Italian repertoire in general, is just not at home as Jose. Tom Krause, meanwhile, sounds similar to Resnik as Escamillo - thick, boring, and really uncomfortable down in the lower part of the range. Sutherland's Micaela was the only good thing- why couldn't SHE have been Carmen???????????"
2,Sutherland as CARMEN? Oh please!,I had a good laugh at the reviewer suggesting dearest Joanie for Carmen. Sutherland never had the chest-notes nor the dramatic powers needed for Carmen. The two stars are for Resnik's FIERY Carmen and partly for Joanie's pretty Micaela. Except for Regina and Joanie this recording is crap.
5,A Must own it for any enthusiatic cook!,"I was presented this book by my aunt when I got married. Since it had a lot of description about the regional cuisine of India,I started reading it as a storybook but slowly started trying out the recipies. Now I have Madhur's entire collection and have also watched her show on BBC! Her recipies bring out the authentic flavors of India and are easy to follow for beginners and pros alike! Kudos to madhur jaffery."
3,This is not a book,"If the title is right this is not a bool but the set of dices to play the game, they are your average plastic ten sided dices, six in blue and four in yellow for the ""Mega Attributes"" roll (in my experience this is not enough once the campaign catches steam and everybody is rolling twice that much for a single action). Useful if everyone buys their set, useless if it is the only dices you are planning to buy. By the way, they come inside a nice bag with the Aberrant logo on it."
3,Songs from the chicken coop,"If you like extended instrumental jams (mostly blues) seasoned with plenty of plump and juicy tones similar in style to Satriani you may enjoy this disc. Tunes like ""Too Many Humans"", ""Earth Heals Herself"" and ""Super Human"" offer some very tasty guitar riffs, but the title track, ""A Day Will Come"", and ""Clones"" are tedious. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that Buckethead is one of the best chicken-raised guitar players ever. His family should be proud!"
2,Poor recording quality,"This is a poorly done album. Buckethead jams on guitar and bass with a phenominal keyboardist and simple, methodical drummer on a bunch of tracks. Likely done in one to two takes each with little or no mastering. The tracks are then titled so that one would think the album had a point. If you want a backlog of buckethead material, this album will give you that. He still is certainly no slouch on guitar and that will be shown on this album. A bit more on the bluesy side than metal. No speed metal at all. I don't feel bad for owning it, but I wouldn't have bought it if I knew what was on it before hand. Worth about five dollars. Then I'd buy it."
5,Great Album. Great Guitarist.,"Buckethead has surely made up a name for himself over the past decade. It is hard to tell, however, if he draws more attention for the Bucket he wears on his head and mask on his face, or for the fretboard he so gracefully lights up. Sadly, I believe it is the first.Buckethead does an excellent job of fusing blues, rock, and hints of jazz into this album. His phrasing is beautiful, and proves himself much more worthy than mindless shredders of the past decade (i.e. John Petrucci). This man makes the guitar cry.There is not one song I do not thoroughly enjoy on this album, but if I had to choose a few standout tracks, they would be ""Too Many Humans"" and ""Earth Heals Herself"". I hope that in following years, that this album becomes influential to both guitarists and musicians around the world. Its a shame this artist is more often laughed at for his bucket, than praised for his virtuostic ability on the guitar. Five Stars. Easy."
3,Jam man band,"3 1/2Brilliant guitarist shows how, even when courting occasional rambling paths of layered soloing loneliness, his particularly strong combination of technical restraint continuously get the job done."
3,EW&F: In Concert,"The sound is great, but video quality very poor. The band sounds super. I would recommend EW&F Live in Japan, because it got much better video quality."
4,Lots of overdub but still is GREAT music,"I've watch this concert in VHS format while i was a little kid. I didn't notice back then that this concert had a lot of overdubs in it. It did dissapoint me a bit after I found out about the overdubs, but if you just ignore that a lot of the sound did not sync with the players movement, and just focusing on the sound of the MUSIC they produced, it's a GREAT piece of music anyway. I think one of the best they've made. And the live vibe is still there despite all the overdubs. So, appreciate the great music, and just enjoy the picture as a bonus..."
5,Satisfied,"During a visit from friends the other day, we partied this entire concert. The experience brought back memories and great conversation.Thank you Amazon."
3,good but 1/2 faked,"i'll keep this short and sweet. nice vid, good audio but lip sync'd on all harmonizing parts which detracts from enjoying this to it's fullest. but nice video over all."
3,Vive le boogie!,"Unlike many French bands, Ganafoul didn't really embrace the punk attitude of many of their peers (Trust, Shakin' Street etc.), opting instead for more traditional upbeat blues-rock. This is an early live document, and although only weighing in at about the half-hour mark it's nonetheless an enjoyable performance. Jack Bon's vocals display none of the uneasiness with English lyrics often associated with French singers, and the band in general sound tight and forceful"
3,"Nice toy, but doesn't ship well.","This toy was smaller than I realized. Pay close attention to the size dimensions. It also did not seem to ship well even in a box. The wire pieces were all bent out of place which made moving the beads difficult. The detail on the bottom also had several scratch marks on it. My one-year old nephew loves this toy, but I'm not sure how well it will hold up."
5,Great compact version of the original!,"We purchased this mini bead rollercoaster for our son's first birthday. He loves it! It keeps him entertained in his pack-n-play for quite some time. As his skills improve, I know he will continue to love pushing the beads around the wires. The qualities I like most about this product are its durability and size. This toy has already taken some beatings from our son and it still stands looking brand new. None of the wires seem loose or compromised in any way. Mostly, I love that it doesn't take up an entire room (like the counterparts you find in doctor offices), yet it is just as much fun."
3,Not a lot for your buck,Its not a bad item at all but for the money when you get you would think it should be double the size other than that it's a good toy I just think you can get more for your $
4,small for the price,"Overall my kids like to play with this toy.When I was purchasing the toy I didn't pay attention to the details of the toy. I am not sure if they listed the dimensions, but I was disapponted in the size. I was expecting it to be bigger for the price.Next time I will look for dimensions."
1,IF YOU WANT TO LEARN ABOUT ASTRONOMY AND COSMOLOGY DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"I am a professional astronomer. I can tell you that there are serious problems with Jerome Drexler's theory and I agree strongly with the review given by JMK. For anyone interested in Cosmology, Dark Matter and Dark Energy, there are much better books out there, books that pain a picture of a more generally accepted theory."
2,Out of the Mainstream,"This book presents a theory of dark energy that does not reflect mainstream thinking. Read THE EXTRAVAGANT UNIVERSE by Robert P. Kirshner for a more comprehensive and valid interpretation of dark energy and its relationship to dark matter.Ellen Jackson, authorTHE MYSTERIOUS UNIVERSE: SUPERNOVAE, DARK ENERGY, AND BLACK HOLES(A book for young adults)"
5,The long con...,"I've said it before and I'll say again, British cinema does more with less. Hustle is one of my favorite series. I've watched seasons 1-3 and I've loved every episode. I'm surprised they haven't cloned this series on HBO or Showtime. I think it's a little dry for American audiences. If you can come to grips with the dry but solid writing of this original show then you're well on your way to enjoying a well made program. Pick it up with a little patience and I think you'll love this one."
5,Great fun,"If you enjoyed the Ocean's 11, 12, 13 series of movies, check out this British tv series. Great writing, great actors, great fun."
5,Sharp and Fresh,"Hustle is a great con show with all the theatrics of a great heist movie like Ocean's Eleven. The characters are all great and since they have a strict code of ethics you don't have to feel bad about cheering for the ""bad guys."" The show is good quality in both appearance and writing. Its a nice fun show that you can just sit back and enjoy. The writing is good enough that the cons don't get boring. If you like the caper genre you'll really like this show. If you like glitzy shows like Las Vegas (which is not as good as this at all) you'll like this show too. If you just like to watch interesting people doing interesting things then this show is for you also."
4,see Season Two first,"This is a delightful, witty series. Influenced by the amazon.com critiques for Season Two, I watched that series first and am glad I did.Main complaint with Season One is that three of the six episodes ""pay homage"" to THE STING. While this is okay for two of the three, the finale episode deepens appreciation for the Newman-Redford-Brennan feature.Worth the DVD investment, but first allow yourself to get hooked by the less derivative second season."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Unfortunately I've already bought the book. But I totally agree with R.Reichard. Stay away from this book.I finally managed to install the database, but only after writing my own sql scripts. But the application script is full of mistakes too! I gave up after i received this error message:""Server Error in '/Community' Application....Requested Url: /Community/notRegsitered.aspx""Well, notRegsitered.aspx doesn't exist (nor does notRegistered.aspx).To install the database you're told that there is a SQL script in the Starting_Point folder. Wrong, there are three SQL scripts and nothing tells you in which order to execute them. Although it's fairly simple to determine that once you read the scripts, it really doesn't help. Because they don't work.Later you're told to copy the webctrl_client folder from the Startig_point folder on the CD. But there is no webctrl_client folder. It's called aspnet_client, of course.I could go on - but there's really no point. Just don't by the d... book."
1,Rubbish!,"I bought the book for two reasons1)It was supposed to be above beginner level2)It was supposed to be in C#3)It was supposed to be really hands-oni'm only in chapter 2 and the book has already failed in point 2.How the h**l did the publishers let such a kind of blunder get to print, i'm really disappointed. It just goes to show you cant judge a book by its cover, ....(rubbish)"
2,Mushy Stuffing,"I expected the olive to be stuffed with an anchovy fillet (or part of an anchovy), but it appears to be stuffed with anchovy paste so the mouth feel is ""mushy."" I was disappointed as I thought the idea was good."
1,It was very disappointing to me.,"I have Vicki's two low fat cookbooks and think they are outstanding. I bought this book and was very disappointed. Maybe I was just expecting too much because her other books had helped me so much. Sorry, but I would not recommend this book."
3,Birthright,"Birthright was one of the first books I read as an aside to my favorite hobby rpgs. It was successful in passing some time and providing a little inspiration about bloodlines, but other than that, it was only memorable because I read it three or four times."
1,Another poorly written male adolescent fantasy,"This book has nothing to commend it. First, the main character gets to have Penthouse forum style sex (and lots of it)with a nymphomaniac 19-year old princess and an amzonian female elf. The women in the novel exist only to ""produce male heirs"" for the main characters who seem quite content with the arangement. It gives them time to run about the countryside fighting battles which are so unrealistically portrayed and require such a leap of faith on our part to believe it is laughable. Furthermore, the prose of this novel is leaden and redundant. Every enemy charges with a ""ululating"" war cry, for example. Dialogue is stilted and the characters often repeat the same phrase two pages later. Finally, nothing happens. This novel has one of the singularly boring plots I have ever come across. In summary - skip this novel. It is not worth your time to read."
3,Good for beginers not for the experienced,"""The service is good but I didn't find anything that I didn't already know. This is a good start for someone that doesn't have any experience. The advice is good. """
4,Nice documentation of Brendel,"Brendel is not the easiest pianist to watch. The music is heavenly and the interpretations superb. This is a great documentation of one of the great pianists of the last couple generations. The sound quality is fine and the film work acceptable color. However, all the interpretive angst is displayed in his face. I think it is real angst but I prefer to let the music speak for itself. The introductions in German are interesting and gives you some insight into Schubert and Brendel. Subtitles in English are available. If you never saw him in concert this DVD may be worth acquiring. It also may be worth it for those who have very fond memories of the beauty and passion that Brendel brought to us. I think the London Brendel box 4782622 7 CDs of music for not much more money is a safer bet. They were recorded a decade later in excellent sound. I love Brendel but I prefer to just listen with my eyes closed."
4,"Well executed, flaws in final mix","The re-master of a 1974 Decca Record recording is excellent in execution and style. Neveille Marriner and St. Martin-in-the-Fields perform in their typical excellent manner.However, the recording over emphasize the soloist. I find this unfortunate, since the play between the opposing instruments is a little lost.Still, an excellent recording."
3,"A great document of the reunion tour,",this double album is worth six bucks of anyone's hard earned. It is particularly good to hear artists of the stature of Lou Reed and John Cale do full justice to compositions that they must have grown heartily sick of in the intervening twentyfive years. A true bargain.
1,"As a dedicated fan, eben this price isn't worth your time","I have avidly pursued numerous VU albums. In addition to owning all of their released material, I have acquired bootlegs and unreleased tracks. This album was a trumendous diappointment. The Velvet Underground lost their magic after breaking up following the release of Loaded. All members of the band have remained talented. But together again after so many years, this Velvet Underground's recording is a painful experience, a harsh reminder of a vibrance that once existed and is no longer there. My advice is to stick with the original recordings or old live ones."

5,What you can expect,"Has 2 flaps to protect water from coming in the outside plugs.I suspect the builders of this cord thought that you will not leave this outside unplugged, so the center plug does not have a cover lid.1 AC socket into 3 sockets; seems good enough for some garden spotlights!"
4,It works.,"Not sure how you rate such a simple product like this, but it got the job done without any issues."
4,USB A female - B male,"Inexpensive and quick delivery. Product didnt work for what i needed it for. Cant say for certain if its deffective, as the connection settup is complicated and on an internet search is quite possibly unable to be done. Oh well. 4 stars for price and availability. Couldnt find even 1 locally."
1,Leaks,I had the same leaking problem that another reviewer had. After about 1 month of daily use this unit starts leaking from the back and liquid coffee goes down to the warming plate making a mess and causing a burnt coffee smell. The company kindly sent me another unit but the same thing happened. So now they are sending me a second replacement and I chose a different model which hopefully will be more reliable. But based on the review on that unit I am not optimistic that unit is any better.
2,Beware the cup filter,"Perhaps I have been brainwashed into believing that the method of brewing coffee influences flavor, but I have been using a cone style filter for most of my adult life and was shocked when I opened this coffee maker and discovered it had a cup-style filter (not mentioned anywhere I could see in the advertisements for it). As with another reviewer, the temperature was much lower than my favorite old Cuisinart which broke down after many years of daily-plus use, and the coffee cooled down in my cup before I was even halfway finished with it. I packaged this DeLonghi back up and went and replaced my Cuisinart with the identical one I have used for years."
1,DeLonghi No More,"We used a Delonghi DCF212T for several years and it eventually stopped working. We liked the Front Access and aware that the recent reviews were less than good we purchased a replacement in April 2011. The Coffee Maker worked well, bearing in mind that the Carafe dripped badly and I needed to Microwave the finished coffw for 30 secs to make it hot, but it did what we had expected. Like the pervious one the heating pad began to flake due to leaks from the brewing basket when taking out the carafe but the recent model just stopped working a few days ago after only 11 months. Should have taken note of the reviews. Will not buy another."
3,Great Coffee Maker BUT It Leaks !,I concur with other reviewers; great easy to use design but it leaks; and it appears they all do at some point in their life cycle !
1,Can NOT be cleaned internally,"I forgot to put in the filter so grounds got inside. So far as I can see, there is no way to get in there and clean it out. The manual says to rinse it, but there are areas that you can see from outside that a rinse would not reach unless you immerse the entire unit, which is not what the manual means by rinse. It means run clear water through as if making coffee but without grounds. This will not clean the inside completely. I tried it, a sludge remains that you can see from outside UNDER the bowl where the filter should go. As it has electronic components, I doubt if immersion is the answer, and may be dangerous when you plug it in. There are some screws showing that might allow disassembly for the brave. Now shopping for another brand, something simple that will easily allow access to everything - for us who err."
5,Easy to Fill Coffee Maker,"I bought this coffee maker for our motor home because it was so inconvenient to fill the one I had from the top. We've used it for about 3 months as we travel, and really like the convenience of the front fill. We use prepackaged coffee filter packs and when making 12 cups, we like to use the Aroma button for a perfect brew. Others mentioned the coffee not being hot enough, but I haven't found that to be an issue."
2,"Nice design, needs adjustment","I love that the lever opens towards you so that it can be kept under cabinets. There are flaws - the coffee is not near as hot as I would like. I usually fill a cup and microwave to temperature. Also, the coffee brews weaker than I am used to using exact measurements I used with old coffee maker. I compensate by adding more coffee. Also wish it would stay on longer. And the brew time is ridiculous - I don't know why it is so slowwwww. i try to do other things while waiting for it to brew but still find myself tapping my foot and waiting for enough coffee for ONE cup!"
2,Lasted about 9 months,"I would have only given this machine 4 stars to begin with because at first it took about 7 minutes to brew 10 cups which was long compared to my old Cuisinart. After about 6 months it started taking about 10-12 minutes to brew. Then, it started brewing only 8 of the 10 cups of water we put in. Now it takes about 30-35 minutes to brew and delivers about half the water in the form of coffee. Tried various descaling methods over the past several months, cleaning it from top to bottom to no avail. Don't buy this machine."
2,Worked great for 5 months,"Worked well for 5 months, then one day it was just dead. Won't be spending any more of my hard earned cash on Delonghi products."
4,Great convenience for smaller kitchens,"I have owned this coffemaker for over a year, it still works fine for daily use. The best part is the front access, both water and coffee are loaded using a swing out arm on the front of the machine. If you have a smaller kitchen and counterspace, this is a great convenience.It is a bit slow, but as long as I set it up before retiring for the night this is no problem, the timer is very reliable.Compared to other reviews, mine has never leaked, the coffee could be hotter, but I don't like burning my tongue, so it is hot enough for my taste."
4,Worked great for two years and then...,"We had this coffee maker for almost 3 years and we loved it. It was great not having to pull the whole unit out to fill. All and all we loved this machine and used it daily for almost 3 years. Then the heating element broke and put out cold coffee. We are very bummed and in the market for a new coffee maker. We are not sure if we will buy another of these, but will consider it."
1,Very disappointing,"I wanted this coffeemaker because I thought the concept of loading the coffee and water from the front was great.While it worked well for a few months, within 7 months it got extremely slow in brewing. At its slowest it took 45 minutes to brew 4 cups of coffee. After cleaning it multiple times over a week, it only got a slightly faster.I cleaned it fairly regularly but despite that, it still slowed down to the point that I gave up and bought a $30 Black & Decker coffeemaker at Wal-Mart.Unless you want to clean this coffeemaker every week, I do not recommend this coffeemaker. Save the money and buy a Black & Decker or GE."
1,every one-star review is correct,"I agree with every 1-star review this thing has gotten. It should really get no stars at all. Every major complaint expressed: I have the same complaint. It's a bad design, the coffee is not hot enough, and at less than one year old, it leaks coffee everywhere."
3,So close,"I really want to love this product, but the flaws are just too glaring to ignore. This machine is so sleek and fits so wonderfully under my cabinet, I can't believe more manufacturers don't make something similar. You'd think DeLonghi could at least make an equally elegant system for programming the clock and autostart. The red/green indicator lights are also counter-intuitive. And while I don't need my coffee piping hot when it comes out, I do need to nuke the first cup or two to make it drinkable.DeLonghi is so close to hitting it out of the ballpark with this project, but in the end, it's a swing and a miss. I would love to buy another one if they fixed these shortcomings."
1,SLOW!!!!,"This coffee pot has a good design & I really want it to work, but it takes FOREVER. 45 - 1 hour to completely brew a pot of coffee. They seem to have forgotten the most important feature of a coffee pot. And the clock is a dumb design too.Buy something else."
3,Review for this pot,"This is a decent pot, though it takes too long to brew. Also the coffee isn't super hot upon completion. First pot arrived broken, and I was surprised how quickly they corrected the problem - so customer service gets an A+ THAT IS ALL. -Sam"
1,Died in a week.,I liked the design of the coffee maker with its ease of use. However it died after one week. If it had lasted at least a year I would have giving it four stars. I'm just glad I was able to return it for a full refund from Target.
1,worst desing!,"I just spent the last 3 hours trying to fix this poorly made coffee maker. The Delonghi dcf212t looks great from the outside, but inside its the worst design. First thinking it was the filter that was leaking I tried making small washers. It took me awhile to discover that the water from the machine just drips down onto the hotplate. Great just waiting for an electrical shock while brewing up a pot. Thanks for nothing Delonghi."
2,A bad buy,This is only good if you like your coffee lukewarm which I don't. And if you want to make 8 cups you must put in 11 tablespoons of coffee. You always have to add three tablespoons to the amount of cups you are making. At this rate I will be buying stock in Maxwell House. I would not by it again.
2,strange odor,"When the coffee brews, it gives off a strange odor - I think it's ""outgassing"" from the plastic. Have used it about 4 times and am hoping that the odor goes away (soon) with use. If not, I'll have to toss it and begin a new search for a ""swinging basket"" style. It's a shame that Braun discontinued its ""swinging basket"" coffee maker. Thom"
4,Almost perfect,"This is a beautifully designed coffeemaker. Very easy to fill, brew, pour. You don't have to pull the machine out from the wall to prepare the coffee. I like the fact that it has a permanent filter -- one less thing to mess with. I haven't had any problems with dripping or burning. It's a nice-looking machine, and I'm very pleased with the coffee it brews. Other reviewers have complained that it doesn't get hot enough -- that's actually one thing I like about it. I don't like for my coffee to be scalding hot. This machine brews it hot but not scalding, and the coffee is drinkable as soon as I pour it. The coffeemaker does not have a reheating feature, which would have been nice. If I brew 12 cups but don't drink it all, I can't reheat it the next day except in the microwave. Overall, a really nice coffeemaker. I'm very happy with it."
2,Delonghi coffeemaker leaks,"I have owned this coffeemaker for one year, and it's been leaking slowly for about 6 months. Unfortunately I waited too long to contact the company and now it's out of warranty and they will do nothing to help me despite the fact that there definitely seems to be a defect based on the vast number of reviews that say it leaks. Although it's a convenient design, DO NOT PURCHASE this as inevitably, it will probably leak and you'll have to buy a new one."
1,"DESIGN FLAW, just Like Everyone Else-IT LEAKS","My wife have had this product for a few months and generally only use it when our in-laws come over or host parties, or weekends. We got back from a weekend getaway, decided to make a pot of java, and sure enough, the coffee pot is leaking out that back as others on this review has prescribed to. What a ""POT"" of junk and it sounds like it's not worth sending it back since 1) it's on the ""customers"" dime to do so and 2) the replacement Delonghi sends is just as big of piece as the first ones. Sounds like it's time to do my part w.r.t reducing my carbon foot-print and go green by recycling this pathetic effort of a drip coffeemaker and share my thoughts with DeLonghi."
5,DeLonghi coffeemaker,"This coffeemaker makes coffee that is warm and stays warm. It is very easy to use with the front load basket. We do like the option of the ""aroma"" button to enhance the coffee as well. Also, the coffee does not drip when pouring it into coffee cups. This is an issue with some other coffeemakers. This is our 2nd De Longhi coffeemaker, and we are very happy with it.."
2,Delonghi front loading coffeemaker,"Like others , we have begun to experience the leaking and burnt coffee smell. I believe we have traced it to the lever arm in the back that makes the sneak a cup feature work. It appears that over time this part becomes misshapen , and no longer works properly. I did have success in stopping the leaks by removing the spring from under the filter holder. No more leaks , but , of course, now the sneak a cup feature does not work. But , to me that is really no big deal .But, for those looking for a ""first aid"" fix to the leak problem, removing the spring does seem to work . Thanks to the other reviewer for suggesting it."
2,TOO SLOW,"I used this coffee maker for a week at a rental home. Front access was convenient. BUT it was the slowest coffee maker I ever used. I was tempted to pull out and use the back up coffee maker. Also not sure about the ""aroma"" button. Who doesn't want to smell the coffee brewing?"
4,Works just fine,"I had another DeLonghi product (a toaster oven) that worked well, so I thought that I would try this coffee maker. Others have said that their coffee is not hot enough. After making coffee this morning, I stuck two cooking thermometers in my cup. One read 148 degrees F, the other read 150 degrees F. McDonald's was sued for 180 degree coffee - how hot do you want it to be? (...)We have used this for several months now, and it is convenient with front access to everything. As others have mentioned, one negative is having to hold the clock button to slowly cycle through the time setting. This is something that we rarely do, so not a big negative for us. If you have a need to change the setting often, it is something to consider. This is why I rated it four stars vs. five.With its built-in filter, there is no need to buy coffee filters, which provides lower cost of ownership also."
1,Just died after 4 months,I bought and happily enjoyed this coffee maker for 4 months and then had it all setup for a pot of coffee one morning and pushed the on button and nothing happened. After checking water and electric by unplugging - the pot knocked my kitchen power out when I plugged it in again. I loved this maker design but 4 months does not make a good lifetime for use. I feel ripped off.
2,2 Stars for the front access,"We bought this coffee maker at Target (cheaper on Amazon) and have had it less than 90 days. It has never seemed to make very hot coffee and now the burner has quit working all together. I really liked the front access feature, but other than that it was a waste of money."
1,Failed in 29 Days,"Works nice and looks good but heating failed after 29 days.It replaced a $10 coffemaker I had used for 6 years with this chrome piece of C__p. Manufacturer has poor record for repairs.I was taken. I did not read other customer reviews before purchase.Avoid grief, avoid this product."
1,Weak coffee,"I loved this machine when I brought it home. It is well-designed, convenient in its compartments and beautiful in a way no other coffee machine is. It was a joy to use. Unfortunately, my DeLonghi only ever produced a weak pot of coffee. I tried everything: different coffee varieties, different grinds, different amounts of grounds, permanent filter, paper filters, aroma button, no aroma button, but nothing ever produced a satisfying cup. I found myself looking forward to using my fiance's fifteen-year-old Sunbeam coffee maker which, much to my surprise, made better coffee than my charming and sleek DeLonghi. I finally got fed up with the situation and returned it. I miss its design, but not its coffee."
1,They made it better!,"We had the old DeLonghi for almost a decade, and have been very pleased with it. My husband uses it a LOT. This new design is a definite upgrade, because we can access everything we need from the front. This makes it easier to clean, and easier to operate in our crowded kitchen.After my husband's coffee fondness would cause the cheap ones to break in 9 months or so, we splurged on a DeLonghi, and saved money!UPDATE - This one has already broken. Some kind of membrane appeared in the tank when we tried to see why it was dumping water instead of brewing coffee. This made us quite unhappy, since a) our previous DeLonghi lasted for years and b) shipping alone would preclude us sending it anywhere to be fixed.And we're not buying another one! Husband declared he's had it with poor quality products, and we're getting a French Press."
1,don't waste your money!!!,"first.coffee was not hot enough to disolve my creamer, had to zip it up in microwave, i don't like my coffee scalding hot but this was luke warm at best! second. features a ''cup warmer'' on top, this does not work. third.no light on clock, has to be in a well lit area to see time,black on grey readout very hard to see! fourth. carafe leaked coffee everytime we poured it!fifth. about a two inch wide channel to pour the water in , if you don't have the hands of a surgeon your going to spill it!!! sixth. supposed to stop coffee in mid perk so you can get a cup before carafe is filled,leaked onto burner plate about half the time. lastly i'm not an engineer but i know a poor design when i have seen and used it!!! being from wilmington ohio and still living here (barely)you learn to value every penny!!!i hope this review was helpful,this was bought through home hardware store not amazon. bought G.E. coffee maker third off price and its great thank you for reading this j . z"
3,"Great coffee maker, but needs minor improvement","We love the swing-out water/coffee bin access, and the brewing process is perfect (4 or 5 stars worth). However, I'm getting tired of cleaning rust stains from both the heating element and the outside bottom of the glass carafe. The uncoated metal element gets wet, of course, and rust is the result. Most other maker's heating elements are coated with teflon or are of a metal that doesn't rust. The other complaint is the timer/clock. The clock advances forward only, so it takes ""forever"" to set the timer to an earlier setting than was previously chosen. You have to scroll all the way, through the entire 23 1/2 hours, just to have the coffee machine turn on 1/2 hour earlier. I bet it would cost almost nothing to improve this feature. Nice ""tuck under the cabinet"" machine, makes great coffee, and the price is fair. Fix these 2 small items, and it's a real winner!Larry"
1,Leaks from the bottom after 3 months of owning it,"After three months of owning this coffee pot, it began leaking from the bottom of the maker. It leaks so bad that when we get up in the morning the coffee is on the floor instead of in the pot. Worst $70 I have ever spent."
2,Too many problems to live with,"Well, we finally had to get rid of this coffee maker and get a new one. We just couldn't wait 45 minutes for a pot of coffee. I can't say that this is just recently; it seem to be since we bought it. It usually isn't a problem since we use the timer but if we forget to set it the night before, we end up going to work without coffee since we don't have that long to wait. The coffee that it makes never is quite hot enough which also contributes to the poor quality of the coffee you get. Add those two issues to the fact that the pot drips everywhere when you pour anything out of it and we ended up buying a new one and will sell this one at a yard sale. Too bad because it has some nice features that others don't have but in the end, if you don't get a cup of good, hot coffee then what's the use."
2,Not Worth The Convenience,"While the under-the-counter design is very appealing, this one is not worth all of the other issues. I had all of the problems other people had--constant leaking, overflows from the back, etc. After six months, it finally just stopped brewing altogether. I am sure I could get a replacement from DeLonghi, but do I really want to start this all over again?"
2,Luke Warm Coffee,"I loved the design of the coffee maker. Not having to move the coffee maker to pour water is a great idea. However, it does not heat the coffee well. The coffee is luke warm. Great look, poor outcome.Another negative is the length of time it takes to brew 4 cups of coffee. Almost 20 minutes!Don't waste your money on this machine. Buy another and you will be happier."
3,Decided to take a leak,"Got this around early 2010, worked great for two years but a couple weeks ago started to leak at the bottom all over the counter. Loved the design of the drawer like pull out for your grounds and water, makes total sense and wish more makers had this feature. Unfortunately with the leaks and because other people are still reporting this problem I decided to ditch it and went with a Cuisinart."
1,Leaky machine,"We bought this machine because of the front-loading feature, which is convenient. However, it leaks coffee all over the burner when its brewing causing a mess and a smell of burnt coffee (not my favorite). I would not recommend this machine for this reason."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"Front access is a plus.Coffee burning on the heating plate and stinking up the house is bad.Good design, bad end product."
4,Good Coffee Maker,Works great.....only thing that would make it better is if I had noticed it at Sam's Club first....It was about 25% cheaper.
3,S..L..O..W..E..S..T coffee maker ever,"As mentioned by others, it takes a LONG time to make a full pot - almost a half hour. And that's on the regular setting, not the ""Aroma"" setting that's supposed to take longer and enhance the flavor. And when it's finally done, the coffee is not that hot.The front access is a nice touch, but I would not buy this machine again."
3,"Carafe is brittle, coffee only warm","The undercounter design is great although the steam vent is out the back so you'll still get moisture on your cupboards. The coffee is only warm, not hot at all and the carafe cracked even with extreme care being taken while washing. It felt thin and brittle from the start.I'd buy this if you are really limited on space but buy an extra carafe and have the microwave handy."
1,Design Flaw - Poor customer service,"My daughter had bought this coffee pot but it soon was replaced by a Cuisinart because of it leaking brewed coffee on to the counter. It was leaking down the pause and pour feature. It got sent to the basement as a back up coffee pot because of this.Then it came to my house, when mine died just before a major family gathering. I decided to write the company but didn't have the details when it was bought. They won't stand behind their product because of this even though by now I am sure they have heard from countless other consumers about this same problem!To sum it up, they have a problem with their research and development team and their customer service is severely lacking. In today's poor economy, where companies have to compete for the limited consumer dollars, it would be fitting for DeLonghi to wake up and smell the coffee!"
2,slow,"this coffee maker is very slow. Carafe only keeps coffe warm for a very short time, and leaks when you pour. Don't like it at all!"
1,Leaks like a sieve,"As many other people have stated, this coffee maker has a major problem with leaks. After a few months, the mechanism that should allow you to pause brewing to pour a cup started wicking the coffee to the back of the machine. It would then run down the back of the machine onto and into the hot plate. Not only is this inconvenient and messy, but appears to be a fire hazard, too. I notified DeLonghi of this problem and they were not helpful. After reading the reviews that other people have posted, this is a problem that is not unique to my machine. I would definitely avoid this coffee maker."
1,Please take note...,Just so everyone is aware- in fine print it does say that this item is from Ikea. They cost 3.99 there- not particularly impressed with the product- plus you are essentially paying $11.00 for shipping even with Amazon Prime. Had it been more obvious that this was an Ikea item- I would not have ordered. I live near an Ikea- could have gotten nearly 400 candles for this price... Waste of my time and money.
4,Great price for tea candles,"Okay, these are just tea candles. Nothing exceptional about the product. You can't really go wrong with tea candles!But, that said, as someone who much prefers to shop online, I found the price here to be great."
2,Wanting to learn more,"I bought this book with the beleif that I could learn how to open myself to a healing art. I am mostly interested in learning how to heal my stress realted symptoms. After reading all the reviews for this book, I was really excited and went out and bought it, here is what I found: The book is an advert for Reiki, and can only be used if you have gone to Reiki workshops (I have not). It does not explain how to open yourself to healing power, does not give any mantras or symbols but tells you that they are 'confidential', and can only be obtained through a master. Page 60 is when it actaully gives some useful information mostly in the form of pictures of how you should place your hands while healing, this is useless unless you have been on a course. In short its a Great Advert for Reiki, full of pretty pictures and useless unless you have attended Reiki classes."
5,An excellent general reiki book.,This is an excellent book explaining the basics of Reiki. It is well illustrated with photographs rather than drawings and is very easy reading.
5,Beautifully Illustrated,"This book, in addition to providing a basic grounding in Reiki principles, is also beautifully illustrated with photographs, that are enjoyable to look at without even reading the well-written text. I haven't completely read the book yet, so I think it would be unfair to comment on text."
4,Reiki,I used this book to teach my Reiki I class. It is a wonderful book to teach from and the colors and pictures make the book enjoyable reading.
3,Good maybe for clients but not for practicioners,I was pretty dissappointed with this book. I does have beautiful layout and pictures but there is no real insight in the book. I would recomend this book for people who are thinking about getting attuned or are curious about what a reiki treatment is
3,witchcraft,"Its funny that everyone makes a sign of the cross when you say you are studying Wicca but its okay to study Reiki. Not to much of a difference. But I did not like this book because it does not share a lot of the information because it ""is secret"" and you must be initiated first. Sound like witchcraft and they book of shadows. I am not against witchcraft as I do study Wicca but don't write a book that says you will learn Reiki if you are not going to be taught Reiki. I think someone was writing a book to sell at there classes, or selling books to get people to join a class."
5,book review,"The Power of Reiki: An Ancient Hands-On Healing Technique is a great book, lots of photo's and drawings of how and where to place your hand and how to get stated in Reiki. Since reading this book, I've contacted a person that teaches Reiki and can not wait to start my class.Healing yourself by the tech. in this book seem so easy, and everyone should be able to help themselves and their friends.My Daughter has the Power in her hands naturally and I'm getting her to go with me to the class, she can already use her hands and you can feel them getting HOT just after a few seconds. and after a 10 to 15 minutes, the pain in my back will decrease by as much as 50%. WOWGreat book, everyone should read it."
5,The Power of Reiki,Excellent. Impressed with speed of delivery and condition of the book. This is a wonderful resource for my library of Reiki books.
5,"For artists, poets, performers","This is a wonderful guide to an ancient philosophy which holds that the creation of art by humans is part of the greater process of the creation of the universe by the gods and goddesses. It's written in an accessible style and includes lovely translations of hymns and verses from the Vedas. I found it affirming, inspiring, deeply thought-provoking. I underlined phrases on almost every page!"
1,Disappointing,My first and last T. Jefferson Parker book. What a waste. Yet another unbeliever mocks the Christian faith and turns a character who is a sympathetic character as a loving pastor into a secretly practicing homosexual. How Hollywood.You like mysteries? Try Robert Crais or Michael Connelly. You won't be disappointed like you will be with T. Jeff. No more wasting my Kindle download money on this author.
2,What a struggle!,"I nearly gave up after 200 pages. Slow, tedious, no point to the book. Then 75 or so pages of good action, followed by an ending you had already figured out about page 175. Skip it, not worth the time or energy."
2,A Dud,"Until this book I had been a devoted Parker fan, but this one was a dud for me. The story starts slowly and builds, if that's the right word for it, to a barely lukewarm finish. I put this book down at least half a dozen times in the first hundred-plus pages, intending to not finish it. I kept picking it up again, thinking I had perhaps missed something, hoping the story would become more engrossing. I hadn't, and it didn't. I gave it 2 stars more out of sympathy than because of the quality of the tale. Every author writes a dud now and then. I hope this was Parker's only one."
3,More history than mystery,"I'm a fan of Parker, and although this book wasn't exactly what I thought it would be, it was still a pretty good story. More of a family history than a mystery. I think you'll realize this early in the book, but it didn't really bother me. A good read..."
5,Neat Story by a Consumate Master,"Just when it was looking like all mysteries had to revolve around a series character, here comes the Parket novels. You open one of these with no idea of what's going to happen.Reading the flyleaf, and you are expecting a Hatfields and McCoys set in 1960's California. Problems between the Becker boys and the Vonn kids seem to be the key point of the story as the story of the murder of Janelle Vonn moves to the front.Then the first chapter, in less than three full pages has one of the Becker boys turns everything upside down as one brother tells another: ""Everything we thought about Janelle Vonn was wrong.""After that ... well, I'm not going to tell you. Let me just say that the development of the characters and the setting in a time of a small war are the marks of a consumate master of his task."
4,Review of California Girl by T. Jefferson Parker,"I found this novel very intriguing. The story is quite dark, and develops during the 60's, with many noteworthy characters such as Richard Nixon and Charles Manson. It has a similarity to Laguna Heat in many respects. I hope the author writes more novels of southern California during this period of time."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I just began reading this author. I really liked The Fallen and Silent Joe. Both of those protagonists could carry a whole series of sequels. Each had a flawed and unusual character. CA Girl had none of that. Half-way through I just skipped to the end to see who ""done"" it. The writing was choppy. I could never tell which brother was narrating. The characters were NOT interesting. None of them seemed authenic or genuine. By the middle, I just didn't care about the ending or these people."
2,Neither a mystery nor a drama,"If you are looking for a good thriller or a good mystery book this is not really the case. The plot is very keen on following police procedures, in another way to reinforce the story's realism, besides the appearance of real people like Nixon. So no chills nor surprises here.As per the drama side, the effort to grab the brothers' story and make it somehow meaningful and larger than the story itself is visible but not successful. Most of time the stories of the brothers - and some other characters - really don't add nothing to the mood of the book and even less in literary terms and breaks the chance of adding some thrills to the plot.So if you are looking for a book that is more than a thriller this not the case either.Basically things didn't turn out well and the book is kind in no mans land, being neither a mystery nor a drama."
3,Not an easy read,"If you like a fast, easy read with a sense of humor (e.g. Lashner, Levine, Rosenfelt), you're in the wrong part of town. I have no knowledge of the ""California"" life in the '60s; but Patterson's depiction of it didn't interest me and I felt it slowed down the narrative to the point of ennui. At 81 years of age, I like narratives to move a little faster. His characters are developed in spurts.A worthwhile read if you're looking to pass the time leisurely."
2,I put the novel down at page 45,"Sorry. I had super high expectations, but I didn't like thechoppy writing style, and there were too many characters toto keep track of. I think the author needed a single characterright off the bat that I really cared about. It didn't happen.Then I went to the negative reviews and was convinced tosave my time. I bought the book for $10 at an airport (ouch!)."
4,"not bad. haunting, heavy and nostalgic","the thing i love most of parker's novels is his sporadic philosophic thoughts on life and death, time and changes, the contrast of the past and the present, especially orange county, southern california. this novel is about a murder case also inevitably involved the past and the present, the families, the people who were born, grew up, grew old and dying. the change of the landscape in orange county was so great and so pathetic yet we call it progress. all the oranges that made orange county as 'the orange county' were long gone and we could just find it in parker's novels.this one, like some others, was not an easy read. you have to chew it slowly, otherwise the picture of the past won't become quite vivid but vague, dark and haunting. lot of quite philosophic ways looking at life and death were buried quite deep yet you could dig them out one by one if you didn't read it too fast. like always, a painful but a joyful reading at the same time."
4,Good Book,"I read this book because I like to read nominated or winning books for the Edgar Awards. This was the third of three book that I have read from T. Jefferson Parker (others being WHERE SERPENTS LIE and SILENT JOE). I like to read an author in order of publication but I have strayed off course for Jeff Parker.I liked the book because it was one of those books that I could read a couple chapters here and there, not rush it, but enjoy taking my time with it. Trust me, I love those books you can't put down but sometimes it is nice to read one of these 'pace' books.The intertwined stories involved in the book kept my interest and waiting to see how they finalized was good. No huge surprises but my brow was raised a few times.All in all, I am beginning to like TJ Parker. He is still not in my elite group of hardcover authors but I will continue to read his books and enhance my opinion of his writing."
4,Entertaining reading,"It is quite good mystery novel, it definitely keeps you going, I would recommend it wholeheartedly to anybody who is looking for entertaining read. It might be a little bit slow in the beginning, but then it picks up and keeps going."
4,A GOOD READ,I liked this book. It's about a teen beauty queen found murdered in an old building. It dragged a bit in parts but I liked the story though. It's also about two families growing up in California starting in the 50s.
3,Reinventing a genre work,"The mystery here will not strain your brain, fellow readers, because the archetype is well-known (no spoilers in this review). However, Parker has added quite a bit to the method of getting there that most authors favor. First, he splits his narrative between characters, and by relating them all not only to a past event but to family lines, he is able to give their actions a greater context that is instructive. It seems to me that many detective novels are literature gone underground, and this is no exception. Inside details of this story are insightful and amusing conclusions about life, society, drugs, sex and death. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes the cerebral side of detective fiction and police procedural mysteries."
4,Great stuff!,"Mr. Parker has always been exceptional at characterization, but this book nails real atmosphere as well, and is at the top of my 2004 list, along with The Narrows by Michael Connelly, Memorial Day by Harry Shannon and that new Robert Crais. The 60's seem especially relevent these days (war and all) so the writing really make my skin ripple. Great stuff! Buy it, you won't be disappointed. As usual."
3,Great insight into the actors craft; but Pacino is a bit self-indulgent,"The DVD's are excellent examples of the art of acting, as Pacino shows the hard work and preparation that goes into getting a ""feel"" for a character and their relationship with other characters. Clearly these films were a passion project for him. This may explain why he seems so self-agrandazing; frankly it wore thin with me. Nonetheless, these DVD's illustrate just what a talented actor Pacino is. I wouldn't recommend it for entertainment viewing, but there is remarkable value for actors or those who love the craft."
4,Great Sound,"These speakers have a really great sound for outdoor speakers. They are very well made and attractive to look at. They do not come with mounting brackets, however, which made it a little difficult to hang them. We just had an outdoor party this weekend and got many compliments on them."
2,"Large size, small sound","Given these speakers large size and comparatively large price tag for weatherproof speakers, I expected a lot more out of them.They have a very noticeable overemphasis in the 1Khz to 4Khz range. To hear this, imagine you're listening to a full orchestra, but hearing the sound of a sharp trumpet predominate. It's not as bad outdoors where there's no chance for harmonic resonance, but mostly unbearable in an inclosed space.With the strength of the upper midrange, I found the speakers to be immanently locatable and provide a minimum of presence. I much prefer my sound to be as if the band or orchestra was floating around me, or at least nearby but invisible. These speakers stuffed the sound into their boxes."
5,"Sparkling, and no reservations!","If lovely melodies, crystal-clear sound, wonderful pacing do not interest you...then, do not buy these CDs, otherwise, go for it. Charles Dutoit does it again, he brings freshness, intelligence, drive, and, above all, incredible sound to this music. This is my first listening experience with Pascal Roge, he plays with deftness, charm, and, I think, with an appropreiate amount of romanticism. I had not heard four of the Concertos, and it is exciting to discover something new and unexpected.One of my favorite recordings!"
5,"Gorgeous, dramatic, good price","Saint-Saens is one of those composers who always makes classical music the way it should be. Maybe a little less experimentation than his contemporaries, but the results are rarely boring.This collection of concertos is an example of Saint-Saens at his best. Though only the second concerto has achieved fame as one of the great piano concertos, they are all wonderful: full of drama and beauty. Probably, people had to choose one favorite, so they chose the second and neglected the rest. But this recording presents all five concertos in all their splendour. A wonderful experience.It is a slight nusiance that the third concerto is split over the two CD's, but it is probably the only way they could have presented the five concertos in order.The performances are brilliant, and the recording sounds great."
5,Sublime,"I bought this collection randomly, having never heard any of Saint-Saens's music. Now four years later, I have heard some of these concerti performed live several times, and I've listened to recordings of these pieces from both big names (Rubinstein, Richter, et. al) and less popular pianists (Emil Gilels, Stephen Hough, Idil Biret..), and I have to say, those guys have nothing on Roge/Dutoit. These recordings have a certain undefinable energy to them that everyone else seems to lack; it's like they're at home, completely comfortable in this music, playing the way Saint-Saens would have wanted them to. I often listen to music in the background while working, and nothing can compare to this recording's ability to pull itself into the foreground. This is some of the most beautiful classical music, played perfectly."
2,Doesn't meet expectations,"First of all, the sound quality is poor. Second, the piano is played with excessive rubato. It seems that the show-boating is present and the tempo is slower than it ought to be because the pianist (who I know from other recordings) doesn't have quite the technique to play the faster parts of these works at the desired speed."
1,Not the greatest,"I'm guesing the other two reviewers are die hard judge dredd fans which is fine of course, to each his own - for someone like me who is brand new to dredd however I wouldn't recommend this book.... while it seems like there's a lot of potential for good stories here, each story in this book is way, way too short - the action's practically over before it starts, very little in the way of in depth character development... I guess I compare any graphic novel I read to the all time greats in that genre (Watchmen, The Dark Knight Returns, The Killing Joke, Sandman, Preacher, Kingdom Come, et cetera ) - in comparison this particular book falls waaaayyyyy short."
4,Wouldn't go without it,"Since I was a wee girl I've suffered from leathery hobbit feet; Prior to Alpha Hydroxy the only successful sole regime had been time consuming saunas several times/week, and even with regular pedicures and callus removals, I rarely wanted to show them off from below after 48 hours.Enter this wonderful product. At last the skin on my feet is quite smooth and soft with minimal maintenance. I noticed a difference within days. Calluses still require attention but are localized and far less obtrusive. Overall this is a great find, and mercifully fragrance free.The small 2oz size which barely lasts a month when used as directed accounts for the star off. It's not exactly cheap and in my case the cream really does need to be applied 3 times daily. A side benefit is that my fingers feel silkier to the touch & cuticles look cleaner, just from application of the cream."
3,it helps..,i use it then put grape seed oil on my elbows and heels...nice and simple to apply and no smell
3,Just Okay,"I bought this for dry feet and I haven't seen much difference compared to other foot lotions or products. With such a high alpha hydroxy acid content, I thought I'd see better results but was disappointed."
5,Exciting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11,This book had different stories and people. It was very exciting. I suggest it to anyone who loves a suprising story.
4,Greek tale of love and adventure!,"This book is simply amazing! I myself find it a lot better than the Prydain Chronicles (more charcter development, etc). A great story with lots of character development and fantasy. The only part of this book I would change is the constant reference to Greek myth. I saw references to the Trojan horse, Daedalus and Icarus, The Labyrinth, Pandora's Box (did anyone else notice the references to Prydain's Dallben and Witches of Morva in the tale?), along with many others. The soothsayers were perfectly oily, and Lucian was simply a true hero (not like Odysseus, constantly bragging) along with many other magical characters who make for one great read!"
2,Not as good as the BlackCauldron Series,"I and my 11 year-old-son read this book and we both felt that author Alexander's Black Cauldron series was much better. The charater development was much more complete and the story line was much more interesting and less rushed. It seems as if, in his desire to add classsical myths to the story, he needed his characters to rush from one event to the other but never really developed them or their relationships. This would be a good story for younger children with good reading abilities."
5,an excellent adventure with a happy ending,This book is one of the best books I have ever read. It was the first Lloyd Alexander book I ever read but since then I have read as many books by him as I can get my hands on. He is an excellent author and this book is one of many that proves it.
2,A very biased look at the past,"Ms. Patterson's very strong bias toward native peoples comes through loud and clear in this work. The Hawaiian homeland movement certainly has much to recommend itself, but those who would advocate for a return to the days of the monarchy certainly, and conveniently, leave aside the many bad aspects of those days. However, this work is unique in allowing the gods and godesses of old Hawai'i to act as characters. Whether or not they are portrayed accurately is another question."
4,Not bad at all.,"I'm not a fan of first person shooters or Kiss; if you feel the same, read on. I recieved this game as a gift, when I got around to trying it out I was pleased to find the levels to be a perfect balance between challenge and fun. Not too dark (although I believe this is some variant of the Quake II or III engine). The game is fun to play, and I love the default control setup (use the analog pad to look around, the colored buttons to move around, and the triggers to use weapons).Quake III and Unreal are both more impressive for graphics, but they are designed to be multiplayer games. This game game has story element and most important it's fun and addictive.And as others have stated here (as well as myself) you do not have to be a fan of Kiss to enjoy this game, it's based off a comic book that's loosely based around the band. Kiss music is used in this game about as much as Nine Inch Nails music was used in the original Quake, it's transparent and blends with game play.Four stars."
3,Dissapointment,"What can I say what a letdown. While I am not a huge kiss fan, I do like the show they put on. The graphics are ok,game is fairly, straightfoward kill! Unless you are like a big Kiss fan stay away and wait for Half Life"
2,It's not that this game is bad.It just isn't that good.,"I decided to rent this game upon discovering kiss would hardly be in it.Well i must say, with other dc shooters out there, Kiss Psycho Circus really doesn't give you a single reason to buy it above the rest.It has the basic search for key, shoot a stupid looking enemy, where's a bigger gun element you'd expect, and cant pull it off that well.I don't know why but i really wasn't feeling the level design of this game.Why cant i run around in an abondoned carnival blasting carnies?That would've been cool.In it's defense, it does have some pretty impressive visuals and some cool looking baddies for you to hack up, but since the gameplay sort of fails, so does this game.There's no internet multiplayer, that didnt bother me at all really.BUT what did was the fact that there is NO multiplayer of any kind.That's right, no deathmatch.As it stands, this game warrants a rent if it looks attractive to you but there's better out there."
2,Lame...,"Yeah, I like KISS but this first person shooter is horrible. The enemies are super easy to kill, its not realistic and there is no real challenge to the game. The only reason this one gets 2 stars is the good graphics and you get to listen to KISS tracks while you play. My advice is to wait till Half-Life and Soldier of Fortune come to the Sega DC, they are much better and a lot more challenging. You'll just be disatisfied with Kiss Psycho Circus."
1,THIS WAS GARBAGE,"This game was COMPLETE GARBAGE. I did not even try to return it. Let it sit in a landfill so it can relieve somebody from the tedium of trying to play it.And why does KISS deny its poser-metal phase of the 1980s? I wanted to play as Paul Stanley wearing yellow spandex and fingerless elbow length pink gloves like he had on in the ""Tears Are Falling"" video. Didn't the developers think that some of us like the KISS disco song? Why isn't it there? ""Lick it Up"" is missing too. And why are we stuck with Gene/Paul/Ace/Peter when Vinny Vincent could have been included? They could have at least included a screen shot of the cover of ""Animalize"".It is time for KISS to break up. They are an utter joke. They should retire and live on their glory days of the 70s and 80s."
4,Great Book!,I read this book some time ago and just took it down from the shelf to look at something on the cover that caught my attention. Now I find myself reading it again!There are two story lines and they are interwoven beautifully. As you move between the stories you are left dying to know what is happening in the other thread. It turns you into a compulsive page turner (even the second time around). I recommend this book highly!
2,Cheap for a reason,"You get what you pay for, and my advice is don't cheap out on your modem. I had problems connecting to the internet, later found out this product should have included a cd with the necessary software to make it work, likely attribute this to the seller (njdevils45) rather than the product itself. As for the actual product, the cables are extremely short and not very useful. Overall cheap quality in design and manufacture."
3,Addicting Frustration,"I bought this game a few years ago and instantly loved it. I can play this game for hours on end while neglecting homework, :). The only two complaints I have for the game is that the graphics can be choppy and slow if you are running with minimal system requirments and some of the leaders faces show up as just a pair of eyes and teeth instead of a full face. If you have more than the minimal system requirments you will be fine. The only other complaint I have is that it allows you to build the Great Pyramids in England or Notre Dame in New York. I think it would be funner if the game were more accurate."
3,High expectations led to disappointment,"I have owned and played every version of Civ since the first one, which ran very well on a 640k system with 40 meg hard drive. Each new version has been better than the previous one, but the changes are minor improvements in my opinion, and are disappointing considering the huge increase in system requirements. I have also had a serious case of being ignored by the publisher's customer No Support department concerning the patch. I don't have internet access, and I asked them to send a cd with the patch on it--- nada. They were happy enough to take my money for the game, but when I wanted something to resolve some of the defects in the originaly issue---- forget it!!"
2,Civilization IV - don't buy it,"Civ III was superior in every respect to Civ IV. Gameplay in IV is mind-numbingly slow, and the emphasis on 3D rendering just detracts from the game (it's Civ, not Age of Empires!). I will be returning it for as much of a refund as I can manage.This game installed and worked perfectly on my computer, but I was still hugely disappointed. The high standards that have guided the Civ franchise until now have been abandoned."
3,"Fun, but not as great as its predecessors","We had no problems getting it to run on our computer,(albeit with some choppy framerates) but it just didn't seem like Civ to us. The swooping camera was a major distraction, and it was hard to keep more than a small part of your kingdom in view. Playing zoomed out made it hard to see what was going on. Creating units at the beginning of the game seemed to take longer than in Civ III, making the early stages a little boring. This game does have some fun things in it, but it just didn't impress us like Civ III did."
3,3d graphics adds nothing to this epic game series.,"The differences between CIV 3 and CIV 4 are small except for the 3d graphics. My PC has 2gHz processor, 512 DDR memory, and a 128 meg NVIDA graphics card. CIV 4 runs terribly slow and often freezes my PC. One of the attractions of CIV 3 was the ability to customize the game by producing your own units, building, technologies, ect.. That is impossible for all but the most advanced users in 3d. So don't expect many mods.The other new game features are great. The expanded importance of culture and religion are welcomed additions to the CIV franchise. One disappointing factor is that the battles are just as lame as before, one unit battles one unit at a time making for unnecessarily long game play and unrealistic results."
2,Great Game.... If It Works...,"I got this game as a Christmas present, and was quite excited to beginning playing it. Based on reviews by game sites (i.e. gamespot.com, gamespy.com etc.) this game sounds trully fantastic; and I'm sure it is. However, when I popped the game into my computer, it loaded succesfully, and I was able to launch it without problems. But before I could even begin to play, the graphics became extremely choppy, and it eventually froze. My computer exceeds all the minimum system requirements, as well as the majority of the recomended requirements. If you can get this game to run (that's a big ""if), I am sure that it will be quite fun...."
2,"Like the game, hate the support","I had played and owned all the Civilization games. This one is the worst. Graphics is awesome, but for this type of game, after a couple of hours, you would be more interested in the game, not the graphics. They need to come out with a patch that can turn off the graphics so game play would improve. I AM NOT GOING TO UPGRADE MY COMPUTER for this game. They can also do alittle better by providing tech support that actually want to help.Been waiting for new patches.. no luck yet. computer crashes a lot when playing in biggest world at diety level. if lowering the level, AI is too weak. graphics was ooo.. wow.. at first, got old fast.. perfer speed and stability over graphics."
1,"Nice Job, Sid","I thought I was doing something wrong. My system met all the requirements. Yet I could not get it to launch. My self-doubt turned to rage when, through trial and error, I realized the ""install"" and ""play"" CDs were misprinted/ reversed. My rage turned to molten lava when I could hear the sounds of the game, but could not see any graphics. My molten lava went through the roof when I read up on the game online and found that four out of five players are having the same problems. Do not, do not..... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."
5,Seemed boring to me but apparently its epic.,"I bought this game off of Steampowered and was expecting it to be epic, which I can see it is with all the different elements in the game. The only problem is that it's almost too complicated, once you get to the 1900's the turns take way too long and everything just slows down giving you nothing to do but move military forces around.To be fair I was expecting something like Black & White and thats not what this is at all, its about thinking and strategy, basically an electronic board game."
4,Way kool cross platform game...,"The game is a fun and thoughtful simulation of how civilizations advance from misty beginnings to a not so distant future. The 3D graphics are fun and informative. It's good instruction for anybody who thinks that national security is obtained just by buying troops. Unlike some computer simulations, people have the time they want to think out actions that would take years to implement in the real world. The Windows version on my wife's machine interacts fine with the Mac version on my machine. I'm buying another Windows version of the software to play with one of my grandsons in another state."
5,A Worthy Successor,"I have an ATI card and had some problems running the game. But the folks at CivFanatics.com have a screen-by-screen ""how to update your drivers and get the game to run"" section that is easy to follow. After updating all the things I should've updated anyway, the game runs fine.The game itself is great fun. It can be played on a variety of difficulty levels, so everyone can win. It got rid a lot of the tedium that plagued the end-game of Civ III (and Civ II and Civ). There are nice graphics, and the music is WONDERFUL.If you have any problems, contact the people at CiVFanatics.com. They will be glad to help. In addition, the site continually posts tips and hints for improving your play."
5,Civ Won Best Game of The Year,"This game lived up to the Best Game of 2005 Award that multiple gaming sites gave this game. This game allows you the freedom to create a culture, unique identity, and become the country that you've dreamed about. Do you want to reincarnate the Romans, The Huns, The Napoleanic Area, the US, anything is possible with this game. This game is best game I've played in my 29 years of gaming. If you don't like to think and just want to run around mindlessly with a gun, this game isn't for you. If you have some substance and imagination, you will love this game."
3,Civilization IV,"I bought this game for my 18 year old son, and he was bored most of the time because he did not feel as challenged by this game as others he has played. Might be okay for 13 to 15 year olds. He said it wasn't terrible but it could be so much better and more challeging. One of the best things, he said was the ""Scope"", meaning the amount of land and civilizations. He said the game music for the first part was aweful then it got better. He said the combat was terrible and should be/could be made better for the gamer. He also said the first half of the game, meaning first 4000 years could have been probably removed or somehow made to go quicker. Overall, he was hoping for more of an historically correct game. He feels it is ""historically lacking""."
1,Is it Civ IV or early 80's Atari?,"It didn't crash on me. That's good. It did start and it did run. That's good. But the map is black, can't see terrain, can't distinguish the units, and the cheesy supplemental features (i.e. Mr. Nimoy readings) are the only things that work correctly (most times). Not to mention it plays very slow. My machine meets the requirements easily, yet it feels like a Commodore 64 game.The terrain did manage to become more visible as the game went on, but the fun was gone along with the interest and it was only out of morbid curiousity that I continued to play.And don't bother calling the tech support. They'll hang up on you after a 2 minute hold.DON'T BUY THIS GAME!"
2,great game:IF you can get it to run,"I am a long time Civ fan and enjoyed this game... for the two months i was able to get it to run. It started with a weird blackout view, that I mistakenly believed was the ""fog of war"" but was corrected when i downloaded an update. but even then, it would eventually grind to a halt and force a reboot on my pc. Eventually i uninstalled and reinstalled, with the update and the blackout view returned. The company eventually told me that the video card on my 2 year old dell could not handle this game.For the two months I was able to run the game, it was fun.not for those with laptops or any pc that is not specifically configured for high graphics gaming...."
2,Okay...but buggy,"I tried playing CIV 4 for the first time last night. I also got very frustrated with the bugs in the systems. You had best save you games frequently before it crashes. IT WILL CRASH. It crashed on me after an hour of playing no save. I had before playing added the latest civ patch too (v 52). The new format takes some getting used it. I like some new game modes: automation of worker upgrades, and some other features that make it much simplier. BUT, it cane be frustrating compared to CIV 3 for looking in on cities and unit actions and moving across the screen. I like it but its real buggy."
1,Might be nice if it worked,"This game is buggier than a maggot infested corpse. I tried loading it onto three separate computers all of which exceeded the reccomended requirements. It would not install at all on one. On the other two it loaded but had serious graphics problems, which basically made the game unplayable.2K (the game makers) have issued a patch, but this has only fixed about half of the problems. The game still has serious problems showing movies, and I suspect there is a memory leak which makes it virtually impossible to play on larger maps.I wish game makers would think a little before releasing games that won't run on anyone's computer."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"This game is unplayable. My computer system is only 2 years old, yet it takes over ten minutes for the game to completely load up. Then when it's ready, a fatal crash soon ensues once I try to play.If you are like me, having bought the game at a Target store, you will not even be able to obtain a refund.This is theft, pure and simple. I think a call to my state's Department of Consumer Protection will be well warranted."
1,"Great concept, horrible execution","Civ is supposed to be about playability. The game runs slow on most systems, and if you have a laptop, it probably won't work at all. There are some great graphics, and while they are nice, CIV is a game about straegy, not graphics. Implementation of these graphics, however, has made the game unplayable for most people.If you want to buy it, make sure you hardware supports it fully. Really, however, you should just wait until they release a bunch of patches for it. Wait."
1,Holy Bad Game!! Sid had to work to be this bad!!!!!!!!,Half of the disks sold do not work!! I brought this game on my way to the airport after my mid-tour leave. I got to but one game in a year. When it would not load I tried Email for help - Takes days for a response and the answers are wrong. I called - more wrong answers. I was finally told my disks are bad. I mailed the disks back and they were never returned. Not worth the trouble.
5,Best Civ Game EVER!,"I can't emphasize enough how great this game is. I have played every version of all of the Civilization games (including Alpha Centauri) and this one is by far the best. It's obvious that Sid really took the time to make this one right. There are intelligent enhancements all across the board. Better still, the game is extremely stable. I haven't had a crash in over 50 hours of play. The most bug-free game I've played in a long, LONG time!Great job!"
3,civ4,pretty much a typical sid meiers civ game with a few more bells and whistles. the graphics are not much to brag about.
2,Better if it was more like Civ III,"I have been a Civ 3 player for about 3 years now, and i love the game. Civ 4 is just too different from Civ 3. Its more complicated, a less effective interface, and just completely different from Civ 3.It may have better graphics, but that doesnt make playability.Cons:complicated interfaceDrasticly different from earlier versionsCompletely lost the Civ spiritPros:Better graphics(and thats all)"
4,Over-rated,"I hadn't played Civilization since the first incarnation, and I thought I'd come back and give it another go, since this one was getting such great reviews. I'm a big strategy fan, but I found that something was missing from this game. And very hard to put my finger on it is too.I played it all the way through once, and didn't really feel inspired to start again. It just felt like everything would play pretty much the same, even if it was on a different map. The idea of ramping up the difficulty to make it more interesting doesn't appeal to me, since I feel like it would just be frustrating. Frankly, it was a struggle to get over the boredom to even play through until the end and beat my last competition.I guess overall the game is well presented, educational and relatively deep. The problem I had with it was that I just wasn't having fun. At all. Roll on the arrival of Medieval 2: Total War. I can't see myself playing this one again."
4,"Great game, but look out for bugs","Just adding my two cents. From a game design standpoint, this looks like it will be the best Civ game ever, with dramatic and fascinating changes from previous versions. From that standpoint, this is easily a five-star game. However, the ""minimum"" system requirements are a bit optimistic - my system meets or exceeds each of them, but the game is only marginally playable. My impression is that the ""recommended"" requirements should actually be the ""minimum."" I have also observed some of the crashes and bugs reported by others, which have made playing it a bit frustrating. However, I have no doubt that these will soon be fixed. I would advise holding off buying this until the first couple of patches come out. But don't wait too long, because you'll miss out on the fun!"
5,Great game after patching,"I have played Civilization since their first release, and so far, every new release has been much better than the previous. Civilization IV is no exception. However, I encountered one technical problem. My ATI Radeon 9600 did not work immediately after installation; patches fixed this.I love the gameplay changes they made. Expansion is much more difficult. Great people are much more important, wonders less so. Choosing a government becomes mix and matching civics. The battle system completely changed for the better.I tried playing online with random people, and it's very frustrating. I enjoy taking my time micromanaging my civilization, but so many people who play online have absolutely no patience. So, if you play multiplayer, I recommend to only play with friends through Skype or other voice service because the chat interface is terrible."
5,Addictive & Fun!,This is an excellent game and an easy way to waste a day without knowing that time has passed! As a novice Civ player I was easily frustrated by Civ III but Civ IV is much more user friendly and definitely more fun. Highly recommended!
3,Doesn't live up,"Civilization III just made you feel like you were in command of a large civilization, and that it was real. Civilization III felt real. The graphics in CiV 4 although commendable are just pointless, if i wanted that I would have gotten any old rts game, Civilization is supposed to be something different. I want to feel the whole seriousness when I invade India, instead of feeling like it dosent really matter. For me i liked the many sprawling cities that i possesed in the prior civs, this took it away. The game is an ok game, its just not Civilization. I hope they go back to what it was and forgot the ""eye candy"""
2,"Seems like a fun game, but very unstable","I am not going to take the time to write a full review, mainly because this is my first Civilization game and have only spent a few hours playing so far. It is a fun game, but I still fell pretty lost, VERY complex game (in a good way)!I mainly wanted to echo what others have said about the game's stability. Even after installing the newest patch (1.52) the game still crashes a lot! I played my first game for a few hours before it crashed, installed the patch and then played another with about the same results. My newest game is crashing every 2nd time I build a wonder (about ever 15 minutes or so), I don't know why it is now so much less stable but it is almost unplayable. Auto save is the only saving grace; the game is remotely playable with it (game starts pretty quickly so reloading really isn't as bad as it could be)."
1,Needs a patch like a smoker trying to quit.,"I installed this on two computers. On one, the graphics completely don't work. While there are ways to fix this, they basically involve cheating and revealing the whole map. No no no.On the other computer, the game runs at a snails pace. I have to wait 3 minutes between ACTIONS. ACTIONS, not TURNS. It took me 7 hours to advance 20 turns. This is NOT an acceptable rate.Yuck. Don't buy it until there's a patch."
1,Selling a defective game,"I LOVED CIV 3, and expected to love this more, but I found the game a bit clunky. I'm sure I would have gotten used to the play, but even though my computer meets the recommended requirements, and even though we freed up some memory to make it run faster, the game CRASHES to desktop after about a dozen turns. I can't return it to the store, it won't run, and the customer service was no help. I recommend avoiding this game."
4,"Challenging, turn-based strategy","If you like turn-based strategy games, this is the best there is. There are endless possibilities in this game. It also seems to be historically accurate. If you like real-time strategy, you will be dissappointed. It's all about having the right expectations with this game."
2,If only it didn't crash and freeze it would be the best.,"If it worked properly it would be the best Civ game so far. Graphics, video and overall gaming feel is great. It's the technical side of the game that's not working. I own a brand new computer but still the game is terribly slow to load, both at startup and when loading a saved games. Also it crashes and freezes frequently. I had to reboot my computer 5! times to finish one scenario. Truly not out of Beta"
4,Too Addictive For Me,"Lets just say if you looking to waste hours and hours away at the computer this is your game. Its so addictive, you will find yourself saying just one more turn in no time. The negative for me is that the scenarios are pretty bland and there never is really a rewarding finish to the game. But the aspect of gaining new technologies and resources is very fun. My only complaint is that the interface feels like a application at work and not like a traditional game. I guess thats what happens when you have some many things to micromanage. Overall I liked the game alot, but I don't want to play it anymore because its to time consuming."
1,Nice Job Firaxis......Now if you could just make it playable,"I have an ATI graphics card (Radeon 9800) and it obviously is not supported at all. Even when following the instruction on the Firaxis website the game locks up and is completely unplayable. I am hugely disappointed in the complete lack of respect by Firaxis for its customer base. It's a shame, by all respects this should be a good game (and probably is if you could play it).This is the last Firaxis product that I buy......The rest of my system is as follows:Athlon 64, 3000+1 GB of PC3200MSI K8T Neo MainboardWindows XP Pro with Service Pack 2If you have anything similar, I'd stay away from this game till when/if they fix the game. So much for meeting every requirement....."
2,Don't Bother,"I've been a hardcore CIV fan the entire time these games have been on the market, from civ1 thorugh 3... The latest version, while it has absolutely incredible graphics and sound, is not much more than a rehash of civ3 with a few tweaks. I'm not a fan of the interface, things seemed less ""civ"" to me as I played through. The graphics almost interfered with things, and I got the distinct impression from the game that it didn't want me to pay attention to the incidentals the same way the past civilization games had...This is just my opinion, but people who've been strategy gaming for nearly two decades, as I have, might want to save the cash on this one and play civ3 when you want a strategy fix..."
2,Tough to Install and SLOW on any aging system,"Very slow to install on a desktop that is about 18 months old technology. It requires a huge patch, which is about 40 times the size of the first harddrive I had on my original Windows 3.1 computer many years ago. If you do not have high speed internet connection AND a computer under 2 years old, DON'T BOTHER.Having said that, once you get it up and running it is fairly fun, but runs SLOWLY on my system. My son got it for his 6 month old laptop, and it would not install at all."
1,I didn't pay $40 to beta-test Civ 4,"I am angry that Firaxis released Civ 4 with so many bugs. If you buy this game expect: terrain turning pitch back, units dissapearing, and trees dissapearing.I wish I'd have spent my $40 on a completed version of Civilization 4 rather than this beta work-in-progress mess."
1,Terrible. Could never download it!,I attempted to download this game on 3 different computers with no success!
2,Like Doing Homework,"JESUS GOD!I am a big fan of almost all RTS, but this TBS is like watching the paint dry. Sure you can do very cool things like make nukes, but the gameplay reminds me of integration by parts.I played several games, and they take days to complete. Even after you have built and army to crush your enemy, it still takes about two hours to kill your enemy.I'll admit that I haven't played any other type of TBS, but I have no idea how this won game of the year. Save your money, and play a strategy game that is actually fun, buy Starcraft BW for $10."
3,Harder to learn,This version is much harder to learn than the three earlier versions. I don't really understand the various civics or how to use them.
3,not as good as 3,"Fun game, slightly improved graphics but the loss of some of the features of the 3rd version makes this version more frustrating. If you have a need for increased challenge your civics options just got a whole lot more challenging as well. gone are the democracy, communist, fundamentalist options. Instead they are replaced by a 5 or 6 categories of options that you need to optimize to form your government. It was a little frustrating to be honest for me at first but no its fine."
5,Sid Meier's Civilization IV--excellent!,This was a (wish list) gift for my grandson's 14th birthday. He said he has enjoyed playing the game and it is as good as Sid Meier's previous video games. Amazon makes my shopping so much easier.
4,Solid Game,This is my second copy of this game. I was very surprised with the New Warlord add on. It adds new units people to play as and more scenarios. I was thoroughly impressed and enjoy this Civ game twice as much as any other strategy game I have bought.
1,A total waste of money,"Simply, it does not work. The manufacturer/developer should be ashamed they put this out. They have not to my knowledge addressed the technical problems associated with it on their website as of the time of this posting. Are they truly oblivious to the bugs? Is it that Do they not want to admit fault as to not be liable/accountable for refunding money to those us unhappy with the game? Whatever their reason(s) for not addressing this problem, it is unacceptable, an acknowledgement and a promise of a fix would have been enough, however they have not done this. All they have managed to do is frustrate and annoy a loyal customer base."
1,"Fanboy Antarean, you got it wrong!","I love the Civ games, but I hate the companies that released this one!!Have been playing Civ since my Amiga 500, and every one since..Although I have a less than 6 mnth old PC, and a high spec one at that, I cannot play maps larger than ""Large"" for more than 20-30 turns @ a time, and forget Multiplayer...I got this game on release date... that was more than 5 months ago...Despite all updated drivers, and the latest patch, there are still graphical glitches!!And as for modifying ini files, Antarean, why the hell should I have to do that for???I bought a god-damned game, why should I have to play around with SYSTEM files to make the bloody thing work??And the patch?? The fanboys have been saying ""soon"" for 3 weeks now...You don't buy a car, and then 5 months later, are still tweaking the ECU/gearbox/motor etc etc to make it drive for more than 50 Km without dying!!Get a grip, fanboys.. Or are there Firaxis/take2 PR people lurking here??"
1,Unplayable,"I received this game for Christmas and have had nothing but problems with it. There is a patch on the Firaxis site, but that did not help. The game slows waaaayy down and then will crash. I have a new PC, so that isn't the problem. The game seems to have a memory leak. It gradually uses more and more of the PC's resources and then freezes up.I am very big Civilization fan, but this inferior product is simply not playable. Wait until a new version comes out and check review sites before purchasing."
1,"Great game, will not work on most computers","This game is a big improvement over Civ II and III. I can tell that much by playing at the lowest graphics resolution. It took me hours of fussing around just to be able to do that much. The publisher should be embarrassed that this game was released with so many bugs. So don;t buy this unless you have the latest computer and are pretty savy about the settings. It is a real shame, because I love the previous versions and I know I would love this game."
4,"Better, but still needs improvement","I first played this game about 10 years ago. The newest version in a vast improvement over that version in most aspects. The graphics, sounds and voice-overs (Leonard Nimoy) are new and inviting.The game seems to need a very powerful computer to run smoothly and my computer loses graphic information after saving and re-loading a game. Some of the difficulties I remember on the older version involved keeping the individaul cities happy and un-polluted. These probblems seem to be gone completely and such maintenience is no longer required.It is a complex game and I have found it neccessary to take time to review the situation before continuing play once play has been posponed or when a saved game is re-loaded. Civilization requires patience and strategy. Most likely, younger players used to rapid stimuli and requiring fast hand-eye coordination will be bored."
1,Wait to buy it,Game testing apparently isn't something the makers decided to try. There are literally so many bugs and problems that running this game as intended is nearly impossible. I'm sure they will eventually fix it but save your money now and wait until the designers have fixed a few of the issues.Very disappointing.
3,Not as good as Civ3,"Civ 4 is OK, but not as good as I hoped. The upgrades they made to the game itself are ok, choosing state religion, civics and new buildings/wonders. I think CIV3's battle sequences are better and moving groups of units is somewhat confusing. If you're a big CIV fan, you've probably already bought the game, if you haven't played before - I'd recommend you buy Age of Empires instead."
1,Dont waste your money,Now Ive had the other 3 versions of civilization and thought they were great and assumed this one would be too (well you know what happens when you assume). If you dont have a top end gaming system forget it. My system was above the min requirements and it played horribly. Game play is laggy at best and gets worse the longer you play. In fact it played like a pre release beta like 4 versions away from being retail. Only one patch has been put out since its release and there as been nothing said about a future patch and the tech support sucks. They really didnt add much to the game either compared to civ 3 so over all I dont think it was worth the value. Its too bad Fireaxis had financial difficulties and sold out to a company that is bottom line driven and doesnt care about customer support.
1,Catastrophic Failure,"Similar to other purchasers, I cannot install the game due to a corrupt disk 2. I wish I'd paid more attention to the reviews before making my purchase.I've loved the previous versions of Civ, but in all fairness, I was able to PLAY those versions. I guess it's fair to say that I'm biased in favor of games that will install correctly.I recommend that you DON'T BUY this game. I wish I hadn't."
3,A Series Running Out Of Steam,"I think it is safe to say, after having played all 4 Civs that Civilization III was the pinnacle with Civ 2 behind that. Civilization 4 is pretty but takes a real muscle machine to run. I have the specs to run the game and it should run reasonably well but it just slows down, crawls and crashes. That said, the game is faster with less management but it leads to a dumbed down game play. Civilization is about style with little substance or improvement. I loved Civ 3 for the combat and struggle for dominance which is my reason for playing the game. It seems like it is just too simple in Civ 4. If you don't have days to play this game, why play at all? There are too many technologies that are a waste of time. Can we assume that the Civs already knew hunting, fishing and basic agriculture? The future techs are not much improved. How about some flights of fancy?This is the Civ franchise looking to make more money and milk it for every dollar it can get."
3,Very dissappointed but better than civ 3,The overall game design seems better than civ3 with the addition of religion and a better balance cultural system than civ3. Here is the kicker tho The scenarios that ship with the game upto today 2/6/06 are pretty pathetic. The best one seems to be a small north african ww2 one. That compared to world scope ww2 and ww1 scenarios in civ 1 and 2 that are still readily available. BUY CIV 2 if you want a working game.Also the game is very difficult to create mods and scenarios compared to civilization 2. And if you want to play on a premade map against the ai players it isnt going to happen you have to make a scenario which means you know where the ai civs will be since you have to place them.I think that eventually someone will build a few good mods and scenarios but it could be years. In the mean time I guess I will play civ 2.
1,Also think it is too buggy,"Like many here I've been playing the Civ games since number 1. my machine meets all of the rec specs and I've installed the patch but I still have major crashes and freezes. My install and play discs are also mislabled. While that is a small thing, when you combine it with the obviously less than steller testing and QA, I think we should all get our money back and you can bet the house that I will not be rushing out to buy the next hot title Firixis puts out."
3,Not as good as the last one,"wow... I'm pretty disappointed with this version of civilization. The graphics are superb in civ4 but the ability to actually see your units and ""right-click"" is all but gone. I still find myself lost in where my units actually are. The game play is constantly interrupted with your civilization needing direction and the AI borders on being mentally challenged. The positives are definitely the music, and the religions are a cool new aspect. Unfortunately, I am going back to playing civ3, which frankly plays much smoother and is visually better to understand."
2,"Buggy and no support, wait a little before buying.","The terrain is black with AGP on and white with it off, the 3D heads show up as only eyes and teeth, the city tiles display only 1 or 2 pieces of toast instead of toast/hammers/coins, and the movies are choppy.It's been over a week and there is no word of ever fixing these problems, and take2games does not reply to emails or answer phone calls or at least say ""hang on guys we're working on it""Unless you have a brand new computer wait until they patch this game before buying it."
3,Crashes at the worst time,"Let me add my voice to the multitude and say this game crashes at the worst time. The frequency of crashes seems to be related to the size of the world and the number of units you have going at once, so just when the game is starting to get interesting with lots of armies moving around, it crashes to the desktop in spectacular fashion.I'm fed up with game developers pushing crap out that doesn't work. Just by the number of people complaining about this you can tell this is something that should have been caught in testing. It takes all the fun out when you play a map for two hours and have it bomb out.Update: disappointed over Civ 5 DRM issues, I loaded this game again. With the latest patches, it's quite stable, and very enjoyable."
1,DO NOT BUT THIS GAME! IT DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!!!,"Teach Firaxis a lesson and DO NOT buy this game! I am one of the hundreds with the black map and no faces bug. My system meets all of the minimum recommended requirements to run this game, but who wants to play on a black map. See how many other people have this same problem by doing a search for ""civ 4 black map"" on the interet. This game is a Beta peice of crap!!! I wish I could get my $50 back. I have played Civ for 14 years and this is how they repay my loyalty. Sid Meier is the greatest game designer ever and he should be ashamed that his name is attached to this peice of garbage. BE WARNED....DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Lags and Freezes,"While Civ has always been the most favorite series of mine, this sequel is by far the worst. What good is gorgeous visuals when the game frequently freezes up? When it doesn't freeze up, it will take a good 15 minutes to calculate the computer player's turns before letting you have your round. Or, it will lag up so bad due to memory leak so that you literally have one frame every 5 seconds while you scroll. All this is running on a system way above the recommended specs; having 2 GBs of RAM doesn't help either.A fair verdict would be, buy if you are only gonna play online vs other people. Otherwise, the AI will lag you to death by the latter half of the game when the world is populated and explored.System used: Pentium IV 3.0 GHZ, 128MB GeForce 4, 2GB RAM, 200GB Seagate with 40GB free space."
1,"Performance ""gaming"" PC is must have","CivVI greatly improves the interface and graphics in CivIV and, with a lot more options. However, unless you have a powerful, performance, ""gaming"" PC it is NOT recommended. The game has serious video memory management problems on what is now considered a low end machine (2.5GHz processor with 1GB memory and a GeForce 5500 256MB video card). Once you reach the ""Modern Era"" the game constantly crashes with video memory errors. Until (if/when?) the developers make major improvements with how the program runs and manages memory it is NOT recommended you purchase CivIV unless you are prepared for a great deal of frustration or, have the bucks to spend on a new computer."
1,DO NOT buy this game until technical problems resolved!,We just got Civ 4 for Christmas and have been doing nothing but troubleshooting for 2 days. After searching the web and the user site http://www.civfanatics.com it appears that this game has a lot of video problems that need to be resolved. A lot of people are having problems. We love Civ and hopefully they can get this problem fixed.Do not buy until you can confirm that the developer has fixed these problems.
2,Incessant video problems make game unplayable.,"Like many others, I am experiencing problems with video corruption that makes the game unplayable. I have been responding to automated support emails for over a week and thus far nothing has solved the problems. I have hundreds of other games, and they all work just fine.Unfortunately, the game stinks of 'Microprose' like programming, sorry, Sid."
1,"Hard to install, still harder to get to work!",If I had went to the fan sites and read the fix-it list I would have never bought this game.The recommended hardware/software requirements are the bare minimum.Buyer Be Aware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!04/06/2009 - Got an new computer last Christmas and installed this game. Still had to get some fixes since it was not Vista compatable. Will load the Warlords Extention Pack in the next few weeks.4 Stars for fun3 Stars for overall
2,This game is overly complex,This game plays out like a board game. It's turn based and can be hard to play if you're not used to this type of gameplay (like me). I didn't so much enjoy this game. It's well layed out and can be great fun if you have a great understanding of the paths to take. I couldn't get down a successful pattern though. You have to perform research for your civilization and you have to do so in an effective order or you'll die or just lose another way. There are too many aspects of this game for me to enjoy it.
1,what a disappointment,"As the owner and lover of all the previous Civ games, I trusted that Civ 4 would be just as good as.... .if not better than the earlier versions. It isn't! It is confusing, slow and a total waste of my money.I heard a long time ago that change is not necessarily progress. How true!"
1,Wait until they fix it,"This game was released too early. It has graphics problems, crashes to the desktop, and renders computers to a slow crawl. Don't buy until 2K games produces a patch to fix this game. There are complaints all over the internet. I am a long time fan of civilization games and I am sorry I bought this one."
1,"Beta testing? Yes, you are.","Still in Beta and I want my money back. I'm not paying $50 for a game that is constantly crashing. This game looks and feels great. Too bad it doesn't stay running for longer than about 5-10 minutes. When it goes, it takes the whole computer with it, too."
1,Game does not work. Wait 3 months and buy it for 29.99,"Overall the game is fun, but you cannot play it in Multiplayer, and the during a long game it will dump on you. Its just not ready and I wish I read the reviews before I bought it. Yes its fun but unplayable! I would wait 3 months and buy it for 29.99 if they fix it."
1,Sad disappointment,"What could be a fun game is so riddled with fatal bugs that I've deleted it after one day.The ""solution"" provided by 2K is to run a naked system; no firewall, no anti-spyware, no anti-virus, nothing. Come on people this is almost 2006, no one runs, or should run, a system without protection. I wonder what would happen if I actually wanted to go MP?The graphics are the best yet in the series, the interface is better but not great. But this is a complex game.I had installed the 1.09 patch so these comments are valid for the current version.Too bad I can't get my money back."
1,Glam not Game,"The Civilization series is like the Star Trek movies. Every other one is worth buying - apparently in this case, only the odd numbered sequels. This version adds lots of pretty colors and some interesting additions, but is virtually unplayable.The game is slow and crashes frequently. Going to their website to find out what's up, the fixes are absurd. Such as opening your computer case and moving your video card away from your sound card. Or uninstalling your video drivers and installing older versions.Game players that like this sort of game don't necessarily care if the colors are pretty, or the water is flowing or if Leonard Nemoy is doing the voice over. We want a good, playable game.After much tweaking and trying different things to get the game to work, I have uninstalled it and gone back to Civ III (the best of the series so far). I would recommend NOT buying this version . It isn't worth the aggravation"
1,Do not buy unless your computer is amazing,"This game was definitely not ready for release. Don't even bother playing the game as soon as you install it, go to the website and find out all the patches, software, and system problems you have to fix for the game to even work first. And even after you do all that, it still may not even work, and is apt to random crashes that cause your computer to restart. Honestly, even when I've been able to play the game for more than 20 mins, I think Civ III Complete is actually a better game. Maybe the expansion pack of Civ 4 will improve, but who knows?"
1,Waste of money,"The game simply doesn't start. The company blames bad ATI graphic cards and drivers, but I have a new NVIDIA GeForce card, and the game still doesn't start.Tech support is a joke: if you call Canadian number, the message will say your call can not be completed as dialed; US support will keep you on hold for 15 min, then suggest to visit their web site and quickly hang up.Overall, for me this was a classical example how the combination of incompetent development, management and support can ruin a great game."
1,It is a buggy mess. Don't Buy It!,"1. Most users whose computers meet the software's minimum stated requirements cannot get the game to work properly. [...] It requires a lot more ram and a much better video card than advertised to run. It either crashes or the entire map is black. No fun.2. The tech support leaves a lot to be desired. I was told the problems I was experiencing were due to my video card, even though according to my box the game is supposed to work with GeForce 2 or better (and mine is a GeForce 4). The tech support person told me I had to buy a new graphics card. Unfortunately many people who have followed that advice wasted even more money because the game still won't work on a lot of graphics cards.3. I just wasted $50 and have to wait until the makers of this game release patches to fix the bugs.Do yourself a favor and wait 6 months before buying it. Buy a newer build."
3,If you can get it to work it is enjoyable,"First let me say that this was a pain to get working. I bought it and it didn't work with my system. But the store I bought it at would not allow software returns. So...I purchased a new ATI Radeon video card. It still didn't work. I updated drivers. It still didn't work. Then I found the document on drivers on the support site. Yes you have to update drivers, and then move some files around. Wait a minute. This is fixing an installation problem. The art files are installed in the wrong place by the installation program! Bad...After getting it finally working, I've enjoyed the game. Adding religion and Great People is a big deal and seems to change the game. Ironic that religion could have that much effect and says much in our religiousless liberal society, but that is another topic.Overall, I like the game."
1,"Game Doesn't Install, Buyer Beware!!","There is a well known problem with this game not installing properly. The second disk may require replacement. If you contact Take 2, they will insist that you send the disk to them and pay them $7.50 to fix their manufacturing defect.I strongly recommend you avoid this product at all costs. Having played Civ, Civ 2 and Civ III, I was very hopeful about Civ IV. The failure of the distributor to address the technical problems however is extremely serious. After numerous emails and follow ups, they refuse to correct the issue. Everyone can screw up, and everyone deserves a chance to make things right. That they continue to blame the customer for poor product quality assurance is an outrage however."
5,Love the franchise,I bought this as a gift for someone special since they were always talking about the game. They loved it and recommend it to everyone.
2,"Good Series, Bad Game","I have been a player of the Civilization series for a while now and I am also a big fan of the series. When this game came out I had to get it. Everything was going well until I tried to go online. Immediatly, the game tells me to install a driver. I start installing the driver and when it gets about a forth of the way done, the game shuts down to the desktop. A few days later, I was playing a regular conquest game. Just as I finish building a Great Wonder, my whole computer shuts down. When I reboot, Windows tells me I have just recovered from a serious crash. This would be the best Civilization yet if they had just tested the gameplay a little longer. It seems that they rushed to finish it in order to have it out by Christmas. This is not the work of the Sid Meier that I have grow to love."
1,Endless frustration,"I've played the earlier civs and enjoyed them, but the last few are worthless. The basic levels are fine, but anything beyond that is just ridiculous. Focus on military and it beats you with other civs being more technologically advanced. Focus on science and the other civs will crush you with sheer numbers of their less advanced military force. Try to balance the two and it will engage you in wars of attrition where you spend all your resources trying to defend your territory and some other civ speeds by you in technology. Try to be nice to other civs, and trade technology or resources, and they use it to arm themselves against you. The ""probability"" score is meaningless (anything under 90% and you'll probably lose.) After a while, the whole tanks-losing-to-rifleman bit gets old (and yes I did apply patches.) I suppose it might be more enjoyable if I wanted to spend the next two months studying strategy guides, etc, but there are plenty of other more intersting games out there."
3,OK but nothing spectacular,"The game is interesting/OK, but not really anything to write home about. It is also WAY too difficult, even on the easiest setting."
1,I wish I could give a lower score,[..].I have wanted this game for a long time.I have enjoyed other microprose games like Civ 1 and 2Red storm rising and tank platoon.My last computer crashed after 5 long years of enduringXP I bought a vista machine and realized I could finallyplay Civ 4. How wrong I was. If I were designing a gameI think I might just load it up on a computer beforeshipping it out. Not so with frixas. When I loaded the gamelast night my first frustration came when I could not play it.How silly of me of course you have to load a patch.However the patch says no game can be found. [..]
3,"OK, but past Civilizations are better","The game is fun, but it has periods when it is very annoying. I hate the expense for every city ""feature"". I am a great conquerer, but charging me for cities usually loses me the game as all my units go on strike and then I get attacked simultaneously by three plus civilizations. Always happens just before I wipe out another civilization."
1,crashes in midgame,"Well, I was always a fun of Civilization. But this one dissapointed me greatly. I've run it on my modest laptop with 64M videocard and 1.5 memory and it tends to run out of resources in midgame and crashes. When it does not crash - it runs slowly.Some people are recommending to upgrade the hardware, but it's just ridiculuos. WoW (a real-time, 3d game) is running perfectly on my laptop, but a turned-based strategy Civ4 can not? It's a shame, really. I will never more buy Sid Meyer titles, no more Firaxis games - ever."
1,BAD COPY,I don't know why does Amazon now have the rights to make copies of all of Amanda Miguel's music productions! It is so said to see this happen since who on earth wants to now start owning her music on crappy cd-r's? it is not the same and no one would be proud to have her beautiful music on crappy cd-r's. I really hope no one buys none of these cd's that Amazon are now producing on cd-r's. Don't even know why Amazon is doing this since there are still a few re-issues available recently so who would go from original down to a crappy copy? TERRIBLE!!!
5,awesome hair product!,"My hairdresser told me I should use this and she was totally right! It leaves my hair feeling great! Only drawback is that it doesn't smell very fun, kind of an old lady hair product smell. But it works so I'm not complaining!"
3,What is real?,"Hal Jordan is thrust into the recesses of his own mind in order to pass a test all Lanterns must undergo; after all, they wield a weapon that works on sheer willpower. The artwork left me cold at times, but it is surreal and vivid: giant floating heads, six-armed women, aliens of all shapes and sizes. The ""Doc Giesel"" joke was nice, too."
1,Wrong tools were shipped,"I chose to provide a 1 star rating due to I received the wrong tool. Because of being shipped the wrong tool, I missed my race that weekend. You sent me a coned tap instead of a bottoming tap."
3,Wolo 375 - Short and Sweet,"The Wolo 375 Record-a-Horn is a fine product that does almost everything as advertised. All the necessary recording and playback hardware is included. The speaker volume is excellent, but tinny as is characteristic of most horn type speakers. The unit I received only records a 17 second sound bite, not the 30 seconds as advertised. While Wolo was quick to respond to product questions prior to the sale, they did not respond about the shortened time."
1,This item is a cheap piece of junk,"Horrible line-in sound quality. Barely better with the mic.If you ""honked"" this horn at someone when you drove by, they would think that a giant static noise generator was about to crush them to death.What a dissapointment."
2,"Decent for the price, but not quality by no means","Sound quality is subpar and it really needs a noise suppressor to even be useful (bad alternator noise bleeds through), but for the price it's somewhat decent quality and does the intended job."
1,......wow,"simply put, terrible. it DOES NOT SHOOT 190 FPS it is accurate up to about 10 feet maybe. only reason it deserves even one star is because i got it with 2 clips nad it came with 500 BBs. it cuves up in fine weather. just dont get, not worth $."
3,No todos los exitos,"Esta banda mezcla el buen rock and roll de los 6o's y el folk, un cantante con voz grave y melodica completan el pastel musical. Mi primera vez que oi a los gabinete fue con el cd de 1987 llamado ""Camino Soria"", este album fue el despegue en su carrera canciones como ""Suite Nupcial, ""La sangre de tu tristeza"", ""La Fuerza de la costumbre"", ""Como un pez"" son de lo mejor, luego vendria el Album ""Privado"" de donde se extraen ""Palabra de honor"" y ""amor de madre"" que no es lo mejor del disco con un estilo mas rock en el cual dejaron de lado el folk clasico que le dio el toque intimista del Camino Soria. El mayor error de esta compilacion fue no incluir el tema ""camino Soria"", su mejor cancion a mi entender, una joya tanto por la letra como por la musica."
3,Lo mejor de Gabinete es anterior,"En realidad, lo mejor de Gabinete es anterior. Los discos que hicieron para dro/tres cipreses son mucho más originales, ácidos, violentos, románticos, etc. La mejor canción de GC es Cuatro Rosas, que no aparece en esta recopilación. Desde el cambio de cía el único disco personal es Camino Soria, que es muy recomendable."
4,Not bad but not perfect,Charger is a good deal which also support syncing. It needed to have a sync button though to be a 5.
1,I haven't had a chance to use it.,"I received a broken sync & charge, sent it back shortly after Christmas, and still have not received a replacement."
2,Drilling Tip came off,"I bought this product mostly to drill and remove the blue rocks/boulder from my property. I used dexpan non explosive demolition agent to break the rocks into pieces. First I drill on the boulder no farther than 8 inches apart to the desired path of the crack. Then mix the dexpan with water according to the instruction, then pour it to the drilled holes. After drilling 3-4 holes continously, the carbide tip came off.I dont think this product is meant for drilling rocks. I returned the product and I bought Dewalt and hopefully this will do the work."
2,Disappointing,I was so disappointed in this book. It is VERY short and doesn't contain really any more information than I was able to get from the PMI website. It was way to expensive to be so limited in information. I was expecting much more information about the exam than it contained. : > (
1,Not much here. . .,"As a PMI volunteer who teaches in PMP Exam Prep classes, I bought this book thinking it would be useful in refining our study course. Nope. There's not much here. It was VERY disappointing.I'm assuming that it is also out of date, since it was written prior to the release of the PMBOK Guide 4th ed. and has not been updated.I also hoped for some information on how PMI determines whether the PMP exam is valid, but there's nothing in here about the development or any statistical information on the exam.I really can't think of a single reason to buy this."
1,Examination Specification Review,Tells how/why questions are populated on the exam. Does not necessarily help you focus your study efforts any more than the free PMP handbook on the PMI.ORG website.
4,Good book on Silat philosophy,"I would just like to share my thought about this book. If the reader just looks at the book briefly and pay attention to the illustration, the reader can conclude it is a book geared towards children. If an adult reader reads and think more deeply about the writing, the true meaning of the book surfaces. The book is filled with philosophy that silat practitioners can trully appreciate. On one hand, If you are looking for illustrations on Silat techniques, this book is not for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for philisophy of Silat then I highly recommend this book."
3,DVD & VHS Movie Player,"I'm happy with this combo.With my Target Trutech I couldn't watch any of the new music videos and DVD movies; This combo plays them all.Has all the standard features and some nice ones I like.EZ view allows a one button push for viewing DVD movies as a standard, widescreen, fit, zoom...Useful VHS search features such as fast forward/back to the zero counter. Or doing a search that will pause and show each spot recorded on the tape.Good quality remote!There's no TV tuner so you cannot directly record TV to VHS. But as mentioned before you could patch it (connecting your old VCR) but its not as convient as having one already built in.It may not play your home movies on CD-R, since it only plays the newerformats: MPEG4 and DIVX.Overall, I'm satisfied for fact that I'm watching current Movies, music videos, an occasional recording off the TV and all at an affordable price for a combo."
3,Disappointed,I bought this as a replacement for one I had had for several years. One feature I do not like is the fact that there is no pause button on the VCR.
1,Poor quality and warranty,"Bought it slightly over two months ago just to be able to play our old video tapes, and now there is no video output from the VCR section, even though I can still play the DVDs. Samsung warranty is only 3 months labor and 1 year parts, so I was just barely within the warranty period. If it breaks down again, the repair cost might be more than the cost to purchase a better quality unit."
1,Samsung DVD/VHS not a good choice,"I bought the DVD player and it will play for a couple of months and stop. You won't be able to take it back to it's place of purchase. Samsung will drag their feet about getting you the information to send back the product. They gave me a tracking number but never called me back. I faxed them the receipt twice, they say they will not accept a mailed in receipt - it has to be a fax or an email, but they say they have no email address. Now they want me to get a better receipt from Frys to send to them before they will repair the unit. I went to Walmart and bought a Magnovox. So far, I like it better, but it has not been a month yet."
3,average,"The story of Supreme, Mike, and Vince, who were grew up best friends. This is the story of their life after highschool. I felt the novel would have been better if it didn't move so fast, and that the reader should have gotten to know more about other characthers in the book."
3,"Okay, I guess","I agree with the previous reviewer. The characters in the book did not act in a very realistic manner. The main character didn't react to certain situations in the way I would have expected, given her age. The main character is jealous because her older sister has been spending a lot of time with her boyfriend and not enough time with her. The girl worries about her sister and regularly snoops in her sister's diary to learn the details of her relationship with her boyfriend. Her sister knows about the snooping and is angry with her about it. The climax occurs when the girl reads something particularly disturbing in the diary, and she must decide what to do about it."
3,Not very realistic,"I read this book a few weeks ago, and I have to say that it was not very realistic. The main character Haley, is in fifth grade and she has a club with her friend Anna and they vow to never like boys. I started liking boys when I was in 3rd grade! Also, Haley thinks that her sister doesn't love her anymore because she is always out with her boyfriend, Gary."
2,Doesnt really excel at anything,"Sol Bianca is a watchable little series about a crew of women and a stow-away young boy on a super-ship called the Sol Bianca. The characters lack development, and what little their is becomes very cliche' . The hardcore, kill-em-all, short haired male hating woman was once a model that got screwed over for some reason or other. The captain is a drunk, the computer geek is a cyborg in secret and the stow-away is son to a rebel leader. As cookie-cutter as this movie may be, its worth a rent but not a purchase."
3,Decent reading.,The book was interesting. After reading the book of Castner's explorations in Alaska I would find it hard to believe that Lt. Castner would ever have a part in letting a boy go along on the exploration. Castner was a very strict man believing in discipline at all time.It was enjoyable to read.
4,New Edition Coming Out in 2013,"There is a Third Edition that is due to be published in 2013. The First Edition came out in 1980. The Second Edition came out in 1989, and was updated in 1994, I believe.This is a great book and I highly recommend for Greek-American studies. Covers almost everything about the Greeks in the Americas: from the theory that Christoper Columbus was a Byzantine Greek noble from Chios (thus the possibility that the Greeks discovered America), the 1760's Greek colony in Spanish Florida of 'New Smyrna,' and so on.This Second Edition is dated and could have covered a lot more ground. But it's value is still recognized. Not intended to be a comprehensive history of Greeks in the Americas, I suppose."
2,"classics, yes; abridged, yes.","No avid music collector could call his/her album complete without at least a small selection of historical classics in category of orchestra and symphony. If You're just looking for a sample, the quantity in 101 Classical Greats is sure to fit the bill. If you're looking for true quality however, you will be better off looking for compilations by individual authors, as this collection is abridged, its multiudous tracks containing little more than three or four minutes, each, of the actual symphonies. A true fan will be sorely disappointed when, for example, Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings cuts out and moves to the next track, mere seconds before the beginning of its hallmark climax."
3,Doesn't compare to other devotional books I've ordered,"It's ok but a huge disappointment...My husband and I had just finished Nightlight Devotions for Couples which we loved. God's Little Devotional Book for Couples is an inadequate replacement. It does not provided detailed or truly helpful devotions. The devotions are much too short and offered no discussions/questions for the couple. I may use it as a gift in a church gift exchange or book donation, but we have no desire to read this book together."
3,Not great...,"I bought this bra and prompty returned it. I really, really wanted to love this bra. But when I opened it, it was just about as frumpy as most other nursing bras out there.First of all, their sizing seems to run large, and the fabric isn't very forgiving. When I tried it on, I had extra fabric on the cups that just sat there, all creased up. If you order this, try a cup size down.Secondly, it isn't very low-cut, and when I tried a tank over it, you could see the tops of the cups hangin' out and the thick straps were unslightly. Now, it could be that my size (36DD) is uglier than smaller sizes...The good: the fabric was soft and felt nice, and it had a nice wide band of elastic for the ribcage. If you want to avoid an underwire, that's the best you can hope for."
5,Completely complete!,"Anyone who enjoys camping MUST have this ""bible""! It lists campsites from all over the USA, as well as rates them. It tells you how many sites are available, as well as electric, sewage, and water hookups!A definite must-have for any camper!"
3,Have a question,"Hello I have a questionI have two laptops, one External Hard drive, usb printer, and a pc. i would like to share files among these computers send it to the printer and all. I don't mind havinf wired. My question is what is the best choice? Hub? Switch? router? i don't know the difference. and i don't want to spend over $50. can someone please make recommendation, how to hook these devices and computers up together? maybe suggest a product? Thank you for your time."
3,Only 4 usable ports,"This is advertised as a five port switch. However, one of the ports is used to connect to the modem. As a result, you are left with only four usable ports. I had another product previously that I replaced after three years. It was a five port switch but it had another port to connect the modem so it had five usable ports. This is what I thought I was buying based on the description. The device works fine and is a good product. If you need all five ports, you should get another product."
1,NOT a gigabit Ethernet switch,"Electronics > Computers & Accessories > Networking Products > Switches > ""gigabit ethernet switch"" lists this device. It is NOT a gigabit Ethernet switch, but only 10/100. I returned it."
1,Unuseful!!!!!!!!!!!!,I thought this product would allow me to run my X-Box 360 and Laptop on the internet so that I could stream movies from Netflix. It is the most un-useful product i've bought inthe last 5 years! You need a router to run the setup that I require. There need to be more info. on such products so that first time users do not WASTE THERE MONEY. Also there is a long standing policy about electronics that if it is open It cannot be returned So I am out $ 25.00 on this product. I'm just lucky I din't buy a more expensive product!
2,"Cuts out randomly, needs reboot.","I have had this switch for many years, and recently it has been cutting out. I have a desktop PC, PS3, Xbox 360, and Samsung HDTV connected to it now, and often when I turn my computer off then back on, the switch does not work until I unplug it and plug it back in.I realize the device is positively ancient, but this should not happen."
3,Same problem with power cord not staying in,Also purchased one in September 2010. As two other reviewers have noted...The power cord will not stay in. The slightest movement is enough to break contact and power off the device. Tried electric tape to keep it in -- no luck. Weight of device weighing down the plug to keep a good contact seems the only way it will work.That is not a long-term solution.
5,"Simple, yet perfect","This device may look simple, and that is because it is. you just hook it up and volia! Internet to all your devices, just don't forget to get a good router! When it comes to networking I am not the brightest, but these were easy to figure out how to use and so far they work great. They seem very sturdy and the wall mounts make they easily accessible. We have two, one connected to the pcs and one that we use to connect all our gaming devices."
2,Check review dates: Latest batch has defective power connection,"The units I received cannot be used in a reliable installation. I received my FS105 v2 this week (in September 2010), and as another reviewer from this month noted, the power connection is flaky. The power cord disconnects, and the unit powers off, whenever I move either the unit or the cord. I returned my first one for a replacement, and the second unit has the same problem, so it's going back for a refund. The serial numbers from my defective units are 1D52073B01659 and 1D52073G02579.Thank you Amazon for your excellent return/replacement procedure."
5,Netgear Switch is Great,"This switch is great. Since my house is pre-wired for an ethernet network, within 5 minutes, I had all my rooms in my whole house on the network. Verizon hooked my FIOS internet router in my basement. Merely connected one port of the router to the network wall jack closest to the router which was wired into the Verizon patch panel in my garage. Just had to place the Netgear switch on a shelf in the patch panel, plug it in to the electric outlet, plug in the ethernet connection coming from router and then each of the connections from the living room and the 3 bedrooms. Voila -- all connected to the router and to the internet."
5,Works Well,My wife needed to add another computer in her office and this turned out to be a simple plug and play. She is on a network so additional equipment wasn't needed.
5,Best switch out there,"This Netgear switch is the best value out there. I use this model for my job quite frequently. Very reliable and durable. Installation is a no-brainer, just plug it in and forget its even there."
5,Great switch!,"Got this little switch to go in my living room so I could connect my AV Receiver, PS3, and Directv DVR. Setup is a no brainer and the quality of this little unit is superb!"
4,5port switch,"WOW! Exactly what I needed. I bought this to hard wire my XBox 360 and my PS3. Very easy install. I actually waited a day to install so I could ask our tech guys at work if I was reading instruction correctly. It really is simple. Plug in source, plug in what you want, plug it into the wall. DONE! Great deal especially with $10 rebate makes final cost less than $20."
4,Easy install!,Plug and play . . . . .literally. Super-easy to install and plays well with other network equipment. Liked it so much I bought it's bigger brother too.
3,Works Great!,Needed some additional ports from an outlet and it solved the issue with no wiring. Works great right out of the box.
1,Netgear Switch,"Junk, Only one ethernet port worked. Tech support sucked. Will stay away from net gear. Purchased a china model for 10.00 cheaper and it works great."
2,LED lights and Ethernet ports on same side causing problems,"Durable. I have plugged in three computers into this 5 port switch and all of them work fine. With the Ethernet cards installed in all my systems, I found the installation to be a cakewalk. The configuration is so simple and it just takes a few moments of your time. I just had to plug in the power cable first then connected the Ethernet cables of all the comps and it was ready. But it needs an external power supply chord and does not have a power on switch. The metal casing makes this device quite heavy. Not that I carry it around all the time but it could have been of lesser weight.The LED lights and the Ethernet ports are on the same side. This is a major disadvantage for me because the wires flow on my desk. Had the ports been at the back I would have had some control in keeping my desk uncluttered.My FS105NA also gets warm after continuous usage for more than an hour."
3,"Product works, but not in my implementation","I'm planned to use the 2 I bought in a networked audio setup at my church, based on recommendation from the other product vendor. Unfortunately, I don't think they fully understood what I wanted to do. So, I keep them for spares and continue to swap cable connections manually."
3,Read the fine print (maybe not so fine),"A perfect good Ethernet switch but I didn't see the it is only 10/100 Mbps. So it is the bottleneck in my network. I now use it as an extra switch if I need additional temporary connections. It states ""Every port supports up to 200 Mbps in dedicated bandwidth"" but I could verify this.Pros:- Very reliable- Small footprintCons:- Only for 10/100 Mbps networks- No indicator light on front (non cable side since this is not rack mounted)- Rubber feet tend to fall off"
3,"A Cheap Switch, No Surprises","I purchased this switch originally for my home. Back when Xbox 360's came without a wireless card (FOR SHAME, MICROSOFT!), I needed a switch to run my tiny home network of a PC, laptop, PS3, and Xbox 360.The switch works as advertised, great for home networks where you receive a residential internet connection <= 100 mb/s. However, if you're going to hook up a couple computers at school or work, you can get more out of a 10/100/1000 switch instead for a slightly higher investment. The major downside to trying to network with a switch directly from your ISP is that sometimes it can be complicated to assign IP addresses and DNS manually on an Xbox 360 or PS3. A router will automatically assign IP addresses, but a switch is an ""unintelligent"" device - it just passes the signal through.Make sure that you're getting the right product for your network. If this is it, it won't fail you."
5,"Amazingly Simple, Easy, and Rugged","This is by far the simplest, fastest, easiest installation of network equipment I've ever done. Even the box was easier to open than most (open top instead of slide-out like all the crap I usually end up with).This switch is nice and heavy - has a very solid, rugged feel. Don't know if it will hold up for years, but it looks like it could be around longer than me. No cheap plastic here.Took it out of the box, plugged it in, and hooked it up & I was golden <1min total setup time, and no problems.Likes:-Price (I got it for $9 after rebate)-Durability-Size (very small - they did a good job being space-efficient).Dislikes:Didn't come with a pony"
4,Ethernet Desktop Switch,"Had problems with my internet not reaching the back area of the house, this switch helped with my problem. Thanks"
4,Simple and straight forward,"Having used ethernet for a number of years, I have accumulated a collection of switches and routers. Since they are such simple devices, I was surprised to learn that they do break/burn out. After testing my old devices, I purchased two of these Netgear switches to handle the array of ethernet connections now required for the current home entertainment systems. So far, so good."
3,"Quite expensive for what it does (basic switch, no routing)","Bought this item to connect my TV, Time Capsule, Apple TV and computer using Ethernet wire to the cable modem provided by Comcast (Arris TM722G). This just doesn't work. Because, even if it's expensive, this switch is just a basic switch and doesn't provide DHCP or NAT. So it has to be put BEHIND A ROUTER to work and give access to internet to several devices, although it wasn't stated anywhere in the description provided by Amazon and Netgear, or in the user manual. And the modem provided by Comcast (Xfinity) is just a plain modem, not a router.So if you're in my case, it's a much better option to buy a router (can be found around 30$) which will also provide the switching capability, 4 ethernet plugs, and even WiFi (actually it's very difficult these days to find a router that doesn't provide WiFi)."
1,"Only lasted 6 months, then no sign of life","Worked fine for six months, then no sign of life. We'll see if Netgear will stand behind lifetime warranty, but what a hassle fo $30 item."
3,Works great,"This switch is basic and it works just fine, it is a great value for the price that I paid."
5,great little product,"the less there is to say about a switch the better. Thus, i'll just say that the build quality is solid, metal not plastic, and i've yet to have a problem."
4,Solid Switch,"Bought this to replace a Dynex switch I got at Best Buy for $32. The Dynex was plastic and felt cheap. I love that this NetGear switch has a metal body. It feels like better construction overall, and at $12 less, it's a great deal. All the ports work exactly as expected.My only complaint is that the power plug and the RJ45 jacks are on opposite sides of the switch. This may not matter to you, but for me it was slightly annoying because the switch sits in an entertainment center just like a DVD player or a set top box. It would be nice if all the cables came out of the same side so everything could be together, but it certainly isn't a deal breaker.I would definitely buy this again."
5,"Great switch, great price","I've had this for a few months now and it still works perfect. I'd have no reason to think why it would not continue to function perfectly. It is built nice and solid. It was $19.95 I believe, with a $10 rebate which I received right away. If you need a simple switch for your home office, look no further."
5,Two Thumbs UP !,"I have to eat some crow....My first review of this NetGear ProSafe FS 105 was flawed......After some extensive troubleshooting on my network, I discovered that my LinkSys BEFSR41 10/100 router was at fault.There had to be another reason why my new NetGear FS 105 switch wouldn't connect to my router.I have two of them and both would not connect.The only way I could get it to connect to my router was to place it behind a 10 Mbps hub.... dah ?Troubleshooting this further, I directly connected the FS 105 to my cable modem, completely bypassing the router and the results were astonishing.....I more than QuinTupled my Verizon Internet Speed Test from a low of 3 Mbps to 17.5 Mbps.I had no idea my old router was the bottleneck.....As much as I was initially dismayed with the FS 105, the problem was my equipment, not NetGear.I will now replace my LinkSys BEFSR 41 with a blazing fast Net Gear router.....10 thumbs up for NetGear...."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I'm somewhat disappointed it Netgears quality control. All that needs to power the unit down is to bump it. The switch side of the transformer has a weird fit to it. It has to be pushed in very tight like something is holding it back. Once in, it works fine until even a slight bump will dislodge it and power the unit off. It's out of the way now so it doesn't get bumped and works fine. It was kind of a pain while setting my system up and moving things around but now that it's stable, it's fine."
5,good product,This thing is small so you can put it almost any where you would like.It works good I have my ps3 and computer hooked up to it and it has no lag when running both at the same time.
4,Does the job,"If you need to add a few ports, this is perfect. Price is great and it does the job. Simple."
5,Excellent switch.,I trust Netgear products. I had several Netgear products and everything works great. No complain at all. More devices I was able to connect with this switch and still get excellent Wi-Fi connection from my router.
3,Two times Three (stars),Both films were fun and clever. The Limey's flashbacks and Ghost Dog's street smarts made both film a good time. No disappointments here.
1,Burned Cat,I put this on my cat and it has burned her. She now also has bald spot where it was applied. The fragrance is really strong and piney and it lingers. I would NOT recommend this for anyones pet.
1,Terrible product,"I applied this product as directed on my chocolate lab 2 weeks ago. 6 days ago, I took her into the woods, and to a farm pond. So far I have pulled 20 ticks off of her.I have used Frontline the past 4 years and have never had any tick or flea problems."
1,DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!,"This product gets negative numbers from me.I put this product on both of my cats for fleas. They ran around for awhile, clearly uncomfortable. After about 20 minutes their skin became inflamed at the the application site. I immediately called my vet who told me that all of the oils in the product are TOXIC to cats and that I should bathe them immediately with Dawn dish soap to get it off. After 3 baths, I can still smell it on them but it is no longer on their fur and they are not at risk for ingestion.This product should be taken off the market. It could have killed my cats within days. The oils can't be digested by kitties and it builds up in their livers, eventually killing them.DO NOT EVER USE ANYTHING LIKE THIS ON YOUR CATS."
1,Does not work,"Bottom line--the product didn't work. That should be enough to stay away. The smell is very strong, but not horribly unpleasant, like citronella. I used it on my 3 cats about a week ago and the cats are still spiky haired/oily and there are still live fleas. One cat did start foaming at the mouth, so I wiped him down the best I could, but he was so freaked out by the stuff that I could barely get near him. My semi hairless got a scab on her back and flaky skin all around. Purchased @ PetSmart. I stupidly assumed that any product sold at a pet store and created for cats should be safe for them. Sorry, kitties. I should have done more research when the product I really wanted to purchase and had researched wasn't available. I was just in a hurry to take care of your problem and get you healthy."
1,Horrible!!!!,Both of my cats were burned by this product. One of them developed a large bleeding wound on the back of their neck where I applied it and she was freaking out because of the smell and the pain!! She lost a lot of hair. I was checking this product to see if anyone else had a bad experience with it and sure enough...everyone has! Stay away from this stuff!!!
1,This stuff is dangerous,"I bought this to use on my cat and my daughter's two cats. The day after I applied it to my cat, she got so sick I had to take her to the emergency veterinary hospital. She was lethargic, and it turned out she had a fever, red skin where the product had been applied, and respiratory distress. One of my daughter's cats developed bare skin patches along the line where the stuff was applied. I wanted to avoid the neurotoxins found in traditional flea/tick preventatives like Frontline and Advantage, but this isn't the way to do it. In addition, the smell is very strong and can be smelled from a room away, and may cause anyone with respiratory problems such as asthma to have a reaction. DON'T BUY IT!"
1,THIS WILL KILL YOUR CAT!!!!,"Don't use this product. We did and the vets said it is toxic. My cat ended up with kidney failure soon after we applied this to him. He had been given this once a month like it says on the directions and he would try to get away when we applied it. It would smell for days, but he would get really sick. We thought it was a natural product so we kept using it. When he finally got really sick, we took him to the vets and found out he had kidney failure. That was a week ago and he passed away yesterday. I would like to sue them. This product is toxic, just ask your vets or even a holistic pet center. We got 2 separate opinions. One from an animal hospital and also one from a holistic pet center. DON'T USE THIS PRODUCT. It will poison your pet."
4,works great for my allergic cat,"I have a cat that is not only allergic to fleas, but also the chemical repellents, so this is a great alternative for him. It has no adverse effects on his sensitive skin. I will say it seems to be effective for only a couple of weeks and not a full month, so I usually apply it every 3 weeks. I love the smell - it's so much better smelling than the chemical brands! Haven't tried the spray, so can't comment on it. People need to remember animals are like people - some have sensitivities where others don't."
1,This product killed my cat!!,"I used this product on my cat in October. I should have noticed she was immediately uncomfortable, but I was naive and trusted the ""natural"" claims on this product. A few days later her fur came off and her skin appeared burnt. She then became lethargic, stopped eating, and couldn't use the bathroom. I took her to the vet and she died a day later. This happened within 3 weeks of using the product. I blame myself for being naive, and have been back and forth with the SENTRY company - they are taking NO responsibility. DO NOT use this product!! See a vet for a flea/tick medicine."
1,DO NOT PUT THIS ON YOUR PET,"I give this one star because it is not possible to give negative stars. Sentry Natural Defense is terrible! I used it on 2 of my cats and they hated it. They scratched until they bleed, cried, lost hair, had dandruff and were mad at me for weeks. Not to mention the smell is terrible. If you do not want to use a product that has toxins in it ask your vet. Their are non-toxic flea meds that work 100x better and don't hurt your animal. This stuff should be taken off the market."
1,Irritated my cat's skin,"I bought this at a national pet store chain because a woman who works at a shelter recommended it. The smell of peppermint was so overwhelming that my cat went ballistic trying to get away from the smell. Also, the product stays on the skin and fur...24 hours later my cat looked like a punk rocker because the product had semi-dried his fur into spikes. I couldn't touch my cat without getting the stuff on my hands, and now I will have to clean my house because the stuff was wiped off onto the couch, blankets and carpet. Other products absorb into the skin and dry soon afterwards, but not this stuff. Worst of all, I just noticed the product has irritated my cat's skin. The skin on the back of his neck is red and inflammed, and you can tell its uncomfortable for him. I don't know how well this stuff kills fleas, but it's not worth it for me. I don't want something that is going to irritate my cat. I would highly recommend skipping this producted and using a vet recommended one."
2,Disappointing sound.,"I picked up this pair of small, attractive speakers the other day with high hopes. They're really nice looking and simple. But the sound quality was atrocious. We get richer bass and a less tinny overall sound out of the free speakers that came with a much (MUCH) cheaper all-in-one boom box than we did with these JBLs on a state-of-the-art Harman/Kardon receiver. I was really, really disappointed."
4,Great Outdoor Speakers,"Truely rich sound from these small outdoor speakers that allow you to tune in, turn on and drop out."
2,"Whoa, What a Disappointment","Since Jeff Fahey co-produced this one, I thought maybe he was after morequality and to escape his B Movie status.I was wrong.Or maybe not. Maybe he simply can't do it. His actor's emotional range is limited to anger, comic, dead calm, action. He fell very short in any scene that was meant to convey emotion, and always has.Don't get me wrong. I like Jeff Fahey and have for a long time. Since Lawnmower Man. Even now, with his wild gray hair and beard, he is still one of those men you could ...uh, well,....never mind.I fully expected a good old fashioned tear jerker, or at least something that touched the heart. But it lacked heart. No strength to the building of characters, nothing to grab at you and hold you into sticking with the story.I just wish they wouldn't make B Movies. If you're going to do it, do it well."
5,Sounds fresh after all these years,"I really only expected to get some good driving music out of this CD, so I was pleasantly surprised when I found it to be much more. It was great to revisit the stuff I listened to in high school. Sure brought back some good memories. Great sound, great voice and a lot of fun!"
4,GREAT BUT NOT ALL THE BEST!!!,"WELL, I HAVE A NEW CD WITH ALMOST THE SAME MUSIC IN OTHER COMPILATIONS, THE SOUND IN THIS EDITION IS GREAT AND ARE INCLUDED ALL HER FAMOUS SONGS, BUT WHERE ARE; DINNER WITH GERSHWIN, CARRY ON, WORK THAT MAGIC AND MELODY OF LOVE? I GUESS THOSE SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED AS VERY BEST. ANYWAY THIS COMPILATION INCLUDE TWO BRAND NEW JEWELS;THAT'S THE WAY IT IS AND I WILL LIVE FOR LOVE AND THE REMIX OF MY FAVORITE; YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL."
2,i have not received this cd!,"please check with vendor because i have not rece4ived this cd, yet. I am anxious to receive before I purchase future items."
4,70s overdrive...,"I love Donna Summer. Think her disco hits have been compiled to the extreme. Check out her 80s hits like ""All Systems Go"", ""There Goes My Baby"", ""Supernatural Love"", ""Cats Without Claws"", ""Dinner with Gerwin"" and more. Her 80s music were more Flashdance-like. Hope WEA company would look into her 80s anthology someday."
5,Fantastic .. Donna Summer album all the hits,"Thanks for sending this album in record time. The album is absolutely fantastic. I always followed Donna Summer. I have a few other albums of hers. This one is really special, What i would like to maybe hear is the songs Hot Stuff and Bad Girls syncronised as in the original album but it is still fantastic. I would recommend this to any person that likes dance music and an awesome voice. I now need to find a DVD of Donna Summer that matches this album in sound and quality.When are you commin to South Africa?"
5,You're so beautiful,"juste excellent. le rythme est top, la voix sublime, le mixage impec, bref fabuleux."
5,What a Journey!,Anyone who enjoyed Donna Summer will love this CD. I have played it over and over. It is also great as an exercise CD without it being boring. Love it!!!
2,My journey,I returned this CD because I did not like the song mix. I do like Donna Summer but this mix was not as good as previously purchased CD's
2,She was better than this....,If these were her best recordings then I don't agree with the producers choices.It just didn't do it for me...it wasn't worth my limited financial resources.
4,Another collection ... why?,"This is a good choice of songs, covering 1975 to the present. The sound quality is fabulous. However, the question arises ... do we REALLY need yet another greatest?There are other great ones out there (the Anthology & even the new Bad Girls Deluxe Edition is better suited ... that has the 12"" versions) & if you find it on Ebay get the Walk Away collection (greatest covering 1977-1980; 45 versions here but the song listing is outstanding).This is just another way to say that Donna has a new album out ... please. I love Donna just as much as you all do (if you didn't you would not be reading this), but the repackaging of all the hits again & again gets old ... hopefully this will be the last time..."
