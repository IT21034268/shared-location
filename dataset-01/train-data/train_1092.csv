1,This is nothing more than the Bible teaches.,"I feel that this book is not worth the lead and gun powder to destroy this book. James Ray one of the people quoted in this book really made me realize that the truth is in God's word, and it's not a secret! After his sweat lodge of death incident, I learned that man in general will fail you but God never changes and promotes life on earth and life eternal. God's laws and commandments were here long before the law of attraction was conjured up by Rhonda Byrne."
5,Amazing book!,"This book helped me tremendously, it's basically thinking positive. Whatever you choose to think you shall bring upon yourself. An example could be with a young man wanting to talk to a gorgeous girl, if he THINKS positive and that he has confidence it will reflect in his actions and he can have anyone he wants. Whereas if he thinks negatively he will attract negative objects and reations. This book he me significantly.A MUST BUY FOR ALL OPTIMISTS!!!"
1,A Long Commentary on One of Buddha's Sutras,"Buddha's first sutra in the Dhammapada:""We are what we think.All that we are arises with our thoughts.With our thoughts we make the world.""The Secret is a long commentary on those three lines."
2,Not a secret at all,"More like positive reminders than telling a secret. Scary part is that it leaves God out of the picture. After I watched the dvd, I was not at all impressed, it seems too ""self centered"". Too much ""me..me..me...""....I wouldn't recommend it. Dale Carnegie revealed a much more useful secret, read his books and the Bible if you want a rich life."
1,"A rehash of an OLD ""Secret""","Just buy the little booklet called ""IT WORKS"" by HJ written in 1920 and you will get this book in a nutshell. Because that does ""work."" Why waste $$?"
5,Excellent Audio,The Secret DVD was life-altering for me! The audio is a PERFECT follow-up and something that I can have in my car when I need God-inspired wisdom. Absolutely incredible!
1,How to be misled quickly,"The premise is simple. Think good thoughts, motivate yourself and stay motivated. The downside it the individualistic, anti-spiritual isolation you will experience."
1,"What ""Secret""???","I'm tempted to shout, ""liar, liar, pants on fire!""....there is absoulutely nothing new in this silly book...in fact, she has harvested all of her ideas from far better sources."
1,Here's the REAL Secret..............,"The wealth that is bestowed on the small percentage of people in this world is acquired through heredity, ingenuity, hard work, or just dumb luck.No one obtains wealth or cures cancer by simply obsessively wishing for it.The first step in increasing your wealth is to take the money you would have spent on this mindless drivel, and put it in your pocket. See? You're doing better already..............."
5,AWESOME!!,"This book is a great. Everyone should read this book because I believe it puts your life into perspective, it allows you to become more conscience about things you would of otherwise overlooked. If you want to change your life, your way of thinking, then read this book. The only thing I didn't particularly like is the constant promotion of the movie they made about the book. I mean one reference ok, but there was well over 20. That became annoying and took away from my concentration of the explanations. They would just throw it in there, weird. But I can undestand WHY they did it. Still a great book and I would highly suggest reading it."
4,Better than the DVD,"If you are considering The Secret but are skeptical that it will be cheesy than stick to the CD. I found the DVD to be cheesy.This is a really great book, CD, DVD that will help train you to think positive. Very uplifting. Something that you can listen to again and again."
2,Revisionistic,"The central idea expressed in this book is reminiscent of Norman Vincent Peale's ""Power of Postive Thinking."" However, it goes a step further into the surreal area of wishing something so -- a bit far-fetched. You can want something, focus on it, tailor all of your actions towards that end, and perhaps realize your dream, but merely expecting and wishing something into reality and structuring your thinking as if you have already attained your goal is beyond credibility, in my view. An outstanding commercial venture! Hooray for the author! She has gotten what she wants alright, but she did not just wish for it and expect it to happen. She worked for it (researching, etc.), did she not?"
1,Slick promotional book which has no original ideas everyone everyone was taken from motivational writers over 25 years ago.,"Slick promotional book which has no original ideas. I would not even give it a one but there was not a zero on the rate chart. Every phrase, idea, almost word for word was taken from motivational writers books and tapes over 25 years ago. If you want to read the original versions (if you do not have ADD and are under forty) you may want to read Norma Vincent Peel and others in this generation. Even Anthony Robbins first tapes are better than this book or tape. If you want the shot gun approch which does not get to the root issues then get this book. What a waste of money for the consumer. The author is laughing (at you) all the way to the bank!!!!"
2,not inpressed,"While I do believe in the power of positive thinking,this CD was ""too hokey"" for me. I bought the unadbridged version, thinking there would be a few more informational tidbits that would be of interest, but I wasn't prepared for the whole process to be dragged out. The lead-in music and repetition on these disks can be painful. Never once, did I want to sit in my car to finish out a section. I made it thru 3 of the 4 disks and I have to say, I'm listening to the 4th disk just to finish off the series. If there is an abridged version, I go with that, or borrow from your library."
2,"""Secret"" theme in other books",If you are interested in this subject: QUANTUM SUCCESS by Sandra Anne Taylor is the much better book! (Or everything written by Wayne W.Dyer.)
1,Naive Rehash of New Thought,"""The Secret"" is not a secret at all, it is merely an unsophisticated rehash of 19th century New Thought philosophy. Some of the techniques make for good psychology of the ""Positive Thinking"" variety, but the metaphysical claims are so overblown as to be silly.According to ""The Secret"" all the people dying in Iraq (or anywhere else) are drawing that fate to themselves by their own thoughts, since only their own thoughts can have any effect on their lives.There are sophisticated and worthwhile expositions of the ""New Thought"" philosophy, but this isn't one of them."
4,The Secret,I've been vacationing in France and haven't had a chance to read it yet. Give me another month or so.Thank you.Kathryn Miller
1,Everything old is new again,"There was a book written a long time ago that taught that your life is what you create. There was a book written a long time ago that taught that you have the power to create, that you can literally ""speak"" things into existence. It is not a ""new"" notion as people seem to think. There was a book written a long time ago that taught that you can have what you want by your faith in belief, rather than what you see. There was a book written a long time ago that preaches a message of wealth and popularity, of miraculous healings and a fulfilled life. People of this age with all their ""education"" have belittled this notion and this book and have called it antiquated and ridiculous, a crutch of modern man.Perhaps each of you should read it first.It's called the the Holy Bible."
1,Get Behind Me Satan,"Anyone called to walk with God will walk away from all this stuff because they've heeded His word and have been forewarned. They know the simple truth, all comes from Our Father. He's the ""secret""."
1,E for....,Only because you cannot give a rating of zero is why the one star.BLAH and boring.The book was refered by someone who just read it and needed the inspiration.And pretty young.NEXT!!!
3,"If I am a rabbit and think positively, does that mean lions won't eat me? Still, thanks for the positive message in the book.","If I am a rabbit and think positively, does that mean lions won't eat me? Still, thanks for the positive message in the book.Can someone share the view on an answer to the question above?I feel that it is good to be positive, but positive won't solve everything in life. There are other elements."
5,the secret,This book needs to be in everyone's book collection. Ironically the secret is not so much a secret in the literal sense of the word. It implys that it is a secret to us because our society has long forgotten the true meaning of life. Or the true notion of manefastation.Love from Both Sides: A True Story of Soul Survival and Sacred Sexuality
5,A GREAT LITTLE BOOK,I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN. IT WAS A VERY FAST READ AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND AS WELL. I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH AND WILL REREAD THIS BOOK AGAIN FOR REINFORSTMENT AND THE HAPPYNESS IT BROUGHT ME.
1,very troubling,"Are we that stupid as a nation to believe this cobbled together sunshine and doom kind of book? Well, apparently we are."
3,Interesting concept but not enough proof or practical info for me,"The book was easy to read, and overall, worth reading. The concept is very interesting and I believe, could certainly change your life.I was distracted ocassionally by the drawings that appeared before each contributor's entries. It slowed down the pace of the book.While I liked the concept, I would have preferred more proof, especially since they claim that for thousands of years people have known and lived the secret, yet we only hear from a handful of them. No cites, no context, just 'trust us, people have been using it.' In addition, I was CRAVING some practical exercises that I could use to really implement this concept and make it a daily part of my life. I was really wishing for some more examples.In any event, it's a good, easy interesting read. Great for the beach or a chapter or two before bed. Overall, I would recommend it."
3,so...........,"I was disappointed, seemed like a promo to buy the movie.......so far, and I'm still reading and re reading.......I haven't found the secret...doesn't say how to get started...."
3,just for fun.....,"I enjoyed the book ,for its inspiration, and its feel good la.. la.. land mentality it gives the reader. Its a fun read as long as you don't take it so seriously."
1,Disheartening,"I was disappointed that a book of this nature would refer to ""postitive thinking"" and getting what you want out of like would boast that a 4.5 million dollar mansion as a positive accomplishment in life. How materialistic! Not only that but it was unrealistic and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
2,pollyanna's secret,"I looked forward with anticipation to ""The Secret."" The cover art work is clever, and eye-catching. It is a carefully crafted work designed to create a sense that great wisdom of the ages is about to be imparted. But I think that reviewer C.P. may have been the most articulate in his ""the emperor has no clothes"" review when he said that the only secret here was all the money Rhonda Byrne was taking to the bank. I hate to violate the ""Thumper Rule(when you don't have nothing nice to say, don't say nothing at all.),"" but this book's message could have been written on one page. A far better book is Dawson Church's ""The Genie in your Genes"" which actually explains the scientific basis of a positive attitude and how to harness it to your life. I think there is great value in a positve approach to anything one does in life. But I won't violate the Thumper Rule anymore in an analysis of this book because that would be negative.Pierce Scranton M.D.author, Death on the Learning Curve"
3,Great advertising but the product sure lacks...,"This book was touted by Oprah, I hear. My sister called to tell me about it. I rushed and ordered it from Amazon. I read through alot of it and while there is some good stuff in there, I think you would have to be a complete moron to not have discovered alot of the philosophy behind the book. I think it is worthy as food for thought and maybe some people haven't discovered these things already for themselves, but it really is not anything life-changing for me anyway. Some of it was pretty hokey, as well. Glad I didn't pay the 24 or so bucks they want for it on their website!"
3,This book left me wanting to know more...and now I do!,"I was intrigued by the book and the movie, but found myself wanting to know more about how to really apply this in my life. I think the movie in particular did a great job at bringing this information to the masses in an especially unique way- but it kind of left me hanging as to what to do next.I finally found the answer to that question in Jack Canfield's new book on the Law of Attraction-Jack Canfield's Key to Living the Law of Attraction: A Simple Guide to Creating the Life of Your Dreamsit picks up where the Secret left off and shows me how to really apply this principle in all areas of my life. Ultimately, I suggest Jacks LOA book as a primer and a companion to the Secret dvd so that you have the information and the action steps for really living this way!"
3,Good Stuff for Life but sometimes you wonder...,"Regardless if you buy into the entire approach, there are some common themes of life that are found in books such as The Celestine Prophecy. The Secret puts a twist. Regardless, it's a refreshing approaching and easy read to communicate how changing one's perspective and outlook toward the positive end of the spectrum will diminish the negative energy and results. The secret is how to get the world to use the secret to get the right politicians in office and oust the rest."
2,did not help me...,"when you read a slef help book the one thing you should think is wow this book is really helping me! right? well the Secret did not really help me. they put it in ways that some people would think are stupid. i thought personally the way they put everything and explained everything was stupid. the setrect is just all in your thoughts. what you think in your head is what you bring out to people and the world. so you will get what ever you think. like if you think ""this guy is going to bother me..."" then he will. there now you know."
1,The Secret,It was hard to follow. Not what I expected. I returned it. I don't have the patience to try and figure out how to read a book. I need a book that doesn't make me think so much. Haha
1,Bull,"This is a bunch of bull. Yes if you think positively you will be more apt to ""act"" positively thus ""attracting"" what ever it is you want in life. According to this video you dont have to do anything but sit on your butt and think happy thoughts and eventually that new house or car you always wanted will be given. The example they showed with the kid and the bike is ridiculous. Unless you are a kid sitting around waiting for something to magically appear aint gonna happen. And even in that case it didnt magically appear someone had to take some action (mom/dad went to work in order to afford the bike). This is nothing but an infomercial that rips you off before you get to hear the ""secret"", if you actually paid for this crap."
1,Oh - PUH-lease!,"Anyone STUPID enough to PAY for this book (which promises a great life if you just, basically: ""think positive thoughts"")-- YOU'RE the sucker.The author is laughing all the way to the bank."
5,"Exaggerated, but Profound","I absolutely loved this book. It contains alot that edmost of us have already been taught through our religions, but with a new twist that shows how much power each of us really has. It may be exaggerated, but it helps to get the point across."
2,Purchased for my sister and she hated it,"I purchased this for my sister for her birthday, based on a recommendation from a mutual friend. My sister lost a son in Iraq in 2005. She says she appreciates the thought behind my purchase, but thinks that saying out loud ""I want my son alive again"" over and over is not too realistic and that she doesn't believe in this kind of stuff. I am disappointed that she didn't like it and that I didn't research the book before purchasing it. :("
1,garbage,"I guess good promotion makes a book popular because this book is horrible. I can't believe people actually liked it. Save your money. Get this book instead.Think and Grow Rich, Original 1937 Classic Edition"
3,Good methods for encouraging more productive thinking,"When a good friend of mine with a company known as Wealth Masters International handed me this CD we both were under the impression it was a video DVD.I learned it was an audio CD just prior to my recent journey to the Free State (New Hampshire). The audio book was actually more appropriate for my understanding, and I listened to it during my drive.One would classify The Secret as motivational outreach. It is authored by Rhonda Byrne, an Australian television and film producer who was inspired to develop her ideas and publish them by a nearly 100-year-old book The Science of Getting Rich by Wallace D. Wattles. The Secret has become somewhat of an icon in the network marketing business.Recall I reviewed Napoleon Hill's book Think and Grow Rich toward the end of last year...For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2007"
3,Appears to be a rehash of the DVD,"Disclaimer: I don't own this book. I own the DVD and I love it. The information and experience I get from watching the video are invaluable and are already making an impact on my life.That being said, last night I went into Barnes and Noble to see this book on one of the front display cases, and I picked it up to thumb through it to see what was different about the book from the DVD. I didn't find anything. The book contained verbatim quotes from the ""teachers"" in the film. Which isn't bad, it just didn't add anything.If you prefer reading, get the book. If you prefer watching it and seeing visual representations of what they're demonstrating, get the DVD. If you want something to listen to in the car or on the subway, get the audiobook. Just your personal preference."
5,A lot of truth that makes a lot of sense,Great book to read and to follow through in life. Simple rules that really do work. Be good and be positive ...
2,Manifesting?,Did not enjoy the audio servies. I much preferred Esther Hicks' version of The Secret. Probably the DVD would have been much better.
5,"For some, this is not second nature","Yes, alot of you say this is nothing new, but for some of us, we just weren't brought up with positive thinking. I have seen the DVD, and now own the CD set. I highly recommend both! This information should be taught in grade school. Since I started listening to The Secret, I feel reborn. Like I am getting a second chance on life! I am very excited about today and what the future holds! May God and the Universe Bless Rhonda Byrne and all those that helped bring The Secret to us!"
4,It is all that it is cracked up to be,"After watching the CNN program and boththte Oprah programs, this CD collection confirmed all that I had hoped. What's better than driving in the car, listeing to a CD and feeling wonderful, confident in ones future and hopeful.For those of you who are busy or perfer to hear your books, this is the thing for you. GReat!!!"
5,The Secret CD,The Secret DVD rocked but the CD rocked even more. There are two more hours of content and it really explains more clearly the law of attraction. The author does a fantastic job of narrating. I highly recomend this version of The Secret.
1,The Secret is no Secret if you read the Bible,"All references are from the New King James Version. Please check for yourself in any version. There's a lot more great stuff in there! Seek and you shall find...Blessings! ElizabethLuke 6:38 Give and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be put into your bosom. For with the same measure that you use, it will be measured back to you.Matthew 5:7 Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy.James 3:16 For where envy and self seeking exist confusion and every evil thing are there.2 Corinthians 9:6 But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully."
1,Blah!,"I thought I would learn a lot from this book so many people raved about it, but I thought it was way too repetative. Very disappointing."
2,"What is ""The Secret""? This book doesn't really tell you....","You can't tell from this book that there IS ""a secret"". A better alternative to ""The Secret"" is ""The Law of Attraction: The Basics of the Teachings of Abraham"" by Esther and Jerry Hicks. Their examples are much more clear and relevant. Also, ""The Power of Intention"" by Dr. Wayne Dyer is a more practical implementation of the concepts talked about in ""The Secret"".Don't waste your money and time on ""The Secret"" (unless you can borrow it from someone else) when there are so many other more valuable books on"
2,The Secret,"I thought this book was going to give me more insight. However, it already told me what I already knew."
5,The Secret,I bought this as a gift for my Granddaughter. She loved it.She said its was very inspirational. thank you
4,Basic validity under the hyperbole.,"The basic concept behind this presentation is strong, valid and powerful. The problem I have with the presentation itself is that it is very misleading in phraseology. Much more emphasis is needed on the paying attention to what shows up after the intention is put out there and responding in a proactive and energetic and appropriate manner. It is too easy to listen and get the impression that once the intention is expressed your job is done; just sit back and wait for it to be ""manifested"". With full awareness of the responsibility to act which follows the intention, this is a very meaningful and enriching belief system."
2,the secret,I originally saw the film version of The Secret on netflix. I thought the book would be an in depth analysis of the program. I found it very simplisticly written and an actual carbon copy of the film. The subject matter was very repetitive. I expected a lot more. Sorry.
5,The Secret,"An awesome book, I would recommend getting it in CD format to put on your iPod for every day listening. It is a simple concept,however being positive all the time is a bit exhausting but it is an everyday challenge and a good goal to have in a person's life....It is so easy to go through your daily life and forget the importance of something so simple...it is a must read and it is definitely something worth having on your iPod or on a CD for your drive into work or out running errands..."
5,The Secret - fantastic,"I read the book and noticed that the book had many different people who gave their comments.I was worried that in the audio program would not differentiate the different authors. However, this audio was FANTASTIC.I not only could tell who the author was but the other authors recorded their comments in their own voice.I highly recommend this audio book.It's easy to follow.Easy to understandand it tells us how to live the life that we want."
4,Makes it all sound so easy,"Well, I've been doing spiritual practice with Hermetic Kabbalah for about two years now. To have this book come along and try to tell us all that a magical lifestyle is easy is a bit of a kick in the head. But, hec, maybe it's true for a lot of folks, for those who are already further along down the path. The author of 'The Secret' has a knack for selling spirituality. Gotta give her credit for that much. And she certainly turns you on to what is possible - at least for what is possible for you when you get the psycho-baggage sorted out.For those who are still trying to get to the point where this book is a reality, I recommend in-depth texts like 'Vajra World' and 'Kabbalah, Magic & the Great Work...' Once the prelimary work of these kinds of books is carried out to completion, I imagine that the reality painted by 'The Secret' will transform from New Age dream world to, well, at least a probability."
5,The Secret!!!!,"The Secret unclogged my sink, aligned the steering in my Tercel and made me a dynamo in the sack, all because I imagined those things to happen! Wait, did I just give away the Secret?"
1,Don't Be Duped,"This book reminds me of Louise Haye, who duped AIDS patients into believing they could think good thoughts and survive AIDS. She had people ""thanking the virus, thanking your toilet "". It didn't work and many died.Also, if you're an atheist like me, you'll find this book difficult to read.My opinion = We can't change everything with our thoughts. Look how many prayer vigils and memorials are made for missing children, only to find the poor child is dead. What happened to the good thoughts & energy?In my opinion we all know, by intuition, what we need to be happy.Give the cash for this book to a homeless person - you'll both be happier."
1,I don't like this,Too close to those prosperity Gospel people I've been seeing on TV. What is wrong with accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior and allowing God to provide? He has a plan for you. Visualizing isn't going to help you when the Big Day comes!!!!
4,Review,"An awesome review and reminder of how I'm living my life... as God is my Universe: Ask and you shall receive. A true positive uplift in thinking, speaking and well-being."
1,Nonsense,"I can visualise about being married to Rachel Hunter and inheriting Gate's empire, but it ain't gonna happen."
2,Overhyped Infomercial,"I couldn't get past reading 3-4 pages at a time before struggling to control the gag reflex. This book contains some good material but the testimonials (that get more and more ridiculous and outrageous as the book progresses) make it read more like a hard sell infomercial. Sorry, but the power of positive thinking only goes so far - to state that a person can eat all they want and as long as they practice proper thinking they won't gain weight is absolute hogwash. Take out all the outrageous testimonials and this book is about 25-30 pages long, and at 25-30 pages of solid suggestions that positive thinking generates positive energy, it would not have been nearly as nauseating."
3,fundamental,"This, what is preaches, is everything we all know and grew up learning, but forgot. Thanks for reminding us..... but don't pay for it. Borrow it from a library or friend. You're better off seeing the video and/or sharing the idea with friend(s). Author's wish was to make money....no?"
1,The Secret,I found the book to be self serving and superfulious. It really is a boring read. Most of what is said could be contained on 2 pages.
5,The Mind Is A Very Powerful Thing!,"I have read many other books along this line & am so happy to see these ideas encompassed in one book! The mind is a very powerful thing as has been proven many, many times in many, many different ways so why can't anyone be a success the way The Secret explains? The author, Rhonda Byrne, found Scientific, Biblical, people from hundreds of years ago who believe and KNOW the mind is powerful, as well as modern day people and has done a wonderful job of putting it together in an easy and understandable format! Prayer, knowing, believing and practicing go hand in hand in reading, watching and/or listening to The Secret! The law of attraction has always been around! Thank You One & All!!!"
5,It has actually changed things .....,I got this one from the library and read it ...then wife read itThen a few more people noddedI bought it -- coz my wife tells me it has changed the way she approaches issues now -- gets less sad ---which is very good for me :)
4,very interesting,"Too soon to really say(I'm currently reading other books as well), but I would say that I'm enjoying it and that it's very intriguing. Thanks"
2,More Hype Than New Knowledge,"I was disappointed in this book's rehash of Norman Vincent Peale's insights and ideas. Some thoughts quoted from outstanding presenters of the ""Power Of Positive Thinking"" or the ""attraction theory"" were good refreshers of that old theme."
4,The Secret isn't a secret any more,The subject was presented in a great format. Easy to read and understand. It was easy to see that God was involved in the subject from begining to end.
5,How To Be A Creative Genius,"I bought the THE SECRET DVD and have watched it five times with friends and family. Everyone, and I mean everyone, who watched it was inspired by the message... the Universe/Spirit/Being/Goddess/God is waiting for you to clearly ask for what you want. ""Your wish is my command."" Focus on what you want. Feel the joy of receiving it KNOWING your wish is on the way. How can any reader/viewer not see the creative genius in this?When my sister gave me THE SECRET book for the holidays I initially thought it was a kind-but redundant-gift. However, I often open the book to a page and read a message that is exactly what I need to remember. I HIGHLY recommend getting the book & DVD because the principles provide a roadmap for success. I don't have the audiobook yet but will get it since I want to continually feed my brain healthy, creative concepts.Caryn ColganAuthor of Ancient Pact, Volume 1: The Element of Air"
3,"Shhhhh, it's a secret",This book is more a grouping of similar ideas than a book. A lot of what is mentioned is quite redundant. All-in-all not a bad book for motivation and inspiring self-esteem and awareness.
3,the bottom line is important,"The message of the secret: Attracting and manifesting what you want out of life by positive thinking is important and good. The DVD I found to be cheesy. There is something about this whole thing that makes you feel a bit like you are being sold something or into some kind of culty world. The problem I have with this type of thinking is that you really have no room ever for a negative thought about anything which may not be reasonable. Sometimes some thing may just be bad and you need to change it. Again, if this is the first time you have ever encountered this type of thinking than give it a good listen and you will grow a lot. For others that have been living this way you may be a bit turned off by the presentation of The Secret."
3,Not enough focus in the audio CD version,"The Law of Attraction is real and is working in powerful and positive ways in my life. I purchased the audio CD version of the book and found it tedious and tiresome. The sound bytes switch from speaker to speaker with so much speed that none of them are able to amplify what they are saying. Perhaps the book is better. However, the concepts taught in The Secret have worked for me, and have proven true for me. I feel energized and focused when I listen to it on my way to work in the car."
3,LIKE ANYTHING ELSE...,"You (the listener or reader) take from the author what you need and disregard anything else that is written or spoken that you don't need. The quality of the audio is crystal clear on any outsource. i.e. cd, dvd, mp3 players.That's my review about this audio cd."
4,Repetitive,"Positive,very possibly life changing suggestions.And who are those people?A pamphlet or magazine article would've sufficed."
3,Would rather just watch the movie,"This book is great, don't get me wrong...I just think the DVD is better!Only purchase this book if you have NO plans of watching the movie."
4,Positive message,I found this book to be very positive and gave me an alternative way to view current situations I'm facing. I kept an open mind while reading this book and took away what was relevant for me.
3,Strongly presented without evidence.,"I thought the book was written in an entertaining manner without logic or experience facts. i was induced to believe something like this when I was young and very insecure. It gave me the confidence I needed to lead a successful life, though there were points in my career when I might have been better off without the unfounded confidence that led me to go out on a limb.."
3,"Useful advice, if repetitous","The highly touted book ,the Secret, provides some useful insight into the most ancient view of life and the concepts of paradise in the human experience. The author uses plain English and makes points with examples. For those with an IQ higher than room temperature, the incessant repetition is frustrating.Nevertheless, if you're fed up with the vestiges of organized religion of the middle ages still being perpetrated on humans of the 21st century, this book is refreshing and worthwhile."
2,Great Book for starters,"This book is good for starters but personally, after studying the Teachings of Abraham done by Esther Hicks, I believe they provide a more practical way to living an abundant life."
3,What is the Secret? ;-),Very interesting book. Good thoughts - you will enjoy this one. Just use your head when reading. Kind of runs along the line of Way of the Peaceful Warrior.
2,The Secret is Incomplete,"There is more to the Law of attraction and creating your own reality, than is covered in this book. In truth, the laws of mind were only taught to disciples in a mystery school, after many years of purification. You see, it is possible to misuse the power of mind and get totally enmeshed in the acquisition of material things. That's why spiritual development is necessary before getting involved with these laws.To really understand Humanity's next step beyond the teaching of The Secret, I highly recommend THE POWERS OF THOUGHT, by OMRAAM MIKHAEL AIVANHOV"
2,Where is the Secret?????????,"Ok, I'm a writer, I've got two and a half Master's Degrees and I read all the time, so on vacation down in Malibu I bought this book because of all the hype and began reading. To my surprise (and disappointment) I found that all it is is a bunch of other people's quotes gathered together for inspiration. I worked in advertising in New York City and I learned you can't just promise something, your product has to deliver. THERE IS NO DAMN SECRET in this book, just the basic premise that if you put good energy out, good energy will come your way. Wow...astounding...Shame on you Rhonda Byrne for thinking the general public is really that stupid. A good MAC lipgloss would do me more good than this book and it would have cost me less! I gave my copy to a homeless guy. Maybe Rhonda can help him find his dream home!"
2,almost there but no bannana,The interesting thing about the Secret is the secret is does not disclose. That is how the author so cleverly tricked thousands upon thousands of people into believing she had some ancient remedy for our social ills. She doesn't but she sure did have a solution to her overdraft and for that she deserves fantastic credit!! well done you.See other reviews of mine for this era of books in self-help so you don't go wasting your hard earned.
2,Disjointed,"The Secret was highly recommended to me by a medical professional. My comment to her was the only thing it helped was my insomnia. It contains many very pertinent comments but it is so disjointed that I felt I was reading Bartlett's Book of Quotations; I was not at all comfortable with this book nor did I feel it met the needs it was ""prescribed"" to meet."
2,A few diamonds in the rough,"There are a few useful exercises for re-orienting one's mode of thought to useful ends. Otherwise mostly drivel in the format of a late night infomercial. 93% fluff, 100% corny."
2,Flawed message about negative and positive thinking,"The message of this book is ""Just be positive and it will all turn out fine"". When you have little to lose or bogged down with negative thinking, this message can be motivating. But when you can suffer substantial losses by ignoring negativity, this philosophy is dangerous and can even be catastrophic. Most sane people back up their computers!I recommend two top-notch books for the genuine seeker. The first bookOptimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self, shows you how to maximize your thinking, best deal with negativity, and create your best life and career. The other book isLearned Optimism: How to Change Your Mind and Your Lifecontrasts optimism and pessimism. Both of these books are invaluable, and will empower you to soar above unrealistic optimism."
1,The Secret,This book is attractively packaged. However 'the secret' is what we have always known as humans. Every thing comes to those who work for it truly and honestly. A very clever marketing campaign has made a lot of money for the author and that is about all.
3,This is not a Secret? old repeated information !!!,"What is so secret about this? I started reading about the law of attraction two years ago, would go to the reccommended reading in the back and then go buy those books. THis information has been out for way over 100 years. the best ones to me are Abraham HIcks, Sanaya Roman, and Jane Roberts. Of course all those are ""channeled"" books, but who cares, the information is even better than in the Secret. All the secret is is a repeat of old news.What I liked about it is that it does sum up many books in one and is a great introduction to the law of attraction.To those who likened it to the occult, well yes it is similiar to magick almost. Just one way to take charge of your own life and accept responsibility for your own life. Whats wrong with that?DC"
1,Bad choice,"A friend of mine started reading it and thought I might like it. There is nothing new in the book, I've done most of it all just by common sense since I was a senior in high school (I'm 64 now). Content was a total waste of time - good thing I purchased the CD so I could listen to it and not waste even more time reading it. Now for those of you that have no common sense, it might be worth your time."
3,The pretence of old parchment doesn't make the contents better.,I was delighted to see the book at last and was very interested in being re-introduced to the law of attraction. It did answer the old conundrum as to why only some people profitted and others did not. However it could have said all that in a small tract. The repetition became boring.
2,Not what I expected,I thought it was going to be a story but instead it was more of peoples opinions. Not at all what i expected
1,problem with your delivery,"The book the secret never came to my address (16407 sapphire place, weston florida, 33331). Very good that you write me this message, to comunicate that i never receive my book the secret. Also i bought with your web in july (2012) a movie ""terminal"" with tom hank and your personal made a mistake and send me another movie (harry crumb with john candy). In august i wrote you about this and your costumer service never responde me.Please send me mu book the secret and my movie Terminal.Thanks,Luis Mata"
1,Cult of Selfishness,"I saw the DVD version first, and then read the book. To an educated reader, its premises could sound unbelievably simplistic. Optimism is one thing, but this entire book as an ode to human selfishness and greed. Your women got raped during war, well, you didn't have the right mind set, Blackwater made millions through wars, well, Erik Prince had the ""right"" mindset. What a load of rubbish. For those professing religious beliefs in Christianity, Islam, or Hinduism, you might find the book also problematic on moral grounds, as it never does account for events in everyone's lives, where other people's actions have directly impacted yours. It basically blames the victims. Going through Jim Crow and lynching, well, change your mindset and the oppressor class will automatically calibrate their behaviour towards you. Donate the money to a soup kitchen instead of buying this book (oh wait, the homeless actually want to be homeless according to this book!)"
4,The Secret that Is Not,"What a delightful reminder ( from many pov's)that abundance does not mean the same to everyone: Asking for abundance is not ""taking it away"" from someone else.I enjoyed the many ways, the same message is presented here. By the end one comes away with the awareness that we are indeed living in diversity on One planet and we really can .."" All Have Enough"" of whatever is needed or wanted. The non secret is now ""out"": By setting our intention and holding it in a positive on going mind-set manifestation occurs i.e. Vision the end before the beginning then have the courage to follow the road to your dreams.Katherine Rosengren"
1,There's no Secret here,"As I read The Secret, I couldn't believe that the professional who recommended it to me embraces the nonsense this book spews out. Turns out, she doesn't - I ordered the wrong book. I read the first four or five chapters, and was stunned that anyone could seriously entertain most of what the authors wrote. They do touch on some long-held beliefs shared by people throughout the ages, but they have an ability to turn such nuggets of truth into a life view that embraces the pursuit of wealth and fame. And you can have it, too - just follow the law of attraction! After reading the biographies of the various contributors, it is obvious that the book is a painfully thin-veiled advertisement for the workshops, books, and programs they are hawking. I'm very surprised well-known, otherwise fairly wise people didn't see that coming from the start."
1,A little skeptical...,Well I began to read it. I applied all the ideas around the Law of Attraction with no success. Although I have not had any luck what so and I am back to old miseries.-I had a terrible review last week.-I had a returned check yesterday because my direct deposit at work had an error.-I just found out that I will need to quit my job do to a ride issue. I have a mountain of debt.I have written down a list of the possibilities surrounding these negatives. Perhaps it will help. But for now I'm just so depressed and I dont know what to do.Maureen
5,"This Book Can Change your Life, Great Book, Great Deal!",I found this hardback book here with a great deal.It's a great book with a great price and I found with buying the DVD too I saved on my shipping too! I highly recommend both this book and DVD to buy it here enjoy!
1,A New Take on the Pursuit of Happiness,"Hello all,My name is Caroline; I'm with a media production company in Baltimore. I think folks who are interested in The Secret's core concepts, but feel that the book falls short will be interested in our project.The Euphoria Stream is a video blog made by Lee Boot, who asks the question: In a country built for the pursuit of happiness, is it working? Are you happy? It's an ""art-documentary"" about what makes you (personally) happy. Positive thinking lies at the core of the films, however we believe that the concept is complex and action-based, and need not be limited to personal gain. Backing up theories with neuroscience and biological knowledge doesn't hurt either! The Euphoria Stream is a new sort of media, and we hope it's thought provoking and meaningful. Anyway, if you have a minute, check out The Euphoria Stream (and if you are feeling so inspired, it would be great if you would leave a comment on the site telling us what you think!)[...]Thanks!Caroline"
4,Gets people thinking...,"With all the hype of this book and all the TV shows and radio shows the authors have been on, and then of course to get on Oprah, it's almost guaranteed to sell millions! There is alot of interesting information in the book and it certainly is worth thinking about. Wheather it changes your life or not I don't think is the point, it's more about being open to another way of thinking, which for some will cause better results in their lives. My hat goes off to anyone who tries to bring something positive to the world. I think it's great that this book has done and is still doing so well. Wheather it's all true or not, it is putting out positive information that is bound to help alot of people feel better about themselves."
3,LIVE LIKE A FRUIT FLY!,"I get it. Law of attraction. Got it.If you want to really get a bang for you buck, check out the book Live Like A Fruit Fly.No secret there."
3,Great book-Makes me try harder to be a good person.,"I love this book. Trying to live by the teachings is really hard.Havent reach my goal, yet. Read the book over and over.."
4,"The Old, Old Story told In A Fresh New Way","In the light of negative daily news, we are blessed by Rhona Byrne's book. Each page reminds us that, indeed, Love and Truth are more powerful than evil. The book shows us that the time tested truths of the ages have always been available to ""seekers"". It is proper instruction as how to use the Law of Attraction to our advantage."
3,Service was great....book was not,I heard a lot about this book - good and bad. I have to say the service was great in having it shipped to me and the price was right but the content of the book is ridiculous. I don't recommend it and I think its a little on the crazy side.
2,The secret isn't so secret,"I read this in 15 minutes in the bookstore, and the book is basically the old witchcraft/magic spiel wrapped in a trendy cover. The law of attraction? This is exactly the same as the 'if you want for it hard enough, it'll come, magic crap you can find anywhere on the internet. The most annoying thing about this version of it, is that the author brings up all these famously successful people and geniuses and claims that they followed the rules she lays down in the book. Whatever, Rhonda."
2,Too materialistic of an approach,A little bit too focused on the material aspect of the Law of Attraction for my taste. I hope that most people picking up a book like this are looking to attract more than a new car and a good parking space. It would be a good introduction to the concept of the Law of Attraction for people without any previous exposure.
1,Not at all impressed!,"I had heard much about this book, but after reading it, I feel I just wasted my money. I have read other books that had much more interesting language and ideas- this one was hard to read, hard to understand and most of all, not worth my time, money or trouble."
1,The Secret,"Read it and placed it aside. Listen, if you want anything worthwhile in life you have to be persistent and go out and work for it. God helps those who help themselves. I read another book titled The Key to the Secret by James De Havilland and believe me it is great. De Havilland teaches that unused capability becomes the lost capability therefore you must unfold your own capability. He doesn't tell you to simply believe, he tells you to ""do"". That's my opinion."
3,Power of imagination,I am still reading it; I am finding it different and very interesting; anyone who is looking to delve in new experienceces must read this book..
1,"""The Secret"" Is No Secret","""The Secret"" is not really a secret at all. This book's premise has been written about (although not in ""The DaVinci Code"" genre) in countless self-help books over the years - the most popular and enduring being Dr. Norman Vincent Peale's ""The Power of Positive Thinking."" ""The secret"" is repeated ad nauseum through quotes from various New Age gurus for 184 mind-numbing pages. The numerous celebrity talk-show endorsements only makes ""The Secret"" and its ""Oh my gosh!"" DVD a best-selling gold mine for its authors. It reveals nothing new."
1,"Bad Concept, Bad Book","Don't be fooled by this horrible concept and horrible book. The Law of Attraction is perhaps one of the stupidest ideas I have ever heard of. I wonder if she has ever played with magnets....But anyway, good things do not happen because you wish good things would happen. It just doesn't work that way."
1,This Series is Trash,"This book, the DVD and the whole principle behind it is junk, and the authors are the only ones getting rich."
4,Interesting Book,This is an interesting book that appeals to everyone who is looking for the balance in life. I have told many people about it.
5,Amazing book,"Really enjoyed this book. More for what the spiritual side can bring not so much the material objects. Positive thinking is always best, sometimes difficult in this day and age but possible and so worth it. I really believe in the books message and have bought it for several friends and family members."
5,good advice,It takes just as much energy to think negatively as it does positively. I enjoy reading the book because it helps keep me in the right mindset.
1,So what?,"What about God and Karma? We have certain karma that preempts all that we wish coming to pass. Illness may be transcended and maybe not. We may be born into a hard life and maybe not. Life is not about what it is that only we want, but how we can help others, also. Setting up the conditions for what we desire in this life is all that we can do. The truest way to look at life is to be the best individual you can be and leave the rest to Divinity."
1,"Reader, beware.","This book can be very damaging to people who have experienced a horrible event in their lives. The words were physically painful to me and I threw the book in the garbage can as quickly as I could.Positive thinking, obviously is good for us in many ways. But to suggest that negative thinking causes the bad things that happen to us is tricky and destructive business. Consider the innocent,positive adults and children that suffer and die in accidents, natural disasters, terrorist attacks.....This book is harmful and damaging.....don't buy it unless nothing bad has ever happened in your life."
2,A rip off of the Bible,"This book could be somewhat of an inspiration, but most of the concepts within I've already read in the Bible. (Ask, Believe, Receive). It just supplants ""God"" with the ""Universe"". The book has nothing groundbreaking in it-it's mostly about positive thinking and manifesting things with thought. I'd simply recommend being more positive and expecting good things in life."
3,The Secret Loses Its Secrecy,"The Secret by Rhonda Byrne explains a philosophy for living one's desired life. She explores the concept of attracting what one wants to one's life through thought, attitude, and expression. She discusses how to adopt the philosophy into one's life and to create the specific things one wants in life. The chapters explain the concepts and provide examples by people who live by the philosophy of The Secret. Each chapter ends with a summary of the chapter's concepts incorporating the actions the reader should take. At times, the reader will think the concepts are so simple they should've thought of them long before. Some claims included make perfect sense. Others will leave the reader with questions. The Secret explains its concepts in easy to understand language and will provide the reader with insight into his/her own thought process at the very least."
3,"Good, but sth missing - found elsewhere","Good, but sth missing - found elsewhereThere is some really inspiring stuff in this book. If you're new to the subject, like me you can be partly amazed and partly suspicious. I'm not sure it does a good job of backing up the theories it presents. I'm a skeptic so I need some more convincing and I did get much more evidence that this stuff works and how to make it work in ""Read Me I Am Magical"". Plus the hidden message in this one can really blow your mind."
5,Living right,"Loved this book, all about a positive thought process & doing the right things to make your self successful in every aspect of your life."
5,the secret,"I can't even remember how many copies of this book I have purchased. All my sons,my daughter-in-law and my friends have received a copy from me. This is the book-guide I have waited for for years. I read it often."
4,Personal developement from different perspectives,"If you practice manifesting or want to learn more about it. Thenthis is a really good book to read. I first got this because a clienthanded me the movie. My wife, daughter and I sat down and watched it.It was pretty good. Most of the stuff you may have heard of before ifyou have read a personal development book; but they do give differentoutlooks from different perspectives. That is really the key tothe whole thing. The different perspectives. The core of this book isthat what you think about you can achieve. I found that it does workas long as you add some massive action. All and all it's a great book- but make sure to put it into action or you will just waste yourmoney.Matt BacakAuthor of Secrets of the Internet Millionaire Mindand The Ultimate Lead Generation Plan"
1,I agree with S. Winters Comments including,"S. Winters ""anastasia35"" (Salt Lake City) -. . . By far the most offensive part of the message is the suggestion that people who have pain in their lives are somehow attracting it with their thoughts. Darfur rape victims did not ask for it. Children who are molested did not ask for it. Starving Africans did not ask for it. To suggest that their ""incorrect thinking"" is the cause of this is sickening. Positive thoughts may help you endure pain, and help you find meaning in it, but it will not end random violence, illness and war. Shame on anyone who tells a sick person that they are manifesting it themselves, that they don't want to get well badly enough."
2,Very unsettling,"Just got rid of it..don't bother, one persons opinion and certainly not for everyone"
3,good . . .but not sure what all they hype is about,"At the end of the day, you have to work. I understand the importance of wishing and believing, that makes sense. But this is a world where you have to put effort in to get results."
1,Sucks and all its a lie,Lies this book is all lies you need god in your heart do not read this book it tricks your mine to believe the wrong thing
3,The movie is better,"I recommend downloading and watching the movie, that is the secret. The book is choppy going from interview person to person. Worth reading, but movie is better."
3,"Good message, but a li'l over the top","The basic message that the author is trying to get across makes sense and it comes across pretty strongly - we create our own reality. At a subconscious level, I can see this making sense. In my opinion, this is something we should be aware of and attempt to use this ideology to changes our lives for the better. After all, there's no downside thinking in the way this book advises us to think. There is only upside if our lives can indeed change as a result of our new thought process or approach to our lives.The reason I give it 3 stars is that this book, in addition to making a case for the ""we create our own reality"" theory, it heavily oversells itself. I mean Shakespeare and Aristotle? Really? More than half the book is focused on overselling, way over the top. If the book focused on content, it would have been about half the thickness and I would have gladly rated it a 5. Author should have toned down a bit."
3,The Secret,I enjoyed reading the book but the video is a bit overrated. I don't know whether anyone can have a positive frame of mind always when negative things are happening to you all the time. Time will tell..
5,unbelievable.....,"this book truely changed my life from being a negative person to a positive person.. it helped me find my real me, finding the love of my life and tought me to kiss old friendships and relationships good bye, which where unhealthy for me... Thank you Rhonda Byrne for saving me!"
5,Life changing book?,This book is excellent and reminds us of those things we need to bring positive into our life. I have given copies of this book of many of my friends and have encouraged many more to pick up a copy.
5,The Secret,"My life has completely changed as well as my thinking after studying, and implementing the ancient Secret principles. Every human being should have and apply The Secret.Robert Goldstein"
3,A good philosophy,"Simplistic, unsubstantiated and often times self-contradictory i still think there is value to the overall point of the book and the sugestions that are presented. It is obvious that having a positive mental outlook is beneficial in life and helps people get what they want. Does it really work the way the author and her experts claim it does by actually changing the world to fit personal desires? maybe, but that shouldn't be the point."
5,Life Changing,The contents of this book encourages life changing strategies. It had inspired me to take a look at the world around me and how I fit into that world. How both positive and negative force impacted me and what can I do to change them. Great inspiration book.
2,Not impressed,Very redundant. All that is said in the book can be put onto about 10 pages. It really is not secret.
2,Definitely not worth the hype,"This book says nothing that I haven't read about before. It just repeats the same thing over and over again. I did find some of the comments that James Canfield and others who contributed very interesting, and because of that I may buy a book by them."
3,Self-serving,"This book has many redeeming ideas, but I felt it was too focussed on materialism. I also did not agree that we bring on all sickness and all tragedies by failing to think positive thoughts."
1,A BIG LIE,"This book is more fiction than Harry Potter and Star War combined. If you want to know the Truth it's no SECRET and it's FREE. Joh 14:6 Jesus answered him, ""I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one goes to the Father except through me. Joh 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.Joh 3:36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him."
1,this book is a waste of money,personaly I thought this book was alot of hype. It did not help me at all. I feel stupid for buying it. it felt like it was writen in two weeks. It had no real debth
1,Don't bother,"I've read this book and the only ""secret"" is how to take ideas that have been around for thousands of years and market them under a ""mysterious"" sounding title for lots of money. Go to your library and read about Einstein or Henry Ford, etc. Who they were as people is a lot more fascinating than this book. I just found it to be hackneyed, and a lot of new-age hype. And by the way, I am very successful and have a good life because of HARD WORK and good decisions. No big ""secret"" there."
1,"If a tree falls in a forest and it kills Elizabeth Taylor, does anyone care?",Here's the secret: the author made a lot of dough selling gibberish because the new age mentality can't be bothered with an old age thing like thinking critically. I hear a lot of villages crying to get their idiots back. Not since Elizabeth Taylor claimed to be channeling dead people just to stay in the news has there been such a demonstration of mass gullibility.
2,Secret is no secret,"""The Secret"" by Rhonda Byrne is nothing more than a rehash of previously written books and articles on ""You are what you think"", ""The Law of Attraction"", and ""The Power of Positive Thinking"". And while it's a pretty little book, it's not that well written. The focus seems to be way too much on attaining wealth. The way everyone was talking about it I expected some new methodology to achieve the state necessary to bring positive things into your life. That still remains a secret."
4,"Not a ""New Secret""","As the book says, this idea is not new. I have been practicing ""the Secret"" in life for years. For those that need to be enlighten as to how to make their life better this a one of the many books to read. Also, read Joel Olsteen's ""Your Best Life Now"". Both books reaffirmed that we reap what we sow, be it in actions, thoughts or words."
4,The Secret,I found the information and advice in this CD to be truly inspirational and realistically attainable. It's spoken in easy to understand language with no hidden or confusing messages - just pure honest testimony from people who have used The Secret and have benefitted from it. I highly recommend giving it a try if you are seeking true harmony within yourself in order to achieve your goals.
2,"Reads like a small excerpt from Maxwell Maltz's ""Psycho Cybernetics""","The book is very nicely presented, it's colourful in every page, very Hollywood - and nothing wrong with that. I wish most books were made to look this easy and pleasing to the eye.However, content-wise, I suggest reading Maxwell Maltz's classic ""Psycho Cybernetics"" instead - it's tighter, less whimsical/airy-fairy and provides much more guidance to achievements and positive ""state of mind"".I find it funny that something as well-known as visualisation could be re-packaged as ""The Secret"" - talk about nice packaging and marketing!In short - nice packaging. But content leaves a lot to be desired.Read Maxwell Maltz's ""Psycho-Cybernetic"" instead."
3,Entertaining the secret,"The Secret was a very entertaining book, a little new age for me, however, quite a few good points on getting your life together. Enjoyed listening to the author and others narrate and enjoyed the content even though it seemed to be more power of positive thinking only in a new spin."
3,The Secret Refined,"On Page 55 in The Secret, you will read about the difference between taking inspired action (which feels effortless), versus acting to ""make something happen""(which feels like a struggle). Life is described here as a flowing river, and you can either go with the flow of the Universe . . . or against it. I love this metaphor, but it is not original with The Secret (or the author of this section, Bob Doyle). In 2004 I read an entire book on this very metaphor by Steven Lane Taylor. It's called Row, Row, Row Your Boat: A Guide For Living Life In The Divine Flow. I think it greatly refines the concepts in The Secret, and I recommend it as a follow-up to this book. It is especially helpful if you want to know how ""God"" fits into the picture."
1,Don't believe the hype,"The book reads like a commercial. It advertises a very simple idea that is an actual philosophical truth of sorts, but the author does not approach the subject in an unbiased scientific manner. It lacks depth and at one point I had the feeling those who worked on it developed a feverish pitch that felt cult like in nature."
1,"Simplistic, cheesy, too good to be true, leaps of logic","Simplistic and corny are a good start to describing The Secret. Napolean Hill, Tony Robbins and others have talked about the power of positive imagery without making it in to a magic formula akin to ""just think, you may win the lottery"".imagine, ask and receive? Ok, how about know what you want, positive imagery helps, and work very hard to get the things that you want. Oh wait, its a much easier sale if you tell people they can just imagine it and it will happen.They make leaps of logic using pseudo-science, and take famous quotes completely out of context to make their case.sad that folks are deceived by such"
3,The Secret Review,"From what I have read of the book, and although I have not had a chance to finish the book, the idea does seem a little far fetched. Whatever it is that you want,whether it be the sports car, your dream home, that great job or finding the love of your life you are still going to have to work for it. From my understanding, (and like I said I have not finished reading the book) it has the concept of ""Name it, Claim it"". ""If you picture it, you will have it"" If it were that easy, don't you think we would all be living the grand life? I did apply the concept of ""picture it and you will have it, and what do you know, it didn't work. If God does not have what you want in his plan for you, then it is just not going to happen. I guess, when I finish reading the book, I could make a better assesment of what I understand the book to be saying."
1,The Secret,I thought my head was going to explode!!!! Save some money here is the secret.....Think good thoughts..
1,"Horribly shallow, vapid, and bigotted","This basic credo of the book is ""blame the victim"". This book will only accomplish one thing in society and that is to make people more rude, intolerant, and impolite."
1,"Enough about ""ME"" - why not help the world?","Just think of all the tangible good that could be done in the world with all the millions upon millions of dollars the authors of The Secret are making through the book, the DVD, the CD, the speaking gigs etc. etc. Why, there would be millions up millions of dollars to help build wells in Africa, help those with Aids, find cures for diseases, eliminate homelessnesss....Not to mention, if every person who plunks down $20 -50 for the Secret also got out of the ""me"" syndrome and started to think about others.The Secret is no secret. It appeals to our society who believes happiness is found by getting what we want all the time. Life isn't easy, and some of my greatest life lessons have been learned when I have faced challenges and struggles. I believe the real secret to joy and contentment is to turn our attention off of ourselves once in awhile and use that energy and those resources to love and help others."
2,The Secret,"The book is all over the place and doesn't really give any insight as to HOW to apply ""the secret"" to your everyday life. There are just a lot of quotes from a lot of different people. Nothing as spectacular as I was expecting."
4,The Secret Is Out,"I found this book inspiring. It's certainly not a new concept as anyone with a metaphysical bent would attest to, but it's put in a baby simple format that's easy to understand. It's another feel good, the power of positive thinking, type book. And I believe it goes beyond the DVD information wise. I actually believe what Rhonda Byrnes & company are preaching - have so for years - but,like they say, easier said than done. I find it difficult to quiet my mind,really focus and genuinely believe."
5,The Secret,Not only did I like the the book I bought one for each of my children and had to buy the DVD as well for them .It is very inspiring and up lifting and any thing that is postive and sends you on a postive path is great in my eyes.I feel having the writen words in this book is so inspiring .I would say buy it over and over again for your self and for the ones your love .
2,You have to be kidding!,"While I like the concept of positive thinking, visualizing one's bills in the mailbox as checks to ""attract"" money is a bit over the top. I was mortified when one of the individuals quoted in the book was on the Larry King Show and said little Jessica Lundsford, ""...perhaps subconsciously..."" attracted a child molester through her bedroom window. Huh??!!! Wait until one of these law of attraction types cannot vibrate their cancer or heart disease into remission, and they will see that not EVERYTHING is in one's mind. I suspect they are promoting the extreme to generate interest and attention, as most Americans (including me!) are always looking for the easy, quick fix. Alas! It is not here either!!"
1,Complete and utter rubbish,"Let's see, all I have to do is visualize getting $25,000, and I'll get it? Okay. Oh, and the comment that people ""attract"" the bad things that happen to them is beyond insensitive, but I'm quite certain that the author is long beyond shame at this point. She made money off this garbage, and isn't that what's important?If there was a way for me to rate this as zero stars, I'd do it."
1,THE WORST KIND OF FICTION - TRASH,"After reading this book, I was appalled at the ludicrous premises. If it is true, then there are not enough resources in the universe. Please don't waste money on such trash. If you indeed want to change your life then buy books such as ""first things first"", which give you applicable tools not ""head in the clouds"" ludicrous claims. Just wasted 2 hours reading this...please don't make the same mistake."
1,really?,"threw this in my cart after someone told me about it and raved and raved. that person, it turns out, is a simpleton. i had just met them at the time. more idiotic than scientology. lame-o motivational pap that no one with a brain in their head needs. i turn it spine in on the bookshelf, because i don't want anyone to see that it's there."
1,"so, if i keep thinking the world will end in 2012...",What?? Was this book supposed to be taken literally?? There was a lot of explaining but in the end nothing was explained.
2,Very repetitive,"I was recommended by several people to check out this book, as it has changed their lives. I had to stop reading it because every chapter became so repetitive that it was hard to read. In all honesty, don't waste your time!"
1,"Oh, what a farce","If you need to read anything at all about thinking positively, pick up a Dale Carnegie book. This book is hooey. Cure cancer in 3 months just by thinking?? I'd give that a one in a million chance! Between this daffy author and her crony, Joe Vitale, they are metaphysically transporting themselves to the bank, depositing money that YOU should have contributed to charity...believe me, you would feel better doing that."
1,A slick Infomercial selling the obvious such as air,"A cheesy slick marketing juggernaut trying to sell air to the masses. Oh my God....how insulting. One gigantic infomercial. I kept waiting for the punchline ( Will you please tell me the price?). People would be better off reading classical literature and philosophy written by great men and women, and the great works of all religions. That's where the true secret lies. I can sum this book up in one line, ""Pretend your a Magnet that attracts good things and you will attract good things."" Wow!! How much money do you want to spend for that. Psst....let me tell you a secret.....there is no secret...not in this book!"
1,The secret is...,"... that people are willing to spend big bucks for mindless dribble. I am disgusted that I was one of those people. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE. Awful, awful, awful. Seriously, the ""secret"" is think positive thoughts and good things will come to you. There, I just saved you 24.99 and hours of torture."
1,P.T. Barnum knew the market well,"I am constantly amazed at how many self-appointed gurus are eager to proclaim the latest formulaic ""secret"" for indulging in every imaginable fantasy through magical thinking. Even more amazing is how many people buy into it. The formula is simple. Pander to the latest vogue in so-called ""new age"" thinking and add a sprinkling of traditional wisdom for faux credibility. The Tibetans have a term for it. ""An admixture of gold dust and yak dung.""The late Alan Watts made a humorous comparison between institutional Zen and institutional psychiatry in which he stated that, ""Anyone who goes to a psychiatrist ought to have his head examined, and anyone who goes to a Zen master deserves 30 blows of the stick (kyosaku)."" Perhaps we all get the guru we ask for.""There isn't any special method. Attaching to thoughts, you get carried away in delusion and sidetracking yourself. So give it up. That's all there is to it"" -Zen Master Bankei (1622-1693)"
2,The Secret,"I liked the book better than the movie. The movie was like an informercial and one is waiting for the narrator to announce, ""And for just $49.95, you can have your own...."" The book does give some good quotes, but the concept that one draws to oneself what one thinks about most is not a new concept, certainly not a secret, as is obvious from all the other wise people quoted in this one. I do give respect to the author who was smart enough to take old news and package it smartly into a book called the secret that looks like something out of a centuries old vault and we all buy it."
3,Secret makes you money,"The secret works. if you look it up online, there are already several websites selling gratitude rocks for $9/piece."
2,Oversimplistic but one good thing,"I found the book to be extremely over simplistic and tedious to read. It repeats the basic message in every page. If you want to read better work to grow as a person, read anything written by Mariane Williamson or attend any of the courses offered by landmark education. This book is kinder garden. However, I am happy that sales of this book are is doing well since this book is a good starting point for people who have never done any self-improvement work or reading.I wonder why Oprah did not push Marianne Williamson's work instead since she is one of her friends at XM radio."
1,Item never received,"item was never received, emailed seller with no reponse. Had to contact amazon for a refund"
5,Very DEEPLY touched and impressed!,"I must say that the box came in such aura, that is just unexplainable and different. So I started reading... didn't know what to expect... As this maybe just another self development book that I read.A BIG NO! It is so deep, so intense and I feel so connected to every story and every page, as if every sentence was dedicated to me. The book was talking to me, guiding my heart, feeling and mind. I treasure every second reading it, and now I get copies for my loved ones, with prayers that it will bring lights to what so ever answers they are looking for. PEOPLE, I tried and experience the suggestion suggested, and best part the LIGHT that it brought to my personal life is just UNBELIEVABLE! MIRACLES happened one after another... I'm living a totally NEW light of life now... and INTEND TO KEEP IT THAT WAY! The way how I've always wanted it to be...Thanks Rhonda, see you soon. ^_^"
2,"its an okay book, the author has a good point of view but overall its not very good","Average book, good point of view. Not very interesting, would not recommend it. blah blah blah thats all that goes after the first few chapters"
2,A bit too religious-like for my taste...,"I found the book to be in some cases inspiring, but in some cases it repeats the same mantras all the while being, a least for my taste, a bit too religious-like. The use of many opinion leaders (names that don't say anything to me) did not make the book any more credible. The 2 stars I gave are for the parts I found inspiring."
3,Corny,"The book, the audio, and the DVD are all exactly the same. A little inspirational, but I was disappointed to discover that story isn't of a subject's personal experience. It's a collection of motivational speakers giving you insight on the laws of attraction."
1,The positive thinker,I really enjoyed reading The Secret of how to live your life in a positive manner.
3,Interesting Book,"I saw the video of this book. I read the concept of minds power to create what one want from other authors, but what I find it very positive is mass acceptance of this principle( through this book ) which was known to very few who misused it to control media and people. I found it to be a good remainder. If some body who is lost in the frustrations of the daily life , this is a good start"
4,The Secret,Thanks for your prompt delivery and the book is in great condition. Pleasure doing business with you.
3,Essential reading for people without a clue.,"""The Secret"" is fine for anyone who never read anything about this subject, or had a training or anything at all. It is basic. But didn't teach me anything new."
1,SOS Notes review of The Secret,The Secret is a pre-k replica of The Power of Your Subconscious Mind by John Murphy. Murphy's book provides clear instructions on how to tap your subconscious to bring about positive change. The Secret is a comic book filled with excerpts from John Murphy's version and does it no justice.
1,Totally disappointed,The cover of the book was torn seriously.I couldn't believe how the Amazon dealt with the item so poorly.I'm so disappointed at your service.
5,The Secret,This book could help anyone who wants to better their life with positive thinking and a positive attitude. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
4,THE SECRET,"OK, so I do believe that The Secret exists. I had little things take place but I'm still waiting for the major things. There were signs but again still waiting. I'm confident though. I would recommend this book because it does help you to think differently about yourself and your outlook. I think it works. Again, still waiting for the major stuff I asked for and believe in."
2,The Secret Behind the Secret,"The Secret gives readers the power of what CAN be created when you can focus your intentions in solely a positive manner; however, it fails to address the underlying, subconscious thoughts and feelings that we all create with every day. Once you understand how powerful each of us really are, you must understand how we create incredibly powerfully from both our shadow thoughts/feelings AND our positive, enlightened, loving thoughts and feelings. I found that SHIFT:12 Keys to Shift Your LifeSHIFT: 12 Keys to Shift Your Lifewas powerful in assisting me to transform my shadow thoughts and negative feelings of anger, guilt, fear, shame and unworthiness so that I COULD actually create my life anew as they talk about in the Secret! These two books together are AMAZING and I would highly recommend the combination in everyone's library!"
2,More like an advertisement,"Did not like this one very much, too much like devil worship, [as in wanting things] did not like."
5,Would recommend,"Recently I heard on my morning talk show them discussing the Secret in a way to say it was for guiliable people. But they were missing the point of the book helping you to focus on thinking & feeling positive. It's not the point on ""wishing"" for things, but for you to focus on getting them for yourself."
3,THE SECRET,"The graphic work is second to none. I have read extensively in the new thought arena (Christian Larson, Thomas Troward, Ernest Holmes and more) Why is there not a word about Ernest Holmes who influenced the first half of the 20th century with the Science of Mind, and at least 18 other books dealing with the aspects of what the author terms SECRET. She honors those with whom I am not familiar, she did her home work. Many of those she quotes would have known or known of Ernest Holmes.Carl Rosen"
5,Nice to have,"I bought ""The Secret"" DVD when it came out on The Secret web site and found it most helpful, but as with all video media too encumbering. The audio book version of The Secret is a nice addition to the DVD. I listen to it while driving around town and to and from work etc. If you liked the DVD and want to spend more time with the principles contained within, this audiobook will be most helpful to you."
4,The Secret,The book is well written and attractive. Most of the content is a review of the information covered in various books and lectures. I would recommend this book to my friends.
4,The Secret,I thought it was a great book... Very easy to listen to and most of the things they talked about are things we already know but don't think to apply...I also learned a lot from this book and it is a great book to give you a boost to acheive things you want.
5,The Secret,What I have wondered about for some time. Finally a conformation that you need to lister to the inner voice and not the outer voices of the nay sayers.
3,The Secret to reading the secret,"I thought that this book had so much information to share with people, but it is so difficult to get ""into"" the book. It took me about 3 weeks just to finish 20 pages. Overall though, its a book full of wonderfull information to help all of us get what we want out of life."
1,Pseudoscience,"This book just spits out things like, ""This has been scientifically proven."" There is not an ounce of real, hard science in this entire book. I can't believe people actually buy into this garbage. This is just page after page of pseudoscientific nonsense and people just gobble it up because The Great Oprah put it on her book list. James Randi is right, Oprah should be ashamed of supporting this drivel."
2,The Secret review by JB,"I like the physical presentation of the book including the size of the book,letterings, and colors of the pages. I especially like the different page printings. It is very easy and relaxing to look at the pages. I have only gotten about 1/3 through the book and I have mixed feeling so far. I think the basic idea of the book is the ""power of positive thinking"" of which I am a firm believer.....as of now I am finding it hard to get back to it but will finish just because that is the only fair way to really access the book for myself."
3,The Secret,Interesting but no cigar! This is a excellent re-packaging of several previous books without the spiritual uplift.
1,"Wish-thinking, the book","Well, I'm not of the mind that the universe in all of its grandeur actually cares about the in's and out's of day-to-day human life. If you are arrogant and self-centered enough to believe that the universe cares about you and wants to provide for you, if you think that it's ""about you,"" then this book is for you. Or, an introductory astronomy textbook, one quick glance at which will reveal that the universe is hardly ""about us."" ""The Secret"" is just the author/cohorts trying to make money off of people by telling what they want to here by stroking their egos and appealing to their emotions. Save your money and buy Michael Schermer's book ""Why People Believe Weird Things."""
1,Sad Puesdoscience,"Its kinda sad how much money you can make off the true unhappiness in America.The old saying is true, money doesn't buy happiness. America is the richest and probably the most unhappy country in the world. Is it really a surprise a book like this would sell so much here and not in Australia, where it was made, and not even popular enough to be shown on T.V. there?When are people going to understand that all the possessions they try to get their hands on won't take away the sheer emptiness they feel inside.I wish more people in this county would've gone to college and taken at least one psychology class, this is nothing but pure pseudoscience."
3,It is up to the reader,"It is up to the reader to believe what the book features as ""The Secret"", but in my personal case after looking for an opportunity to make an extra income out of my ordinary job, I focused my mind in the way the book suggests, and such opportunity, a good one to pursue, showed up 6 months later. I am going to keep it in my e-reader as a source of inspiration and reference"
5,no wonder it's a best seller,this book it incredible! it offers a different perspective on life that is very encouraging and positive. great read for anyone that desires more from life.
1,Religion of Self at it best,"Just as the Secret promo says, it is a gathering from throughout time of information. The unfortunate of that information though is that YOU ARE YOUR OWN GOD. It is the false religion of self worship that has existed throughout history. Unknowing to the product purchasers is that they are the one's being used to fulfill another infomercial salespersons Secret of wealth pursuit through your money."
1,I wish I could give this a negative number of stars,"Because frankly, this is the kind of self defeating, harmful books that shouldn't even be published. I am a scientist who has studied subjects such as Quantum mechanics at length. I am completely baffled and disappointed that people could manufacture this in the name of science. There is no secret. There is only a whole bunch of ridiculous lies with no factual basis. Please don't buy this book and continue to make these people rich. They are earning money at the expense of the public's knowledge. That is the worst, most horrible secret possible."
1,what rubbish!,"the writing quality is poor, the examples cited questionable, the theories risable, and it comes wrapped in da vinci code-esque packaging.should be in the fantasy section. good luck to anyone who puts their faith in this 21st century cargo cult. one of the few times when TV is a better investment of time than reading."
1,Horrible,"The Law of Attraction, concerning ""The Secret"" is laughable at best. I am a firm believer of the power of positive thought but to imply that the Universe awards people with items, clothing, power, and money, simply because they think of them, is ridiculous. With all the impossibly illogical and blatantly false religions that still occupy mainstream society, do we need another Cult of Stupidity? Buy this book for a good laugh, not for self improvement"
5,Change Your Attitude!!,"I purchased this book and also in DVD form. It is an amazing help for the self, especially when the spirit of a person is down and out. I have put many of the ""secrets"" into action and I have seen a drastic change in my world. I highly recommend this item!!"
1,"this is witchcraft, plain and simple...","I dont get the hype here, this is nothing new and this is no ""secret"", the book and the movie are presenting the teachings of witchcraft wrapped in a differnt package. I think dabbling in energy work can be dangerous, perhaps if i focus my energy on what i want, then i will get it, but perhaps what i get is not what i should have gotten, perhaps the universe knows more than I, perhaps God knows more about what i need than i do, I think the better approach to accept what we are given, there is no harm in having desires, but being greedy and craving money and power, and wanting material possesions so bad that you try and force your will and practice withcraft is obsurd to me, this is only my opinion."
1,New Age Hocus-Pocus garbage,"I could only make it through about half this book. It is a bunch of garbage. I hope that Penn and Teller do a segment on this in their show BS. What is the secret? The power of positive thinking!! That is it! They attribute successes to ""fung shei"" garbage like putting your couch in a spot for positive energy.This is a waste of time. The secret is not really a secret. Think happy thoughts and they come true. Sure they do!"
1,The Secret is that your getting ripped-off.,"I had a friend who read this book and then passed it along to me. I hold a bachelors in Physics and could not believe anyone would buy into this baloney. This is not science or even logical; it's just a bad case of wishful thinking. This is just like giving a ""fortune"" teller or ""psychic"" your money to hear what you want to hear. Please do not give this con-artist your money or your time. The real ""secret"" to being successful in life is to ask questions, seek answers, make mistakes and learn from them, and above all stay determined."
1,Complete waste of time,"This is by far one of the worst books I've ever read (listened to). It's completely redundant, repeating itself ad nauseum. Not to mention the fact that it's very shallow and does not fully develop the ideas, not to mention the fact that there is not a unique idea covered here. The author reads a sentence, then includes a clip of another motivational speaker basically repeating the same thing. This whole book could be summarized in 1 concise paragraph, I can boil it down to one catch phrase: ""You create your own self-fulfilling prophecy, good or bad."" I cannot fathom how this got published much less became a best seller."
1,Dangerous,"This book and others of its ilk are MacDonald versions of what greats of our time have already introduced. I find it to be insulting ...and frankly, quite dangerous."
1,Interesting theory,Goes a long way towards explaining infanticide and paedophilia. All those kiddies and their negative thoughts...
2,Infinitely Rehashed Message,"I can't believe the popularity of this book. Let's first set aside the ridiculous notion that we can all control the universe. If we could all control the universe, it would be chaos. When you boil the notions of the book down, it has a few very simple messages. Think positive, do what you should do, visualize your dreams. HEY RHONDA! That's no secret - its been rehashed by every self help author for over 100 years. For you to take credit for it is just silly."
1,Total Nonsense,"This book is the biggest pile of Bull-dust I have ever had the misfortune to waste my time on. Self-absorbed, narcissistic America, take some air of out your so-called self-esteem, get over yourselves, get your hands dirty and get a life, and work towards the kind of life you really want instead of wishing and hoping that some ""secret"" will bring it to you. Do yourselves a really big favour and pitch this book into the nearest trashcan.One more thing; Has anyone who's ever read this book actually experienced a material improvement in their lives? Conversely, have any individuals whom the world has deemed ""successful"" gotten there from reading ""The Secret""? Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Steve Wynn, et al reading ""The Secret""? I don't think so..."
1,It's been said before,"This book is a glossy, re-packaged version of better books: Pick up anything by Dr. Wayne Dyer or Anthony Robbins, and you'll get the same thing -- and more. It is the LAW OF ATTRACTION. This book is colorful and designed to have some ""mystery"" to it -- capitalizing on the DaVinci code mystery of ""ancient secrets."" Hats off to Rhonda Byrne for saying the same thing that's been said before, but dumbing it down and oversimplifying it for the masses. This isn't new stuff, and it is no secret. It's the LAW OF ATTRACTION -- Go buy Wayne Dyer or Tony Robbins or Terry Cole Whittaker or Dr. Norman Vincent Peale or anyone else -- much better and more insightful, same stuff. I feel ripped off buying this book; it's all about selling the ""mystery,"" not about anything new. It's not deep, not insightful, but should win an award for graphics -- but not for content."
1,A very sad statement of where we are,"After having heard some glowing reviews by acquaintances, I bought the CD version of The Secret. It was incredibly disappointing. The author comes across as a late night infomercial saleswoman, repeating and repeating her message with no development. There are vestiges of real spiritual knowledge here, but her 'teachers' are third rate, in general. The most important spiritual messages are being are ignored in favor of enticing people with the idea of money as an end in itself. People, there is much better spiritual guidance out there! Do not jump on this bandwagon! Written with love."
4,Good to listen to..,"I liked this cd, it's good to listen to especially if your not feeling very up about life, its alot of what I have heard before but still a great listen."
5,The Secret [] Different,I am not too great at reviews but would definitely buy this again.It has information other books of self help doesn't have.
1,Sounds Like Someone's Reliving the 60s.,"Now, I believe in the power of positive thinking. A good attitude and a lot of hard work can get you far. I also believe that there is nothing more positive for your soul than to care for and help those who are sick, hungry or alone. To exclude them from your life is to set yourself up as being somehow better than them. Always remember the story of Job.IMO, this book is a jumble of rehashed, 60s psychobabble created for the sole purpose of making money for the authors. All that's missing are the love beads and the Jim Morrison posters on the wall. A positive attitude is a wonderful asset when it comes to dealing with life's problems. However, visualizing Hummers will not make it happen. And, the truth is, that Hummer will not make you any happier with yourself then you are right now.So, don't bother to buy this book. Learn to like yourself, help others when you can and work hard. If you don't get all the ""stuff,"" you really didn't need it anyway."
1,CRAP,"I cannot believe how people suddenly feel compelled by The Secret. It's crap, crap, crap. I cannot believe that Oprah would even back this book up. My boyfriend has the book and all he does is talk about The Secret, but refuses to answer any real hard questions when I ask him and dances around the whole thing. The DVD is mystical nonsense. It's just another fab that a few people are getting rich off. The reality is, BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE NO MATTER HOW MUCH GOOD ENERGY YOU SEND OUT. The fact that you can get anything you want by asking the universe and reaching for positive energy is stupid and crap. I can't believe people are brainwashed by this garbage!"
2,Disappointing,"I have read a few books on powers of the mind, from works on Eastern philosophy to Western psychology. I would describe this book as mildly entertaining but very light on substance. I was hoping for a bit more in terms of concrete historical evidence as well as respected expert testimonials. I agree with S. Winters' comment that the book read like a cheesy, feel-good infomercial. I can see how this book can appeal to some, but I would have preferred something a little more academic."
1,"The Secret about ""The Secret""","The real secret is that if you want to make a million, write yet another New Age book (no doubt many will just update Norman Vincent Peale), visualize yourself on Oprah, and make a million. Meanwhile, those living in the USSR in 1956, a concentration camp in 1942, as a dhimmi in Saudi Arabia, or any one of a million other situations, this book isn't going to help one whit.Now, back to visualizing ""world peas"" and trying to ""stop global farming!"""
1,the secret,"I would like to know what the advocates of ""The Secret"" would say to the women in Darfur who are being raped? Are these women thinking negative thoughts, so they deserve it? And what about the child who dies of a fatal disease? Was that child sending bad thoughts into the universe? Maybe it's his parents' fault, for their negativity?If this book weren't so horribly insulting to people whose lives are full of suffering and sadness, it would be insipidly laughable. The only thing smart about ""The Secret"" is the title; what an ingenious marketing ploy!"
1,The Secret,This book takes the laws of the universe and destroys their credibility. Hopefully this fad diet of junk food will go away soon.
3,Better than Creative visualization.,"These people had parts of the secret; but not the whole enchilada.This book IS better than the Creative Visualization books because the secret uses visualization, emotions, AND faith.This is all well and good, and it works to some degree; but there is more to it than these three parts of the secret.I credit the author for getting as much of the secret as she did; but there is a critical part of the secret that is missing. That of consciously gathering additional energy (ch'i, ki, mana, prana and other names) and sending this energy to the higher powers to bring the prayer action into manifestation.For the Higher powers to work on our behalf they need energy from this plane in order to work on our behalf on this plane.The ones who knew all of the secret were the pre-Christian Hawai'ian kanunas dating back to around 14,000 years ago.The people the author mentioned in the book and DVD only have fragments of the secret."
3,The Secret Review,"I belive in the main premis of the book in that positive thinking does help bring positive situations to you. I belive you also need to do something to get that positive action going, not just wishing it true which is what the book seems to say."
2,The secret ain't so secret,"The book is well-written. Most people will enjoy it. However, if you really want to know what the secret is, simply buy a book that was written in the 1950's called: The Power of Positive Thinking."
2,Very repetitive,"Their concept is accurate--you can bring whatever you want into your life; however there is so much repetition in this book, mainly different people saying the same thing."
1,SELFISH,"YOU ARE ALL SELFISH. What is this book about? It is the same philosophy as when you were four and you thought the purpose of praying was to get something you wanted, like a shiny bicycle. This is not new. This is not revolutionary. It says the same thing that every inspirational speaker has talked about, only maybe in slightly better writing."
2,Good principals wrapped in a sensationalist television producers marketing scheme,"These SECRETS are a rehash of good principals wrapped in a blanket of sensational marketing schemes. It's as if Amway got ahold of the bible and started selling it like an ""AS SEEN ON TV"" miracle product.She over sensationalizes everything, perverting the original messages. WHOOOOOOO AHHHHHHHH. I know! Let's bow to a golden alter and sacrificing virgins.Do we really need someone to wrap potentially good philosophy into a Davinci Code rip off?"
1,Wonderfully simple secret,"I have to hand it to the author. She certainly took advantage of the secret and THE SECRET is this: write an inane and completely ludicrous book... make it simple... and a million empty people will buy it... and she will become rich.This is a pet rock, folks. No, I didn't mean that. Comparing this book to a pet rock would be insulting the rock."
1,Shallow,"This book is kind of shallow and the format is so confusing. It didn't help even a bit. All the bits and pieces, I already know. It doesn't give clear instructions on what should be done. It is just a collage of famous phrases and thoughts from other people."
4,Maybe?,"After reading The Secret I took the advise offered within and ask the ""Universe"" for a one thousand dollar unexpected windfall within 30 days. I received a five thousand dollar unexpected windfall within six days. Coincidence? Maybe . . ."
3,A secret about The Secret,"Although this is old news for those of us who have been fans of Catherine Ponder,and others who know the power of mental attitude and imaging, it has been repackaged in The Secret in a way that makes it attractive and easy to digest. A bit too simplistic at times (it doesn't allow for outside events that just sort of happen to you)it is still good reading and makes some valuable points. But The Secret isn't telling us anything we haven't already heard."
5,The Secret,"The Secret is very interesting and will work if you are open to ideas. If you have read The Power of Intention by Dr. Wayne Dyer and The Success Principals by Jack Canfield then this book will be a refresher course. Other authors that support the ideas in The Secret - Zig Ziglar, W.Clement Stone and Napoleon Hill. The Secret is a more concise and to the point."
3,The Secret Circle of the Law of Attraction,"You know how you can meet someone for the first time and forever be stuck with the first impression of either liking them or hating them. This is the basic premise for the law of attraction which is The Secret. We are attracted to others (people and things) and others are attracted to us that match our vibration. This vibration has been refered to by many names: feelings, aura, energy, intuition, etc.So whether it's The Secret by Rhonda Byrne, The Law of Attraction by Michael Losier, or the Circle by Laura Day, you are going to get the same results! These are all good practical books written on the same subject, just by different authors. No matter which you pick up you are sure to start attracting what you want most in life."
4,Perfect size,"Nice hardcover with jacket included. Although the book has the perfect size for carrying it everywhere, the printing should be much larger."
4,Inspires positive thinking,"""The Secret"" inspires positive thinking and high self-esteem. It's helped me to be more aware of what I'm thinking and has helped me to slow my mind down to savor the things that are wonderful in my life. It teaches that attitude is everything and that attitude contributes to the law of attraction. I think it also inspires people to really think about what their true passions are in life. I can see why some people would be skeptical of 'making things happen' through your thoughts, but I think that if nothing else, it helps train your brain to think more positively."
1,Never got book,"No response from Warehouse Deals, despite repeated attempts to contact. I'll never use this seller again."
1,"Silly at best, dangerous at worst","It is no surprise that thinking positively, envisioning what you'd like, making goals to reach your dreams, and then working hard to achieve them is bound to engender more success than thinking negatively, being directionless and lazy. That's not a secret, it's just logic. However, this book takes positive, proactive living to a silly, ridiculous level. The idea that the bad things that happen in life happen because a person ""attracted"" them is arrogant, cruel, and dangerous. And for the people for whom the ""secret"" doesn't work? The people selling this - and that's what it is; sales pitch - would say that it is that person's own fault because they didn't believe enough. What a convenient excuse. It allows them to utterly avoid culpability or scrutiny. There's nothing new here - just old snake oil in new bottles."
1,You've got to be kidding,"Do the laws of attraction work for the people of Darfur? How about the homeless men and women I pass on my way to work each day, many of them suffering with addictions and mental illnesses? Did the people dying of pancreatic cancer in the hospital across the street fail to practice ""The Secret"" properly? How about the many children in my state who go to bed hungry each night? This book panders to our middle class concept that OUR financial success, OUR weight, OUR wants, are the thoughts on which we should concentrate. Positive thinking about war or hunger will bring an end to them? Drivel is much too gentle a word for the ideas promoted in ""The Secret."""
2,very disappointed,"I read the book for about 1/2 hour and couldn't persist further. Nothing new, full of banalities and platitudes. Also obviously an easy collage of quotations. I can't figure out why it ranks as one of the bestsellers. Perhaps the minds of our modern populace are so softened in this age that readings not requiring much cerebral work hold great appeal."
1,Attack on Rational Thought,"While I would be happy to read a book that was legitimately about the capacity and propensity of positive thinking to create opportunities for success, this book was a complete and utter attack on rational thought. It suggests one should never think about anything negative in their lives for fear that they might attract it. It claims you can not even think about not wanting such things because that, too, will bring negativity into your life. It's embarassing that we live in a culture where a book denouncing thought and rational decision making can be so popular."
1,Bunk,Pseudo science wrapped in an ad to sell items on their website. Utter trash. This has nothing to do with Buddhism. I spent 7 months thinking I was king of Norway and have yet to have a call from anyone even slightly Norwegian...
2,It never was a secret ...,"There is nothing new in this book. Yes, the mind has an incredible power and our own spirutal vibration has the most influence on ourselves and a similar, but weaker one on our environment. I agree: believe in yourself, love yourself and the people next to you, set your mind to your goals and think positively. Why does that require 200 pages?"
1,Misleading,"My intension was to purchase a used CD. Instead, a book arrived. I will never shop with Amazon again."
2,Nothing New,"If you've read ""Power of Positive Thinking"" or any of the hundreds of other books in the same vein, this one offers nothing new. Stylishly presented, but the same sales pitch over and over. If you are just curious, as I was, I'd recommend you check it out of the local library. Save your money for a REALLY good book!"
2,The Secret is not new,"While the seller did a stellar job of delivery, the ""book"" did not. This collection of homilies and opinions from people with advanced degrees does little to back up the ""meat and potatoes"" of the so-called secret. A couple of paragraphs would have said what most people need to know about this subject. Does the ""secret"" work? If you are healthy and have your concrete needs met, perhaps it will work for you. However, if you are seriously ill or care for a disabled child or are wondering where your next meal will come from, the ""secret"" loses its power to reality."
1,Click your heels and make a wish,"While positive thinking is never a bad thing, you should not need a book replete with new age psycho babble and banal generalities in order to get it. This book is pandering to your base emotions and makes pretend that if you wish hard enough for something it will happen. No it won't. Wishing won't make the cancer disappear, or your sex change, or your leg grow back, or your son come back to life or any number of countless horrible things that happen to normal people. ""Lifestyle"" books like this that make pretend that if you make a wish it will become true are simply fads. This book will end up in the remainder bin just like all those that preceded it. Save your money and start setting yourself realistic goals and expectations if you really want to change your life in a positive way."
1,Ask yourself two questions,"One, if this secret is really so valuable and will help so many people, why not make it free instead of charging for it? Two, ever notice how these rehashed ""secrets"" always seem offer ""help"" in how to make money? I watched a TV show where the people promoting the secret spoke almost exclusively about using it to a) make money b) lose weight c) find a compatible romantic partner, with a little lip service to offering true help without desire for remuneration. Making money, being thin and getting laid. Wow, what a secret."
5,"Are you nah sayers reading the book, or just the cover??","This is one of the best audio books I've ever listened to as far as self help. It has helped me tremendously in my everyday life as far as happiness, money, self esteem. You have to listen (or read) this book many times to catch on, and you have to believe in it, and once you get it...watch out, your life will be totally differant. The one review that said just believe in JC, well duh, if you listen closly to this book, thats some of the points this book makes. The reviewers that put this book down are people that want instant gratification, and don't want to work at it.(law of attraction) All I can say is that this book has changed my life so much for the better! I can't thank Rhonda enough!!"
1,The Secret,"I thought I was purchasing the DVD of The Secret.......instead I received the book. I was very, very disappointed and as it is impossible to return items to individual person's stores.........I am stuck with it and probably won't read it.I really thought it was the DVD.........Amazon should make this more visible."
4,Great Inspirational Reading,"This is a great inspirational read. You must maintain an open mind and accept a new way of looking at your life within the universe. If you live by the code of ""what you do reflects upon you"" than you will definitely find yourself in this book."
1,The Secret to Financial Success ...,"... is NOT positive thinking, the 'law of attraction,' or any other such nonsense.When the U.S. economy collapsed in the fall of 2008, one cannot help but notice that ""positive thinking"" was never, ever, ever proposed as a solution to the economic problems by anyone in any serious position of authority.Not a single person on either side of the aisle in congress; nor by anyone on Wall Street.Why? Because 'positive thinking' is simplistic and doesn't work.Skip this book."
1,Can not rate it if I never received it!,Amazon.comYou are just gotten too big. Your customer service department is useless.I never received my book. I have made several attempts to start a search to track it down but your system is just too big to care for a small person like me. I will never buy a book or anything from you in my life. I am glad that it only cost me 20 dollars to figure this out.Walter
4,Good Book,"Good introduction for understanding the ""Law of Attraction."" I also recommend Catherine Ponder's, ""The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity"", along with any works by Florence Scovel Shinn."
2,"Old concept, new book","There is no secret about the information contained in this book. The concept of creating your own reality is quite old. Wayne Dyer writes about it in The Power of Intention. Norman Vincent Peale writes about it in The Power of Positive Thinking. There's another book called As a Man Thinketh, which leads me to my point. This concept is in the Bible itself. Jesus said if you believe, you can say to a mountain, ""Get up and throw yourself into the sea and it will be done."""
1,Nothing we have not seen before,"Positive thinking is good because it sets you into ACTION. And ACTION is what makes things happen. You don't need to spend $25 dollars in a 200 page book to know that, or do you? Oh wait! This is not the message of the book! You don't have to take action just think and wait...I should change my career and became a motivational speaker, Americans believe anything these days..."
2,I had high hopes for this book!,"I was really excited to read this book! However...once I started reading I was really really disapointed to see quotes from two 'hype n type' authors. I then found it hard to take this book seriuosly because of this. Joe Vitale is a author who punches out pretty much useless ebooks and over priced ones at that, and Dr Martini (I'm not joking - formally married to Australia's answer to miss cleo Athena starwoman - yah lots of credibitlty there!) However I do like the other points made by other contributors to this book however I do think that this is just a revamped smaller version of the book 'Ask and it is given' ...this book is just repackaged idea's and beliefs made public by other authors."
1,All Hype,"I got sucked in the whole ""The Secret"" movement by friends who thought the concept was unbelievable. I purchased the book and am struggling to finish it. This book is a bunch of malarky. The overall theme is to think positive. The book insists that we have control over every aspect of our life. If there is something we want, we will receive it if we believe we already have it. Most of the advice is common sense. Bottom line: Save your money."
5,"Outstanding, motivational, inspiring read!","This is the best book to come along in a long, long, time. Motivational and inspiring. Positive and well worth the read. Keep an open mind - not your traditional self-help book. You have to understand and appreciate the law of attraction to ""get"" where Rhonda is coming from.I refer to The Secret when I need positive reinforcement, or to change my perspective when the daily routine gets to be overwhelming. As an entrepreneur, I appreciate the ""never give up"" message. Have recommended this book to several friends and business associates, and will continue to do so. Suzanne Wells, author -Stay-At-Home Mom's Guide to Successful eBay<sup></sup> Selling"
1,Please take your message to the world!,"Now that Ms Byrne has revealed the secret of the law of attraction, I hope that she plans to travel to Africa where she can help those poor people in Darfur to stop attracting genocide and others from attracting the AIDS epidemic. Apparently Hitler was a master of The Secret, but pity all those Jews in the Holocaust for misaligning the universe against themselves. . . This book is hogwash!"
3,It's no Secret,"The book was very good at making me aware of my thoughts. I think the world would be a much better place if everyone focused on good things. I think thoughts without actions are useless. This is not a religion, it's changing your thought patterns. People should stop blowing it out of proportion."
1,this book is a scam,"this author is trying to take credit of other famous people thinking, calling it ""her great secret"", which of course is nothing new, everybody already knows that been possitive is healthy. the rest of the book is just garbage, not recomended at all, it may work for religion fanatics."
1,A book about nothing that isn't funny. No substance beyond the hype.,"This is a book about nothing but there aren't any laughs to be had. The joke is on you for having succumbed.There are a couple of good paragraphs in the book, contributed by other authors. They ought to be reading this book at Harvard Business School to work out how the author managed to publish this book and sequels with essentially no substance."
4,I prefer Positive,"I find it pretty funny that this book with its simple message that joy, love, and gratitude will create a better life for us than dwelling on the negative, is getting pages of lengthy negative rant reviews. Personally, it helped me through a dark day or two, so I recommend reading it. Take from it what you will."
5,......very nice collection of great thinkers......,.....such a great audio book............a very nice collection of truths............worth have it.......
3,I just don't know,"I read about half of the book which is very repetitive. I just don't know if I believe in The Secret... I have tried to think of the things I want not like a million dollars, but of a better job etc. and haven't found it worked. I guess I will try to stay positive and focus on what I really want, but I'm just not convinced."
5,The Secret,The book is in great shape. I ordered and it came as expected. I have really enjoyed reading this book
1,The secret is send cash and you will get nothing,I would give this a minus if I could. Save your money. You will get nothing for your investment other than a bunch of babble and double talk. Nonsense that will do nothing for you.Folks there is no free lunch in life and that is the true secret. My wife got it from a friend. She said read this.I wanted to keep an open mind so I read it. If I had paid for it I would have asked for my money back.Most motivational speakers / books are snake oil at best. The authors making a fortune preying on the hopeful but never doing anything of consequence themselves other than espousing babble but this Secret is the bottom of the barrel.
5,Attractive,"Excellent video for anyone looking to improve their way of life. It's common sense that is so often overlooked. See it, absorb it and watch your life change before your eyes."
1,What a pile of Camel Dung,"If you have lived a life of ease and a sheltered one, at that, you might believe all the stupid Philosophical mumbo-jumbo that is contained in this waste of time. If you have ever had to work for a dollar the hard way, You know, that dirty WORK word, then you will find this book to be one of the most ludicrous pieces of fiction you will ever read. Word to the wise, don't waste your time or your hard-earned money on this."
5,Anything is Possible,Thought provoking and nice to know that there are others that experience the same result of not accepting anything less that God's best.
5,Gresat book!,I've heard about this book and how good it was so i gave n and decided to buy one. Book was in great shape and also recv'd it fast!
1,More auld crap,Don't bother with this unless you are the sort of person who thinks reading the same thing over and over again is going to make you better at what ever it is you want to get better at.
2,I was suspicious about it,"but many friends were enthusiastic about it and I decided to read it because I cannot judge what I don't know.well. now I know it for sure. it's a mixture of stereotypes, common sense and bulls***."
2,what secret,"i was trying to find out the secret it was just so much info,so many words and it truly sounded like the same thing being said in different words repeatedly.not impressed or any more informed than before the purchase.the secret is save your money"
2,Rehashed Contrivance,I would not recommend this book to anyone. What truth there is to be found in it is buried beneath a lot of claptrap.
3,"The Secret, better in DVD","The Secret is an awesome way to live your life.The audio book, is OK but save your money and just by the DVD. You will get more out of it."
4,review,"very good and easyer to understand then what ""the blip do we know"" but we could do without annoncing the name every 3 minutes. a good tool!!!dvd was better for me..."
2,What would Jesus say?,"Why not just read the Bible? There's stuff in there like 'as a man thinks, so is he'... 'you reap what you sow'... 'let the weak say 'I am strong''... 'faith is the SUBSTANCE of things hoped for, the evidence of things unseen'... 'guard your heart with all due diligence'... 'if anything is good, noble, etc, think on these things'... i could go on for a while here.. but the Bible also says of Jesus 'without Me, you can do nothing'.. 'with praise and thanksgiving, let your requests be known to THE LORD'.. calling God 'the universe' as if the moon and stars will move on your behalf, is mumbo jumbo. I just bought this book because I wanted to learn more about the scriptures I have just quoted. But I just don't think a lot of this book is what God MEANT. Just a thought, I am still reading the book with a grain of salt, because it did start me thinking 'i feel good', and 'i'm healthy' etc.. and i DID begin to feel a whole lot better. But like I said, why not read the Bible?"
2,Prepare to suspend all logic,"The fundamental message of ""The Power of Positive Thinking"" is lost in the silliness of the claims and presentation. Good for a laugh."
3,"Good for what it is, but ....","Good book, but what it truly succeeded in doing was making return in an even deeper way to my Christian faith. That's where my strength really comes from, not a book (this one or any other) about psychology."
3,Worth the read,"I like to read self help books like Tony Robbins, Napoleon Hill,Norman Vincent Peale,etc.. The Secret, the book is inspiring yet I felt there were some conflicting ideas in different chapters. I would have also liked to see the references sited. There are some big statements made about events happening. I would like to know where they got each instance of historical info. or state it is speculation or theory. I also enjoyed the DVD which the book refers to several times. There as well, a bibliography would help."
5,Absolutely awesome!!,This is just the thing we needed in our fast-paced environment to help us focus on specific things to get our life in order. I've read it 4 times and given away 15 copies to close friends.
5,Simply the best book!,I just love this book it has helped my soooo much in my life. I was a divorced middle aged janitor at a grade school when I began reading it and now my life has done a complete 360!!!I have a girlfriend! Me a girlfriend!! It was really surprising to learn that the secret was nothing more than positive thinking...OOPS maybe I should'nt have given that away :( but still you should give this a read.
1,Stupid Book,"This is a very stupid book. It won't tell you any 'secret' that is useful to you. Take 'secret to money' as an example, the secret they tell you is just imagine you have a 100 thousand dollar check on your ceiling everyday."
2,not a big fan,"I bought this book a while back but just started reading it...not what I expected. I was debating whether to get this book or ""The Last Lecture"", and I opted to get this book. I don't understand how this book got such good reviews because it's pretty redundant and is not very insightful, it talks about the laws of attraction and how ""like attracts like"". I have not finished reading the book, but from what I have read, I'm not a big fan."
1,The real secret?,"The real secret is that ""The Secret"" is quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. It's incredibly cheesy with graphics, icons, quotes, and fancy paper, and it is largely lacking in content. The book is written as if based on science, but it is factually inaccurate. I think Byrne's point about the value of positive thinking (i.e. positive thinking improves health and happiness) is important, but there are dozens of books that do a better job of conveying this notion. I believe in the power of thought (though not in the ""Genie"" of the universe), but if I did not, I doubt this book would have convinced me. ""The Secret"" repeats itself, adding quotations from people who repeat themselves, and there is almost no specific evidence or anecdote to support its claims. Ironically (or not), Byrne's best support for her thesis is that she believed she could become rich, and she did -- by selling way too many copies of a lousy book."
1,Dishonest,"I won't try to expand on the work that has already been done in evaluating this book's merits, or lack thereof. I would simply say that the entire basis for this book, the invisible energy radiated by the individual, may have some merit, but it is certainly NOT a scientifically proven fact, as the book claims.For serious inquiry into this subject, I recommend Lynne McTaggart's Book, 'The Intention Experiment: Using Your Thoughts to Change Your Life and the World'."
4,Even without the mysticism it's still good advice.,People can throw stones at the mysticism all they want but the truth is The Secret can help you have a more positive and productive outlook on life.Even if you don't buy into the divine and supernatural aspect of the teachings included in The Secret you can improve aspects of your life by looking at the glass as half full rather than half empty.Even if that's all you take away from The Secret then it's still a winner.
2,Deceptive and materialistic,"I agree with the previous reviewers who mention that this book has many excellent aspects but is limited in some significant ways. In particular, I feel it is limited by putting much emphasis on achieving your desires.This book is seen as a 'spiritual' text but really it's anti-spiritual, since ultimately it promotes a kind of selfishness and egotism. You only need to read A New Earth or Steve Taylor's The FallThe Fall: The Evidence for a Golden Age, 6,000 years of Insanity and the Dawning of a New Erato realise that this deeper spiritual insight is lacking."
2,Age old principles in a pop culture wrapper,"Offers some decent principles about the ""rights and wrongs"" of life ... and puts a pop culture spin on the old adage that you are in control of your own destiny.A little too over the top for me to get more than 3/4 of the way through the book."
5,The Secret,"This is an awesome book!!!! What they are saying is soooo true, you have to have an open mind but it does work, give it a try, you will not be dissapointed."
5,So Thankful,I've watched the secret a few times years ago but never read the book. I was encouraged a couple weeks ago by a psychic that I met with to read this...as reading I watched it on Netflix a couple of times. I just loved READING this. I would read out loud to my kids also...such a benefit and I'm on to the Power! Thank you to all involved and thanks to Kelli for telling me to read this!
1,Didn't work for me at all,"I told the doctor my family didn't need any fancy flu shots, because we all know THE SECRET. For three years in a row, somebody in my family has gotten the flu. At first I thought somebody wasn't doing it right, so I made them all to read it again. Then this year we ALL got sick. Also, I thought this book could help me save money on smoke alarms, but THE SECRET didn't stop that electrical fire. Is there any way it can get us out of this shelter?"
5,Excellant!,Better than the DVD. I really liked all the extras but was glad that I saw the DVD first so I had the visual of the things discussed!
1,This books fails The Baloney Detection Test,"Expert Opinions?Anecdotal Evidence with no proof?""Secret"" information revealed?Regurgitated mysticism, new age new thought.This is not for anyone who has accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior. Ask your pastors about Christ Consciousness and the path it takes God fearing people down.Please know what you are getting into. This book looks nice on the surface, but it is, in actuality, promoting Hermetic Mysticism, a decidely UNCHRISTIAN practice that is currently being presented to you courtesy of the AMORC (Ancient Mystical Order of Rosi Cruis (The Rosicrucians, a cult group that is in the same category as freemasons, scientology, spirit channelers, etc. Beware the Gurus."
5,Hidden Treasures Buried in Earthen Vessels,"The heart of gnostic teachings (distilled ageless wisdom) is explored -- again. Although told time and time again (from Abraham to Atkinson), 'like attracts like' is still a startling revelation (hence, a 'secret'), at least to the unenlightened masses. Some other metaphysical books exploring the law of intention/attraction are: The Mind Magnet, The Celestine Prophecy, From Hunters To Healers, Quantum Healing."
1,A TRUE LIE ABOUT THE BIBLE,"This CD goes against everything that the BIBLE teaches us.I would encourage everyone to read their BIBLE and less ""Secret""."
3,The Unsecret Secret,"The ancient secret to a fulfilled life was revealed many years ago and continues to show up as it is re-discovered by new pilgrims on the path. Thank goodness we are no longer kept in the dungeon of limited thinking. The truth is out that we are masters of our own fate.Books by Ernest Holmes, Joel Goldsmith, Thomas Troward, Ester and Jerry Hicks, and others have revealed how to be healthy, wealthy and wise. Anytime we uncover the truth, it's time to celebrate.Elaine Maginn Sonne, PhD, Author of Stellar Secrets and Legends of the Stones."
4,Amazing!,"As a Substance Abuse counselor for teens, I will be using this book as a guide to run self-motivational groups. I think that our youth and children deserve the right to dream and truly believe. I think that has been robbed from us as a society. The more people believe in their selves the better society will become, and why not start with the youth! Although, I do not feel as though we can change our destiny and that should not be overlooked, I think we can change our path towards love peace and happiness within ourselves. It is important to take responsibilities for our actions but why not start with our inner thoughts . . . I was inspired by this book to continure motivating the youth, and I believe that it will work!"
2,"Now, I am as optimistic as a mime with a pager.","Of all the books I have ever read, this is certainly one of them. Actually, I have read only the first half, but I have read enough to form an opinion.This book is a rambling soliloquy with frequent quotes from people, most of whom are obscure or unknown.I will commend the author on one achievement. She has managed to hype this book and CD into a fifteen minutes of fame.Hugh StricklandDallas, Texas"
2,Disappointing,"Nothing really new here. Sort of a new age propaganda film, with inconsistencies, and silly statements not backed up (sure, positive thinking brought checks in the mail). A couple of people went beyond the blatantly materialistic tone of the movie, but mostly it was me-me-me."
1,PURE RUBBISH,"Come on people; start thinking for yourself. I can't beleive there are still poeple who are falling for this rubbish. I'm all for positive thinking and goal setting, etc. but this is just pure arrogance.Let me ask the author one question; how would you explain to the 911 victims that they were responsible for what happened to them?We are not gods, and we don't have 100% control over every thing in our lives."
4,uplifting,I throughly enjoyed this book. As I learn to work it into my life I find that I have started looking at the positive side of life.
4,Positive Thinking Unleashed,"Years ago I read Norman Vincent Peale's books on Positive thinking/attitude. It kept me in the right frame of mind to succeed when others typically give up. The Secret is the new century's version of these thoughts. I really enjoyed the Movie/DVD version, and I have purchased several extra copies for my 24 and 26 year old children. I now have the Book, the book on CDs, and the DVD movie. If you are looking for a practical ""How to"" book, the Law of Attraction by Michael Losier is short and well written. After one of my daughters watched the movie, she asked me several questions which I was able to answer by showing her the Law of Attraction book. Enough said."
4,Inspirational!,"I love the look and feel of the book. The pages and images are very appealing. I like that the author used other people's thoughts throughout the book. Although the message gets a little repetitive, it was still a nice addition. I would recommend this book to others.The Secret."
4,Secret,I was introduced to the Secrets by a friend. Listening to this CD has turned my life around. I have learned so much and have turned around from my old life style and now learning to live day by day positively. I am glad to have found the Secret.
5,informative,"Good information. So glad i found it. Words to live by, practice what you preach. I highly recommend this one."
1,Don't waste you money,"This book is nothing new, it is just the same old new age, metaphysical garbage that has been espoused for years. Basically, the idea is there are waves in the univers that you can latch onto. If you want wealth, latch onto the wealth waves; if you want to be skinny, latch onto the skinny waves, etc. It is ""name it claim it; gab it grab it; prosperity gospel"" without God."
1,Not a good choice,"This book may be one of the worst I have ever spent time with. Their are no actionable suggestions on how to improve your life--just a rambling conspiracy theory about a secret that all the smart people in history knew. Formal logic or objective information rarely comes into play. If you are looking for a book that can help you put yourself on a better track to success, this is not it. If you are looking for something funny that you can ridicule, The Secret is for you. One exception to what I have already said is that an aspiring author will probably get a huge amount of confidence from this book. If this fraud can get a book published, you can too."
4,The Power of Positive Thinking!,"This book, ""The Secret,"" tries to help the reader tap into the hidden power within. Through the use of positive thoughts one allegedly will attract money, power, health and happiness. On the other side of the coin one's negative thoughts will allegedly manifest illness, poverty, and catastrophes. This is a good book about positive thinking. I see people recommending in their reviews my"
2,Not What I Expected,"I heard all the craze about this ""Secret"", and how life changing it is. But, once I got the book, it was really hard for me to follow. I also felt it being very repetative and that was annoying. I guess I expected it to be more of a novel than a book of passages. I can't even get half way through it."
3,Just OK,"This book offers a few inspirational quotes, but I didn't buy the whole idea. It's great to think positively as a general way of life, and this book did speak to that concept. However, sending out positive thoughts to receive tangible items is too far fetched to me."
1,THE SECRET,"America is looking for a instant fix that requires little effort, just like the latest diet pills or fads!Does it sell? BY THE BILLIONS. My thoughts are, if this really works than every swinging Dick since the time of Caveman should have been layed by a beautiful women! 90% of all men sometime in their lives have thoughts about and desired this. How often did the really really ugly guy find success? Was it because he was thinking about truly ugly women? Hell no! magazine, movies, porn industry etc. fills our sences. Poor Joe 250 pounds overweight, does not bathe regularly, yellow teeth, shy, thick glasses, all he has to do put down the magazines with the gross girls in them and pick up the ones that are hot!"
2,It's all been said before,The real secret is how does the author convince us that this is a NEW idea?
2,Fluff...,"This is one of the many books i've read trying to find the ""answer"". This Secret is honestly a bunch of fluff and will leave you with the ""OK, now what?"" feeling. So, I took a year off from my life and wrote a book that filled in the blanks where this once misses the mark. It's available on amazon and it's called Live Like a Fruit Fly. Trust me, this book won't let you down. The life you hoped for can start today."
2,"This is the lite, lite version","Earl Nightingale, arguably the father of the concept of positive thinking, planted the seed for books of this ilk when he averred: ""We become what we think about"". Although this book contributes to a shift from negative to positive thinking, it's so lite that anyone who is into this topic, or wants to get real information on this topic, will take offense to the many randomly scattered statements that often make you say ""duh"". They possess the double whammy of not telling you much while lacking support. On the opposite scale, and I do mean opposite scale, there are books like Ordaining Reality which provide enough information as to how thoughts change outcomes to allow you to debate this topic with professional physicists. A newer version makes the case with a less hard science. It's not an easy read or real cheap, but this book clearly piques the interest of any serious reader of this topic."
3,The Secret Within,"Although I found some gems of wisdom here, I preferred Free Your Mind by Sensei Anthony Stultz to really unlock the secret treasure within.Free Your Mind: The Four Directions of an Awakened Life"
4,"If you have the movie, you don't need the book","I actually think the book ""The Secret"" is very good and offers the information in an easily understandable format. However, it is literally a word for word duplication of the movie and therefore a waste of money for anyone who already owns the movie."
1,Waste of time and money,"While The Secret may bring wealth to those selling these books and DVDs, don't expect it to do the same for you.I will grant you that the power of positive thinking can help people cope with difficulty and may improve their lives. This, however, is common knowledge. You don't need to purchase this book to learn that.Other than this simple lesson (worthy of 1 star), this book's main value is that of a coaster or door stop. Save your money."
1,"Cheapest, most shallow pop philosophy you can find","I watched the movie version out of perverse curiosity, becuase someone I know -- who is a serial adherent of new agey philisophies -- was interested in it.The sheer lack of content was amazing. One simple message repeated ad-nauseum. The movie doesn't even have any good sense of progression or climax to it -- just hammering the message from start to finish.And this is about the least deep message you can find.This is suitable for the intellectual infatuation of a high school student, but to see that the book is #8 on amazon gives me a deep chill."
1,"""If Wishes Were Horses...""","...Beggers Would Ride"".. there is nothing wrong with positive thinking, however if I want a mountain to move, I had better pick up a shovel regardless if I whistle while I work..If we want success, quality of life, security and happiness, we may want to consider Thomas Jefferson's writings and implement some of his thoughts into our daily lives. We would have much better outcomes."
1,Utter nonsense.,"Positive thinking is good, yes. The universe, however, does not react to our thoughts. Wishes don't come true by wishing hard enough. There's really nothing left to say about it. This is the tired speech you hear from motivational speakers, but with unfounded ""historical facts"" and unfounded ""science"" to back up its, frankly, supernatural claims."
1,Total Load of Crap,"Seriously, anything remotely good out of this is common sense and the rest is mumbo-jumbo mysticism crap. Just the biggest load I've seen since Christianity. There is NOT mystical force of the Universe that you can tap, it's just you, yourself, and thee. So many people have just taken this bile hook, line and sinker and they will rapidly find that sitting on their asses just thinking of what they want will only get them a long time of sitting on their asses. Please please PLEASE just burn this book if possible and go outside and enjoy yourself and life. YOU are the only power that can control your destiny or empower you to do so."
1,Grow Up,"Believing that your thoughts and frame of mind can alter reality is delusional, narcissistic, and immature. I would condemn this book for misleading people and wasting their time, but anyone who would believe that nonsense in the first place is already a lost cause anyway. For those people, I hope Santa is good to you this year."
1,Naive at best,"This book claims that optimism will solve all life problems. This is the most ridiculous claim I have encountered for a long time. In rare occasions where the situation is laid out such that your attitude determines the outcome, this might work - however, these scenarios are so rare that the unrealistic outlook presented by this book is not worth mentioning in isolation."
5,I love it,"When I first heard 'Cabin Fever!', I found only a couple of songs accessable. Right off the bat, i fell in love with 'Hunter's Kiss', 'Sweet Water Kill', and 'Remnants of Percy Bass'. Over time, however, this album grew on me. It is very different from Ether and How we quit the Forest, but there are still bits and pieces of them in Cabin Fever. Although it is not to the same calibur as the masterpiece How we Quit the Forest, it is definately just as good as Thanks for the Ether. If you are fan of Rasputina's heavier songs, this album will not dissapoint, but if you are expecting the sweet, rich melodies of Ether, than you might be put off."
3,Not what I expected,"I loved Thanks for the Ether and How We Quit the Forest. That said, I wasn't too impresed with Cabin Fever. How We Quit The Forest was produced by Chris Vrenna, ex drummer of NIN and the brains behind Tweaker. I would have to say that was my favorite album from Rasputina. But Cabin Fever just didn't....do it for me. Nothing was really surprising or inspiring to me. I still enjoy it, but was expecting something else."
3,I don't really like this one.,"I don't have much to say about it. I listened to it once, and it was too loud, raspy and it hurt my ears at times.The date thing was hilarious though, and that gives the album 3 stars alone. I laughed my ASS off at that.*grins*"
1,The worst I ever hear from her!,"It was like a pain in the ass listennint one of these terrible songs with Banda.First: The ""Banda"" music is for the very very low class.Second: The lyrics sound forced to fit in that kind of music.Third: Is really repetitive.After the Love CD, Everrything that Thalia is doing is worst!"
5,THALIA BANDA GRANDES EXITOS IS EXPLOSIVE,"THIS IS ONE OF THALIAS BEST ALBUMS EVER IT CONTAINS 3 OF HER OLD HIT ALBUMS TAKING ALL OF THE HITS OF THE 3 ALBUMS TO FORM THIS EXPLOSIVE ALBUM OF ""EXITOS"" IT IS TRULY A MAGNIFICENT CD IT WILL PUT YOU TO DANCE THIS CD CONTAINS GREAT HITS I LOVE IT AND YOU WILL TOO, IT IS SO GOOD THAT ON IT'S (1.ST) WEEK OF RELEASE IT HIT THE #50 LATIN BILLBOARD CHARTS TOPING AT THE HOT SHOT DEBUT OF POSITION (# 2) SO SAYING THAT YOU CANT GO WRONG THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST IT IS HIGHLY RECOMENDED"
4,Thalia con banda grandes exitos,"I will say, first that I LOVED Arrasando, it was Thalia's best album. This one, takes a bit getting used to and I think it would have been a superb record if she would have recorded ACTUAL songs written specifically for the gender rather than a greatest hits record. Nevertheless, its a very good record and although some songs do not work in this format, she made a great effort and did the best she could with the translations from pop to banda. I would suggest her next effort be true banda songs which would give her more credibility and an opportunity to dig into the work. In this case, she succeeded, but I think the songs would have served her better if they were truly banda compositions. in this case, she was working with her hands tied behind her back, so I give her 4 stars. Can't wait for the English record next year"
3,Alright album,The music is alright but it wears heavily on you after a while. If you don't like faux Banda then buy one of her pop albums.There is a nice mini poster in there though.
5,Thalia a la Mexicana!!!,"This is a great CD. Thalia does a magnificant job of taking her greatest POP hits and converting them into BANDA hits. I really don't listen to banda music, but this CD does a great job of making you an instant banda lover. I recommend it to every one."
2,"Ghor, Kin-Slayer: The Saga of Genseric's Fifth-Born Son","I have been a fan of Mr Howard for nearly 12 years now, which in my opinion, makes me a bit of a connoisseur, and frankly this book was a bit of a disappointment. Undoubtedly the contributing writers are well-respected and immensely able but their writing lacked the Howardian flavour I have come to love. Ghor's sudden personality shifts are hard to follow and the various ideas in the story lack sufficient depth. This book is not the way Mr Howard would have written it. Nevertheless, this should be read because the original idea belonged to the great REH."
5,Good Morning Monday Afternoon,"The title of the cd is so very accurate. You can't listen to this album without feeling good. It's quite a nice contrast to the wide expanse of negative or feel good music. The poignancy of this record is expressed in, ""Bite Size Pieces"": 'Hey Mr. Radio what's that song with the singer that pronounces his words all wrong?/Play me a song not meant to make me feel small'. The song's poppy, but with a real indie punk vibe, somewhat reminiscent of Sloan, rather than all that pretend Nu-Garage junk. My favorite track is the first, ""Magdaline,"" in which the lead singer calls his significant other Magdaline (as in Mary Magdalene of the bible) and refers to himself as Jesus. I found this quite an interesting idea. The lyrics on this cd are very clever without being comical and therefore avoiding the rut of a joke band. ""Good morning monday afternoon..."""
4,Unevenly great,"THis is definitely one of Mr. Keita's better works. In fact, it may be exceeded only by his last album, Folon. There are a couple of jams here and ""Papa"" the title track is stirring. There are just a couple places where things get bland. But overall, it is Salif at his dramatic best."
4,Incredible and soul stirring Afropop at it's best!,"I picked this CD up yesterday, and I am amazed at the consistent brilliance of all the numbers. Salif Keita's voice is the best and really stirred me to feel heartache. I wish he produces more brilliant material like this."
4,Salif's best,"""Papa"" achieves the confluence of east and west that Keita has sought for years. Credit co-producer Vernon Reid for knowing just when to insert a wild guitar solo or backup chicks singing english and when to shut up and let Salif wail. While not as propulsive as some Afropop, this one is hook-filled and straightforward enought to win over even reluctant American listeners. World music, indeed."
3,A total disappointment,"I love Salif Keita's music. I have all of his albums. But, this one is his worst recording since his first album (lead singer of the Rail Band of Bamako). I hope this is not a decline in his musical talent."
2,Last Album is much better than this one...,"I listened only to the samples here so I at least rated it 2 stars. I HIGHLY recommend his last album, FOLON. Great all the way through! Pass on this one though."
4,A good remake,"This is Mervyn LeRoy's 1949 Technicolor MGM remake of the Louisa May Alcott classic.While it's not as good as George Cukor's 1933 RKO Katharine Hepburn version,it's still good entertainment on its own terms.The sets,costumes,and photography are lovely and well backed by a goodAdolph Deutsch music score.The performances are very good,with June Allyson and Janet Leigh particularly outstanding under LeRoy's solid direction.The movie is a bit too long,and it drags in spots.But it's good family fun."
5,Little Women,"My mother made comments that she had seen this movie when she was in high school and would like to have it. I did a search on your sight and found it. Thank you.Sincerly,Peggy Parker"
2,Buy the 1994 version instead,I bought this version after I saw the 1994 version and was disappointed this one. I found out much later that his version didn't always stick to the script as the 1994 version does. Go with the newer 1994 version instead.
5,Little Women review,"I loved to watch this movie when I was home sick from school. And now that I'm working, it's still my favorite. I've seen the 1933 movei with Katherine Hepburn, which is good, but not the same. I haven't seen the Winona Ryder movie, so I can't compare that one."
2,Not bad... but,"I love the cast. June Allyson is perfect Jo and Magaret O'brien is simply touching. But unlike the cast, the movie is not that believable. I agree with Maltin. It is too glossy! MGM art team made the March family another Rockefellers! They didn't read the book. I'm sure."
1,"SEE THE 1933 OR 1994 VERSION, NOT THIS.","AFTER WATCHING THE 1994 VERSION STARRING WINONA RYDER, I HAD A HARD TIME WATCHING THIS ONE. THE ONLY REASON I BOTHERED IS BECAUSE THE 94 VERSION WAS SO GREAT. I THOUGHT THIS ONE MIGHT BE GOOD. SORRY BUT YOU CAN'T EVEN COMPARE'M. SO WHAT AM I DOING? BYE."
5,"A young and little Elizabeth Taylor , what a joy.","I did not see the other Little Women adaptations , and I can't imagine I will after seeing this perfect movie. What for? I always knew about the book but only recently came across the movie because I was interested in seeing movies with Elizabeth Taylor now that she has passed on. Just amazing, she was perfect at such a young age as an actress then that she certainly lived up to her reputation as the last of the old time greats. All in all, the movie was of a time and age that in my mind was make believe , after all the country was in a bloody war for everyone to be so nice to each other. Yet they were far removed from the front. The other actors were very good, but Elizabeth Taylor shone even at that age. Funny how Elizabeth Taylor and Janet Leigh married men different from the characters in the movie."
5,Little Women,"This dvd is a favourite of mine and now my daughter's as I have introduced the wonderful world of little women to her. She is 7 yrs old. For anyone who enjoys the love of family and the romance of young love, I would recommend this version of the movie Little Women."
4,Exceeded expectations,"I didn't expect much from this movie. Although I like old Hollywood movies, the acting is pretty bad usually. I thought this cast did a good job however. They all did a good job of portraying their characters without looking sappy or fake. I didn't recognize Elizabeth Taylor at first, but it was so nice to see her do something so different from some of her other roles. It was easy to root for all of them and feel uplifted that they all were happy in the end."
5,Wonderful family entertainment; Lawford is amazing.,"Little Women, starring June Allyson, is a lively, spirited version of a drab novel which never failed to put me to sleep as a child. This film was poignant,cheerful,sad,gay, and real. Peter Lawford, as Laurie, is a great leading man and was seriously underappreciated during his lifetime. I highly reccommend t his film to any age viewers."
2,"Right title, wrong movie","The movie arrived in good condition and quickly. The only problem was, I had ordered the older version of the movie (1949), not the 1994 version."
3,"noble try, but those mgm colors are too damn rich","june allyson tries so hard here to establish herself as a serious actress, but taking on a role where you are going to be compared to katharine hepburn is never wise. that being said, i found this mgm color gala to be not as bad as i had been led to believe, much as i found the 1933 cukor version to be not as good as it is supposed to be; i like both movies, but neither is a classic -- maybe its just the inherent thinness of the source."
5,Q Quality,Quincy Jones Has a Way With Music Like Few Others Before Or Since.this Set Showcases His Vision On The Big&Small Screen.He Feels The Music&it reflects The Settings Really Well.Having a Vision Such as this is a Special Gift.He is The Greatest Music Producer Ever&His Work is Timeless.This Set Reflects that Genius&More.
3,disappointed,"While it's got some great recipes, I really want her famous chocolate chip pie I used to buy at her NYC bake shop and it isn't in it. But I'll try some other recipes that sound interesting. Someone recommended her chocolate chip cookies to me and that recipe is in the book."
3,Limited,"I collect cookbooks, so I couldn't pass this up. It's short, but my reason for purchasing was every recipe must be really good. I think I made one recipe so far, and it was good. Nice pictures. Quite specialized, not for a general, all-in-one go to kind of sweet book."
1,chocolate chip cookie recipe off the bag,"I'm 43 and remember making this identical chocolate chip cookie recipe which was then listed on the bag of Hershey's chocolate chips. I just checked and the recipe currently on the bag is different. With this reputation and a foreword from Ina Garten saying ""Make the chocolate chip cookies"" I'd expect an original recipe."
3,Don't Expect Bakery Quality Treats,"Having had the delicious chocolate chip cookies from Tate's Bake Shop, I was thrilled to finally have the recipe! As soon as I recieved the book I made the cookies. Let me tell you, they are OK, but taste nothing like the cookies from the bakery.Also, some ingredients are clearly left out of some of the recipes (ex pecan cookies don't list pecans as one of the ingredients).I am giving 3 stars in the hopes that some of the other recipes fair better than the cookies."
1,Don't Bother with this one!,"You would think that while Ina Garten was writing the forward for her friend Kathleen's book she would have double checked the recipes to make sure they work. Where are the pecans in the pecan cookie recipe? I'm sure Ina knows how valuable photos are in cook books, hers are filled with beauties - there are none here. With so many baking books out there, in today's economy don't waste your time or money on this one. Very disappointing!"
3,Adequate,"It's only fair to say my review is colored by the fact I am trying to pare down my cookbook collection to as few essentials as possible. With that said, there are plenty of good recipes in this book. However, both Dorie Greenspan & Maida Heatter's books have more to offer. Not bad, just not the best. Try borrowing it from your library 1st."
3,Ehhh it's ok.,"I was VERY excited to get this book, I love I.Garten and because her baking recipes have been sooo good I figured that if she was singing the praises of this book, then it would definately be something special...unfortunately, it's really not. Which was a serious disappointment.I have tried several of the recipes and not even once did we have one of those ""OMG these are to die for!"" moment?!This is a good book for new bakers but for people who know anything about baking it will probably be wasted space on the shelf. Sorry Kathy...I really did want to love this cookbook, but I bought it anyhow and that'll be a few extra bucks in your pocket. :)"
5,Easy & Beyond Tasty,"Tate's Bakeshop is one of my favorites, so I was happy to get this book as a gift. I've tried a few recipes and all have been easy and beyond tasty. The chocolate cupcakes with peanut butter frosting are one of the best desserts I've ever had. Carrot cake and the signature chocolate chip cookies are first rate."
5,Everything in this book is awesome!,I've enjoyed Tate's items for years and was so excited to get this cookbook! I regularly make the chocolate chip cookies and the lemon bars - but everything in the book is awesome!
5,GOD AND THE LAW OF RELATIVITY,"I CAN NOT THINK OF THE WORDS TO EXPRESS HOW WONDERFUL THIS BOOK IS AND ALL THE OTHER BOOKS BY BEN AMMI. BEN AMMI HAS EFFECTED MORE LIVES ON THIS PLANET THEN ANY OTHER BEING OF THIS TIME. I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR TAKING THE TIME TO CHANGE MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER. AND I HOPE THAT EVERYONE WHO READS THIS BOOK WILL AGREE WITH ME. OTHER BOOKS BY BEN AMMI ARE ""GOD THE BLACK MAN AND THE TRUTH"" ""EVERLASTING LIFE"" ""MESSIAH AND THE END OF THE WORLD""MAY YAHWA BLESS ALL OF YOU SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT AND BE GUIDED BY IT AND IN THIS CASE BEN AMMI IS THE LIGHT."
2,GUESS IT WAS ALL WASHED AWAY,"Perhaps this fragrance is aptly named as the ""Rain"" seems to have washed all the fragrance away.Despite a number of ""Spritzs"" there is absolutely no scent.Sorry to say."
1,rubbish,"I like Kalahari Surfers very much, but this one is big disappointment. I bought this one here at Amazon.com, and expected something like Akasic record or Muti media, but this is nothing like that. Panga management can offer to you only boring dub rhythms, still repeating endlesly in one line without any musical links. Do not waste your money!"
4,"A fast, funny read","In a nutshell, Shark River is a faster, easier read than some of RWW's other books, in large part because the humor factor has never been higher. Doc Ford's buddy, Tomlinson, is much easier to take when he's worrying about his manhood than when he's stirring up revolution in Cuba (""North of Havana""). And ""Shark River"" is MUCH better than the dark, depressing ""Mangrove Coast.""I would've given the book 5 stars, but it seemed as though the ending was slow to arrive and then wrapped up a little too quickly and cleanly. Nice little twist at the end in RWW's traditional ""Guess Which Woman"" epilogue.Highly recommended."
5,What a great book.,As good as any RWW book. Only problem is that I go through them so fast that it seems to take to long for the next one to come out.
2,Everybody does South Florida - some better than others,"Randy White's ""Shark River"" never succeeds in being more than a rather tedious -- albeit knowledgeable -- marine travelog of South Florida. The elements of action/thriller are weak and hardly more than an afterthought. Everybody loves South Florida overcooked at the hands of Dorsey, Hiaasen, and Barry; Randy White is no threat whatsoever to that highly competitive niche."
3,more of a southwest Florida travelogue than a crime novel,"'Shark River' is one of those perfectly amiable comic crime novels set in Florida. Carl Hiaasen is the master of the trade, Randy Wayne White is a mere wannabe ... judging by this book. Oh, 'Shark River' is a pleasant read; the pages just float on by. But the author seemed to be wrapped up in describing southwest Florida's flora and fauna than providing the reader with a decent mystery. And so this book will be quickly forgotten by this reader.As for the story, well we have Doc Ford once again fighting off nasty drug dealers. He also discovered he has a sister/cousin, a rowdy Bahamian woman who creates both attention and trouble. Throw in some wacky characters and a little treasure-hunting and you have ... again, a pleasant yet forgettable read.Bottom line: probably not worth the bother. Try any of Carl Hiaasen's books instead."
3,"Not great, not bad either","I guess my problem is that I really don't like the Doc Ford character. He's stuck-up and judgmental. I much prefer Tomlinson, but then I liked Meyer better than I liked Travis McGee. Doc Ford -- White -- is certainly a brain, and you can learn a heck of a lot reading these books. This is my second Doc Ford novel, I read Mangrove Coast and I think I liked it better. Don't get me wrong. I'd love to write books as good as White's, but he just doesn't rsonate with me the way Jim Hall's books about Thorn do, or even Ed McBain's Matthew Hope series. The story was OK, in fact it was very Travis McGee in the way Doc Ford sets up his bad guys and takes them out. I thought the subplot about the two spatting lovers that Doc Ford re-unites was almost superfluous, added in to make the book longer. So all in all, not great but not too bad either. I think White could have made one point a little more forcefully...we're ALL swimming in a river of sharks, the world."
4,Crackling with Suspense,"Rich atmosphere, populated with engaging characters, the latest Doc Ford novel is well-written, complex and an entertaining thriller. Shark River introduces an attractive mulatto woman who claims to be Ford's sister, in search of a legacy left to her by her (their?) ne'er-do-well father."
4,Not His Best,"I've enjoyed all of Randy White's books--this was not his best, but still entertaining for light reading. The plot was a bit weak, but his characters are always interesting and well described."
4,Shark River,"Being from Florida, I enjoyed reading about places that are familar and some that were not. I like the way Mr. White writes, subject is interesting and just enough action to keep you anxious to see what will happen. I like the characters in this book, good blend of personalities."
5,Great spanish prog-metal,"I have been searching for a good spanish prog band forever. Music like this is hard to find, but I'm glad that I finally found this CD. Since purchasing it, I've checked out other albums by Avalanch, and have found them very enjoyable as well.Even if you don't speak spanish, this music is open and accessible, and great prog metal. My personal favorite songs are Cien veces, Del cielo a la tierra, and the title track is probably the very best one, Los poetas han muerto.This is really splendid music. If you like bands like Symphony X, Iced Earth, or other good metal bands, check these guys out."
1,Moral Child: Nurturing Children's Natural Moral Growth,"The book made it to me in fine condition.However, I had trouble staying awake throughout the reading. I found the material to be rather redundant and unhelpful as to the conclusion and steps to take thereafter. I had to read this bok for a college class and do not recommend it for anyone."
2,disappointing,I've seen other translations that keep the focus on Shonogon's lists. Waley stays true to the convention that the pillow-book is a young girl's diary and it reads as such (yawn) I wish I'd researched the other translations before dropping the money on this one.
3,Does the job for $4,"Not the sturdiest product, I wouldn't crack the eggs on the egg separator but it does the job. It has a little extension opposite the handle, but it's basically useless unless you're sitting it on top of a cup. Does the job though, I don't know where the get away with saying it retails for 19.99. If you paid 19.99 for it please contact me because I have a Louis vittillon hand bag from canal street and it's yours for $100"
2,Not easy at all,"I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and have spent the entire day trying to get some music videos to load and play correctly on it. They require as special format of WMV (which it does not say on the box.) The documentation is VERY poor and so is the support info on their web site.I would not purchase this for running downloaded video. I guess if you only use the special Mix-max cards it would be ok, but converting your standard music videos for this is a pain! I still haven't figured it out and I have a feeling they have a bug. I have to call support after Christmas.I expected more of a Disney product."
1,If this is the way Disney treats customers they don't deserve any !!!,"I thought I was a bit savy about codecs and windows media player10 plugins but this Media Player made by Memorex for Disney will humble you. A nice package with good buttons and now after 3 hrs of reading and $10 phone call to tech support (hung up once by Duane1031 and completely untechnical Rachel041 I'm supposed to get an email sometime.All the nice packageing and big screen doesn't help if the you can't use it. If this is the way Disney treats customers, they don't deserve to have any."
4,MixMax by Disney - High School Musical,"Bought this for my 7 year old who loves music and it was a BIG hit. It shows the song title as well as album info exactly like a more expensive Mp3 player. The resolution is good for the price. The housing although is cheap plastic, doesn't feel so strong but no problems as of yet. Prices vary greatly, but as of March 2007, one shouldn't pay above [...] tops for this model. It is adorable and all the little girls are crazy about HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL! I can recommend positively."
1,Not Kid or Parent friendly,"We bought this as a Christmas present and one month later I am still trying to download video. Customer service calls were a waste of time. I asked how I could upload kid friendly videos in wmv format and his reply was, ""how should I know"". For a Disney product, you would think it would be more user friendly. Don't waste your time unless you want to use the video clips only. I am giving up and returning it."
5,Better in French than not at all,"Unfortunately, there is no available edition of Bandello's 16th century novelle in English. Since I don't read Italian, I opted for this version, which is serviceable if you are in the same situation."
4,"For a local history book, it's a respectable effort.","As anyone who has ever tried to track down books on Syracuse's history can tell you, they are few and far between. Mostly, they look like something your 8th grade history teacher photocopied and stapled together. This is a professional effort; the description above mentions that some of the photos are of ""indifferent"" quaility. Obviously they had never seen previous efforts. This is a nice little book with lots of cool little remembered facts that have been buried by Syracuse's present state of dispare. If you're interested in Syracuse's history, you could do much worse. I personally like this book a lot."
5,Very very good!,I seriously think this is a great book. It is the only really Syracuse tour book I know. And it has a lot of history. Buy it now!
4,Washington by Design,"This is a wonderful book that highlights all the most important buildings in the District. It gives a short synopsis on each buiding highlighted, some like the Capitol and the White House getting a bit more coverage. It was quite comprehensive, and the buildings covered came with pictures. It is not up to the level of the AIA Guide to Detriot or New York, but it is a nice guide none the less. I definitly recommend it to anyone interested in the architecture of the District."
1,An unpleasant listening experience,"I agree with the ""monkey in the cathedral"" reviewer. This music is uninteresting, unenjoyable, not tuneful in any way. I got no pleasure at all out of this CD and consider it a waste of money."
1,Is there a monkey loose in the cathedral?,"Is this a recording of a primate or small child just banging on a pipe organ? I understand and even appreciate the use of dissonance in music, but come on - that's all these ""songs"" are. It reminded me of a psych patient taking out their agressions on an instrument. I only gave it one star because that was the lowest rating allowed!If listening to the samples offered doesn't set you on edge like fingernails on a chalkboard, you may want to have your hearing checked. Listen before you buy and save yourself some bucks and a serious mistake."
3,Needs more information,"This book was very detailed and had a lot of great information in it. It's clear that Mr. Macpherson has spent a lot of time in Canada and that he is well versed in the Provincial Park system. However, the great flaw with this book is surprisingly obvious... there are no maps!Though he colors in areas such as ""Northern Ontario"" and ""Eastern Ontario"" on a large blank map, he does not mark where the parks are within that region, which meant I had to hop on Google and look up the location of each park... something I was hoping to avoid.If you're looking for a great book on hiking in Ontario, I recommend ""Hiking Ontario's Heartland"" by Shirley Teasdale instead."
5,Buy this or you'll be sorry!,"Allen MacPherson is a genius. This book is a must have for anyone who enjoys the outdoors and trails. He is a great professor, and proves himself with this book. Check out his other book. It is definetly worth reading, too. Do not hesitate to pick this up!!"
3,Beautifully designed case...,"and after hearing her (Mira Bollete)s Dylan cover 'As I went out one Morning' and 'The Light'-I was suitably impressed enough to buy this. 'Morning' is a 5 star performance, but upon listening to DRMA, I was kind of let down-she has a very interesting voice and vocalese, but this is way too minimal and homoginized for me at least-and I wanted to like this record.Her(?) 2 fingered plonking on the piano, while done well, gets tiring.Can she play the piano or not?I kept wanting the music to break out of its rut into something, but it never does.The arrangements are kind of uninspired.If SONY has their claws on her-for the Dylan movie OST-or if she stays on DC, maybe she will expand her repertoire-I think she has it in her."
1,Where's the funny?,"I got this cd for a long drive, hoping to be amused in the car. It's the most un-funny thing I've ever heard. Dan and his wife are a one-trick pony. Talk radio hosts can be over the top, but why waste several cuts on the same thing? I'll save you some money - the one funny line comes from Dan playing a real loser, responding to a life coach who asks, ""What are you strengths?"" (Pause) ""I know my weaknesses."" That's it. No more funny.Castellaneta should thank his lucky stars for the brilliant writers on The Simpsons. He may sound good, but they make him funny."
4,"Dan, Dan, he's our man!","This is labeled as a Dan Castellaneta album, but it's really a Dan Castellaneta and Deb Lacusta album (other than the one musical cut). I guess her name got left off the album cover because they figured nobody ever heard of her (I know I didn't). Dan and Deb do sketch comedy in the Nichols and May tradition. They aren't quite as funny as Nichols and May, but they do have their moments. The final track here features Dan as Homer performing a song in the style of thePet Sounds/Smileera Beach Boys. It's very funny, and will be the track of the most interest to Simpsons fans. I guess I should explain the album title, for those of you who don't get it. It's a takeoff of Leonard Nimoy's book titleI Am Not Spock. See, Dan is even making the Vulcan ""live long and prosper"" hand gesture on the cover. Yes, I'm a geek for knowing that."
1,Not all it's cracked up to be.,"I was very disappointed in this cd. I expected Dan to be on his A game and deliver some very funny material. I expected him to be as funny, if not funnier, than Homer Simpson. Goes to show that comedy is in the hands of the writers. Dan has a few good moments, but they are few and far between. I was very turned off by his wife. She was even less funny than he was. This husband and wife comedy act would be booed off stage in a new york minute. Don't waste your time buying this. Stick to watching the Simpsons to get your fill. The only thing worth listening to on the album is the last track when Dan gets into his Simpson characters."
2,"...Nor are you funny, sorry","Dan is a vocal talent, but not a particularly funny one. Sketches meander, go nowhere and fail to amuse in the journey. Sorry Dan, get some good writers and try again. Funniest thing is the Leonard Nimoy reference in the title and cover photo."
1,mostly nothing,"Im new to the whole noise as music concept, but i have grown to appreciate a well constructed collage of sound, just as i've learnt that every entire musical genre has moments of truth and integrity...There are a few intruiging moments on the textures throughout this hollow album but for the most part we are looking at the controled experiments of tempo and static and not really rising above that, other albums by the artist engage in their subtleties more effectively then the controlled experiement of this cold sound in a vacuum."
5,This CD is great...,"Simply put, this CD is awesome. Kevin Ridel is a great vocalist and the bandmates fit together great. RADIOACTIVE is 13 tracks of great emotional music. This is a definite buy for fans of Weezer."
5,A real rocker,"""Radioactive"" is the major label debut of AM Radio. While the album doesn't exactly capture the excitement of their live performances, the new interpretations of fan favorites are definitely rewarding. Great hooks (""Hush""), pop classics (""Take Time""), and all-out American rock (""Taken For A Ride"") are all found on this fantastic album. Check them out!"
4,Prayer of Jabez in Spanish,"This album is also available in Spanish from Forefront Records under the title: La Oracion de Jabes. Una experiencia de Adoracion. Canciones originales inspiradas en el libro 'La Oracion De Jabes,' creado en sociedad con Multnomah Publishers y Bruce Wilkinson."
2,Merely a list of mathematical subjects one should know,"This book is simply a list of mathematical subjects one should have a working knowledge of for physics. It should not be advertised as anything more than that, since it can not claim to sufficiently teach any of these subjects. The examples are simplistic, and will not help you when working problems in this book. If you are required to get this book for a course, then look at the syllabus for your course to find out what math books you'll need to find."
2,you can judge this one by its cover,"With a cover slightly sturdier than newsprint, and binding that seems like it's held with Elmer's GlueStik, M&W is a text you can probably skip with no remorse. I can see it having one target audience: If you already have more than a working knowledge of advanced mathematics, M&W should be good for a reminder on specific topics. If you're a grad student preparing to take a class on this subject, then you're in trouble. M&W, while covering a number of subjects, does not go into any of them in sufficient detail to understand the concepts or complete anything beyond the simplest of problems. Their examples are sparse and poorly explained. Out of a class of 50, I don't know of any that found M&W to be of any use (other than the professor, that is)."
5,"For decades, still the best dog training book!","Got this book decades ago (late 60's) after we purchased an expensive 6 months old German Shepherd from Germany. When she came out of her crate snarling, my husband obtained this book from the public library. We had wanted a good protection dog, but also had a baby and toddler. After training with Mr. Koehler's method, this dog won top awards at many obedience shows, and became a most protective and SAFE dog around our children. Recently bought this for a niece who rescued a hyper, very assertive pit bull ... Mr. Koehler's principles are timeless and will work for any breed."
1,Verdi would be rolling over in his grave...,"Turning one of the most beautiful, affecting choruses (a cry by Hebrew slaves for freedom!) in the whole repertoire into banal adult-contemporary music has to be one of the worst decisions ever made! Sinead's beautiful voice attempts to reinstill some of the haunting quality of the original, but Zucchero sounds like Bryan Adams on a bad day and the music is Simply-Red lite. Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate crossover revisions of quality. Ferry Corsten's remix of Barber's Adagio for Strings was one, and so was William Orbit's ""Pieces in A Modern Style.""If you're a dentist or psychiatrist, consider picking this up for your waiting room. It'll fit right in."
2,Review of Discrete Mathematics (4th Edition),I used this book for a sophomore level Discrete Math class in the CS program at Park university. It was pretty difficult to understand for everybody in the class including myself and I've had math through Calc III. It was apparently not written for that level student.
4,Smart text,"There are plenty of house books worth a quick scan, but this is one worth hanging on to. That is, if you're interested in ultra modern architect designed houses. The competition is The New American House series, which is mostly pictures, and the Taunton Press books, which unfortunately add insipid text. What makes this book stand out is its excellent design, and plans, sections and elevations for every entry. Something that could only have been gotten from access to the original construction documents. There's a companion essay for each house. True, it's ultimately nonsense, but it's well considered and articulate nonsense, as the author, a former architectural magazine editor, knows his history."
3,a well researched book,"This book mainly deals with residential properties & most of them have already been featured in other architectural books. In my opinion, this book works because it doesn't concentrate simply on properties in the States as many architecture books tend to do. Rather, it gives us a broader picture by illustrating properties from all around the world. Whilst the books are divided into various categories as discussed in the editorial review, I particularly enjoy the discussion on properties that fall either in abstract (clarity in design) category or representative (to conform with their surroundings) category. Whilst there are cross section diagrams of properties, labelling would enhance our understanding of the application of architecture on properties mentioned. Otherwise, the discussion could be overbearing or technical at times. Still, I'm finding this book to be an enjoyable read."
5,first meeting,"this was the first really exposure that i had with him and his touch on the saxophone with most all of the songs that were among my favorites. his touch,beat and arrangement were all suberb and turned me solidly into one of his fans.I had heard some of his tunes on the radio and knew of him but had never really listened to his talent and touch.Thus now I'm going to be on the look out for more of his music as I can sit back and relax to his playing the top tunes of yesterday."
5,Gold Standard,"This CD is as good as any session this band has previously recorded, save possibly Times Square. It is fresh, compelling, and full of great musicianship. And Elvis Costello's ""Beautiful Lady"" is perfect: not too much EC but a fine add. If you like this band, add this one to the collection with little hesitation."
4,Excellent Band,"Of the three MBB CDs I own, this one is my least favorite. However, note that I gave it four stars so it is still a very fine album. Eclipse is the best thing on this CD, Black Saint & Sinner Lady is awfully good and Sweet Sucker Dance is lovely; but Elvis Costello's contributions on Invisible Lady just didn't do it for me. Sorry, Elvis, I love you but.... I call this a valiant effort but (sadly) a miss. Frank Lacy's vocal on Devil Woman did not do much for me either.I really wanted to give this one five stars, but it seemed to me there was something missing, despite some excellent moments and - as usual - top notch musicianship."
3,"Not the master, but a heck of a good shadow of him","I was actually looking for an old Rasaan Roland Kirk/Charles Mingus collaboration of the same name, so I was disappointed at first to get this CD by the modern day Mingus orchestra. But, they play the old great tunes with integrity, and ideas, and soul."
4,Plateau Breaker,"This album broke new ground with me. I thought I knew jazz until I heard this. In this album we have new instruments (not used in jazz much), all kinds of timing variations and what I think is a great recording. You will not be sorry if you purchase this."
4,Improving...,"I have to admit that I wasn't impressed at all by 'I feel lonely', but then I heard this song. It's hard to believe it's sung by the same person. thankfully none of his songs released since then have been as bad as 'I feel lonely'"
5,Pere Ubu at its most improvisatory,"This is the original line-up of Pere Ubu at its most improvisatory, nearly every song clearly built up spontaneously in the studio around some core musical idea. David Thomas riffing on words (""Dishes! dishes! dishes! All for love of you....""), Maimone's killer bass lines, Herman and Ravenstine working it out in the best free-jazz tradition. Although it isn't jazz at all. And then all the mounting but masterfully controlled tension is released with ""Jehovah's Kingdom Come"", Thomas' most beautiful pop song until the Cloudland album a decade later and the album's only truly ""composed"" piece. New Picnic Time falls almost unnoticed between more rock and blues-oriented masterworks like Modern Dance and Dub Housing, on the one hand, and the more self-consciously arty Art of Walking and Song of the Bailing Man, on the other. But it stands as Pere Ubu's singularly greatest work in this first period of their career. An incredible masterpiece."
2,All Downhill From Here - Blame Thomas and Thompson,"At one point in history, Pere Ubu threatened to be one of the greatest rock groups this planet has ever seen or heard - avant garde yet accessible, uncompromising yet listenable. Then David Thomas took over the reins and drove them up the nearest cul de sac. So instead of being the Sex Pistols of the avant garde, they became the Henry Cow of punk rock - some achievement! This album is where it all began to go off the rails, or more accurately into a overgrown, moss-covered siding called ""art rock"". Worse was to come when Mayo Thompson replaced the brilliant Tom Herman (whatever happened to....), Thompson being a thoroughgoing obscurantist, heroically dedicated to musically disappearing up his own hindquarters. Stick to ""Modern Dance"", ""Dub Housing"", ""Datapanik"" - remember them THAT way."
2,Much better books available,"When I started working in Radiation Therapy, somebody recommended this book to me to learn the theoretical aspects. I am also required to teach a resident lecture out of this book. The more I use it, the less I like it. While the book may contain information on all basic and necessary topics, the way they are presented is less than optimal.I find the writing style is not conducive to learning. The author has the annoying habit to insert sentences hinting at advanced topics without really explaining what it means. For the reader not familiar with the advanced topics, those remarks just create confusion. Some of the chapters, especially on electrons, are very unorganized and jump back and forth.Compared to other excellent works available, e.g. Hendee and Ibbott, or Jayaraman and Lanzl, this book is much weaker in quality/price."
2,Not too clear,"Even though this is supposed to be the gold std for rad onc physics, it's not a particularly good one for teaching. It's mildly out of date and the writing style is, well, frustrating to read. Like another reader pointed out, the author makes random references to this and that w/o further explanation. Unfortunately, b/c this text is the std, it's become a necessity. So try to borrow someone else's copy for the boards, cause you won't be using this book on a daily basis, that's for sure."
1,someone please come up with something else!,"Worthless for anyone without a degree in Physics. Since it's being used to teach Radiation Therapists, can someone please come up with a better alternative? The lack of units in equations makes it impossible for a lower level student to learn from it."
4,what is wrong with people?,"O.K. folks, just 'cause y'all are gettin' caught up in Strokes and White Stripes mania don't mean ya' gotta put The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion down! The ever trendy rock media and the wanna- be hipsters are cryin' out for the heads of The Blues Explosion over this record 'cause it is a little TOO rock'n'roll for their lame ears! So what if it ain't the greatest JSBX record ever? This record is still 1000 times better than what has been passing for ""garage"" or ""broken blues"" or what ever the heck people are callin' these new ""bowl-cut"" bands! Come on folks, we owe these guys."
5,"Jon, Judah, & Russell: Rockin' Your Rear End","...Cripes if this aint a rock n roll record. Talk about some serious [behind]-funkin' music. Good-time, dirty, mean stuff is what I'm saying. Get it, Learn it, Live it, Love it, and Believe it."
5,One of the year's best rock albums!,"Blues Explosion have really fulfilled their potential with this album. Every song from beginning to end is terrific, unlike past albums which were more inconsistent. Plastic Fang is just a great rock and roll album, JSBX are confident and poised, and with good reason. If you like pure, high energy rock and roll, you won't regret picking this album up."
1,Elementary Spanish Video Review,"I was not impressed with this video at all. I bought it for my 4 year old and it was extremely boring for him. It mostly shows a woman saying Spanish words (with minimal poor animation thrown in). As the words are said, they are not shown on the screen which makes it difficult for a visual learner."
5,Currency ID manual,This book along with occasional use of the WEB has enabled me to identify currency from countries that not only do not use english style letters but the number systems as well. The text has both some color and a lot of black and white photos of currency along with a brief description of what the note is called. The pictures enable positive ID of a piece of Cucurrency. The book is a must have for the serious collector.
4,A book for Professional Numismatist,"this book is great in term for those who very very interested in world currency and pro in this field... it may be good to own a copy of this book cause it include a lot of world money that you and me were not born yet... especially note that impress me is the CHINA's CENTURY ... it is like amazing to see those kind of note that never thought of it would be called as ""money""...anywhere this book is great... and if this book improving its' note with color than it is highly recommended...thank you...regards,Jason Yap"
3,Wasn't for me,The stitching on the kris kross over the chest came out so it was loose in places. I couldn't tell that it made much of a difference.
5,GREAT!!,THE PRODUCT ARRIVED EARLIER THAN EXPECTED AND WAS UN GOOD AND WORKING CONDITION AS STATED AT PURCHASE. I HAVE NOT HAD ANT ISSUES WITH THE CD AND AM A VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER.
4,Excellent choice,"Hi, My name is@Hiromi and I just moved to the US this July@from Japan. Now I study English with this book. This book is good for me because:1.@It is very easy to understand.2. It is a very good level for me.3.@The pages are colorful and fun to read.As you can see, I highly recommend this book to you."
4,"Side by Side: Student Book 1, Third Edition","Excellent book for beginning English students. The material is presented logically, leads to great discussion topics and is useful for real life encounters."
2,Bane of My Existance,"I taught from Side By Side for two years while living in Japan and intensely disliked it. I found the dialouges extremely moronic and unrealistic. Endless repitition and substitution drills are really no way to learn English. Furthermore, the first unit, in which students are complete beginners, contains 1. a reference to Social Security Numbers and 2. introduces the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Students at this level are still trying to cope with English letters and sounds; it is unfair to throw a cultural reference at them so early on. The inclusion of San Juan--with Spanish, not English pronunication--is really inexcusable."
4,Solid,Purchased this among others to help my mom with her ESL classes. I used the same material about 20 y ago. It helps her as it helped me.
4,"Side by Side: Student Book 1, Third Edition","My wife has recently come from China and this is the book her english class uses. Though in Miami, FL they are in english-spanish mostly. She finds it interesting and easy to use and I go over her daily lessons with her and find it a very useful tool in learning chinese also. I would certainly recommend that any students learning english look into buying this book."
1,A textbook that rates a C minus,"As an ESL teacher, I have found this heavily-promoted book very disappointing. Some of its many deficiencies: (1)overuse of proper names, which are difficult for students and distract them from the substance; (2) overuse of vocabulary irrelevant to the lives of urban adult immigrants (skiing, skating, working in the yard, drinking lemonade, vacationing in Paris); (3) stilted and artificial reading selections; (4) sketches depicting dated fashions or artifacts (bell-bottom jeans, large Afro hairdos, record players, dial telephones); (5) introduction of common errors in grammar or word meaning without identifying them as errors (""how come?"" as an alternative to ""why?""; ""nauseous"" in a context that requires ""nauseated""--actually I think that example may be from Book 2, but I have the same criticisms of all four books in this series.)"
4,A good first step for English learners with previous knowledge.,"This book would be too tough for absolute beginners of English, but an excellent aid for anyone who has prior knowledge and usage of English. Sentence structure exercises are excellent sources for quizes too. I recommend this book without many reservations."
4,Good book,I like it I buy it because I was wondering the book has a CD for listening but is a good book.
4,Side by Side Teachers Guide,The book took a little longer to arrive than I expected but it arrived in good condition.
4,Great Method,"It's not the perfect method, but it's better than most. I love that almost every new vocabulary has images, it is easier to explain. The formulas are very simple and the drills are excellent but sometimes too repetitive. Overall it gets the job done in a very simple easy to use manner. Side by side in my opinion is one of the best English learning methods."
5,Excellent book,"The ""Side By Side"" series is a very good, conversation-based way to learn English.I am using Book 4 with a learner from China who has mastered basic reading and conversation and needs to expand her vocabulary and practice verb tenses. The book is filled with helpful lessons designed to have a student and tutor talking (and laughing) in no time. It uses current language including many idioms and tasteful slang expressions. The dialogs are set in real, useful situations and colorful, humorous illustrations make learning fun.Highly recommended for use with adults who can read well but need work on advanced verb tenses and new vocabulary."
2,"Hokey, Crappy photos","This book is great for a guide that takes you 3/4 of the way through the second season, but any fan could have written it. The front cover is also pretty packaging... Inside doesn't look like much. There are few images, and few insights."
5,more than 5 stars...,"This masterpiece is the continuation of ATL's work. Always better and better, always more subtle, always more funky, I can't wait for the next: Diary of a drug dealer..."
2,Their Worst Album.,"I am a HUGE ATL Fan. Black Mafia 4 Life, know what I mean. I waited a long time for this release, and it was painful to listen to. It just seemed to lack direction. It might be said that this album (an independent record label) was so bad, that it ended their careers. Too bad, I loved ATL."
3,So so,"I found the information to be more scientific than what I was looking for. I also found it to be too much against parenting with boundaries. Attachment parenting is oft misunderstood. Indeed, most parents who think they are attachment parenting are creating attachment issues for their children by fretting over the attachment and being afraid to let the child go. A child will flourish with a strong, healthy - let me repeat - healthy attachment."
3,Reads like a high school biology book,"Based on others' reviews, I was hoping for a more nuanced, in depth review of the scientific literature with regard to early childhood development and the role that we play as parents. For anyone who has already read a few parenting guides, however, this book was more like a high level overview of the same principles. The information about different levels of brain function is important, and the treatment of that subject was well done. But there's a lot of fluff and repetition here.For those who haven't read much parenting literature, this would be a good user-friendly introduction. But for those looking for more scientific details to inform your parenting, a la Annie Murphy Paul's ""Origins,"" this book will disappoint."
5,Best SM I've ever read,"From the first page to the last, this is the best thing I have ever read in SM (and I should know, I've read all the best). It never lets up and the sex is just great. What a heroine Deborah is! And what she has to suffer! It's just a great read. Read this and follow it up with another one of Rochelle's books. You'll love them. I promise you it will keep you going all the way."
4,Nice quality,"Nice quality, but as usual, the chain is rather skimpy. But for the price, I would expect this. Nice detail."
4,Frankenstein is the best,"this dvd is one of the best. although some are lip-sync jobs, such as Alice Cooper, Roxy Music and a few others are suspect. Lynyrd Skynrd's never ending performance of Free Bird is somewhat lethargic. but the highlights outweigh the bad. these are Rory Gallagher, Captain Beefheart, Tom Waits, Bill Withers, Ramones (Joey has a double tracked vocal, hmmm), and Edgar Winter Group's unbelievable performance of Frankenstein. the sound and picture quality are spectacular on this dvd, well worth picking up."
1,You've Been Warned - Don't Do it....!,"This is the ""Americanized"" single DVD release of the great UK 2-Disc Set of OGWT classic performances. I'm not surprised, but for some reason they have decided to ditch incredible performances from artists like The New York Dolls, Meatloaf , Public Image, Gary Numan & Alex Harvey as well as some interesting oddities like Focus, Japan, Robert Wyatt, Teardrop Explodes & Tim Buckley. They have however chosen to include Randy Newman & Bonnie Raitt. Go Figure. Do yourself a favor & seek out the REGION ZERO release of the UK version & enjoy the entire spectrum of great music that it offers. Did I mention Randy Newman....?"
3,Wait for Volume Three,"For some reason a search on Amazon of ""Old Grey Whistle Test"" only comes up with this initial DVD. Although very good, there have been two other releases of the show since then.DVD's 2 & 3 are single disc formats with the latter being by far and away the best of all three. I initially bought the DVD primarily for 2 songs.... John Martyn's ""Couldn't love you more"" (with Danny Thompson on bass) and a 23yo Jackson Browne singing ""Jamaica say you will"" from his first album. The absolute highlight however is Steve Marriott and Humble Pie doing a classic version of ""Black coffee"". If you buy the disc for no other reason, you won't have wasted your money."
5,Incredible Vintage Performances & Interviews,"Wow, this is an amazing disc!! I used to watch The Old Grey Whistle Test when I lived in London in the early 80's, so I was really excited to see this was going to be released 'across the pond.' If you've never heard of The Old Grey Whistle Test and you are a music fan, YOU NEED TO CHECK THIS OUT!!! John Lennon singing 'Stand By Me' plus a 17-minute interview with him. Elton John sitting alone at a piano singing 'Tiny Dancer'. Classic stuff!! Bruce Springsteen, U2, REM, too many truly amazing performances to list here. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves classic rock!"
3,"Audio Problems, Video Problems","I love the content, but when played in my laptop it freezes up sometimes and the disc just spins in the drive. That hasn't happened in my DVD player. Listening closely I can hear fluctuations in the audio quality - phasing from bass to treble and back, on some selections.The menu also lacks a song selection feature, you either have to play them in order or use 'random play'. I knew this when I bought it though and it isn't a big issue for me. The array of artists in their prime and the songs featured are fantastic."
5,A fantastic gay-mystery romp,"This is a fantastic gay mystery romp through the same territory that makes up the content of any basic episode of Law and Order or CSI. But it's told from a gay point of view, with two very likable actors playing a gay and lesbian pair of sleuths...AND it is so enjoyable you find yourself looking at the extras. Watch the short! It's hilarious!...This is one of those films that makes for a great after-dinner movie for your next gay or lesbian gathering -- but when it's over, you'll find yourselves making up your own gay suspense mystery. Now gather your friends, write a script, grab a camera, and try to film it yourself! It's that kind of film, You'll enjoy it, but you'll be inspired to think creatively yourself."
1,Simply awful...,"At best, this movie is a poorly crafted attempt to cash in on the emerging genre of gay noir. At worst, it is ham-fisted softcore porn. In either case, it's not very pretty. The acting is wooden, the script is BEYOND dumb, and the directing variously reminds me of digital home movies and slapdash film school projects. C'mon, guys. Just because you're shooting on zero-budget doesn't mean you have to create this lame unwatchable cinematic turd. If you want to see some gay noir made with no bucks that's actually worth watching, take a look at Tom Kalin's SWOON (1992)."
2,movies,"To whom it may conern,It was a good movie. But some moive senc where taken out. But other it is a good movie.Thank youPeter"
4,New Movie Genre,"In the best tradition of straightening freedoms of new millennium filmmakers tell of a lesbian detective working for a gay guy to solve a mysterious disappearance of his twin brother-photographer.Dialogues and lack of context have been filled with scenes of nudity and sexual activities making a viewer supposing that this is all in a world around.Nice music, easy watching plot, not too dirty visualisation.Perhaps, this work belongs to an oncoming genre of movies mixing variety of sexual activities for a general viewing."
2,gay light,"High school drama class combined with the football and pom pom squids would be the way I would describe the acting and plot development. Was hard for the movie to hold my interest even with the eye candy, can see that online anytime."
3,"Muster dialect Irish, and no text","I found this product to be useful, but you need to know 2 things that I did not prior to my buying it.1. It is the Munster dialect of Irish (one of the 3 primary dialects), and uses some words which not in the other 2 dialects(but are widely used in Munster Irish). The pronunciation of several other words are unique to Muster as well.2. There is NO TEXT WHATSOEVER. No transcript. Nothing but the 4 tapes. I contacted the publisher, and they told me that it is a violation of the Pimsleur method to provide any text whatsoever. Hmmm. Okay. If you say so.But I did like the style of going over the material again and again. Drilling the phrases. This process is lacking in the other Irish language products I have purchased. And I have purchased just about every one on the market."
2,"Good tapes, but a book would help","The tapes are clear, and easy to learn from, but only for those who learn easily by just listening. For those who, like me, learn better by seeing and hearing, the lack of a text is disappointing. The tapes are Munster Irish, not the standard language. As courses based on the living language - from any of the 3 main dialects - are becoming more popular, this should not be a problem. The pronunciation is no more different from the standard than O Sidhail's ""Learning Irish"", a very popular course using Connacht Irish, or the ""Irish On Your Own"" course which uses Ulster Irish. Munster Irish was until recently the most widely learnt outside the Gaeltacht areas, so most Irish speakers would understand the pronunciation used on these tapes. It is similar in most respects to the pronunciation used in 'standard' courses such as ""Teach yourself Irish"" by O Se. The main problem with this set is that it leaves you knowing very little Irish - a longer course is needed."
1,This thing sucks,"We bought this based on other reviews.... it is a waste of money. It teaches you a bunch of crap you don't need to know. Not that some of the things wouldn't be useful later if you want to be truely fluent in Irish, but in the first CD, why are you teaching someone how to say ""God Bless the Work""???? Like that's going to come up in conversation? These cd's really suck. I don't know why they put so much ""useless"" information/sentences/words in there, and stayed away from basic speech so much. This thing is just a mess. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone! It is a total waste of money! BLAH!"
4,"Great course, as far as it goes","An excellent and effective way of learning to speak and understand. Very inexpensive - worth much more. As another reviewer said, a 30-lesson course would be great. This 8 lesson course is very worthwhile, but limited in scope. I could have done without the last lesson's endless repetition of phrases for asking a lady to lunch, and ""my place"", ""your place"", or ""the hotel"", and instead would have preferred a simple listing of many more words, with pronunciation. Things like car, plane, bus, pub, shop, music, school, book... basic things, so we could then say ""Where is the pub?"", When is the bus?"" A few useful phrases like ""My name is ___"", and ""How do you say ____"" And, as others have said, a written guide to go along with it would be very helpful - just a list of the words in English and Irish, to have a clue what they look like written out. Still, it's well worth getting, and going through several times."
3,Needs other support,"Good product to help learn the dialect, but needs other learning support. The audio words are sometimes hard to distinguish certain letter sounds."
4,Engaging and detailed,"Not an easy book to read but this autobiographical account is so detailed the reader can only wonder how Mr. Hickey retained all this information down to the smallest details after all his logues and diaries were lost in a shipwreck. Indeed, this volume is filled with minute details that fans of the Georgian and Regency era of England will enjoy. While the writing is dry and bogged down with details at times, this book deserves a rcommendation for anyone trying to get the feel for this chapter in history."
5,"Finally, a song to bring this country together!","This song is the best out there amongst the many post 9-11 songs that have been recorded. The voices are moving, the passages chosen from our Constitution and the Pledge are appropriate, and I can't help but feel that this song represents the pride that many patriots feel for their country. A song of honor- great job!"
1,Can this tragedy be made worse? Yes it can!,"This is what happens when amateurs get a hold of recording equipment. Simply awful, from the trite lyrics, to the overproduced, multilayered mishmash of production. Just hit yourself in the head with a hammer instead of listening to this confused ode to the 9-11 tragedy."
2,broken handle of carrier,We had parents that graciously donated this to our little league football team and unfortunately the durability of the carrier did not hold up. The part where you hold it broke on both sides. The part that the water bottles go into stayed intact. Just can't hold the carrier as it is intended w/o the handle part. Wish that it would've held up better! Did not last throughout the season (maybe only part of) and too bad the parents didn't get what they paid for.
3,You have to be a collector....,"Okay, so I actually LOVE this book. But, that's because I'm a collector. Anytime a new collection of Vaughn's work comes out, I've not much choice BUT to love it.This particular book collects a lot of the random strips, advertisements, and unfinished works Vaughn had kicking around. Pretty much everything that hadn't already been put into one of the previous collections (all of which are far superior). Sadly, this book comes off as an excuse to make some more money off the late, great, cartoon guru.But, I'm okay with that. There's still plently to enjoy. My particular favorites being the four page ""lizard zen"" section and ""the Amorous Adventures of Puck"" (the only previously unpublished material in this volume)If you are NOT a collector - BECOME ONE! (just kidding). Go get some of his stuff and you just might become one, though.If you're a first timer, try starting with one of the ""Erotica"" books or the first ""Cheech Wizard"" collection."
5,An Outstanding Book from a Player with Integrity.....,"Mike Schmidt not only was a tremendous baseball player, but has great talent as an author. He's right in musing that today's records are tarnished by meds, and the guilty escape unpunished. Schimdt has wit, yet his writing flows well and is absent of ego, making CLEARING a pleasure to read. The only book I've enjoyed more this year was John Galloway's FINE DINING MADNESS: The rules & realities of fine dining, which is an absolute laugh riot. Both books are well worthy of your time.Well done Mr. Schmidt!"
2,Nice try but...,"Very convoluted writing style. Difficult plot. The physical production of this work is poor - bad typesetting, poor editing, and misprinted pages."
4,Nice Read,"A very nice and easy book to read, though at times it did get rather busy and confusing. The Man Pilot, the sequel, is also an easy read."
5,A Vacation Read,"I enjoyed the book imensely. I found the style to be thought provoking, but at the same time easy going and amusing. It did not take too long for me to become part of the ""Pilot Family"". Hopefully there will be a sequel but better still that Secrets becomes the first of a Plantation series."
1,Plextor Dosn't Stand Behind Their Defective Products,"My first PX-716UF quit after six months.$20 to ship it to them and they send me another.The 2nd PX-716UF quit after four months and 30 burns.Plextor refused to replace the 2nd unit, since they onlycover the replacement for 3 months.Don't waste your money on their defective products."
2,Works great when it actually works,In short this drive is great when it actually works. I spent almost $80 trying to find cdr and dvd media that this drive would recognize. The most puzzling thing by far is that after burning many CDRs of a certain brand the drive would stop recognizing the brand of cdr for no apparent reason. It would work again later. So when the moons are aligned it worked. Plextor replaced my first one but the it started up again. Just a big hassle.So I won't be buying a Plextor drive again.
4,A dvd write drive that works close to 100% of the time,"I say close to 100% because I have had 2 failures doing writes to the drive. Yes, it could have been the software that froze, but it might have been the firmware too. Unlike the exact same drives reviewed by a few others, it has recognized every single blank DVD I have tried. I wish I could say that for the built-in NEC DVD+R that came with my Dell. It was always very picky and finally I gave up on it. Then I bought a second internal model made by IO Magic. It reads everything quite well but doesn't write DVD-anythings nor even CD-Rs. So it was onto an external Sony drive that works ok until the firmware somehow loses connection with the computer, and then the drive no longer appears (and the disc is ruined).Additionally, the Plextor's the only one that consistently works with DVDXCOPY or DVDNEXTCOPY."
2,No size description,"Was disappointed in the size of the cross (and chain). Product size was listed as 3.2 x 2.6 x 1.5 inches -- but this is the size of the box, therefore it is very hard to judge how large it is."
3,14 kt cross,A little lighter weight than I prefer. Not as durable as I would have liked it to be. Would not recommend for a child.
4,Dr Cramer's towel keeps you cool.,"I am an avid (some would say crazed) motorcyclist. It gets HOT in Central Texas, and its a fair trade for being able to ride through winter. But its 100 degrees out, and you put on a Jacket? Thats CRAZY talk. Yes, indeed it is, but you can soak this towel wrap it around your neck, especially over the arteries to the head, and feel much more comfortable. (And potentially safer, more alert, more relaxed, less stressed. You know, all the good thing that riding a motorcycle does for you.)When you get back home, rinse it off and wring it out (or throw it in the washer) and store it in a zipper bag. If you do not take the extra time you will be sorry!"
4,excellent home-friendly dnb,"for 14 cents you can't go wrong with this blame & justice forgotten side project from 96. ""repro house"" is still unlike anything else in dnb...crisp, cutting edge beats with hypnotic keys and vocal bits. ""electric soul"" is probably my favorite...very melancholy bass line with atmospherics galore! highly recommended gemm from the days when drum & bass had more in mind than just tabs & glowsticks ;p"
2,Poor Craftmanship Not New Daylight Savings Time Ready,"The clock itself would look beautiful if the swing arm was close to being centered. Mine is about a 1/2"" off center. That I can live with but shouldn't have to at this price. What really bothers me is that it wrong for a week due to the change in daylight savings time.I suggest that you confirm that you are getting an updated clock before placing your order."
5,Just as advertised,"I purposely waited a couple of months since my purchase to ensure the clock performed as expected. It does! We added a breakfast room to our kitchen and decided we needed a clook on one of our new walls. I liked the idea of a radio controlled clock to keep accurate time and to adjust for the changes for day light savings.The clock was delivered in a few days, was in excellent condition. Assembly was a snap and it has performed flawless even since.I would recommend this clock to family and friends."
5,Loricron Atomic Regulator Wall Clock,This clock not only offers precision accuracy that you can use to set all your clocks by but is an attractive wall decoration as well.
4,Good Clock - Poor Pendulum,"The clock would frequently reset its time at first. That issue was solved by using a brand new battery. Since then, the clock has worked great.The pendulum of the clock would not swing. The pendulum mechanism requires a AA battery. River City sent me another pendulum mechanism and it did not work either. I think this pendulum mechanism is poorly designed, although the customer service person hinted that these clocks have another pendulum mechanism.If the pendulum mechanism worked, I would rate this clock 4 stars. If it didn't need a battery for the pendulum, I would rate it 5 stars. If you have to have a radio-controlled, schoolhouse type clock, you might not have any other options.Update: River City sent me the other pendulum and mechanism. It required a drill and a small Phillips screwdriver to install in the clock, but it was a simple operation. The new mechanism works, so I will change my rating to 4 stars."
4,Classy Atomic Clock,"This is a very nice looking clock which is fit for hanging in any room. The case is well made with a nice finish. I agree, however, with the reviewer who indicated the pendulum swings too fast. Even so that's a minor issue which I probably wouldn't have noticed had I not read the other review. My one complaint, hence only four stars, is that when I initially attempted to set the clock automatically for the central time zone it kept defaulting to the pacific zone. Once I set the time manually it has ever since kept the right time and updates correctly."
1,Not as shown,"I ordered and received 2 of these clocks and they are not what they appear. The clock does not have a second hand, River City does not make a school house clock that has a second hand. The clocks that I had to return had a minute hand that was approx 2 minutes fast."
3,river City Clock Radio Controlled Schoolhouse,"Nice clock. Read all the reviews, they are fairly accurate. My clock does not recognize the new daylight savings, so the radio controlled adjustment is useless. Must set time by hand when daylight savings starts. After two weeks the time is very accurate, have not had to adjust. Quality of cabnet and clock works is average. Good value for the quality of the clock. You could spend 4x the dollars and get a better wall clock, but I am happy with the price. If I had to do it over I would go for the Seiko schoolhouse clock with roman numerals. My wife does not like roman numerals, so we got the River City Clock with regular numbers."
5,This is the best intro to Roky's weird world,"Black Sabbath only talks about being paranoid - Roky really brings you into his insane world, and it's worth the trip."
5,Roky rocks...,"My uncle used to be his manager, so that's how I learned about him. Of course, I just blew it off initially as some garage band he was hanging around with, but Roky has some rockin' good music! My faves on this album are: Creature with the Atom Brain: I crack up when he talks with the creature (""...but you're not Buchanan!""). Also my favorite Roky tune. Don't Shake Me Lucifer: Old fashioned loud rock 'n roll. I Walked with a Zombie: How many folks could write a song (covered by REM) with lyrics consisting solely of ""I walked with a zombie/I walked with a zombie/I walked with a zombie last night."" over and over and make it sound good? Night of the Vampire: Good Halloween music. Play this and the cover of Burn the Flame on the tribute CD. He has a lot of great tunes, however he also has plenty of less memorable ones. This album has many of his better songs."
5,good combination!,"The first time that I heard this song was at the final of Gatecrasher Disko Tech disk II. For me, this song was the perfect final for this trance compilation. It sounds very british, a typical aspect of Gatecrasher music compilations, and the background has a special melody. Hear and enjoy it."
5,gohan is the best!,"this toy is awsome! i have been looking everywhere for gohan in a namek outfit and this is just perfect and it also has changable outfit also!it also comes with 2 stands!1 for each outfit.but hes really loose,not loose enough for him to fall apart or anything,just loose.whoever wrote the last reveiw about this action figure did not know what they were writing about because this is an awsome toy,but then again,I didnt buy this off of amazon,I bought this off of ebay."
1,they got paid for this garbage,this cd really stinks its the worse i've ever heard these dorks are a bunch of talentless bozo's
5,TOTALLY HOT and CUTE,N' Sync is the best group of all time. My two favorites are Justin and Lance but they are just soooooo cute. They have everything. Keep up the FANTASTIC work.
5,"N Sync is the best band, and i'll tell you why...","N Sync, with no doubt, is not afraid to be themselves. It's very admiring and attractive. They all have great voices, and true variety on their CD. It's a 5 star, totally! They are great, and truly one of the best bands. They'll be together as a band for a long times because of their originality. Their not fake. I admire that. Kelly McLaughlin, (CaliKate1)"
1,It's suck.,"N'sync suck. they do have an excellent voice. Only thing I don't like about them is they copied music of other songs. Like there is one song in there sound like backstreet boys. There is one song also sound exactly like ""Cupic""by 112and ""water runs dry"" sing by Boyz II Men."
5,"Another Backstreet Boys? No, No.","Well, well. What can I say about these guys. HHmm. Well for one thing, they're not bad looking, however I will not say they're gorgeous hunks either. I do like their album. The songs are good to dance to and have fun with. I definitely compliment the writers, especially Denniz Pop, Max Martin, Full Force, and Veit Renn, for their ingenious talent and writing. My most favorite out of the entire album is 'N Sync's very first single, ""I Want You Back"". It has the best beat and great lyrics, even if there only two verses. So don't think these pretty boys are another Backstreet Boys. Unlike BSB, these cuties are not corny. These five guys each earn a star for having some really sweet voices. (Even the bass Lance)"
5,book,"This book has helped me through some very difficult times. I also bought a copy for my siblings to help them. Very well written, insightful, and helpful."
5,reduced to ashes,"Amazing these guys never cease to impress me. This album is great for anyone who is into technical death metal along the lines of hate eternal, divine rapture, and origin. I actually like deeds of flesh alot better than origin because of the simple fact that they can actually break into a groove without loosing any speed or heaviness, anyway if your into death metal, there should be no reason why you shouldn't have this brilliant cd."
4,Blank Journal Type Book,"This book looks great on the coffee table next to the Star Wars Chronicle book, and it's blank inside, to keep track of all your Star Wars notes, technical info, etc! Love it!"
1,Cheaply made and dries hard,"I bought this for my husband after he lost his Hydryx Workout Towel. He says this Cramer workout towel doesn't even compare to the Hydryx towel. It doesn't feel the same and when it dries, it dries hard so it's not comfortable to use."
4,"Classic Text, Fun Read","This is a classic. It used to sit on the shelves of beach and lake houses everywhere, I think. It is fully of interesting information, some useful for sailing and some useful for bar bets (you can stump a LOT of people by asking about the difference between ketch and a yawl, and this is the book that will end the argument). Its a fun ""browse.""The print is a bit small, and it is somewhat dated in its presentation. Its not meant to teach you to sail, but as a reference guide. I learn something or other every time I pick it up."
2,Zircon MultiScanner i700,I bought this scanner to be used on slightly textured drywall ceilings. It did not work at all on my ceiling - even when I put a piece of cardboard over the textured surface per instructions. I got no readings at all. I didn't send it back becuase it seems to work well on vertical surfaces - walls.
2,Too pricey for what it does,"When I make a decision to buy something, several hours of research goes into the product. I made a mistake purchasing this. Although not listed on the Amazon website, this device is supposed to find floor joists with up to 1-inch thick flooring. My subfloors are 3/4 inch. There are sections of plywood, OSB, and particle board in my home and a single floor joist was not found on any of them.It does wall studs well, as long as the insulation in the walls is not packed too tightly and there are not other items in the wall (such as vents or wires).It gave me several misreadings on live AC electrical wires as well.It did a fine job as a metal detector.Really, I believe you are better off buying a cheap one."
3,Exceptinoal variation on inherently flawed tool,"I was surprised to see few 3 star reviews, but I think thats the perfect rating for this exceptional stud finder. Note - that's an oxymoron. I think it works OK, but it's not too consistent. Nice that it tells you about wires, but sometimes you wonder. I really wanted to destroy it once when I couldn't find a stud in a wall. It turns out, there was no (vertical) stud in that wall! (concrete block shimmed) So it was right. Anyway It tries to find a center, but I'm not convinced it does, but it works better than nothing. I like to figure out the general spacing, average it over 3 studs and then just run the tape and mark from there."
2,If you only had three hands,ok..I read all the reviews and just dont get their raving over this product.If you can hold it down right it works but this is not that easy when it is over your head. For those of you who dont know how this thing works here is a quick run down. hold the top portion on the wall. Not over a stud because it calibrates when it turns on and if it is on a stud then it will read wrong. The top and the bottom section swivel independant from each other . you hold the top next to the wall and push down on the bottom and it turns on. if you lift the bottom just a little it turns off and you have to start over. I think the Ziroc scanner are a good product just not this setup.I returned mine and got the model a step down that is all one case and doesnt swivel.
1,ZIRCON i700,I READ A REVIEW THAT SAID HE HAD PLASTERBOARD OVER PLASTER WALLS AND THIS STUD FINDER WORK GREAT.DON'T BELEAVE IT. I HAVE 3/8 SHEETROCK OVER PLASTER WALLS AND IT DON'T WORK FOR ME.WERE I HAVE 3/8 SHEETROCK ONLY IT SHOWS A WATER PIPE AS A STUD AND CAN'T FIND THE STUD.
5,great cd - find one if you can!,This is a great cd. There are some decent reviews of it already online just look! Hopefully Shannon & Kristin will sing together again. If not it would be great to see them involved in solo projects or a new group!
3,Good thoughts but a little over the edge,"Control has some good thoughts and insightful social commentary, but it was a little over the edge. Bazan is a powerful storyteller. This can be dangerous, though, when he is trying to shock the listener into seeing who and what we are as a society. In a song about an adulterous tryst the listener experiences in a very real way the character's experiences. For someone who spends most of his time trying to AVOID thinking about committing adultery, experiencing it in a real way put me in a weird place. I wish Bazan could have used some other less effective way to communicate his message. Control is a pretty good album, but let the buyer be aware of it's adult themes."
3,"Hmm....Well, It wasn't really supposed to be like this....","See, Pedro the Lion has always had this innocence about them and this is the first time David seems to drift away from that (since when did he every swear in a song?). Bad Diary Days (It's hard to find a friend) was a good way to write about infidelity, but I'm not sure that these 3 (yes, 3!) songs get the point across better. It's the hinting that made Bad Diary Days good. This album is like David trying to be Thom Yorke. It's okay as an album, but not so great as a Pedro the Lion album."
1,Offensive and Should Not Be Bought,"This album sickened me to my stomach. I am 20 years old and love emo, punk, and Christian music. Even if I wasn't a Christian, this album would still offend me. This is claimed to be a Christian band, but it uses the s-word, and tells countless grotesque pictures of sex that should make you sick. They say he's a storyteller, but he needs to look at his values and understand the love of Jesus and that he is not winning any souls by putting out filth!"
2,I don't get it.,"I had a listen to this album, and I honestly tried, but I just can't see why everyone thinks PDL is so great. There are virtually no hooks, the melodies meander and never seem to resolve in a satisfying way, and I find nothing special about the musicianship. To me it just feels bland, and nothing compells me to listen to this CD again.The lyrics are the only redeeming feature, but I honesly can't see why anybody would want to listen to a song repeatedly on that strength alone.Of course taste is relative, and I don't mean to offend the fans. In fact I'm willing to admit that it's probably just me -- apparently whatever makes these guys so great just flies right over my head. Just being honest."
3,Gentle roars,"3 1/2For those who like a little more death with a little less cutie, these tuneful limitations will surely suffice."
4,Toe by Toe Program,"Very clear structure and easy to follow. I am confused however, why it's called a 'multisensory' program, no information about 'multisensory' strategies as such (besides writing and saying words/sounds). However, it will come in very useful and I look forward to using the program."
4,Delightful Series but No Subtitles!,"The Monarch of the Glen is a delightful series filmed on location in Scotland - the scenery is divine, the castle is amazing and the characters are (mostly) appealing, the plots are engaging, and the references to Scottish lore & customs fascinating. Seeing Julian Fellowes, creator of Downton Abbey, as the whacky neighbor and comrade-in-shenanigans of the even whackier elder laird is entertaining. But gosh darn it all - no subtitles! So owing to my hearing loss and even with special headphones and hearing aids I lose one half to one third of the dialogue. It's a testament to this series that I persist in watching it nevertheless! (PS: I've heard the series goes downhill after the younger laird leaves.)"
3,1 first video of monarch,"Loved the area and the castle both beautiful,story line good, but could not hear, no Closed Caption.Buy from Amazon often. Love British shows."
1,Truly Awful in every possible way,"Take a bad soap opera. Staff it with the worst actors you can find. Throw in some absurd & silly plots. Then insist the actors--all in the name of ""genuine accents"" of course--speak as if they all have mush (excuse me, oatmeal) in their mouths. Mix it all together, and you have some idea of the farce that is pedaled here. I challenge anyone but the most dedicated Scot (all 1000 of them) to understand more than 50% of the spoken dialogue.If you want to see some nice scenery, well, OK I get it. Clouds served up on demand, but it's still a nice setting. But the acting & the plots are excruciatingly and mind-numbingly opaque and silly. Read a book, put a puzzle together, spend time with your loved ones, but avoid this joke."
4,Beautiful Castle,"This ""movie for TV"" was great entertainment. I shared it with my sister and she bought ""series two"". I'm going to purchase ""series three"". The Scottish countryside is spectacular. The castle is beautiful. The characters grow on you and you just have to see what happens next. I understand it was a great success in Great Britain."
5,"Denali Denali Denali, where have you been all my life?","I try not to like bands for aesthetic values like how the people look or their style, etc. but Denali's initial appeal to me was from a newspaper press photo I saw of them on a bus or a train. It was cool and somewhat detached and it made me curious. I read the description and it mentioned Goldfrapp and Bjork and Led Zepplin and I thought, I HAVE to hear this record. I was not disappointed. From the opening haunted whispers of ""French Mistake"" to the bells winding down at the end of ""Where I Landed"" I enjoyed every peak and valley of this album. Maura Davis's voice is still developing and she is still finding her identity but I could tell she is on a path to greatness and as long as these four continue to grow with each other, I know we are going to see (hear) amazing things from them. Do yourself a favor and discover them now."
3,Semi denied,"Music of a mostly emotionally cloying variety with an amateurish chordal instinct guiding the entire process, but during many swelling moments the vocalist is capable of cracking the most cynical of skulls."
5,Flawless!,I love rock music of all kinds and this to me is just a great CD however you want to catagorize it.
4,Hauntingly Beautiful Alt/Chillout Music.,"From the first moment that I heard the vocals on this album, I was hooked. Denali play an eclectic style of alternative rock, with cool, spacey reverb-drenched guitar, jazz-lounge style percussion, and almost emo-like lyrics full of ambiguous loss and confusion. This is all fine and good, but the singer, Maura Davis, simply has one of the most beautiful, emotive and ethereal voices I have ever heard.....simply mesemerizing. Her vocal style really sets this band apart, and combined with the slowly wandering and hypnotic music, creates a stark, melancholy space in my head. Sort of like what would happen if you combined a better, more sensual Portishead with Doves.....Highly recommended."
5,aaaaaaaaaaamazing,"I want to live inside this music. This CD is totally awesome, and Maura has an incredibly strong but haunting voice, a mix of early Gwen Stefani from No Doubt and Delores O'Something from the Cranberries. The music is intense and mellow at the same time.My personal favorite on this album is #2 - You File.This is one of those CDs that you can just put on repeat while youre doing something else, and listen to it four or five times through without even realizing it.Get it, hear it, please!"
5,A great unknown band,"One listen to the song Gunner showed me why this band has the talent to go far in the music business. This CD on a whole is wonderful, the song ""Lose Me"" shows the range of Maura's voice, and the wandering piano in ""Function"" shows a real maturity. While I've heard Maura's voice compared to Beth from Portishead, I don't think Maura's voice is that mature yet, but given the band's relatively young age, this band should have a great future, and this is a great starting point."
1,came apart FIRST wearing,the very first time my son wore these for a banquet. They came apart at the bottom. The sole was loose in the heel area. I have never had a problem with anything I got from Amazon before :(
4,"Nice shoes, good price.",I bought these for my nephew who's in Catholic school and it looks great and he loves it. RI_Maam
1,got used shoes,"This is the first time that I've had an issue with an Amazon product, and I've bought plenty from Amazon. This pair of shoes for my son was ""gently used"". I suspect this was a returned item, but it has definately been worn. Since it did not look too bad, and I didn't have time to return it for another pair, I kept it. I would think that the folks responsible for inspecting returned items would do a better job of checking the merchandise before reselling it."
5,Glinka's Piano Works,"Glinka's music is so important because he was the first Russian composer to write music that sounded Russian. Glinka is often called the father of Russian music, mostly because of his influence he had on other Russian composers in the nineteenth century. This group of composers, that included Tchaikovsky, Scriabin and Rachmaninov, idolized Glinka's music to establish a nationalistic Russian way of composing. Glinka composed little for piano and most of these pieces are hardly ever explored or recorded. Besides a number of very short miniatures like the mazurkas, there are many variation works, mostly upon opera themes, and the longer Valse Fantaisie, which the composer later orchestrated. My favorite song by Glinka is his Nocturne in F Minor. His music is romantic and very sentimental. This is a nice compilation of Glinka's best works for the piano. Sadly, there is not that much to choose from, but this is a very good place to start."
4,quality and equality,"From top to bottom a consistently enjoyable selection of beats. Thankfully Mark Farina isn't trying to keep up with the current trend of masquerading R&B as house music(naked music style). There's nothing too hard-core on here, anyone that likes their beats served up with blazing intensity will be disappointed. But for folks who enjoy Farina's style, the ""mushroom jazz"" smoothness, this album promises more of the same good stuff...check out track 2: the accordion on this track is unusual, humorous and quite choice. This disk would be a good accompaniment to: sophisticated trouble-making, den re-spackling, strolling around oslo. I wouldn't recommend listening to it while running from the cops or while making a sandwich."
3,Where is Mark?,"Coming from any other DJ, this mix would be something to be proud of. Technically there's nothing wrong with the mix, and some of the tracks pass the taste test. And I am sure OM has sold a lot of copies - something they need to do more and more these days since they've lost the talent battle to Naked. But if you've ever heard Farina spin live - either house or downtempo, it doesn't matter - you'll listen to something like ""Connect"" and realize that Farina is taking the money gigs and running. His ""United DJs of America"" release was the same way - good in spots, but surprising to those who know his abilities in the underground realm. Please, Mark, put out something for the subterranean crew - after all, we did do you the favor of putting you on the map."
3,NOT HIS BEST WORK...,"If you're into ""deep"" house, this disc won't really get your groove on until track 10 - the first 9 tracks are throwaways. He's done better with his ""San Francisco Sessions"" mix."
2,Danceable CD but the pace gets to be too much,"This cd is very good but after dancing to it for a few tracks, I got tired of the same endless beat for every song. 'Connect' got unconnected after playing it a few times. It seems more like a workout cd than a dance cd. I like more varied beats and creativity when I listen to dance music. This record is just one formula...a canned beat with different instrumentals. Marques Wyatt's 'For Those Who Like to Get Down' is much better. Great for a non-stop dance marathon."
1,"Cloying, Annoying and Simple Minded","While the author does manage to work in some interesting analysis of evolutionary psychology, the bulk of this book is a mix of patronizing anatomy lesson with self serving speculation on all things female. And as the following passage makes clear, the writing is often just awful. ""But, gals, there's no denying it: sometimes we stink, and we know it. Not like strawberry yogurt or a good Cabernet but like, alas, albacore. Or even skunk. How does this happen? If you haven't bathed for a week, I'll let you figure it out for yourself."" This is the work of a Pulitzer winner?"
4,A must read or re-read for every woman or man who loves women,"What do you really know about female biology. Author Natlie Angier a Pulitzer Prize winner takes on everything from organs to orgasm. She goes into such topics as menopause, female anger/aggression and evolutionary ideas. She writes about biology for the NY Times and knows her stuff. A great book for a college student or pre-med student or a senior citizen. Start with how one perfect solar cell forms and what is involved in female chrosome. The author covers a whole chapter on the Clitoris and all of its 8000 nerve fibers and moves on to talk about the Uterus and the breast and breast milk. Ovaries get their due and hormones estrogen, testotsterone and women and desire all get their own sectins. Why muscle not fat. And what role does evolutionary psychology play in making women vs men. Bonding and oxytocin --complex female bonding stuff and more."
1,a total disappointment,"The book is millions miles away from what claimed in the review. If you are already a fairly well educated woman, this is absolutely not for you. I'd return the book if I could."
1,"More of the same feminist perspective ""science"" -Boring","Yes, I read it all, as boring as it is. This woman needs to get a refresher course in scientific methodology. As bad as it gets no one seems willing to critize the book: After all it's feminist ideology and literary reviewers have to pay their mortgages too."
1,psuedo poetic tone gets REALLY annoying,"i was given this book as a graduation present. as a feminist, i was excited to read something indepth (and praising) of the female body.to put it nicely, i was highly disappointed. . .angier's psuedo poetic tone became really annoying really quickly. in fact, in order to get to the real information, i had to get past that. that is hard to do. therefore i found the book very uninformative.i understand that many people have nothing but praises for this book, but if you get annoyed with rambling and a run around approach, then you will not enjoy this book.(well, maybe you can use it as a humor book, as my friend and i did...)"
3,I tried really hard to read this book.......,"I tried so hard to read this book. I bought it on the recommendation of a friend who told me that this would help me improve my self-esteem about my ""rounded"" body type. I tried so hard, but was unable to see where this book was going and how it was supposed to help me. Now, I don't claim to be an avid reader of nonfiction, but there were times I would read passages over and over and over again to try and make sense of what she was trying to say and what it meant to me. Don't get me wrong it was an intersting book, but I failed to see how it helped me (not everyone, just me).....Bottom line, it will be a long time before I personally read something from this offer again, it just took to much work to figure out what she was trying to say."
3,"Good read, if you can get past the author's personality","I picked up this book in order to gain a greater understanding of women. I found a lot of informative information. However, you must brace yourself against the author's pretentious personality and her vehement feminism. She seems to be in a perpetual state of defensiveness. When picking up this book, I had no intention of being subjected to a feminist tract. Of the many author's I've read, this is the first one that managed to irritate me on a personal level. There's some objective and interesting information here, but you have to wade through the manifestations of her jadedness to get to it. You make the call; it's not a COMPLETE waste of time. Ms. Angier, relax."
5,Excellent mind-expanding book,This is the perfect antidote to all the negative images conveyed by the media about women's bodies and sexuality. Every woman should read this book if she wants to appreciate what a work of art the female body is. Knowledge truly is power!
5,"For the intelligent, open-minded, inquisitive reader...","Others need not ""apply"". Angier's ""Woman"" is remarkably informative AND entertainingly presented. My only regret is not having read it before having an elective hysterectomy. Every gynecologist and surgeon should read this book."
4,A book both women AND men should read,"Angier ties together, in a highly readable manner, the complexities of the human body very, very well all the while never loosing site of the whole.I disagree with her on a few points. I don't think she sufficiently looked at human relationships as far as she could but, overall, this is minor."
1,This is science writing?,"Although the premise of this book is promising and there are a few interesting little facts any real value is obscured by Angier's tired attempts at stylistic wit, complete failure to appropriately cite scientific findings, and blatantly opinionated feminist rhetoric. I was looking forward to learning more about the science behind the mystery of the female body. Needless to say, I was very disappointed."
2,A well-written delusion,"The author expends her energies on a diatribe against science, specifically evolutionary psychology, because the social constructs in her head cannot accept that some things just ARE! Evolution shaped human behavior and neither the cant nor the barbed wit can change that. Join the author and deconstruct yourselves into the past of myth and superstition. A big step backwards, the author would rank with the famous ""debunkers"" of Darwin, except that she is not of this caliber."
4,Expanding a man's mind!,"What I look for in any book is something new, be it humour, wisdom, splendid writing or plain information. 'Woman' supplies all four.After reading this book I feel as if I'm looking at women with new eyes. Any book that expands the mind is worth reading.The polarised reviews suggest that this is a great book - if it's ordinary, why the fuss? - read it and make up your own mind. Love it or hate it, you will be a changed person after."
2,"Distasteful, misleading, psuedo-poetic","I'm concerned about the comments of the reader below who accuses a critic of this book of being anti-intellectual. Indeed, one need only peruse a chapter or two of WOMAN to grasp that intellectuals in particular will be offended by its offerings. Angier seems to fancy herself a poet, but in truth her writing has all the poetic sensibility of a Hallmark greeting card. Her prose reels from purple to polemic, with now and then a crude attempt at the vernacular aside. And her science is anedotal, spotty and at times misleading, although her blast at evolutionary psychology, though not entirely well argued, is certainly welcome. As a feminist I found this book patronizing. As a scientist I found it disappointing. And as someone who enjoys fine writing, I found it pedestrian."
2,blah,"I picked this up in the library, which is good, because this is not a book I'd want to keep on my shelves. Like the reviewer below, I really don't understand the hoopla. I mean the author got it into her head to voice her opinions on all things female, and being a New York Times reporter she found someone to publish it. She doesn't have anything new or particularly interesting to say, and yet she seems intent on screaming at the reader as though she did. Her writing style swings from Hallmark card to rant--it's just plain annoying. And her arguments are often just as poorly grounded as the arguments of those she critiques. So why the big deal?"
5,Amazing Album,"After releasing Misplacced Childhood, most Marillion fans weren't sure how it could be possible to follow up on such an ambitious and amazing album. On Clutching at Straws we see a band that not only found the ""pocket"" but gone ahead and taken up residence there. To me, this has always been my favorite Marillion album.While Fish has never been one to be shy regarding personal topics when it comes to his lyrics, he provides a glimpse here into some of the struggles the band was goign through personally as well as with their label. As always though, when Fish is going through some of the lowest of the low points in his life, he tends to produce his best work (as evident iwth his new release, 13th Star).This album marks the end of the Fish era for Marillion, and for many fans, the band has not been quite the same since."
3,"Works, but not as well as I hoped","I have no space in my car for a mount, so this cupholder solution was my only option. It works pretty well, but in my car it can get knocked out pretty easily. It probably spends as much time on my floor as in it's proper location. May be different in a car with a better cup holder placement. Mine is right near my elbow."
1,cup holder for golflogics,"Totaly worthless, the manufacturer say amazon will not change the product discription for this. It doesn't fit a golflogics gps. I'm done with amazon after that purchase."
2,The Brother of Daphne - Dornford Yates,"This title is one I read many years ago and enjoyed it again. However, I was very disappointed in the format of the paperback - it is 8 x 10 and looks like a typewritten thesis, in pale grey ink. It is somewhat difficult to read and definitely difficult to handle. I shall not purchase any more in this format."
3,Nice sounds but...,"Pleasant, but not all that original. The influences motivating this music are too easily discernable. The result is formulaic - albeit a much more complex formula than the vast majority of the drivel that passes for music."
5,keep skinny wolves at bay.,"People as net browsers, tend to write reviews that usually talk about how the album they are reviewing, was good or bad or just really trite and didn't cover any new ground. They might tell you to get this album, and how it's just really mind blowing and that it something to own.I would like to do something different.I want to thank all of you that wrote positive reviews about this album that made me go out and get it. I want to thank each and every one of you that told me how good it was.I want to thank you all for letting me know that I wasn't wasting my money on this album. Thank you all very much.You are all wonderfull."
4,Finally! It's back on vinyl! ...But there's a catch.,"Let me preface my complaint by saying this is one of my all-time favorite albums and I am very happy that Plain Records has reissued the entire Sparklehorse catalog in vinyl at reasonable prices.Now: BABIES ON THE SUN & MORNING HOLLOW HAVE BEEN CUT!!!!Yes I expected the hidden track ""Morning Hollow"" wouldn't make the cut but ""Babies On The Sun"" is gone? How can an incredible album-ending song of that caliber be removed from Linkous's most perfect album??? I'm assuming it's due to time restraints. As I said, I'm happy to have it anyway but buyers be warned. You are purchasing 95% of ""It's A Wonderful Life."" There ain't no babies on the sun today.If you want the original LP with all the tracks be prepared to shell the same amount of money one could spend to pick up the entire Sparklehorse vinyl reissue catalog."
5,Listen to This Loud and More than Once,"Sparklehorse once opened for Cracker in Denver at the Bluebird, and completely stole the show. I was hooked at once and forever with their stage show and music. His first album was very nice, but ""It's a Wonderful Life"" has transcended the other albums in both content and recording expertise. Echo's of the first album are very evident, but his explorations into alternative musical recording techniques are expressive and infectious. ""King of Nails"" works a distorted acoustic guitar into a percussive slap, but integrates all the other sounds into a song. ""Dog Door"", however, has to be the most innovative recording with a bass line that moves your entire chest, and makes you lean forward to decipher the words. Best Album of the Year."
4,Etherial Rock,Dreamy and fuzzy. Even at it's most up tempo moments this album will not get you dancing. If you want music to doze off to than this is your savior.
3,Alt-sadness from sensitive record,"3 1/2Beautiful, depressing slow-core at it's best, slightly jarring and disconnected at worst, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" captures artist Mark Linkous at his melancholic height, barely escaping the album's minimalistic haunted nature with the few less emotionally heavy rockers on here. While not for everyone who is into their forward momentum mentality, chill out with this alt rock gem when you want a nice shimmering slow ride into loneliness, and it's hopefully subsequent inspirations."
3,Good rainy day music,"Getting older does mean getting wiser in the sense that, yes I have heard it all before. And I like Sparkle horse. However I can think of many bands that do sound similar. If I were 20 years old and stumbled upon these guys i would be in love!However I am twice that age. In fact I remember stumbling on to ""snore core"" several years ago. The droning, moody driving music is just up my dark alley! This minimilistic sound is certainly not ground breaking and has been explored many times in Pop music,(Velvet Underground, The Feelies...)With that said Its a Wonderful life is really good example of this genre. Put it on a rainy day and don't do anything but watch the rainy drip slowly down your windows. Too happy? Put this CD on and relish the musicaly inspired downer..."
5,Sublime work!,"Sometimes we hear about bands that aren't selling too many records, but are great. That's the case of Sparklehorse with this ""It's A Wonderful Life"".This record is not only very depressing, but also very, very beautiful, full of melody and sounds. In songs like the rocker ""Piano Fire"" and the ballad ""Eyepennies"" we can hear the excelent P.J. Harvey, and in ""Hold Day"" and ""Apple Bed"", Nina Persson(The Cardigans) show her beautiful voice. But the highlights of this work are the dark-beauty ""Sea Of Teeth"" and the sad ballad that bring me to tears ""Little Fat Baby"".This is a work plenty of beauty, inspiration and, above all, very good taste. Go out and buy it, without any hesitation. It's a sublime work..."
5,This is the musical equivalent of Capra's crowning glory.,"So my friend says to me, ""you need the new Sparklehorse"" and I'm thinking ""yeah, I need that like I need a..."" I wasn't overly impressed with their first album so I was a bit skeptical, but M is usually right so I took a chance.Wow! This album is incredible. At times I feel I'm listening to Mercury Rev (probably because there are some guest appearances) and to me that's a very good thing. In addition to Sparklehorse's obvious talent there are several guest artists and collaborators (besides Merc. Rev)that make this record really come alive. (PJ Harvey and Tom Waits are a couple of my faves.) If you've been ""sittin' on a fence"" trying to decide whether or not to add this to your collection, buy it. You won't be sorry. This album is worth every penny and more."
5,novela a compás de bolero,"Me encantó esta novela. No sé mucho de estilos literarios, pero encontré el texto casi hipnotizante. Me han dicho que está escrito de una manera que se puede cantar al ritmo de un bolero. Es casi como haber visto una película - puedo imaginar los personajes y las escenas del libro como si los hubiera visto, en vez de visualizado al leer.Mayra Santos Febrés es un talento inmenso. Personalmente me encantan las novelas por poetas - espero que nos de muchas más."
1,Kareena and Saif are rubbish,"Presenting titless Kareena looking like a patient of TB. Her long horse face with that hanging crocodile jaw makes me want to whack her with a slab of granite. Her current boy(uncle)friend Saif is there shaking his considerable booty, I reckon, he seriously needs to check some Man-bra. Not forgotting Akshay ( My God!!!!) - Mr. Billy Goat, rubbish of the lowest category. I hope something very bad happens to him..."
2,People really don't really like their favorite tunes changed almost completely,"""The biggest problem here is that Koch fails to distinguish clearly who's performing on this industrial tribute album. Even when you look in the liner notes, you still don't know where these guys are from. What band is Robbie Robb & Chris Gavin from? There's a few musicians you'll know, but they're mostly b-listers. The next issue is that people really don't really like their favorite tunes changed almost completely. A couple of the songs are now rap tunes, and others eliminate key vocal of guitar parts."""
3,don't know ... present for NOW EX-hubby,"don't know ... it had been a present for NOW EX-HUBBY ... I think, he still has it"
3,Nice scent,Scented Kerosens additive sure helps with the kerosend smell from the heater. Everyone who has one should use this. Fast shipping
5,Hawaiian soul lives in the voice of Free & Easy,"Buy this album and you won't be sorry. I picked it up on the north shore of Kauai about a year ago. Every time I play this beautiful music I am put back on the beaches and magical rainforests of that most beautiful of Hawaiian isles. Simple clean sounds -- high pitched traditional gentle Hawaiian vocals, ukuleles, guitars -- all blended together in a harmony that could only be found as the product of a culture as strong as the proud Hawaiians. Simply Hawaiian is, just that. Much love to this band. Aloha from a state-side haole!"
3,Wrong Plugs,"Champion (71) RC12YC Traditional Spark Plug, Pack of 1I ordered (8) Champion RC12YC spark plugs and received (6) and (2) with different numbers. Wasn't worth the expense to send two back for an exchange so bought a couple more at a local parts house."
3,Sea-Trading Vol 1 - The Ships,"While not having viewed the entire series of three volumes, The Ships stands as a very good introduction to the types of commercial merchant ships of the day. Now out of print, there is much to be updated. The new shipbroker or charterer may get some good points of insight to the industry from this work, but the experienced one probably won't derive much anew."
2,Disappointing,"This book has a somewhat inflated reputation, due in part to the language (use of the ""f word"") which was very daring for its time. Many of the characters are one-dimensional and forgettable. The main protagonist is impossibly noble, staying in the lower ranks instead of taking an easy promotion. The men also have an absurd knack for repeatedly finding fine champagne and good food. The dialog is tiresome: apparently the speech of the lower classes and Scotsmen is composed largely of apostrophes. And as for the big climax, you can see it coming a mile away. This book may have been groundbreaking in its day, but now it's just dated."
5,great music that is badly produced,the production on this disc isn't much to get excited about...but the musicianship is amazing. Canvas Solaris impresses me beyond words.
2,Daylight Savings Time Does Not Operate Properly,This clock includes a chip that was designed to change the time. When the new daylight savings time was effective the clock would not reset to the new time. Interestingly the manufacturer has not removed the clocks from inventory or attempted to inform buyers of the issue as of yet. Other than that it is a beautifull clock!
5,What a Great Clock!,"This is a great clock. When I bought it about a week ago, I put the battery in the clock, and placed it on the wall in my family room where my old clock used to be. That was it. At first the clock appeared to be broken but within 5 minutes it adjusted itself and has been running perfectly ever since. This clock can be seen clearly in my family room from 25ft away. As I get older I like things to be bigger and this clock gets the job done while still looking attractive. My wife likes the clock because she does not confuse the short hand with the long hand from a distance."
1,Doesn't adjust for daylight savings time,"I've owned this clock for about a year and a half now, and it is great except that it won't adjust for daylight savings time in the spring. As others have mentioned I've tried everything to reset it, but it always ends up an hour early until fall. The clock is on a wall near large, south-facing windows, and I live by a major city, so radio signal is not the problem. If you live in the central, mountain, or pacific time zones, you could adjust for DST manually by pressing the button for the next time zone over. However, for the Eastern Time Zone, you'll just have to live with it being an hour off all summer. Note that it is not possible to override the radio signal and adjust the clock yourself."
5,On Time Now,"""I can't stand looking at two clocks displaying two different times and neither one is right. Problem solved! Like other reviews on the internet, time setting does not seem to match the instructions. ""Power on, clock advances to 4 AM. Press time zone clock advances to correct time."" Ours stopped exactly two hours short. After watching the clock for two hours I could not stand it anymore, and selected the central time zone again. It corrected itself and the clock and I have been happy ever since. Amazing!More amazing though...... I did not even get into trouble for replacing the wife's Tuscany style clock. Merry Christmas."""
1,Daylight Saving Time Warning,"I don't own this clock, but I do own one of it's sister clocks, the Tambour Style Mantel Clock, and it did not change for DST now that the date has changed. Even though I've owned my clock for all of a month and a half, River City Cuckoo Clocks does not consider this fact to be a defect. Since I would assume that all their radio controlled clocks have the same electronics, I would be very wary about buying this clock."
1,Radio-controlled clock,"I ordered this clock to put on the wall above my large TV. According to instructions that was not a good placement. It needed to be so many feet away from TV's etc. I really liked this clock, but I returned it because I didn't want it on any of my other walls.It is a very nice looking clock."
4,Wigo Flat Iron,"Nice Styling Iron, but remember to ship til to Europe mounted with a European mains plug, especially when the model is called ""Europe""."
5,4 x 6 photo magnets,Very pleased with product; easy to apply to 4 x 6 photos. Needed to reorder and will be ordering again.
3,"A Treat, though a one-sided one","David Hockney, who has a good eye for space and color, loves the Chinese skill with space. He shows us how to look at these scrolls. It's interesting for any age (above 8, I'd say). Poor Venetian Canaletto plays the role of the whipping boy; linear perspective is dismissed as so very limited. We must be careful of that sort of either/or pose in visual things. So now Hockney should make a Canaletto video."
4,Nice,"It's a nice poster. I think it's the British one; the rating is 15 instead or R. It's slightly (by about an inch each way) larger than most retail posters.The price isn't bad, although shipping's a little high, but if you buy multiple posters it doesn't seem so steep. :)"
5,Traver always a good read,"Like Trout Madness, this one by Traver is just fun to read. He writes with a light touch and real wisdom."
5,Very nice cross...perfect for Protestants,"As an episcopalian, I wanted a plain gold cross- nothing gaudy. However, I wanted one of substantial weight and solid. This cross fills the bill perfectly.One caveat- you will need to buy a chain. The flimsy one supplied is a throw-away. I suggest the chain amazon sells for $80 (same price as the cross) which is a box design. It looks great with the cross."
2,"Love, Bones & Water",Very strange book & not what I expected. Maybe it was just me but couldn't understand the whole thing.
3,"Not my favorite from Girlyman, but a good album","My introduction to Girlyman came with their outstanding album Little Star, which I still consider one of my favorite albums of the past five years or so. By comparison I was a little disappointed with Joyful Sign. The rich, shimmering harmonies are still here in spades, but I find the music to somehow lack the energy and momentum that charged most of Little Star. This is still a good album however and will probably be well received by fans."
5,Outstanding CD,"It's been driving me crazy: I can't remember how or where I first heard about Girlyman. However I did, I'm grateful. They're wonderful!This purchase actually was a birthday gift for a friend -- I've been listening to my own copy (and singing unharmoniously along in the car) for months -- and the recipient just called yesterday with enthusiastic thanks, saying I always choose to her taste with my gifts of music.The songs are beautifully written, the harmonies are gorgeous, the instrumentation simple and fitting. And they're every bit as good in concert as they are on CD, or even better. They performed a few new songs at the last live show I attended, so I hope it won't be too long before their next recording is out. Thanks for the music, Doris, Ty and Nate!"
5,Joyful Sign is an awesome album,"I already owned this CD, and every other CD by Girlyman, so there was no risk in this purchase. I bought it as a gift for friends of ours.In the past, I purchased Girlyman CDs directly from their site, to support the artists. This time, the Amazon price was significantly more attractive, and with free shipping (I bought other stuff at the same time), I decided to buy it here.Everything that Girlyman does is fantastic, but if I could only have one of their CDs, I would choose this one, Joyful Sign (their latest).[...]"
5,Can't stop listening...,"This is truly a great CD; Girlyman continues to grow as songwriters and performers. If you ever get the chance to see them live, they are awesome!"
1,False advertising,This cd did not have the candlelight version of the song as stated!!! I was not happy and to send it back would be too much hassle
5,Heaven is nice!,"When I first heard this song I knew it was a cover, but it is so brilliantly different that I couldn't remember how it had originally been done. (No) Thanks to the first reviewer below, I now do remember. I would like to suggest that covering songs is a totally valid and worthy practise (funnily enough I've noticed a few opera stars and concert pianists, not to mention school children, covering Mozart and Beethoven in recent years). When someone is able to see detect something in a song that lets them know that they can take it away and turn it into their own, and they then do that it is a beautiful thing. I love this song to death and can listen to it ten times in a row without getting even slightly sick of it."
5,Eurodance Heaven!,"You know a song was worth covering when the cover version is even better than the original. DJ Sammy has managed not only to improve upon the original, but to create one of the best tracks of 2002 standing on it's own merit! The pace and style of this Euro-Trance offering is very much like DJ Encore's ""I See Right Through To You"" with a splash of keyboards a-la Robert Miles' ""Children"" (circa '96). Absolutely stunning work! The remixes were fairly disappointing, however, and the Extended Remix of DJ Sammy's original album/radio version is your best bet. If you absolutely MUST have a remix (and a lengthy one at that!), the Anastasia (yep, Ms. ""One Day In Your Life"") Remix is the only one worth your time."
2,"Basically, the songs just are not very good","The Waterboys? I don't think so. This is another Mike Scott solo album with ""The Waterboys"" printed on the cover. This album is about as far from a Waterboys album as one Led Zeppellin is from Van Morrison. Don't get me wrong, I like Mike Scott's solo work, but here he is far from top form. Dark, but not involving. Raw, but without the inspired energy of earlier work. Basically, the songs just are not very good. Scott's studio doodling with voice synthesis fails utterly. There is simply no flow here. You can't fault the man for experimenting, but you can fault me for buying it without hearing it first."
2,Brilliant Songwriting under the annoying production,Say Mike Scott at First Avenue supporting this album. Thesongs were awesome but the album's production is truly annoying!!
5,Funtown is my Favorite!,"This CD should be called ""Happiness Tickles"" because it tickled me in all of the right places with pure glee. These songs make me want to bake delicious, fluffy, pink-frosted cakes with rainbow dots on top. I loved every track and look forward to hearing more from The Beards."
5,Soooooooo incredible!,"Ladies from The Muffs and Tiger Trap combine to make this beautiful pop collection of lost-love songs and punky heartache. Produced by the band and Redd Kross' Jeff McDonald, the tunes are both remarkably tender(""Sidewalks"", ""t.s. eliot"")and ballsy(""Make it in America"", ""Big Dumb World""). A lot of my friends still can't get used to Kim Shattuck's gloriously doofy presence and gravelly voice, but this is a nice introduction to her as she's not front-and-center at all times(as with The Muffs). I hope some Muffs fans are born with the album, it would be nice to see. A+"
5,Loved It,"Rawkin pop/punk, this enhanced disc also includes 11 videos to accompany each song, viewable on your personal computer. Get it now! Shattuck absolutely rocks on guitar and her voice is wickedly distinctive. Marr's slight Canadian accent makes every vowel that comes out of her mouth more of a pleasure to listen to. If beards were truly like these ladies it would be enough to make any guy wish he were a 'mo."
5,Britney is a great singer.,"I love Britney. It is refreshing to see a girl like that make it. All of these other boys band can't compare to her. I think all the hype was right. It is a great cd with amazing songs on it. Maybe next time she will write a little of her own stuff. She grew up from a small town and that inspires me to get out of my town too. She has inspired a lot of people and all of the rumors I wish would stop. Unless the one I heard about her going to Marquette next year for college is true because I like near Milwaukee, WI. I have only one word for Britney and that is Amazing."
2,Not enough unique ideas in this book!,I was looking for a book with a lot of unique ideas and was very disappointed to find this book sparcely packed with unique ideas. Each chapter had a couple of personal stories and very little substance on the actual topic.
4,One of the most helpful wedding books around.,"Believe me. I've read just about every Wedding book out there.Good advice and tips. Example: Organize your guest list by using index cards. Include names, addresses, gifts sent, RSVP, etc.This way you can keep track of everything in one box.Overall, this is a great book."
5,FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,There's only one thing that comes to mind when I talk about creative weddings: FANTASTIC!!!I resently got married to my sexy wife Ann. We loved the way the book gave such creative ideas which inspiered us to have such a Fun and special wedding. If you are planning to have a creative wedding this is the book to read!
2,"For Hardcore, Die-Hard Fantasy Fans Only","This book, as a continuation of the first in the series, only makes me hate almost all of the characters even more, especially the main character, Jo Menhir. I do not recommend either it or the first in the series, The Tainted Blade, unless you are really dedicated to classic D&D novels. It has some good ideas at times, which is what redeems it somewhat, but it also wastes a great deal of time in descriptions and the constant emotional agonizing of the characters rather than getting to the meat of the matter at hand."
4,"Wow, what a quilt!","I really like the book but I would like it better if it had the instructions included for making each block. I also noticed that some of the blocks have been drafted incorrectly...too bad this wasn't noticed prior to publication.On the whole though, the book is still worthwhile purchasing as the details included about Jane Stickle and the pictures of the quilt/blocks are inspiring. What a work of art this quilt is...I wonder how she did it without all the gadgets we have at our fingertips nowadays. A quilt that comes from such a fascinating time like the Civil War is a true treasure! Shipping was very prompt and the book arrived much sooner than estimated."
5,Dear Jane quilt book,"It seems like it took quite a while to get here, but arrived in great shape & I love the book! This is not a beginners book, but I knew that when I ordered it. You get a pic of the original block, & a sketch drawing of the block , in block form, & you are on your own. Have made a few blocks so far, & am enjoying playing with them.."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book thinking it would tell me how to make a reproduction quilt based on the Civil War-era quilt on the cover. It does not. It has a color photo of each block (which is nice), and then a line drawing the author drafted of the block. Many are inaccurate or have mistakes. There are no instructions for making the quilt. The yardage given for the background is wrong, according to the author's website. I had to look up on one of the author's web contributions to find out that the quilt has sashing, and how big to make it. Worst of all, to my mind, the bulk of the book is made up of cutesy diary entries that the author writes to the orginal quilter--long on feelings and short on substance. Finally, the names given to the quilt blocks are modern inventions, given by students in the author's quilting classes. NOT what I was looking for."
4,"Amazing quilt--but to construct it, you'll need more","The Dear Jane quilt is truly an amazing piece of art. I am in awe that someone pieced this back in the 1860s--with no computers, software or blogs to get tips/tutorials from.This book does contain line drawings of every single block/triangle in the quilt. Which means you have to basically deconstruct it to piece it. That means a LOT of tracing and a LOT of cutting of very tiny pieces.This is a long term project I will soon begin--but not without the Dear Jane templates and the software--you can probably do it without those, but it will take a lot longer!"
5,Lovely book,A beautiful book with lots of blocks and inspirations. Use some of the blocks or all of them in lovely quilts. Highly recommended for all quilters.
3,"1st two acts very tense, then last act fell apart","This movie could have been great had they not spoiled it with a terrible ending. The suspense was building and building until they let the air out with a really [bad] ending. This movie was pre-Blair Witch and could have been a lot creepier had they not gone in the wrong direction with the ending. However, some people reviewing really enjoyed the twist ending, so buyer beware."
2,worst ending in history...,"I really wanted to love this movie, and for almost the entire length, I did. I have to admit, it was very intriguing, and had me on the edge of my seat.. until the last 5 or so minutes. Do yourself a favor and stop this movie before the ending. It's how I'm going to watch this one in the future. What a completely horrid way to end the film. To the directors, all I can say is that they had a good thing going, and then blew it. As for the comparisons to Blair, there are a lot of differences. Judge for yourself."
2,Disappointing,"I'll admit--the only reason I saw this film was to see how it compared (or didn't) to BWP. First, let me say that while BW leaves a lot to the imagination, TLB tries to go out of it's way to explain everything. For that reason, I really didn't enjoy the movie as much as I probably could have. The whole documentary-like premise with all of the narraration just didn't scare me. There was a creepy little twist to the plot (those of you who have seen it know what i'm talking about) but the directors could have left it at that and ended the movie there. Bottom line: if you need everything explained to you and handed to you in a neat little package in order for you to understand a movie and be scared, then by all means, see TLB. Otherwise, those who have a vivid imagination should see BW."
2,I Haven't Seen Blair Witch and Now I Don't Think That I Will,"I'm giving this movie 2 stars because I think that it was well made, but ultimately boring. A friend of mine gave it to me to watch and I guess I only have myself to blame: I told him that I've not been sleeping well lately. I fell asleep twice while watching the video so I guess I should be grateful. I won't give anything away but I really get annoyed when a movie ultimately makes no sense. This movie left me feeling very annoyed. As I say above, I haven't seen Blair Witch but if it's anything like this fiasco, I'm not sure if I ever will. I'll wait for the video (due on 10/31/99) and watch it when I need a nap."
5,Thought provoking psychological docu-horror,"All comparisons to the ""Blair Witch Project"" aside, this movie represents what will hopefully be a new approach to movie-making. Presented as a documentary about three men who are killed in the New Jersey Pine Barrens while investigating the Jersey Devil phenomenon, this film will have you guessing all the way to the end. Whereas ""Blair Witch"" is more of a ghostly retelling of the Hansel and Gretel story, this plays out like a murder mystery. The directors use this film to subtly stab everything from the judicial system to the media. Sarcastic, sinister, and highly entertaining."
3,Where have I seen This Film before....,"Like many film goers I found out about this film when the hype for the Blair Witch was at full steam. It took me forever to find a copy to watch it but all i can say is that this was one of the few films that truly spooked me out. I can honestly say the film is not what you would call a Hollywood film and is very much an amatuer film but what a film it is. Shot for less money then what their Sony Digital Video camera may have cost, The Last Broadcast tells the horrific events surrounding the tragic murders of a group of men who went in to the woods looking for the infamous Jersey Devil in the Pine Barrens. Put together as a documentary the film plays along like an old episode of In Search Of as the host seeks answers to a group of brutal murders and the truth behind what really happened. Much more terrifying the Blair Witch, The Last Broadcast would be compared to its contemporary and ironically has generated much more interest to it."
2,"Good, but the ending sank it.","This movie turned out to be nothing like what I expected. The directors do an excellent job of capturing the feel of a PBS-style documentary, and the atmosphere is suitably creepy. The ending, however, really put me off. The first hour and a quarter is in documentary format, then it switches to third person, and what is revealed by this removes all sense from the movie. If that is indeed the case, then why would the documentary have even been made, and why analyze the lost tapes? Mind you, I don't mind being suckered by the directors, but this was too cheesy."
3,"A sharp, funny satire of ""Real Television""","I just had the good fortune to view ""The Last Broadcast"" and, for the most part, was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the filmmaking and satire. The documentary was nicely paced and well structured and the the performances were as top notch as could be expected on a $900 budget. Unfortunately, there is a twist near the end (which I won't reveal) that pulls the viewer right out of the film and wraps everything up a little too nicely. Now, I wasn't expecting a ""Blair Witch"" level of vagueness but the ""twist"" was a little too pat and, honestly, not much of a shocker. Plus, I wish there had been even the slightest bit of explanation as to what the ""Jersey Devil"" was supposed to be. So, not a perfect film, but an interesting curio."
3,Not really like the Blair Witch,"I saw this because I heard it was like the Blair Witch Project. Sorry, it really isn't. Blair Witch leaves a lot of the thinking to you. This movie was inventive, but really, it shouldn't be compared to the Blair Witch Project.This movie, although it was kind of neat and it was inventive, was boring."
2,pretty weak,"Along with all the other critcisms of this film, I had to wonder why there was absolutely NO explanation of the Jersey Devil mythology. If we knew what the Jersey Devil was/is there might have been more interest. Also, part of the effect of BWP was it's focus on the characters interaction. The ""unsolved mysteries"" format of this film took away from the main characters, and made the end project boring and tedious"
1,Not even close to BWP's intensity,"Bought a copy of the tape from Amazon because of the (purported) similarities between it and BWP. Really not that similar. Acting was over-done and really pretty bad. You never got to know/like the characters, so you could care less whether or not they survived. Story line was weak. Wanted to like it, just nothing likeable about it. YMMV, but for my copy, it's off to the auction block."
2,The ending DESTROYS all that came before: BE WARNED!,"This has an intersting premise (forget all the BLAIR WITCH comparisons)and they do an okay job building on the set up.But the end -- the last 10 minutes -- discounts all that went before, so you're left with a bad aftertaste!So rent it -- just to see how bad they screw up -- but don't buy it!"
4,Don't compare it to the Blair Witch,"Honestly like many others, I was caught off guard by an ending that made a complete turn around of the movie. Unfortunatly, due to the makers of the Blair Witch Projects ability to rip off a film completed a year before their production even started the Last Broadcast will forever be compared to a poor movie and live in the shadow of it. The movies shouldn't be compared and if you watch the Last Broadcast with the idea that its similar to Blair Witch, you're likely to miss out. The point of the movie is not to scare you, although it likely will at points, it's making a statement about modern media, and the way it twists the reality of life into entertainment. Keep that in mind and the mockumentary will keep you on the edge of your seat and the ending will bring a greater sense of closure."
1,"B for effort, F for execution","This is a goodnatured bit of amateur filmmaking which had me snoring about an hour into it.Watching ""The Last Broadcast"" left me, too, in a state of contemplation: how best can I direct my desire (and my dollars) to support the new, the independent, the original artistic endeavor? How prone am I to believe in hype?Dig up some birthday home movies instead. It could be that your great Aunt Bessie is the next new thing. Maybe she had an edgy camera style, with a flair for subtly deconstructing pre-feminist family dynamics. Perhaps her unflinching eye for fashion could reveal to you a Mom you never knew: in her skinny days, serving cake in floral capri pants and black-framed glasses, upswept sweaty wispy summer hair looking all the world for something straight out of a 1998 episode of ""Friends"".If I was a film school professor, I'd give this project a B and suggest more classes. Sorry guys!"
1,WORST...MOVIE...EVER,"The fact that this 'film' came before Blair Witch and was made for $900 should have no bearing on your decision to watch, or worse, purchase it. It is quite simply the worst waste of time and film I've seen since taking a college film course. It aspires to some unclear pretension of social commentary, like a community college student's wet dream, but ultimately, like the same wet dream, ends up a sticky mess of grade school writing and sub-amateur camera work. Somebody take the cameras and pens away from these jokers. Watch the Last Broadcast at your peril."
3,Nice companion to BWP,"This is basically a good ""mockumentary"" film and, like The Blair Witch Project, leaves you thinking about it after you're done watching it. The only thing I didn't like was the mechanical pace of the movie. If it whould have been more relaxed in it's presentation instead of being so tight, it wouldn't have looked like a PBS presentation! I mean Dateline shows are more free and easy."
2,"Ok for 95% of time, ruined by ending","This was a watchable but far far far inferior film to TBWP which was ruined by an ending that is pure garbage and shows the lack of true talent on the part of the filmakers. By the way, how about actually mentioning what ... the NJ Devil is??? Guess if they had an extra 25 bucks to add to the budget they could have included this slightly important tidbit."
2,Idiotic ending ruins the whole thing,The movie is actually quite effective at first. There are a few precious moments that are horribly creepy but the ending...oh..the ending is so stupid that it ruins the entire thing.
2,A buildup to a letdown.,"""Blair Witch""-style mocumentary actually succeeds for the first 3 quarters in being creepy and engrossing, then blows it with a truly stupid ""twist"" ending that destroys the audiences suspension of disbelief."
2,Big disappointment,"This movie was an incredible disappointment. After reading numerous reviews portraying this movie to be considerably better than Blair Witch Project, I was quite excited. The Last Broadcast turned out to be nothing more than a low-grade psychological thriller. The makers of Blair Witch Project clearly took notes and improved this entire documentary concept by actually injecting an element on the supernatural. Not only did The Last Broadcast fail to deliver any chills or creepy moments, but it gave virtually no historical background to the story of the Jersey Devil. Furthermore, at no point in the movie was there ever a slice of information which eluded to anything other than human foul play.I feel bad even mentioning The Blair Witch Project in my review, because its an insult to compare the two. Hell, it doesnt even compare to Blair Witch 2. I gave this movie 2 stars merely for the fact that its an indie film."
1,BORING,I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a movie. We just kept waiting and waiting... and waiting for something to happen. I don't want to get into a comparison with The Blair Witch - there's really no need - this movie is terrible with or without TBW. You need more than a good imagination to find anything remotely creepy or scary about this tedious film.
1,The BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME/MONEY,"I saw this movie when it was released in limited theaters, and barring the whole ooh-ahh of it being broadcast digitally, this film is a TOTAL WASTER OF TIME. There are a few similarities to Blair Witch, but this film is just painfully BAD, BAD, BAD. Terrible acting, directing, and photography. JUST DONT WASTE YOUR TIME."
1,I wanted to shoot myself in the head...,"I had the unfortunate experience of witnessing ""The Last Broadcast"" at last year's RESFest in NYC. I've never been so bored in my life. If it hadn't been for the tub of lard sitting next to me & blocking the exit, I would have left the theatre after the first 15 minutes. There are some people that shouldn't make films... these two losers can now populate that category. Save your money and buy some camping gear instead."
1,Horrible Movie,"This movie is utter dreck, don't waste your money or time. This movie has been compared to ""The Blair Witch Project"" but the only thing that is somewhat similar is the shaky camera work, nothing else is similar. This movie has bad acting, horrible dialouge and terribly written characters."
2,"thankfully, the Last Broadcast","Being a resident of NJ I wanted to like this movie. I have long been interested in the legend and mystique of the Pine Barrens and myth of the Jersey Devil. I also heard the hype that this movie was the precursor to the ""Blair Witch Project"". Unfortunalty, this movie isn't nearly as good or intense. It is pretty decent for the first 3/4 where it somewhat successfully emits a documentary feel. But the ending is stupid and the movie and its credibility fall apart with its idiotic and cut and paste conclusion."
3,Interesting - If Unknowing,"Absolutely infuriating movie - if you are unaware of what it is. I caught it on cable five minutes from the beginning. Since it was running on IFC during a Halloween marathon they titled ""Independent Screams"", I could not find out what the title was or what the film was about. I thought it was a documentary and bought into it hook line and sinker. So bravo for fooling me. Infuriating for making me emotionally and mentally involved with what happened to the ""victims"". Not such a good film though if you know it is a fictional movie, not a documentary."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,I bought this movie when I worked in a movie store everyone said it was supposed to be better than Blair Witch. This is the most boring horrible thing I have ever seen. They have a public access show which they want to search for the NJ devil. The movie was just bad nothing exciting at all. Please be warned I wish I would have been.
1,Don't waste your time on this garbage,"I waited for months for this movie to be released on video... what a disappointment! How people can say this is better than Blair Witch is beyond me. This movie was horrible in every aspect, from storyline to the ending. The poor acting almost made it unbearable to watch. As where Blair Witch seemed to be real, this film was totally see-thru. One of the worst films I have ever seen, don't waste your time or money on this junk."
1,Just Disgusting,"The Last Broadcast is a movie that centres around a futile plot, with stock characters. I travelled about 30 minutes just to rent this movie, and it was probably the biggest waste of time in my life. I live in Canada, and since it was only available at hollywood video, I drove down to rent it, because of all the great reviews it had. What I got was the slowest, lamest movie I could ever imagine. This movie is basically only good for people who want to watch a documentary, but, a made up documentary. This movie was NOT scary, it had no plot, and was a farce, as far as acting and storyline were concerned. It is my opinion that anyone out there, thinking that this will be another blair witch project, should just stay away. The scariest part of this movie is it's strange popularity. In short, don't rent it, buy it or look at it, you'll be disappointed for sure."
1,doesn't work,"Despite the hoopla that this was the original 16mm low budget student success, The Last Broadcast falls flat on its behind, even after its creators tried to get the public to compare it directly to the Blair Witch, which was a far mor intelligent film. Another ""dissapearance in the woods"" movie, although this one is presented as a documentary, where pieces of the found film footage are examined by experts and a court of law. Had this movie actually bothered to delve into the legend of the Jersey Devil (which is an actual phenomenon, it may hvae been halfway interesting. The acting is grossly unconvincing, and the plot line is just boring. The film never becomes scary, what with all the courtroom talk, and the ending is just corny, and blatantly ruins whatever atmosphere the film had built upon. Leave this one on the shelf."
2,"Better than Blair Witch???? I DON""T THINK SO, KIDS!!!!!!!","Don't believe the hype, folks. This movie isn't even in the same league as The Blair Witch. I was bored through 85% of the movie, and the ending left me cold and I felt as if I had been ripped off. Blair Witch was great because the movie slowly crept inside your head. This movie tried way too hard to be creepy and just ended up and plain boring. And I also have to agree with the consensus- the acting was HORRIBLE. All in all, the movie was barely ok. To compare it to the Blair Witch is sheer blasphemy!"
2,Shoots itself in the foot with the ending!,"Okay, this was a fairly interesting movie for most of the ways. Although the acting was worse than in your average high school play, it put up an intriguing mystery. And then- SPOILER ALERT - at the end it suddenly stops being a ""documentary"" and turns into a ""movie"", right in time for one of the most sickening murders I've ever seen. It makes no sense, and the movie's final big secret can be seen coming a mile away.Another HUGE complaint: the movie basically assumes that every viewer in the audience knows exactly what the Jersey Devil and the Pine Barrens are. How about some explanation?"
3,It was okay until the end...,"I was curious when I read the summary for this when it popped up on the IFC a week or two ago, sounded like a Blair Witch rip off. But I was determined to see it anyway, so I watched it.It sounds like the same type of movie as Blair Witch when you read the summary, but it's really quite different. I liked it, but loved Blair Witch (the original not the second one) a lot more. This movie was pretty good, and did creep me out a bit when we got to see that last footage those two guys shot.Then, the crappy ending arrived...man was it lame!I'm not going to say anything about that though, you guys can judge it for yourselves. Let's just say...if it weren't for the bad ending, this would have had 4 stars instead."
5,Yes!,These guys definately missed the boat or did they? This should be the 100 million dollar movie or the summer not Lairs itch. This is a thought out well crafted film . And to those reviews who are stating that these young men need to go back to film school are probably babbling spoiled little My father works for paramount fools. I am a film teacher and while the film does feel raw the talent is obvious. Can't wait to see what they do next. At least their doing it!
4,The Last Broadcast is frightingly realistic film.,"'The Last Broadcast' is a psuedo-dockumentary that incorporates reality TV and horror, and delivers a frightenly realistic film which builds a web of suspense that lasts all the way until the end. The camparison between this film and 'The Blair Witch Project' are strikingly similar and do warrant suspicion. But this film is far superior in it's style, and plot. Do not settle for second best. 'The Last Broadcast' is worth watching again and again."
3,"Alittle slow, but overall good story","The Last Broadcast is a little shoddy in it's presentation, but it did scare me and it was a good story. The plot development was pretty slow, and I could definetly see people turning this movie off halfway through..... but don't. The story does get quite interesting towards the end. Being from New Jersey, I have camped out in the Pine Barrens and it is a pretty spooky place. It was a perfect setting for a movie of this kind. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars overall"
3,"for a cheap art film, it's not bad. But it ain't great","I head so much about this movie around the same time Blair Witch was coming out. I live in New Jersey right outside Philadelphia and was pretty curious about a movie involving the New Jersey Devil. The first 80 minutes of this movie were pretty good. It was gritty and raw enough to be very convincing. However, the suprise ending comes out of nowhere and really has no place in the matter. Not only does it not make sense but it forces you to discount everything you saw up to that point. Had the last few minutes been cut off, maybe re-edited or something, they might have a cult classic on their hands, instead this movie just comes up short. The DVD is decent though... with some cool extras, the commentary wasn't that great though... those guys seem pretty stuck up... which just ...me off.."
1,overrated no-budget amateurism,"Don't be fooled by the comparisons to Blair Witch -although I wasn't too pleased by that movie either, ""Last Broadcast"" is much worse. The only interesting stuff on the DVD are the behind the scenes documentaries in which the film makers talk about the distribution and production of this no-budget failure.As for the film itself: it's dull (with a very annoying voice-over explaining every useless detail at least three times), and horribly filmed. If you're familair with Adobe's PhotoShop software, you will recognize the overdose of cheap graphic effects that should give the film some modern hi-tech look, but doesn't add anything to the (lack of) storyline.Made as an amateur movie, the filmmakers should have keep it that way. Let's hope not too many people will feel inspired by the Blair Witch Project and copycat the idea."
1,This movie is simply a horrible load of junk.,"Just saw the movie last night. I have NO idea how anyone could possibly think this movie is decent. The acting was terribly unbelievable, we get no reason to care about ANY of the actors, and there's NO motivation for what happens at the end.Why would this guy make a documentary on himself? Why would these morons drag two CRT's three miles into the woods, and have a live internet & television broadcast, but no equipment to do so? Why can't they type URL's right?It's quite obvious this movie was made by a few computer geeks doing nothing but showing off the editing equipment that was actually used for the movie. The whole IRC thing? HAHAHA. God that was stupid."
5,Thrilling at every turn of the page!,"I throughly enjoyed reading of the perilous journey in which Haise, Lovell and Swigert had to overcome. The suspense is paramount and from the third person it seems as thoguh you were there, in the action. A must read for anyone who saw the movie or want to gain a better understanding of space travel."
5,WOW!,"This book was compelling to the end. The author gives a detailed description and makes everything clear. I would definitely recommend it to everyone out there. Not only does it portray the story of Apollo 13, but gives a great deal of backround information. The story is riveting, and you will want to read it again and again. This book seems a bit intimidating at first but you will begin to sink into it and enjoy the whole trip."
5,ABSOLUTELY MESMERIZING,"Exciting, thorough, meticulously written and explained. Its not so hard to understand why these astronauts were called 'heroes'. They wore that badge well."
4,"An amazing story of stamina, ingenuity, and heroism.","You think you know what happened aboard Apollo 13 because you saw the movie?! I don't think so. This book goes beyond the news reports and Hollywood embellishments to give you a cockpit's view of the spacecraft's hair-raising ride. Lovell and his co-author Kruger let you see the problems as the crew saw them, as Mission Control saw them, and as a nation saw them. It answers all the questions you may have had, makes you ask more, and then answers those. The authors show the fear, stamina, and true heroism of those intrically involved in the mission without the unnnecessary heart-wrenching of the film, which is based upon this book. They give you the facts as known by those on the mission, then translate to give any reader a clear idea of the feelings and actions of the crew and ground support. The book will inspire any reader, and give him faith in humanity."
3,"fantastic premise, intriguing moments...but incomprehensible","Philip K. Dick (PKD) certainly wrote a lot of very original science fiction novels and short stories. Unfortunately much of works is decidedly uneven. 'The Pentultimate Truth' is not one of PKD's better works, but it does have its moments.The story has a great premise. WW III has come, and the populace is driven underground to work as slave labour for the war effort. But after fifteen years the folks underground are being pushed to the limit and the truth comes out about what is happening on the surface ... and it isn't what they thought (of course). PKD does a fine job with the overall plotting and his observations of human greed for power and how the media can distort reality are brilliant. But sadly, PKD clutters up the story with too much techno verbage and confusing banter between the characters.Bottom line: intriguing, diverting, but often times confusing. For PKD fans only."
3,Woolly Dick,"Better-than-average Dick, wild and woolly, packed with too many ideas that never add up, but with enough originality to fuel 10 novels"
4,great read,I loved this book! It was the first I've read by PKD and was surprised by how engaging and relevant it was. A must read!
4,Reminds me of the Fallout Games,"Being a fan of Philip K. Dick, especially Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (aka Blade Runner), I had to check out this novel. The characters were memorable, the story stayed with me long after I closed the book and the story was well-done. It's a very scary thought to think that after countries wage war and humanity are like ants underground in hives while the ""men"" have ceased fire years ago. I remembered playing the Fallout video games when I was younger so this story resonated with me. An interesting idea. Dick is a grand master of painting strange, eerie, yet familiar worlds and placing the reader into the minds of regular every-day people in these strange dystopian worlds. I would recommend this book to fans of Philip K. Dick, people who enjoy pulp sci-fi and the Fallout video games."
3,Dated and a bit shallow,"Given that it was written in the 1960s, it is somewhat quaint to read what the author had envisioned happening in our current time, but even if I had picked this up 45 years ago, I would probably have been a bit disappointed by the ending which leaves a lot of plot points hanging and the rather shallow way the characters are drawn. The only thing that kept me reading to the end was the hope for greater resolution and Dick's very vivid and imaginative descriptions."
3,"A little dated, but still good","This is a short book (~190 pages) but I think any fan of speculative fiction or science fiction should read this book for context. Written in 1964, it is pretty interesting the things Dick speculated might be the future. I was a little put off by the characters, none of which were very likable really. But still, a decent read."
5,Another must-read from Elaine Biech!,"Frankly, marketing has always been a challenge for me. I tend to capitalize on what's right in front of me rather than visualize what could be, so Elaine's step-by-step instructions for marketing have been invaluable."
3,Finding Your Target Market in IT Consulting,"In IT Consulting, we are often specialists in a particular discipline or technology, but rather unfocused or agnostic with respect to industry or vertical market. When developing a Marketing Plan, it's critical to identify who your target market is. To that end, I've been examining my list of current and past projects here [[...]]. As far as I can tell, they have absolutely nothing in common, aside from the fact that I was involved. They span industries, sizes, geographic locations, business models, and technologies used. Many of them are no longer in business. Is examining past successes a poor approach in determining your target market for future growth? How can you focus on a target market narrowly enough to effectively reach your audience, but not at the expense of other opportunities?"
5,"Eye-, Ear- and Time-opening experience","It sounds like a cliche, but there is nothing remotely like Sonata 7 in the catalog. Yet, despite its length (three hours), it is easy to take and has the effect on the mind of intense meditation. You will come away from this Sonata moved and changed for the better. Give it a listen. Amid the welter of works being composed these days, here is one that has staying power."
3,How to Bring Balance to your Body's Energy System,"The illustrations provided in this book on how to enhance the spiritual process are very worthwhile. Some of the illustrations show you how to combine sound (vowels), with specific postures and breathing. If you are at all familiar with sound therapy, this book is very much like sound therapy, only better. This book discusses sound therapy, but combines sound with movement and breathing. The actual explanations of esoteric philosophy will bog the reader down very quickly and I did not find it of much practical use. However, I do recommend this book for its illustrations and explanations on how to balance and restore energy, as well as how to enhance and accelerate spiritual consciousness."
3,"The Harmonics of Sound, Color, and Vibration","The first part of the book gives an overview of the effects of sound and color on the human body and psyche. The author traces the history and development of the philosophy through the Eastern, Western, Oriental, and Tibetan schools, then discusses its influence in terms of ""radiant bodies"" upon the physical bodies. The second and bulk of the book discusses practical applications in the form of various exercises, including yogic and breathing postures.Recommended for anyone interested in learning about this branch of self-awareness and how to apply it for achieving well being."
5,This is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.,I can hardly wait to start growing my bonsai potato. I wish I had sent this to my sister before she sent it to me!
2,Joke wears a little thin,"Let's face it, this instant Zen thing is funny. But once you've shelled out the bucks for the kit, you may find yourself wondering why you bothered. You're never really going to understand Bonsai by sprouting a potato. You might learn something about Zen somewhere down the road, but I wouldn't count on it. If it was this simple, all elementary school teachers would be Bodhisattvas and their students, enlightened masters. No, this is pretty much a joke, and a good one, too, but in the end it's a lot of money to pay for something that's going to leave you with a rotting potato and a bunch of bored friends who have heard the joke a few dozen times. You could go to the supermarket and get a sweet potato and do the same thing for far less."
1,"So many piano players, so little time ............","There are so many great piano players recording today, why listen to a second-rate one?Philip Aaberg is the giant of the present day. But let me point you towards someone you've probably never heard of : Alicia Bessette (dotcom), especially her first cd ""Reservoir""."
2,Flimsy and Uncomfortable,"Ordered through work as my standard desktop keyboard. First impression...cheap. Way too light, button layout is odd..seems too tightly laid out. Volume control failed to work.Going to throw this in a drawer and re-install my Logitech."
4,An Affordable Option,"I payed $10 for this board and it's an excellent value at the price. The keys are slim and press relatively well, although they don't feel as nice as those of more expensive keyboards. This is a minor complaint against an otherwise solid product. The layout is satisfactory and it only takes minutes to adjust to the key feeling. The Multimedia keys at the top are a nice addition, as is the volume wheel. Build quality seems sufficient despite the cheap plastic. My only concern is how long the unit will last, but at this point I've found it to be an excellent low price option."
3,takes getting used to,"the keys are a bit shallow, which takes a little to get used to. fingers sometimes slip and dont hit the right key or a key at all. but its slick, has all the buttons you need, a great volume wheel, and was a great price."
1,This stuff is not good for you,"There should be a warning on how long you can take this..also there should be a warning that this may cause heart problems. Because of the caffeine in this vitamin i now have heart problems.. the caffeine in it caused me to have pre atrial contraction and pre ventricular contraction, my doctor said it was caused from caffeine. i have drank coke 0 for years so thats not where the caffeine came from. This drug should be taken off of the market. I may end up in a pacemaker over this"
5,"For seekers, the best essay in existence",The Supreme Spiritual Ideal is the simplest and most profound essay I have ever read. It speaks of the author's simple straw house in Japan and compares it to the massive buildings of London. They turn out to be humble metaphors for a cosmic reality brought down to earth. Lovely.
5,"The new ""artcore""style of D'n'B at its best; mellow smooth","If you are looking for some hardstepping dance beats, you will be disappointed. But if you are looking for some chilled rythms to lose yourself in, this promising look into the ""artcore"" style of D'n'B is a must have. Ambient enough to cut the edge off of the common repetitive beats of D'n'B, but hittin' enough to keep your full attention."
2,Wrong audio samples,"As someone else pointed out, there are two artcore albums on Amazon, and Amazon seems to have mixed them up. I ordered this CD solely for the rare Joy Electric track ""Transylvania"", but that is not on this CD.Still not a horrible mistake to make though. I'm not really into DNB, but this is at least listenable."
4,Better then most of the newer vocalists,"Secret HeartMr. Stigers does an admirable job with the standards on this album. While not possessing a smooth voice, it does contain a sincere emotional presence. I certainly enjoy his voice over some overhyped (and over recorded) names, e.g., Steve Tyrell. Mr. Stigers contemporary numbers were also very enjoyable. It was a very good mix of contemporary and standards(6 each). My only regret is that it took me too many years to 'discover' his recordings."
5,Gets better and better..,"I adore this cd, and have seen Curtis Stigers live several times during 2002. I also had a chance to see him sing some new material at Brighton, UK on February 14, 2003, when he performed with the amazingly talented Stacey Kent (if you've never heard of her, GO .. check her out) in a live broadcast for BBC Radio2. We were treated to several tracks from ""Secret Heart"" and a stunning performance of ""When I Fall In Love"", that Nat King Cole classic. I also urge anyone out there with chance to see Mr. S. to grab it, one day tickets will be like gold-dust!I've been around from the very beginning also, and as one other reviewer has stated, without this influence from Curtis returning to his jazz roots I would never have been drawn towards the world of jazz, now I cannot get enough - Stacey Kent being another bright light for the future.Enjoy .. new cd should be out in the spring of 2003 and a tour to follow!"
5,Loved It!,I rarely ever get a CD where I like all of the songs. This was one of those CD's. I love it and could listen to it all day. They did a great job!
5,Album of the year!!!!!!!!!,I think that nimrod is the best album of the year it has all the type of green day there is it starts out fast with nice guys finish last and slows down with hitchin a ride then goes mello with the grouch and redundant and then picks it right back up with scatterd and you have to love time of your life and king for a day they are songs that make the album what is and should be album of the year.
4,Punk Lives In These Three Guys,"This Green Day album, while not like any before it, is still a punk classic. The trio have put together a fabulus cd that stretches the boundaries of punk. From the acoustic and moving ""Good Riddance"" to the funny ""Prosthetic Head"" the band makes their mark. My personal faves from this one include the truthful and hurtful ""Nice Guys Finish Last"" about how we really do; and the bitter ""The Grouch"" about aging not-quite so gracefully. All in all an excellent album."
5,one of there best,"greetingsi have been i gday fans since '98.this is a great album and people who say it sucks are nimrods themselves. And are just looking for some one to take there anger out on. the ones that say that green day has no musical talent, i say compared to who? Jimmy Page, Jimmy Hendrix, Angus Young Slash or Eddie Van Halen? you might be right there. but compared to 50cent or ja-rule or any other ""pop-Punk"" as they call it band they are supremes. Any way comparing billie joe and jimmy page whould be like comparing chips to ice cream they are different.any way i heard this album first in 1998 in a car. this cd has it all, a ballad a ""gothic"" song some ""pop"" and some good rock.this album is also full of humor. ""i was a young boy tha had big plans. now im just anouther sh*tty old man"". ""i heard your sick sucked on that cancer stick. a throbbing tumor and radiation high."" and many others. my favorite songs are pltypus nice guys finish last redundant and the grouch."
5,5 Million chinese can't be wrong!,"Which is exactly a little saying i'd like to use to ""CRUSH"" the myth that Green Day is merely a fly-by-night-band. Green Day has stood the test of time and they have the fan base to prove it! Nimrod is an amazing piece of work..some of their finest. And to also de-bunk a negative review of Green Day fans, here's a quote by #erik+""Since Green Day fans live in a protective bubble from the outside world (you'll never find a fan over 21 and/or living on their own."" OK..#1 you're wrong, i am 23...and #2 you're wrong..i have lived on my own since i was 19..i own a house to be exact. So before you go making accusations against fans of the greatest punk rock band ever...do some research. You're facts have tons of holes in them!-JRT"
2,whats the deal with these guys,"Green Day really puzzles me sometimes. Their early stuff is pretty true to their punk roots, but their newer stuff really dives into the alternative realm. Songs like good ridents really stray unforgivably far from their roots."
5,"Great, high-energy songs","I'm going back and rediscovering old Green Day after enjoying their International Superhits for a couple years. This album is solid top to bottom, with great familiar tracks like ""Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)"" and ""Nice Guys Finish Last,"" but also there's the fun ""King For A Day"" and ""Platypus (I Hate You)"" ... basically, if you like Green Day's pop-punk sound, there's no reason you shouldn't own this album."
5,Their best... without a doubt,"Green Day rocks! As much as my musical tastes expand, I always come back to Green Day no matter what. Since my musical tastes are constantly expanding, Nimrod has become my favorite Green Day album and I still would argue with anyone that this is their finest work to date.Even though their music is considered 'pop punk' by most (I always thought of them as rock, cuz when I was 9 I didn't know what punk was), they show their 70s punk influences on this album, mainly the Clash. They show their aggressive hardcore punk side, their normal side (infectious pop-punk), acoustic music, straightforward rock ballads, an instrumental, and ska. Nimrod contains some of Green Day's best songs, awesome instrumentation, and it took a lot of audacity to make a record like this, since it's usually against punk rock ethics, but since Green Day was already rejected by the 'punk' community by signing to a major label, the best thing they could've done was make this incredible album."
4,The Best They Have Made,"When Green Day came out with the album ""Dookie"" I never thought they could top that album and make a better one, but then Nimrod came. I first bought this album and started listening to it and it sounded like one of their earlier albums like slappy hours. It has a mixture of different styles of music from punk to softer rock. This is one of their best cd's yet and it is a good one to own."
5,Another great Green Day CD,"This in short, is just an awesome cd. My personal favorite on this CD is either ""Scattered"" or ""Prostethic Head"". This also has Green Day's most popular and overplayed song in the history of Green Day ""Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)"". Dont get me wrong, thats a wonderful song that shows Green Day's (and Billie Joe's) more mellow side, but it is so ridiculously overplayed it's awful. I wouldnt reccomend getting this CD if ""Good Riddance"" (or ""When I Come Around"" from 1994's Dookie) is the only song you've heard by them, or if you dont like songs about stupid things (like cross dressers; I.E. ""King For A Day"" Reason being, you might be disappointed that the rest of their songs arent like ""Good Riddance"". If you are just a surface fan, ""International Superhits!"" is the Green Day CD for you."
4,"Not as good as dookie, but a must buy",Nimrod is certainly not as good as green days previous cd's. It's one of those cd's you listen to a few times and get tired of. It's not as pure as dookie but if u are a true green day fan it's a must buy!
5,Who ARE those people on the front & back cover....,"It's the 8th wonder of the world...well anyway, that was a joke. This CD is great, I've had it for 2 yrs...I wish Green Day would make more music...I love all 5 of their CDs. If this is the only album you have, or you only have 1 or 2 of Green Day, buy the others NOW!!!"
5,From someone who gives a damn about their music,"This CD was the best GD has ever writin, I hella liked the song the grouch, and Jinx. I do think that this CD should have had one of those black box warnings to show that they are talkin' how they talk."
4,GREEN DAY'S WEAKEST ALBUM BUT STILL GOOD,"THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT SONGS ON THIS ALBUM. SOME OF GREEN DAY'S FINEST. HOWEVER, THIS ALBUM AS A WHOLE IS GREEN DAY'S WEAKEST PERIOD. ACTUALLY I HAVEN'T HEARD THEIR VERY FIRST ONE BEFORE KURPLUNK SO I DON'T KNOW. BACK ON TRACK HERE PEOPLE. COMPARED TO DOOKIE, INSOMNIAC, WARNING AND AMERICAN IDIOT THIS IS THEIR WEAKEST PERIOD. NO DEBATES HERE. LIKE I SAID THOUGH, STILL A LOT OF GREAT SONGS ON THIS ALBUM. GREEN DAY DOES NOT HAVE A BAD ALBUM."
1,"hail Green Day, pioneers of punk!!","This CD is the best, fellow dudes. I love it so much, it made my Punk girlfriend fall in love with me. Billie Joe is a genious!! ""Good Riddence(time of your life)"" is a terrific ballad. I can even play it on my guitar!! The lyrics make me cry. ""Nice Guys finish list"" proves these guys the saviors of punk. The best thing is, this CD is approved by the godfather of punk, Carson Daily. His show on MTV is THE BEST. There are so many punk chicks out there that diss poser punk like pennywise. I just wanted to say CARSON, I LOVE YOU, MAN!! I LOVE YOU SO FRICKING HARD!! Anyways, if you don't get this CD, you aren't a real punker, DUDE!! PUNK OUT!!"
1,Brilliant...,"Someting tells me that the Pistols, the Ramones, the loathsome Green Day, and the rest of the genre could have achieved as much musically if they had been playing car horns and trash cans as opposed to musical instruments. Do you self-deluded ""rebels"" really think that punk was about liberation and freedom? It was about finding a new way of separating a bunch of gullible, immature fools from their money. Mission accomplished.""Pogo On Dudes!"" Duh."
1,Horrible....Horrible.....Horrible,My God! This cd sounds like it was made in one day. Green day's knowledge of variety of chords is ridiculous...They are the same songs in different variations...The words are incoherant and unimaginative...I think i'll throw this in the garbage and pop my Bad Religion tapes back in
2,very displeasing,"im a major GREEN DAY fan i think that nimrod was not one of their best it sounds more like soft beat ""grouch"" is the best song on the cd"
2,Nimrod and it shows!,"I hate this album because it is sooo unfocused. Green Day is all over the place musically with this album and that weakens it to a certain extent to me because no matter how great a band you are there are just some genres of music you will be weak at. Also I do and can see showing musical diversity on a single album but only if one does it well, Green Day doesn't. Not worth buying, unless one wants a CD that looks cool when burning."
5,My favorite CD,"A classic! This is one of the best, most innovative Cd's to come from Green day, or any artist for that matter. Nimrod offers a variety of music styles. From the sarcastic humorous ""Grouch"", to the ballad ""Good Riddance"", to the horn-driven ""King for a day"". There isn't a bad song on the CD.Nice Guys Finish Last - 8.6Hitchin A Ride - 8.6The Grouch - 10Redundant - 9.8Scattered - 8.1All the time - 7.9Worry Rock - 9Platypus (I hate you) - 6.5Uptight - 9.3Last Ride In - 6.7Jinx - 8Haushinka - 9.6Walking Alone - 9.4Reject - 9.2Take Back - 8King for a day - 8.2Good Riddance (Time of your life) - 9.5Prosthetic head - 10"
3,Hello...Punk...Where are you?,"What happened to the punk? Is it just me or did Green Day used to be a punk rock band? Don't get me wrong, Green Day is a very talented band with a wide range of sound but i bought this album thinking i was about to hear some agressive guitar with some clever lyrics. There are still signs of the old Green Day in this album, but i see the start of a new Green Day happening and they just don't please my ears the way they once did. Well Green Day you made a good album, but I will miss the old guys. Bottom line a good album, but if you have grown to like/love the old ""dookie"" style of things you best steer clear of this one."
5,Nimrod is best.,"Nimrod is a mixture of all the CD's styles. It has pure punk rock like 1,039 Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, Kerplunk, and Dookie. Hard Punk like Insomniac, and the laid back pop-rock of Warning. Any Green Day fan must buy this CD."
5,real music,"Dookie was good and this is even better. Nimrod has it all together. From slow, ""Good Riddance"" to fast and hard ""Platypus"" and ""Take Back"". ""The Grouch"" is hilarious but not to be taken seriously. This ranks right up there with Offspring and Everclear. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THEIR NEXT ALBUM."
4,green day is the best band ever!!!!!!,"green day has always been the best, but this cd makes metelica sound like elevator music. it is 18 awsome songs!! you'll get hooked on listening!!!!!!"
1,1 song worth listening to out of 18 isn't good odds...,"It is true that ""Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)"" is one of the top 5 songs of all-time, but there is not a single other good song on this CD.Whenever I buy a CD, I listen to each and every track, but the hour [approx.] that I spent doing that for this album was a waste of my time, and afterwards I had one thought, ""Those valuable 60 min. were completely wasted and now I can never get them back""I would much rather have bought the single than waste my money on the other 17 songs...PS--it starts to be a pain to have to skip through the first 16 tracks to get to the CD's only good song..."
1,DON'T BUY THIS CD,THIS CD BLOWS. GREEN DAY ISN'T PUNK ANYMORE. IF U LIKE GREEN DAY'S OLD MUSIC DON'T BUY THIS CD. DOOKIE IS SO MUCH BETTER CUZ IT'S ACTUALLY PUNK.
1,The name says it all!!,Why do bands like this keep churning out the same old polished pseudo punk trash?! The album is appropriately titled for those who wish to purchase it!!!
1,"No, no, anything but this!","""Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)"" gets my vote for the worst ballad of the decade."
5,best ever,"this is the best ever cd buy green day.It is a good alubm cause of such songs as nice guys finsh last,hitchin'a ride,the Grouch and good riddance(time of your life). I hope you guys pick up the album and these other ablums. rage agiants the machines the battle of los aneles,our lady peace clumsy and happiness is not a fish you can catch,the offspring americana and mattew good band beautiful midnight."
3,GREEN DAY HAS CHANGED!!!!!!,"From INSOMNIAC to NIMROD GREEN DAY has CHANGED!!!!!!!! My favorite song on NIMROD is HICHIN A RIDE!!! I hope on GREEN DAY'S next album they go back sounding like what they did on DOOKIE, and INSOMNIAC!!!!!!!"
3,"Good, But They've Done Better","I must admit, I did like this CD, however it is not their best stuff. It can't be measured up to Dookie. It just can't. It really can not measure up to Insomniac that well either. A lot of the songs were the same things from past albums or from this album just recycled. However songs like Hitchin a Ride, The Grouch, and Good Riddance kept me listening and coming back for more. I really would give it 3 1/2 stars, but I can't do that."
3,"""Dead skin on trial...""","Nimrod by Green Day is a good album but not their best. Songs like Nice Guys Finish Lasts, Redundant, Time of Your Life, and Hitchin' A Ride were some of the songs released from this album, all are very good and catchy. The rest of the tracks are ok but too short and pointless. American Idiot is a fantastic album, I recommend that one instead."
3,"Becoming a ""Nimrod""","On ""Nimrod"", Green Day becomes almost prophetic, seemingly predicting the rise of Limp Biskit and other groups with nothing on their mind but selling albums by swearing as much as possible. The angst on this album, compared to ""Dookie"" seems forced and overdone. However, ""Last Ride In"" is a strong instremental, while ""Good Ridance (Time of Your Life)"" is a very strong piece. Not horrible, but not classic either"
4,It was really GOOD!,It was really fantastic. I listen to it all the time and GREENDAY RULE!!!!!!!!All the songs are great and funny
5,Ive been a great fan of GD and continue to be......,"Green Day is awesome. I listen to the bass alone because its genious. I dont care about all the people who want a parental advisory. Ive had it since Sept 15 1997 and will keep it forever. sorry to go, but ""my toungue is swelling up"" (heehee) SOLIDBUGG"
3,Pretty Godd but should have a Parental Advisory.,"Now I must be honest, the tunes on this C.D. were very cool like, Time Of Your Life, Nice Guys Finish Last, and Redundant. But geeze!!! They say the F word like 20 times and it doesnt have a Parental Advisory???? My parents got this for me cause I really liked Time of Your Life and when I read the lyrics, I came up to endless trash mouthing. Especially on The Grouch! Little Kids shouldnt be exposed to this music!"
2,Wearing out,"2 1/2Perhaps their last offering with an inkling of old-school zest, Nimrod nonetheless succumbs to mediocrity with a bland second side."
2,green day nimrod,Well first I have to say I am not into green day's old stuff. Anyways so I bought this cd from best buy and when I got home got it on my ipod nano 4g. So I started listening to it and thought that it take some time to get used to but it has been a year of constantly trying to listen to it and I think its just good. Sure I found three songs I really liked but nothing else I could really relate of have fun with listening to. Anyways I would not get nimrod if you like 21st century breakdown.
3,Buy 1039 or Insomniac instead,"""Haushinka,"" ""Hitchin' a Ride,"" ""Grouch,"" ""Reject,"" and ""All the Time"" are the only songs I flat-out love on Nimrod. ""Haushinka"" is actually an outtake from Kerplunk. It was a live staple for a few shows back in 1992. The fact that the song uses the verse guitar riff from ""Paper Lanterns"" as its solo hints at which era of Green Day's career the song is from. By the way, the word ""haushinka"" means ""queer"" in Japanese. I have to be in a certain mood to listen to rest... except for ""Platypus"" and ""Take Back,"" which are the stupidest songs Billie Joe has ever written. Buy Green Day's debut or Insomniac instead. At least those are consistantly catchy/fast-paced."
3,By far the weakest Green Day record,"I've, at one point in my life, had all of the Green Day albums in my posession, and I definitely have to say that this album let me down. The first 4-6 songs on the album are good, but as it goes on the songs just become faceless. The riffs aren't as catchy as those found on 1039, Kerplunk, or Dookie, and aren't near as biting as those found on Insomniac. Time of your life was a good radio song, but couldn't redeem the overall blandness of this album. It's okay though, because Green Day picked right back up with their next release, 2000's ""Warning"". Nimrod is just weak, and could be left out of any Green Day collection leaving the listener satisfied, without the feeling of being raped of their 15 bucks."
2,Nimrod - Green Day,"I am a huge Green Day fan. I have been listening to them for at least 12 years. I absolutely love their music. But I was thoroughly unimpressed with this album. Many of the songs sounded the same, and I was bored, and I could barely listen to the album the whole way through. There are great songs on the album (Nice Guys Finish Last, Hitchin' A Ride, Redundant, Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)), but I would much rather listen to Dookie or American Idiot than this album. If you are only going to buy one Green Day album, I would say ""do NOT make it this one!"""
2,there's only one good song,"good riddance is the only good song on hear the rest is crap , if you've never bought a green day album don't start now I would'nt recomend any albums by green day."
3,like it with some reservations,"Bought this for my 10-year-old, who's a Green Day fan. We both like it, but I was not happy to hear some four-letter words and wished I had had some warning on that. The message is not really bad, as with other music that parents often object to (i.e. rap), but just would have appreciated being forewarned."
1,Green Day: worst band of all time,"Time of your life is the most retarted song I've ever heard. This album just sucks, period. It's made up of several monotonous power chords repeated over and over it's boring and predictable. Not to meantion the lead singer's voice is annoying and whiny... It's not worth the time or money."
4,Sometimes I still feel I'm Walking Alone...,"Great album that could be better without 2 or 3 songs. But there are highlights all over the record like Nice Guys Finish Last, The Grouch, Haushinka, Good Riddance (Time of Your Life) and my personal favourite the unforgettable Walking Alone."
4,best album of greenday,i really think this is the best album of greenday im not really into punk but them basterds drug me into with all there great song on this cd i mean this album got it alltop 5 songs(not in order of importance)1.time of your life2.nice guys finsih last3.all the time4.reject5.the grouch
5,"For only $13 bucks I get 18 songs, I love 15 of them","I just wanted to get the single, Time of Your Life. The clerk told me it cost so much because it was an import, it only had 2 songs on it. I get the full cd and I can't turn it of. Just beacuse of a few bad words, I don't care. The beat is awesome, same with the rhythem. Songs that are awesome, take a while to list: Nice Guys Finish Last Hitching' A Ride The Grouch***** (It rules!) Redundant Scattered All the Time Worry Rock Last Ride In Haushinka Walking Alone Reject Take BackKing For a Day Good Riddance (Time or your Life)***** Prosthetic Head*******"
5,WoW!!!,"I liked this cd right from the start.My biggest favorites are Hitchin' a Ride,Prosthetic Head, Reject, Scattered and of course Haushinka who acually is from the Dookie days. But it never made it to the album. Anyway this version is better then the one on the Dookie demo.These songs is really diffrent from one and other.. I love all of them very much and it is one of the best Green Day albums ever!!!"
5,Green Day makes another classic,"Just like Dookie and Insomniac, this is a classic. After those CD's, they sort of steered away from punk and made Nimrod a more alternative rock CD, which I think was an extremely wise move. This CD is probably their best songwriting than on any other Green Day CD. Not to mention, like Insomniac, it's in the angry league. Don't be fooled by ""Time of Your Life"", this CD is a angry, foul-mouthed hard alternative record, but if you do get it, you won't regret it.Best songs: Every song, with the exception of ""Scattered"", is equally good, so every song other than the formentioned is my favorite song."
3,Mixed Feelings,"While its still a very good cd, Nimrod is not a representation of Green Day. I listen to this and Im thinking is this the three guys squatting in California? Or is it elevator music. In the same way that Americana is an ok CD yet its so soft. While Good Riddance is very well done (and I suspect about suicide). It is not punk. Buy this if you like ""Alternative"" Rock. Punk fans should stick to Dookie, Smash and Out Come The Wolves...."
4,....READ HERE...,"...After the same old stuff in Insomiac, Green Day must have sensed that their music was getting monotonous and needed a little diversity, a little experimentation, a little change. And Nimrod is as good as it gets for their aims.In Nimrod, Green Day starts trying new things and with good results. Tracks like 'Hitchin' A ride,' 'Redundant,' etc represent a new age in Green Day. AN age of greater depth and sound. They slow things down more, have different chord progressions, etc.Overall a good show, recommended, and do not forget Dookie..."
5,I think it's great!,"I love this CD. I have all the CD's, and this one is the best in my opinion for several reasons. The main one is, that it varies a lot from vocals to hardcore punk to instrumental. Nice one. I can't wait for the next one!"
4,great cd,"i'm not giving it 5 stars even though it was very temping to... because the song writing could be a tab bit more creative. i mean, they don't have to swear in almost every song (esp. grouch...good song,but i would never do a song like that for saturday night kareoke. get my point?)i've never heard the meaning of ""king of a day"" used before...awkward though ;)but..it has great music for any person who loves punk rock. just look beyond the profanity and you'll see a great cd!trust me!"
5,Wow,This CD is great i dont really like this type of punk music but green day has a unusual talent to make people who like mellow music love their songs
5,Wish i had known you guys earlier!,"The first and the best Green Day album I ever listened to! Man, it was a waste of time listening to New Found Glory and Good Charlotte and all those other ""junk"" rock bands! It was very stupid of me not listening to Green Day just because they were "" too famous""!"
5,Me Likey!,"This is Green Day's best yet. Lotta songs. Instruments like horns and harmonica give some variety. I think some of the best songs are Jinx, Walking Alone,The Grouch,and Reject.In the cover Tre Cool is wearing the coolest shirt ever made, which is a reason to buy the CD in itself. Definetly worth the money."
3,Good. Green Day get fun again.,"This is the 3rd best Green Day album (after Dookie and Insomniac.) If you listen to Dookie, then Insomniac, and then Nimrod, you will find that Green Day have gone back to their roots. Insomniac was great, but the lyrics were nastier and the music was more heavy metal tinged. With Nimrod, Green Day have gone back to being a fun alternative band. Nimrod is a pretty good album. I recommend it.-Matt Laird"
1,SELLOUTSELLOUTSELLOUT!,dont make the mistake i wasnt stupid enouff to make myself i lisnt to it i hated it.
4,Pretty good,"Nimrod is a very good album by Green day. It has alot of good songs.My favorite and what i think is one of their greatest songs ""time of your life"" and it is the best one on the cd. It is overall a decent Green day album."
4,Great Vocals and beats,I got this cd before I was interested in music but as I grew up I discovered how good it was. Nimrod is one Green Days best! I found it amazing how they can go from headbanging rock to emotional alternative. This cd contains Green Day's most popular song Time of Your Life. All in all its a great cd except for all of the swearing but if you really listen its really called for.
2,Disappointed,"I loved these stories when I was a teenager - we called them ""how comes."" Because of that I was anxious to receive this booklet. When I read them I found most to be way too eclectic to even begin asking questions. That was disappointing. Perhaps it was just this volume. At $10 for 20 pages, seems quite pricey. I will not give up, though and I will try another volume - hopefully one with solutions that make more sense."
3,Not for sensitive stomachs,"Our husky began teething, and we decided we needed to get her something to chew on apart from socks, underwear, and furniture as all of these were apparently more interesting than her toys. Embedded flavor seemed like it would be great to keep her interest, and it did. We supervised her carefully and she never broke off pieces larger than a grain of rice. Diarrhea was an almost immediate result and took her 3 days to recover. While the product itself seems great (she loved it, it kept her busy, and was fairly durable), it's definitely not something to give to a dog with a sensitive tummy."
3,Be careful,"My puppy has had a couple of these bones, and I don't recommend them. She can chew the ends of them down quite quickly (and she isn't a large breed puppy), so I can only let her have one for ten or fifteen minutes at a time if I want it to last longer than a few days. The Nylabone puppy fish toys are a few dollars more, but are more durable and have lasted much longer."
4,Great Bone but Wish I got a larger one,"Our dog loves her bone and it's a really great product, but when we leave her in her crate it falls through the cracks of the crate onto the floor. I would have preferred a larger bone even though I bought the size appropriate for my puppy. Other than that it is a great product and I recommend it."
1,Don't Trust This Author,"The author of this book is an inmate at the Utah State Prison, incarcerated under a second-degree murder charge for beating his first wife to death. That doesn't seem like the sort of person who is credible, and his other works demonstrate a lack of credibility. If you want to read about Joseph Smith, learn from people like Richard Bushman or Donna Hill who are beyond reproach."
5,Works fine - Fine wire!,"This product works well and is very practical. In order to make the wire a good length and roll up well, they had to make the wire fairly thin (it's also very tough considering it's fine diameter). So - be warned - if your receptical is close to the steering wheel on the right side, don't leave it plugged in and talk on the left side of your head while turning a corner or you'll get a big surprise! It really does work well in all other cases. Good job, Callet!"
3,Bait and switch,"This product was advertised as a Cellet brand, and I read some favorable reviews about it, but the product that arrived was not a Cellet; the seller decided to substitute another brand.I haven't yet used the product so I can't say whether it's equal in quality to the Cellet brand, but I'm very disappointed in getting something different than I agreed to buy."
1,Defective - It over heats and may damage the battery,"After 15 minutes of charging, the charger gets extremely hot, I had to unplug it. The same day hours later my phone was getting warm and battery got empty much faster than usual.DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM"
1,Poorly made,"The quality of the charger is so poor that it only worked without flaw once.1. The 1st time I used it I had no problems.2. The second time I used it, the blue light didn't come on until I pulled the extension cord to the end.3. The third time I used it, I did what was in step 2, but the plastic casing that housed the charger split open because the manufacturer didn't glue it together... and the Palm Treo charging light never went on...I just threw it away. It's just a really shabby charger... one time use only."
1,Not compatible with 755p,"I bought this charger and after a few times, the light blinked off and on while charging my 755p, meaning that it wasn't charging at all. I emailed and got a new one sent to me, and same problem! I'm convinced it's that the charger is not compatible with the 755p, and therefore is not making the proper connection inside the phone to charge it. Don't order this charge if you have a 755p, it won't work!"
2,"Cheap Price, Cheap Quality","I am always looking for compact solutions for charging my Palm Centro. This looked like a good choice. It is still working electrically, but no longer retracts. The retracting action quit working after my 5 year old did some experimentation with it. I figure it should last more than 4 weeks even with a 5 year handler.It now resides in my car with the wire extended permanently."
3,"Decent item, but not as pictured.","Although the items I received are similar, they are NOT the Cellet units as pictured. However, they work and seem OK for the price so I am not returning them (shipping would be more than the price originally)."
1,Customer Svc.,I happened to click on the wrong item. eg:the wrong end connectionI haven't been able to send this incorrect item back an get an exchange.No one wants to take responseabilty for an replacement.I am not happy.
1,disappointed,I bought two of these pyle subs. 1 blew the first day or was already blown when it was sent. i guess you get what you pay for. they have a one year warranty but they charge 15 dollars for shipping and what not. well that's 7 dollars less than what the subs cost. i wont' buy another pyle product.
1,terrible speaker,This speaker is not worth the money at all you pay like $18 and you get your $18 bucks of crap.The cone in the speaker is made of plastic and u have to force it to move and it ratels a ton.
1,bad product,i received it with the wire to the coil pulled out and the cone torn.had it repaired but just doesnt push any real bass
1,JUNK,"PLAIN AND SIMPLE THESE SPEAKERS ARE JUNKCHEAP PRICE CHEAP SOUND, SPEAKERS SUPPOSETO BE SUB WOOFERS BUT HAVE NO BASS AT ALLYOU GET MORE BASS OUT OF A SET OF 6 X 9 REARDECK SPEAKERS"
4,Hard kicking subwoofer,"I have had this 15in pyle woofer for about a month, Its a good woofer, I have a autotek 1000w amp and the pyle is hitting hard, and I like the rubber surroundings, I was once told, if you want a good 15in woofer to make sure it has rubber surroundings, I guess its for durable high performance woofers, So if you order this sub you are getting your moneys worth and more, a great sub amazon......P.S. (PLAY THEM LOAD)."
2,"good sound, bad QC","i attempted to have a pair of these in a jensen bandpass box, but after hooking them up i found out 1 was dead out of the box. all it does is rattle. pyle used to be really good, but now not so much. oh, and these subs are severely ovcer rated, i can easilly max them out with a rockford fosgate punch 4040dsm in unbridged mode, which is rated at 20w a channel. i know the amp is under reated, but not by that much. so betwene one dead out of the box, and the over rating, 2*, only because the one that works sounds good."
4,Good and cheap.,Don't expect to compete in spl contests with these speakers. Remember you get what you pay for. I needed these for my set up I have in the shop I work at. They are cheap and sound good enough over the din of power tools. If you need cheap subs with minimal power I would recommend these.
1,Crap,Spider to stiff subs rms is onle 300 and way to stiff I burned up the coil the first day I got it and have Bin installing car audio for meney years.
5,I'm in love,"I bought these speakers not for a car but to replace my older 10"" woofers for my home stereo. As soon as I put them in the boxes I instantly fell in love with them. I can't even push them to there capacity and I honestly don't want to. For there price they are some of the best subs I have ever had. They work great in small and medium rooms."
5,Sounds Great,I bought this sub to replace one of a set that accidentally got punctured (badly). I Love it. It sounds great !
1,CRAP!!!!!!!!,"I bought this speaker a little over a month ago and it already blew on me so after talking to amazon they issued a replacement speaker. connected it to my system which is powered by a 760 watt 2 channel amp and already has one 600 watt sub, non bridged so max output per channel should be around 380/ channel. the replacement speaker blew almost immediately so am now waiting on a refund for the original purchase price. ordered a boss 10' 800 w max hopefully it works much better then this did. bottom line is PYLE truly stands for PYLE OF CRAP.Save your time buy something else."
3,only buy if you want something simple for cheap,"This is not an impressive sub; however, it will put out some bass at a cheap price. I got it for my wife who does not listen to ""bass-rich"" music and it deffinately rounds out the sound nicely. It is a good buy for putting together something cheap. I am dissapointed with its frequency responce though. Doesn't get the super low tones."
3,good looks no bass,i got 2 of the subs and they have no bass power at all they look very good but why have looks with no kick so i just hid 2 bumpin subs and have these for display
5,Works Great!!!,Remember too research before you buy. Know how much power you got before you buy these cause if you put too much to them and don't match the ohms your asking for bad results. Or a broken speaker. But its a good product for the price.
3,Eh.,"This is just 'okay' at best. You get what you pay for, basically, so I'd recommend just paying the extra money to get better one."
1,the worse,i got this speaker only because of the previous reviews. i hooked it up and after bumpin' for a while the thing just started rattling and broke down i wouldn't recommend it to anyone its very poor quality!>:|
1,Definitely a Pyle,"There is no doubt that this speaker is a Pyle...Pyle of crap that is.Worked for about 20 mins although it sounded like crap then died and sent my amp into safe mode.I was pushing it with a 350w Kenwood bridged and putting out only 150w rms.Oh well, what should I expect for $14, right?"
2,Not what i expected,"Received on time. They work just not well, better off buying some that are a few dollars more. Misleading Watts output, says 600w, no where near. Magnet says 70oz, yet my 32oz. pioneer sub has more weight. Might be able to handle 75-100w rms. Muddy bass, distorted mids, horrible highs. Better off picking something else."
1,About ready to throw it in the trash.,"Hooked it up in my car and got this horrible crackling sound. Swapped it out with another subwoofer to see if it was a wiring problem, but it worked just fine.I was about ready to throw this sub in the trash, sounds absolutely horrible. Might just be the speaker I received, although it looks fine, but I'm not even going to go through the trouble to return it, not worth it."
1,Look elsewhere for a sub,"I bought this for a replacement speaker for an old 10"" bazooka tube. Horrible buzzing sound and low output. I might have had a bad speaker, but can't return this as I have already marked up the frame installing with screws. My loss."
5,PLW10BL,"Build a box to the correct volume for this sub, put it in a hatchback and it sounds AMAZING.I've got a 400W amp (200W RMS) pushing this sub, and it sounds, and feels, like I've got a 1000W system.This cheap sub is definitely a head turner."
4,Pretty good,It wont rattle any nuts off your vehicle but has a great sound and thumps pretty good for me anyways.
5,power,I had to hook up a equalizer so I wouldn't get kicked out of my neighborhood ... the bass was so deep.
2,its not that good...i was displeased,"doesnt even show the RMS!!! thats the most important part! anyways i bought this as an experiment, and im unhappy. cuz i like a mean subwoofer, first off it rattles and it cant hit the lows that well. but if you like mediocre bass go for it...its not bad but its not great either"
1,Dead in under a week.,"It sounded amazing for about 3 days and then the positive and negative wires broke from inside the sub. ""If"" this sub was better built I would give it 5 stars and highly recommend it. I would say, try your luck and see if you get one with better soldered wires. I'm upgrading to the Kenwood KFC-W2512 10-Inch, 1000-Watt Subwoofer. A lot more money, but extremely well built."
1,Not worth the money,"I was looking for a sub that was a good boom for the buck. I'm gonna have to keep looking, because this sub blew after three weeks. I only had 300 watts hooked up to it!!!It wasnt that great anyways, I had hoped for a deeper bass and there was also an ""airy"" sound to the acoustics.I will never buy anything from Pyle again. The name fits the product. POS.Move on and look for something better, you get what you pay for."
4,Good speakers for the price.,I would definitely recommend these speakers.-They were easy to install.-A perfect match for factory replacement in Cadillac Deville.-Good sound quality and bass response.
2,Collector's only,"I am a collector of Blue Demon and Santo movies so I am happy to have this release. However, the movie itself is terrible and difficult to sit through, and the DVD release is of very poor quality. For non-Spanish speakers, there are no subtitles. The actual transfer of the movie to DVD was not done well, and the sound is terrible with a large amount of hiss and background noise in the audio track. Some of the dialogue is hard to discern because of the poor quality.If you are looking for a better Blue Demon solo movie, check out Blue Demon contra las invasoras, or Blue Demon contra los cerebros infernales. If you must see all of his movies, then get this but don't expect much."
1,Not what I expected in the least,"As an athletic trainer, I purchased the book for another source in dealing with my athletes and their injuries. I am always looking for summaries of injuries that I might present to them that will put them at ease and help them understand the treatment protocols. I found that too much information was outdated in the book, which kinda goes along with the people who it is meant for. The book did mention plenty of common injuries, however, I would not tell my friends or family some of the treatments given in the book. Most being behind the times, and speaking of behind the times, some of the Locker Room Lingo used is ways outdated, get with the times."
4,Smells good but,"The package arrived finally yesterday and I went to my parents to go pick it up. The smell is really good and I would recommend it, but it looks bigger in the picture. Because of this I'd personally recommend purchasing locally to be able to gauge how much it is you're actually getting. This will of course still last you months."
3,Won't run on Mac Computer. So I sent it back. It was presented as able to run on a Mac.,Presented online as being able to run on a Mac Computer. That is what I was looking for. Since it won't do what I expected I sent it back for refund.
5,Excellent product,I had no problems installing it on a 35 year old Columbia Tandem bike. I mounted the shifter on the rear handlebars and it works great.
4,"decent ride, good bargain / not guaranteed","This mounted up nicely and shifts very well. It is easy to adjust.I turned and old schwinn world sport into a simple, zippy little bike.However my wheel may have come damaged, out of whack. It seems to have some excess frictioneven after meticulous adjusting of the cones.The brake is strong, but there is some excess noise in the gears from time to time(which the manual does say can happen .)However the manual also says the parts are not guaranteed under normal use.Overall a good deal if you are into 3 speeds w/ a coaster brake."
3,"5 stars for Joan, 1 for the rest = 3 stars","This is a very bad film about a private investigater who's involved in a kidnapping scheme. It's a foreign film so the lips don't exactly match the words and our 'hero' looks like a blond haired Sony Bono who had one too many trips to the deli. I won't give away the plot too much, but the movie has a surprise ending as to who the culprit really is.OK so the only reason anyone would watch or purchase this is for Joan Collins, so here we go. She first appears as a burlesque dancer at a popular club. We get a nude scene as she flashes her ta tas at the end of her routine. Her final scene of the movie, she is forced to strip down to her bra and panties at gunpoint by our hero. She is eventually shot by an unknown assailant just as she's about to give him the information he needs.She's on the cover, but she's only in about 15% of the movie. She looks good though and makes every scene count."
3,Classy Miss Collins,"Initially this movie probably had a lot of potential, but annoying dubbing (Italian to English), horrible editing, terrible lighting, and questionable acting makes it all go downhill. However the saving grace is JOAN COLLINS!!! Miss Collins manages to not only look fabulous, but brings life and some dignity to a shaky script.The story revolves around an Italian detective who inadverdently uncovers a prostitution ring of young girls in Austria,and his quest to find out who is responsible for the death of one of them. This puts him in contact with Miss Collins and a few other unscrupulous characters along the way, which culminates in a surprise ending. Please note that this movie is also known as ""Fatal Charms"" and ""Magnum Cop.""Despite the weak script, laced with corny jokes that always seem to miss the beat, the classy Miss Collins manages to portray her character with credibility. If you are a true Joan Collins fan, this movie should be a treat."
2,TIred of being tired,"Joan Collins is an actress who not only was sexy, she played characters that were trying (too hard?) to be sexy. When you go 'over the top' and do truly outlandish things to get notice, you know you better rethink things. Joan is gorgeous and timeless; however, her figure 'best if seen by' date was about 20 years before this movie. Joan did a guest bit on Space 1999 with Martin Landau; she was breathtaking then, in face and figure. This movie is years later, with the actress playing a broken down oversexed woman. It is a role that not even Anthony Newley, her ex-hubby, would appreciate."
5,There is nothing that could be said about this report,"This report, as well as the previous did, summarizes the current knowledge about an ever-growing issue. The guidelines provided in the report are usually regarded as canon for physicians and researchers as well. This report is freely available (as a PDF file) in this direction: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/hypertension/jnc6.pdf; however, at the prize displayed, it could be convenient to purchase it from Amazon."
2,lively mix that still disappoints,"This twelve song disc contains classics like Corcovado, Girl From Ipanema, How Insensitive, and Wave. Byrd is a fine guitar player and the addition of guest Ken Peplowski helps, but there really isn't anything new here. By that I mean there are no real variations or reimagining of these timeless songs. But what is there is a lively mix, just not one that sets it apart from other bossa nova collections. Sound quality is good but not what I've come to expect from a sacd. Certainly not in the same league as Getz/Gilberto. However it is a hybrid so it can be played anywhere."
2,Mediocre and not really money well spent,"I've read quite a few basketball drill books and since I am now coaching a girls' team I thought I would brush up on my knowledge base before the season started. I bought 5 books and this one was the worst of those. To be honest the diagrams are not good, there are many mistakes and the drills are not always explained thoroughly. Also, since there are several coaches that contributed to this book you can find the same drills listed again but with a different name. Not a well-written book. If you are thinking about a drills oriented book or one on general coaching (both x's and o's and teaching technique like shooting form, defense, etc.) I would suggest buying ""The Complete Guide to Coaching Girls' Basketball"" by Sylvia Hatchell. A much better book and for about the same price."
5,good text,"Good approach to studying the Tao--I am learning the original Chinese meanings, and expanding my knowledge of this masterpiece of world thought."
2,"A guide? No, just a word-per-word translation","This book is screaming to the author - do not publish me yet! Give me a little bit more of your time!This is a word-for-word translation of the famous classic. Every character (unfortunately its a simplified version that is given) is translated and given a common prononciation.Below is a translation of the whole phrase.What is missing? Everything else. When I buy a ""GUIDE to Reading Tao Te Ching"" I buy something that will be ""guiding"" me - explaining, discussing hard-to-understand things, giving me a literary, phylosophical and historical notes, meanings, etc, etc, etc.This one is a quickie job over something that deserves a lot of attention and devotion. Tao Te Ching and superficiality are not a good combination.Is it useful? Yes, to some extent it is. Was my hopes satisfied? Not at all.Alex Chaihorsky."
4,"Quebec was better, but yea",If any Ween album had the word Beatles on the cover of the CD you know it would be a top 100 album no doubt.
5,Instant Classic,If you do not like this album you are not a real Ween fan therefore you should stop trying.
2,not for first-time Weeners,"This album will scare away potential Ween fans. ""Punk"" is the first word that comes to mind to describe this album. The Ween brothers are very talented, much more than this album showcases. If you want the REAL Ween experience, get Chocolate and Cheese (far and away the best Ween album). Period."
3,A tough place to be Weened,"As some have suggested this is not the place to start to engauge in the all-everything inferno of music that is Ween. This album is a retrospective listening. One can hear how this whole crazy and beautiful thing we know as Ween got started. Much like the quazi-punks that are the Flaming Lips, Ween took a few or so albums to become the lush music making machine they are. Simply put, this is not very mature Ween, but its not without its rewards. I have come to love Ween...but did so from about 2004, then worked my way up and back. Up was better, but this is still good too. There are times now, given my musical mood for the day, that I would put Ween in my top ten. This album is like an appetizer for things to come, not nearly as tasty as the main course, but satisfying none the less."
3,Realistic,"I admire the storyline as there were some really crazy parts in the film. I mostly appreciated that the ending was realistic. As humans, we do not always have the answers and we just have to try to work through it without hurting each other too much. I suppose some things will happen, but we must try to limit the hurt and love."
3,An emotional black hole,"Rabbit hole is the story of hope and coping after a tragedy. A couple, Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart try to pick up the pieces of their life, while trying to keep their sanity and marriage intact after the loss of their son about eight months earlier. A very subtle film but deeply emotional and poignant in the pain that this tragedy has inflicted on this couple. Hard to watch at times because of the grief and sadness involved. Three stars."
4,"Great acting, but really depressing","I did not know what to expect when I picked up this movie from the Red Box. Truth be told, it was pretty much the only thing I hadn't seen that wasn't rated R.This is the story of a husband and wife dealing with the grief of losing their four year son, and those in their lives. Now, I've got a teenager myself but this got me really thinking of the blessing it is to have a son who is alive and relatively healthy. So this did have a very strong emotional impact for me.The acting by Nichole Kidman and Aaron Eckert were fantastic as you could, throughout the movie, see the weight of their son's death carried by them. Masterful!One thing I wish they had established earlier in the film was the boy that Kidman's character starts stalking at the beginning of the movie. I won't blow anything because I'm wondering if the director had made it mysterious on purpose, but I was personally very confused for quite some time."
5,Take it Slow. It doesn't need to be Faster.,"I was amazed that I found this so engrossing. It's slow. There are no melodramatics. But the depth of feelings, of irrevocable loss, and the need to carry on, carry this on totally. Miraculously, the writers and/or director didn't take the easy way out, that of rage. Spouses don't abandon each other in their grief, nor do they encourage each other's sadness, although they acknowledge it. Brilliantly acted, wonderfully written, this is what drama is supposed to be: about the vicissitudes of life, (If you're looking for an action movie or one loaded with angst, this is not for you.) If you're looking for an excellent drama, this is. And it's not just a chick flick. My husband was as absorbed in it as I was, and we both felt the need to discuss it afterwards."
1,Theres not much to this movie,"I don't really know what the other reviewers saw that I didn'tsee, but I must say I was disappointed with this movie. It neverreally took off. The movie in my opinion needs work.The beginning is really slow and the ending is awful."
3,Living with loss,"This was probably pretty well done, but before you start watching ask yourself if you REALLY want to spend an hour or so with a couple who have lost their young boy (he ran into the street chasing his dog and was hit by a car). Because that is ALL this movie is.If you're a psychology major and want a better understanding of people experiencing loss, this might give you insight as to how some might react. If you know someone who has experienced a loss of their only child and want to understand a little better what they might be going through, then this movie might be helpful.Otherwise, it's simply depressing. Watch something else that makes you want to ""live"" - something inspiring or at least entertaining. Life is too precious to waste grieving via a movie."
3,The Acting Was Great but...,The movie seemed to drag on a bit before explaining what actually happened to their son. I liked it good enough but nothing special.
5,Very well done,"I have seen this movie several times with family and friends. No movie, play, novel, or any other type of literature can touch upon every complex issue of losing your only child. This movie did however relay in very realistic manner the bigger picture of this type of grief. Great actors that acted great in this film was comforting for me. There is however nothing that can truly comfort a parent who has lost their child or provide any magical answers to the ""why did this happen"". This is a great movie that was well researched but it is not reality. The reality aspect of this movie is unbearable at times. In loving memory of my beautiful Son, I will see you again someday. Your loving Father"
2,"no conflict, no resolution","this movie has a plot - boy is killed and parents struggle to find themselves again. However, no one could possibly ever get over the loss of a child.The movie went on and on featuring their daily struggles but there was no build up towards any conflict. It just sort of.... ended. Who wants to watch people grieve for 1.5 hours? I took nothing away from this film other than the fact that the loss of a child bears no greater pain on Earth (but everybody already knows that)."
2,Not What It Could Have Been,I was really looking forward to this movie. It sounded so good i bought it. It was not even close to as good as i was expecting. It wasn't the actor's faults. I feel the writing could have been mush deeper and explored more . I wish i had only rented it.
1,A sleeper...literally.,"I'm certainly not immune to loss, but this movie had me sleeping 30 minutes into it. I tried watching it again due to the wonderful reviews here, but still could not see what others saw. It felt like I'd watched this movie several times before. The acting is decent, but the storyline was weak. I think ""The Sweet Hereafter"" dealt with the loss of a child on a more meaningful level than this movie did. I wouldn't recommend this movie at all."
1,Don't watch this movie unless you have 1.5 hours to throw away!,"This movie is awful!!!! If you must watch it, download it for free just don't buy or rent it! Nothing happens in this movie..."
1,Why Pay good cash money to feel sad ?,I don't understand why I should pay to feel bad ... Given small budgets for time and money these days I think I need to read reviews closely.
3,"Sensitive, but you'll forget it the next day","Nicole Kidman does a decent job as a grieving mother who lost her young boy in a car accident. Her co-star is okay, too, as the dad who is getting a little upset that she is taking so long to get over things. He thinks about straying, but decides he can't. There's not a lot of action in this family drama. Unless you're a parent, you may not find this very entertaining."
5,GREAT BOOK,This is a great Blues Clues book and it keeps my son entertained with tons of little peek-a-boo flaps!! It is sturdy and it has the one and only STEVE!
5,AWESOME BOOK!,This book is Great! My son is two and loves blue so when he got this book he immediatley started looking through it flipping the flaps. The illustrations are so bright and realistic! It is just like watching the show but instead your solving them in the book which is very hands on. I highly recommend this book!
5,Let's Play Blue's Clues,"At 19 months, Jaylon absolutely LOVES this book. Anyone that enjoys the Blue's Clues series will find this book delightful as you play your own game of Blue's Clues. Magenta, Salt and Pepper, Pail and Shovel, they're all there. Even though this book has taken a beaten and some of the flaps are barely hanging in, this is an all time favorite."
2,Who in the heck is Kevin,I bought this book used. The adult in the story was Kevin. Looked like Steven in the striped green shirt but who is Kevin? I finally decided it might be an English version. I put it away it was just too confusing to my child
5,Great book!,"For those who care, this one features Steve. It's also very big.Like all flap books, an adult should 'prep' the flaps before handing the book over. My 2-year-old son loves this book, although he has ripped out a couple of the flaps, and doesn't quite get the point of some. It also has some cues for adult participation: for example, when you open the flap with Blue's ball behind it, on the back of the flap it says ""Now can you find Blue?"" - although this is somewhat circular since the flap with Blue asks to find Blue's ball."
4,Very Concise and to the Point!!,"Lancom did a great job of keeping the reader's interest up, by not writing useless information and having 'never ending paragraphs'that so many other books have done. The review questions have been a very good study guide and follow the Novell CNA objectives thoroughly! Lancom's support has also been very very helpful! They answer any questions you may have clearly, and more importantly, very quickly!! They don't keep you hanging on a question after you've already written the exam!!The book is layed out in a way that allows you from keeping study notes. The book is interesting in that they (Lancom) have explained concepts and ideas in detail, yet keep the main ideas summarized at the end of each section! Therefore, you just need to use the text notes as your study notes! I highly recommend this book to anyone taking their Netware CNA Exam!!!!"
1,Awful Book,"This book was awful. The writer double talks at every possible time. He uses a lot of filler and overdoes the work. It was like he was just sitting around at a coffee shop and just talking with some of his friends and asked per example: What do you know about Client 32?...and then he proceeded to write what he said. It is not well structured and he jumps from point to point and there is no continuity. The book could also have page numbers the ""Roman Numeral"" concept does not work very well, it gets confusing."
4,Above Average,"I enjoyed the music and the performances. But,honestly, I've heard better. Still for anyone who is not familiar with this genre of music, I would trustingly recommend it."
5,Great Punk Album!,"BND's debut release from Tribunal couldn't be better! It truly is an original record in an age when it's so easy for bands of their genre to mimic the overused pop-driven three chord formulas of the mainstream punk bands. They incorporated influences from punk, emo, hardcore, and the newly dubbed ""scremo"". Maybe We Should Run shows that these boys are destined for big things!"
2,cat dozer,"Not what was expected.It is a static display only. It will not operate on the ground as I thought it would. It runs well and makes lots of sounds, but it sits on a stand. Kids lost intrest in about 10 minutes"
3,Not-so-good EP,"Constantines bring great sound to their cds but this ep is not very good, it only has 3 songs, the songs are ok but they don't have that great sound that their LPS have, overall this ep is not worth buying unless you really like Constantines and you enjoy buying cds like me :)"
5,Music history will remember The Constantines fondly.,"At first The Constantines may seem too simplistic, perhaps even monotonous to some, however, after giving the album a chance i was addicted to it. its all i listened to for weeks! can i get a witness? Melodic, gentle, rythmic, heavy, abstract, all at once! The Constantines disply a wide musical spectrum combined with incredible lyrics and instrumental genius. Certainly one of my favorites. BUY THIS ALBUM!"
1,FAX DRUM,"I received the FAX drum but it did not work. The machine growled at me. Not being a FAX machine geek, I took the machine to several places to see if I had installed the drum wrong or see if infact it was defective. The gears on the drum were frozen or in a bind and would not turn. I sent several e-mails to the Golden Brick but never received a reply. I am returning the drum to Amazon because I can not get an address for The Golden Brick. Needless to say, I will not purchase anything The Golden Brick has for sale in the future."
2,So excited...only to be disappointed :(,"I purchased this sled as a Christmas gift to my son. I received the item in a timely manner, however, the sled was damaged in multiple areas. The seller only packaged the sled in a black plastic bag and it offered zero protection for the sled. After contacting the seller, who was courteous and understanding, and notifying them of this they told me that they couldn't put the sled in an actual box without charging more for shipping for an oversized package fee. They then refunded my money.The sled itself seems to be somewhat durable yet flimsy at the same time. It seems like it would go over snow fairly easily but any excessive use would ultimately break it in a heartbeat.If anyone wants to purchase this sled then I would highly recommend them purchasing it from a company that will ship it in a box to keep it protected. A black bag is not justifiable protection for a thin plastic sled."
5,Great Sled,"This is an excellent sled. The design gives you more control over it than with a lot of other plastic sleds. There are two handles for control and to help you hold on on those wild rides! It's very durable, great for active kids or adults!"
1,Not even durable enough for a child!,"Purchased for Christmas, first time out the end of January and it literally broke in half the first time sledding downhill! My 12yr old 72lb son was on it and didn't even get to use it a 2nd time. Would ask for a refund if I thought it was worth the trouble of fighting them for it! Would not recommend to anyone!"
2,Didn't last very long.,This sled was a birthday present for my 13 year old son. He was thrilled on that early December day. We finally got a chance to use it on Dec 26th. He only weighs 60 lbs but the sled was cracked in 2 different places in less than an hour. This is very disappointing... especially for the price we paid. After this sled broke we resorted to sledding on those $6 roll up pieces of plastic and had a great time. And they didn't crack. I will attempt to get a replacement or a refund on this Paricon Winter Heat sled.
2,Looked Used,"I have ordered may products via Amazon and this is the first time I am not happy....this toboggan arrived in poor condition. I am unable to give it as a gift as intended due to the used appearance. Do not intend to order from the company Paricon,Inc again."
1,Broke on the first run...,"We were very disapointed with this sled. We bought it to take our two year old sledding. On the very first run my husband went down it broke! The whole handle and side piece. My husband isn't overweight (6'1"" - 180lbs), so we were really bummed that it broke right away. We then bought a cheap $11 one from Ace Hardware and that has lasted multiple trips, sometimes with three moms on it!"
4,liked,"Did not come black, came red, but did not have time to send it back. Was a Christmas gift. The grandkids saidthey had fun on it Christmas day and it's still in one piece, so that's a plus. They are roudy 5 year old and 2 year old."
3,snow sled,"While the sled itself is heavy duty, the genuine plastic brakes lasted exactly a minute and that was with my grandson just holding on. He didn't even pull to brake. Next time I'll look for a sled with rope to hold onto."
2,Got random color (not as pictured),"We haven't had a chance to use the sled yet, but it looks sturdy and friends of ours have the same model and are happy with it. Still, i am disappointed that we got a RED sled when the product image is BLACK. I ordered this sled on purpose because i didn't want any bright color, but at this price it's easier to keep the color i don't want than mail it back at my own cost."
1,came broken,had to returnbrake was broken off yet not in packageadditionally the sled was filthy filthy filthy filthy filthy filthy filthy filthy filthy filthy filthyfilthy filthy filthy filthy filthy filthy filthy filthy filthy filthy filthyfilthy filthy filthy filthy filthy filthy filthy filthy filthy filthy filthy
2,Good if you've never written anything ever before,"If you have never written anything, in any genre, in any format, then this book would be an excellent tool to help develop your writing skills. However, as a book on screenwriting, this book gives the very basic of basics. That is, to sum up 97 pages of text, you need to have characters, a plot, conflict, a resolution. Oh, yeah, and it all has to make sense.Each concept is ""delved"" into in about two to three pages. Most of this, however, is just primer to the Analysis Section in the back of the book, where the writer now explains how all those elements take place in various movies he considers Good.Not a great book."
3,Verbose but thoughtful advice,"Nothing new here and it is wordy. You should read it carefully, underliner in hand, to mark fishing grounds worth remembering."
5,One-stop text for understanding the workings of memory.,"Invaluble as a one-stop text for clinicians seeking to understand the dynamics of memory in and out of the therapuetic arena. Useful as a reference for researchers, attourneys and judges. Memory research, Trauma Treatment and legal cases pertaining to the false memory controversy and current memory science are all critically reviewed. The authors cover issues in the recovered memory debate, as well as research on the emotion and memory, flashback memory, autobiographical memory, and memory for trauma. Memory recovery through hypnosis is discussed along with current practice of phase oriented trauma treatment. This book is an invaluble reference."
2,Jaw length too short for lobster,"Length:: 0:50 MinsPros:- sturdy with just a little flex- not slippery to hold when wetCons:- short jaw length doesn't work for lobster clawsI was excited to try out this cracker on lobsters here in New England. The cracker works great for the arms, but not for the large claw. The jaw length is too short so the spacer ends up punching a rectangular hole in the claw without cracking it much. Probably works great for crab legs, but not good for lobster.I haven't tried cracking nuts with it yet, but it seems sturdy enough for the job.If you found this review helpful, let me know with your vote below."
3,not for cracking crab,When it is crab season in the Pacific Northwest we enjoy it often. I wanted to replace our old metal nutcrackers.I was disappointed in these as they broke the crab shell in to small pieces that got in to the crab meat. These may work better with lobster and that is why I gave them 3 stars instead of 2.
5,Serious Crackers,"I have never seen crackers so rugged. These are extremely high quality crackers, you could probably crush metal with these beasts. If you have a huge feast or are big into cooking don't even question or look elsewhere these are top notch."
3,Hmmmm,"At times my heart goes out to the author; other times she angers me. She is insecure and lacks self-confidence: early on, her world revolves around her husband and she doesn't make a move without his ""seal of approval."" On the other hand, back in the late 50's and early 60's, when many women stayed home, she worked, not for money, but rather for self-gratification. She and her husband have a ""loveless"" marriage, yet she is clearly racked with guilt at the thought of divorcing him.Perhaps what bothers me so much is how true it still rings today. So many women, in spite of successful professional careers, continue to struggle with feelings of guilt for leaving children home with the baby sitter, for being ""bad"" wives, etc. How sad!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time Or Money,"This book is a completely dull, self indulgent utter waste of time and money, even if you ""got it for a penny"". Not once does this woman go through anything even vaguely resembling struggle or personal growth.Her ""memories"" consist of name dropping and the brand names of assorted knick-knacks that decorate the various apartments in which she lives.There is nothing remotely interesting about this book or this woman, and she does NOT bring New York to life.Save your money."
3,"If you are a writer, and love New York, you will LOVE this book. If you are NOT a writer, and love New York, you will LIKE this","I LOVE NEW YORK! That is why I read this book. However, Mary Cantwell is a writer and I am not. Sometimes it can be hard to follow bc she is very descriptive. Lots of run-on sentences, but if you don't mind that, you will not mind digging a little to get to the meat of the story. I'm glad that I read this book bc I feel like I know more about New York. If I had it to do over again, I would have just read the LAST half of this book, and Mary's NEXT book, bc that is where her life really started to get interesting. My interest in New York is what got me through the first half of this book. All in all I did enjoy the book."
4,much unknown,"Cosmic rays are something that the general public has heard of, but typically has no idea what it is. Well, Clay hopes to dispel some of that ignorance in this brief text. He explains that these are nuclei often travelling at very high speeds; often several percent of the speed of light. Just being nuclei, without any accompanying electrons, means that they are highly charged.Which gives rise to the experimental methods to detect and study them. Ranging from balloons carrying detectors high in the atmosphere to ground-based detectors. The experimental aspect of this field can be somewhat colourful.But where do they come from? Why so energetic? He goes into several possible explanations. Possibly from stellar reactions deeper in the galaxy. But it is contentious as to what those reactions are. Some cosmic rays are known to come from our Sun, and give us insight into its structure and composition.Much is still unknown in this field."
1,These Little Boys have no Talent,I recently bought this album and I have to admit that I have heard better. Nsync has proved a major point: its easy for guys who can't play musical intruments to jump aroung and lip synch.
1,I think that this cd was very stupid,I thought that this cd was the worst cd i have ever listned to I would not even think of listning to it again even if you paid me. this is almost as stupid as the other cd's they have.
5,I LOVE NSYNC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:),"nsync is the greatest ever! i adore them ssooooooooooooo much im thier #1 fan in perryton,Texas! They are the coolest! if only they would come for a concert here and meet me and my best friend! I LOVE JUSTIN&CHRIS!!! they are da bomb! if only! love ya all! Rachel Read"
5,KATHY GARCIA FROM CALIFORNIA /MARCH-20-1999,"HEARD IT, LOVED IT, BOUGHT IT. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT 'N SYNC IS INCREDIBLY TALENTED AND THEY HAVE PROVED IT AGAIN WITH THIS CD. I ESPECIALLY LOVE THE REMIX. INCREDIBLE DANCE MUSIC. YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY."
5,The best song yet!!!!!,I just got this C.D. and I thought it was the best song ever. It has a much different beat than the other songs and the guys all sound really different. The fourth version was deffinately the best!!!!! I love *NSYNC!!!!!
5,If there was one song that would show how great NSYNC was it,I have the imported winter album and it is on their and I fell in love with that song right away. It soon became my second favorite song (my favorite is a song that Chris sings) and now I listen to the cd everyday it is worth the money.arp_roses
5,Why isn't this a US release?,"This is a great import! It's really upbeat and it's got a lot of attitude in it. Infact, I can see the facial expressions they make singing it. I really wonder why this wasn't a US release. I think it would have done wonderfully on radio. Buy this."
5,This CD is great!!!,Wow. I just got this CD today. I love it! I listened to it over and over. I love the diffrent versions too! There's 4 and each one is different and great in it's own way!Definately worth the money.
5,"Unpretentious, Unfiltered Debut Album!","I find this CD exceptional and unpretentious. Overall, I like every track contained therein, but I must admit that tracks 003 and 016 (1630 and We Are Watching the Sky, respectively)always set me in a nostagic mood. The CD is pure and simple, and if listened to in an undistracting environment, subtle nuances and temporic changes can be very rewarding. I highly recommend this CD. Money well-spent!!!!!"
2,Bought this after a friend recommended it,"But...I really didn't like it. It looked cute in it's little sachet, but that was about it for me. I found myself not wanting to ever have it even if it was the only tea in the house. Flavor just wasn't good."
5,For Carpenters enthusiast like me that plays piano and loves to sing,"The songs in this book are the most popular songs that Carpenters did though I am also looking for their version of I'll Never Fall In Love Again.Anyway, if you love to sing,the keys are totally the same as what Karen used. Also the notes are accurate except for other instrument line like guitar, flute, etc.The book comes brand new, no folds, and yes, good smelling (new book smell).Here is a sample of one song I play using this book.[....]"
1,DONT BUY IT!!,I just feel robbed. You should be ashamed of yourself for putting this up for sale. So sad that people take advantage of these situations. It was a mess.
1,A Total Waste of Money,"If you are a fan of Whitney Houston, do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this. It is just a bunch of british unknowns talking about Whitney Houston with just a few pictures of her sprinkled throughout. Then they all sing their own original music. I think this is just a way for a bunch of unknowns to get their music listened to by Whitney fans. Using Whitney's name and her fans to promote their music. A total waste of money for a true Whitney fan who will be totally disappointed with this dvd."
1,Disappointed,I was very surprised and disappointed by the contents of this video. It did not journey her life in anyway and there was no narration or navigation. It went from one interview to another and you had to figure it out. It was not a good representation of Whitney at all. It ended with words scrolling on the screen that updated the viewer.
3,So Far Not Too Impressed,"I've tried Zeasorb, Gold Bond, creams, prescription strength products, etc. So far the best thing that works is regular baby powder (just talc, no cornstarch). It's way cheaper too!"
2,"Gold Bond works better, and smells better.","Gold Bond works much better than this stuff. It cools better and seems to absorb better too. Anti Monkey Butt does nothing that Gold Bond or the generics don't, and I don't like the fragrance at all. It smells like a diaper mixed with perfume. The monkey butt gimmick is just that- a gimmick to get you to buy a mediocre product. I'll be going with another brand."
2,WHY ?,"WHy they don't release Demon's two really worthwhile albuns, ""NIGHT OF THE DEMON"" and ""THE UNINVITED GUEST"" ? These one here is nothing compared to them ..."
4,Nice Design,"I like it and it works very well.The only change I'd have liked it to have would be a slightly dampened retraction .. but, so far it works wonderfully."
4,so far so good,"works good...hard to insert into the cigarette lighter though, and the blue light is way too bright, very distracting when you're driving at night"
5,So Convenient!,"I've had this charger for a few months now, and it charges my Razr faster than the more expensive Motorola one I used to have, PLUS it is incredibly convenient: it fits easily into my console box when I'm not using it, the cord is so long, flexible, and light that I hardly know it's there when I'm using the phone while it's charging, it never comes unplugged the way the spring-like coiled ones constantly do, and it's just fun when I press the little silver button and the cord zips back in to be stored out of the way with no chance of tangling. LOVE this charger - I'm buying another for back-up and one for my friend who has a blackberry and envies mine!"
3,"Good, just not as good as everyone says...","This is a very good movie but doesn't stand up to the ravings of artistry etc. It's a good film, period."
3,"Strong subject, great deal of violence, predictable","This movie is set in an Irish institution for delinquent children in the 1930s. Many of the children are very young, so it's hard to imagine why they were incarcerated. The Catholic men running the facility were made out to be monsters -- the head person was sadistically violent and his aide was a pedophile. The plot is that a good, non-Catholic man comes to teach there and tries to defend the kids. It is very clear that the head person is going to eventually beat one of the kids to death, and it's pretty clear which one it will be. The violence is extreme and hard to watch, as is the sodomy of a young child. The performances are very good, but the editing is poor, jumping around so that it's hard to follow the story - there must have been explanatory parts cut to shorten the movie. Also, there is never any rational given as to why the head master so enjoys beating the kids. NOTE: this is not a movie for pre-adolescent children."
5,Beautiful music.,I sat back with the lights dimmed and a cup of hot coffee and enjoyed the beautiful haunting music of years gone by. Memories abound.
2,Only worthwhile for fans,"Harmless but really pretty awful in every other respect. The second star is that one needs to see actors like Cusack and Tom Hanks in some of their earliest parts to see how far they came. Also, they were able to cram everything people hate about cheesy 80's movies into a single flick, which shows effort and also justifies the 2nd star. And they did manage to make Gilligan's Island look Oscar-worthy. Hmm, if I keep at it I may have to give it a 3rd star."
3,Another 80's Movie,"This is another John Cusack movie from the 1980's. It is not his best, but is still an entertaining movie for all those kids who have had the summer jobs and have wracked up hours of daydreaming. This movie has funny animations like that of Better Off Dead, another John Cusack 80's movie. Nonetheless, I give this movie three stars."
3,Savage Steve Holland,"One Crazy Summer-Overall/liked it, specially the endingBetter Off Dead-All Time Favorite!!"
2,Not Crazy Enough,"This movie is cute if you really loved ""Better Off Dead"" but doesn't really hold up under closer scrutiny. Too many characters changed and just aren't as charming and the jokes just aren't as much fun."
2,Cult but not classic,"Don't get sucked in by your love for John Cusack! Although this is another case of a loveseeking boy-next-door that every girl wants, the cheese factor kills any 80's value this movie might have."
4,"""Grounds for a mercy killing.""","Yep,the movie style may have been emulated before but in my opinion, Rich Hall's character as the gas station attendant is a formidable scene. I will go as far as comparing it to Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken in ""True Romance."" ok, that may be pushing it. enjoy."
1,just another dumb preppie vs. nerd movie,"This movie has been done over and over again, with different actors and by different directors, but the plot is stale and has gotten extremely boring. Don't bother with another cookie cutter movie of this kind.... buy something original or save your money!"
3,One Crazy Summer,"John Cusack and Demi Moore are entertaining in this light comedy from the 80s. Bob Goldwait does some wacky stuff including dress up in a Godzilla suit and cause panic and destruction that will earn a few laughs. Moore plays a struggling singer as in ""No Small Affair"" that can't seem to get the money together in time to keep her house. Their zany group must find a boat and get it ship shape to enter the Regatta to win the trophy to trade for Moore's house so it won't be plowed under and made into Condos. This is of course by a underhanded rich family of snobs that have won the Regatta for years. If you are in the mood for some 80s style comedy this is a decent bet. Not quite the firepower of a ""Ferris Bueller"", but certainly worth a look. Good quality DVD with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Summer Rental"" and ""Better Off Dead"".CA Luster"
4,John and a very young Demi for one crazy summer,"This is a light comedy that was prolific early in the 80's. Along the lines of Meatballs and Caddy Shack, you either like it or not. It is easy to watch, with John playing around with cartoons that have provided me with funny lines in many conversations. Vary hard to find a copy in a video shop. so if you are in to this sort of American humor get it!!"
4,Filmed In My Home Town,"I still remember fondly the ""One Crazy Summer"" that they filmed the majority of this movie in my home town (Hyannis,Ma on Cape Cod).It was so cool to see the cast at local restaraunts and bars.John Cusack,Demi Moore(pre Bruce Willis), Joel Murray(Bill Murray's younger brother)and Curtis Armstrong(Booger from the ""Nerds"" movies).It's amazing to see the paths their careers have taken. The movie is cute and silly,certainly not a masterpiece,but I love to see all the familiar sites(Cusack's graduation was filmed where I went to Jr. High and ""The Nantucket Drive-In"" was actually the now nonexistent Hyannis Drive-In where I have great memories of childhood, seeing the Billy Jack movies with my siblings and my Mom,later partying with friends and dating girls as a teen). I'm sure my personal experiences color my view of how good this movie is, but doesn't nostalgia play a large part in how we remember much art? All I know is,I like watching this movie.It makes me smile :)"
4,You don't understand: she's gonna lose the house!,"It must have been a close call whether they could make more money trying to sell this on DVD or getting the cast to pay them not to. My advice: watch the movie, so you know how bad it is, then watch it again with the commentary by Curtis Armstrong, Bobcat Goldthwait (in his normal voice, thank God!) and Savage Steve Holland. They know it's bad, and they love it. You'll really enjoy it that second time, with what amounts to a running laugh track and better jokes than are in the movie. It's a riot."
4,As expected,"I can't really say there's anything special about this sweatshirt... It'll keep you warm, is a little on the thin side (don't expect to wear just this in sub-zero weather), and looks as pictured.It does have the ""new sweatshirt"" smell, and has not gone away in three washes; hopefully it'll eventually pass!"
1,Doesn't stand up to use,"We bought this cabinet in April for our new family room. Now in November it just headed out my door for the junkyard. It began with the bottem rail piece in the front falling off, My husband tried to fix it two times. Then the large bottem drawer began not rolling right and falling off the tracks. This piece is horribly made and is not worth the money unless you plan on never moving it or using the drawer. Don't waste your money. This stand is made by O'Sullivan, spend the extra money and by a Bush cabinet. That's wat we got for our living room and it's extremely sturdy."
4,Solid construction,"This is a well constructed Item, though the Doors are a little squeeky and irritating to hang properly.The shelves are off center which gives it a strange look when the doors are shut, maybe i'm a little picky.This item is heavy but easy to construct.Look at the dimensions carefully it is taller than i thought the Picture made it look."
5,Outstanding James Dean Book,"This is the best book that I have ever read about James Dean and his vehicles. Lee Raskin has done an outstanding job of bringing Jimmy and his love of speed and vehicles to life. I highly recommend this book JAMES DEAN: AT SPEED to any James Dean fan or anyone who loves vehicles.// Lee has also written the best coverage of Jimmy's tragic fatal accident that I have ever read and since 1955 I have read all of them. I have hundreds of books, articles, magazines, LP albums, wall posters, DVDs, etc. concerning Jimmy I have collected since 1955. JAMES DEAN: AT SPEED is the best."
2,Disappointed My Boyfriend,"I recently bought this book for my boyfriend, whose bookshelves are peppered with other books about James Dean. A couple of weeks later, I took it off his shelf, was flipping through it and said it seemed like a nice looking book. I asked him how he enjoyed it. He seemed disappointed. He admitted reluctantly that he considered returning it, but didn't want to hurt my feelings. He shrugged his shoulders and said, ""It's a nice coffee table book, I guess, and it's pleasant to look at, but it pretty much sugar coats the real story of Dean's life and there's just not a heck of a lot of important new stuff there."" When I told him I was going to rate it on Amazon, he said he wished he could give it a split rating: three stars for the photos, two for the text."
4,homage to Dean,very informative and the opening introduction from Marcus Winslow I found quite moving. Lots of photos I haven't seen before.Definitely one for the fan
5,Fantastic book,"This is the best researched and illustrated book on James Dean and his sports car passion that I've ever read, and I own a modest library of books on sports car racing for comparison purposes. I love the way it includes all sorts of illustrations of sports car and movie memorabilia, not to mention the many photos of Dean at work and play. It also includes details about Dean's ultimately fatal attraction with racing Porsches, and is written by someone with extensive Porsche racing experience. Overall an attractive and outstanding publication that will appeal to fans of both Dean and Porsche."
1,Small sticker,"these are not for your big car , this is for only a model car or RC racer, dont plan on putting this on your car"
2,Reads like a gaming manual,"I'd picked it up for two reasons:1) I enjoyed Byers' War of the Spider Queen title2) The premise of the series intrigued meI was a bit disappointed in the end, mainly due to the writing style. Each action taken by a character seems to be prefaced by what almost happened, or what would have happened had the circumstances been slightly different. Being familiar with D20 rules I can understand that Byers is trying to explain the various spells/feats/skills in whole as he moves the story forward. However, I'd expect this sort of detail to work better in a gaming manual than a novel. (You can almost see Byers writing this book, throwing dice to decide the outcome of each scene.) I found the writing style confusing at times, and often had to reread a paragraph or two to figure out what had just happened. In the end, the writing broke my suspension of disbelief.I don't see myself reading the rest of this series."
4,The best of this genre since everyones favorite drow,"It is very true that this genre is not mind altering literature but for the pulp, fun, entertainment that it is, this series is very good. I have read the three twice and have found them on par with some of the other good post tsr stuff, like everthing Drizzt is in and the Erevis Cale stories. I highly enjoyed it."
2,Not so good,The product is definitely not worth the money IMO. It's smaller than my screen size and it doesn't stick tightly to the screen either.
2,No spin here,"This was a waste of money. My kids can hardly fit inside of it, plus it just tips over the minute anyone gets inside of it. We tried and tried to make this spin in the water. Just doesn't happen. My son uses it as ""base"" for water gun fights. Guess I'd give it a greater rating for that!"
2,Don't get it,"We bought this and while the idea of a cyclone spin is attractive-- none of us could actually spin. You need another person on the spin side -- I guess-- it's a good float, but it's not a cyclone spin"
2,non cyclone spin,we bought this for our pool because the description said it was a fun spinning toy.That is just not the case.spinning is next to immpossible for the average person and when you can get it to half spin the kids fall out due to nothing to hang on to.a better name for this thing would be the tip over and fall off huge floating circle.thank God for the creativity of children and the fact that it is a neat place to hide inside of or i would have taken it back to the store..if your looking for a fun spinning toy you have not found it in this product!
3,"Fun Toy, But Not Wide Enough.","The toy is made very well, the only problem that we had with it was that it tipped over. We had kids between the ages of 7-13 using it, and none of them were able to get into the toy without it flipping over. Even when they were in the toy, we had to have an adult stand on each side of the toy to make it stay upright. So, if you want to be in the water holding the toy up, i would recommened it. Otherwise, I would recommend investing in a different water toy."
1,cyclone doesnt spin,We tried this toy for the late. It just kept tipping over. No one could get it to work. We threw it out.
4,Cyclone,"My grandchild loved this but too many others used it and were not careful and it popped, they are going to patch it and try again"
5,My favorite drum and bass cd ever,"This cd is everything some drum and bass comps aren't. It changes pace, it covers styles, it changes the way you look at drum and bass. I would recommend this cd to anyone over any other drum and bass cd period."
4,great history read,"Koestler gives a great description of the flow of thought from Copernicus to Galileo. Fascinating stuff, written so the lay reader can follow some very complex ideas. The only down side is that the section on Newton was very thin compared to the figures he covers prior to Newton. Still very good. Enjoyable."
5,Fascinating reading,"Arthur Koestler's book on the rise of modern western science is certainly controversial, for instance, his appreciation of Copernicus' work is not what we naively would expect. But the book is very good and has fascinating parts, as the one in which Koestler puts the blame on Plato for the human obsession with circles and spheres that delayed for centuries the emergence of the correct view of the Solar System. The shrewd analysis of Copernicus' and Kepler's as men assures the reader that science is after all a very human endeavor. And there is much more. I enjoyed it and recommend it."
3,Parker..America's Finest Shotgun,Good book for a beginner or intro to the Parker shotgun. I was looking for very detail information which I could not locate.
4,Atlantis,I ordered the Atlantis cards to use in the various reading work I do. They supply a deeper insight to what is was I was looking for
3,Used Return?,"This horse is really cute but I think it was in someone elses house before mine. I expected it to look like the picture with a nice high head set but the head hung low as if he were depressed. Could someone have sat on it? The box he came in was just about falling apart being held together with boxing tape. There were several holes in the box. The plastic he was wrapped in barely covered him. I truly feel that if this was a brand new horse, it would have been boxed better. I have bought several items of Melissa and Dougs and have been very pleased with the quality. I don't believe this was a M&D problem, but an Amazon one."
5,Very happy with the gigantic smiles and hugs my grandson gave me and his pony,"My grandson was able to sit on his pony with no problem and it was a manageable size for him to lug around the house. My grand son is about 45 lbs. However, when his friend 60 lbs sat on it he crushed the pony to the ground. No worries we were able to reposition the pony back to a solid stand and it is still sturdy. Everyone is happy."
4,Slightly disappointed...the box was damaged.,"I bought this horse just a week ago and it cost me $65.00 and now it is $49.99 , this does not seem fair considering the shabby condition the box came to me, it was open and very dented, apparently they tried to tape two boxes together and it was not a good tape job. I would return it but the box is destroyed, but if they did give me the price difference in return then I would greatly appreciate it. The horse is not as sturdy as the previous horse that I have bought my daughter, so hopefully this will survive at least a year?"
1,don't waste your money,This is not very strong. The rear legs collapse when sat on. Ok for a stuffed animal but not a toy for a child to sit on. I returned the item.
1,Terrible purchase,"I just wanted to give everyone a heads up concerning this horse. Do not waste your money. My niece had a little horse that looked just like this one and was very sturdy. I thought I was buying the same one, I was not. It is extremely rickety, sorry there is not other word to describe this toy. We bought it for our three year old (around 32 lbs.) for Christmas and I was hoping that it would simply make it through the day without breaking. I didn't want her Christmas ruined because her toy broke. It's legs bend very easily. I am not sure what type of support it has but it feels like a wooden rod through the back. I have to say that it is cute but useless. It is not cute enough to be decoration and not sturdy enough to be ridden. Kids can sit on the horse but they must sit very still and be careful getting on and off, as it is prone to collapse. Just a note of advice, research any purchases you make through other companies first."
2,not as nice as I thought it would be!,"I really thought this would be sturdier than it is. The legs are not solid, so my daughter cannot sit on it like many I've seen in stores. I am not happy with it."
2,Boo!,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old daughter who loves horses. This is such a big horse that any kid is going to want to sit on it. But they can't. Every time my daughter (who is small for her age) or my 5 year old son gets on it, the legs bend and then it falls over. The only time it doesn't fall is if the kids keep their feet on the ground and bare their own weight. This toy was such a disappointment and a source of frustratiion for the kids. Boo!!"
5,a horse is a horse,"My granddaughter requested this for Christmas. She loves it, have pictures of her hugging it after opening. It is large and will take up space. However a little girl can let her fantacies run wild."
3,Sad little pony,"The horses legs got bent when my daughter tried to sit on it. I was never able to straighten them up, so the pony always had a sad little lean."
5,Awesome toy!,This horse is sturdy and tall. It is a wonderful toy for toddlers. It is very real looking and fun to play with.
2,Not as good as other reviews posted,Although my kids love it....I hate it! Other reviews said how good it is and how there kids sit on it and pull it around....well whenever my 3 yr old climbs on it it falls over! The legs give out every time. My 6 yr old can climb on it but has to sit still or it again falls over! I was excepting more
5,Really beautifull cross!,I purchased this item and was very happy when it arrived. I have become an Amazon junkie and found the jewelry they carry to be wonderful. This necklace is very pretty and perfect for everyday wear. I love it!
2,Expected more,"For the price, the cross is very nice but the chain is much too thin. Will need to replace chain because it is too difficult to take on and off. Also, scared that chain will break and I will lose cross."
5,SO CUTE !,I bought this to use at my wedding on 04/18/2009 but when I received the first one it was broke in half. I was very upset so I contacted the seller who was GREAT ! They sent me a second one free of charge they even paid for the shipping ! I call that great customer service ! Thanks !!!!!( This will be perfect- it fits my Fairytale wedding theme )
3,Where and When,"Released in April 1988, the album allegedly captures the trio - Edgar Froese, Christopher Franke, Paul Haslinger - during a June 8, 1986, concert in Albuquerque, New Mexico (29:52) and an August 1987 performance in West Berlin (27:13).None of the music from the Albuquerque recording came from that show and was probably recorded sometime in early 1988, well after Franke had left the group (the West Berlin date was his final show). Being the final material for the Jive-Electro label, it is hard to gauge whether the incorrect dating was necessary or it was a mistake in labeling.The soundscape is somber and reflective. This is a setting that firmly places TD on a path to the ""New Age"" period of the early years in the next decade."
4,Pretty good book,"""Merseyside Girls"" is the frist book that I read by Anne Baker and it was pretty good. Nancy, Amy and Katie are the Siddons girls. Nursing and some the pretty girls that you have ever seen to the outside world. But there home life is a nightmare, with their policeman father who holds many secrets. But in War-time England life is changing quickly for everyone. And with change, can come whole new lives.Overall, I really enjoyed this book, the only reason that I didn't give five stars is that Katie seem a little too clueless for me."
3,sounds??,"this was a gift. When I asked if they liked the way it makes sounds, they told me that it did not make any sounds. I was very disappointed because this is what interested me in choosing this puzzle. Maybe there is a secret to turning the sound on??"
2,Horrible sound effects!,"Bought this for my 18 month old son for supervised play, I would not recommend it. The sound effects are pretty loud and annoying. Also, it does not matter which piece the child is trying to put into which space, the magnets on the back of the pieces will make any of the other spaces go off...so if baby tries to put the airplane into the car space you will hear the car sound effect even though the piece is wrong. Sort of annoying. Additionally, the pegs are very small and if you or your child has ever stepped on one - VERY painful."
2,Skip the sound & buy chunky puzzles!,"I'm a big fan of Melissa & Doug toys & puzzles, but this sound puzzle was a major let down. First of all you don't have to put the correct vehicle puzzle piece in the correct spot to make the sound. So really the sound aspect of this toy is not there for teaching; just annoying the parents with the awful sounds. Secondly, I can walk by the darn puzzle and the sounds go off due to the sensors, so quality is lacking. It would be a much better puzzle without the sound, so I'll probably take the batteries out. Stick with the chunky puzzlesMelissa & Doug Vehicles Chunky Wooden Puzzleand save $ and sanity."
2,okay,It is a neat looking puzzle but when my son opened it on Christmas the sound wouldn't work. We tried different batteries but still no sound. He does like the puzzle but the main reason I bought it was b/c it was supposed to make neat sounds. Maybe it was just one time luck that it didn't work.
4,Great beginner puzzle,"My 22 month-old son has many wonderful abilities, but puzzles, however, are not quite his forte. This puzzle he loves! He concentrates on mastering it because he enjoys hearing the puzzle sound as he places the car, motorcycle, airplane, etc. into their correct spaces. And the sounds are clear and authentic. Your child (and you) will have a lot of fun with this. It's also a great gift."
3,works inconsistantly,"The sounds don't always work. I just received it yesterday and put new batteries in, yet the sound is inconsistant."
3,A quick parental sanity check,"I rarely write product reviews, but wanted to just take a quick moment to reiterate the importance of not installing batteries in this puzzle. It's infernal. The photosenors which trigger the sounds are super-sensitive. At the slightest casting of a shadow, you'll find yourself listening to a parade of roaring motorcycles or a honking truck. Spare yourself. For the love of sanity!"
3,Better without batteries,"We usually love Melissa & Doug products, like Band in a Box. This puzzle itself is fine, but the sound is HORRID. Maybe a 2 or 3 year old boy wouldn't mind or can ignore it, but my 1 year old daughter was so scared of the noises that she cried in fear until I removed the batteries. I realize she is too young for puzzles, but I was just testing it, and even I cringed when I heard the noises! They sound more like noises that should be on a mechanical alien monster. My daughter had some fun with the puzzle without the sound."
3,"Great puzzle for little ones, not great sound","My son is almost 2 and loves anything with wheels. He loves hearing the various car, truck, ambulance, etc. sounds on this puzzle and can put the pieces in by himself quite well, but if you're expecting great quality of sound, you'll be disappointed. At nearly 2 though, my son isn't that picky and he loves this puzzle."
3,Not Melissa and Doug quality . . .,"My son received this as an Easter gift. At first everything worked fine. But we soon realized how annoying and ineffective this puzzle really is. First of all, the sound only worked for the first two days when trying to put in the pieces. However, it works just fine when it's sitting on the shelf with just a few pieces in. Then the sounds go on and on and on.Educationally, the pieces don't have to match up with the right slot for the sound to go off (if the sound works in your puzzle). The sounds are also very generic sounding and, with the exception of one or two, you couldn't even guess what vehicle it could be.I am very dissapointed in the quality of this Melissa and Doug product. We have several other Melissa and Doug toys we have been very pleased with, but this one was a dud."
5,another classic DVD by Frank Vignola,this is an excellent course by Frank Vignola. He gives lots of good advice in soloing and rhythm . don't miss it!
2,not very thrilling,"From the comments I read,I thought I was about to embark in a nail-biting thriller - nothing farther from the truth. The story is well written; characters are finely developed, but the story does not thrill. Medium pace; series of flashbacks; does not really climax anywhere, just fizzles."
2,A Difficult Read,"Although I usually really enjoy Ruth Rendell's books, this one was below the average. Her characterizations are always well done and they were in this book also; however, there was not a single character with which I could identify or have sympathy for. I do not recommend this book."
1,Worst book I've ever read,"I majored in 17th century English lit; I am not a stranger to tedious writing. My wife gave me this book to read without telling me how awful it was. I read the other reviews and wonder if we read the same book? The plot is non-existent, the book moves at a snails pace with no perceptible direction, and the ""shocking"" ending was the biggest letdown of anything I've ever read. I would give this dreck zero stars if possible."
1,Painful experience,"First, there are only two reasons I even completed the book: I wasn't going to let a bad writer get the best of a good reader, and I didn't have much other choice for books written in English at that time. Contrary to the other reviewers' opinions, I think the characters show very little development. They remain self-centered hedonists the entire time and do the things self-centered hedonists do. Ms. Vine tried to give the novel a dark and foreboding tone, but only succeeded in suffocating the reader with a wet blanket of boredom. While she could have redeemed the book with better descriptions of the settings and changes in that, she only made half-hearted attempts to do so. I have not read any other Vine/Rendell books, but my advice is to pass this one until you've read another. I hope it is just one bad book amongst some good ones."
4,Tensions build and build as you read this book.,"No one can create an atmosphere of tension like Ms. Rendell writing as Barbara Vine. I know as soon as I begin one of her books, that I'm on an unstoppable ride until the very last pages. This particular book is wonderfully written, and there's a nifty little surprise at the end. The best thing about Barbara Vine is the way she unfolds her plots, and weaves past and present together so it's hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. She also has an uncanny way of building the scene for her books, so that readers feel that they are right there where the usually horrible act occurs. The fun is in the unravelling of the mystery. In this book we have five young people spending an idyllic summer at a grand country estate. Irrevocable occurences happen during this summer of 1976 which come back to haunt these people almost eleven years later. Tensions and stress build and build until the final shocking ending. Great stuff!"
4,WOW...powerful ending and wonderful story-telling,"This is the first Barbara Vine book I've read and I really enjoyed it. I found the first couple of chapters hard to get through, but I'm so glad I did stick with it. Vine does a good job of going back and forth between the present and the past, though occasionally I had to reread a little bit to fully stay on track. The end certainly had a wonderfully suspenseful twist that leaves a person wanting more."
4,Starts off strong,"The first half of the book is paced well, and eases you into the New Testament Greek. About the midway point, conveniently when the grammar gets more advanced, I think the explanations and lessons start to weaken. That could be just the nature of the level of study, when you get into Optative mood and all the obnoxious Genitive usages, nonetheless, that is when the instruction should step up and clarify better. I felt the instruction took a step back instead. Nonethless, the beginning chapters are excellent, just be prepared to be patient when you get to the really hard stuff."
3,Grammar school style textbook from 1960,"It's okay, though may be oldfashioned for some. Has decent traditional verb tables in the back, but no handy summary of case inflection. Haven't seen McNairs similarly titled book (which is probably in breach of Hodder's Teach Yourself trademark)."
4,"Elementary, compact size, covers all the basics. A++","I really liked this book. It covers all the basics.It has gives a good coverage of the basics, and has good explanations, and good practice exercises, charts, etc.,forming a solid foundation for future study of New Testament Greek."
3,"A good introduction, but...","This is an older edition from the 60s. It's ok as an introductory text, but doesn't really prepare you to read the Greek New Testament. A lot of effort is wasted translating English-to-Greek, which is not really necessary.After you finish this book, you should buy the book by Gavin Betts which currently fills the slot formerly occupied by this older book in the Teach Yourself series. (http://www.amazon.com/Complete-New-Testament-Greek-Yourself/dp/0071752641/ref=sr_ob_5?ie=UTF8&qid;=1325714732&sr;=8-5)By the time you complete both of these books you'll be ready to work through a Greek reader or two, then take on the New Testament.One thing about this book is that almost none of the reading exercises are taken from the Greek New Testament. The vocabulary words are all NT words, but it just seems strange not to include more than just a few sentences from the NT. In the Gavin Betts book mentioned above, all the reading exercises are taken from the NT."
4,"not as good as others in the series, but still great!","being a huge fan of sasek's other books, i picked up this one as my mother is from australia.it seemed to be a lot wordier than his other offerings, and don't get me wrong, i love learning, but for a younger person i could see this being overkill. the lovely art takes that edge off, but it's worth mentioning.whether the wordiness is a put-off or not, this book is definitely worth perusing. i love an artful history lesson!"
1,"Even worse than the ""black book of God""(The Bible)!! itself","This is just as bad as the evil book ""Bible"" itself!!Nobody willl ever like this movie, and I hated how Yehoveh destroyed the CHILDREN of Sodom and gommorah!(HAh! THERE IS some innocent blood on you believers' hands).The world was never flooded, and we have the scientific research to prove it.I find it hard to believe that God spared humanity just because Noah was entertaining, and that God wouldn't let anyone on the ship procreate .Just be glad the wiccans didn't walk up to church and rant about this violence,immorality, and inaccuracy.I don't think that a deity would drown all his subjects at the FIRST SIGN of sin, or simply because they accused his prophet of ""Sorcery""."
1,Don't waste your money on rubbish,This movie is a joke! It is absolute rubbish. I never even finished watching it because I got so angry I thought am I watching Noah's Ark or Sodom and Gomorrah? Don't waste your money like I did. The title is deceptive and I was deceived into buying a movie which I thought was based on the bible account.
1,What a Joke!!!,"I bought this movie because i love stories about the bible and i like jon voight. But this is a terrible, terrible movie. Talking about how noah's sons and their wives were not married before they were on the ark, etc. Take my advice don't waste your money on this piece of junk. AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!!!!"
1,Misleading And False,"I bought this sometime ago, but returned it to the kindley seller who took it back.Whoever wrote the script for this movie apparently never read the Bible, or even checked to see if the presentation of facts was accurate.I'm not going into the falacies, and chronologically incorrect things presented. I will, however, warn anyone who chooses to watch this in an effort to learn correct biblical facts, there are a multitude of incorrect presentations. This was the most inaccurate movie on biblical times I've ever viewed."
1,mocks the scriptures,"could have been a good movie but way to much ""directorial priviledge"" in the account."
1,Please don't buy,"If you're looking to add to your collection of bible video's then don't buy this. This was just a movie that someone made that didn't know the scriptures. First Noah didn't talk to the Lord about Sodom and Gomorrah that was Abraham and Noah didn't warn Lot the Lord sent angels to warn him. We all know when Noah and his family boarded the ark there where no people left, but not in this movie. People had survived the flood and was in ships trying to attack the Ark. The worst of it was the leader of the pack that was trying to overtake the Ark and that was Lot. I can't forget to tell you the part where Noah and his son starting fighting. After looking at it I threw it in the trash."
1,FALSE ADVERTIZEMENT,"This film was advertized as a cinematic specticle with a host of highly regarded actors, but it was actually more like ""monty python's unholy ark."" I'm ecstatic that it was NOT billed as a comedy, because then it could have potentially had a larger viewing audience. I rented this DVD at a local movie rental store (in the drama section) and returned it for another rental after only 30 minutes into it. I would have shut it off after the first 5 minutes, but I thought it had to get better. (I WAS WRONG.)"
1,Absolutely the worst I've ever seen.,No attention to detail. I'm sure they didn't read the book. They didn't even get the order of events correct. It was absolutely sickening. I watched for about an hour before shutting it off.
1,Noah's Ark - Far from accurate.,"For anyone who knows anything about the Bible, this was a very disappointing film. There were many inaccuracies, it was slow, long, and just plain boring. The only good thing about it was the special effects. If someone is going to make a movie about an event in history, they should at least get it right!"
1,get it back ... please good god no!,Anyone familiar with the old sitcom THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES might remember Jethro Bodien's comment about wanting to be a brain surgeon or a soda jerk. This movie suffers from terminal Bodeinism! It doesn't know if it wants to be a drama a comedy a documentary a bicycle or a banana. As a result it fails miserably in all categories.A virtual marathon of meandering occasionally interrupted by inept attempts at intentionally inappropriate humor. There is so much about this movie that's just not good from the unconvincing acting to the awful scriptwriting that the only thing to say is THIS IS BAD ... REAL BAD!
1,Can you rate a movie with a negative number of stars?,"If so, I would give this a -10. It's Horrible. Simply Horrible, with a capital H.I was taken in by the hype surrounding this mini-series, only to turn it off in the first 30 minutes. Poetic license is naming Noah's wife. Dramatic effects are the dialoge between Noah and his neighbors. Thank God I didn't watch through to the pirates attacking the ark.When it comes to this movie, just say ""no."""
1,Shame on Hallmark,"I have seen this movie on Hallmark which is used to bring us fine quality historical and epic movies. It's really shame that they show us this garbage which pictures Noah as a fool under the claim of literary licence!I'm a Muslim and not a Christian, and Noah for Muslims is also a great and respected prophet who has an entire chapter under his name in the Quran telling his great story."
1,Rancid!,"Like most TV miniseries retelling classic myths, this one is totally rancid, even more so than all the others. Acting, F/X, dialougue- all painful to the senses.As for the innacuracy, I've got a funny story- I remember watching miniseries like ""Merlin"" and the Odyessy on the same network, and throwing a fit because they took gross artistic liberties. Everyone said I was too nitpicky. Then this movie comes along, and they're reacting the same way I did. Hardy har. What the hay- if they don't feel like staying true to the old Greek and English myths, why not the Judeo-Christian ones?At least Merlin was slightly better."
1,One of the Worst!!!,"Although I'd like to recommend this movie, I cannot. Hallmark Hall of Fame produced this ""new"" version, which is totally out of whack with the biblical narrative.Jon Voigt as Noah may be fine, but when suddenly the men of Sodom and Gommorrah arrive on the scene to have a battle with Noah, you know there's something wrong. Sodom and its companion city of the plain wasn't even in existence at the time. And there are other blatant errors as well.I couldn't even recommend this for the entertainment, but if you want a couple of laughs, this may be it for you."
1,Not biblical,"I was very impress with the quality, but the story line is not the way it is written in the Bible. It is very disappointing. I believe that this video is a lie and this is the way the world would like to make the bible like. (Half truth) If you want the truth in your live, don't waste your money on it."
2,Not a keeper,"Definitly does not follow the bible well, Thiswas not creative liberties, because the same specialeffects could have followed scripture. It was eitherignorance or deliberate. However, since many ""highlyreligious"" folk tend to only look at what they want toin the bible and ignore the rest, or interpret the bibledifferent from other religious, how bad this ismight be debatable.The special effects are good. James Cobern keeps poppingin humourous way.The violence was pretty bad, I had originally purchasedthis for my children to help them learn a bit more aboutscripture, thought it would be educational, but theviolence was so bad and it was so biblically inaccurate,I decided against letting them see it."
2,Noah's Ark - Jon Voigt,"This movie is not very realistic. The sets are great!, but the story is a Biblical SNAFU! They had the chance to embellish the real story, without compromizing the Bible's account, but chose instead to incorporate incidents that were thousands of years later, which impeached any incredibility it might have had. I didn't like it much for that reason."
1,Another 40 Days of Flooding May Come because of THIS,"This over hyped NBC movie was the worst thing I have ever sat through in my entire life. As a fan of the members of the cast and expecting an epic film, this was a major disappointment.The screenwriting is horrible. It often resembles bad improv. The mixing of Biblical stories was sloppy and without plot value.Save your money or buy the Dash & Lily video. It was fantastic!!!"
1,movie is totally garbage,"This movie is ridiculously inaccurate. Noah and his family get attacked by water pirates led by Lot who by the way wasn't alive till about 1000 years AFTER the flood. There's a water peddler as well-NOT IN THE BIBLE. Sodom and Gamorrah are destroyed which also doesn't happen for another 1000 years to which Lot has a big part. This ""Lot"" is a huge sinner, his wife is horrible and he has no daughters. God is portrayed as whimsical. Noah's son's aren't very godly either. It's inaccuracies and toying with the bible makes it worthy of kindling to start a fire. Don't bother watching it if you know the bible and love the Lord you will end up being disgusted too. Hollywood will do anything to ruin biblical movies. Stick to The Ten commandments, The Passion of the Christ, this one isn't worth 10 cents..."
1,Special effects don't offset a corrupt theme.,"Frankly, the producer's request to overlook their use of 'poetic license' is unacceptable. The Bible contains important truth for us, and this movie tramples it. If they had desired to play games with special effects and epic scenes, they should have chosen another source for the story than the Bible. The movie is a hopeless mishmash of badly digested scenes (and mis-matched individuals and timeframes) from the pre- and post-flood biblical narrative. And the dialog concerning the reasons for God's judgement is blasphemous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, for any reason. It is not fit fare because of its misrepresentation of God's judgment on the pre- and post-flood world. The movie is more subversive to truth than most of Hollywood' sewage due to is treacherous misuse of the Biblical themes. It is bad news."
1,First DVD to go in the trash,"Absolutely dreadful; apart from being an insult to the bible story I couldn't tell whether this was a spoof or not. Imagine several bible stories mixed together, add in gory scenes, a few special effects and you end up with this apalling mess. I don't know if it gets any better but after the first 35 minutes I ejected the disc and threw it in the trash. Avoid at all costs, rating should be minus 5."
1,Noahs ark,this has to be the worst thing they could do.. if you really believe in the Lord DO NOT BUT THIS MOVIE... it is based on many lies first off noah didnt save lot and his wife from sodom and gomorrah abraham did. and it was at least 350 years after the flood that this happen and after the tower of babel. but they have noah in sodom and gomorrah and then moving on and building the ark after its destruction. they also show a pedlar in a boat coming up to the ark once everything is flooded and they have Lot on a ship attacking noah for his ark.. it is a half truth and in my opinion a MOCKERY and i will never buy anything again that has the name hallmark on it. how dare they sell such a lie to people
1,"Waste of Film, Time & thought.","Excited at first to see a modern movie about noah's ark, I was disgusted to say the LEAST. From the first few minutes...I knew this was going to be stupid. The script...ayayay Who the HELL wrote this?!?!? And how did it get as far as to actually be made?? This ""movie"" was full of bad humor, bad acting and the Worst direction. How they even dare to ""sell"" this on home video is beyond me... 1 of the Worst movies I've ever seen."
1,Help what idoit did this to the good book?,Boy NBC much need the money or they need help. the Actors are good but what happen? hope that they dont do this all the time.
1,This movie insults Hebrew and Christian believer alike.,"This film is an unconscionable slap in the face for anyone who believes that the bible is part of a pathway to understanding the mind of God. One need not be a fanatic bible thumper to be insulted by the total disregard for the beliefs of hundreds of thousands of faithful people. Six million Jews died because they believed these stories. Countless Christians have suffered persecution because they trust the words in the bible. Truly I would be ashamed to say I had ever worked on this project I would have my name removed from the ""credits""."
1,Terrible,"I will not waste too much words on this. As a christian you should forget about this movie, for you will find it utter bull. Especially the scenes in which Lot tries to capture the Ark as an old-day pirate, a panhandler sailing the seas on an old-day waterbike and Noah's family starting to become crazy, makes you wish you never put on the DVD, let alone bought the crappy thing.Take my advice, do not come near this product!!Ps. One star is too much!"
1,regret that i ever saw this movie,I watched this movie on tv and i regret I ever saw it. First of it was not anywhere near accurate to compliment the story of the bible and secondly when I saw two lobsters as well as two male peecocks climbing into the arc that was it for me
1,What can be said that hasn't already?,"I can forgive bad acting, stupid effects and maybe even completely distorting the Biblical story. I can forgive these things if the script was even moderately clever. Which is why I can't forgive this piece of garbage. When this movie was trying to be clever, it succeeded only in being annoying. Stay away. Stay far away."
1,Needs a 0 star rating for this one!,"Wish they had 0 star ratings, but no option for that. This was so anti-Scripture it was rediculous. It looked like the movie was made just to totally twist the stories and make up their own stuff to confuse people. Sad that people will see that good name ""Noah's Ark"" and think it might be the true Biblical story. So, just so you know...IT'S NOT even close. YUCK...would be the best word to describe this movie. Don't waste your time watching this...you'll be very glad you passed this one up. Even the newspapers reports on it ripped it to shreds...about being totally nondoctrinal, and unscriptural, and making fun of the true stories of the Bible. So thank God for those many true reviews of this twisted movie. The old classics were so good at staying online with Scripture...best to stick with those. Enjoy the oldies but goodies...and especially enjoy reading the real thing...THE HOLY BIBLE...no better book than that! God bless. :)"
1,why cant we give 0 stars,"i must admit the first hourof part1 was entertaining, but after the affects got to be awful and the story turned s far away from the real story i grew broed and like a idiot i watched the 2nd half and when i saw then hallucinating and tlaing to oranges i wanted to run out of the room screaming, 1 delightful thing was carol kane who is always great"
1,Even Worse than you think,"If you are under the impression that this story resembles what you learned in Bible School, think again. All concerned parents must not allow their kids to see this video unsupervised. If you must see it,(as I would not recommend it) please review it first."
1,Noah's Farce!,"I'm not a particularly religious person, but this took irreverence to the point of blasphemy. If nothing else, why use a catacylsm as the premise for a spoof? The arsenal of ""hip"" modern dialogue, pratfalls, double entrendres, vaudevillian asides and just plain bad acting leaves one hoping that the whole enterprise would have sank.....Ark and all. Watching Academy Award winners Voight and Abraham mug their way through this ill-written disaster illustrates the seductive power of money. There is absolutely no other reason for them to have partaken in this debacle."
1,don't buy,Blasphemous references to scripture and extremely poor special effects made me wish there were a rating lower than 1 star to describe this movie.
1,Why can't we give zero stars?,"This cinematic claptrap is as lame as they come. Never mind that the story makes a complete mockery of the biblical account of Noah, it's just plain bad acting and directing. And who, oh who, ever gave actors the idea that people in the ancient Middle East spoke with a British accent? This ""movie"" -- and I use the term loosely -- is simply awful. Don't waste your time."
1,The Worse Bible Movie Ever Made,"This is probably the worst Bible movie ever made. It combines the stories of Noah and Abraham into the life of one person (Noah), and then it adds some special affect miracles to give it glitter. It directly contradicts the Bible in so many places it would be impossible to list in this short review. The biggest problem with the film is that some people will watch it and think this is the story of Noah from the Bible. It is not!"
1,The Boat that didn't float ...,"This ARK has been ship wreaked on the ocean floor, and please no one try to raise it. Bad acting, bad script, bad FX, bad everything. Okay, so they said upfront that they stretched it a little to get a better story, but this was to much of a stretch even for the Bible. Looking more like a really bad scene from Saturday Night Live bit than the quality I've seen Hallmark produce. I don't know how to put it into words other than to say ... this movie really was bad. God was wishy-washy as to what he wanted to do, Noah was a drunk, the rest were just as strange and the tiny ship was lost in a bad movie. I think the Koala said it best when it took a power poop on screen. Clearly they tried to make an epic on a B-movie budget. What a waste of film, save your money and read the book."
2,not happy,Did not follow the Bible at all. I did not care for it. I would like to see more movies based on the Bible.
1,It's not just bad...,"...it's barely watchable. It looks like a version of Noah's Ark made for dinner theater, and isn't to be taken seriously, except as an example of how not to produce a Bible story. It isn't that artistic liberty was taken--someone took the plot of Noah's Ark and produced something here that bears almost no resemblance whatsoever to the real story."
1,Don't take this onto your ark!,"I was at a thrift store when I came across this. I thought: Three Academy Award-winning actors (Jon Voight, Mary Steenburgen and the guy from ""Amadeus"") and director John Irvin. How bad could this be? Well, if it were in the ""So bad it's good,"" category, there might have been a rainbow at the end of this stinker.It sinks as bad as an ark full of two-of-a-kind animal poo. If I am ever desperate enough to consider showing this during Sunday School, please excommunicate me! On the other hand, it does have one of the worst lines ever recorded onto any screen. ""Hey Noah, going to the orgy later?""The only good part of the whole purchase was that some of the money went to a good cause thrift store, and the good cause thrift store was minus one God-awful film. The cast and crew should be stoned for this. That is where the One Star comes in to play."
1,Noah's Ark,I have no idea how anyone could play in such a movie if that's what you want to call it. I thank God I am a christian to know this is a farce. To me it's a joke on God and you don't play with God this is not funny it's a disgrace to the Lord. This is trash and should betaken off the shelf and burned. We couldn't even finish watching it let alone our children. Point blank this movie is not bible based and should not be watched unless you are not a christian and just don't care. I really give this 0 stars.
3,Hilarious,"This movie was so incredibly out there that I laughed until I cried. For instance, the wood for the ark was cut and stacked on pallets, like it was deliverd by Home Depot. When I saw that I knew this one was a winner! I think I saw Noah using a Dremel tool! My wife wanted to watch it so I was forced to see it, and I must say it is very entertaining if only to pay attention to the obviously ridiculous stuff. Some people point out how the movie is vastly different from the bible... What I'm saying is this movie differs from common sense. It is almost painful to watch at some points, painful from the laughing you'll be doing."
2,Not at all like the Bible,"I only like this movie because of the exciting things. But I really don't like it because it is not at all like the Bible. First of all, they had other characters that weren't in Noah's day and they were supposed to be Noah's friends in the movie. Also, they added hours of stuff that people didn't really care about and it just wasted time. And another thing, why in the world would there be a caravan in the flood? That is just so stupid! The Bible said that only Noah and his family survived by being in the ark, not a stupid caravan guy and his things that he was selling. Besides, if in the Bible it said that he was there, there would be a very small chance that Noah and his family would see him if he was the only person besides them. This should be a fiction story more than a Bible story."
3,Belle Helps Out,"ASIN B000B78AUY - Some parents might find themselves feeling a wee bit misled by the title. Belle, in fact, does NOT help out.Belle loves reading so much that she forgets her promise to help her father, who is upset (not with her, just upset) when she finally remembers and appears in his workshop. Belle learns that she must keep her promises.Had Belle actually helped out, the title wouldn't annoy me so much. What Belle actually does is learn a lesson, a good thing all by itself. The images are standard Disney and young fans of the Disney Princesses will probably enjoy them. Still, the book is essentially a short, preachy thing with a badly chosen title (yeah, I'm not letting that go) and hardly worth the investment unless you just happen the stumble across one - or if you're a collector. Other than that, pass on this one.- AnnaLovesBooks"
2,Starts great but quickly goes downhill,Christopher Fowler has an atmospheric setting and a nifty plot to hang his story on but that can't last for three hundred pages. The characters are undeveloped to the point of being annoying. Scenes seem to be writing in such a rush that everything melts together. And of course we get the standard police-trying-to-solve-a-mystery subplot.
1,Out of date,"Well written but badly in need of revision, the book is a historical curiosity but will be of little value to anyone conducting serious research on the Internet today."
4,Review,I was pleased with the time of arrival with the product and it indeed was what I was looking for.
4,Costumes & Paint,"THE OLD FOX DECEIV'D by Martha Grimes take Richard Jury and his coharts to the edge of the North Sea, where the streets of the fishing village of Rackmoor. The last person who wants London's CID on the case is Inspector Ian Harkins.A young woman is murdered while on her way to the 12th Night Costume ball and her harliquin painted face looms in many minds as a long lost heir to a local squire.Melrose Plant jumps at the chance to escape Aunt Agatha and assist his friend.So far one of the best of Grimes.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
3,intriguing but not as funny,"As the previous reviewer said, I enjoyed The Man with a Load of Mischief largely for the humor, and that was provided by the characters of Melrose Plant and his Aunt Agatha and by the setting of Long Piddleton. I was relieved to find Plant eventually turning up in this plot as well, but only through a farfetched coincidence. The overall tone was gloomier than in the first book, which was disappointing, since I get plenty of gloom from Elizabeth George's wonderful, but depressing, books. I'm also waiting to see (I haven't read any other books in the series yet) if the character of Jury is ever developed more fully. We're told that he tends to get depressed, he wonders if he's a good policeman, and he likes to make tracks in fresh snow -- and as far as I can remember, that's about it. Almost every character in the book seems to have more of a distinct personality than Jury does. I will keep reading the series but will hope for more Aunt Agatha and less fog."
3,"More Plant, Please!","Anticipating more of the humor and eccentricities that characterized the first in this series, The Man with a Load of Mischief, I was disappointed to find much of it missing in this second book, The Old Fox Deceiv'd. The plot is as intelligent and intriguing as all of Grimes' stories in the Richard Jury series, but I prefer it balanced with the charm and delightful characterizations of the denizes of that English village Long Piddleton. While Richard Jury is Grimes' hero in this series, the character of Melrose Plant is the one that makes me keep returning to these books for more."
4,Wonderful myster Christie's style..,"Finally i got to read something close to good old Agatha - wonderful book. Reminded me of ""Peril at End House"" "" Mirror Cracked"", of course, but in my case it's not a bad thing! Very charming characters, good story, atmospheric location- what else do you need from a mystery!I can't wait to read the next one!"
5,THE BEATLES,If you like the Beatles then you will like hearing this autobiograpy pon them when the first started out. An awesome tale of them being interviewed and telling their stories on how they grew up and started the most Fzamous band of all time.Good listening.
1,Not a lesbian film... Story telling needs help.,"Though I appreciate the film project for a film class, this is not even rated at ""C"" level. I like to help up and coming lesbian directors, but this film need lots of help. It takes talent or lots of training and experience to tell a story. The director needs more training. The story is definitely not a lesbian film, however, it did explore sexism (minimally) in basketball. The story is mostly about basket ball, and the only thing ""lesbian-ish"" about it is a peck on the lips that's on the cover... it's a 2-sec lesbian-ish. I give it 1 Star for effort. Cheers!"
1,disappointing,"Trying not to spoil it, but if I wanted to watch basketball, I would turn on the sports channel instead. The general pace of the movie was slow, and the plot disappointing. No real lesbian love scenes. No *really* good ending. Definitely short on entertainment value. I would buy this only if I had money to waste and time to waste watching it."
1,waste of time,"The title of my review says it all. This movie sucked! I guess the reason there aren't any reviews for this movie is becuase everyone was smart enough not to watch it. This movie had no plot and honestly i don't see the purpose of making this movie. The worst part about this movie though would have to be the film quality itself. I have no doubt in my mind that they did not just grab a camera and say lets go film some scenes, becuase that's what it is an overpriced home video. So i recommend you do not waste your time or your money, like i unfortunately had."
2,Showed a lot of promise but disappointing in the end,"If you're looking for a film with some lesbian action then look no further than the cover. No, seriously, look no further than the cover of this dvd because it shows the only kiss in the whole movie. Don't get me wrong this movie isn't all bad, it was watchable and at the start it showed some real promise of development of something building. Then the kiss happens. Then nothing. What a let down. A rent-don't-buy movie."
4,Nice indie film,"I actually liked this film. I thought it was a delicate piece that unravelled nicely. Oh, and the lead actress was really hot. This is an indie film with all the associated values, so if you're looking for a big budget flick with special effects, this might not be your thing. But if you enjoy character driven indies like I do, then its worth it. PS, the kiss scene was interesting..."
2,Making Maya Not Well Made,"Making Maya was okay, I guess. When it was over, all I could think of was Peggy Lee's song ""Is That All There Is?"""
1,even worse than the average indi lesbian flick,"This movie was painful. It was poorly written, poorly filmed, and poorly edited. It was slow moving, had weird, choppy sequences, and I caught myself laughing whenever the characters were upset/serious because it was so unbelievable. After seeing quite a few indi lesbian films, I feel my standards really aren't that high... but this movie was well below my meagar expectations."
2,dissapointment,"This is a good little movie and it looked interesting by the cover and the overview of the story but this movie fell far short of my expectations. I've seen low budget films before and liked them. This movie however, wasn't acted well and the story was more a bi-curious tale. Needless to say, if I knew what the movie was like before I bought it, I wouldn't have bought it. I'd recommend to rent this before owning it if you want to see it."
1,Disappointed,Really a bad movie (it's only my perception). This film is empty. I found absolutly no interest in this story. Nothing else to say. Just one thing : the audio was awfull
1,Don't waste your money,If your looking to watch a nice lesbian love story this definitely isn't one of them don't waste your money I promise you'll regret buying it just like I did...
4,Evolution of the Unidentifiable,"The next installment in the evolution of the Rx Bandits is well worth the buy. Like most music that is entirely original, a few listens may be necessary to appreciate the worth of this album. Approximately my sixth or seventh time listening to the album from start to finish is when I realized its importance. For anyone who knows the Rx Bandits, this is a must buy. For anyone who is not familiar with them, check out their website and you'll find a few mp3's and videos that are worth taking a look at."
5,"Wonderfully entertaining, cheesy horror flick!!!","Love this movie! I had the awesome opportunity to attend the premiere of The Key and enjoyed myself tremendously! It's a wonderfully entertaining film that had me jumping, groaning and laughing. It's cheesy yet fun and eerie. It was filmed near my home so had that connection not to mention one of the actors is a dear friend of mine, but aside from that, if you get the chance to watch this film, I think you will enjoy yourself. I am a horror buff and my interests go from absolute terror to the total cheesy experience. Watch this flick and be entertained!"
5,My life will now be complete...,"Long before I ever heard the band Can, I heard this album and LOVED it. It WILL change your life. Holger is a madman, hearing music in everything---he incorporates noises from a variety of sources. The guitar and keyboard work are very pleasing...it's all beautiful. I used to sneak cuts from this album onto an FM jazz show I used to do...Some people freaked right out, some people worshipped me for playing it, but I always got phone calls. Buy this release. It's Hula music for ice cream lovers. It's summer and swimming, it's the rings of a tree."
3,A comment from a Krautrock fans...,"Technically speaking, this record is excellent, with lots of complex arrangement and studio tricks. it's recorded nearly the time Can's broken up and this record surely recaptured the late post 1975 Can's standard. But, it's not the same old Can, the weird, avant-grade, kosmic Can that we love, it's a extremely polished, yet lacking some inspiration which made Krautrock so special. So, if you think that you love Can's early (pre-1975) works, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM. I give 3 stars for the studio technique only. For Krautrock fans I would rather recommend Irmin Schmidt, an underrated creative force in Can, his solo work that combined classical influence is very endurable. Try ""Musk at Dusk"" and ""Irmin Schmidt anthology"" and you won't regret."
1,Do not waste your money.,"Please do yourself a favor and do not waste your money on this cd. It is just boring instrumentals that remind me of the ""musak"" that you can hear for free in any elevator. The other reviewer is correct in stating that the title is very deceptive. If you are looking for real samba, you will be terribly disappointed by this cd."
1,Deceptive title. Tracks are tired repeats.,"This CD's title is totally deceptive. Samba do Carnaval is full of drums, life and fast-paced samba. This CD is full of orchestral arrangements of Bossa Nova songs. Which is fine, if you're into that, but then the title should be ""Bossa Nova"". Don't waste your money. There are a lot of great CD's that have real street samba on them."
4,Goose on the Loose,"I read Goose on the Loose. I thought that it was a great book, because it was full of surprises and wasn't a slow or boring book at all. It was Mostly adventure. I would recommend this book for anyone who loves animals. Especially Geese. The book is also funny, the pictures are very clear. This book is great and I would recommend for any one to read this book. It isn't very hard to read and it's a great book. If you like animals that this is the book for you!"
4,"Provocative, well-grounded study of Jesus and his family","Most psychological studies of Jesus have been fatally flawed either by lack of attention to historical accuracy or by a tendency to ""pathologize"" Jesus. Miller presents a carefully worked-out thesis, grounded in developmental theory, that seeks to explain some troubling factors in Jesus' relationship to his family.The appendix, tracing the history of psychological treatments of Jesus, is worth the price of the book alone for anyone interested in psychology and the Bible."
3,Not without its own flaws,"A psychological study of Jesus is certainly a worthwhile endeavor. However, some of Miller's methods seem questionable. For one thing, he relies pretty heavily on Freud for his psychology. Also, he bases some of his conclusions on iffy biblical passages. For example, the account of Jesus teaching in the temple when he was twelve is found only in Luke and is regarded by many scholars as a Lukan creation. The book is worth reading - with a grain of salt."
3,Disappointing,"""Psalms 1"" provides the reader with a commentary on the first 72 psalms. Each commentary contains the psalm followed by explanations of its origins, uses in the temple, the traditions and periods from which it sprang and its comparison to other psalms and Scripture passages. The verses are grouped by function, such as lament, confidence in God and deliverance.I was somewhat disappointed by this book. While I did pick up some insights into how the Psalms developed over time and their use in Temple worship, I really do not feel that I am more familiar with the Psalms than I was before reading it. It is an intellectual study, not an inspirational work. I think that one seeking an understanding of the Psalter can find better aids."
2,The Value Growers:,"The authors present some potentially useful research findings from a multi-year study undertaken by A.T. Kearney, the consulting firm. Unfortunately, they present too little of the details from the research project for the book to be as useful as it could be. The book becomes quite repetitive after several chapters and seems to have little new to say after a point. It is worth reading for the limited number of researching findings presented--just don't expect too much."
1,"Folks With Lanolin Allergies, BEWARE!","Although my doctor recommended this product for a severe outbreak of eczema (the worst I've had in over twenty years), the supposedly non-reactive lanolin in the lotion caused a major case of contact dermatitis. (Which I haven't had since trying Keri Lotion to treat the last major outbreak....) IMHO, if you're in any way sensitive to lanolin, stick with either Aveeno or Cetaphil."
1,Misleading label,"This is nothing more than the Livin' It Up CD and the If You Ain't Lovin', You Ain't Livin' CD combined into a different package. Be careful....."
5,George Strait,I received the CD in record time and in excellent condtion will be doing business with you again. Thanks for the excellent service
4,Best 2006,This album has already been added to my best of 2006 list. Lovely lyrics matched with enchanting melodies; you will have no problem listening to this album from beginning to end. I highly recommend.
5,Every music lover must buy this album,I'm a fan since 1983 and I just bought this album. I didn't expect it to be so good because I usually like original versions. Now all I have to say is that all the songs in this album are excellent and THIS ALBUM MUST BE OWNED NOT ONLY BY FANS BUT BY EVERYONE. Sincerely.
