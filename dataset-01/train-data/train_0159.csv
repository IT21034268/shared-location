2,ouch!,"This book can be summed up in one simple sentence: life is hard and then it gets harder. The author heaps so many bad things on the main character you start to guess exactly what is going to happen before it does. Despite all this calamity, however, the heoroine never seems to change or grow. The other people in the book are pretty much stock characters: the inattentive, incompetent doctor, the town drunk, the pinch-mouthed mother-in-law, etc. In addition, this is a familiar tale of hard scrabble existence and survival in the face of all. It has been told elsewhere and much better. Check out: MY DROWNING."
4,Down to earth,"I read this book a few months ago over spring break and could not put it down. Perhaps that is because I had nothing else to do, but I think it has more to do with the truthful way in which the story is told. The author maintains Julie's voice throughout the novel, and successfully belies her [Julie's] extremely rural upbringing. The reader easily forms a mental picture of Julie, her husband Hank, their shack, the flood, etc.One reviewer described the book as ""depressing;"" I disagree. I found the book uplifting. Even in what nowadays would be considered substandard living conditions, Julie remains optimistic and dedicated. She knows how to perservere, and that is admirable. I greatly enjoyed this book, and recommend it to anyone who likes whole characters, writing, and setting.Also - the pig slaughter scene that is constantly mentioned is not that gruesome."
2,There are better books ...,"GAP CREEK is a pretty disappointing novel. All plot and little development of character or setting.If you liked GAP CREEK or think you'd like to read a similar book, try FAIR AND TENDER LADIES by Lee Smith. The voice, character, setting, and plot are so much more alive than in GAP CREEK.I wish Oprah would ""discover"" Lee Smith."
4,GAP CREEK,"THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING BOOKS I HAVE READ IN A LONG TIME. THIS TRULY HIT HOME, AS I AM FROM THE SOUTH AND FIND SO OFTEN THE SUBJECT OF BEING IN OR FROM THE SOUTH DIPICTS A PERSON OF SLOW WIT.IF AFTER READING ""GAP CREEK"" YOU STILL BELEIVE THAT THEN SO BE IT.. JULIE IS A REAL PERSON AND HAS COME THROUGH THE HARDEST OF TIMES AS A GOOD HARTED AND WARM YOUNG WOMAN. STANDING BY HER HUSBAND THROUGH THICK AND THIN .. MOSTLY THIN... SHE IS A WOMAN OF SUBSTANCE AT A VERY YOUNG AGE.THIS IS A WONDERFUL READ AND KEEPS YOU WONDERING WHAT NEXT?"
1,Never ending story...,"Page after page of sadness and gloom to finally end up still in sadness and gloom... The story, little of it there is, is just a description of people going through life with such privation and hardship and just accepting it. I just could'nt bear it anymore and read the second half as fast as I could. I would not recommend such a dreary and monotonous book."
4,An Enjoyable Read,"I thouroughly enjoyed Gap Creek, and found it to be an interesting look at the first year of a married couple's life together during the turn of the century. For the most part the story kept me turning pages. Although, there were a few lengthy and tiresome descriptions of various farm chores and animal slaughtering, they reinforced the reality of our heroine's world. I also found the speech patterns to be slightly annoying, but easily tolerable when taken into consideration the time and location in which the story takes place. Julie was a wonderful heroine who teaches her reader about contentment, thankfulness, patience, and perserverance. Overall it was a delightful read that I would recommend to anyone."
2,'Taters! 'Taters! 'Taters!,"Just like so many readers, I went for one of Oprah's Picks! I didn't have to read this book to know that women are hard workers, have backbones, and can continue to carry the weight of the world on one's shoulders, even in the darkest of moments! If you like repetitive descriptions of ""'taters, grits, and cornbread,"" and undeveloped characters throughout the book, then you might enjoy this read. I kept reading just because I thought that eventually something might happen. Thank God, at least Mr. Morgan came through with Mr. Pendergast's Hidden money ! I don't think this will be one for the big movie screen!"
3,"Interesting detail, no emotional punch","For reading a detailed account of life in Gap Creek, I was expecting more of an emotional attachment from the protagonist than what Robert Morgan gave the lead character."
2,Story doesn't seem to be ended...,"This book would be good for young people to read who have never thought about hard life once was for a man or woman or child. It probably accurately describes where items were stored and how food was kept during that period. Privies, which most young people have never experienced, are covered. Cooking, the danger of fires, hog-killing are discussed and beneficial. Some parts of the book, however, are useless, such as the implied sexual attraction between Hank and Carolyn. The relationship, if there was one, was never completed in the story and I read through to the end thinking something else had to happen. In summary, the book was somewhat interesting but didn't fully complete the story insofar as I was concerned."
3,Gap Creek,"This novel is a heartbreaker. The story is written quite well, but the plot is overly dramatic. If you can think of a horrible thing to happen to someone, it probably happened in this book."
4,A study in perseverance,"This was a really good read. It followed the life of a young Appalachian girl at the turn of the century. I thought the descriptions in this book were very in-depth and engrossing. Julie, the main character, is a study in strength of mind and body. She is able to do what needs to be done simple because there is no one else to do it. She cares for herself and others in a fascinating, no-nonsense manner that is very engrossing. Although, it is a book without alot of happiness, it is a study of life and survival."
3,Mixed Review,"I thought there were some wonderful parts to this book;how hard Julie worked,the conversations between Julie and Carolyn,etc but there were some very boring parts and some that did not make sense.There as a lack of conversation between Julie and Hank as newly weds. I cant understand why someone like Julie would choose Hank. Many people who read the book commented on how hard life was for women at that time. I agree. The world we live in now has many modern conveniences that were not available during the period of the book. I did write to the author and he answered me."
1,"Blah, blah, blah","This has to be one the worst books I've ever read. Boring & incredibly tedious is an apt description. I actually ended up disliking both characters, she was pathetic & he was a bully. The only good thing is that I borrowed this book from a friend & didn't actually spend any hard cash for it."
3,A Strong Woman Can Endure Anything,I found Julie to be a very strong woman who stuck by her family no matter what. I felt for her having to watch her brother and then her father die. I felt even worse when her mother and sisters depended upon her for almost everything. I think she just married Hank partly to get away from her family. Then Hank takes her into a foreign world and makes her work just as hard. Then the owner of the house dies and they are able to withstand a flood and the loss of their first born. Throughout it all Hank looses it and takes his frustrations out on Julie. As if loosing a baby wasn't enough to finally get the farm working again and getting kicked out because the greedy heirs.....so she picks up and endures yet another move (pregnant again)
2,Tedious,"I have read books that deal with human suffering and hardship--Les Miserables, or lately, The Heartsong of Charging Elk--and they inspire me. This one doesn't. In fact, it is tedious in its descriptions of one tragedy after another. What bothered me most is the heroine's inability to do more than work. Yes, hard work is commendable, but so is change, and her character though stoic, is static. She seems to be destined to a life on the level with some animals because her only outlet is to work and then work harder. I think good fiction should give us a glimpse of a better way to live and to respond to the suffering that is life. Julie has one response and never varies from it. Gap Creek has one note to play and pounds it from the first page to the last."
4,Compelling story,I loved this book. It is hard to believe this was written by a man. The childbirth scene from Julie's point of view really rang true for me. The dialogue was enjoyable. I found myself caring about these people and what would happen to them.
3,Lemoney snickets...a series of unfortunate events,"Read this a while back. The book is about a young couple whose lives are filled with poverty, loss and a series of misfortunes. You feel for Julie and the hardwork she does every day and grow to root for her even when she does some foolish things (won't say what). It also shows that love can endure the most difficult periods in one's life. Overall, it was a well-told story, well written."
4,Great story,I loved this book. I felt I was left hanging at the end as the story seemed to just stop. But I suppose since it was called Gap Creek and they left Gap Creek the story was over once they left. I think it could have had a better ending but all in all it was an excellent story of survival and love.
4,insight into farm life,Great book highlighting tough times on rural farm. Strong characters facing life's trials and tribulations!Hard to put down as you want to see what happens next.
2,This Creek Doesn't Rise,"This story of a young couple's hardscrabble married life in a valley on the NC-SC border could have fit neatly into a novella. While the direct, dramatic opening and follow-on introduction to the Harmons promises a colorful family saga, ad nauseum repetition and details of every mundane activity extended the story beyond interest. It seems like every scoop of grits and every pot of coffee was described. The best scenes are delivered upfront; so, by the middle of the book, nearly everything important has happened. While the major characters, Julie, the narrator and her husband, Hank, are rather flat, the writer's portrayal of them as immature and nave is realistic. The strongest moments features Ma Richards, the mother-in-law. When she leaves Gap Creek, she also leaves a huge space in the plotline. And, she doesn't return soon enough to save `Gap Creek' from being a tortuously slow, morbid story with an unfulfilling ending."
3,I liked this book,"This book was very good. Not great, but very good. At times it became too driven by the conflicts instead of character, but for a summer read, you could do a lot worse..."
2,"DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE TO BE AN ""OPRAH"" PICK","After finishing this book, my first thought was that this author must be best friends with Oprah for her to have picked it. When I see it on the bestseller's list, I have to laugh. It wasn't even that good....as a matter of fact, it was boring. I never read a book where the characters were so un-developed. You never find out what any one individual's motivation is for doing anything. In marrying Hank, Julie leaves one life of drudgery for another. Now I understand that this was the way life was back then but the author has the nerve to have the words, ""The Story of a Marriage"" right under the title of the book. If this was the story of a marriage, then Julie should have stayed single."
3,It didn't quite click for me,"Just getting-by is tough in turn-of-the-century Appalachia and the vivid descriptions of the physical challenges of the way of life there held my interest and kept me turning pages. Developing the story of Julie and Hank as newlyweds facing the world doesn't work as well, however. Hank is just too craven and pitiful in contrast to the redoubtable Julie. His redemption came too late and was unconvincing. I just couldn't buy it!"
4,The Real Meaning of a Marriage,"The book started off slow with the life of Julie living at home, and then moving into the difficult life of this young woman. Through Julie's eyes we see that she has such an optimistic outlook to what is going to happen and hopes for the best for everyone and everything. We see Julie going through hardships such as verbal abuse, work overload, the loss of a child, brother, and father, and poverty. Though these harsh things happened to Julie, she ends up finding herself and converting back to her religion. Hank, her husband, is a man who has gone through many troubles and does not know how to control his anger at points in his life and ends up hurting Julie as well as himself. Julie has troubles with Hank's mother, and at the beginning of the book is not able to express her feelings for Ma, but eventually almost has a mental breakdown and yells at her. I enjoyed this book although it was difficult to get started with, yet it ended with such a powerful message to all."
5,I loved it.,"Life isn't easy or candy coated, and neither is this book. I will recommend it to all my friends."
2,"Too much, but yet not enough","This book had too many..I said, she said, he said, mama said...and so on. Is this an established writer? I got through this book by just skipping all the ""saids"" and just reading what was said by the character. I feel sorry for the people who had to hear it on audio. How did you get through it???"
4,For my point of view,I am 15 years old and in high school. I thought that this book was Unbelievable. So many things happen in such a short period in time. It makes you want to step back and look at what life could be like. It also makes you want to rethink about even getting married. You think if something that bad could happen to me when I get married why should I even start the madness. This book is not the best I read but it makes you want to read on to see how they resolve their problems.
2,Not worth the time to read,"The highlight of the entire book was the birth of the child on the kitchen floor. Other than that, I found the book somewhat lifeless. I had no sense of the characters, they didn't jump off the pages at me like other books of the same genre have."
4,Oprah picked a good selection this time!,"""Gap Creek"" was good. I have only 2 complaints. I really was sickened by the description of the child throwing up the worms. I really lost my appetite after that. The other thing I found to be terrible was the episode about the umbilical cord. There are some things that are better left unsaid. The rest of the book was really good. I'm soo glad I was not born in Julie's time period! She worked like a horse and Hank acted like a baby. I'm glad to see they came to terms with each other at the end."
3,"A Classic Oprah Book - Poverty, Loss, Love and Redemption","This is a pretty classic Oprah Book minus the fire that is present in her best picks.This novel explores a marriage and the struggles of poverty and loss. In the face of difficulties we strike out at the ones we love as it is much easier and safer to express anger than it is to express pain and hurt. In the face of adversity, we steadfastly move forward to create a life of connectivity and meaning.If you are set on reading the books selected for Oprah's book club, there are many better ones than this."
4,A World,"I have been living in Western North Carolina for 6 years now. I found the setting and folkloric background wonderful and rich, enlightening me about the spirit of mountain people and their direct relationship with their habitat: sometimes lyrical, other times full of hardship. The vernacular Appalachian used throughout may alienate readers who are not used to it. But stay with it --eventually this book goes right to your heart. The subtitle ""The Story of a Marriage"" cannot be overlooked, because the perceptive and quirky voice of the young wife in the story guides the reader through wildernesses emotional and physical, shedding light on the human condition. This is truly inspired writing."
4,good read.,"I enjoyed this story. great characters, nice writing. a novel about hard times in rural areas. I would read another one by the same author."
5,"Oh, to be able to create such imagery","This spare little book is a minor masterpiece that takes you by the hand, back in time, to a simpler and more brutal place. There are so many priceless jewels captured in this novel. Morgan does an exquisite job of capturing the pain of childbirth in a way that surpasses any previous description. It is raw, gritty stuff. Life at the beginning of the 20th century was not for sissies. And he has done a quite remarkable job of capturing a tiny slice of this time. Beautiful prose."
2,poor knowledge of women (especially SEX)- slow writing,"A disappointing attempt to write about female sexuality in this book. I am sorry, but no 17 year old virgin has an orgasm on her first sexual encounter after walking for miles to a new place away from her family for the first time in her life with a man she knew for 2 weeks! How old are you? Geez Richard...I thought you would know that it's different for women! If you don't know, you should find out, especially if you choose to write in their perspective! I agree with the one reviewer who complained about Robert Morgan's style. It seemed to get worse in about the middle of the story. I skipped sentences to keep interested. The book does a good job showing how hard it was to live back then...lots of hard work! The language was very realistic...simple and Southern. I find myself saying , ""Work aint nothin but work."" Lots of religion at the end too! Ugh.Good for Winter reading but nothing THAT spectacular."
2,Gap Creek,I read this book because it was Oprah's bookclub book.I was very disappointed. I never knew that a pregnant woman could work so hard and not have a miscarriage.I got so tired of her cooking grits and taters. And her husband reminded me of my abusive ex-husband.He was very mean and hateful to her.Two thumbs down
2,Too Depressing,"This was my first major disappointment from the Oprah book club. Although the book is well written and the author paints a very vivid picture (sometimes too vivid), too many horrible things happen to make the underlying message of hope ring true. You are constantly left wondering what catastrophe can possibly happen next. Similarly, you keep waiting for things to turn around and they don't. It's the type of book you'd have to read for an American Lit class, then write a profound paper on. Unfortunately, it's just not very profound."
1,How many bad things can happen to one person!,"This book was horrible.Every page was about what bad things happened to this girl and her family.Everyone treats her bad and every other day devastaion happens.It is not realistic.I just don't understand why you would want to read a book about a sad life.Books are suppose to make you think and feel.This just seemed like you were saying to yourself ""I am going to throw this away of one more thing happens"".Oprah really surprised me with this pick!"
1,"Dismal, depressing, unremittingly grim","The book begins with a little boy dying as he vomits tapeworms that are still alive and wriggling, and gets grimmer from there. This is the single most depressing book I have ever read, because it's essentially hopeless without the redemption of educating or instructing the reader in any meaningful way. Robert Morgan can certainly write; I only hope that he writes more interesting books in the future."
1,"Dull, dull, dull",I couldn't even make it half way through this book and I rarely do not finish a book. It's drawn out and boring boring boring!
4,A Mountain Fan,"Dear Reader, Gap Creek does a good job of showing how life used to be in the mountains of North Carolina. I know because I grew up there. Just like, Julie Harmon, I've milked cows, sawed firewood, and ate cornbread for breakfast. I can also identify with Robert as a writer. My novel, Edge of Heaven, puublished: November, 1997 by Bright Mountain Press in Asheville, N.C., is set in the same place and time period. I think it is hard for a man to write about a woman's feellings and still harder to tell a story in first person. This method prohibits the author from letting the reader know how the other characters, who are important to the story, are feeling and thinking. Given these handicaps, Morgan did a great job. If you would like to compare the two books take a look at, Edge of Heaven, at Amaazon.com. You can email me at emae57@earthlink.net."
1,Oprah - give me a break!,"Will probably make a decent ""made for TV"" movie, but was poorly written and far from literature. ""He said, I said, she said, he said, I said"" - where did this guy learn to write? This is the last Oprah recommendation I bit on. Oprah, you're loosing it."
5,Brilliant!,"This is a novel about a very poor young couple living in the Carolina mountains after the Civil War and their hard, hard lives. The work of day to day living back then was mind-boggling! The characters go through many trials and tribulations - fire, flood, extreme poverty, deaths of loved through and clean up after a flood; childbirth. This book reminded me of the book ""Christy"" and ""Strangers in the Forest"". Very realistic, very well written, amazing to us modern day folk. I only wish it had been longer, I hope there is a sequel featuring the young couple."
4,It was like listening to my grandmother speak...,"My father's family hales from the mountains of Virginia, and I felt Gap Creek did a credible job of portraying the mountain life. That alone would have made the book interesting, but there was more. I found that the heroine, Julie, was someone I genuinely liked and admired. She was a real person who made real mistakes, but she also had a core of integrity that directed a lot of her decisions. It was refreshing to have the main character be someone I'd want to sit down and have a cup of coffee with. Actually, it was my affection for the heroine that leads me to only assign this review four stars. While I enjoyed the author's beautiful prose, I wanted more of Julie's thoughts and feelings to be described, since I found that to be the real strength of the story. So, the portrayal of everday life in the mountains was realistically harsh, but the characters, especially Julie, are worth getting to know."
4,Worth your time!,"I was able to close my eyes and visualize the storyline. Mr. Morgan, obviously, has been to our valley. The depiction(s) are accurate. I enjoyed the attention to detail that was provided and when I completed the book, I closed it believing that ""Julie's story"" could really have been the ""story"" of many in our valley during this time period."
4,Gap Creek,I thought the book should be appriciated for what it is.This is a book of simple people and I got exactly that.I don't agree that the characters were underdeveloped.I think that is what the author wanted and it was his intention to focus on the way of life instead of a deep complicated character.I thought Julie was a great charachter to express the lifestyle and times.It was simple but very good. I felt taken away in Julies world and learned alot of interesting things about their times and living.
3,Gap Creek,I thought this book to be very good at times and boring at other times also heartwrenching. Through the Delivery scene I would have expected a woman writter. In the end I was left wanting to Know more about Hank & Julie. If they make it and if the new babie she is carrying lives.
3,Really wanted to love this book . . .,"but so far I only like it somewhat. I have to admit it has kept me up at night, more in anticipation of what could happen - only to be disappointed that not much does. Altough, Morgan is very descriptive, especially when it comes to every single meal Julie makes and step by step instructions on how to slaughter a hog, I found myself skipping paragraphs out of boredom. I am a little more than a third done so I may be unfair in my judgment. I would have liked more character development, what does Julie look like, how is she feeling about being pregnant (besides her churning stomach), etc. I have never read a book with so much despair and hard luck in my life!"
1,How Depressing,"I am dissapointed that Oprah included this book on her list and even more dissapointed that I wasted my time reading it! The entire novel is a progression of horribly unlucky events. Life is hard enough without bringing the trials and tribulations of this young woman's life into your own. In most novels where shadows are continually cast upon the lives of the characters a light appears at the end of the tunnel. In Gap Creek, I was pleading for the end of these poor people's lives as it appeared to be the only means for their escape from the hell on earth Mr. Morgan cast them in."
3,Pleasant reading on a summer day,"I read Gap Creek last summer and found it to be historical and entertaining. I live in West Virginia and was intrigued to purchase this book because it pertained to areas I am quite familar with. The book was somewhat boring in a few parts but overall I found it to be a true testament to the hardships people in Appalachia had to endure. It gives me a sense of gradtitude that I live in the present time. One gripe I had was the several pages describing the hog slaughter. Being a vegetarian, it kind of made me queasy."
2,Depressive,"Besides being a depressive story, it's hard to believe so many thing could go wrong in anyone's life. Also it is not really the story of a marriage from beginning to end as I expected."
3,Already been done,"This book was a slow read. Although I had read it in a short period, I found myself bored with the story line. It has been done to many times. The young, innocent, farm girl meets the man of her dreams. The book seemed to much like the colour purple. I found myself skipping paragraphs."
1,Really disappointing,"I too found it a page turner - but because I was hoping the book would get better. I read it in three sittings, and skipped whole paragraphs just so I could finish the book. It did not get better."
3,This book was okay.,"This book was okay. It wasn't a ""keeper"" but it was good enough to pass along to a friend. There really weren't any memorable moments that would make me want to re-read it. Not a bad book, but not a great one, either. I've read better ""Oprah Club"" books."
4,Grit and Glory,"If you ever felt that you truly had forgotten what it was like to pass from adolescent into the harsh reality of young adulthood, this is the book that will help you see things as they are for so many ordinary people. It is a tale of those who never had it easy, and likely never will, who walk the uphill of life taking each bump as it comes, clear eyed and without any expectation that life will be different than it is. It is a tale that reminds us that to be rural and poor does not mean that one lacks greatness of spirit and a vision for how life is to be lived.I liked the clean, straightforward quality of this lean but satisfying story of youth, love, loss and accomplishment. It felt real. The characters were well depicted and engaging. The author let them evolve and mature in ways that seemed credible given the time, place and opportunity afforded them. It made me wonder what the so-called American Dream really is all about.A quiet, insightful and engaging tale."
2,Gap Creek,"Can't deny that this has a good story line, but can't understand how an editor could let a writer get away with the numerous ""I said, he said, she said, Hank said"" which continues throughout the story. I am listening to an unabridged reading by Kate Forbes which is excellent except for the use of these ""I said, he said, etc."" Hasn't anyone else picked up on this? Will continue listening to the recording, but even my husband admits that the writing is terrible. Would appreciate other comments regarding this annoying repetition."
2,"Gap Creek, 'story of boring household chores'","I expected alot more from this book. Interesting only for its historical setting, and even that is not enough to hold the book. It seemed to consist of Julie's long and constant descriptions of household chores and hard work. It reminded me alot of the way that feminist theory has evolved - as an examination of the lives of women through the chores that they perform. But that is not a solid basis for a fiction novel, and probably lost on most people. Particularly those that rightly believe a book should HOLD INTEREST."
2,What's the point??,"This book gets off to a good start. The writing is good, the characters start off interesting and it seems the plot is going somewhere. But as I got to about page 200 (or 2/3 through the book) I began to wonder what the author was trying to say. What's the point? That life is hard and you just have to get through? I read one other review that complained that the character of Julie never changed. I have to agree with that. There was no growth for her througout the book. There was no character development, at least for Julie who is supposed to be the protagonist. And when you don't see growth in the character, all the hardships that are thrown in - the fire, the flood, the death of a child - they all seem pointless. I have to admit though, some passages were a joy to read for the description and the words used alone. But that doesn't make a book. Others liked this book. It left me scratching my head."
3,Appreciate what we have,"Robert Morgan did an excellent job of describing the period of the book. While this was not one of my favourite books, I did enjoy reading it.I can't imagine living in a time where even the simplest thing was such a difficult task! Morgan accurately portrayed the period that the book took place in, and painted a clear picture of the work involved simply to ""get by"".Julie loses her Dad at a fairly young age, and she is expected to take on the brunt of the work, specifically the chores that would have been done by the man of the house. Julie and Hank meet, fall in love and get married. I think that Julie thinks that life will be somewhat easier for her once she is married. She and Hank move to Gap Creek, and she is suddenly faced with the reality that she must do as much or more as she did before. It is the story of a hard life, and of a marriage.I would be interested to read what had happened to Julie and Hank 30 or 40 years from the end of this book."
5,I was a captivating audience.....,"I've been bedbound due to illness for the past week and I'm glad I had this book to keep me company. No matter how bad I felt, I couldn't have been worse off than Julie. She had what we would think was a miserable life but, since she didn't know any better, it wasn't so bad for her. She did remarkably well with her resources and maintained her pitiful marriage. This was the ""story of a marriage"" and it was very well written. I'd like to see a movie made of it. My next book will be another Robert Morgan blockbuster...think I'll try The Truest Pleasure and see if it measures up. If you're feeling down and depressed, maybe wondering if your marriage/relationship will hold up, try reading this and see if it all still seems bad. I know I was thankful for my marriage, kids, money and being alive in this day and age after reading how it could have been. Recommended reading for all...."
2,*yawn*,"I found this book incredibly boring. At no time are you really encouraged to care about any of these people, none of them are particularly interesting, and nothing really happens. It's the dreary, grey, spiritless story of dreary, grey, spiritless people. The heroine has a touch of spunk and strength to her, which is cancelled out by her choosing to be a doormat for everyone. I kept waiting for something dramatic or inspiring or, well, interesting to break out. Never happened."
1,disappointed,"considering the magnitude of Bryn Terfel as a star, it's almost a let down. Granted the songs are beloved by some, still does not fully validate to create an album."
2,Sad decline,"Compared to the earlier DG disc in the same repertoire, and evaluated on an absolute standard of vocalism and style, this disc marks a serious decline in Terfel's voice -- frayed, pale lower notes, and lunging high notes (yikes, sad to say!) For artistry in the same repertoire, looks elsewhere. Terfel fans, beware...the glory days are over. It's all quite tired -- he needs a serious break to nurture his voice and enthusiasm."
4,Silent Noon,Silent Noon~ Bryn Terfel is a very well done recording of English songs. Terfel is a quite accomplished singer and vocalist but some of the tracks sound a bit alike and some of the lyrics are less then stellar. And sometimes his deep vocals some out of place with songs that were meant to be sung by amateurs and not opera singers and this becomes apparent on many tracks. The book-let is well done and the photos are nice (if a bit boring and his clothes look drab). Even so this is a good album not to be missed for his stunning (if sometimes over the top) vocals.
3,"Old figures, cool swoop","The figures in this set are all old and there are much newer versions of each of them. The only reason to get this set is for the swoop, which is exclusive. The swoop is pretty cool. I like the blue paint job (as opposed to the red Shadows of the Empire swoops). I'm not quite sure why there's a skull on the front but it looks great for a character like Aurra Sing. I do wish it could be removed though because it really would increase the versatility of the vehicle and allow it to be used for other characters. The biggest problem is that the seat is a bit too big for many figures. The older figures tended to have a wider stance and could straddle the seat better, but newer figures, even with their articulation, don't. The 2012 Aurra Sing figure fits, but it's a bit of a tight fit for her (you have to push her down a bit to make it look like she's sitting). It's too bad as otherwise this is probably the best Hasbro swoop toy out there."
1,Underdeveloped student of a poor teacher!,"One would indeed wonder how this poor playing finds its way onto a CD of a major label at a time when the classical recording industry suffers from overproduction and poor sales...that is if one does not read the liner notes carefully enough, or rather, between the lines of liner notes. It is clear that some Moscow based teachers have a tight grip on ""Denon"" and that is how poor playing gets on Denon CD's... amazingly along with such a phenomenal pianist from Russia like Valery Afanassiev. It is a shame that the names of these two underdeveloped musicians and average piano students - Irina Mejoueva and Constantin Lifschitz - could be on the same label with a major musical exponent of our time - Valery Afanassiev. There is something for Denon A&R people to think about! Both of these young piano students did not even learn to pedal properly, let alone complete absense of the sense of style and finger technique."
2,careless shipment,"The chair came damaged due to very poor packing. In response to request for discount, accompanied by photos of damage (top of the back and a foot), a 20% one was offered. It is not adequate, as this chair would not be worth $320 if offered for sale, but there was no point in arguing. After several experiences with receiving broken furniture, I don't think I'll be buying mail-order furniture anymore: too frustrating."
3,Needs more RAM !!!,Windows Vista is extremely slow with the notebook running 512 MB RAM. Consider upgrading to 1 GB or more.
4,Just a little more for 5 stars,"Pros: Great screen, super fast, super quiet(no fan noise),WiFi and plenty of USB ports.Cons: The only gripes I have is it only comes with 512 memory, no firewire port and there's too many Trial programs I don't want that run in the background that you have to uninstall or kill thru msconfig.I've had this laptop for around a week now and am really impressed and pleased with how it performs with only 512 memory on Vista which would have been plenty with XP. I'm not sold on Vista by any means. Great price at Best Buy for 549. For another 50 you can have 1 gig of memory and the total price is still under 600 bucks. Great deal!"
1,I would rate it 0 but it forces at least a 1,"I've owned 3 of these. Every motherboard has failed. 5 total returns. Check eBay for ""a135"" and you will see >100 with ""AS-IS"" or ""dead"" or ""bad motherboard"".Motherboards are prone to overheating and southbridge chip failure, on-board capacitor failure, USB ports all go out.The laptop run BURNING hot...and kills the motherboard."
1,Do not ! I repeat do not buy this computer,"When i bought my laptop it was my first time getting one (changing from desktop) i was unaware thinking if i stayed with a name brand it'd be good, Wrong! I chose this model and i payed around $850 so i was pleased. For a month or 2. I have had nonstop Problems with the Motherboard burning out consistently and yes i have upgraded it more ""Each"" time i sent it back to Toshiba (there customer support totally lacking) to have the motherboard replaced. after the third time doing this. I was pressured to extend the warranty which i didn't do because i was already so tired of the machine by that point i couldn't see doing that to myself. After it's warranty expired i had to sent it in to a repair shop and have the motherboard replaced 3 more different times and i've only had this computer a year and 3 months. so skip it,skip it please skip it and whatever you do don't buy one with the name Toshiba on it"
1,Toshiba Satellite 135 Problems (Don't Buy!!),I purchased this computer about 7 months ago. Currently I'm on my third mother board. The computer has been in and out of the shop roughly 9 weeks. Adding insult to injury I attempted to purchase extended warranty (since there are known problems) and Toshiba refuses to sell it because extended warranty is only available in the first 6 months of service. I have spent at least 20 hrs being bounced around Toshiba with no results. My case number is 1-854159549 in the event a person from Toshiba is reading this and wants to do something.... Don't BUY JUNK
1,Huge mistake for Toshiba,"These laptops were never meant to run Vista, and it shows.There are numerous fora on the Internet that are filled with people who bought various Toshiba A135 models and then began tearing their hair out. Adding more ram makes little difference. What DOES make a huge difference is to rip out Vista and install XP!I bought two of the single-processor A135 models in May and threw in XPpro. What a difference! Before, the units were mired in molasses; afterwards, they are very fast and wonderfully fluid. Don't expect to get any help from Toshiba, however. But if you use Google you will find various packages of drivers that make these machines perfectly functional in XP.So with a little bit of sleuthing I have two very quick laptops that cost me $400 each. Sweet."
1,0 Star!!,"The reviewers that gave this item 5 stars must not have received the same pool table I did! As soon as I pulled it out of the box 3 of the 6 pockets literally fell off! The screws that held the pockets to the MDF pulled right out. After inspecting the other pockets, they were about to do the same. But the kicker was slicing my hand open on the staples that were supposed to be holding the side rails on to the table. Instead, they had totally missed the table and were sticking out the side. The table itself was so thin and warped that the balls all rolled to the middle of the table. If I could have rated it a 0, I would have.The only positive was that the merchant gave me no trouble in returning, so I bought a better constructed mini table for my kids."
1,don't waste your money,I just received the item and it lasted all of 2 hours before the poor craftsmanship of the toy fell apart. The toy is held together by nails that come out of the particle board material used for the sides.Please do not waste your money!!!!
5,This is great!,It's not perfect but the kids like playing with. We have had this for a year and they still play with it.
1,I've been hustled,"Club Fun Tabletop Miniature Pool Table Toy / GameWhen purchasing this table it looked as if it were a good quality table,, but the first time it was used one of the short wooden legs cracked, it can be done easly, and now the game is tilted and, all the balls roll to one side. I feel I was hustled because the price originally was 160.00 dollars on sale for 44.00, was a different picture of the table that I recieved, because there is no way this one would go for 160.00. But when my son opened it on Christmas Day he was happy as for me I was happy for him, but dissapointed in the game."
2,Unhappy Unhappy Unhappy Unhappy Unhappy,It Came shipped very poorly and it had broken pieces. My kids have managed to make the best of it but it's not durable. It came with a broken leg and the rack was in several pieces and a piece was missing. Should have returned it. Not recommended to anyone. EVER
5,Nice quality and fun!,"I looked at a lot of tabletop products before deciding on this pool table for our 10-year-old son's birthday. We were worried that it would be too small or too rickety. But it's really pretty nice for the money. The balls feel like real balls. And playing on a smaller table doesn't change the fun or feel of playing pool. We like it; the kids like it ... unfortunately one of our cats like it, too, camping out on it and even knocking the balls into the pockets! :)"
4,Great little pool table,My 8 year old son got this as a gift and he loves it! He's always looking for a buddy to play pool with. It's a great little table just right for his size. We have it set up on his train table and it works great!
1,A big disappointment and expense.,"My camera is two months short of two years old and it is totaled. It has had regular power problems freezing up every couple pics. This problem started 1 year in just after the warranty ran out. I was told to remove batteries and card to ""Reboot"" it. That worked temporarly but now the camera does not work at all. It seemed reasonable [...] I took two hours with HP Customer Care and they determined it is totaled. They offered a refurbished camera for [...] but I'm not sure I want to invest any more money in an HP Camera product."
5,masterhit is master hit,"this is it, people. this is the song that pasted front 242 in the minds of ebm fans before ebm became popular. hey, if u have any intereset in ebm, you need this single. this single is probably tied with Headhunter as one of the band's most famous and best tracks. its been voted favorite song by all the other 242 fans at Target 242 rather consecutively. the heavy beats and invasively prominent tune, along with the familiar style of front 242 lyrics (with Jean-Luc's great voice!!) will glue this song in your mind forever. and if you like it, you should go for the album it was released on, which is Official Version (i think one of their greatest albums as well.) but if u haven't heard it yet, definietly get it somewhere."
2,"Aurora Plush 12"" Neptune Puppet","Very cute, but nothing special. Puppet kept falling off my hand and there is nothing inherently educational about the product."
5,Love this puppet!,"Very cute! I purchased it for my music and movement class. The children LOVED the puppet, very expressive and it certainly brought the ""Little Fish, Big Fish"" poem to life. There were other reviews on this puppet that swayed my decision to order it. The merchant sent it in a timely fashion. No complaints here."
5,Adorable and so much fun!,"My 6 yr. old grandson loves to play with puppets and this has been his all time favorite. He has determined the fish to be a male and insists on calling him ""Mable"". I love the creativity this toy has brought about and the hours of play and interaction involving my grandson and myself. Mable seems to have become part of our family and we have to consider what ""Mable"" would want to do in a lot of circumstances. This has allowed me to help teach many positive lessons to a young impressible mind."
4,Trini pleases yet again,This is a very good cd by the Master himself Trini Lopez. All tracks are worth a spin on radio. Great buy for the trini Lopez fans.
4,'The song remains the same',This album appears to have been reissued a couple of times:[1] compare:O Lusitano (1992)...[2] compare:O Lusitano (2001)...___________
5,Best Crackers,Just love these crackers - especially the Cinnamon Hearts!! Even my 22 month old granddaugher thinks they are a tasty treat.
5,CLASSIC JACKIE,"Jackie Chan 4 film setOperation CondorOperation Condor 2: The Armour Of GodJackie Chan's Project AJackie Chan's Project A Pt.2These are all 1.85 WideScreen,not the 2.35.1 they should befor Project A & Project A Pt 2The Armour of God and Project A are both Jackie Chan classics.The other two titles are also great entertainment.Recommended,and at the low price ,a bargain."
3,Catch some waves,"3 1/2Hancock was staying as true to title as any ambitious jazz man could in the early 60's, taking off into his own dimensions with this early boundary-breaker, a solidly hot, trippyily-bopped travelogue which for all classically honed moments does have experimental indulgences as well."
2,Complaint about the MP3 download sound only!!!!,It's awful. Really. If you like your jazz cymbals to have that fake digital tin-can icicle sound than this is for you....Poorly done. Maybe the CD is better(???). The music is great though. It's Herbie for goodness sake....
1,DISAPPOINTING AT BEST,"The book is largely a rehash of dated material. The information can all be found (free) on the internet itself. Alternatively, there are several more up-to-date, comprehensive, books in this gendre!"
4,Full of good ideas - the author's sources are very credible!,"This book is organized very well. The ""Constructing an on-line marketing business plan"" is excellent. The 101 Reasons to be on-line section will pay for itself. You will be able to attain financing much easier because the reasons are expressed clear and concisely."
5,Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are great together!,These movies have been a few of my best favorite movies. I love the interaction between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover its great. The craziness of Mr Gibsons character and the more straight laced and follow the rules of Mr Glover is comical. They get caught up in way more than they can handle yet they get the job done between them not necessarily legally mind you but done. Great stuff if you love action and comedy!
4,Good entertainment,"This one is not the best of the ""Lethal Weapon"" series. But the Glover-Gibson magic nonetheless is present here, and that plus some pretty good actions scenes and quite a few laughs cause this one to ignite into a real crowd-pleaser. This one dates itself with the bad guys being racist South Africans, but even so it is still good entertainment today.This is a good movie. It is just that I enjoyed LW1, 3, and 4 even more. One of them had to be my least favorite.The cop ""buddy theme"" movie is a tried and true formula, and this one takes it to its zenith. Joe Pesci provides the usual Pesci comic relief in this one, and the bad guys are certainly there for the viewer to righteously hate. So this one mostly has it all. Highly recommended. RJB."
4,Fun Action Flick,"Riggs and Murtaugh. Those eighties cop movies and cop buddy movies were great and few duos were better than Gibson and Glover as the odd couple pair of cops who start out hating each other, but grow into the best of friends as the series progressed.This second Lethal Weapon was just about as good as the first with several memorable scenes and moments. They sometimes blur together now, but I believe this one had the classic surfboard scene, the incredibly hot short haired blonde, and the racist South Africans. Diplomatic immunity?Well worth seeing and a great action film."
3,Lethal Weapon 2 [HD DVD],"As with the first Lethal Weapon (LW1) HD DVD transfer the picture and sound quality is not too bad, possible could be better but ok. I am rather dissapointed with the fact that there are no real extras on either this or LW1. I would of thought that as this is on HD DVD rather than just DVD they would of made the effort to put more extra features on considering the room, maybe the price should be lowered when they don't have extras. Apart from that it was good to watch the film again as it is possible my favourite of all of the LW films. I hope they will release the rest on HD DVD soon."
3,The Mania Continues,"Another action romp with Gibson and Glover. The obligatory explosions, car chases, and plenty of shooting. Mel Gibson fans will enjoy this flick. Plenty of humor along with the action."
2,"Reviewing the package only, NOT the movies.","Buyers should know that the widescreen aspect ratio listed for LETHAL WEAPON 2 and LETHAL WEAPON 3 are incorrect. They say they're 1:85.1, when they are actually 2:35.1. I found this out the hard way, after I'd opened the package.It's very, very disappointing not to be able to rely on the information provided by the DVD manufacturer!"
4,THE 2ND LETHAL WEAPON,This time RIGGS AND MUTAUGH must shut down the operations of a south african drug dealer
4,RIGGS AND MURTAUGH ARE BACK!!,The sequal to the blockbuster action hit LEATHAL WEAPON WHERE this time RIGGS and MURTAUGH must protect an eye witness from the same Afican drug lord they are trying to shut down.
4,Going After the South African Bad Guys,"Do you like lots of violence, steamy scenes, and going beyond police duties to get even with the bad guys? Then this movie is for you. The white South Africans are the bad guys. They dodge anti-apartheid protests, pay for drug deals with Krugerrands, hide behind their diplomatic immunities to avoid police action, and then bump off the police investigators one by one. One investigator's wife is murdered. Another investigator dies when jumping off a diving board that blows up. Still another must remain seated on a toilet bowl to which a bomb has been wired. Finally, the South African bad guys intend to escape on a ship that is about to leave port. So the drama continues..."
4,MIGHT POSSIBLY BE BETTER THAN THE FIRST!,"THIS TIME, RIGGS AND MURTAUGH RETURN TO FACE SOUTH AFRICAN DRUG RUNNERS WHO HIDE BEHIND DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY. THIS MOVIE, LIKE THE FIRST, HAS GREAT ACTION, GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR, AND GREAT PLOT. AND THIS MOVIE JUST MIGHT BE EVEN MORE ENTERTAINING THAN THE FIRST! WHICH IS VERY RARE IN MOVIES. JOE PESCI IS GREAT AS LEO GETZ, THE MAN THAT RIGGS AND MURTAUGH ARE ASSIGNED TO WATCH OVER SINCE HE'S TESTIFYING AGAINST THE DRUG RUNNERS. THIS MOVIE IS TOO GOOD TO MISS. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET OR IF YOU HAVEN'T BOUGHT IT YET, I'D ADVISE YOU TO DO SO. YOU'LL DEFINITELY GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH."
4,Lethal Weapon 2,"The second instalment of the popular action franchise is not quite as good as the first, but its still exciting frenetic fun, with some witty humour. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are the partner- in -crime duo again, and this one sees Riggs and Murtaugh joined by Joe Pesci as Leo Getz, the exasperating cop who returns in parts 3 and 4. The action is as impressive as the former one, and director Richard Donner's hard- as-nails approach to the film makes it as exhilarating as it's predecessor. The DVD's extra features aren't that good, with a couple of trailers and some additional `bonus footage'. But then, the film's good, so the lack of supplementary features isn't that bad. Good movie, so-so extras."
4,DANGEROUS!,"Lethal Weapon 2 is the sequel to the successful action film LETHAL WEAPON (1987). LETHAL WEAPON 2 brings back America's favorite cops, Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh. This time around they have a new assignment, Leo Getz (Joe Pesci). The very entertaining sequel lives up to its predecessor and its name. Riggs is no longer suicidal, but very wild and has almost healed from the tragic death of his wife, whom he will never forget. Murtaugh the family man is also still there and now he has another reason to be protective of his children, which is his daughter, Rianne's commercial debut. Both men are back in action and I think this film as well as the next two sequels prove very well that Riggs and Murtaugh are not too old for this [stuff]!"
3,"Should have been better than LW1, but it isn't.","This is a weaker sequel to Lethal Weapon (obviously) but although it has more action, more laughs, and possibly a better plot, it has Riggs having an unnecessary romance with Patsy Kensit (of all people) which I found contradicted everything you learned about Riggs in the original."
2,How many times can you say F#$@,"I could not believe how many curse word / minute this move used; WOWThe acting was good but the producer just did not even care, An Un-powered nail gun?, the drivers side door was knocked off then it was back on but the rear passenger door was shown to be off?.I can't believe how bad this is compared to Lethal Weapon 1I am a sailor and I don't curse as much as these guys in the first part of the movie, I guess the 80s were not as I remembered them.In an case the acting is a 5 StarThe picture quality is goodBut the directing, language and story consistency was very sadly lacking :( I did not remember this from when I watched it in 89."
2,Preachy Preachy Buddy Feel Good Mullet,This one had a lot of what made the first one good (action and violence) but it got a little too preachy (dolphins and South Africa) and a little too Three Stooges buddy buddy goofy ha ha for me. Mel hams it up so bad that it is really obnoxious and takes away from the movie. And he and Danny Glover have developed a homoerotic love fest between them for this one. The villians are still good and the violence and action are still exciting and also the hot chick that of course is drawn to Mullet Gibson at first sight is also hot and nude in one scene. Aparently Mullet must be on Lexapro or Lamictal in this one cause he is no longer wanting to blow his brains out but still just acts like and obnoxious blabber mouth who is trying to be the biggest ham on the police force.
2,cursing was a huge turn off,i got this for my husband as a christmas present. i watched these with my dad as a kid (the TV version) and didn't enjoy it as much as i remember. plus the F word was mentioned maybe 50 times in the movie. a turn off for sure.
5,Great movie,This looked great on HD-DVD. I can't wait until everyone moves to HD-DVD so the prices get even better.
1,Wouldn't Play,"Tried playing this DVD in 5 different players (yes, all HD) but it wouldn't play. The disc itself looked like it had been burned and damaged - had a cloudy effect on 1/2 of it."
3,"good action, laughable South Africans","Great action movie.I liked the introduction of Leo Getz.However,as a genuine South African,I must say that the accents used by the baddies were appalling (more Dutch and British than South African)- except of course for Joss Ackland, who is also a genuine South African. I'd also like to point out that not all white South Africans are racists.In actual fact, it was strictly forbidden for anyone belonging to the international Diplomatic Corps to EVER use derogatory terms against blacks, even in the worst days of apartheid"
1,Terrible,"This is without a doubt the worst DVD I have ever seen. The plot is non-existant, the acting terrible and the action is understated.This film is even more boring than Priscilla Fresh Queen of the Desert, worse it gives a distorted and one sided view of the South African situation by portraying white South Africans as racists and making no reference to the gross human rights attrocities commited by the racist ANC in its' grab for power.One would think the directors would know better than to make one sided derogatory films such as this."
5,Poetry with a punch!,Compelling poetry. Spellbinding plot. Stunning descriptions. And all in a fast read. Don't miss this beautiful book!
1,Disappointing,I received an advance copy to review for my state's review sessions. The characters are so lightly drawn that I didn't care about them. The book seems to imitate Out of the Dust in style and format but it doesn't begin to measure up. I work as a school librarian and I can't think of to whom I would give this book. Depressing. Skip it.
3,A Bit Disappointed,"I had used ""The Firm Cross Trainers Firm Cardio"" video for a while. I love the style of The Firm, so I decided to purchase the other Cross Trainer tape (Firm Strength) and the Tough Cardio Mix. I thought I'd use the Cross Trainers for strength building and the Tough Cardio Mix for a more aerobic work-out. Some of the Tough Cardio Mix is straight from the two Cross Trainer tapes (focusing on strength). I didn't feel that I got much of an aerobic workout using this tape and found the frequent change of instructors annoying. I'm glad I purchased the two Cross Trainers but wish I'd skipped this tape."
3,Way too easy for advanced steppers and exercisers!,"First I have to say, that although I like several of The Firm's fitness tapes, this is not a favorite of mine. One of the things I disliked most about the video is that it is cut and paste tape with parts being taken from several other previously released Firm tapes, and put together on this one tape, rather than being a completely new workout in itself. Also, the workout, although approximately 45 minutes in duration, did not get my heart rate up high enough to burn fat, and improve heart conditioning. The step routines are dull and repetitive, as are most Firm stepbox routines, and the floor aerobics is lacking when it comes to fun factor as well. If you insist on using The Firm for cardio...then I would recommend The Firm's Cardio Burn, as this is one of the few Firm tapes I have found that gets the heart rate up there, and works up a sweat. The Firm is great for scultping, but not for cardio, especially this tape."
4,Great for a devotional book,"Mother Teresa shares her heart and wisdom in this God honoring book. Though meant to be an inspirational book to guide the reader to love, pray and serve, the book also is laid out in a way that would lend itself to be an excellent devotional book, I'm not Catholic, but this book trancends denominational boundries. Mother Teresa shows her love of God and inspires the reader to serve with love, and not on a grand scale but by serving your neighbor and those in need. The book is a quick read. The first 3/4 of the book changed my life. The biography and interview with Mother Teresa was the ony drawback. I felt it took away from wisdom and inspiration that Mother Teresa was imparting. I would highly recomend this book. I will be reading this again."
5,A great Value,"The RCBS Partner Press has been described as an entry level press but I've been reloading for nearly 30 years and mine handles full sizing of rifle cases with the same aplomb as my Rockchucker. It's easy to use and incredibly durable - big performance in a compact package.This press is a lot of bang for the buck and it's covered by RCBS's lifetime warranty, not that you'll ever need it."
4,Durable & Classic appearance,"I have owned several place settings of this pattern for 8+ years. It has held up extremely well (no problems at all). I have not had any of the issues the previous reviewer mentioned as far as irregularities in finish or detailing, including my most recent place setting which was purchased 04/08. We have been quite happy with the silverware through many years & one toddler. While the shiny end of the forks & spoons are not quite as mirror like after 8 years, they are otherwise as good as the day I received them."
5,A family favorite,I recently purchased this book for a friend's grandkids because it was such a favorite in our house as my kids were at that age. They loved the pictures and the text is still in their heads a dozen years later! I hope when my grandkids come along I can read it to them.
1,In a Word: Terrible,"It is hard to imagine William Hurt in a film that is absolutely terrible but he manages it in this lame vehicle. He even has trouble maintaining a Southern accent throughout the film, sometimes using one, sometimes not. Dennis Leary, the comic turned actor, is also wasted here but his onscreen time is very small. The plot is that Hurt's daughter, a mute ten year old, witnesses a murder in Amsterdam. For the rest of the movie, the villain's hit man tries to kill the girl. Not only can this ten year old manage to constantly foil a ""professional,"" but this hit man must have failed Hit Man School. He absolutely cannot do anything right in carrying out his job and cannot even manage to own a gun that works properly. Bottom line: steer clear of this one."
1,One of the worst movies ever made...,"We watched this because William Hurt USUALLY is a good actor. Not the case in this movie. What was this supposed to be? Was this a really bad comedy with an attempt at suspense, or a really bad suspense with some comedy mixed in? Regardless of the intent, the acting is weaker than a Freshman high school play, the plot is grossly anemic and the setting is meaningless. PLEASE don't rent, buy, recommend or even look at the box of this movie. If a ""friend"" recommends this to you as a great movie, make new friends!"
1,How the Mighty Have Fallen,"This is a must-see for anyone who wants to witness the depths to which a great Academy Award winning actor will travel. Also, it is a must-see to witness one of the most side-splittingly funny scenes ever filmed. Wait patiently until the end when the gurney falls out of the back of the ambulance. I laughed til I cried.It's difficult to tell whether this film was intentionally funny or just happened to turn out that way accidentally. The plot is delirious and the acting atrocious, but the city of Amsterdam has a great chance to shine and is perhaps the only star of this movie worthy of recognition.This film is worth seeing because of how incredibly bad it is. Like the accident you can't help staring at."
3,Movie set in Amsterdam,"An American businessman, played by William Hurt, takes his family to Amsterdam on a combined business/pleasure trip. While they are there his daughter, a mute, witnesses a murder. She is pursued by the murderers and shows courage and resourcefulness which would be extremely rare in a 10-year-old. There are some exciting scenes, but the acting on the part of Hurt and his screen wife, Meg Tilly, is not up to their usual standards. The movie pretty well depends on the special effects and they are not strong enough to maintain this film."
3,in need of more information,"I live in Europe which means region code #2. I have never had problems seeing any of my other non-region 2 DVDs (both in NTSC or PAL) on my lap top. But I could not get audio on this DVD because it demanded ""Dolby Digital Surround Sound"", which is not normal on a PC. However I was finally able to see the film on a code free DVD player connected to my digital flat screen TV. There should be more detailed basic technical information about the DVD on the purchase site."
1,Would have liked to have watched it,"When an utem is sold in America I would think it was so it could have been played in America. Have wanted to watch this DVD, thrilled I could buy it and so very disappointed that I couldn't watch it. But I did learn that there are zones where things come from and that lets one know wheather it can be played here."
5,WONDERFUL!,"This is one of the most touching films I have ever seen! It is heartwarming, soul warming and just downright teary eyed!"
4,interesting - based on a true story - wonderful dancing,"Very interesting story about a Chinese ballet dancer, more interesting because it's a true story (not a fictional character) - and because you get to see some great dancing (without having to sit through a full ballet).This little boy was taken from his family (an honor to them and opportunity for him) and given an extremely structured/strict life - no visits home, no smiles and hugs from his parents or siblings, just years and years of constant training. Fortunately ONE of his teachers had a good heart and gave him compassion and confidence and a passion for this profession he had no say in but came to love and excel in. It's a good story.When you see the situations some of these great artists were made in, it's no wonder why some defect when they get a taste of freedom and fame in America. And you understand how it's no small decision because it has serious consequences for all their loved ones left behind."
5,"Finally, a movie the whole family can enjoy!","I love this movie. There are several reasons but mostly because it's a full, true life story, that is told without all the bad language and gratuitous body parts shots that are not even necessary in most movies but are still added, for rating I expect. Also, although the story isn't very intriguing, which is to say exciting/suspenseful, it is a story of determination, hard work and success. And finally, there is the breath-taking dancing done by the young lead actor. The man can practically fly! I would recommend this movie to anyone that is interested in ""true story"", ""morally uplifting"" and ""cultural arts"". Also interesting is that the dancer in this movie is the son of the teacher of the original dancer."
4,"""I Want To Fly""","'Mao's Last Dancer' is an overall enjoyable film about true events in the life of Chinese ballet dance Li Cunxin that in my estimation makes it more watchable then if it were fiction. The dancing scenes sre amazing, but I found the acting to be rather stiff and the relationships explored dull and unemotional. Being based on a true story the plot also suffers from the same malaise that all such actual accounts do, the ending is already known so the possibility of manufacturing any cinematic tension, or anticipation is difficult if not impossible.My favorite segments of the story where those based in China showing Li's early years of training and the brief glimpses of what life was like during the Mao regime. Definitely the best part of the film.My rating: -3 Stars- as far as entertainment value goes / -4 Stars- as a true story and associated social commentary."
3,Gift,"I received this as a gift and even though the story was dated it was good, not great, just good, as I couldn't follow a couple of jumps in the film that were made between the dancers this Chinese ballet dancer partnered. However, the primary problem was that about 2/3 though it stop running and it tooked me at least 20 minutes, maybe 30 to get it going again. As it was suppose to be a new DVD that shouldn't have happened."
4,Wonderful !,Great dancing and wonderful story. Well acted and produced. A wonderful true story of this Chinese ballet dancer and his struggles with Communism and staying in America to dance.
5,Terrific!,"This was as great as I wanted it to be. I had the dvd and I enjoyed it, but the blu-ray made the dvd look only okay. What a great story it is about overcoming all odds to achieve your dreams."
5,Remarkable,"This is a really rare sort of film. It combines compelling storytelling with beautiful choreography in a way I haven't seen before. This isn't just a ballet movie, the plot is thoughtful, intriguing and never over-done. I don't want to give away too much, but I got teary eyed in the end, which I never do at movies, so that's saying quite something. I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys something a little unusual."
5,amazing,i have enjoyed it myself and shown to friends. an outstanding film. being a true story made it even better for viewing
3,Just Okay,"Descent kit that comes with multiple options. Would have been more useful if the puller had a die instead of the ball bearing, as this had to be removed and replaced with a make-shift die in order to remove the power steering pulley from a 2001 Expedition. Also, for the installer tool for the same pulley, the bolt stripped out completely smooth at the section inserted into the power steering pump. Used a different, stronger bolt with the installer section and heavy-duty nut to install. Took longer to find replacement parts for this kit than to remove the old and install the new pulley.Overall nice kit, but could have been made with stronger metal for the price."
2,Not Happy,"This Product the puller sleaves are to small to allow the Hold down band to fit over it. I had to grind down my puller to make it fit and work, this is not good cause now I'm stuck with a tool I can't return as a defect. I had no choice I work in a auto shop and the job needed to get done."
2,Slow moving and weak in spots,This book is not at all Anne Perry's best book. It moved very slowly and dwelled in the psychlogical profiles of the characters too much. I was not able to finish it. Definately a waste of time.
3,Not one of Anne Perry's best,"Sadly, Anne Perry seems to be losing enthusiasm - this latest in the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series started off badly and degenerated into a boring and tedious read. The usual cast of characters that were vividly portrayed in the previous Pitt books either made cameo appearances (Aunt Vespasia and Charlotte's mother, Caroline) or were conveniently absent (Charlotte's sister, Emily and her husband, Jack). Perry seems to have gotten hung up on the issue of militant feminism in this latest book, and this has severely impacted the ""detecting"" aspects that were present in her earlier books in this series. But all is not lost - Pitt's boss, Cornwallis, appears to have fallen in love - with the wife of a Bishop no less! Is this an echo of what happened to Pitt's previous boss - he fell in love with, and married, a widow? I hope that Anne Perry does better with her next Pitt book. Me - I would prefer Lindsey Davis's Falco series any day."
2,disappointing,"I gave this book two stars because I'm a loyal fan of Anne Perry and have come to care about the characters, but, frankly, this book just isn't worth the money. Instead of Charlotte, Emily and Aunt Vespasia sleuthing and spying all you get are endless dialogues about feminism and religion.I hope I'm wrong to fear the worst for this series but next time I'll definitely wait for the paperback edition....."
5,Full of Smiles,"Jim Parker brings truth and understanding to the average single male's mind. As an average single female, I found this book helpful and provided insites that made me think. I especially liked the chapter on 'The ASM and Eye Candy"". I never laughed so hard. It's about time someone 'tells it like it is'."
3,it was alrightt.,"timing wasn't that great, but it did come before I needed it luckily, I also got a different version of the book they were advertising, an older book but then again, thats what you get for a 1 penny book lol"
1,"One song is good, the album is not","My mother came across ""Way Down In The Hole."" She loved the song. I bought the CD for her for Christmas. That was the only good song. The rest was so awful that we had to turn it off while we were opening the rest of our gifts. We never did put it back in."
1,Should have Wait(ed),"As I have surpassed 700 cds in my library, I thought it was time to add some Tom Waits. I started with Closing Time and absolutely love it, but Frank's Wild Years is one of the WORST cds I have ever purchased. No soul, hokey tunes, not something I like at all. Perhaps Waits fans would like this but, as a Waits novice, I had to give this a second chance and I dislike it even more than when I first listened. This cd will go into my recycle pile. No camparison to Closing Time, absolutely none."
4,"i'd like to give this one another .5, but whatever","i was a bit nervous about getting this one, worried that its foundation as a musical might make it a weak album. i was wrong, big time. i mean, this guy just won't stop exceeding my expectations. there are many great waits-moments on here, but the best, and now one of my favorite TW songs ever, is the sweetly haunting ""innocent when you dream"". this album also flows seamlessly with its two predecessors, _swordfishtrombones_ and _rain dogs_."
5,"He makes all the mistakes, but....","A friend of mine describes Tom Waits as sounding like Bruce Springsteen with throat cancer! Tom's songs are filled with coughing, singing out of tempo, sour notes, and of course that horrendous voice of his. It's sort of like a garbage can's rotting contents of music. But dammit, it's really good! It's catchy, believe it or not - if you are not already a fan. Because he breaks all the rules it makes you wonder what it is that ""good"" music consists of. Mozart would probably tear his hair out if he heard it, but dammit, Tom Waits is really good!"
4,A Classic with Continuity,"This CD starts out with perhaps one of the best “road trip” songs of all time “Hang on St. Christopher” and continues taking you places for the next 16 songs. Of course, because it’s Tom Waits taking you there you are taking a trip into shattered dreams, self-destruction, alcoholism, and ultimately the cold, cold ground. The CD contains the song for a two-act play, so beyond the attraction of being one of his best recordings, it is also the most cohesive. Following Frank’s story from song to song is just as good a reason to buy the CD as the memorable tunes, brilliant lyrics, creative use of studio techniques, and diverse instrumentation. If I have one criticism, it is that Waits’ singing is sometimes too theatrical and melodramatic. It’s usually when he’s singing first person as Frank, but it helps to tell the story so it’s not out of place, per se. But “good” acting is when the audience is not conscious of the process of acting."
5,Best Of QuickSilver Messenger Service,"Having seen this band perform at the Family Dog in San Francisco in 1969 and again at Winterland in 1975, I can assure anyone who is interested in owning ths CD, it is a great buy. John Chippolina was one of the great guitarists of all-time. With a style all his own, the sounds he produces compare favorably with any of the great San Francisco axe men of the 60's and 70's. Anyone wanting more proof should go to YouTube. On the search line type in Quicksilver Messenger service/Fresh Air/Winterland 1975. Watch this live six minute performance and you will want to own this CD."
4,Another Ghost-Rider in the sky,Rocking rhythym and blues band which plays technically right-on. Rock of the ages to be appreciated by anybody who turned-on in this period. Pass-it-on!
3,2002 Pulitzer winner,"Practical Gods wouldn't have been my choice for the Pulitzer, but I can see how it won. While there are no poems that stand out themselves, the work as a whole is impressive. Carl Dennis explores spirituality, religion, and gods (both Christian and non-Christian gods) in this collection. It's a pretty solid collection and I would recommend it."
3,ho hum,"My apologies to Carl, but he really doesn't strike me as an important Pulitzer Prize-winning poet. I appreciate the mythic themes of this book, & some of his insights & ponderances, but for the most part it just doesn't feel...important. For instance, why should I care when this guy writes a poem about a novelist friend of his whom he supports? Hey I have friends who do things too. & Carl Dennis does do some clever things with rhythms, but I can't believe he's one of the greatest living poets. How did he wiggle his way so far into the spotlight? Personally I disagree with many of his quasi-logical statements anyways, even while I can appreciate what he's trying to do with them. I'm glad I got this book to see what's going on in Pulitzer poetry this year, but not because I think the book is too memorable."
3,barrette,"well made but I dont like the design so much. Its too big to be so curved, its looks kinda funny."
2,Beautiful but not for really thick hair,I have very thick shoulder length hair and have searched long and hard for a barrette that will hold all of it at the nape of the neck for a slightly classier ponytail. This is not that barrette. It did not even come close to closing over all my hair. It is a beautiful barrette but I am sending it back and continuing the search.
1,989 please tell me you're joking right?,"Where's the Defense?are you kidding me? whats so good about the D? Me and 2 of me friends where playing this game,man talk about bad gameplay! the cpu always knock the receiver down before the ball gets to you,and no flag?note: this only happen when i played with people on my team vs the cpu,another thing when you run the ball sometimes your running back,i don't know like your getting block like instead of getting tackle,its just that bad.man this game just sux, JUST SAY NO TO GAMEDAY! DON'T EVEN RENT IT!"
1,Major problems with GameDay 2002,"Up to this point I've been a fan of the GameDay series. I loved my GameDay 2000 for the regular Playstation. But the 2002 version for the Playstation 2 has two flaws that I came across. First, there's a bug in the game so that occassionally, when a team scores a touchdown, it says that the extra point (PAT) was missed even though the user never even had the chance to set up and kick the PAT. The second problem is that no one seems to be able to catch anything. I can understand missing a catch if the receiver is covered, but I rarely connect a pass even with those receivers who are wide open. An honest guess would be 20% of the passes I made were caught in this game -- when the receiver is open. I'm very disappointed with this game."
1,Another dud from 989! Are you the least bit surprised?,"I'm not surprised, at all! I knew that 989 Studios was going to stiffarm the hardcore football gamer and run with his/her money! Since these people haven't yet figured out how to create a quality and marketable football video game, I am sure that their fate as a game development studio is imminent! DO NOT BUY THIS WEAK FOOTBALL GAME....get MADDEN 2002 (EA knows what they're doing, and they're doing all the right moves!). I want to say something to all the RAIDER Nation faithful out there....GO RAIDERS!!....SILVER & BLACK Forever!! We will get some PAYBACK next season for that one important game that the officials took from us!! We're coming back!!!!"
3,Decent but pretty hard to beat!,I had high hopes for this game. the graphics are pretty good but this game is pretty hard and I have it on easy and made the cpu with the lowest ratings and I get beat or barely beat them.
4,Good game,"I see this game is not getting very good reviews, but I dont understand why not because it is a harder game, which makes it more fun, and more challenging, and also it is not just a throw it, catch it with no problem game, you have to work hard to get what you want in the game.... I think it is more realistic, pretty good graphics... I suggest this over any football game this year"
4,No Topless Scenes for Michelle Trachtenberg [alas] !!!!,"You might as well know right now, that Michelle Trachtenberg didn't appear topless in the unrated DVD version of the film, even in the nude beach scene. Too bad, though!!! She isn'tlarge breasted like a lot of silicone implanted actresses, and because of that, I think she's hotter than most of them, though."
5,EuroTrip,"Eurotrip (Unrated Widescreen Edition)This movie is awsome ! It is funny on so mny levels that I can't begin to describe it. It is one of the best High School road trip movies ever made.Watch it, you won't be sorry."
4,Hilarious,Just plain fun. Nothing to serious going on in this movie. If you are looking for a great laugh and can tolerate some foul language and nudity then this movie is for you.
5,Eurotrip,"Una pelicula muy graciosa y llena de pensamientos creativos para la juventud en la que nos enmarca dentro de una aventura que generalmente no nos gusta realizar pero en ciertas etapas de la vida es bueno hacerlo y no ser tan ""predecibles"" con nuestros actos"
2,Funny......ok not really,"Eurotrip was suppose to be funny as hell. It wasnt. Well for meit wasn't. Its not the best or greatest comedy I've seen but its stupid enough to make you laugh like a bit. The plot was stupid and cheezy. THIS GIRL FROM OUT OF NO WERE DOESNT EVEN NO THIS GUY AND SHE WANTS TO BE WITH HIM! Unless all german girls are really like that than never mind about it. The movie wasn't as good as rode trip I can tell you that. The characters were lame and stupid. The stories ending didn't make me really enjoy the movie. I hate it that all teenager flicks alway have to make an ending when the main character gets the girl. Why cant they make a different ending wich lets you think and say ""thats not how I pictured it"". Well if you wanna pay nine bucks for this crap be my guess. I shouldn't have but you make the dessision.I recommend you watch Club Dred. That will funny."
5,Absolutely funny!,his movie is hilarious it is the VERY FEW movies me and my boyfriend can agree on watching together. Bought the DVD from amazon and we watch it over and over.
5,Satisfied customer,"The product was as described. It was new and in the original packaging. I appreciated the prompt delivery. Great (silly) movie! If you like American Pie, you'll love Eurotrip."
4,It's Worth A Look Because. . .,". . .ANY film in which Michelle Trachtenburg removes any article of clothing is worth watching, if not buying and watching again, and again, and again. . ."
3,"Europa, Europa","While nothing original, Europtrip is a fun and entertaining movie. It's the standard gross-out teen comedy ala American Pie and Road Trip, but it's set in Europe. In fact, the original script was called Ugly Americans, but it was later changed so fans of Road Trip would find similarities in both titles and want to see this. That pretty much sums it all up. If you're a fan of those two films, you will be a fan of Eurotrip. If not, steer clear."
4,"""EuroTrip"" Amongst the classics!","I have to admit when I first saw this movie in theaters I couldn't stop laughing. The movie reminds me of how far facht our Highschool perogitive on life were. I can remember friends of mine talking about drinking worm wood or smoking weed in Holland. But the main point I feel is how the movie relates to each one of us. Maybe we as highschool graduates or alumni yet to come can't relate to drugs, drinking, travel, or even parting. But instead relate to adventure. The adventure of walking off the stage and going into the real world and trying to put some of the studies to the test. This is what makes Eurotrip so rememberal.~jamesralex~"
5,one of the best comedy movies,"i remember watchin this movie back in 2004 and was completely blown away ,i couldnt stop laughing and was entertained the entire 90 minutes ,that was the sorta impact it had.it didnt bore me even for a single minute.everyones acting was perfect,no other movie has made me laugh as this one except for american pie .if u havent seen this ,then the first thingz u should do is grab a dvd edition of this one.i liked the scenes in vatican boy dat was so funny(the new pope :).. awesome movie ,100% a complete entertainerand did i 4get 2 mention the soundtrack of the movie aha go get dat one n first listen to ""cotty doesnt know"" coz da songz a killer.p3ace euro strippers and the pope"
3,Eurotrip is a Trip,"If you don't set your expectations high...this movie is just the ticket! Entertaining, funny, juvenile, and insane, Eurotrip makes for a silly movie that will make you laugh at the outright inappropriateness rampant throughout the film."
4,"Good acting, good humor!","This is actually a pretty funny movie. It is very similar to films like American Pie, Road Trip, and Harold and Kumar, but doesn't surpass the laughability of those films. This is a worthwhile film if you are up for some funny lines and physical gags.To get the full 'road trip' experience, I suggest you watch ""Hostel"" after ""Eurotrip""."
5,i loved the movie,"i so loved this movie. it was so funny. i like when the guy had the thing around his chest with the passports and maps in it and when the mugger came at the wrong time when he was getting oral the mugger thought he was telling him that he loved him but he really was talking to the girl. and i like when they drunk so much the twins made out. i like when the guy went through all that stuff to get that t-shirt. i like when michelle tragenberg bent over in the movie and the guy thought it was another girl because u know they don't think of her as a girl. i also like when the men was on the beach and they had those little pennis' i was crakkin' up at thet theater, and when she about to get nude. THE REAL REASON I WENT TO SEE THE MOVIE IS BECAUSE MICHELLE PLAYS IN IT AND IM A BIG FAN OF HERS, AND IT ALSO LOOKED EXCITING. Thank u"
2,Thank God for Hitler,"Mathew CarlWell, the movie started off by being totally amazing. It slowly drifts in to a story about a German girl named Mieke and Scott a beautiful love story. The movie ends up becoming a story about a robot, some drunken British people, some weird Spanish guy, naked men, insest, and last but not least Hitler. Although the movie takes some crazy [caraaaazzzzyyyyyy]twists and turns it all turns out to be a terrefic movie with a great ending. My original review gave this movie a negative 2 out of 10 but Hitler boosted it up to a 4. So thank you Hitler."
2,"MILDLY JOVIAL, CONVIVIAL, BUT UNRELENTINGLY TRIVIAL","Hormone-riddled yank teenagers take a gropefest tour to the EU. The general theme has been beaten to death in a bunch of other much funnier movies but apparently someone thought it has not been covered clearly enough. Despite this reservation, I rented this DVD for the sole claim that it included writers from the 'Seinfeld' team.Bad decision. The movie is grounded in drivel and delivers much the same odor. As though the handful (literally, if you get the drift) of raunchy scenes and absolutely idiotic props such as a computer that pronounces the arrival of email with "" Mail, muthafukker"" were not enough to scrape the bottom of the trench of tastelessness, we are inflicted with a Vatican City sequence involving dead-pontiff jokes and some leering copulation in a confessional.What can I say. Grossed-out, uninspired knockoff that can be skipped without missing much, unless you need a background for a particularly adoloscent stag party."
1,this movie is horrible,"This movie is horrible, there is nothing funny about this movie. It tries to hard to be funny and it never is. The jokes are stupid and the movie tries too hard to be just like Roadtrip. This movie is not even close to being as funny as Roadtrip. Roadtrip is a classic and this movie is crap."
1,The hooligans saved the movie.,"The romp-across-Europe sequence in ""The Rules of Attraction"" was much more entertaining and exciting."
3,It's No American Pie,"""Eurotrip"" is simply a re-hash of the teen ""gross out"" comedies popular in the last five or so years. It takes little pieces of movies such as ""American Pie,"" ""Road Trip,"" and ""Old School,"" then ties it all together with a new storyline. While I admit the movie has its hilarious moments, its simply more of the same. The downright repetitiveness from past films is somewhat annoying, and the acting, having a relativley undiscovered cast, is pretty weak. On a more positive note, the DVD's production quality seems good, and will make for a quick burst of entertainment. It's been done before, but its still worth a rent at Blockbuster just to have some laughs."
2,No Trachtenberg Nudity,"Call me sick but I thought Michelle Trachtenberg was going to show off some skin. And I do mean T&A. I went out and spent money on this thing to see that and only that, but I was let down. Both ways!!! All this was, was another American Pie rip-off."
4,Good movie if you like teen sex comedies style,"It is a funny movie and a classic at the height of American Pie, Road Trip and Old School.Just to give you an idea if I had to compare all the previously mentioned movies and Euro Trip i would put them like this:1) American Pie2) Old School[Not really sure if I like old school or american pie better thou :/]3) Road Trip4) Euro Trip[I'm again at a pickle between Road and Euro Trip :/]Some female nudity (topless only) and some male nudity (front and back), so homophobics, be warned :)"
4,whopee,This was very good flick. After watching you could just skip to the nude parts. The nude male beach was disgusting except for the sister in the bikini.
4,Awsome movie,eurotrip was a great movie that took you on all these wacky misadventures in europ as scoot tomas searched for his dream girl who lived in berlin he an his friends go on a sex crayzed joy ride if you like the american pie movies your love eurotrip
4,Just really funny!,"Okay. It's not Citizen Kane. It's not The Bicycle Thief. I get really tired of ""critics"" not giving comedies the accolades they deserve because they were silly or goofy. It's a COMEDY! Lighten up! If you don't take it too seriously, this movie is a riot! From ""Scotty Doesn't Know"" sung by Matt Damon, to the soccar hooligan opening beer bottles with his eye sockets, to the 'safe word"", to the great exchange rate in Bratislava, this movie had me in tears I was laughing so hard.The actors are all very good, especially Michele Trachtenberg, who shows some great skin along with great comedic timing and expressions. This film is sill, goofy and full of sterotypes taken to the furthest level but always in the name of good fun. I had a great time watching this film. Critics really need to adjust their thining on comedies."
1,this movie sucks,"This movie was so stupid I turned it off after seeing that girl in the hot tub take off her top, that was rediculous, no girl is that stupid. This movie makes all women look like brainless idiots when in fact the people that make these movies that make women look stupid are the brainless idiots!!"
2,God Americans are dumb!,"There are a few funny moments in this film and there is a lotof topless scenes which just about saves this film.But I mean really; football fans dress up like pirates? It's no wonder that the American reviewers find no fault with this film because only 1-2% of them have passports but for anyone who understands what the word geography means you will be too sidetracked by the juvenile stereotypes to really enjoy this film.Most of the time you will be thinking to yourself:- ""how pathetic""."
1,A Shameless Movie for the Shameless Generation,"I don't know about y'all, but this movie is questionable. It features the hedonistic adventures of teenagers taking a trip to Europe (with absolutely no parental permission and/or awareness.) What does that say about American parenting, huh? Secondly, you observe the protagonist teenager having sex with his German pen-pal, and later on they move in together as dorm-mates. In another words, they become co-habitators. And it is this huge misconception and terrible value that sky-rockets our national divorce rate to about 75%. I don't know what message the producers of this movie are trying to convey to our teenagers; whatever it is, however, let shame be upon them!"
1,Pubescent trash for the masses,Tasteless trash trying to titillate teens!NOT recommended for anyone with real family values or hopes of avoiding the pitfalls of the path of satan.This movie says alot about the morals of young people all around the world.Teens who would make fun of a curious and intelligent young man who wants to see churches in europe.Teens who would drink alcoholic beverages illegally at unsupervised parties.Teens who would engage in incest while under the influence of an illegal substance.Teens who would use violence against a street performer to earn money.The list goes on and on until this perversion is completed when you need to scrub your skin with hot water to cleanse yourself of the layer of filth it leaves upon the mind body and soul.The sole star is for the brief but welcomed geography lessons.
1,Complete & utter waste of time,"My God, this movie was lame! The whole premise of the film is so unbelievable it's rediculous. A few of the jokes are mildly amusing, but not enough to actually laugh just smirk. Most of them, however, are just plain stupid. Granted, Michelle Trachtenberg looks incredible in a bikini & evening gown, and there are plenty of topless women to keep the depraved entertained. But if you're looking for actual enjoyable humor, a plot that makes sense, or something even remotely resembling intelligent film work, then this is definitely not the film for you."
1,Americo-trash,"This is the dumbest, most predictable, horrible waste of time i've ever ever seen. This movie tried very very hard to be funny and simply wasn't. It took a pretty good idea and butchered it by cliche jokes and feel good high school humor that's supposed to encourage all of us angsty youngings to go to europe, drink, and copulate with any random gorgious blonde that happens to walk past us. After watching this movie I felt incredible stupid and regret being apart of a culture that could make such main stream trash. my only hope is that our european friends didn't seen this for it would most certainly cause an international incident."
3,Very Entertaining,"Although this movie doesn't beat the old ""European Vacation"", it still has a couple of scenes that had me falling out of my chair laughing. I definitely recommend it as a solid comedy."
3,Surprisingly funny.,"Rent\purchase this film and leave your brain at the door. You can expect it to be puerile, lowbrow, and at times outlandish.The good-The little German boy drawing a square moustache under his nose, and doing an impression of a famous World War 2 dictator.The bad-The nude beach scene was wrongheaded. There was just no reason.The Ugly-The twin brother and sister getting loaded on absinthe and voraciously making out.If you like films like Porky's, American Pie, and other outrageous teen-comedies, this one is for you."
5,"{some} indecent exposure, but still good","Eurotrip was alright for a movie that has stuff in it you don't often see like a nude beach with all guys.When I first saw that, I was a little disturbed, but now I guess I'm ok with it. There are many naughty scenes.I thought Fiona was pretty hot in the beginning! Don't mind the naughty stuff, this is altogether a good one that belongs in your video collection."
3,Eurotrip,"This predictable but sometimes funny movie finds Scott and some friends heading to Europe for the summer to find his e-mail pal Mieke and to declare his love for her. Oh yeah...he had previously mistook her for a guy and told her off, so there is somewhat of a time factor involved, but that doesn't seem to speed things up too much for the gang. They find themselves travelling pretty much all over Europe, getting into bad situations that include a nude beach, an anal probe, and a brother and sister make-out session. This movie does not work enough for me to recommend seeing in the theaters. It is about middle of the road for road trip-gross out movies."
5,A Great fun movie,This was a great movie. It was funny all the way through. They were not afraid to show nudity which is something that seems to be avoided by other comedies. It was a great movie.
2,Didn't I see this movie before?,"Oh yeah, that's right I did. It was called American Pie.Rehashed comedy. Can't they think of something new to make us laugh, or an interesting idea. An average of 4 stars! You must be kidding me.No originality at all.No, they must go through the teen movie cliche check list:Guy loses hot girlfriend (check)Foreign girl loves American guy ( check)Wild party attended with friend ( check )Friend gets beat up by jocks (check)Guy sees ex-girlfriend with another guy (check)Guy messes up ""relationship"" with foreign girl (check)By friend's advice, guy goes to try to fix things with foreign girl (check)Foreign girl doesn't seem to mind that she doesn't know Guy at all, but still loves him (check)Guy's friend makes it with another girl (check)We have all components in check sir. We are ready for liftoft."
4,Worthwhile but not life changing,"I bought this CD audiobook edition. I read her book, Organizing From the Inside Out, first. I am still reaping the benefits of a much better organized workspace several months later. The same ideas are retrofitted to deal with time management. I found the book worthwhile because it gives a fresh perspective on time management by borrowing ideas from organizing principles. But they are separate challenges. Some ideas from the book are likely to have a positive impact, but not the transformational impact that can be achieved from the other book. So, expect about as much from this as the other decent books on time management, no more, no less."
5,"Excellent, don't requiered to cut wires =D","plug and play!! off the original connector Honda Civic's 08 sedan and connect it, and rock and roll"
3,Interesting,"Not quite what i expected, but there are some very interesting examples of Jewish thought. I really expected it to expound more on the Bible."
3,Good book,It was a good book. This book taught me some things that I've never learned anywhere else. I would recommend this book to someone who would like to understand hebrew tradition.
3,Mediocre Movie....Hot Hot Girl!!,"Not the greatest movie, and Patrick Bergin is generally better at playing a bad guy than he is at playing a good guy, but Annie Dufresne who plays the hot French female co-star of the movie is so hot that she makes this movie worth watching. The plot of this movie was forgettable, but it left me wanting more Annie Dufresne, so I googled her and it turns out that she is French Canadian and is a pretty big star in Quebec, In addition to acting in Quebec based movies and TV, she is a very talented musician/singer/songwriter who has rock albums with both French and English songs in her own name and also has some really cool Electronic/techno type music under the name Electro Lise. Her video, which you can find online, for her song ""Cousin Sex"" is really good and funny and best of all she is in a country Daisy Duke type outfit looking so sex it is just not fair."
4,"Madness is not ""Tickety-Boo""","Snake Pit is a good read if you want insight into the world of the insane. I never understood what actually set off the madness in Virginia Cunningham (was it her husband's inability to show concern or adequately provide - or was it before her actual marriage when she lost her first love)? What happened that first landed her in the hospital and then a mental institution? How did shock treatments help her cope and what behaviors set off the need for ""packs"" to bring her back into the real world? I know this is a period piece and things were done differently then to treat the ill and this is why the book was an interesting read. I never felt Mrs. Cunningham was anywhere near well but I couldn't tell how actually sick she really was. It was a snakepit!"
5,Our Future Self,"Aurobindo is a golden Vessel. His words convey thoughts of the most sublime and supreme that a human is given to think and become. His depth of realization and breadth of learning continues to leave me aghast. This magnum opus dethrones and perfects the intellect, opens the being to higher ranges and transmissions to the effect of developing the necessary mental architecture for the radical uplift and trans-human amplification."
5,this book is good for women,it speaks about virginity and methods used to verify it it speaks about hymen as one of those method.
5,Great Markers!,"These are THE ""industry standard"" permanent markers. No other marker comes even close. You will not be disappointed!To the previous review, please do not use these markers on your CD's, they can damage the top layer of your cd and eventually make it unreadable. Use specific CD Markers for writing on CD's. For everything else, use these!"
5,Permanent!,"I love this markers, I use them everytime I want to label my cd's... Plus, they come in 4 different colors, wich make my cd's very unique!!!"
1,permanent marker... on your CLOTHES.,in all honesty I have bought different markers from sharpie about 4 seperate times and I am dissapointed every time. Twice the back end exploded and ruined some expensive clothes with permanent marker ink. And the other times they have dryed out in less than a week. I would like to give these a good rating but I just can't recommend these to anyone wanting to buy a quality product.
3,Slightly Disappointed,"If I were looking at this place setting for the first time I might like it. However comparing it with my stainless steel set purchased in the 1970's, I am slightly disappointed. The length is the same, but the balance of the spoon is not quite right. The look of the new setting is not as nice as the original, as it lacks the same quality of detail. I am obliged to keep the new setting because I need a replacement, but I must say that the Oneida company should have the same pride in their product now as they did then."
4,"Ok but, not the best",The first one was much better but my four year old love them and she us the true judge so four stars.
5,Land Before Time DVD,My daughter and son love Little Foot and the rest of the Gang. This set introduces new characters. My daughter likes that Little Foot has a new friend who is a long neck also. Great stories and songs. If your kids love the Land Before Time movies than they will like this one too.
1,Scary for young children; name-calling and teasing,This series of videos is scary for young children. Do not let the G rating fool you. I watched the video with my three year old son who loves dinosaurs and he was scared during several of the scenes. Also there is a lot of name-calling and teasing in the videos. Not something I want my child learning. Very poorly done story lines. Pick Dinosaur Train or Dino Dan instead!
2,Way too scary for an almost 3 year old,Our son is just too young to be exposed to that many scenes where fear and violence are a major componant. Maybe when he gets older and is able to have a better understanding of what is going on and does not get as scared as easily as he does now we will try this series again.
5,Fantastico relato de lo que realmente somos,"Soy de Argentina y he visto mucha de esta idiotes de que habla el libro, por suerte no viví los años de gloria del peronismo ya que soy muy joven pero leer la verdad que aca nadie se atreve a decir, precisamente por la idiotes que nos caracteriza, me produjo una gran satisfacción. Cuando un pueblo entero apoya el despilfarro y la ""navidad permanente"" como dice el libro, ya no hay nada más que agregar, simplemente pobre de nosotros."
1,"Una estrella , porque no encontre valores menores a cero.","Bueno este libro no es mas que lo que su titulo anticipa , ya que para estar interesado en el hay que ser un verdadero idiota.Es una verdadera basura , lo que no puedo creer es que sea mas costoso (y su papel mas aspero) que un rollo de papel higienico por lo tanto no le he encontrado ningun uso practico hasta el momento.Aguante Galeno , y todos quienes nos ayudan a darnos cuenta de una realidad que tantos se esfuerzan por ocultar ."
1,"attacks people, not ideas","The authors are obviously on the payroll of Latin American elites who run their economies for the benefit of the few.The book does a bad try in attacking the excellent Open Veins of Latin America. They attack a fictious character that does not exist, the 'idiot'. They do not attack the ideas of Galeano, they just can't come with good arguments against historical facts and truths.One of the few buts that I would place on the 'Open Veins of Latin America' is that in could generate hate in a continent that needs to forgive and forget to move forward."
1,Ahora el perfecto Idiota es Alvaro Vargas Llosa...,"Leí el libro con bastante entusiasmo hace muchos años cuando estaba en la Universidad y me parece bueno. Y me animé a dar una critica, mas que todo por qué uno de los autores del libro, Alvaro Vargas Llosa, se contradice totalmente con su actual apoyo al candidato a la presidencia del Perú, Ollanta Humala. En el libro critica el caractaer estatista y nacionalista de ciertos lideres politicos, siendo Ollanta Humala la viva encarnación de estas ideas actualmente en el Perú. Recomiendo el libro, ya que tiene ideas interesantes, pero no se le debe tomar tan en serio, ya que uno de los autores no es consecuente con lo que plantea en el libro."
2,Quienes son los idiotas?,"Encuentro fantastico que 3 autores sean los duenos de la verdad absoluta y los que no piensen como ellos son idiotas. Esta actitud elude todo comentario que se pueda hacer de su libro, si no estas absolutamente en acuerdo eres calificado de idiota.Pienso que personas intelectuales deben tener una mente mas amplia, pero me equivoque, los idiotas regresaron en ""El Regreso del Idiota"""
1,"pesimo libro, pero util para ver la ideologia de los idiotas enemigos de LA (los autores)","Pesimo libro que es un mensaje negativo sin base historica ni sociologica ni metodologica. Una perdida de tiempo. Para saber algo sobre los latinoamericanos como un todo se debe leer muchos, pero muchos libros de grandes autores, y solo se llegaria a una pequena aproximacion de la compleja y variada realidad latinoamericana. Yo he leido cerca de cuarenta libros, he viajado por mas de diez paises, he estudiado antropologia en la universidad, he vivido muchos anos en los andes y en el amazonas, y se muy poco sobre latinoamerica, (imaginense solo en la amazonia peruana hay 52 grupos etnicos), etc etc. Si leen este libro van a ver que es una copia caricaturesca de algunos libros baratos estadounidenses (baratos por su contenido) empezando por el titulo que es una serie popular de libros estadounidenses que ensenan cosas basicas como por ejemplo como usar una computadora o una licuadora."
2,El otro extremo de perfecta idiotez latinoamericana,"Como siempre nos vamos a los extremos. Unos culpan de todos nuestros males a agentes externos y ahora estos idiotas dicen que la culpa de todos nuestros males está en nosotros, ignorando y hasta aplaudiendo las intervenciones aplastantes que ha sufrido Latinoamérica por parte de agentes externos muchas veces más poderosos, inatajables y abusivos.Eso de que toda la culpa de nuestros males ""está en nosotros"" sirve para unos buenos retiros espirituales, pero no hace justicia a la verdad histórica.La verdad es que tenemos la culpa de muchos de nuestros males, pero también la historia nos muestra que hemos sido despojados y explotados mediante el uso de la fuerza bruta por agentes externos a Latinoamérica. Todos esos casos se pasan por alto en el libro para poder mantener la tesis de sus autores, por lo cual el libro no hace honor a la justicia ni a la verdad histórica."
2,Could Not Finish It,"I read ""True Grit"" with great pleasure, and after reading all of the five-star reviews of ""Masters of Atlantis"", I could not wait to get my hands on it. Well, I should have waited.The only word that comes to mind for ""Masters"" is silly. The characters are not even slightly believable, and the situations are too farcical to be good satire.The two-star rating I give it is very liberal, based on a few clever insights by the author. On the whole, however, I think a general reader would have to have an odd taste in books to find this one appealing."
2,A rather dreary book,"Unlike the two other Portis novels I've read, this one drags on with no wit or even recognizable theme. The plot involves an idiot who believes wholly in a con game sort of religion and devotes his life to promoting it.In the spirit of honesty, that's about as far as I got. He founded this religion, and then the book goes off into what amounts to office politics as the main protagonist reconfigures the religion, gains or loses control of it and that was it for me.Unlike 'Norwood' and 'True Grit' both of which I enjoyed enormously, this book just didn't work for me. I suppose had I stuck with it, perhaps, by the end, some of the wit and wisdom Portis showed in those two other books would have surfaced, but for me, life isn't forever and I was bored completely with this flat fare."
5,Dialouge and deadpan that leave your head spinning...,"I know the term 'best ever' is thrown out there too often and is in most cases downright cliche. But with this book, funniest book ever is an understatement. If you're a fan of deadpan, dry humor with witty dialouge and eccentric characters this book is for you. The first 50 pages are a bit slow in setting up the rest of the story, but from then on I was hanging on every sentence, not wanting it to end.The character of Austin Popper is one of the most eccentric, off the wall, and laugh out loud characters ever written.Let me put in the analogy of a movie. If you liked 'Royal Tennenbaums', this book is right up your alley. It has that kind of dry, acidic wit and tongue in cheek humor. If you're more of an 'American Pie' kind of person, you may be left scratching your head and wondering what the hell just happened."
1,boring,"Not what I expected. Just boring and slow. Not funny at all. Satire, well yes but boring. Gee, go to the dentist and have all your teeth removed it would be more fun than this."
4,Sometimes I can't Cope,"I am trying to broaden my musical horizons. There are a few Copeland tunes that I know and enjoy. I bot this so I could listen to more of his music and learn the names of the tunes that I didn't know. I ordered this along with four others. Unfortunately, I didn't qualify for the free shipping. Too bad, because the shipping was almost as much as the CDs. I have listened to this way more than once."
2,Know it's awful before you watch it,"That being said, this movie is hilarious. Bring in some horrible actors (let's face it, boys and girls, a minor role on Saved by the Bell was probably Patrick Muldoon's best work), a ridiculous plot (I don't care what the details are, any movie in which Taiwan plans to take over China can't be taken seriously), and a laughable script, and you just might have something worth watching... once... okay, maybe twice. This movie joins the ranks of the Scorpion King, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, and the entire genre of soft-core porn as things to be watched only for their mind-boggling (and truly entertaining) awfulness. You've been warned."
1,Piece of Junk,"My son bought this toy with his own money, and it is junk. It only drives in reverse and steers in only 1 direction. This is a terrible product. He's so disappointed that he spent his own money of this useless toy."
4,Solid workout,"... This is an intermediate level strength workout that anyone who has done any weight work will catch on to immediately. The moves are straightforward and well cued, and the mix of leg, arm, and ab work keeps the pace moving along. Intensity can be controlled by adding/reducing the weights you use. Equipment-wise, you need a step, weights, a towel or workout mat, and a broom handle.."
3,not my favorite firm video,"I do cherish my first 5 firm videos as classics (although I don't do them anymore because I no longer have a vhs machine), this one was exciting to me because it sounded like a classic but was available on dvd. However it just didn't do a ton for me. I find the newer workouts by the firm as well as instructors like Jessica Smith to be much better at sculpting strong lean bodies vs. bigger/bulkier muscles. I do like that the instructor is calm and there aren't fast switches. I still do it on occasion if I want a more slow paced workout."
5,My Favorite Workout video,"I've had this video for 10 years and still go back to it after trying many others. The length is great - 45 min - and you work everything. I do it 3 times a week and after 3 weeks of using it again, my clothes fit better and my legs are strong. I use the step box that came with my other firm videos and 3, 5 and 8 lb weights to start. You can keep increasing the weights when it gets too easy - I've worked up to 15 lbs in the past. I alternate this withThe Method Pilates - Target Specificsso I end up flexible AND strong."
5,One of my favorites,"I have had the VHS tape for over a decade and recently purchased the DVD when the tape wore out. It is one of the best strength workouts I have, and like most Firm videos, delivers a solid overall workout with some aerobics, step, jumps, and kicks to accommpany the weights. The only negative is that I dislike not being able to skip the advertisements on DVD as I did on VHS tape."
2,A Risky Purchase,"Used this fan for about 2 months. Quiet and powerful. Nice looking, also. Holmes is usually fairly reliable but this fan started cutting out and would stop running while rotating - sometimes start back up and then back off again. I tore it apart looking for a possible short in the wiring, but nothing obvious. It is now in the trash. I give it two stars only because it did run nicely for a short time."
4,nice fan,"I was very pleased with this fan. The only thing wrong, it was alittle loud, because of all the metal."
4,A Powerful Small Fan.,"This fan is rather small, but it is incredibly powerful for its size. As others have stated, it does emit a rather noticeable ""whoosh"" sound even on its lowest setting, but it's not loud enough that I can't sleep with the fan in the room. It seems to be made of durable metal construction, but I haven't had it long enough to determine that for sure.If your looking for a stylish powerful small fan and don't mind the ""whoosh"", then I'd recommend this fan. The Shipping was incredibly quick as well. I definitely would buy another one in the future."
3,Editing lets it down.,This was a good event but the editing lets it down completely. That's why I'm only giving it three stars. Save your money for something else.
2,Sucked,If Austin woulden't have wrestled this video would only get one star. Don't waste your time and money with this video. The matchs are edited. And worst yet instead of JR Kevin Kelly is an anouncer. If JR coulden't be an anouncer at least let the King Be #2.
2,It was terrible,"The whole thing sucked, and IT WAS EDITED! Now that dork above gave it 5 stars, no way, that just freaks me out!"
3,Mayhem - Maybe,"Better than some of the American offerings, which really are so edited and glitz-packaged that they should be burnt as offerings. I can have alot more fun with my $20 than those ""best of"" tapes. This was fun because you see how the promotion acts different overseas, and the fans too. Hunter is really arrogant, the Kane match was disappointing, and LOD has been better. Overall not bad."
3,A pretty average event.,"I was actualy at this event, there was 2 matches that realy sucked, Undertaker vs Kane & Jeff Jarrett vs Barakas all of the other matches were pretty average exept for HHH vs Austin which was a great match (i was standing on my seat and cheering for HHH) all in all is was not bad but was not good either."
1,Sucked,This Movie Was terrible i hated the whole thing the fans were good but the Matches are Like Monkey Crap!! Smell What the Rock Is cookin?-the Rock (joe)
1,not worth a penny,"yes it's true the fans are pumped up, but the tape quality is terrible. The fan reaction to Austin coming out is the best part. Nothing worth money"
3,"Mediocre, the edits were unnecessary.","I went out on a limb and picked this one up. It wasn't horrible, but the matches were edited. They cut from the middle to later in the match. Also, the video is a little dark, but the crowd is hot. Kevin Kelley and Michael Cole do announcing. Austin vs. HHH, Undertaker vs. Kane, Jeff Jarrett vs. Brakus, Owen Hart and Shamrock vs. Rocky and D-Lo, lots more. It has lots of matches, though."
3,The WWF Invades England!,"Ladies And Gentlemen... Boys And Girls... Children Of All Ages... Degeneration-X... Proudly Brings To You... It's WWF... Tag Team Champions Of The WORLD! The Road Dogg Jesse James... The Bad A-- Billy Gunn... The New Age Outlaws!Mayhem in Manchester is a decent wrestling video. The highlights of this overseas WWF show were the New Age Outlaws defeating LOD 2000 in a successfull tag team title defense and the heavyweight championship match featuring Stone Cold Steve Austin and HHH. Other WWF stars making appearances at this event were Kane, Undertaker, The Rock, Ken Shamrock and Sable. Overall, Mayhem in Manchester is enjoyable to watch. The only downfalls to this video were that the early matches had much of the action edited out and the sound quality is fairly poor."
1,Copyright 1984--Stop the Printing!,"Illegible maps, prolix, and outdated, outdated, outdated. It must be revised or, better yet, put out to pasture. A waste of $$$$. Go to the state parks and ask the rangers for maps. On the plus side, it recycles nicely."
5,PRESIDENTS R US,"If ever a book was designed for opening the eyes of Jr. High students, as well as adults looking for a bit of a ""refresher course,"" this is it. It presents our presidents in a quick, concise manner, that makes one want to delve further into their lives and times. Without being ponderous, and/or preachy, it is informative, while also being one heck of a pageturner. Get it. Read it. Share it.Tony Horowitz[...]"
5,Beautifully illustrated,This book is beautifully done. Full of helpful information. I purchased this book for my dad and he love it. I recommend this book to anyone who like national geographics. Pages of beautiful and realistic pictures.
2,Hit and Miss Messiah,"I agree with the first reviewer on almost every count - I liked the tenor's way of really speaking the text and the choir seemedalert to the Conductor's demands. I wasn't very happy with the baritone (not much soul) and although I don't know much about countertenors, I don't think that this one has a very attractive voice."
2,Not quite the Messiah,"Well...this was a bit disappointing. Ivars Taurins is one of my favorite Canadian choral directors and his choir responds accurately, if not a bit lightly. The Soprano is fine and the Baritone would be if the microphone were not so close to his face. The Tenor, I thought, was very exciting. The Countertenor was not good - hooty in that way countertenors can be - and he seemed to have no connection to the text at all. If Taurins must use a Countertenor, why not Chance, Daniels, Scholl or Taylor ? Anyway, this one went back to the CD store..."
2,Not the same as the original,"I purchased these several years ago to expand the number of place settings I owned. They were not the same as the original set I purchased. The set had a different back stamp, I believe 'China' and did not match. If I would have known they didn't match my existing set I would not have purchased and would have gone to 'replacements' even if it cost more."
4,Functional,"This item works great, but it is not a pair, just one. Order 2 for one mask since there are 2 ports."
2,Questionable Attachment,"Well, unless I'm missing something (and I don't think I am) I can't get this adapter to stay on the filter cartridge (that it is intended for). I have solved the problem by having to resort to taping it on, around the edge of the adapter to the filter cartridge. Otherwise, at the slightest accidental brushing of the (pink) 2091 filter edge, the adapter with this filter, fall off. Any simillar experiences? Any suggestions?"
3,"Good product, bad company.","Product was supposed to arrive for Christmas - paid A LOT extra to have it done...it did not arrive and nearly ruined a family member's Christmas. Had to purchase another guitar for him to open on Christmas day...the Austin guitar showed up 3 days after Christmas but we decided to keep it and take the other back b/c it was a better product. I would buy the Austin Bazaar brand again, but not from this company."
1,Buyer Beware!,The guitar claimed to have all you could ask for for fifty dollars and more. But the guitar i received was missing accessories and the paint was chipped.
5,Sport Spectator Soccer,"When my sons were playing high school sports, I often wished the sports dept. would conduct seminars to teach me the fine points-(even the gross points!)--of the games. Now, years later, along comes Bryan Jones and his SportSpectator pamphlets-""Cliff Notes"" for the sports fan!I found the SportSpecatator brochures to be clearly written, comprehensive, and ""user-friendly"" in format and style. I especially appreciated the simple diagram of the field and the glossary of soccer terms because they provide a quick, simple, and portable reference.The SportSpecatator brochure is a great tool that enhances the enjoyment of the game for both the first-time spectator and for a veteran fan who wants to share the game with newcomer.Great idea, well-executed!"
2,"Vegan-friendly, but not terribly fun","This is a cute novelty toy, but I can't say my son got much use out of it. It was a first birthday present, and he probably rode it a handful of times. And he didn't ask about it when we passed it along to someone else."
3,.,It does not teach FPA i.e. you should have attended training on FPA (or read the manual multiple times) before you can use this CD. It is a preparation for the CFPS exam.There are 200 questions in the CD divided into various sections. There are few repetitions i.e. the same question appears in the same section more than once. The CD is fine but there are some typos/errors.Overall not a very good buy. Atleast not upto my expectation that was set after seeing the IFPUG FPA papers published by Longstreet Consulting.However the test taking tips are good.
1,Bag seams fail,"A previous shipment of Tazo Iced Black Tea bags worked quite well. This shipment arrived with loose tea scattered over the inside of the box. 10 of the 24 bags had seams that had separated; so far another 2 have separated seams.Tazo Iced Black Tea Filterbags, 1-1/4-Ounce Filterbags (24-Count Total)"
5,Baby Snuggy,This item was an excellent purchase as Stieff plush are collector's items. Besides that---he is adorable!
2,Disappointed,There wasn't much to this book (only about 30 English words long). It did not engage my child at all. Lots of better books to choose from including any from the English and Spanish Foundation Series by me+mi publishing.
3,Nice and comfortable but tears over time.,"Very nice and comfortable seat for my 2 year old but I am now purchasing my third one because, over time, it tends to tear. She eventually tore the side of it off after it cracked. However, I am purchasing this again because it is by far the most comfortable for my children. My 5 year old also uses this and she loves it."
2,not quite,well i ordered my guitar the delivery date and time was fine but when i got it it had a huge whole busted in the side of it im thinking ups?... but they need to upgrade their shipping company b/c that made me very upset to spend money and find the item(s) in bad condition and the tuner peg had somethng going wrong with it but once you fix it it's a good product! but delivery gets 2 stars at least they didnt deliver to the wrong house lol
5,GREAT,Love Mariah's club mixes and nowadays it's getting harder and harder to find CD versions of her singles. So glad Amazon still carries some. Mariah's voice still shows she's the star of the club! And congrats to her and her babies!
4,THIS IS THE BEST GAME,this game is so much fun all the shots are cool and you can do COOL dunks in this game you can make your own player (i make mine the best) and you can MAKE YOUR OWN SLAMDUNK COOOOOL i gave this game 4 stars cause it has a little bad grafics and is sort of hard but the two player game is SOOOOO COOL BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL LOVE IT
1,a bad game,First of all this game stinks.The graphics are horrible.The gameplay is bad and the game is not realalistic.The players look [bad[.Worst of all the players are really slow and dunk 99.9% of the time.Do not buy this game.In fact don't buy anything made buy 989 sports cause they never have good grapics.If u got a PS2 then buy nba live 2003 its much better than this game!
1,Don't even Rent this game,"This is a worst basketball game I ve ever played. Poor graphic, poor movement and poor functionality. This game doesn't have variety of movement, and is too slow. For example, it will make you easily dunk after you miss your free throw. I slam it almost 80 to 90 percent of when I missed my free throw. After I played PS2 NBA Street I just felt that this game is even worse. If you have a PS2, I recommend you to have NBA Street."
3,IT'S OK,THIS IS AN OK PRODUCT. IT IS A LITTLE HEAVY AND SLOW TO RECHARGE. I USE IT TO POWER AN (NRG Varalux On-Camera Video Light with Cigarette Lighter Connector.) IT LASTS ABOUT 40 MIN ON THE LIGHT. THIS IS A FAIR PRODUCTCON: IT TAKES ABOUT 16 HOURS TO RECHARGE. THE MANUAL SUGGEST THAT YOU LET THE BATTERY GET VERY LOW BEFORE YOU RECHARGE IT. ALSO YOU SHOULDN'T LEAVE IT ON THE CHARGE PAST 16 HOURS.IF YOU CAN FIND SOMETHING BETTER BUY IT.
4,CATIA V5 Workbook,"This book has a been a great organization tool for the newer or even experienced CATIA user. The clear and consise explanation of the workbenches and their functions is a great reference tool.The lessons build on each other and break down the sold modeling process into small easily understood pieces. This book has answered many, "" i wonder what the thougth process was behind this function..."", questions. This book will stay within arm reach of my CAD station!"
3,A little dissapointed,"The sample chapters at the Schroff web site shows nice colorful graphics for this book. In reality, the book is a poor reproduction with only black & white graphics. As a result, some of the screen shots in the book are very hard to make out. For the price ..., I would have expected a much higher quality book. Otherwise, the content is good if you're a beginner with Catia V5."
4,"Really fresh, but water plus no bone or skin makes more like tuna.","So, these were sort of bland, but I sure can't complain about the quality. If you want your sardines firm and fresh without all the oil and without the scales and the bones, this is a great choice. I'll bet if they were mashed up and mixed with mayo and relish and served to me, I'd think I was eating tuna!"
1,excellent early material but BEWARE of what you're getting.,"this is a great album. showcases much of 242's earlier material but, i should've looked more closely at amazon's item description. apparently they're making CDR copies on-demand of 'out of print' titles. so, yes, it's a CDR (for 12 dollars). doesn't come with the original artwork, only a bad, digital print of the original artwork and a terribly abbreviated version of it at that.i was hoping to replace my cassette copy of this release with the a factory manufactured CD but am extremely disappointed with the CDR copy i received. i could've illegally downloaded the tracks and burned my own CDR if that's what i was after.AGAIN, BEWARE!"
5,Mandatory - Just Get It,"If you ""get"" Kraftwerk or Gary Numan (or even Devo), get this...it's really, really good. As far I know, they did all of these on 4-track, so the audio quality is astounding. If you understand Blade Runner, you'll love this."
3,Entertaining Space Opera,This is an enjoyable and solid space opera distinguished by gentle humor and some on target satire. Good trip reading. Well worth a few dollars in a used bookstore.
5,Excellent space opera,"This book is one of my all time favorites. Brian Daley creates a wonderfully large sci-fi world that makes you want to know more about it. The plot quickly draws you in with Daley's in depth style. While not only being enjoyable in its self, it sets up the next book in the series very well (which is also excellent). If you like Lois McMasters Bujold, you'll love this."
5,Amazed at how good it remains after 15 years!,"I first read this book when it appeared in paperback in 1985 or so. On a recenct visit to my parents home, I found it on a shelf while poking around on a lazy afternoon and started reading...I was delighted to find it was as good as I remembered, the characters are vivid, likeable and engaging and the story is epic and interesting. I have never read too much of this genre, so I'm not as picky as some others who have reviewed this title, I suppose, but I find the above qualities refreshing in a genre that seems to have been left to the ""experts"", a situation that always ends up dull. My biggest piece of advice would be to buy all three books at once, if possible, free up a weekend and go for a great ride. Even at 33 I felt-as I did at 17-a sense of personal loss when the last page of the last book ended, like friends had moved away."
3,Really Good Camera Case,"This Samsonite case was well manufactured and had a lot of storage for cards, camera, accessories, etc. Well worth it."
3,the motif is distracting,"This is a good beginner/intermediate tape and a thorough working of the lower body if you can stand looking at that phoney jungle motif.For this reason,I have only done this workout a few times and probably should donate it to the Salvation Army as it is gathering dust...."
2,swept away,the swept away movie i ordered was advertised as being dubbed w/ english but was acutally in italian w/ english subtitles? i decided it wasn't worth doing anything about but it would have been nice if they had got it right. thanks for listening
4,Italian politics wrapped in a sexy package,"I had seen this film once before years ago and took it for just gender politics. Then I wanted to write a paper on it for my undergraduate Cinema Studies class and when I started to do research, I realized this movie was an allegory for the political atmosphere of Italy in the late 60s and early 70s. Being a young American, I was not aware of the struggles and sometimes terrorism that went on there during that period. Even if you don't know about the politics you can still enjoy it if you can get over the woman being hit constantly (it really helps to read what the director said about that, the characters are representations of classes, so it is not about a man beating a woman, but the lower class rising up against their oppressors) [...] is where you can find my paper if you would like to read more on it. Otherwise, a beautiful movie with terrific actors, especially the ruggedly handsome Giancarlo Giannini with his crazed eyes and stellar performance."
2,Not a Romantic Romp,"Viewers actually listening to the Italian or really reading the English subtitles will realize that ""Swept Away"" is not a romantic tale of passion but Wertmuller's nasty political tract about class struggle. Raffaela is kicked, punched, sexually subjugated, denied food, and made to beg for love (in a reference to Mary Magdalene, she actually weeps on Giannini's feet)to play out the director's theme turning tables on the arrogant, masterful wealthy class and their Christian Democratic Party social policy. The master/servant role reversal, particularly as a prelude to ""love,"" is a bit much. Any stars are due to the remarkable actors, especially Mariangela Melato.If you love Antonioni's great, complex film L'Avventura, you'll howl at the borrowed imagery of the island sequence, complete with a little abandoned hut built into the rocks."
1,Sex and Violence,"I saw this movie in an Italian film class. My professor, like the majority of the reviewers here, sees Wertmüller's message of class distinctions in Italian society and gender relationships in civilization easily and applauds her vision. Myself and quite a few of the students in his class cannot. Speaking only for myself, I say that I cannot understand why her message must be polluted with S&M behavior and borderline sexual assault. As an artist I know that there are an infinite number of ways to communicate the differences of class, political ideologies, and sexual relationships without depending on kinky sex and violence. But I also know that censorship is a hateful thing. And so, my review serves as a sort of warning: you will see Oscar-caliber acting, direction and cinematography, but you will also see a very ugly side of humanity, one that I can't agree with."
4,Book about the Quecha people,"This is a pretty good book on the Quecha culture of Peru. However, there is not much in the book about Machu Picchu. So the title is a bit misleading. If you are looking for information about the historical and spiritual culture of Peru, this book, along with Return of the Children of Light, and Masters of the Living Energy: The Mystical world of the Q'ero of Peru, are your best bets. If you are looking for detailed information on Machu Picchu you should look at The Machu Picchu Guidebook: A Self-Guided Tour."
4,I liked it...,VERY informative and beautifully written (though I think some cultural words were misspelled).. The background of the spiritual world in the Andes is beautifully described and very informative... I was born in the Andes and have learned A LOT from reading this book.. Too bad her tours are sooo expensive! =(
4,want to visit MP more than ever after reading this,"I've always wanted to go to M.P and probably would have gone any old way. Now, I want to go on one of Carol's Magical Journeys! To me MP represented beautiful and fascinating remains of the Incan people. Now, I am also fascinated by the Quechua people who lived there prior to the Incans and to this day. It is these people that the book is really about and it reveals their belief systems, ceremonies, ways of life. Now I feel that a visit wouldn't be complete without a shamanic ceremony - a real one not the disrespectful fakes that are marketed to tourists by some non believers.Also, the book includes an interesting section about Hiram Bingham, the Yale professor credited with discovering MP. It lays out the controversy that surrounds him but also includes a letter written by one of his descendents for counterpoint. Anyone who is not only interested in MP but the indigenous residents of the surrounding areas will appreciate this book."
3,I can't believe they didn't add Owen VS Bret at Wrestlemania X!,I can't believe they didn't add it! One of Owen's best matches and greatest win in his career and they didn't add it?!?! Lame! I am still buying it just for Owen's matches!
3,hart to hart,i just wanted to say that i cannot belive that the dynamite kid vs chris benoit match from stampede in 1989 was not included.this was considered THE BEST MATCH OF ALL TIME once.thats why i dont buy more so called greatest hits wrestling dvds.
4,hart anthology,the dvd puts faces on the people who you have heard about. I didnt know the harts were such a big family. I purchased the book last year and only have made it half way thru. The dvd is a watered down version of the book. after watching I hope to learn more details from the book. The movie will keep me in pace with the events better than speed reading backwards. I did like the dvd and thought it was very well done. The dvd doesnt get into all that bret has had to go thru to get to where he got to today. I'm not really trying to push the book but between it and the dvd I feel I have come to know the harts and their tragedies. Real sad what life dishes out especially from vince.
2,Much more could have been said,"First, this book isn't very organized. Next, I am someone who has a great interest in religion, politics and conflict resolution; yet, this book proved to be a big disappointment. The author spent alot of time talking about irrelevant matters. I was hoping for a summary or introduction even to what the title states (Biblical Justice) but that wasn't delivered. The Bible seemed to be mentioned by the author reluctantly and we are given miniscule bits of information on biblical justice. I'd say a couple of sentences at most in this entire book. What was the author talking about the rest of the time? I don't know either. Not only is the title deceiving, but it's as if the author was at a loss for words or even lacked knowledge on the subject. I don't recommend this book."
5,Great book for anyone who has felt conflict about belonging.,"I am a displaced Sonoran Desert Dweller (from Tucson) and all I have to do is read Animal Dreams and I am back home in an environment and culture that is familiar and soothing. Barbara's descriptions of other areas of Arizona, Canyon de Chelly and the ancient Indian dwellings in the White Mountains, are as if you are standing there.The characters are with depth and if you went to Arizona to those places during those times, that is what you would find. Strong women like Emelina, keeping their culture alive, and a big-city community barely aware of the on-goings in Nicaragua. It also describes the not uncommon will to survive of mining towns that no longer have the mine. (I'll wager that Grace is representative of the towns Clifton and Morenci.)Animal Dreams is always a homecoming."
2,Too flawed to recommend--an immature novel which shows the author's promise,"Animal Dreams is the early work of a talented author. Kingsolver knows her way around a phrase, and foreshadows the talents she later put to much better use. But, in Animal Dreams, she lapses into a overly sentimental view of the world. Good and evil are cut from fairly obvious cloth. Women and men fall slightly into this pattern: women have more depth and compassion while the men are emotionally limited people. What I enjoyed most of all were the forays into the non-rational mind of Homer: to me these were the work of a true writer, whose talents had yet to manifest in full. I haven't read Kingsolver's other novels yet, but I will likely do so, thanks to the promise she showed in this mediocre novel."
2,Finishing it was a struggle,"I had high hopes for this book after enjoying ""The Poisonwood Bible"" and ""The Bean Trees"", but unfortunately this book seemed to encapsulate the weaknesses of both those books and none of their strengths.I found the majority of the characters annoying and unlikable, particularly the main character, just as I did in ""The Bean Trees"". The ending was too pat and simplistic, as in ""The Bean Trees"", and it needed some severe editing, as did ""The Poisonwood Bible"".I can't emphasize enough how much I disliked the main character of this book. That, combined with the unrealistic plot, made this book a struggle for me to get through. I was counting the pages, as I did in the last third or so of the vastly superior ""The Poisonwood Bible.""Maybe Kingsolver's writing skills (and decisions about major characters' personalities) will improve with more time. I know she has the potential, so I remain hopeful."
1,HELP HELP HELP,"This book was the worst piece of literature I've ever read. If it was my own property and I wouldn't have to read it for my English class, it would have entertained my garbage can instead. The author seems to have serious trouble with the world around her and a notorious passion for the overuse of metaphores. Two times I actually fell asleep while reading this book. Her characters lack personality, the whole plot seems unrealistic, but as if it tries to convince you of its reality. Especially the main character Cosima, who wants to look like a outsider but then complains about it all the time, is missing a realistic personality. If you are worried about nature, DON'T WASTE PAPER LIKE THIS."
1,What Happened?,"There is no doubt that Barbara Kingsolver is a talented writer, which i learned from reading another one of her novels, The Bean Trees. But Kingslover disappointed me with this book. After reading her other book, i expected this story to be another descriptive realistic book. What I got was the sappy story of Codi Noline's romance with an old high-school boyfriend, and the story of how she ""finds her past"" in the town where she grew up. The plot was not at all creative, and like every other romance novel. I would not even call this book ""literature."" If you want to read a good book, i would suggest The Bean Trees, also by Barbara Kingsolver."
4,"well-written, but not my type of book","I read this book for my school's Literary Club, and I thought it was pretty good. I liked the way it was written, and it was easy to read, but it was lacking in the plot department. I didn't really like that it didn't really focus on anything. It was just about this chick and her life and her search to find herself. I, unlike most girls, aren't into ""chick"" books, and I thought this was kind of like that. Overall, I'd say take it or leave it. It's well-written with almost no plot. You decide."
2,The Great White Savior,"I decided to give Kingslover another chance after reading The Bean Trees. Unfortunately, Animal Dreams didn't improve my opinion of the author's storytelling. Like the Bean Trees, Animal Dreams seems to be obsessed with the Great White Mother rescuing the poor little red and brown folks out there. It's great that she has a liberal heart and think about political issues that deal with non-whites out there. However, it doesn't translate so nobly anymore. It's starting to sound like Upper Middle Class white Peace Corps volunteer club. Let's have more stories about people helping themselves, rather than a bunch of Halle's rescuing the ""natives"" from powers-that-be. Also, the theme of finding the perfect ""minority"" mate in both books are getting old. Please think of a new story."
4,Haunting,"I found this book emotionally haunting, filled with the main character's yearning for what might have been. Kingsolver does a brilliant job of conveying the love, regrets, dreams, and hopes of the characters, and of tying this to political struggles of the oppressed."
4,Beautifully Written,"I found this book to be insightful, mystical and multi-layered. I enjoyed reading it and looked forward to the next secret to be uncovered."
1,OUCH!,"I was forced to read this book for a college english class I took. It was pure torture. Kingsolver describes everything in such a tedious fashion, it makes you want to find the nearest blunt object and bludgeon yourself to death with it. If you are on your own free will, do not buy this book. If you do...may god have mercy on your soul."
1,Did nothing for me-- this isn't important literature.,"I know many people who LOVE Kingsolver, so I decided to take a chance. I hated Animal Dreams, but I thought it would be unfair to judge the author on the basis of one novel, so I read Bean Trees too. My opinion didn't change. I usually read classics or avant-garde literature, and Kingsolver just pales in comparison. She writes faux-important stories for people who want to feel like they've done something magnificent just by reading. Expect a lot more white people trying to take Polaroids at pow-wows thanks to Kingsolver."
1,BORING,"I had to read this book for my 10th grade English class. I'm sure you all know how there are chick flicks(movies directed towards women). Well this is a chick book. There was virtually no plot, I felt like I was reading mindless babble for at least 3/4 of it and by the end was glad it was over. The bottom line is : it's not worth it."
1,"Pretentious, middle-brow, melodrama","Of all the literature I have ever read in my life, nothing has ever inflicted more pain. I was constantly overwhelmed by an urge to impale the book against the nearest object that would suffice for the task. At one point, my desperation became so acute that I actually attempted to eat the text in an attempt to end the suffering. The book is nothing more than trite melodrama. Its theme -going back to your roots, rediscovering your identity and finding your true place within the world- is likewise trite, as well as pretentious. Kinksolver seems to have an obsessive compulsive tendency towards excessive metaphor usage. Belongs in the nearest trash heap along with all the other mediocre literature ever written."
1,not worth your time,"Unsophisticated, trite, and maudlin. Not a real romance and not a real enlighening read. The story line"
4,Ms. Kingsolver never disappoints...,"While this novel did not resonate with me quite as much as The Poisonwood Bible did, the prose was beautiful, and I definitely identified with Codi, the main character. This story was strikingly human and the ending literally brought tears to my eyes--I would certainly recommend it to any and everyone!"
5,A Truly Remarkable Book!,I was given this book by a friend at work and she insisted that I read it. Once I started the book I just couldn't put it down. I found Codi's story to be compelling and as the layers unfolded I couldn't help but cry as I realized what this girl must have went through. This book shows the steps Codi goes through to realize that she has been loved all along and it just took opening herself up to figure that out. This was one of the best books I have read in awhile and I highly recommend it and I cant wait to read more books by this author!
4,Not a home run but some beautiful moments,"Kingsolver has a knack for taking the ordinary lives of ordinary people and making them come alive. Although I didn't find this novel to have quite the character development or the plotline of The Poisonwood Bible, it's a great story about trying to find the road home. I found the storyline to be extremely realistic and all the more absorbing therefore. This is a novel about sibling connections, the wisdom of the town matriarchs, the struggle of land use in the West, the heritage of Native Americans, and the search for self-esteem in the least likely place. There are some great character sketches in here that anyone from a small town will instantly be able to identify. This is a good introduction to Kingsolver's work."
4,grows on you,"As I began this book I was a little restless as I was not really ""into"" the central character, Cosima. The more I read, the better it got. Kingsolver has a beautiful way of bringing about change. In this case the change is a 180 for Cosima. By the time I finished reading I was ready for it to go on and on."
1,BEWARE!!!,"I read this book under duress during the summer and I must warn all of you prospective buyers - DON'T DO IT!!! Please, save your money for a book with a plot! I have read some other reviews of this book - they say it is full of beauty and character. The only thing this book is full of is meaningless prattle. But, for all of you who have always wondered what the plants in your garden are thinking . . go right ahead!!!"
1,A Harlequin Romance,"If you are the kind of person that likes Harlequin Romance novels, then Barbara Kingsolver is the author for you to check out. If you find people sleeping with Navajos exotic, then this novel is for you. Can you hardly wait for the following: Over the top symbolism? Cramming vague morals down your throat to leave you confused? Character that you can't stand? Wantingso badly for the perspective character in the novel to die that it consumes you? If you answered yes to any of the following then Barbara Kingsolver is the author for you."
1,Terrible Book,"This is, unequivocally, one of the most boring books I've ever read. Makes Hemmingway look exciting..."
1,This publication should not exist.,"WORST BOOK EVER! Kingslover destroyes and dismisses all of the characteristics that create a decent novel. This book is devoid of any plot or driving force for the main character to face. Kingslover has the uncanny ability to spend hundreds of pages, for a main character to dream and wish of a past that she clearly never had and cannot reclaim. As pointed out by a friend of mine during Senior English (the year myself and others were forced to read this atrocity), all of the lessons that one could possible come away with from this book are present in the Disney film, The Lion King. ""Remember who you are"", and remaining true to your past, all of which are present in a kid's movie. I would reccomend this book for anyone who enjoys, reading about horny Native Americans, and 300 pages of liberal dribble so humanity shan't forget the electrical engineer who died in Latin America. To quote Comic Book Guy ""WORST BOOK EVER!"""
3,If it had been written by anyone else.....,"I probably would not have finished it. Poisonwood Bible is my first exposure to this author, and I thought it was one of the best books I'd ever read. But...I had a hard time getting into this one. In the beginning the book jumps back and forth between past and present, as well as from different points of view. This worked very well in Poisonwood Bible, but was harder to follow in Animal Dreams.Second, the protagonist--Codi Noline, is really not all that likable at the beginning of the story. It's only when you get about half way through the book, if you've managed to hang in there that long, that you learn why she's the way she is and hope for her to change. Ultimately, the growth of this character and others made the novel enjoyable for me in the end. The second half was much better and more emotionally fulfilling. I'm glad I stuck with it."
2,Overrated,"I was quite disappointed that a book that was marketed as literature could be filled with so much garbage. I found the main character's discovery of the native Americans to be not much more than the ""noble savage"" mistake. Especially nauseating was her reference to the ""bread that smelled like love."" Although I agree with the author's point of view about Central America and about the environment, I found her so preachy that I wanted only to disagree with her!! One bright spot is the inclusion of sections written in the father's point of view. These parts were ethereal, poignant and not sappy at all. I'd only recommend this book to someone who likes romance novels but is embarrassed to carry around those garrish softcovers"
2,Mostly Later Recordings By A Partying Jerry Lee Lewis,The recordings are from the middle-age Jerry Lee Lewis when partied so much that his voice and caring and memory just did not go into music any more. I listened to many of his orginal recording sessions when we ran around LA together-none of those great quality sessions are on this cd.
4,One BIG Question . . .,"Does anyone know if the songs on this CD set are the original recordings, or re-recordings? Since it doesn't answer that question anyplace, including the little booklet that comes with it, I would grade it as such:5-stars - if they are the original recordings3-stars - if some or all are re-recordings.So, I'll hedge my rating by placing it half way between at 4-stars."
4,DaVinci sleigh toddler bed,Bed was relatively easy to put together and seems solidly built. Of course only time willtell if it will withstand the beating it will take. On initial appearances it appears a goodbargain for the money.
4,Very nice toddler bed,This is a very nice and sturdy little bed it was worth every penny. Easy to install it only took 20 mins.
5,Durable and attractive,"Our two-year-old daughter loves her new little bed. The bed seems sturdy and the Cherry color is an attractive finish. I would be hesitant to have any child over 50 pounds lay on it, but it is not meant for that. Assembly was a little tricky because all of the slats have to line up just right before tightening."
5,We love this bed!,We bought this bed for my 25 month old son as he was climbing out of the crib every night. It was easy to put together. My son absolutely loves it. It is great quality and a great price. We couldn't be happier with this bed. it is definitely a great option for toddlers who are too active for their crib yet too small for a regular bed!
2,It is garbage,This bed is wabbling and one of the screws that holds the side rail on came out. The hole seems to be to big for it. The top crossbar on the headboard spins as well. It is garbage. I would not recommend.
3,Disappointed,"I ordered this bed based on the exceptional reviews on amazon. but i was disappointed. the bed looked nice, but the slats were thin and fragile. it only one bigger piece in the middle; unlike my other toddler's bed, which has 3 stronger pieces. if your kids are small and light, the bed would be ok. unfortunately, it looks too fragile, and the support would bend significantly when sitting at either ends. i don't want a good support for the mattress; and this definitely goes back to amazon... (but how do i ship it back when the box was opened... um...)"
4,Very good bed,"This bed is well made, was easy to put together and our son loves it. No problems whatsoever."
5,Great bed,"After reading a lot of reviews I was convinced that DaVinci was the best toddler bed you could get a reasonable price. So far we are very pleased. The bed was easy to put together, is very sturdy, and looks very nice...not cheap like many you see displayed at stores. And my little boy (2 years) loves it as well. We are very happy with our purchase and feel that we got a great deal on Amazon."
4,Great!,I have had this for about 5 months now and so far it has held up well. I would have made it 5 stars but it was scratched (small) in a few places from shipping. I didn't think it was worth the shipping to send it back and get a placement. My son loves his big boy bed. Only fell out a few times at night for about a week and then he had it figured out. I recommend!
4,good quality for price,"This bed is a good quality for the price. It was easy to assemble and I did it myself in under 30 minutes. The only negative I have is that the screws show in the front of the bed. It would be better if they had white caps to go over. Also, I wish the side railings were a little bit longer. It also came with a dent on the headboard."
4,Rated only to 50 lbs. Good looking bed,"Bed was somewhat easy to assemble. It took about 1 hour by myself. The slats were the most difficult to assemble, would be much easier if you had 2 to align them. Bed looks great.I don't like that the bed is rated to only 50 lbs. That part was disappointing since I want to be able to sit on it with my child. My husband (165 lbs) did lay on it before I could tell him not to and it didn't break, so I guess that is good but since it is rated only to 50 lbs, he won't be doing that again!The standard crib mattress that I purchased fit perfectly. The flat sheet and comforter are hard to tuck in since you have the rails. My 20 month old can easily climb on the mattress by himself. He hasn't fallen out of it because I haven't had him try to sleep in it yet, still getting his big boy room ready."
3,Protection guard too small,The bed is beautiful but the protection guard is too short and I found my toddler sleeping in the floor two times. We solved the problem by putting another removable guard and closing the side completely. It does not look as good and she needs to jump them to get to bed now but at least I don't have to worry about her falling off the bed.
4,Looks good,"This toddler bed looks nice and seems to be working. It was an adjustment going from crib to the bed, but that would be the case for any toddler bed. Light weight, but I feel comfortable draping my upper body across it to give my toddler a snuggle before bed. Color is accurate to picture shown."
4,Great toddler bed,"This little bed is great! my son is 16 mo. and was so exited to see his bed up. Bed is really sturdy, and good looking I love it!would definitly recommend."
3,Black Virgin,"I purchased this disc for the recording of the Litanies a la Vierge Noir, thinking it would be as written for SSA and organ. Much to my surprise the organ part had been orchestrated, without any liner notes as to when, why, or by whom. I was a little disappointed, both in terms of the arrangement and by the lack of relevant information."
4,a great party book,"the short test in the book kept us in hysterics. this a great way to get a large group arguing. All in all, the book is illuminating and fun. We almost all loved it."
3,I bet the author cheated....,"This book was a very fun book for a person who is very social or goes to alot of bars, but if you are a ""lone wolf"" this book will only entertain you only so much.It is a fun book, but you might sell it to Half-Price books when you are done with it.P.S. I'm a cottontail rabbit. :>"
2,Sound Clarity was a Disappointement,"I purchased this music cd to use as a background for my balloon twisting art. I won't be doing this. The Calliope sound was clear and great, but the quality of the bass instrument (Tuba?) was fuzzy sounding, not clear. It was annoying to me. Not being a musician, I don't know how to best describe it, but it was not good. There was a great selection of Carousel Music on this CD.Good Old USA Carousel Music Vol. 1"
5,I cheese sandwich this movie!,This movie is absolutely fantastic. It epitomizes the ironies and comical ways of common relationships. I love it!
3,"Cute movie, not the best, but this is our first Jon Favreau experience","My husband and I happened upon this movie one day on TV and enjoyed it - we loved the character Jon Favreau played (surely I misspelled that!) and kind of fell in love with his work at that time!! Since then, we've been big fans and can usually recognize his weird sense of humor (he did ELF, etc).We still own this DVD and although it has been on a shelf for a few years, unwatched, I still keep it as one I may pull out from time to time as you never find it on TV. I just love his character - and there are some lines from the movie my husband and I still quote. Yes, it's a love story but not overly gushy and funny enough so my husband enjoyed it, too (he typically stays VERY clear of ""girl movies"")"
4,The Reality of Love and Sex,"Valerie Breiman,directs her real life love story with passion and smooth direction. The story is told from the woman's viewpoint-Jamke Jaansen is a beautiful young woman going from one relationship to another until she meets ""Mr. Right"". This relationship with Jon Favreau, is a lust at first sight scenario that develops into love and a live-in relationship. What happens after two years and the newness and the lust wears off? They split- why work on something that has become a bore?The couple spend the rest of the movie moving from one person to another trying to find the missing piece that will make them whole. The interesting sidelight is that it is the woman who has had 13 sexual experiences while the man only 2- he attempts to make up for lost time. During the maturing process of their lives and loves they discover that what they really want and need is each other. Luckily each discovers this signficanceat almost the same moment-movie meant for a rainy afternoon."
4,ENTERTAINING LOOK AT RELATIONSHIPS,"You wouldn't think so, but Jon Favreau and Famke Janssen have a great deal of on-screen chemistry. I also would not guess that Janssen had the comedic abilities that she displays in this film. The film chronicles a relationship between Favreau and Janssen in its various stages from meeting to the first parts of the relationship to the tough times the break-up, the post break-up trying to make each other jealous, and if I am not mistaken, they do reconcile in the end? It has been about a year since I saw this film, so forgive me if I am wrong. I do know they at least end up as friends. While the concept of the film is nothing new, there is something fresh and charming about the way their relationship develops and how the characters perceive their lives and themselves within and outside of their relationship. Both characters are endearing in their own ways, and you genuinely feel what each is going through. (Also this film boasts a good soundtrack)."
3,love can be hard,"Famke Janssen(The X-Men Movies, GoldenEye) and Jon Favreau(Made,Swingers) are perfect as the couple who get together then break up and then get back together again. The 2 when breaking up seem to be following each other and they have annoying opposites. Janssen gets involved with Noah Emmerich(The Truman Show, Windtalkers) who is really married. It's like this and Favreau keeps on bugging her. It's a good story with good actors. Highlight would be when David Schwimmer(Tv's just recently canceled Friends and Kissing The Fool)visits Favreau as a Johova's Witness"
3,Sex is wrong,"I watched this movie on the false assumption that both Famke Janssen and Alan Cumming were in it. Oh well.It was nice to see her as the lead, as well as Jon, who gives a very funny Vince Vaughn type performance, similar to the comedy seen today, the Seth Rogan style of incessant, well delivered innuendo. Janssen is good also. She's beautiful, but a bit more out of place with the racy material.It's not entirely explained how she went from the cute girl we see in the beginning to the slut she becomes, and the same is true of Jon becoming a slut after being in a relationship with her. This movie seems to support my sinking suspicion that most couples are in a relationship for no reason (and speak of the devil, the imdb says this film is autobiographical.) The film has both elements of its title, but not much else, which is dissapointing.This is a 2000 film. I've been watching more movies from this era, it's interesting to revisit."
4,Great Movie!,"Considering the movie's somewhat low profile, this came as a pleasant surprise to me. In this romantic comedy, both Famke Janssen and Jon Favreau absolutely shine. their on-screen chemistry is superb, and seems amazingly natural. Favourite scenes of mine, include the first date (where Jon comments on Famke's history of men with the line ""you're...like a whore!""), the farting in bed scene (- hilarious, and Famke's reaction to Jon looks so natural it's hard to believe she was acting!), and an excellent cameo from David Schwimmer towards the end of the film. Also worth pointing out is the Robert De Niro wannabe, who just loves to impersonate his favourite actor. I haven't seem many films starring either of the two leads featured here, but both Jon and Famke give top-notch performances. My only criticism of the film - and this is nit-picking really - is that it's too short. Otherwise, hugely enjoyable film."
4,Swingers all grown up,"This movie was absolutely hysterical. Plenty of dry wit and humorous dialogue, it is easily one of the best romantic comedies of 2000. If you liked Swingers, you will love this!"
1,When Prick Met Loser,"Absolutely beyond belief that this theatrical travesty is so highly regarded. The ""heroine"" is utterly clueless about how and when she is being treated badly and her boyfriend (for most of the movie) is a smug, misogynistic prick who (to borrow is a famous quote) ""is a self-made man and worships his creator."" His a-holish entrance put me off immediately, his treatment of the heroine is shabby almost throughout and the fact that she actually allows him back into her life merely shows what a horrendous opinion she has of herself.I would not want to know either of these people and was glad of only two things: One, I was only subjected to 80 minutes of them. Two, I recorded it on my DVR and didn't part with anything besides my time."
3,INSPIRING SENTENCES FOR MEDITATION,Inspiring sentences to be read before meditation or before starting the day for a better God-awareness
5,Every American citizen needs to read this book,"Excellent book. Easy-to-read, personal, accounts of real people being held in the INS ""prison"" system, the effects of 9/11 on the system, and the problems with trying to reform the system through the court system. Accounts of abuse within the system, indefinite holding of individuals on minor infractions of the law. Inside views of multiple INS and other holding facilities. The detention system for those with few rights is a serious problem and it's making me wonder if I should consider immigration law (I'm in law school). I wish everyone was aware of the system we have for dealing with immigrants. This book is a great place to start."
3,"Great for collectors or fans of the weird, otherwise...","If you're just a casual neil young fan, get out while you still can, because this isn't even vaguely what you expect. If you're a big neil fan, however, this is definately worth owning, if nothing else just so you can try to puzzle out what the hell he was thinking. If you keep an open mind to all the synths, you'll find some good songwriting here, and you'll hear some cool things sonicly that were quite ahead of their time. Unfortunately, almost all of the songs are flawed in some manner. It seems to me that this album was perhaps too far ahead of its time to be executed properly. The biggest flaw is neil's vocoder laced vocals, often rendering him totally unrecognizable. Sometimes this is cool (sample and hold, first verse of computer age) but other times its just distracting (second verse of computer age, transformer man). Anyway, if your a fan of neil and your open to experimentation, then I say try it, just don't expect a masterpiece."
4,The Godfather of Electronica,"Departing from the straightforward hard rock sound of albums like ""Rust Never Sleeps"" and ""Zuma"", this is the album on which Neil Young invented the synthesizer-based style of music which would come to be known as ""techno"" or ""electronica"". Drawing inspiration from his interest in model train technology, Neil crafted an album almost entirely comprised of synthesizers, drum machines and electronic sounds. Although he comes off sounding like C3PO on songs like ""Transformer Man"" and ""Sample and Hold"", it all works, and marvelously so. Bands like Nine Inch Nails, 808 State, The Orb, Erasure, Nitzer Ebb, and the Pet Shop Boys would owe a substantial debt to Mr. Young and his futuristic soundscapes."
3,"This is not his best, but it isnt bad","Neil fans could be shocked by his departure from 60s and 70s classics. All in all, its a weak album by Niels standards, and mediocre in general. But I happen to like it. Being a Niel fan, and enjoying the 80s sound and heavy use of a vocoder, this is OK.Not as bad as 'Landing on Water'Not a good place for a first Niel album. But collectors may still enjoy this one.Transformer man is a good track."
2,What was he thinking?,"The computer voice is interesting for a song or two, but is excruciatingly annoying on an entire album. Landing on Water is a much better example of Neil's 80s synth phase. It's not ovedone like Trans. Landing on Water's songs are better, AND you can actually hear Neil's great voice!"
2,This record really pissed me off,Why did neil young wanna sound like Krafwork anyway. Not really for neil young fans.
4,A great experiment...Seriously.,"There are two Neil Youngs on this album. About half of it is softer country rock type songs and the other half is experimental techno songs where he uses a vocodor to change his voice. It's the traditional songs that are weak on this CD. The synthesized songs like ""Computer Age"" and ""Sample and Hold"" are really great. I think he did more with those than Kraftwerk ever did because they are just great songs lyrically. Technology never sounded so heartfelt as on ""Computer Age."" IT's too bad he didn't do the whole album like those and ditch the limp sounding songs like ""Little Thing Called Love."" This is Neil at his experimental best and showed he wasn't afraid to try something radically different. The synthesizer stuff also holds up pretty well in my opinion. If you only like acoustic or even harder Young stuff you probably won't like this one but I think it's one of his most creative."
4,Trans-formation!,"The thing to remember about Neil Young is that he's not to be buried in one style of music;he prefers to surprise and challenge his audience. Believe me;David Geffen and Co. were more than a little surprised when Neil dropped his electronic masterpiece,TRANS,on their laps.TRANS explores the relationship between man and machine;how one uses the other to survive and thrive.SAMPLE AND HOLD is a satirical view on getting the perfect (manufactured)love partner.TRANSFORMER MAN represents Neil trying to communicate with his impaired son.WE R IN CONTROL shows us how much we are devoted to technology.The cold,keyboard driven remake of MR SOUL shows the widening gap between rock star and fan.The songs I'm not fond of are,oddly enough,the one's that sound like regular Neil Young.Predictably the critics and fans at the time couldn't understand what Neil Young was on about;now TRANS can be seen as an important work in the Neil Young canon."
4,Sounds just as good today as the day it was released !,"Do yourself a favor, get this recording as soon as you can and you will not be dissapointed. I think the best tracks are: 'Computer Age', 'Sample and Hold' and 'We are in Control'. This is Neil doing what he does best, making us fans smile."
4,"Like Greendale, Trans was ahead of its time.....","Neil Young is the undeniable master of innovation. 2003's Greendale is a prime example of Neil's willingness to take chances and approach new projects with a sense of unconventional wisdom. Trans is a prime example of Neil's ability to shock even his most adoring fans. Imagine it's 1982, and you've just picked up an LP of Trans at the local shop, enjoy the very typical first track ""Little Thing Called Love"". Next thing you know, Neil has strapped on the voice coder and has embarked on a futuristic tirade called ""Computer Age."" Songs like ""Transformer Man"" and ""Sample and Hold"" are hauntingly beautiful and far beyond their years. In short, the album grows on you. Finally, Trans concludes with the incredible ""Like an Inca"" which follows in the footsteps of Dangerbird and Cortez, reflecting Neil's obsession with Latin American/Native American themes of spirituality and perseverance."
5,sample this then hold it!,"Okay, I admit this is my mom's cd (gasp!) old hippy that she is. It's almost 20 years old (same as me, gasp again!) and it holds up well. I like the techno sound and the robot voices. This gets 5 stars for sample and hold alone."
4,Ahead of it's time,"Really, in 1982 this album was far ahead of its time lyrically. Take a listen to ""Computer Age"" and ""We R In Control"" with a lyric sheet in hand and you'll know why. Today, computers have an impact on virtually everything we do in life. Musically, this was a hard left turn into oncoming traffic for Neil as this was very different from anything that he had previously recorded. Now that we know Neil's reasons for recording this as he did (the inability to communicate with his son), the album has a dual meaning. It is time that Neil or Geffen/Universal re-release this album stateside as it's time has come.PS-In my opinion, Re-ac-tor was the first hint of this inability to communicate. Notice how everything is spelled out in syllables on the album cover."
2,neil young trans,"Bought it onlyto replace my vinyl. Only listened to the record twice, and didn't like it. put the cd on, and all of a sudden I could appreciate it. Not because it was on a cd, because I read his bio and I understood why he recorded it. It's quite good, don't know why I like it now as I hate electrronica, but there you go."
5,Shiseido moisturizer,"I absolutely LOVE Shiseido products! This moisturizer did not disappoint. I live in a tropical climate and my skin is still dry in some spots, so I love the weight of this product. I feel like it keeps my face moist throughout the day. I would definitely purchase this again and recommend to my friends for sure!"
4,Great for the office,"This stays in my stereo at work, and is perfect for ""those days.""These CD's are excellent resources for those who don't realize some of the musical heritage has been lost by the Church and needs to be reclaimed."
3,this item IS your money's worth of masterworks,"this recording is worth the money to buy, especially since it has two c.d.s inside. the songs are indeed fine music, many of the masterworks which you ""need"" to have. but it is neither the finest recording, nor is it a collection of the finest performances. i am in a near-spectacular choral group which performs these works, and i tend to get overly emotionally involved with grand art. so it is especially helpful, that like the other reviewer said, you can consider playing this through an audio player at your workplace."
5,THE Book for Lifestyle SUCCESS!!!!,"If YOU are sick of DIETS, ""miracle pills"", ""food plans"" and books guaranteeing success, then THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU!!! Demetre is a ""survivor"" of the ""diet wars"" and combines her first hand experience, her profession as a nurse and her devotion to Jesus Christ to give us a Biblically based plan of TRUTH. While others seem to complicate the process, Demetre has so thoroughly researched the industry and subjected the program to the Biblical ""grid"" of truth, that she is able to simplify everything so that it FINALLY makes sense! BUY this book and you will NEVER have to go on a diet again (or torture yourself with another book, plan, pill or creme)!!!"
1,a real bad book,"Most writers write to convey information to the reader while a few write to display their knowledge and their vocabulary. Mr Touches does the later. If you met him he would begin spouting everything and fact that he knew in the same way he does in this book simply to astound you. I f you like Emett Miller, buy his CD and skip this book.This writer is a boor."
3,MY DAUGHTER LIKED IT!!,"MY MOTHER PURCHASED THIS CAR FOR MY 7 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER. MY LITTLE GIRL LOVED IT. SHE PROPS HER ARM OVER THE SIDE LIKE SHE'S REALLY BIG. IT'S ALSO REALLY EASY TO LOAD UP IN THE CAR. MY MOM HAS A CAMARO AND HAS NO PROBLEM FITTING IT INTO THE BACK OF HER CAR BECAUSE THE HANDLE IS REMOVABLE. THE ONLY SUGGESTION I HAVE IS THAT THE CAR NEEDS DIFFERENT WHEELS. WE LIVE ON A COUNTRY ROAD, AND THE WHEELS ARE SOOOO NOISY THAT YOU CAN'T HEAR A CAR COMING. ALSO, IT NEEDS A REMOVABLE FLOOR BOARD SO LITTLE ONES CAN DRIVE IT THEMSELVES LATER ON."
5,Buggy is a Life Saver,"We purchased the Push Around Buggy for our daughter when she was about 10 months old. The routine is after dinner, we take a ride. She adores this Buggy. When she's cranky, all I have to say is ""buggy ride"" and she perks right up and runs to the door. She is now 16 months old and getting a little big for it, but it has certainly done a great job at keeping her busy and occupied outside. She now prefers to push the buggy with her dolls or animals in it. This is a must-have toy for parents!!!"
5,Wonderful toy!,"This is a great toy! My daughter is 8 months old and loves it!!! It is great for taking a walk to the pool and not needing to to use the stroller. From the moment I put my daughter in this buggy at the store, she was all smiles!"
2,not a quiet stroll around the block,"I bought this buggy for my 11 month old for Easter. The seat belt is a great idea. The key and the horn don't seem to interest her. Plus when I pushed her around the block for a leisurely stroll, the noise from the big hard plastic wheels was really loud. It sounds like a cross between a rock tumbler and a ""hot wheel"" scooter when you push it on concrete or asphalt. I wish I would have gone with a kiddie trike now."
5,Great car~LOUD ride!,"My daughter thinks she is ALL that in her pink car!! This is the cutest stinkin' thing ever~~the whole neighborhood comments on it. Great seat belt and foot rests for added safety and comfort. Storage trunk for a coat, pacifier, snacks, drinks, keys, cell phone...or whatever you need to take with you. It is very loud ride though."
3,Adorable but too small for toddler,"When I saw this car online, I thought it would be perfect for my 15mo. old. Before purchasing it, we went to the store to try it out. My daughter loved it. Although true, the car allowed no room for growth (comparable to having your driver's seat pushed all the way up so that your knees are snug against the steering wheel). Not worth the money if your child is tall for their age."
5,KayAleah loved it!!!!,"when she opened it christmas morning she made her mama pull her all over in it and didn't want to get out and now i actually need another one at the same price, but purple in color let me know if you have any available...thanks"
4,convinient,"I BOUGHT THIS EASY TO ASSEBLE BUGGY 3 YRS AGO AND IT IS VERY WORTH IT. MY KIDS LOVE IT! . ALTHOUGH, I DON'T USE IT AS MUCH AS I USED TO, IT DOES COME IN HANDY AND MY KIDS ENJOY THE STROLL. I HONESTLY LIKE THIS BUGGY BECAUSE IT IS PRETTY SAFE(COMES WITH AN AJUSTABLE SEAT BELT) AND IS PRETTY DURABLE AND LIGHT WIEGHT. ANOTHER THING I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS BUGGY IS THAT IT CAN BE WIPED DOWN WITH JUST A DAMP CLOTH...NOTHING DIFFICULT TO IT REALLY :)"
4,Great for our one year old (and sister loves it too!!),"Bought this for our one year olds birthday-she loves it, and so does her almost three year old sister, who fits in it just as well. Easy to assemble. All pieces there, plus spares. Easy to get around. Could do with a cup holder or something!"
4,Push Around Buggy (pink),"Our grandaughter loves to be able to ""drive"" as we push her. Buggy is durable and great for toddler age."
5,Great little buggy!,"this car is the best purchase I have bought for my daughter as of yet! She absolutely loves to sit in and ""drive"". I bought it for her when she was able to sit up sturdily at 6 months. Its a good thing to have when you just want to take them for a quick walk to the park, it even has storage under the hood! as for the road noise, i havent even noticed it, once i did its not much louder than the typical big wheel we all had as kids.this is a bargain for the price.....she loves it, thats all that matters, it makes her smile and giggle and thats all mommy needs!"
3,"Great product, Poor Attention to Detail with respect to packaging","We are very please with the product as a whole, however, there were parts missing with the original shipment. We were sent a replacement that also had pieces missing. I am more than disappointed with Step One and attention to detail. We ordered this product back in July, it is now almost September and we are still awaiting the correct parts to arrive."
5,Great Gift!!,"After reading all the reviews I decided to buy this for my Granddaughter for her 1st birthday...it was her favorite gift and her mom saved it for last knowing once she saw it the rest of the gift opening would be over. She immediately climbed in, got buckled up, hands on the wheel at 10 & 2 and away she went. Her parents have been taking her out driving everyday since."
5,LOOOOOVE this buggy,I bought this toy when my daughter was 9 months old. It's GREAT. The chair is a good fit. The seat belt holds her fine. It's very durable and it's got such a cute design. I used to bring it to the mall and I would get stopped all the time from people who find it adorable and want to get it for themselves. I use it to take her for a walk around the block. And my daughter loves it. She puts her hands on the wheel and pretends to drive it. She even honks the horn. She just loves it. I would definitely recommend this toy. And the fact that it's editor's choice show's ya something. =)
3,Fun 4 A while......,"I bought this for my 19 month old daughter. Things that I like about it are: Cute, Straps and Durable. Negatives: Sides are open to expose legs... easy for child to put foot down while being pushed. I think this is dangerous and my daughter did this often. I would like to see side panels put on this car. Also, the trunk opens easy if child is standing in front of car.. however, my child was constantly trying to open it from a seated position in the car... since the trunk opens near the ground level she had to reach that much more to try to open, hence a potential hazard for falling right over the front of the car head first. Try telling a 19 month old not to open trunk while seated in car... impossible! All in all very cute... but constant parent supervision is needed."
5,Excellent for the summer !!!,"I purchased this buggy over the Memorial Day weekend and it was very practical. My daughter only eight months old loved it once she saw it and when we put her on she didn't want to get off. We had a few BBQs to go to and the buggy saved us and allowed my daughter to enjoy the outdoors. Plus, it has a storage compartment in the front; I was able to fit two bottles, diapers and a travel wipe case."
5,Good for advanced gardeners,This is a great resource for advanced gardeners interested in learning about a variety of species within a genus. I have been able to identify many lesser known plants that I have inherited using this book. It tells in-depth information about the genus and lists several species with pictures of many of the species. There is very little info about when plants bloom or where they should be planted. I found this book very interesting and loved seeing the lesser known varieties of common plants. I would not have found this useful when I was a beginner gardener looking for advice on how to keep plants purchased at the local nursery alive.
5,Great for beginners,Bought this for a housewarming gift for my daughter. Her new house had lots of plants come up this spring and she had no idea what they were. This will help her identify them all! Excellent book!
3,Good but missing,it's a full and complete guide listing of perennials but i wanted to read about the care of the plants as well. there is no info on the care of any of the plants in the book
2,Encyc. of Perennials,"The text of this book is excellent, however the print is tinybecause it is squeezesd into four columns per page.The pictures are just of the flower, and sometimes of half a flower.The book is missing the experiance of looking at a complete plant picture,which is an important aspect of good gardening books.All and all it's a disappointment."
4,"Good book, mostly about baseball","I liked this book. Sticks mostly to Willie's playing career with little about his personal life outside of baseball. Some nice anecdotes and comparisons with he, Mickey Mantle, and Duke Snider, stats per season, talks about relationships with the team managers and other players, etc.... really fun stuff.Not much off the field. Like, he never mentions Bobby Bonds, which was strange to me since Willie Mays became the Godfather for Barry Bonds when he was born in the mid-sixties. I'd recommend it, but this book didn't resonate with me like some other sports bios (Bill Russell's ""Second Wind"" and Jackie Robinson's ""I Never Had It Made"")."
4,"Same size, not same brand","Although not the same brand as advertised, they are the correct size and work well.I unpackaged one to try it out. No rips or tears.This is typical emergency blanket and is not designed for frequent use.As soon as you cover yourself with one of these you feel the heat radiating back into you.Is this what a baked potato feels like?Don't even think you'll get it back in the little package... just fold it up as tight as you can and stick a rubber band on it."
1,Never received,"I ordered these blankets on December 5. They were scheduled to be delivered between 12/10 and 12/28, but they never came. I emailed BK Industries TWICE and got no reply to either email. Amazon returned my money with no problems. I did see that other people had problems with this company (I shouldn't have bothered ordering from them) and I urged Amazon to reconsider allowing BK Industries to sell items on their site. I hope they make some changes."
3,Not what I ordered but works OK,I ordered a Quake Kare item but received a different brand. While the item I received works for my purposes I do not trust this seller anymore and will never order from them again.
3,Not Quake Kare,I bought these for emergency readiness so have not used them yet. I am giving the three star rating only because the retailer sent a different brand from what I ordered. If you want Quake Kare do not expect to get it here.
3,good for survival situations,"The product wasn't as thick and durable as I expected. But that's more my fault than the product. I think these blankets are ideal for emergency situations, but I don't think there something that would last if I reused them again and again due to how thin they are. I wish I would've have gotten something along the lines of an emergency bivy sack. There much more expensive but I would feel a lot safer knowing I had one."
1,Bait and Switch Seller,"I'd rate it if they sent me the item pictured in the advertisement. What I received was something different, made in China Dukal Corp. Survival Wrap. It appears I am not the only one who was mislead. So the one star is for the seller Medical Products Depot."
2,"52"" by 84"" is just too small","Unless you are a munchkin you will not be able to wrap this completely around yourself. The whole point of a space blanket, which doesn't generate any heat of its own, is to keep your body heat from escaping, so you must be able to get a pretty good closure. The more of you that is exposed to the air, the less effective this product will be at doing what it says it does."
5,Good product and a good price,"I bought a pack of four of these and put one in the glove compartment of each car. They will warm you for a while, or can be used as shade against a hot sun. I also cut one up into small pieces and slid the into a couple of pet beds. The dogs werent fond of the crinkly sound coming from their bed, but I cant scrape the cats off of them. I've seen a popular pet bed that is just a regular bed with a sheet of this stuff slipped between the pads, and thats pretty much what I made. These are also useful to drape over tender outdoor plants if you expect a frost, just weigh it down with rocks if its windy."
4,Great to have around.,"Perfect price for a piece of emergency great that you should always have around. For the price that you would normally pay for just one blanket, you get 4. Definitely a great buy."
5,Bought for emergency,"I bought these for emergencies for the family. Hopefully, they will not have to be used, but just in case..."
1,blankets,where are the blankets?? never got them in the mail or it was stolen ;-( I have emailed the seller 3 times--nothing from them at all!!! Im not happy with the seller at all because they never responded...
1,Junk.,"I bought these blankets 2 1/2 years ago and hadn't had occasion to use one. It's a good thing. I opened one today to use as a ground sheet. The reflective lining was missing over most of the blanket, The (very thin) film stuck together making it impossible to unfold without tearing. It was completely unusable as an emergency blanket, I'm glad I checked one. The rest will go in the trash."
3,Not product I ordered,I bought these emergency blankets last summer and just now read many people received the wrong item.I did receive four blankets but they were Ever Dixie. these blankets are not quake care.That really ticks me off!!!! I never realized untill I looked in my grab and go bag won't order from big fly sports again.I can't tell you if rhese blankets will hold up or not because I have not used them yet. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE ITEM DESCRIBED
2,Waste of money,Recommended not to purchase. TH product isnt a very good quality and build type. I returned mine and purchased another one from a local store.
3,Blankets probably okay but not what was ordered,"Blankets received in timely fashion, but they were not exactly what was ordered.Instead of 3 packs of 4 blankets of the type advertised and displayed, what wasshipped was a pack of 12 blankets by a different manufacturer. Not used yet, sohard to tell if they are as good (or even better) than what was ordered. But whenI order a specific item, I expect to receive ""that"" item. There was not even anexplanatory e-mail or enclosed paper as to why the ordered items were substituted.Even if the substituted items are of good quality, it raises serious concerns as tothe credibility of the merchant and whether Amazon should be representing them. I haveseveral other items on order from BP through Amazon, so I will wait to see if thispractice of unannounced product substitution is a regular pattern. But buyers shouldbeware that what they order might not be what they get."
5,Hopefully they'll stay in the bag.,"I honestly hope I never have to use these blankets, and they stay in those little ziploc bags. But if I need one, I now have one in each vehicle, one with me, and one in the emergency kit at home."
4,Hope I never need them,Purchased these to put in our cars and our emergency preparedness kit. It would be great if I never open the package.
1,Product received not the same as product pictured,"Product received was not Quake Care and it was not made from Mylar. The blankets I received were ""similar"" to the ones pictured."
1,Bait and Switch. Do not buy!,"Same problem as the other bad reviews. They say you will get Quakecare mylar, but what you get is Everdixie rescue blanket, which is aluminized non-stretch polyester. I just hope they hold up when I really need them. Maybe i'll use 1 and see how it holds up and update my review if it's totally horrible."
1,"NOT QUAKE KARE, shoddy substitute from universalmedical","Did not receive the premium quality Made in USA ""Quake Kare"" brand that I ordered paid for, I got ""PRIMACARE"" blanket MADE IN CHINA from seller universalmedical instead. Unacceptable bait and switch by this seller. Amazon took it back though."
3,Notes,"I couldn't say how they hold up, as I don't intend to use them unless I have to, but I wanted to note that I did not recieve a four-pack of those shown above. I recieved 4 individual packages of a brand not shown when I ordered this. Fine with me, but if you're shooting for something specific, you may not get it."
1,Never got items ordered,This vendor is a total fraud. I never received the items I ordered. I went on their reviews board and it turns out that they are scamming people as a false business. Do not do any business with these criminals.
2,"2 or 3 good songs, the rest is mediocre","When I bought this cd I remember I got impressed by the first two songs; it's not that they're hits but 'No meat-no man' and 'Don't Blow Your Top' are good songs, which made me anticipate a very good album; but the rest of the songs are mediocre accumulations of instrumental passages and samples, repetitive and usually boring, lacking the fantastic beat changes of Skinny puppy; in fact these songs sound TO ME as insipid instrumental songs sounding as blurred 242 or puppy songs. Maybe 'Disgust' is the only which does add anything interesting, the rest are boring and makes a neverending listening out of this cd; I usually end up skipping the songs and changing it for some Puppy cd."
4,"Top Blown, Sorry","DBYT picks up where What do you know leaves off. The title track is one of the highlights. It is followed up by Disgust that I'm always confusing with Nihil's Disobedience. The songs are only similar phoneticly but both are just as cool and well produced. The song What a race is some kind ode to Nascar or the Kentucky Derby as near as I can figure out from it's content. Whatever it's about it's a groovy tune. Oh look is odd but interesing. DBYT is not as complete or well rounded as it's predicessor nor does it have as much grit, but it is a catchy record with a few treats."
2,What the HELL is this?,"KMFDM is my favorite band. By far. I have just about every song they have ever made, either on MP3 or CD. However, I have NEVER liked this album. With wierd meandering songs and repetitive and annoying drums, this is truly the strangest album ever made by KMFDM. When thinking of everything that makes KMFDM good, I think: awesome beats, intelligent lyrics, and sweet guitar riffs. This album has no lyrics (for the most part). It has songs with intrusive and annoying beats, just listen to Killing (for your sampling kit). And it has very little guitar."
5,Excellent,Beautifully written. Several points hit very close to home for me. I found It is very approachable and readable..highly recommended.
5,A Path with Heart,"I was pleasantly surprised that ""A Path with Heart"" offers a practical approach to living more simply in modern society and removing unwanted ""noise"" that had become commonplace in my own ""hi tech"" lifestyle. A good read with practical exercises. I found it most helpful to read just one chapter per week to incorporate each principal into daily living."
5,The best tool for a beginner,I have been looking for a change in my life for some time now. This is the only book I have read that makes me really understand the spirituality of Buddhism. It definately has worked miracles in my life.
3,Wordy but useful,"Several meditation books have been written with less words. Anecdotes are good for instructors, some techniques are ok, but overall this book is not as inspiring as others (like Trungpa's). Sometimes it gets too soft. Buddhism tends to shake things up and provide sharp truths about ourselves. But somehow, A Path with Heart feels too cloudy. As if written from one of the heavenly realms."
2,So Many Words,"For some reason psychotherapy and Buddhism mixed together seem to create joyless writers. This is no exception.Here is a lawyer joke. Lawyer tells his client, ""I can write a 10 page opinion for 2 thousand dollars or a 2 page opinion for 10 thousand dollars. Which do you want?"" We have the 10 page version.Beware of authors who use their own quotes to begin each chapter. We are not talking modest. Why in the world would I want to read a quote as the kickoff of each chapter taken from the chapter itself? Perhaps the next edition will come underlined by the author.There are many other books that cover the same ground with more wit, more depth and fewer words. Seek them out."
2,very used,"Too many previous notes all through the book, very used but described as "" lightly used""C Cripps"
1,Buy a different edition!,"Good grief -- the other reviewers of this book clearly did not buy it, but are arguing about Blake's theology and using this Website to do it.I have no comment on the poem. It needs no defense and has fully established itself in Western culture.But as for the *book*, the object you hold in your hands and look at, I do have a few words. This is a very poorly produced, poorly bound, amateurishly laid out book containing appalling reproductions of the art. It was pretty obviously created in Microsoft Word and bound at the equivalent of a Kinko's. For twenty bucks you can do a lot better. I'm returning my edition."
2,Blake's Marriage of Heaven and Hell,"Many of the ideas in this book are very contradicting to the bible however he does bring up some good points. Read C.S. Lewis' responce to this book entiteled ""The Great Divorce""."
2,Contradicing the bible,"Many of the ideas in this book are very contradicting to the bible. Read C.S. Lewis' responce to this book ""The Great Divorce""."
3,work only OK,"works fine so far x 3 months. BIGGEST problem, the holes on the side of the boat are NOT pre-drilled, need to be drilled with machinery yourself - takes about 30 minutes to get all holes open. Would not recommend with the extra work"
3,"not a bad flick, but i'm Really here to praise. . .",". . . the presence of the great-named jack black, who's currently enjoying a bit of a heydey due to his record-shop turn in ""high fidelity"". i've noticed him for some time now in films such as ""bob roberts"", ""enemy of the state"", getting his just bazookaing in ""the jackal"", and of course his initially off-putting tenacious d appearances. but in skidmarks his usual, wanna-punch-him-in-the-face snideness shined brightest in what may be his ultimate perfect role- a greasy burger clown proprietor who ends up with a bullet in the brainpan! :D we LOVE this guy- he's to character-acting in the 90s what david patrick kelly was in the 80s! :) vt"
4,Love Uno and Free Fall,"If you like playing Uno, the DS version is a great portable version to play on the go, or when there is no one else around to play the card game with. Uno Free Fall is an awesome Tetris like game with an Uno twist."
4,Entertaining variety of games,"I found this game to be entertaining for the whole family. My six year old plays UNO Free Fall and UNO on her own. I really like the UNO Free Fall although after a while it gets boring and unchallenging. However, if you enjoy games like UNO and solitaire, you will most likely enjoy this game as well. The music was a bit annoying, but I did like the ability to change screen backgrounds."
3,some issues,"I bought this game specifically for the skip BO game I find it extremely annoying that towards the end of a challenge game cards disappear so I can't see whats in my hand. (not a ds issue, it does the same thing on my sons ds) overall though it's fun to play"
4,Fun,"Fun, fun, fun... I am so glad I got this. Just like old times...remember playing these actual card games. So glad now I can play them on my handheld."
4,Nintendo DS Uno game,Really nice game. Very easy to play. I like the game on cards and now like it also on the DS.
1,You'll be playing UNO solo!,"We got this game for our 12-year-old UNO-loving son for Christmas. 4 family members have a Nintendo DS, and we were excited to play it all together. HA! Turns out if you buy this game, you'll be playing UNO solo--in order to play wirelessly, EVERYONE must own his/her own copy of the game. We sure feel duped! Our son cast the game aside almost instantly after discovering this. If we could return it, we would."
2,OK game,"This game is pretty good. I do have 2 problems with it though. My first and biggest problem is you can't play single card multi-player. Everyone must own their own copy to play with each other. My other problem is the ""computer"" partners make very stupid moves and sometimes give away the game. Overall, I still enjoy playing the game."
4,Want to learn to paint in Photoshop?,"Then this is the book for you! Bert Monroy shares techniques on how to create realistic digital paintings in Photoshop 7.0. This book has a wealth of information demonstrating techniques such as smoke blazing off a red stiletto shoe, weather precipitation such as fog hanging in trees and rain pouring down on buildings. In chapter 5 you will learn how to create weathered wood, bark on a tree and metal objects along with a host of other realistic textures. The chapters are well thought out and organized with corresponding screenshots throughout.This book will best be served by the novice or intermediate user. Nonetheless, novice or expert you'll come away with a new fresh perspective on digital painting and an ability to express yourself in those paintings like never before."
5,Amazing Book - Inspiring Author,"Till I saw this book and Bert Monroys website my imagination and creativity for minimally very finite. Its amazing how he shows what can be done using image editors like photoshop. Its just blows you away. My wife thought the pictures in his books are photographs and when I told her bert monroy created them in photoshop, there was no sound from her. She was quite amazed. This book is well recommended. Authors like Bert Monroy truly amazes with their talent and give us additional thoughts and inspiration on how to improve our work."
4,master of texture,"Bert Monroy has put out another winner. This book is full of beautiful images, but more importantly it's full of great techniques like how to create smoke effects, burled wood, rain, snow etc... Plus it has a really nice section on how to make all sorts of reflections on different surfaces. If you need to create photorealistic effects, this book is for you."
3,Disappointing Disc,This is wonderful music and I was delighted to find a recording of the complete opus 2 and not just a selection of one or two sonatas. Played on authentic instruments by an Italian group I thought I could not go wrong. However the playing is lack lustre with generally too slow tempos and very little light and shade. The overall sound is also rather dead. Great music but not the best interpretations or recorded sound.
4,Perfect for busy yards.,"This sandbox is the answer to prayers. Not only is it sturdy with a good cover (that neighborhood pets cannot defeat) but it is also nice to look at. We had been everywhere, looked at everything but either the boxes were way too poorly built or they were way too gaudy. It's nice to have kids around but it doesn't have to look like it all the time. For a nice yard that is both garden and playground it is a perfect fit."
5,Lots of DR SEUSS!,3 1/2 year old daughter LOVES this DVD. Plenty of variety and nostalgia for mom :)
5,Classic Dr. Suess that the child in all of us will love,"I remember these videos from my childhood and now my kids are enjoying them too. My 2 yo son loves me to read the Cat in the Hat and Green Eggs and Ham over and over. I thought this would be a great visual addition to our regular reading and all three of my kids love it. Of course there are several more great stories on the DVD as well. A great way to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Dr. Suess. Plus, you can't beat Alan Sherman as the Cat's voice."
3,Grinch fans stay away,"I bought this for my wife for the cartoon with the Grinch in it. Trust me, it is not the same ""Grinch"" as the one who stole Christmas. Sure, he sorta looks like that Grinch and intends to behave like that Grinch, but overall it just was not the Grinch. It was rough for us to watch and ended up being one of the worst Dr. Suess stories I have ever seen. This movie might be good for kids, but not for fans of the Grinch."
4,Classics,"All the classics are on this DVD. You wouldn't think Dr. Seuss would be bad for young children since the books are great for first time readers but my son starting pointing aggressively and saying ""NO"" and ""OUT"" just like the fish does to the Cat in the Hat when we would ask him not to do something. There is always at least one character that is angry."
3,Hydrology book,"I think the book is organized well and it is very thorough. I am taking a Hydrology class and we are using this as our textbook. The professor says he has used this book as long as he remembers and he has been teaching the class for over 8 years. He thinks the text is good, but he does not think there are good example or homework problems."
2,Best Hit To Short,"Her Big Hit Since I Fell For You Is Too Short, This Is The Short Short Version. If You Like Laure Find The Long Version."
3,Clayton Moore's Last movie.,I have been a big fan of the Lone Ranger for most of my life. I probably expected more but after watching the DVD I felt like I had just watched a TV series of the Lone Ranger. It did give some history at the begining and the color version was very vivid. As usuall the Ranger and Tonto's part was played very well. I would recomend this to anyone who is a fan also. God bless the Lone Ranger and Tonto for giving us hero's to look up to.
5,Lone Ranger & City of GOld,This is a great movie about Clayton Moore's version of the Lone Ranger. The quality of production is so much greater than the TV series as you can tell they had more money to work with. Clayton Moore is the Lone Ranger!
3,Moore and Silverheels Ride Into the Sunset,"Filmed in Tucson, ""The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold"" (1958) was the second and last theatrical feature based on the classic television series. Directed with no-nonsense flair by veteran Lesley Selander, this colorful Western also marked the final screen performances of Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels in their iconic roles. Solid family entertainment - distinguished by dark and violent elements not found in the TV version."
4,"Works, How do they do that.","My three boy's choose this 30 min. Video when they only have a little time befor the have to go to bed. The are fascinated to see how Glas gets recycled, or paper made out of wood. The way it is presented appeal to there age of 9,7,6 years.If you want your child to understand how things work, this is made to watch again and again."
2,Lukewarm at best.,"Having read an article about this band recently in Guitar Player magazine in which one of the guitarists was compared to Derek Trucks, and that the band was like an ""Allman Bros"" band for the new millenium, I figured that was all I needed to convince me to buy.My mistake. Now, that's not to say that these boys aren't good players. They are. Everyone in the band is proficient on their instruments, and the lead singer has a strong voice.But, the songs are pretty weak - both lyrically and melodically, and there's no one in the band who stands out as a ""world class"" player. to compare their slide player to Derek Trucks was doing Derek a great disservice! that's not to say that the guy can't play - he can. But there's no originality in his style, and certainly none of the fire that Trucks is famous for.Same goes for the rest of the band. Everyone's decent - just no stand outs.This one will go on Ebay."
3,Off to Rio,"Don't expect Shakepearean plotting in these musicals - BUT - do expect to see Astaire & Rogers in their partnership debut in the supremely silly Flying Down To Rio. What a great beginning! And you probably don't remember the Castles (who does?) but the dancing in The Story Of... is enormously satisfying. Any road, can you ever have too much of A&R? Just grab a beverage, plop down, and watch Ginger keeping up with Fred (and in high heels! and dancing backwards!)"
3,measure wheel for hard surfaces,"this is an inexpensive product very suitable for measuring along pavement, sidewalks or any hard surface. cheaply made but not a bad value for the money. Doesn't sweat much for a fat girl."
5,Works OK.,"It works OK. The handle could be longer, but it's not flimsy. This measuring wheel is a good deal for anyone who doesn't need professional-grade durability."
3,Does the job but not for everyday use.,"This is a decent product. I wouldn't call it great but it gets the job done. I really only plan to use it once or twice a year. For my purposes it is great. However, if you plan to use this often I would definitely pay for a better item. It does not seem very sturdy or high quality."
4,A good value for little money,"In my work in facilities I used to measure a 70,000 sq ft. building counting ceiling tiles and a measuring tape. This job used to be tedious and demanding. Results took several days and were not accurate. Since I bought this measuring wheel, all area calculations are really simple and in a shorter time. I just have to get a piece of paper, my measuring wheel and start rolling to get and accurate footage reading in no time. Since I used it indoors the size of the wheel no matters. I guess this will be and issue if I were measuring a farm.I have been using this product for about two years and it has been one of the best tools and investments. Unluckily, the handle of this wheel is weak and I had to replace it with a stick of wood. Since then, it has been doing a wonderful job."
3,Completely missing the black clips to close box,"The package arrived in a timely manner but this Plano box was completely missing the two black clips that hold the box closed. I'm attempting to contact someone about getting this fixed, but expect the hassle of having to ship this back to return it it will not be worth it.Even with missing the clips, the box still serves its purpose. Its just mediocre that the clips would be completely gone."
2,not very happy,well when i got this in the mail it was alot smaller than what it looked liek in the pic beffore i ordered it.it also was a slow delivery as well not impressed at all
4,Great for storing lego pneumatics,I recently got some lego pneumatics in the mail from lego education and this storage container fit them perfectly. A little smaller than what they look like
3,"Annoying & Overpriced, but convenient now!","This was kind of expensive for what it is, and it was really annoying to have to get a razor and carefully seperate the subdividers from each other so that they'd fit in nicely. But I guess that's just a one time thing, and now that it's setup, its great to have some organization, and to be able to see in through the lid to quickly find what I'm looking for."
4,Watch the descriptions like a hawk,"These Pro-Latch boxes are really handy for small stuff and are pretty sturdy. However, be careful ordering them at Amazon, it's easy to order one of different size or shape than you want, which is what happened to me. My fault, not Amazon's, but just a word of warning."
2,Broke way to easily,"After filling with hot water several times, the glass cracked, and then broke. Maybe it was a faulty one. Wil try to return it, but that's a hassle... arg."
4,Seems to fit a tad tighter than what came with the coffee press.,"Seems to fit a tad tighter than what came with the coffee press, but the quality is the same. No major complaints."
4,Cheaper than replacing the entire thing,"I was on Amazon searching for a new french press because I cracked the old one, when I came across the replacement beaker. I wish I had known sooner that was even an option. The beaker fits into the stand perfectly but it seems like the plunger is a little loose. It's as if the beaker is just a tad bigger. It still works and I'm pleased with it."
4,Useful,Almost as expensive as a new bodum. I did find that it is shaped ever so slightly differently so that it is difficult to get the plunger out to empty the grounds. However it does the job.
2,Breaks too easily,Bodum has to figure out how to make a beaker that doesn't break- this is ridiculous. I love this French press but find that replacing the beaker multiple times makes this product too expensive to use. It withstands the dishwasher great but does not tolerate the SLIGHTEST ding on a hard surface- I am not exaggerating. They do not replace beakers that have been broken this way. Maybe Bodum needs to create a plastic beaker product? Go with a filter and save your money.
2,Bodum Glass Beaker 3 cup,I was mislead by the 3 cup description. This 3 cup means three four ounce meansurements which came to a 12 ounce capacity. There was no way to know by the description that this was what I was ordering. I also found that some of the Peets Coffee stores carry them in stock.
2,A tiny bit too small,"Looks exactly the same as the broken one it replaced, but unfortunately it is a tiny bit smaller. This means it falls out of the plastic frame if you turn it upside down and the plunger is too tight so the metal screen gets damaged. The difference is probably under 1 mm but it makes a big difference in how it works..."
4,Works just fine,"After getting the press on a lark, I used it a few weeks and accidentially broke the glass. I bought this replacement and then went back to a tradtional drip maker. A year or 2 later the drip maker died and I went back to the press until I found another coffee maker I liked. I've been using the press now everyday for a couple of months with no further issues with the glass. I throw the glass and metal stand in the dishwasher as a single piece and it's not broken yet."
4,Replacement Beaker size-guide,"Bodum Replacement Beaker Size Guide3-cup = 12oz = 1 1/2 US Cups/Mugs4-cup = 16oz = 2 US Cups/Mugs8-cup = 32oz = 4 US Cups/Mugs12-cup = 48oz = 6 US Cups/MugsThe Bodum ""cup"" is actually 4oz whereas a US Cup/Mug is 8oz.For reference, a white mug from a diner is 8oz, a Starbucks ""Tall"" (their smallest size) is 12oz.I have Bodum presses in all the sizes and find that these fit perfectly. I am glad that I did not need to add more to the landfill by having to buy an entire coffee press just to replace the beaker."
3,"Don't Bother, Just Buy a New Press","Let me start with the good qualities of this item. Make no mistake, this is good quality glass ware and it came well packaged. I expected that because it is a genuine Bodum product.There is a big problem with the beaker, however; it does not fit all coffee press frames. While I was trying to insert it, I broke my frame. It still held the beaker, although less well than I'd like. I thought that my frame was just too old.However, when I tested the press, I found that the beaker was too large for the filter. I finally measured the beaker and found that it is about 2 mm too large for my frame and filter. This is troubling, because my press was a Bodum product as well.Therefore, I recommend that anyone considering this product should instead purchase a completely new coffee press instead. For a couple dollars more, you'll save yourself some grief.Don't buy this beaker unless you are 100% certain that it will fit your frame!"
2,Product just does not last,"I'll start by saying that I love my french press, use it almost every morning. Unfortunately, I do not love that the beaker cracks consistently after 4-6 months of daily use. I think the glass just can't handle the repeated rapid shifts in temperature. Just keep in mind, this is a great product but you might want to buy in bulk."
1,"defective glass, bad service","I love my little french press, so I ordered this replacement beaker when the old one broke. I've had it a few months but did not use it more than half a dozen times. Yesterday the glass just cracked for no apparent reason. I did not drop it or hit anything with it! I called Ace to tell them I thought the product was defective, but because it's been more than 30 days, the person on the phone told me he couldn't help me. I can buy a new press for less than they sell the replacement beaker for, so I may have to do that, but I try not to make more trash than I have to. Customer service is less than stellar here. I didn't feel like the guy on the phone was listening or gave a #$% about my request. He finally got me off the phone by saying he'd have his manager call me. Yeah, right. I'm not holding my breath."
3,I love the Coffee Press but not the Beaker,My new Coffee Press Beaker has broken twice in the past few months. Sigh. Be careful with them! I was happy to know I could order replacements off Amazon. Could they be made a bit stronger?
5,LOVE IT!,"I actually have it hanging on the wall behind me as I type this. Its perfect for my dorm room, adds some color and is even better than the picture. It also arrived on time. I would recommend this!"
1,sumguy,i didn't even get this shipped to me and this guy who i bought it from didn't even knowledge that i bought it. what is that?
3,Beware of the hype,"There are a few REAL hit songs, but there are other mysterious songs on this CD that are defintely NOT the orig artists! Some of them are horrible cover versions or songs most American Audiences never heard of. The sound is awful on some of these 'UN-ORIGNAL' versions -- they are redux! Look elsewhere if you want the REAL ""Hippie Hits""."
1,My newborn got a sore red butt after a week!,"I'm breastfeeding, so the baby tends to soil a lot more than if he was formula fed. Which means he's getting wiped a lot more. These are thick, not terribly soft but not the scratchiest. But they turned his little butt red within a week! I had samples of Pampers Sensitive- which were much better. Thinner, softer, and a bit moister. I also have the Lansinoh Clean & Condition wipes which were even better. I definitely won't be buying the Huggies wipes again- guess I'll use them to clean my preschoolers hands and such."
4,perfect for new borns,"these whips are perfect for new borns, but you should see what dosen't cause ""diaper rash"" bought these as a gift along with huggies newborn diapers 40 diapers... plus 8whips and then bought some for the baby so she or he has alot of whips,perfect for quick clean ups...hands, face. pampers are not good for a babys butt...(whips)"
4,Excellent value!,"My daughter fell in love with Beethoven after seeing the first movie. So of course she wanted to see the whole collection. Well buying the Pooch Pack is much cheaper than buying them separately, and heck, even cheaper than having to keep renting them all (ha)! This is a great collection of movies for little ones, and you can't beat the price. I just wish they spread them out more evenly, or over 3 discs instead of only 2 with the majority of them on the first one. I also don't care for the double sided DVDs, as my daughter is not used to handling that type and it could very well become scratched on one side. That reason causes this rating to lose 1 star. Other than that, you will love the Pooch Pack."
5,Beethoven was really awsome,I would highly recommend this movie to dog lovers this movie was simply awesome and would recommend it to anybody
2,"Looks used, Seller is no good","The DK Lego story itself is just fine and I am sure my nephew will enjoy reading it, but it arrived at my house in poor condition and I intended to give it as a present. When you purchase a new book, instead of a used one, you expect it to be...well NEW, but this book is worn. The corners of the cover and pages are dull and worn down, the binding seems broken in, and there is a deep crease in the corner of the book's front cover (as if someone dog tagged the cover). It was mailed to me in a flimsy paper mailing envelope instead of a box, so I am sure that contributed to it's condition. I would not buy from this seller, especially not paperback."
4,Very nice watch,"I use this watch for business trip all over the world, the function is very nice, the compass,temperature,weather forecast functions are very useful, especially, the baro-chart is very important to assist to judge the correct weather forecast. The color is very nice, but someone mentioned it would discolor, I think it should be, but not happen yet, because it always staid in a very good condition (only business trip), but if I go mountain-climbing, I suppose it might happen soon. Then why I did not give the 5 stars, the only disadvantage is the dual time mode, to show local and home town time in a same display is very very important during business trip, it can tell when I should call back to my company, and the display still has enough space to display the home town time, I think La Crosse should consider to improve this function. Anyway, this is still a useful watch for business trip!"
4,Great for beginners,"This is a great watch for people who are trying their hand at outdoor sports. It is easy to use and not too bulky. Wish is was made of a more durable material other than plastic, but like I mentioned it is great for a beginner to practice. It has all of the main functions of watches costing much more so it does the job. It is a very clean and smart looking watch."
3,Good watch for the money,"This watch is great for the money. It has several nice features including temperature reading, barometric pressure reading with 24 hour history, altitude reading with 24 hour history, digital compass. The only complaint I have is that the temperature reading while the watch is on your arm will not be correct. It senses your body temperature which will cause the reading to most often be higher than the actual temperature. To get an accurate reading you must take the watch off for at least 30 minutes. The altimeter reading is not accurate either but I think for the money it is good enough for everyday use. Even though I was disappointed with the temperature and altimeter readings, I still think it is a good watch for the money."
2,Feels like a toy on your wrist,"My wife bought me this watch because I said I had to have it. However when it arrived I noticed it looked and felt like a watch a child would own. I'm saying it felt like a cheap plastic toy on my wrist. It reminded me of something Lego would make for kids or Transformers, but sadly this watch doesn't transform into something cool. I love La Crosse Technology and I'm confident the watches ability to measure nature is precise, but the shell its in is weak.I love the watches functions, but hate the way it's made. I hope the company re-releases this model, making it more durable to stand up to the elements it measures."
1,Lacross does not support product,"I purchased the XG-55 (as a replacement) prior to an adventure race. We didn't use it in that race and the next time I needed it was several months later. The battery had died and a new battery would not revive the watch/altimeter. Once I finally reached customer support, they just told me ... 'Sorry. Yeah that can happen. Tough luck. Bye'"
4,a good watch,very good product it is all that is just a little thing mark. altimeter must often be calibrates
3,La Crosse Technology XG-55 Digital Altimeter/Compass Watch,"I purchased this item on January 2009, it died this year on February (not a battery problem). It's altimeter was not very accurate. It's my fault, I was expecting a lot more from a cheap watch.La Crosse Technology XG-55 Digital Altimeter/Compass Watch"
1,Not really water resistant,I recently purchased this watch for my husband. It was advertised as water resistant to 50 ft.+ He wore it into the water at Bahia Honda in Florida for a total of 1 1/2 hours and it stopped working. When we took it to watch repair they said they'd never seen such a bad case of rust and it couldn't be repaired. We were able to return it and get our money back. Buyer beware.
1,Water Resistant?! Nice joke.,"Within the first month I had to replace this product because it had condensation on the inside. The customer service told me that it is not water resistant despite the logo of a guy swimming on the back of the watch and ""30 feet water resistant"". Just this week, after having been very careful not to get it wet, and taking it off before jumping in the shower, the new watch got more condensation in it and stopped working. It must have been the steam in the shower!! Terrible buy. I wish they would reimburse the purchase or issue a recall. This is not something an American company should be producing."
2,Fair to Midland,"Found this watch to have cool features and easy to setup. Easy to use.Only problem is the information it gives was not always right! Altitude was close but varied from 30' to 170' OFF. Barometer was never right and calibrated correctly. maybe works better staying outside. Commercial buildings are pressurized, could be the issue??? Temp was as instructed, must be removed from wrist for several minutes to get ambient temperature; that was accurate. Compass was jerky and hard to settle down, not fluid-like movement but accurate outside. Compass was also too sensitive, would not work near metal i.e. in the vehicle or aircraft, near other electronics. Oh and the watch keeps good time :{)I returned mine to upgrade to better quality and accuracy. If you're just looking for it to be close, this is a good watch for the price."
1,Great watch: Not recommended,"It is sad not to recommend this wonderful watch. It has great features and design. The price is very good also. So what's wrong? Wear it in the shower once and it's ruined despite being marked water resistant to 100ATM. LaCrosse says their warranty does not cover damage from water leaking in because they say it is not waterproof and should not get wet. Duh? Then why do they advertise ""water resistant"" as a feature? Lacrosse customer service told me not to believe what it says on the watch or the specs. The reality is the watch can't get wet. And I can't recommend it. At least it has a weather indicator so I know when it's gonna rain."
1,Metallic Look but case made of plastic and breaks easily,"I had this watch for a few months, and feature wise it meets all my expectations, but I snagged it in my backpack the other day and the strap with the pins came off. No big deal I thought, I'll just snap it back in - that's when I noticed that the strap holder had ripped through the PLASTIC casing and was thus unrepairable. Over the few months I have had it, it has also discolored badly on the fake metal casing. Great features, poor build quality. Not recommended."
3,XG-55 Watch reveiw,"The functionality of this watch is excellent and the price is pretty good for it's type and features. The down side to this watch is that it's very fragile for use in outdoor sports like hiking, climbing, hunting or, camping. The functions seem geared to that kind of activity and its advertised for outdoor living but materials used in it's casing are somewhat cheap.Watch is only rated water resistant to 30 feet. I have personally never seen an other watch rated so low and still clam to be ""water resistant"". For those that understand the pressure rating system a 30 feet rating is extremely low and I would not personally consider it water resistant at all.If your good at taking care of your equipment this could be a useful tool for you but don't expect it to be able to take the level of abuse that most other outdoor sport watches can."
2,Fair,"I received this watch as a gift after reviewing several others. The display is very good. The altimiter is usually way off and varies greatly even remaining in the same position. It is a little difficult to make use of all the watch's features. I am very concerned the watch is stamped on the back ""water resistant"" but new reports are showing it is not. In fact if it is NOT, we have been misled by the manufacturer. Overall, I can not recommend this watch"
1,"Poor watch, poor customer service","This watch's altimeter did not funtion correctly; I live on the ocean so I could calibrate it to sea level, five minutes later it would read -89 feet or something rediculous. It had to be reset all the time. Customer service was no help as they did not know how to work the functions on the watch. Wait for the bugs to be worked out beofre purchasing this item. Also, this watch was rated for 100 feet but flooded at 30 feet."
5,360 Degree Selling-Is An Outstanding Book!,"The book 360 Degree Selling covers two of the most important areas in the selling of biotechnology products, use of clinical trial data, and disease state information. This information is exactly what today's physicians most want from pharmaceutical sales people. Additionally, the book has great information on relationship selling and physician personality styles, and a very extensive section on territory management. I highly recommend this book to anyone in pharmaceutical sales, I know it has helped me to be more effective in my sales presentations."
3,Basic Sales Text,"With 10 years of sales expereince (within Pharmaceutical, Device, and Biotech indutries), it is my opinion that this book is for the sales beginner or someone just trying to get in to the industry. There is a chapter on clinical studies and how to critically read, understand and then present data in a sales call that matters to the customer. This chapter is very good for someone that is learning how decipher a clinical reprint down to a ""p-value"", but the rest is very, very basic information from call routing to call planning. I bought this as a possible sales tool in training new biotech representatives w/o sales experience, but I have found better texts available that do not have ""biotech"" in the title."
5,The Future Is Now,The sheer momentum of the author's imagination and consummate skill in delivering the visual evidence was a big surprise. This book is a must-have for those whose vision of the future soars beyond the predictable Trekoidal Sword and Sandal stereotypes. Kofoed mixes wild fantasy into a look at what might be reality in the next Millennia or two.Great fun for adults and for kids!
5,Nostalgia,"I used to have this book, and my Dad used to read it to me when I was a kid. I found it on amazon and wanted to share it with my nieces and nephews. I'm pleased that it's still in print and my nieces are happy to have received it. I hope it creates fond memories for them as it did myself."
3,Thomas Kinkade Bible,"Bible was beautiful! However I wish the person who sold it would have been honest and posted the actual condition of the Bible I bought from them. Some pages were bent, the corners of the outside hardcover was really torn. Bible was definently used and not in good shape."
5,Awesome author,Followed this author for years. Am now rereading the book that I read in my youth! Love her books and style of writing-drawsyou in...
5,Cashelmara,"If you have ever read the history of the Plantagenets it is easy to see that Cashelmara is the prequel toThe Wheel of Fortune. Although the families are not the same in each book, the story corresponds with the Plantagenets' history. I kept thinking that the stories must be linked because The Wheel of Fortune began where Cashelmara ended. Years later, I read a 4 volume history of the Plantagenets and sure enough, the events in Cashelmara were also the events leading up to the events in The Wheel of Fortune. Very interesting."
4,A Book with some Strange Twists,"I love every book I've ever read by this author. Cashelmara was different from some of her other books (although I haven't read that many) in that the author included some moral topics that I hadn't encountered or had expressed in such detail as it was in Cashelmara. I easily finished this very long book, and enjoyed it, but it wasn't my favorite so far."
2,Susan's Worst!,This is a pretty good book if you like to read about people (especially spoiled whiny ones) moving back and forth between Ireland and London every other page. Ms. Howatch certainly wasted her talent on this book. Read Penmarric instead. It is one of Ms. Howatch's best.
5,A Walk in the Clouds,"Why anyone who loves True romance wouldn't love this movie is besides me. The Editoral Review states Keanu as being total wooden, which is as far from the truth as I can see. I think Keanu plays his role excellent! He is so compelling as the hero that is just a little shy, but still wants to do the right thing to help out a lady in distress even tho he doesn't even know her. Making sacrifices in his own life to save her face with her family, and then finally falling in love with her. If you think true romance is dead, then see A Walk in the Clouds, you'll believe again!"
1,Dissapointed,"When I received the package I realized that I had been sent the wrong movie. I ordered ""A Walk in the Clouds."" I was mailed ""A Walk to Remember."" I paid the shipping to mail the incorrect DVD back to the vendor and now over a month later I still have not received the movie I originally purchased. I am frustrated at the money and time wasted. I am also dissapointed in the lack of concern on the vendor's part. They told me they never received the incorrect DVD back and that was the last I heard from them."
1,Why?,"I have one question, how can ANYONE possibly rationalize putting Keanu Reeves in ANY movies. This movie was just incredibly horrible. It was SO predictable, and the fire at the end, I think my 2 year old brother could make a more realistic fire. If you rent this movie, kiss your heard earned money goodbye, this is one of the worst movies ever without Keanu, but with Keanu, well you see for yourself"
4,Great Minus 1,"This is one of my classic stand-bys for when I want an escape. I love the lush scenery, the realistic plot, and the integrity of the script. The only real detraction for me in this is (obviously) Mono-Keanu. The guy can't act his way out of a wet paper bag but, luckily, his acting isn't bad enough to sink the ship. One note to the ""Official"" Amazon reviewer: It's very well demonstrated (both visually and audibly) that the reason the family and farm hands are using the silk-like wings in the vineyard is to try to distribute the heat from the fires burning in the cans down to the grape vines (not to chase away insects, as you wrote). There is a frost warning for that night, and that's why everyone scrambles to get the heat down to the grapes. Frost + grapes = bad wine, I guess. This movie is probably in my top 20."
5,One of the Best Romantic Movies of All Time :),"I love this movie! It's one of my all-time favorite romances :)Keanu Reeves is brilliant-softhearted, vulnerable, charming and handsome-and his female counterpart is a really good actress too. The landscapes are really marvellous. I highly recommend this movie to anyone."
4,all is well,"I bought 2 of the movie a walk in the clouds and both were in good condition. I was especially pleased with 1 of them more than the other due to the condition of the case. Interestinly enough, they were slightly different covers as well. The movies arrived in a timely manner and were well packaged to ensure safe arrival of product through the mail. Overall no complaints here."
5,A Timeless Romantic Tale,"The best romantic movies slowly bring you in until you feel as though you are part of the family. A Walk In the Clouds does just that, and an amazing family it is. The story is of young GI Keanue Reeves who has returned from war disillusioned by what he finds yet determined to go on with his life. He meets a young, unmarried, and pregnant girl on the train and the story begins. Its a story of romance and family traditions. The stunning background make it easy to become swept up in the story of two who want each other so bad yet feel like they can't be together due to lies and rules. Love is bound to find a way in a tale that quickly encompasses your heart."
4,Old Folks Enjoyment (For those who remember the end of WW II.),My wife and I watched this moview several years ago and enjoyed it a second time even though the acting is a little slow. But we both remember the end of WWII and all the soldiers returning home to find what they left behind had changed including wives and sweethearts. Some of the men had been gone for 5 years and during that time kids had been born and lives changed forever. It's too bad that so many people today don't pay the respect to these gallant men that they deserve.
5,One of my favorite romances,"A touching romance. I am not a huge Keanu Reeves fan, but this story is sweet. It is the perfect romance to watch while curled up on the couch with someone special. A crackling fire burning in the back ground is a must. It is the story of a returning war veteran who married, in a rush, before the war. He sets out as a traveling chocolates salesman and ends up trying to rescuing the virture of a girl in trouble, but falls in love."
5,A Walk in the Clouds,I have watched this movie several times before I purchased it. Liked it so much I wanted to be able to watch it whenever I pleased.
3,"Wholesome, romantic, beautiful - A MUST SEE!!","This movie was truly a labor of love. Very romantic, wholesome. Reflects a family at odds with tradition and modernism. Keanu portrayed a character whose actions we admire. Great job, sweetie!! :)"
4,~You wouldn't be sorry if you give this movie a chance~,"If you have just one ounce of romance in your heart, you might love this movie. It's like a fairy tale that steps up to steal you away to a beautiful place in the Napa Valley and introduces you into the life of beautiful Hispanic woman, Victoria and her very traditional Hispanic family. There are no outstanding acting performances although it is enjoyable to see Anthony Quinn act the role of an old, and very clever grandfather, even in his old age. The visual effects, i.e the ""grape stomping"" and the evening when the vineyard is saved from the threat of a frost (the workers and the family have to work together to save the grape vines), these things just have a way of letting you get totally caught up in the story."
2,Coming Attractions Drew Me In,"I saw the trailer for this Keanu Reeve movie, and it looked very appealing, so much so that I lept at the opportunity to see it when it finally hit the theatres. Ah, such disappointments are not rare enough, sorry to say.This was my first Keanu, and I believe it shall be my last. I think he might make a very good Curious George, but he's not a good leading man at all. Anthony Quinn at 80 is more attractive than this whippersnapper will ever be.Other parts of the movie are not so bad, so if you want to go for a stroll, take ""A Walk in the Clouds"", but you won't bump into anything like an excellent movie while you're up there."
1,A GREAT OLD FASHION FILM BUT WHO NEEDS BLU RAY?,"I would love to hear on all movies that are also on blu ray a seperate review and whythat movie should be bought on ""BLU RAY""I give ONE star to the film being a wonderful, beautiful, old fashion movie that I loved.But zero to ""Blu Ray."" Why pay for what seems like mostly new packaging, based onproduct information. ""Blu Ray"" didn't seem to take the time to restore the picturebut this disk offers NO OTHER FEATURES. Not even one in the ""making of the film.""So why waste your money and buy it? What are you getting...simply a better lookingpicture but unless your HDTV is at least 60 inches you won't enjoy the difference.""Blu Ray"" is getting lazy. Save your money and buy the regular DVD on this one."
2,Very Disappointed,I ordered this for my 84 year old dad and he very much wanted to see this movie in Spanish. When he received it he could not view it because it stated that there was a region error. We returned it and have been told that he would see a credit on his account. We shall see. I don't understand why the company did not offer to send one that would be able to be viewed.
4,I love this movie,"Like the title suggests, this movie takes you to another time and another place. It is wonderfully romantic without being corny. I like the visual aspect and the pace of this movie. Aitana sánchez gijón gives an amazing performance. In fact I think she is the embodiment of the romance genre. I purchase the DVD a few years ago and will purchase the Blu Ray when it comes out. Totally enjoyed it."
4,old fashioned love story,"First Keanu Reeves, have to like him to like the movie (which I do). Then a beautiful setting, a good love story with beautiful old fashioned values and sweetness. Great comedy. Forgive the ending which was way overdone and enjoy the movie for what we don't get to see enough of, good romance."
4,Give It a Chance,"I'm not a Keanu Fan and did not want to see this movie, but my girlfriend finally won out. I watched this movie and was pleasantly surprised. Think ""Fools Rush In"" but on a more serious note. The movie takes place on a winery (which is probably why I liked it) with knowledge grandparents and a likable character played by Keanu this movie may be better then you expect it to be. It at least deserves a chance."
4,Si me llamas amor,"This is one of my favorite movies, and it is not because of Keanu Reeves. The story line is a somewhat cheezy, yet charming, tale of post-war romance where Keanu's character battles with the choices he's made before the war, and the opportunities he finds when he returns -- and meets a woman. Out of kindness to the new woman he has met (who is not his wife! yes, he married before the war), he encounters new battles as he lies to help her out of a potentially bad situation, only to find that he is quickly caught up in a family ordeal (and a personal battle of integrity in regards to his own marriage). Without giving too much away, the movie is cute and romantic, as Keanu serenades her with ""amor, si me llamas amor!"" (one of my favorite parts :) ...) and finds out what it really is to have love and a family."
4,a present,"I hope she likes it, it was a present so it has not been opened yet. Christmas morning is still coming."
2,"Great scenery, if nothing else","Predictable and shallow plot, some good acting by Anthony Quinn, but not much else. I'm glad I rented this and didn't buy it. Kenau Reeves isn't much of an actor anyway and the script of this picture didn't help him out much. The settings were beautiful, but some of the scenes were very unrealistic, even by ""romantic comedy"" standards, i.e. the fire in the vineyard. Unless your a fan of wine country flicks, give this one a pass."
2,Flip Flops,This video tape flip flops all the way through. It is not our VCR because it plays other videos perfect. There is definitely something wrong with this video tape.
5,75 Readings Plus review,I am very happy with my purchase of 75 Readings Plus. It arrived quickly and was brand new!I would recommend this sender.
1,wrong item,"I had the biggest hassle with this order. After ordering the book 3 times I received the right book by getting a brand new one direct from amazon. I needed the 9th edition, which you advertised but did not deliver."
4,Awesome book for your course,The title says it all. This book had pertinent information related to the course I was taking.
1,No sound!!,And no it's not the DVD player...everything else works fine on it. This is the second time this happened with Amazon. The first time was a real hassle since the replacement had no sound either..grrrrr! Not a big jazz fan but LOVE Monks music. I really wanted to see AND hear him play.
2,Almost boring,"I love jazz, love documentaries, did NOT love this film. Sorry. It lacked editing and any real information. Skip it."
5,A must for Monk fans,"If you love Monk's recordings you can't afford not to own this. Here is Monk performing many of his classics in a variety of settings in addition to a very well edited documentary. The non-performance clips do much to shed light on Monk's personality and includes interviews with Charlie Rouse and T. Monk Jr. I thought the sections with his son , while brief, were very touching and revealing of the private struggles that Monk went through.This may not have as much appeal to those who are unfamiliar with the mans' musical contributions but it is a fine film and a wonderful tribute to a true giant."
5,A beautiful black and white view of Americian Jazz,"This film contains some very rare footage of John Coltrain on stage with Monk in New York(mid/late 50's). Coltrain, is so junked out that only after Monk ends the set and gets up from the piano to walk away, does Coltrain, open his eyes, remove the horn from his mouth, look around and follows the band off the stage. Also a great stage rehearsal in Europe with a young Phil Woods in the band. And of Monk in the studio chewing out the producer of the recording session, Teo Macero, for not turning on the tape machine when the band did a take. This is a great movie about a great American composer, who just so happened to live in our time. And lucky for us somebody decided to point a movie camera at that man, and turn it on."
4,Monk,"Done with class, Clint has done it again. It even has spot shot of Rasham Rollin Kirk. Nice Documentary"
5,The greatest jazz film ever made. (Bar NONE),"Three cheers for Clint Eastwood for having the courage and fortitude to produce such a film as this. He recognized the genius of Monk and set out to film him in his element at a time when very few American film makers, record companies and the public at large had very little if any interest in Monk. The most remarkable thing about this film is that there is no narrator to put his/her slanted and narrow opinions and interpretations in and take reality out. There is no Denzel Washington nor Wesley Snipes to portray characters. No Quincy Jones or Spike Lee to explain the idiom. One can see and hear the voices of the actual musicians themselves in the process of living and creating music. Mr. Eastwood captured these realities at the beginning of Monk's decline and on to the end. The only film that comes close to this is Mingus ""Beneath The Underdog"". There is a lot of truth in this film, something that the American public seldom appreciates."
4,When musicians really cared about the music,"This is the DVD I would give to all my friends who scattter when I go to play a Monk CD, saying ""I just don't understand that music."" Hopefully the glimpse it provides into the life of a genius and superb musician, the regard others had for him, and the respect he demanded for his art, hearing from him, and hearing and seeing him play that piano will spur them to want to hear more. I rarely peer into the lives of musicians I love, but I am glad to have looked closer at Thelonius Monk. His was of the era when the music itself was what really mattered to the artists who created it, and Monk was champion at that."
3,"Disappointing, I regret to say...","I am a huge fan of Monk's music, but the footage used in this documentary came toward the end of his performing career, and Monk comes off as inarticulate and strange. The songs are great, but sound better of course on his CD's. The consensus seems to be that Thelonius was a manic-depressive, (now called bipolar disorder) although those actual terms are not used in the comments by his adult son or his former agent or bandmates. Something was wrong, however, with his mood control and his grasp on reality in his later years. I suppose this product is better than having no film at all of such a fascinating artist, but the 90 minutes really does not educate us much as to how and why TM created his jazz piano compositions or choose to play in such a unique style. I had high expectations before I sat down to view this film, and found myself getting bored halfway through. I suggest letting his recordings speak for him, instead of these film clips."
5,A great introduction to the Silent Film genre.,"I am so glad that Da Capo put this old Oxford University Press book back in print. I had read it back when I was a teenager in Chandler, Arizona and found its descriptions of these elusive films fascinating. For instance, this book was the first place I had heard of FW Murnau's excellent Sunrise, which is now a favorite of mine. Get this book for your private Silent Film Genre Reference Library."
3,"Keep the map, leave the book at home","You'll need at least one or two other guides if you're going to Costa Rica for the first time. This book directs you to spend most of your time at the major resorts. That's great for anyone with unlimited funds but the rest of us have to be a little more realistic. One the up side, the map was great."
2,"Ok, but..","This cologne is just ok because the smell is very generic. There are at least 25 colognes with a similar clean scent. The problem with this product also lies with it's price. This cologne is way overpriced for what it is. There are far better scents available for the same price, or up to $5 more. Even Cool Water which is far above this product, costs less. The people at Clinique are known for their skin products which are top-notch. But in the cologne market, they are not competitively priced to sell a lot of this scent. They probably don't care because their meat and potatoes are the skin products they sell. But if you're going to spend this much on a clean scent, you'd be better off trying R DeCappucci, Vetiver, Aqua Di Silva, Gendarme, or Terre D'Hermes. There are MANY others as well."
5,Smells Great,Stupid name but great cologne. It's fresh and clean. I've already gone through my first bottle and will definitely buy another right away.
5,HAPPY CLINIQUE,Best of all is this ... I recommend it 200% is my favorite scent of mandarin citrus very espescial ... arrived in good condition
3,So So Cologne,"I bought this based off the many 5 star reviews and, I have to admit, I'm a little disappointed. First, let me say that the fragrance itself is not repulsive or too feminine. It does have a orange/citrus scent, not at all unpleasant. It just isn't what I (and my wife) like. Also, the scent does not seem to last as long as I would like/expect.I think I've learned my lesson on purchasing cologne off the Internet when I haven't tested it in person prior. Also, this cologne may be just perfect for someone else - it just doesn't suit my taste."
4,get up and move your [bottom] fefeelefeel it your but.....,"if asked what vein this this album would fall in... actually if you ever cared for anything from Wax Trax's industrial dance 12'' a fan of Clock DVA, Nurse w/ Wound or better yet the closest I'd say it is right where the COIL album Loves Secret Domain was At times true genius, at times very very much an album that is sexual and grindy so much so you almost can smell it and of course it also takes a very dark psycho sexual realm that is very much an lp I have always been able to play for anyone irregardless of their tastes (assuming they do have taste) and like myself was hooked on it although it must be given a few listens to do so butt is so worthy and should be in anyones collection if you are a fan of the industrial genre IT IS on my Deserted island disks top 10"
3,I'm just a voice,"On paper, this sounds like a great idea, and indeed ""Anthem"" and ""Ballad"" fulfill this collaboration's potential. A few of the tracks (""Man Should Surrender"" especially) have not aged so well. They have a clinical industrial feel that could have benefitted from a more organic approach.From a purely political point of view, though, ""Trait"" is still right on the money."
3,OK,"These shoes were not nearly as cushioned as I expected... the price was really good and the company was excellent, just not a good shoe for those looking for comfort."
2,Jackie's first american movie,"Jackie's first attempt to break into the American market, his english is not the best in this movie. The action is horrid- very slow and choppy- not the typical action you'd expect from Jackie. Clearly, the American director and stunt choreographers were not familiar with Jackie's abilities and style, and the film suffers because of it. Well, that and the fact that the plot is really flat and stupid. It is fun to watch Jackie on roller skates, though, and if you are a huge fan this movie is worth at least one viewing."
3,"Dissapointing, but still worth a watch.","Battle Creek brawl, Chan's first attempt to break into American markets, was not a success, and it's not hard to see why. Jackie had no control over the fight choreography, so the fights were very stiff and slow. Having said this there are some good acrobatics preformed by Jackie (watch out for his three point kick) and some cool moves (like at the beginning with the metal bars high above the ground, watch it and see). An average movie by Jackie's standards."
1,HORRIBLE,"Worst jackie chan movie ever. I am huge Jackie Chan fan and have seen about 50 of his movies, this has to be about the worst. I could not even finish wathing this movie it was so bad."
4,The Big Brawl or Battle Creek Brawl,"I have seen this film twice, once state side (I think it was 1979), and once while I was in the Philipines (in 1981). I don't remeber which name I view where, but it was the same great flick, and nether one had subtitles.Being a fan of ""Choppie Sockie"" flicks, this was not the first film I have seen Jackie Chan in. Among the other flicks I had seen Jackie in, I knew him as one of the many Bruce Lee imitators that poped-up after Burce died, but this flick showed some talents I had not yet witnessed. Jackie's natural athletic abilities and willingness to try something different made this film vary enjoyable! In those Kung Fu Crazed days, this film was a plesent change from the revenge story lines that were the norm. In fact there are vary few orentals in this movie, which makes this an unusal movie for it's day.I highly recomend this movie! Unfortunately I'm still looking for a copy in english."
3,Great fights and stunts - but in Chinese!,"This movie was one of Jackie Chan's first, released in the USA in 1980 as ""The Big Brawl."" It has a mostly American cast and was filmed in English. Unfortunately, this version is dubbed in Chinese and subtitled in Japanese and English. The English subtitles are so low on the screen as to be invisible most of the time. Also, some of the pan and scan to format the film for TV is quite bad. BUT - the fight scenes and acrobatics are among the best of any Jackie Chan movie. The plot is simple: 1920s Chicago gangsters blackmail Jackie into fighting in a brawl so they can bet on him. Forget the dialog and enjoy the action. If we buy enough copies of this, maybe they'll release the original English version."
3,chan fans will be dissopointed,"if you dont know jackie chan and you watch this it will seem cool. But, if you know chan like me this is a real dissapointment."
3,An amusing 1950s British comedy.,"A good cast with many familiar faces provides quite a few laughs--including several repeat visual ""gags"". The basic concept requires a bit of ""suspension of disbelief"" but with that in mind it is a light but enjoyable film. Doctor Who fans in particular will find this early glimpse of the comedic talent of Jon Pertwee (who became the 3rd Doctor 20 years later) particularly entertaining."
5,A Masterpiece Comes to Video,"Once in a while a movie comes along that is an instant classic. One that can transcend ideas and long-held notions. It has the power to move a viewer, and change one's mind forever. This is that type of film. This incredible video about the life of two professional women who surpassed the 100-year mark is a masterpiece. Based on the book by the Delaney Sisters, this video beautifully and vividly brings to life the amazing story of a loving family and their adventures in life. All the characters were sensitively and accurately portrayed, however, a standout performance is given by Broadway star Audra MacDonald as the young Bessie Delaney. Ms. MacDonald's performance is superlative; every emotion is felt and the audience gets the opportunity to live in the character's shoes, thanks to this amazing performer's portrayal. Invite the family, your friends, your neighbors for a viewing. This is a must-see. Don't miss it."
3,Not So Hot,"I honestly didn't like the sound of the recipes.... With the exception of the ""chile-toasted coconut strips"" there was nothing that I wanted to eat.I also didn't like the fact that many of the ""Hot Tips"" were not legible due to the graphics. I also like to have a few photos of what a prepared dish looks like.There are much better Mexican (which really this isn't) cookbooks out there.However, if you like to cook with different types of chiles, and you want something different, then this is the book for you."
4,The energy these two possess follows into their book,to read a complete review about this book or many other books available through Amazon books please check out the reviews at http://www.chefolder.co
4,"Great compilation, but with some edited versions","Hold on to your old WaxTrax CDs: several tracks on this CD are shorter than the versions on the Kooler Than Jesus EP and Cuz It's Hot single. This is still a great compilation: the sound quality is great, and the bonus tracks are nothing less than decent. But if you want the full-length versions, you'll still need the older CDs."
5,This recording should be required buying for all horn fans,Incredible horn playing and a nice collection of lesser know works for horn.
5,Outstanding,"I was thrilled with this book. All Laurie Anderson fans should get this.. From those that discovered her in the 70's to those who came on board with ""O Superman"" or ""home of the brave"" and subsequent projects, its got it all (mostly). Beatufilly rendered photos, and text..i can't give it 6 stars?"
5,Thanks,Bought These for my Kawasaki Ninja 250. Brakes work much better than what were on it before. Great stopping power now.
2,Too tough for younger kids,I bought this for my 5 & 7 year old sons. The graphics do look great but it is too tough for them to play. They got frustrated very quickly with the puzzle like play. I think this game would be great for preteens.
2,Not easy...,"I bought this game for my daughter because she simply adored Monsters Inc and really loved the first playstation game. But even though it's rated E, it's a pretty hard game for smaller kids. My daughter is six and it frustrated her to no end. She didn't know what she was supposed to do, and when she finally figured that part out she didn't know how to go do it. I really wished I had rented it first instead of blowing 40 bucks on something she played for a total of 20 minutes. My advice for parents: rent it before you buy it, especially if you're buying with younger children in mind."
2,Not for everyone!!,I run a daycare and my kids love the Monster Inc. movie but this game is to hard for them. It is rated everyone but there is to much reading and it does not hold their interest. I am sorry that I wasted $... on this!
1,lame,"My 5 year old and I got this game ... we were both dissapointed and bored after an hour. A weak entry in the platform genre, the only attractive quality is the characters and the movie clips. Some levels are tedious, hard to discern what you're looking at because of lighting/shading, and none are terribly original or fun..."
2,This game ...!,"I loved the movie of Monster's, Inc. but frankly I think this game really ...! The only reason why I gave it 2 stars was because of the DVD features (movie clips, trailer, behind-the-scenes footage). I only recommend this game to people who have the time to play and can get past the first level. NOT WORTH THE [money] TO PLAY IT! This is a better rent than buy."
4,Looks Like A Great Game!,"I haven't played it yet but this game looks awsome. I love the Monsters,Inc. movie and the video game for PS2 should be awsome."
4,Love it,"A very good introduction to the Silk Roads. This book was thoroughly written and contains everything I ever wanted to know about the Silk Roads. It is a very engaging read. The only downside is that sources are not cited, and there are many snippets of information which could not be verified by outside sources."
5,Ms. Covington covers a lot,"Yes a woman named Lee wrote this book. She was on the radio talking about it. I had thought it was a man. My ignorance. I am the first to admit that divorce is horrible but sometimes necessary. Ask any loving man that has a self absorbed wife. Men get the short end of the stick in divorce and this is the one book you will find that addresses how you can get out with more than just the shirt on your back which she (and I mean her lawyer not her) will still try to get. The main thing is planning. If you plan ahead you will make divorce as painless for you as possible. If you are a woman reading this and think god how could someone write about this, take a look at the number of books written on the reverse side that show how to squeeze a man until he cries like a choir boy. Ms. Covington does say that you may have to pay and in some cases you should pay but the lawyers are the ones that will pressure your dear wife to nail you for everything."
1,Pretty insulting,There can be some practical advice in there but I had a hard time getting to it because it just seemed to be based on deceit.
1,Impractical Advice for a Man Trapped in an Unhappy Marriage,"It seems to me that this book appeals to the most selfish sort of husband or girl friend. It is too bad that a person who would agree with the things said in this book would be very unlikely to become more happy after following the advice given. Unless a person learns to be less selfish, I am quite sure a man will discover that the perfect girl friend, who has now become the perfect wife, will in no time turn into what the author calls Wife One, Wife Two or Wife Three, which are three stereotypical kinds of problem wives. Likewise, the man who remains single with his piles of hidden money bags is unlikely to find a bit of happiness until he can learn about truth and justice. It's not a pleasant world for the man who must suspect every person of being just as dishonest and inequitable as he has been."
1,Be aware of what you're buying,"This publication is only Volume IV of the four volume work. The table of contents shown when you click LOOK INSIDE must be excerpted from some other complete edition. If Volume IV is all you're looking for and you like the price, order this book. Otherwise, spare yourself the trouble of having to return it when it arrives and disappoints your expectations (as it did mine)."
5,a portable library,ES is a titanic reference work of inestimable value to students and scholars of Renaissance and Shakespearean drama. One can simply flip through it and every few pages find sufficient historical and documentary material on which to base an entire academic article. Indispensable.
5,"Love the pattern,,,, But",Love this pattern but when I originally bought it from Oneida it was suppose to be a pattern that was never to end if a piece was lost. Well guess what within my period of owning this pattern it was discontinued leaving me to buy extra pieces from where I could find them. Learning from my mistakes or others.
5,LOVE IT,I love it. I used it today and it was everything I wanted it to be. My hair was slicker and smoother.
3,I've had better..,"I ordered this conditioner as well as the shampoo. I don't really see a major improvement in hair breakage or shine. I notice my hair seems frizzy though (which it usually isn't). Recently however, I added some Jojoba Oil I ordered from Coastal Scents to this shampoo and conditioner giving it a more liquid consistency but now I get that shine and softness I was looking for. Washing my hair now feels like more of a moisturizing process rather than the stripping of the natural oils from my hair. I probably won't repurchase this conditioner though just because I've tried an organic drugstore conditioner that has worked much better than this. I need the extra moisture for my dry, damaged hair and this is a light conditioner so it would probably work better for people who don't need much moisture."
5,Mill Creek Conditioner,"This conditoner has transformed my hair. I'm a curly natural girl, so what I put in my hair is very important. This is my third purchase of Mill Creek conditioner."
1,Mill Creek Keratin Conditioner,"This stuff is awful, it is way too runny. It's not moisturizing, nor does it have a pleasing smell. I bought a good amount of Mill Creek products and was sorely disappointed in most of them."
1,Dont waste your money here!,"I bought this conditioner and after trying it just once I know that I do not want to use it again. It's not conditioning at all. My hair seemed drier after using it and the scent is very strong (nausiating) almost. It says on the bottle its got organic and natural ingredients, well, o.k. maybe a few of the items are organic but not all of it if you read the long list. Dont be fooled. I'll stick to my old favorite (suave) because it's more nourishing than this stuff and it's cheaper. Dont waste your money trying it."
1,Keratin I don't know?,"It's very watery, I don't think it's real keratin conditioner. I have used other keratin conditioner before and they worked so well but this one yeah not so much!!"
3,good buy,I actually didn't like this conditioner too much but the shampoo is great at clarifying my natural hair. the conditioner didn't put enough moisture back in my hair after using the shampoo. ended up throwing the half empty bottle away :(
4,"Strong vocalist, good musicians","A great album, better than their most recent. Great to listen to beginning to end, while rummaging through the house or on a long drive. The lead vocalist is an awesome tenor."
4,Strong sound.,"This is another album that I bought on a whim, primarily from hearing the tune ""Munich"" on the radio. I ended up loving the whole album. Very strong. One could probably say that the band's sound is a hybrid of U2, The Doors, and some others. I think their sound is compelling. The more I listen to this album, the more I like it."
3,Not ready for foreground,"A noticeable but impersonal indie rock debut owing solely to the Interpol-led, current JD wave of derivatives, supplies solid songs that runs course and then exits from memory."
5,People are fragile . . .,"Interpol are good but Editors are *great*. Their songs tug at my heart and make me want to cry for loves lost in the past - I don't know why but something about this album catches me in my throat and I feel the tears begin to prick behind my eyelids. I was once fantastically in love with a man who introduced me to the Chameleons - I suppose that Editors is the closest I have heard to the type of music that anchors me to that particularly strong emotion. I can't describe this album with the words that it deserves - please listen to it and don't compare it to anyone else; if you know Interpol already, Editors may be too 'samey' to you. If you like Editors and want some more (slightly second rate) of the same, try Interpol. Either way, enjoy."
5,80's goth-pop revival,"This is a phenomenal CD, which I would definitely recommned to al those who grew up during the 1980's post-punk era. The Editors combine the raw angular guitars of early Echo and the Bunnymen and Psychedelic Furs, the goth doom-and-gloom voices and sounds of Joy Division (and present-day bands like Interpol) and some of the pop sounds of U2 and Tears for Fears. This is the best debut album of 2005, by far."
2,Doesn't Live Up to the Hype,"This band keeps getting compared to Interpol and sometimes the Killers when really, aside from the fact that they seem to have ripped some of their songs beat by beat, they are nowhere near as successful as those other bands in their delivery! The song Munich (one which I'd associate the most with Interpol) does have a catchy hook, but the rest of the album fails to capture the same magic. I hope they continue exploring their sound and I wish them well, but as things stand, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend it. It's just not one of those albums that you can play all the way through and without skipping over some songs (like you can 'Turn on the Bright Lights' or 'Hot Fuss').Ultimately, one gets the feeling that they are just trying to cash in on the current trend in music and creating forgettable material in the process."
4,Idlewild?,Excellent.. but it is not Joy Division (apart from the Peter Hook bass) it is Idlewild. It's so obvious... isn't it?
1,"Uh, the Editors ""kinda"" sound like Interpol?","The first time I played this CD I actually pulled it out of the player and looked at it. This band isn't ""in the style of"" Interpol, or ""influenced"" by Interpol -- this is an IMPRESSION. This is an IMITATION. In twenty years when you see Interpol tribute bands playing your local saloon, they'll only wish they sounded as much like Interpol as the Editors.Personally, I wouldn't listen to this CD twice. First, mediocre Interpol isn't that good -- as their second album shows. Second, a band needs an identity, and not one taken from another group."
1,click EDIT>select ALL>DELETE!,"If I wanted to listen to Interpol-I would. So what if they're British. I'm Texan. How does this fact make these schmucks better than American bands creating that ""brit-rock"" sound? That's right it doesn't. Now I'm not defending bands like The Bravery or The Killers (I am defending Interpol) but at least these guys jumped on the band wagen at least two years ago. Where were the ""Editors"" in 2002? Still struggling? Interpol had their debut out way before the ""Editors"". Just because this Tom Smith putz has an accent people are flocking to him. Fine. Slap an accent on Paul Banks and call it a day. The fact is ""Antics"", Interpol's weakest album (but still freakin' brilliant) surpasses anything from ""The Back Room""."
4,Very solid,This is a serious piece of metal for your more powerful routers. It fits tightly into the slot and doesn't move at all. I am only giving 4/5 stars because it mounted my freud router at a strange angle which required me to remove one of the handles on the router to keep it away from the angle adjustment handle of my table saw (I have the cast iron router wing for table saws). Next time I will just get an undrilled one so that I can choose what angle I want it at.
4,An oldie...,"For its time, this was THE book to have if you wanted to climb at Great Falls. It was the most comprehensive book on the market (heck, it was the ONLY book on the market!) for climbing at Great Falls. Jim Eakin had done a fabulous job of compiling all the route information to the area into a nice, small, pocket-sized book. Back in its day, this was a 5-star book. However...It has become obsolete. In 2001 it was superceded by a second edition assembled by Alex Tait. The new edition included more climbs, more photos, more topos, and better maps (the ones in the first edition were already quite good). So if you pick up the first edition of this book, it'll be mostly for nostalgia (the route information isn't totally obsolete, but the new book does have more routes, and updates on some routes which are now closed for climbing). The second edition is a 5-star book."
1,Barrier-Breaking Resumes And Interviews,"Here is the first paragraph of the Introduction verbatim: ""Barrier-Breaking Resumes And Interviews is not an ordinary how-to-find-a-job book. This book is for those who have little or no work experience, have just been released from jail, or were formerly on public assistance."" With 20 years of work experience, I found this book useless to me, but it may be good for you if you have very little or no work experience."
1,This is just an interview with a energy healer,"If you are looking for practices or exercises to learn how to raise your own kundalini energy then this video is not for you. Basically this video is an interview of an energy healer, about how he got interested in energy healing and stories of how he has healed people. I wish they would have put a trailer or something of the video to give you an idea of what the video is about...instead of a small vague description. The description they had was rather misleading in making you think this is a self-help video when it really isn't. I wish I could get my $8 back."
2,Book arrived after the class finish using it!!,Very disappointed to wait for this book after the class finish discussing it!! So I had to return it and got deducted about $3 for shipping fee..
5,Absolutely fantastic!,"I've always dreamed of driving a single ox. Thanks to this book, now I own one. He's an apprentice ox to be sure (Aiah is a 7 month old Holstein-Jersey) but thanks to the clear instructions in this marvelous book, he's coming along just fine. Now, following the directions in the yoke-making chapter (aided by a single yoke leaflet from Tillers International), I'm building Aiah's first yoke. If you've ever considered owning oxen but don't know where to begin--BUY THIS BOOK. You'll be very, very glad you did."
5,Teamster Guide,I bought Oxen: A Teamster's Guide for my father and he loved it. My father is 85 and has always lived on a farm. After he retired from his day job he continued to farm but eventually had to sell off his herd of Jerseys. He has kept a pair of oxen and this book had great stories that he really enjoyed.
2,I fell asleep watching it!,This movie is boring! It made me go to sleep! Not a normal thing for me while I am watching Jackie Chan movies!!!
2,squeek? eek,it does spin easily and one of the cats liked it but it is small and lightweight that when he gets his paw in there the whole toy moves along the floor.also the squeek does not work

5,"Wild, Wild Planet","I remember seeing this film at a movie theater when I was a kid. Seeing it again as an adult, I foung the story is unbelievable even for science fiction, and the set/props appear as though they were made by an 8 year old. All this aside, I still love the movie. I seen many movies when I was young, but for some strange reason this one always stood out in my memory. When I discovered it was released on DVD, I knew I had to have it."
2,"I would go 4 stars,but Stormy Temp.brings it way down","Wild Wild is one of those 60s si fi movies with horrable acting,horrable script,and I love it.The only thing I will give away about the movie,is the name calling,the first one was,You space idiot,no good,it did not stick.Then came Look Helium Head.we had a winner,they all got to use that one.If this review was for just this movie,I wd,go 5 stars,just for the memories,and joy it is to watch.NOW>The worst P.O.C.movie ever Stormy Tempest,I will bet anything this movie was funded by the Geek who got to kiss the big footed amazon.He had to pay her,and when you see this guy you will know this was prob.his first and last kiss,and to quote Velvet Jones...""My honor!Da bitch ugly.""and the movie should never have been anything but a home movie at best."
5,Beautiful set,"Crackle Effect 6 Pcs Japanese Sushi Plate Set (Aqua)I gave this set as a gift and received many compliments. It's beautiful, and the packaging makes it a really nice gift. A high quality product. Great value for the money."
1,buyer beware!,I ordered this recently as a holiday gift. I was extremely disappointed when I received the item from seller Lucca. It arrived in a USPS shoe box wrapped in newspaper. The description (which has since been changed) said it came in a gift box and many of the reviewers prior to my order mentioned that the packaging was cute and made for a nice gift. I have contacted the seller twice and have not received a reply.
5,Awesome!,"This was a gift, its something different but so pretty and sturdy. Recipient was extremely satisfied!"
1,Forked Forks,I ordered the 5-piece place setting and love the pattern but the salad for and the dinner fork both had bent tines. I was able to straighten them out (somewhat) but was disappointed that the product wasn't perfect with the price that was paid. I did not contact the company since I was able to bend the tines back in place. They might have replaced them for all I know. I usually don't complain about anything and I hate to even put a negative remark out here but felt I needed to.
3,High Intensity,"""A Team Boot Camp"" is one of those workouts where you collapse at the end and can't believe you actually made it through such a tough set of exercises. This is definitely an advanced workout that will make you sweat and test your endurance. You do need quite a few things like a stability ball, 3- and 5-pound weights, a weighted bar, a mat and a step. I used my Transformer step and it was fine. Most of the exercises can be modified if you are intermediate like me. If you've been doing workouts for years it will be very easy for you to figure out how to make some of the more high-impact exercises into low-impact exercises. By using weights in this workout you can target your upper and lower body. There are six aerobic intervals each followed by a toning section. If you are advanced you are going to love the challenges. If you are intermediate you will have fun being creative. If you are a beginner - run! This is too intense and moves at too fast a pace!~The Rebecca Review"
5,Lovely music,"Great tunes of simple beauty, several tracks play in my head for hours after I have heard them. A must have for your collection."
2,only half book,"its look like its only half of the book ""with fire and sword"", it is probably my mistake' i thought that the 1st volume of the trilogy contained thewhole book.the other parts are ""THE DELUGE"" AND ""PAN VOLODIOVSKY"". wwhat i am asking is how do i can have the other parts of this book,(part three and four) i would appreciate very much your attention to it. yours faithfully, daniel"
5,"Takes effort, but so worth it.","This is the third book in C. S. Lewis's science fiction trilogy. These books get progressivley more detailed, theological, ""heady"" as the series goes on. I think I would say that this is my favorite of the three, perhaps because it sums up the story of Elwin Ransom that was started in ""Out of the Silent Planet"", or perhaps because it is just plain the weirdest out of the three. It has a rather gory ending, which is not to my personal taste, but the story ends very satisfactorily. I totally recommend the whole series, but this book especially is not for children. Also, it is not ""light"" reading, and takes some concentration and perseverance. Absolutely worth reading, if you like this genre and/or author. I would also receommend reading the three books in order."
2,Worst of the series,"This is the worst (and final) book of Lewis' space trilogy. Here, his apparent lack of forethought and organization culminate in ""That Hideous Strength"" where Lewis seems to drift aimlessly among topics of space travel and other worlds, to British monarchistic nationalism, Arthurian legends, angelology, human psychology, reincarnation, mad scientists, and marriage life.In short, while I enjoyed ""Out of the Silent Planet"" and gained some pleasure from Perelandra, this final book was a horrible amalgamation of aimless themes, lacked a concise plot, and left the reader (at least this reader) disappointed."
3,strength,"to long a time lapsed from ordering the book to when i actully recd it, on january 8th 2008. checked online, and this product was sent to phoenix arizona, where it sat for at least a week. poor quality control as far as tracking the shipping."
4,a true classic,"I enjoyed the book, although I can't call it an easy read. The persistence required to read it reminded me of reading ""Atlas Shrugged"". Time was needed between courses to digest what was presented and to appreciate what was next. I would think that one who would read this book would get a different message depending on what their experiences are to date, although this is true for many books, ""That hideous strength"" is in an elite category. I think it will be a different book the next time I read it.As for the message, I will not go and bore the reader with my impression. Written over 60 years ago, much like ""Atlas Shrugged"" the message is transcending and also much like Rand's masterpiece, I'll read it many times."
4,"Very, very Lewis","As a story, That Hideous Strength is of a lesser calibre than Out of the Silent Planet or Perelandra, the other books in the Cosmic Trilogy. As an allogory and as an exploration of ultimate Truth, however, That Hideous Strength is a wonderful book; it is theology dressed up as a story and, so long as one acknowledges this, it is a deeply satisfying book"
5,2nd best fiction ever written!,"This is my 2nd favorite fiction ever, right after Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. ""Hideous"" is brilliant because it combines a pragmatic look at evil people and diabolical conspiracies with a wit and humor that keeps me laughing on almost every page.And in classic Lewis style, interwoven everywhere are religious allegories and symbolism. This book is a treat, like a creamsicle on a summer afternoon.I was confused at the beginning since the story seems to suddenly break from the 1st two in the trilogy, both in storyline, and in the fact that there seems to be no science fiction in Hideous. But everything becomes clear later on, and the trilogy is truly continued.This may become known as the most undiscovered book of the 20th century, but it's a classic and a literary jewel."
5,An twisting plot that keeps the pages turning.,"I truly loved That Hideous Strength. I have read both of it's prequels and I was not diasapointed by the final book. The plot kept me reading, the characters kept me interested, and the ending left me with a smile."
5,Excellent! Will be read for centuries to come!,"This book is a must read for all C.S. Lewis fans, or even fiction or sci-fi fans. Lewis does a better job of potraying a battle of angels and devils then Frank Paretti did in This Present Darkness. This book lets the reader see the eternal conflict between good and evil. Satan and God.Lewis does a remarkable job in this extraordinary book! For all Christians (and sci-fi or fiction fans), this is a must read!!"
1,Very slow read,I didnt like it. I couldnt get past the first chapter. Should get a refund. It moves way too slow and does not really continue from book 2
3,A very strange title for a book.,"The third book was a disappointment. I was expecting something completely different. The first part of the book was introducing people who weren't in the first two books and I had a hard time following who was who and how they fit in with the folks in the other two books. I wasn't able to figure out who this odd character was with the bleeding foot or if he was a main character or not until he was called by another name somewhere in the middle of the book. But I am sure the folks that like mysteries, would figure this out rather quickly. Anyway, this was not my style of book."
3,Strong start,"For the first half, at least, it is an absorbing look at the lure of power and the ever-unfolding ""Inner Ring"" (see that essay in the Weight of Glory compilation). Wither in particular is a chilling entity, one of the great characterizations. The novel lost me later on when it explained too much about Belbury, and then simultaneously confused me with the (far) less interesting goings on at St. Anne's. Here is a novel crying out to be excised and adapted into a great film, but alas, who is out there to film it? Speaking generally, Hollywood is unqualified to do anything but make a mess of it."
2,So disappointed,"I adore C.S. Lewis so much... so it pains me to say that I really, really disliked this book. The first time I attempted reading it, I got 90-something pages in, and then stopped. On my second attempt, I made it all the way through the 382 pages in about three weeks' time (that is a LONG time for me). For one, it was just boring. All of the fantastic imagination and vivid imagery from the first two books was non-existent in That Hideous Strength. It was like watching black-and-white TV. Secondly, I cared nothing for any of the characters. Not even Ransom. They were all dull and very wordy without saying much of anything at all. It was also quite a bit darker than the other two books, and many of the antagonists met gruesome ends. The allegory/theology/philosophy was also very difficult to follow. Of course I got the picture of the battle of good and evil, but as to the specifics, I don't have a clue."
4,CS Lewis novel is great start for the series,"CS Lewis weaves an interesting story that helps one understand the spiritual environment in which we live. He resolves this story just enough to satisfy you but leaves enough unsaid to make you long to start volumen 2, Perelandra. Full of spiritual meaning relevant to our times."
2,Poor Printing,"It seems publishers are getting very sloppy with book printing. I purchased this book, along with the other two books in C.S. Lewis' Space Trilogy and only one was printed without slanted text. I know it is only a paperback, and a $9.00 one at that, but money is being spent. I would recommend purchasing these Scribner books at a store (new or used) where you can purchase a copy that is not a defect. It defeats the purpose of a discount if the book is a defect. I believe the work of C.S. Lewis deserves better treatment. On a positive note, the cover design for this book, as well as for Perelandra and Out Of The Silent Planet, are very well done."
1,Completely Uninteresting,"After reading the first five chapters I was simply too bored to continue. IMHO, a terrible book."
4,"Good, but great?","C.S. Lewis's book ""That Hideous Strength"" has good lines, lots of good lines. It deftly analyzes many of the problems of modern secular relationships and the secular state. But the ending is a complete deus ex machina. The killing off of all the various ""evil"" characters also feels a bit sadistic at times. There's never much suspense about how it will end. This might have been less of a problem if I was reading it as the conclusion of the trilogy, but Lewis says in the introduction that this can be read on it's own, if less profitably. The emphasis should probably be on ""less profitably""."
2,Tough beginning,Book could not hold my interest until the middle to end. Too wordy to the point that the reader wants to skip pages to get to the meat of the story
5,Excellent SciFi and frighteningly accurate social commentary,"Lewis really grabs the academic and cultural environment that is constantly at war with God, trying to push him out of existence via the raw desire to be God ourselves. And as a child of Britain, how could he leave out Arthurian legend? One of the great masters of writing, logic and apologetics at work in great fiction that tells a gripping and believable story."
2,Magic is gone,"I agree with the other reviewer...the quality of this once-incomparable show has fallen off of the cliff.Unforgettable characters are now 2 dimensional, what passes for humor would have been stale 20 years ago...I MISS MY OFFICE WORLD!! Where did you guys go?? Come baaaaaaaaaaaack!!!!Writers and producers, if you guys don't care anymore, could you please pass the production to folks who might????"
1,Reverts to the bad ones,"The Office pattern has become stereotyped lately. Every once in a while there's a good episode: where the characters are believable, the observations interesting, the humor subtle.Most of the rest of the time, the humor just becomes, well, TV-sitcom is all I can think of as how to describe it. Overwritten, strained situations in which slapstick and silliness, not deftness, play the main roles.This was a good example of a bad episode, with puerile, inappropriate slapstick. Once more, Dwight has become silly rather than interesting, (he was taken seriously for a while in seasons 2 and 3).I suspect there's some kind of battle for artistic direction in the series, one which is being most lost but hasn't been completely. E.g the previous episode was quite good."
4,All versions are pixel edited...,"Don't be fooled; it's pixelated just as on t.v.Tony's Review:This is the ONLY bad thing about these discs.I think it should have been spoken about somewhere on this site but I haven't seen any other reviewer speak about this fact. So if this information was what you were looking for, you've found the only review that specifically tells you that all the episodes are pixel edited just as on television, so no, you're not gonna see any boobs, dicks, ass or snatch. If that's what you were wondering, wonder no more. Does this mean in a few years we might see ANOTHER full set of discs unedited? I suppose it's possible that at some point in the future, they'll offer the full, un-pixilated versions, but this fact should NOT stop you from buying this set. It's great if you can live with the pixel editing. It's the same on all Season releases. Check my other cool reviews."
2,Horrible performance from Steve Carell,It was hard to give this episode only 2 stars because it had so much promise. A great performance from every actor except Steve Carell coupled with an awesome story line would have made this a 5 star episode. There is a particuarly funny bit toward the end with a member of the wearhouse that makes this episode very memorable. Only the seasoned fan should watch this one as it might put new viewers off.
2,ugh sabre!!,"like many other reviewers, i have to agree that kathy bates is horrible!! she is so unnatural and self-conscious - totally awkward. please get her off - she has no comic timing, no concept of the show, or apparently any idea of comedy in general. don't know what the writers were thinking with season six. the show needs to call it a day - it absolutely cannot survive without steve carell."
1,Terrible BluRay Packaging,This has to be the worst packaging I have ever seen. I can barley get the Blu Rays out of the package without breaking them. The office season six is not nearly as good as the other seasons and deserves a 3 out of 5
2,Slightly below average episode,I've watched this episode a couple of times and there a few truly funny scenes. The plot is ok but the acting is sub par. The multiple confessions are distracting and not very well sequenced. Pam and Jim's performance is particularly lacking.
2,Beware: Blu-ray Edition Has Issues,"I own the first 5 seasons on DVD but decided to spring for Blu for season 6. As others have noted, the Blu-ray edition has issues (in all 4 of my players) which cause the disc(s) to hiccup and freeze (my problems started with Disc 1, Episode 4, at which point I swapped them for the DVD edition). Indications are the problem is with the authoring; Firmware updates won't solve the problem and, since the disc has not been re-pressed, swapping for another set probably won't help, either."
4,Is David Hasselhoff Taking the Reigns from Steve Carelle?,"Excellent show. But how will ""The Office"" dynamic be once David Hasselhoff has traded places with Steve Carelle? The next season will be nothing short of interestingly confusing!"
2,Still going downhill,"This show lost ""it"" somewhere around the Writer's Guild strike. We had an excellent season 2 and 3 to build on and some moments in the hour-long eps of season 4. But since then, you can sense a dramatic loss in the writing direction of this show. They seem to be headed towards the ""Fonzi-jumps-the-shark"" moment within the next three seasons (current one included). Seeing it that Carrell has next season under contract, I can imagine next season being their last or second to last unless things change. ""Murder She Wrote"" was yet another ep that had some entertaining moments but there were also way too many others that simply didn't hold up against the original DNA of this show. The characters are ALL a former shell of themselves - the early seasons held so much meat to each person."
2,This is when it went down hill?,"I can't believe all the reviews that say this is when the show went down hill. Let's face it, the show has been going down since season 3. Season 2 was outstanding - some of the best writing episodes of any TV series. Season 3 built on the stories and added one great new character (Ed Helms is about the only person people don't complain about in their reviews)...but then season 4 and 5 is where the series started to get weaker. For those giving this season 2 stars (which is also what I gave it), I can't imagine you thinking season 5 was a ""5 star"" year - maybe 3 stars? My wife loved the show - that was the only reason we purchased the last two seasons, but I have convinced her to give up on The Office and save our money for something funny (Modern Family?)"
1,The show went way downhill. Don't watch this season.,"The writers really dropped the ball. None of the actors have the same characteristics that they used to have. I loved the first 5 seasons, but I hate this one. I'm not going to bother watching season 7."
3,Poor Shipping,"This DVD came out on September 7th, I pre-ordered it on September 2nd and as soon as I ordered it,te shipped date was September 13th and today is 9/14 and I still do not have any shipping info. I could ave just purchased this DVD the day it came out. Since my status is saying shipping soon and it has been since Septeber 7th, I was already charged and have no received my purchase. I wil no longer pre-order from Amazon.com anymore."
3,Worst season yet,"First off, I want to thank my fellow reviewers for bringing something to my attention. I was previously unaware that the Halloween cold ope was cut from Koi Pond. I do not watch much television, so I wait until the entire season is released on DVD. I had seen the description and picture within the set but just thought that I was going crazy. Thanks for saving me a bit of money. I will not be supporting this show any longer.On to Season 6...The show has fallen from the top. I used to watch this show religiously every season. 3 and 5 are my favorites. 6 just lost the magic. Pam is a BITCH which is annoying. Jim as manager is annoying. Dwights best moments are long past. I hate that they brought Sabre in along with Jo, and Gabe. Gabe is tolerable but Jo is just there to be there. I really would have preferred to have kept David Wallace. The way he played off of Michael's idiocy was perfect. The show is just running on vapors now. END IT!!!"
3,"Not Great, But Still The Office","I love The Office and have always been a big fan. I also tend to be less critical than some and usually prefer to choose to enjoy a show if I can. That being said, Season 6 of The Office is easily the low point so far. Especially in the first half of the season, the episodes are not great, and one of them (the one involving the Mafia guy) is what I would consider the first time The Office has made simple bad television. However, the wedding episodes are quite good, and the season definitely gets better towards the end, which led into what I thought was a much better Season 7. Not the greatest season, and probably not one I'll revisit all that often, but it's still The Office, so I still like it. I always enjoy the extra scenes and outtakes on these dvd sets, although I think there could be more special features. I'd maybe wait and buy this one far after it's released and get it on sale."
5,office,It's great and thank you so much! It was a gift and he was happy. He got it in plenty of time for Christmas.
5,Awesome Show,I absolutely love The Office series. All the characters are great and you get a good laugh at their goofy situations. Brilliantly written!
1,just a clip show,"This episode, ""the banker"", is just a clip show. I havent been insulted by one of these lazy excuses for a tv show episode since the '90s. What a shame to see this kind of a complete lack of any effort on a show that is usually so good. Very Disappointing."
4,Funny...at times,"Although I rated this 4 stars, be warned that at times the episodes just carry on and on with no laughs. However, some episodes like Mafia, Happy Hour, and Murder are non stop laughter through the entire episode. The packaging on this is very good and the extras are as funny as the episodes themselves. This DVD is great!Pros--Lots of episodes-Special Features-PackagingCons--Slow at times"
4,"Not as good as other seasons, but still great!","I love this show! Season 6 wasn't quite as good as the others, but it is still great. Also, I feel like there are slightly fewer commentaries and deleted scenes than on other seasons. It could also just be that they aren't quite as funny. Still, I'm very happy with the purchase, I can watch this show over and over and over and I will definitely get my money's worth."
2,Really Lame,"The Office seasons one through five are very good. Season six was awful and even painful to watch at times. The actors are still fine, but the writing stinks. Evidently they've run out of ideas. It's no wonder Steve Carell has left the show. In season 6 Ryan (an interesting character) was used very little and they've got him back in a relationship with Kelly (doesn't work and isn't funny). Instead, they used Oscar quite a lot -- he's one dimensional and it adds nothing to the show. The idea for The Office was great (buy the original BBC version -- it's the best). For anyone who's worked in an office setting you know there are an unlimited ""strange but true"" situations that could be explored in the show and would be hilarious. Unfortunately, the writers of The Office must have run out of steam. I paid $14.99 on Amazon for season 6 and it was $14 too much. Tip: End your collection at season 5."
2,Definitly the worst of the 6,"Let me start off by saying that this season has the worst cold openings in the show's history. The writers just didn't know what to do with these characters. They would start a large story and completely forget about it an episode later. The comedy (if you want to call it that) is so in-your-face, it's pathetic. Here's an example of the kind of jokes that's littered throughout the season. You see Kevin cry like a baby into Pam's chest, and then cut to Kevin's talking head explaining that whenever a woman hears a baby's cry, their boobs get bigger.I do not suggest this season to anyone, for me, the show jumped the shark with Stress Releif. THe only reason why I gave this 2 stars, is because of the fantastic christmas episode. Strangely enough, it's one of the only shining stars in this season."
3,A season that goes in and out,"Season 6 was probably the worst season of The Office. There were a few good episodes though. This season kinda reminded me of the few last episodes of Seinfeld. You can just tell they are running out of ideas. The season finale was truly pathetic. All the other finales were great. The season 6 finale started something and they didn't know how to finish it. The characters aren't really their usual selves in this season. Also, I hated the Kathy Bates character. She was not funny at all. Also, I don't know why the Ryan character is still on the show. He adds nothing to the humor. Even though he is a side character, he doesn't offer the one-liners such as Creed or Kevin. He was however, funny in the some of the past seasons but this one he does nothing. Hopefully season 7 delivers the goods and end the show on a good note with a great season."
3,Worst. Packaging. Ever.,"I have seasons 1-5 on DVD. This is my first blu-ray season of the office, and I wish I had the DVD's. First off, the packaging is the worst disc packaging in the history of discs. The discs are hard to take out, hard to put in, the packaging breaks easily which solves the hard to get out problem and just makes the discs fall out instantly. The menus are annoying compared to the simple ones on the DVD's, and with the DVD's (for season five anyway) once you play the episode it is easy to play the deleted scenes. On the blu-ray you have to go to extras and hunt down the deleted scenes. It's annoying compared to the simple layout we had when watching season five.But that's minor compared to the horrific packaging.Joel"
4,the office,"Timely arrival, there was a slight problem on the last disc with the volume being low. Lasted less than 1 min."
3,Something is Missing,"I came a bit late to The Office. The first episode I saw was in Season 4. Saw a few more, and ran out and bought seasons 1 and 2. Was hooked. Bought seasons 3-5. Waited anxiously for Season 6, re-watched seasons 1-5 a few times. It truly is one of the funniest, cleverest, well put together shows I've ever seen. I'd put it up there with my other favorites: Seinfeld and That 70's ShowThen came Season 6 and... blah. What happened? Something is most definitely missing and I can't quite put my finger on it. All I know is I'm not laughing. It's just falling flat. That old spark is gone. The acting isn't the same, the interactions aren't the same. I don't know, it all feels very contrived and... well.. scripted! Very disappointed in this season. My thought, after watching the first disc was, 'No wonder Carell wants to leave. Leave before this ship sinks!'Bummer :("
5,"Strong season, pleasantly surprised","I had lowered my expectations, but the season really delivers on DVD. Most actors are still in top form and the writing is relatively fresh. GO DUNDER HEADS!"
3,Why You Shouldn't Buy This (even if it's still hilarious),"This is another solid season of the The Office, full of great humor. That being said, there's a big reason to save your money here.NBC decided to cut the cold open from the episode ""Koi Pond"" for no clear reason. The opening, the halloween haunted warehouse, was probably the funniest of the season. Yet for whatever reason it has been removed from the episode on the disc - even though a clip from halloween is shown on the menu disc. You can actually still stream it the opening in question right on the NBC website. Whether it's backwards censorship or an oversight in the product creation, it's a BIG problem.Don't buy this - if sales are down for the 6th season dvd/blu ray then maybe they'll include it down the road for a purchase that's actually worth paying for."
1,Too bad Universal won't bother to fix defective discs.,"Well, I just picked up this set and, BRAVO UNIVERSAL, as of 12/20/2011 this set is still not fixed. Do a quick search on the internet and you'll see what I'm talking about.Just as described by several people here, the first three episodes play fine and then right around the 4 minute mark of episode four the disc freezes, sputters and skips ahead about 60 seconds. I haven't bothered to play the other discs, but there are widespread reports about problems with them as well.I've turned off access to the internet on the player (as some have suggested) and that doesn't do anything. I'm exchanging it, but don't have high hopes that the new one will work either.Looks like I'll either forget about this season or be forced to buy it on DVD. Again, BRAVO UNIVERSAL!"
4,Not as good as season 5,"I had to have the season, but it wasn't the best. I didn't care for Jim as the assistant manager, and I didn't like that Dwight drew away from Michael. Gladly, they fixed all that by the end of the season."
2,Disappointed,Most blu rays work but I would say 5 episodes are unwatchable due to scratching I thought very good would be much better.very disappointed.
1,The Office jumped the shark mid way thru this season...,"Wow, WHERE did my favorite show go? This season was the beginning of the end. The Office (I don't even know if it's still on anymore) is a shell of what it once was and thankfully is being put to bed, albeit too late.After one of the GREATEST seasons ever in Season 5, the show takes a serious nose dive. Pam is more annoying than ever as snarky salesperson Mom Pam. Andy has too big of a role, and Aaron (though a cute character) has a poor dynamic with the forced Andy wannabe Jim-Pam type romance. Dwight is under used. Creed and Ryan have all but disappeared. Gabe is AWFUL as is the entire Sabre deal. The unnecessary focus on Oscar with the non gay warehouse guy is reaching and also done poorly.There were some great episodes here, ""Scott's Tots"", ""Murder"" and a few other moments. But overall I regret buying this and will sell it before sullying my other Office seasons with it's presence."
2,Great Show/Poor Case Design,"My complaint has nothing to do with the creative content of the show, but with the case design. I am unsure about the DVD format, but the Blu-Ray box set has a terrible disc-holding clasp. There are two plastic prongs that the disc has to be snapped under. They are not flexible at all. I am so worried that I will chip off part of the discs when replacing them. This is unacceptable, it requires no great labor to design a proper, functioning case."
3,Caveat Emptor: Your Disc One May Be Broekn,"The content is good and if it were not for this one problem, I would have given this a 5-star review.Disc one of the Blu-ray Season 6 is broken. It is not broken in a physical sense, but rather it does not play one my Blu-ray drive (I use a PC to play Blu-Ray disc). The previews play fine, but once it is time to head to the main menu, playback stops. I am not the only one online who has experienced this issue, some say that it is a manufacturing defect. If you purchase this, you should make sure that you can return the discs, if you have this problem. You might have to do it one or two times before, you get a working disc."
3,Problematic Blu-Ray Discs,"Firstly, the container for these discs are too tight, and difficult to remove. Once removed, I faced problems loading the discs, and the first episode couldn't even play properly.I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement, and it got duly replaced, but I still faced the exact same problem. I then searched for the answer online and updated my firmware to fix it.The first episode worked wonderfully, but after that, the later episodes started skipping and hanging again.Do not recommend to buy. Perhaps you might be better off with the DVD set."
3,Heading Downhill,"The earlier seasons of The Office were so fresh and funny. By season 3, The Office had become perhaps the funniest show on the air. Seasons 4 and 5 held up to the standard. Season 6 is where it all begins to unravel.Many of the episodes in the sixth season are just painful to watch. I have never been a fan of clip shows and fans of this show had to sit through one this season. Clip shows are nothing more than giving the writer's time to be less creative. It is funny to see favorite moments from seasons past but that is why DVD sales and Netflix exist.In other seasons, it was very hard to pick a favorite episode because most of them were so outstanding. Season six offered a few entertaining shows but nothing that made me want to watch an episode again. Yes, this is the season when Jim and Pam get married and have a baby but other than that, this is just a mediocre season."
4,Best Floor Liner in the Industry!,"Pros: High quality, great looking, unsurpassed fit and finish, and they do the best job of keeping the trash on the liner and off of the carpet.Cons: Pricey, a bit of a pain to remove and replace when you want to vacuum your carpet because it is a single piece, the black color shows everything and it's pretty tough to get them clean to the point where they look like new.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my WeatherTechs and feel that it was a great purchase for my truck."
5,VERY INFORMATIVE READING,BEFORE VISITING BELIZE YOU REALLY MUST READ THIS BOOK. THE PRICE IS RIGHT WITH FAST DELIVERY SO WHY HESITATE? I read up a lot about Belize before visiting and this book was the most informative and even cheaper than the others - so don't go the long way around....start with this book first.
5,"An addicting, underrated game.","My older sister and I used to play this game all the time and when the time came, we brought it up and realize we had to find a copy of it so we could feel young again. Now I've gotten multiple friends of mine hooked on it. The game is like a colorful, item and asset filled version of Monopoly sort of. You have to buy shops, keep them stocked with items, and when you rivals land on it, they have to buy an item. If they buy out your store, they can chose to buy your store to expand an already existing one of theirs or they can open their own new one. It's really fun and you never know who is willing to help you out or to screw you over. I highly recommend this game to anyone!"
4,EG Daily's ten minuets on screen save the day,"Jon Cryer is little too hormonal, Demi Moore is a little too ""husky"" but E.G Daily in the small role of Cryer's older brothers' girlfriend rocks. If is wasn't for her talking him into going to a bar he would never have met Laura (Moore) and had his virginity taken and his heart stomped on (all the while taking great candid's of a pre-boob job Moore)."
4,No Small Affair,"What I really like about this movie is the singing of the classic tunes, ""My Funny Valentine"", to be specific. I would like to know who is the singer, and if there is a soundtrack available from this movie ??"
5,OH MY GOD!!! THIS MOVIE IS AWSOME!!!,This is a great movie about a kid who spends his life savings and throws away his dream of photography only to help a lovely lady get her dream of becoming a famous singer. You have to watch this movie! It never gets boring and the story is great. And the only thing that makes it alot better is that its got Demi Moore and she looks mad HOT in this movie!!!
4,Very underrated comedy,"This stars Jon Cryer and Demi Moore in fairly early roles for both of them. While it isn't going to be on anyone's best of all time lists, there are some very funny bits in this film which are clever and do not resort to stupidity. Considering his youth at the time of this, I thought Cryer was excellent in it. George Wendt has a supporting role which he does very well."
5,Still the Prince of All Documentaries,"Although there have been a number of very good documentaries over the last few years, with spectacular venues and budgets, the wonderful series 'Civilisation' still remains the benchmark for erudition and entertainment in documentaries with regard to history, culture and art.Make sure your children see this, if you wish them to be 'civilised,' since it does not repeat on television anymore these days. This is a necessary framework to help them get the ""big picture"" of the Western tradition which the schools are rarely able to accommodate anymore.A must see, again and again over the years. It reminds us of who we are, and how we have gotten here."
3,Major Contribution,"I have watched this three times and can hardly wait to see it again.Should be five stars. However, the color is very washed out as so often happens with a VHS tape that is many years old. This should be re-released on a DVD to do this magnificent work justice."
5,WHY?,"...can't I buy this at home in the UK where it was produced? I saw this series umpteen times on TV as a youngster and now as a history teacher want to share its features and Lord Clarke's insights with a new generation who very much need a broad view of Western culture. Anyone looking for perfection is bound to be disappointed (with this and everything else) but for the reasonable-minded, I have never seen anything which better treats of these matters in a popular format."
4,pretty damn cool record.,"Mix in parts of Huggy Bear, the Pixies,& beer and you get this pleasant little record. Some cool indie-post punk rock. The lyrics are great. I really like the boy/girl vocals. Reminded me of the Pixies a lot. They kicked ass live! I think ( but not sure)they're disbanded. Get this cd if you like indie music. Not a bad song in the bunch. Next time your wondering if you should get that Good Charlette album, do yourself (and everyone else) a favor and Buy this one instead. These guys sound much better and don't need to wear mascara to feel ""punk"" LONG LIVE ROCK!"
1,A Real Dog,"The sound quality is just awful, and Chet isn't playing very well. Chet is sitting on a couch and playing into a cheap mic. The Tokyo concert with Harold Danko and Jon Engels, identified as 1987, is a LOT nicer (although the picture quality isn't very good). The Jazz Icons DVD is also a winner."
4,pay attention while reading this book,"This book is a trip! You really have to pay attention while you read the book because they give clues all the way through it. There is a twist at the end that is totally unexpected. I had to re-read the last few chapters to make sure I read it right.The story is told from Jack Trainor's point of view. Jack is a psychiatrist, and has a younger sister Kate. Kate is a writer, but she seems extremely unstable. The focus of the story is Jack's differing relationships with women. By the end of the story, there is a resolution in both Kate's relationships with men through the resolution of Jack's relationship with women. All this resolution comes because Jack faces the truth of the horrible event that framed their youth.I would highly recommend this book. The librarian who checked it out to me told me it was strange, but I disagree. It takes a little bit to get used to, but the story grabs you as you get further in. Happy reading!"
3,a good way to pass time,"Well, as a matter of fact, I bought this book for my wife but I decided to read it anyway and I found it quite interesting. Not my favourite genre but surely a nice book and well worth the price."
1,"Awful, Awful movie.","You have to know first that this is the only movie in 35 years that my family turned off before finishing. We can put up with a lot of abuse just to say we watched the whole thing, but this move was that bad.The ONLY reason I bought this on Amazon was as a gag gift for Christmas. I hear they made a second one and that the book was good. I don't know anything about that, but this move is horrible."
1,Hobolen Chicken Emergency,I can not rate since I have yet to receive the movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
5,Great slide,"I bought this slide for my Daughter's 3rd Birthday after reviewing all the slides, and their reviews, on Amazon. She loves it! So far, so good. She tends to try to walk up it. so we have to get after her, but this slide is very durable. She has long legs, so she doesn't slide very far, but she still has fun. She loves the fact that it's a carrot too."
5,Great for indoor play!,I have this in th the house for my 23 month old twins and they love it. I find it very sturdy & it looks adorable. I have to fight to keep my 6 year old off of it too because he loves it as well!
1,Very UNSTABLE and UNSAFE. Do not buy unless you have a way to mount the base somehow.,"I loved it when I purchased it online and it met every expections I had with this slide. Great slide and just as great design BUT when slide is in upright postion and locked it is VERY UNSTABLE and UNSAFE. It can be easily be knoked over even by an infant or it can just easily tip over when child tries to climb it or slide it. You have to physically hold both carrots by your hands to keep it stable while child is trying to play. Just one oversight incidence by the parents, child will get hurt. Since, I do like the product otherwise, I am trying to figure out a way to mount the legs on ground before I can allow this to be used. Please do not buy this unless you have a way to mount the base on the ground somehow."
4,NOT Pistachio,"These oven mitts are great though my husband and I were shocked when we opened the box - they are BRIGHT lime green! That said, these mitts are quite comfortable and flexible for both of our hand sizes and for being silicone."
1,"MODERATTO, UN CHISTE DE MAL GUSTO","Señores, otro disco con covers para variar, esta banda de baja monta imitada por partida doble, una vez al glam rock de los 80's y la segunda con versiones de otras canciones.La vardad no me explico como hay fans de esta banda, supongo que son muy jóvenes y no recuerdan a Poison y Motley Crue en sus inicios y mucho menos a las verdaderas bandas de metal como Iron Maiden y Judas Priest.Señores, un buen consejo, no gasten un centavo en este disco ni en ningún otro de esta seudo banda de mal llamado metal en español. en mi país CR estuvieron en vivo este recien 27-01-08 y el público los hechó a punta de cubos de hielo y botellas plásticas, no duraron en tarima ni 25 minutos."
3,Typical 'B' Video,"OK, so PYTHON will never be considered a masterpiece. D'uh, it's a B movie; they're supposed to stink. Given the plot was rice-paper thin, the monster was about as realistic as a Texan actually liking tufu, and the flat dialogue... well, there's not much else is there? Seeing several cult actors snuff it was fun though, 'cause let's face it- their acting in this movie made you want to see them die even more. And Frayne (the star)- just keep the cinema roadkills Bruce Campbell made (and still does) in mind; you can succeed by producing [junk]. Hopefully, your work on the SCORPION KING will be swept off the cutting room floor and put in the DVD edition."
2,"ugh, another disappointing big snake movie!","Python is probably one of the worst ""attack of the killer snake"" type movies ever. The biggest problem I had is that after an hour, only ONE appearance by the gigantic king-size snake occurs! The rest of that time is occupied with crappy and irrelevant dialogue mainly involving pointless chit chat between members of the police department. When I say pointless I really mean it- you won't care about anything they have to say at *all*, I promise. At least the last 30 minutes are saved thanks to the killer snake slithering through an underground facility, chasing teens and killing them one by one. This is the reason the movie gets 2 stars out of me. Everything else about the movie is forgettable, boring and excessively dialogue-heavy."
2,Bad Snake. Actors With a Name. Movie with Nothing Else.,"If you've seen the movie ANACONDA, then you've seen PYTHON. The only difference is in locale and cast. The special effects in some scenes were decent, but they didn't mesh so well spliced next to the old-school special effects. The opening scene is promising, and the first twenty minutes of the film isn't all that bad either. However, after that the film quickly falls apart. The movie has a fairly large cast of actors who actually have names. However, the only reason they signed on for this piece of sewage was for the paycheck. Mindless entertainment with just a few glimmers of originality, but no taste."
3,Pretty Decent Flick,"If your into B-Movies as much as I am, then this film is for you. True, the acting, CGI effects, and plot is a bit lower then normal standards (but hey, is a B-movie ever above standards). Just by the title ""PYTHON"", you know your into a cornfest. Best advice when seeing this, don't have high expectations.If you ignore the fact that this is a B-movie, and set your acting and CGI standards lower then from something like ""STAR WARS: REVENGE OF THE SITH"" (actually...MUCH lower), then you may get a kick out of this flick."
3,Snnnaaaaaakkkeeee!,"Okay let me start by saying this movie does not take itself seriously. Whew! Too many times a film of this kind can't quite figure out what it wants to be. Not a problem here. It's all tounge and cheek . William Zabka(The bully from the Karate Kid and Just one of the Guys) Plays Deputy Greg, a Small town Deputy Sherrif Who just never left town to become that hotshot FBI agent. He's got bigger problems, seems a military flight carring a VERY LARGE and VERY HUNGARY Experimental Snake has gone down in the woods surrounding the small town of Ruby. The rest as they say is history. Robert England and Casper Van Dien also show up to hunt the Great and Hungary Beast The Dvd itself has some nice extras and a great 3D Menu. It looks and sounds great. If you liked Anaconda you'll like Python."
1,Why?,"Why do movie companies waste their time and mine making movies this dumb? A snake with ears? Snakes can't hear sounds in the air. They have to have their head pressed against the ground to ""hear,"" and this only allows them to pick up ground vibrations. The python in this movie hears the characters when they are running around. The story is dumb (the author obviously doesn't know as much as he thinks he does about snakes. They should have read a good snake book, like Fangs of the Serpent) and the acting is mediocre. I'm still not sure why the bad guy even brought the thing to the USA in the first place."
1,bad bad bad,this movie is (junk) beyond explanation. anaconda is jaws compared to this. 129 foot python should be fighting and spitting acid at godzilla instead of helpless (....) the creators and writers did not think this through. i watched it twice for a laugh and sat through it picking out mistakes and just stupid (stuff) that shouldnt be in the movie. like every scene there is new dramatic music to match every terrible line. and also there is pathetic attemps at comedy. stay away- do urselves a favor
3,not as good as anaconda,"Python is an okay movie to watch. The snake effects are very good, but the movie lacked taste. And the sex scene in the begining is what knocked down two stars on my review. I think nudity is stupid and shouldn't be in movies. Anyway, this movie has some great CGI work, but like I said, it wasn't as good as anaconda."
3,What is it about Giant Snakes?,"For me, seeing this Giant Snake Film was the third in a series of films featuring the obligatory Giant Snake. Of course, Anaconda remains the standard to which all such films must measure up to. It features Jon Voight, Ice Cube, and Jennifer Lopez. Python bills Casper Von Diem, Robert Englund, and Wil Wheaton as its stars. While these actors are not A-list, they are somewhat cult favorites. None of them, however, are the featured actor in the film. Somewhat of a disappointment. This film does know what it is. It's a semi-parody and does have the necessary ridiculous elements to carry the concept. See it with a group of friends so that you can share the ""badness"". Check out King Cobra if this movie is your cup of tea.SPOILER ALERT----PLOT REVELATIONS---- If you are like me and watched STAR TREK: Next Generation, you need to see this film. Wesley Crusher gets what he had coming to him."
5,love it!!!!!,First this docter named Dr.Rudoulph(freddy kruger guy) create's this huge 129 foot snake (witch is called PYTHON). He transports it and it gets loose in the cargo. it eat all the crew members and the plane crashed.THE snake lived the crash and got loose in this little town called Ruby. It starts eating the locals one by one. This snake also spits acid at its prey during this movie...preety sick..anyway this FBI team heads in to try to take it down but does not kill it. Some people in the town try to take it down and they burn the snake in acid. blood sqirts out of the snake and it dies screaming.
3,good but not great,"I thought Python was really good,and I know a lot of people didnt like it,but I think there big dumbos.It has lots of gore,like when the women gets her head choped off by the pythons tail and lands in the guys lap. It then pukes acid on the guy,and burns him to nothing but bones and blood. Its when two men are carrying a huge python on a plane and it gets out of its cage.He eats the crew and the plane crashes near a town called Ruby.First it kills a lesbian couple.Then it starts killing the locals one by one,leaving there bodies everywere.A small army tries to stop it,but the python eats 4 of the men.A good movie,but not great.If you like this movie you should see Python2,Boa,Boa vs Python,Andoconda,Silent Predotars,Crocodile,Crocodile2, and King Cobra."
4,Here is a true B movie,"Yes, some of the acting is bad. Yes, the story isn't that plausible. Yes, the special effects should have been better. But, hey this is a B movie. I gave it 4 stars because of Casper Van Dien being in the movie. I do like to see him in movies but I was a little disappointed because he didn't even have his shirt off. Ok, unless you are a Casper Van Dien fan or a B movie fan you will probably not enjoy this movie. But, if you realize it is a B movie and it does have some good acting in it, you may just enjoy it."
1,FOWL SMELLING DRECK,"If your gonna make a crappy clone of anaconda on an almost decent budget,drop all scenes with stupid extras that cant act.steal an idea from a movie like ""the relic""and shoot the damn creature in the dark, not bright sun light like these guys did.If you cant think of good lines for people like casper van dien and robert england to say, hire someone who can or at least steal them."
4,PURE FUN,"I'm amused at all the Rogert Eberts out there who take movies like this so seriously that they need to attack it. The point is if you take this movie seriously, you miss the fun. It's a SPOOF, people! It mocks itself so how could anybody mock it?! This movie is to ""horror creature films"" as Scream was to ""horror movies."" My friends and I were looking for some amusing entertainment, saw the title, and grabbed it. If seeeing Wil Weaton with purple hair, Casper Van Dien with a cheesy mustache, Jenny McCarthy's head fall off, William Zabka in a classic fist fight in a kids playground, Robert Englund blowing himself up, Sean Walens do an evil version of Barnie Fife doesn't make you smile and bring lighthearted entertainment to you - then I don't know what will. This film was a blast and don't let the Eberts steal it from you."
2,HSSSSSSTERICALLY FUNNY!,"I haven't laughed at a movie in some time, but ""Python"" is one funny movie. And, one BAD movie! There is some over the top overacting, some really horrible non-acting, and the special effects are laughably crude and inconsistent. Also, why doesn't the snake use its acid on anybody when it's down to the final minutes? Casper van Dien continues to prove he's the worst actor in some time; Robert Englund looks embarrassed; and only Jenny McCarthy adds some zest with her sexual manuevering as a potential house buyer. William Sabka tries hard, and acquits himself in some ways. The rest of the cast---oh boy! The opening sequence is tasteless and unnecessary. But if you need a good laugh, this is one to give you some!"
1,Bummer,"I have seen better acting in a grade school play. The special effects were a throw back to the 1920,s The python was as frightning as Bozo the clown. The script must have been salvaged by a janitor from a 4th grade drama class. The opening credits and closing credits were the best parts of the film."
1,Really Really Really Really a messed up movie,While Anaconda had a beautiful touch to it that i liked. That is why i rented Python. I hoped it would be just as good a snake movie. Oh boy how i was wrong. This movie is out and out terrible. There are words that perectly describe this movie but they don't exist yet unfortunately. The plot is stupid and doesn't really revolve much around the snake. The snake itself is a ripoff and doesn't provide a an uplift to this sad sacked movie. The python's size is constantly misjudged and shown on the screen. Did anybody read the script before signing on to this one. The gore has edgey attitude but turns out to be mostly average. The sexuality is unnecessary like the woman caught in the bathtub in climax of the film (...). Thank god i never saw this movie in theaters i would've wasted my money for walking out in the first five minutes of the movie.
5,wish this show was still on the air,"if Warner Bros. ever decides to put another animated Batman show on TV, they should consider bringing this show back on TV."
4,Nice series with an interesting flavor,"I'm a longtime Batman fan, and this one is pleasing to watch. What is particularly interesting is the old style with modern graphics. The characters act like the old days, but the series is actually quite modern. Also, you frequently think the plot is going to be obvious, but then they throw a twist in during the episode that keeps it interesting."
1,Never Received it,"I ordered this as a Xmas gift and to date, I've never received it.Craig T. Liebergot"
3,Great Potential,The book started off amazing and then got a bit boring and...odd towards the end. However it does contain great messages and it is brilliantly written.
5,I fell in love with Socrates,"I searched a used bookstore for an 1 1/2 hours knowing that inevitably God would reveal a wonderful book before me. When I found Walter Mosely's novel, I knew it was 'the one.' I loved Socrates, the main character, in a way I have never loved a book's character. And I am especially looking forward to the follow-up novel, Walking the Dog. (Soon to be released!)"
4,"Maybe Mosley ain't so bad, after all.","This is another boonie dog book review from Wolfie and Kansas. When we reviewed Walter Mosley's book ""A Little Yellow Dog"", we complained that it was miscaninthropic. In Mosley's latest book, ""Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned"", a collection of generally quite good short stories about an ex-con named Socrates Fortlow, Mosley displays an improved attitude towards canines. In a story entitled ""Black Dog"", Fortlow rescues a large black dog who was run over by a car. Fortlow also punches out the driver who committed the atrocious act. Now that dogs have moved from the status of evil nemesis to victims in need of rescue from benevolent humans in Mosley's writing, perhaps in the future Mosley will portray us in a positive light."
3,Not quite what I expected,"This book did'nt grasp and hold my attention like the Easy Rawlins books. I guess I was looking for a good Walter Mosley mystery, and this was'nt mystery at all. I can't say that I will follow the Socrates series as I did the Easy Rawlins series."
2,Gates Of Paradis,I wasn't really able to finish this book. It just never caught my attention that way that other V. C. Andrews books did. I found it sort of boring.
4,Gates of Paradise,"As with all of V. C. Andrews books, I found Gates of Paradise compelling, difficult to put down, and I would recommend it to all my friends,"
2,Poor Editing on a fantastic authors work.,"I have always loved V.C. Andrews work. My review is not of the writing, storyline or, at times, impossible plots but is of the editing.While reading this e-version I found over 54 editing typos and mistakes.It seems to me that if we're going to SELL a book, of any kind, we should edit!!I am dissapointed by the publishing company releasing something that shows how little they truly care about their customers."
1,Not my favorite in the series,I thought Annie was a spoiled little brat throughout the novel. I actually wished Tony was killed in the first few chapters instead of Heaven and Logan. I think the book could've been better without the repeating of history (Annie getting convinced to dye her hair like Leigh and Tony trying to rape her the same way he tried to do with Heaven)...it would've been nice to have a story from Fanny's viewpoint.
2,What is the purpose of this book?,"The same events could have happened, minus 200 pages of continuing saga of Annie being mistreated by Tony. Her character is whiny, boring, and vapid; I just wanted it all to end."
3,Annie is not a Stone wall,"This book is more like 3 1/2. I would have liked it more if Annie did not whine all the damned time! She was nothing like Heaven! She was virtually spineless! All Annie did was complain and complain. When Heaven hit hard times, she straightened her back and dealt with it. It just seemed with age, Tony became more and more demented. This is not the man who helped toughen Heaven into an even stronger young woman. Unfortunately, Tony is a sick, weak, broken man who is caught up in the image of Leigh, Jillian, and then Heaven and Annie. But back to Annie. She just got on my nerves and she was spoiled. I skipped over a lot of passages, unfortunately. Well, since I am a Die Hard V.C. Andrews fan, with the exception of her Wildflower series, I feel I have been generous with my rating. I think I would have liked Annie as a protagonist IF she had a backbone, that's all!"
3,Not too bad.,"This book is a must read if you are reading the series of books as a whole. It's not the best book, but it's worth sticking out till the end. Annie is not my favorite character, but I liked her better than Christie in the Cutler series."
3,Not to Shabby!,"I didn't think this book was too bad, but not at all like the other Casteel books. I was sad when Heaven died, only because Annie is a whiny little brat. Not at all like her mother. I was feeling sorry for Tony at the beginning, but that quickly changed towards the middle of the book. As it turned out, my favorite character was Troy because the only emotional parts of the book were when Troy was on the scene. I recommend the book, but the other books were much better!!"
1,Whine Whine Whine Whine Whine,"All Annie Stonewall can do is complain and then go into long and drawn out incestuous fantasies about Luke Jr.The aging Tony Tatterton even is overly drawn out because YOU KNOW what is going to ultimately end up happening. Yes, you will need to read if it if you're into the Casteel series but you won't enjoy it as much as the others.Annie will make you hate her because all she can do is complain about EVERYTHING!"
4,"A wonderful book, with a few downfalls...","I honestly liked this book, yet there were a lot of parts that irritated me. This was when Annie complained all the time. (Such as when she said, 'I miss this, and I miss that.. etc) There was a lot of repeating. I think we already knew that Annie missed her parents! However, more interesting parts consists of when she discovered Troy still alive after all that time she though he was dead, Tony being the lost and lonely person he was and how Annie managed to conquer it all and not let anyone stop her from being healthy again. I couldn't put this book down, so if you are weighing on whether or not you should read this book, I recommend it very much so. :)"
1,:-(,"I hated this book. Annie was in Farthy like two seconds before she started complaining about every tiny little thig. She just kept whining that she wanted Luke and about the stupid nurse. So she had a mean nurse, so what. I think I am being extremely generous in giving this book in even one star. Unless you're a fan who has to read every single book of VCA's, don't bother."
4,This book was ok,"Hello I would like to say first of all, V.C. is a girl named Virginia. Second, this book was pretty good. I agree with some of my fellow readers that Annie was whining a lot. Did it seem to any one else like more of a child of 13 or 14 then a child of 18? I had to double check and make sure that's what it said in the beginning. It did seem to go no forever. I think the series could have gone on without this book, but if your a hard core V.C. Andrews fan, I would definatly read this book."
3,Not exactly what I'd expected,"Having read a previous title by this author, ""The Bear Hunter's Century"", which I highly recommend, I was a bit disappointed with this book. While it was certainly informative, I found it to be a bit dry and redundant. Perhaps that was unavoidable given that the author set out to recount the references to the grizzly bear found in the Lewis and Clark journals. There is a good deal of the author's analysis of the writings. Toward the end of the book the author takes to task those who have used the Lewis and Clark writings to advance their own views and agendas concerning the grizzly bear and the environment. It seemed to me that in a more restrained way the author was guilty of the same."
3,Wild and Sexy Killer Chicks!,"This is certainly one of the more wild Hong Kong action films I've seen in awhile. The action is cool, the women are sexy and the entertainment value is high. A genre piece to be sure, but it works. If you have any problems with women using their feminine wiles to get what they want, as well as a considerable amount of female-female violence, then you should probably run screaming from this film. Thoughly disreputable fun."
4,crazy Kill,"This movie falls in the genre of j-adventure, not enough blood for a splatter film and not enough nudity/sex for a pink film. What you do have is an interesting story of a woman who becomes an assassin for the right reason and stops for love, unfortuately those involved don't want her to quit. This movie was entertaining and well acted for the caliber of film it was. There were parts of the movie that could have been better but over all the movie was an enjoyable passage of time."
3,Not a great movie by any stretch but it's okay to rent.,"Rent don't buy. There are some truly sick scenes that I thoroughly enjoyed, but they were few and far between."
1,This Movie Was Wak!,"This movie sucked. It was a pointless film to start with, and the DVD just made it worse. I would very strongly discourage anyone from buying or even viewing this horrid film. Although this is only my opinion, if you are looking for a good action or thriller, I would suggest any of the ""Die Hard"" films."
2,Good Picture Quality... but Incomplete,I have seen the movie a few times and in my opinion this DVD edition is the best in term of picture quality. Unfortunately it is incomplete. Murder scene in the swimming pool is heavily cut (is it too violent?)
2,An Overrated Cult Favorite,"""Naked Killer"" is an outrageously trashy yet derivative Hong Kong action-thriller for the ""Basic Instinct"" crowd. The movie has its legion of admirers, but this sort of kinetic mayhem was better served by filmmakers such as John Woo and Tsui Hark. Caveat emptor!"
3,Very entertaining movie - Cult Classic,"First off, BUY THE IMPORT VERSION, not the recently re-released domestic with english dub.The way I see it, a movie is more enjoyable when you see it in it's original language.This is a different kind of movie with just about every cheap trick to attract viewers. But it all somehow works! However, it still does not contain the uncut scenes that some of us have been waiting for. While the movie may seem longer in the domestic version than the import version (due to NTSC running slower than PAL), it is still the same movie.This flick is definitely one you want to put on only when the kids are already asleep. . ."
3,'Naked Killer' FOX release on DVD,"This is a great disc for the price, however, it has been trimmed of some violence and sexuality. If you want this film at full strength, find the Tai Seng release."
2,"Color, not as pictured","Nice but be aware that the photo color does not appear correctly. Sink is a medium, to medium light forest green."
4,"Not ""Kristin Lavransdatter""","First of all, when I read Sigrid Undset's ""Kristin Lavransdatter"" I was instantly smitten. Easily it went to my personal top ten list of favorite books. Also, last year I read Undset's much smaller novel ""Gunnar's Daughter"" and was very pleased with that as well. I guess my expectations were too high with these first two examples, for I was a bit disappointed with this first book in the tetralogy. Don't get me wrong I liked it well enough, but I thought it just wasn't up to standard with her other work. I'll continue with the next three books, so I hope for one of those to blow me away."
1,don't even try it!,I have tried two of these cards and both of them failed within a week. I am using a Nikon D100 and have good results other brands of memory cards. If you're using this card in a professional setting don't even try it! I've been burned twice with this brand.
2,Had card error once after 3 weeks,"Bought one card 3 weeks ago and used it in a Canon A75. Took over a thousand pictures. Everything looked fine until today when the camera showed a card error message. There were only 21 shots stored at the time. Had to re-format the card to make it usable again, but lost all stored shots. Who knows when it'll do it again!"
1,Worst Bellman interpretation I ever heard,"I ordered this album to add to my already existing Bellman collection and little did I know that it was recorded in English (should have been mentioned on the website). Also, this is the worst Bellman interpretation I have ever heard. Although Martin Best sings in English, it is hard to understand what he is singing and the style he choose to use was baroque or borderline opera. Too bad Martin didn't do more research, he might have found out that Bellman wrote and sang for the lesser fortunate. Tavern goers, alcoholics, prostitutes etc. a more vulgar, raw and direct style, in complete contrast to Martin's own style which if you ask me, sounds more like an Germanic English blend. I would have given this a zero star rating if it would have been possible.I am waiting for Caiman (seller) to respond. I do not hold them responsible for the fact that the album reeks though I must say that I never would have ordered the album knowing it to be sung in English."
4,Intresting preformence,Worth watch...she sings just fine and it didnt look like she was forcing her self on the high notes at all...im very impressed with her singing and look very cute during the preformance...a must buy for a church fans..i personally think its better then the first video that came out....shows alot of improvement on her voice.
2,"Great talent, great music and a huge disappointment","This is a benchmark for how NOT to record sound tracks.You buy Charlotte's recordings to hear her truely amazing voice and you have such high hopes that her voice will be recorded in a way that shows some respect for her incredible talent.Then you play her latest DVD and your heart sinks.Charlotte's previous Voice of An Angel DVD (not the CD) is recorded so well that you can't turn it off. On the other hand, this DVD's voice track is recorded so poorly that it just makes you sick. I'll put mine in the stack of stuff to trade.Her singing sounds as if she's in an other room. Her speaking voice during the narrations however, sounds crystal clear so you know that the recording technicians are robbing you of the chance to hear this truely great singing talent. These ""alleged"" technicians should find something else to do becides making DVDs.So Sad."
1,A Dull Journey,"I have always wanted to visit the Holy Lands. However, if I do, this Video is a reminder not to take Miss Church along. She provides no more than sterile renditions of religious favorites, while going from place to place with her as the focal point of attention. I would have been much more pleased with her providing a narration of a video of these lands; while being out of sight and refraining from singing. Her voice simply doesn't provide the warmth and emotion necessary to move an individual through such an experience. This video may suffice for an elementary school crowd, but doesn't do it for me."
5,Wonderful DVD,"Another wonderful presentation by Ms. Church. The quality of the sound and imagery is stunning. Her presentation is better than the previous performance. Her ability to effortlessly sing the high notes like ""an angel"" is very remarkable. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates fine music."
2,Not so hot,"Charlotte is not as hot as the public thinks that she is. Her voice is being pushed to much. Look at her jaw...IT QUIVERS!!!! That is the sign of a pushed voice! If a voice is pushed enough, it can bo lost. Charlotte, get a new voice teacher, before it's to late!!!!"
4,Dutilleux - who?,"After hearing Henri Dutilleux for the first time (""The Shadow of Time"") on a recent NPR broadcast, I immediately ordered his complete orchestral works, available on this four CD set. I am not disappointed. His music is very accessible and deserves a much wider audience. I highly recommend this set."
4,complete?,"How can Chandos clain this to be a complete orchestral collection when they leave out his ballet, <Le Loup>. Ok. There are dancers on stage, but it is a full orchestra that plays it, and it has yet to see the light of day completely recorded anywhere.Shame on Chandos for overlooking this."
5,The Face in My Mirror is a realistic tale,"I really enjoyed the book The Face in My Mirror by Maureen Wartski because it is a realistic tale about an adopted Vietnamese-American teenager, Mai Houston, searching for her roots. She begins her quest after a racially-motivated incident against her in her small Iowa town. While she spends her summer with her aunt, Lien, and cousins in Boston, Mai at first doesn't really feel welcome, especially by Lien, who seems to be very cold to her. During this time, Mai learns secrets about members about her family and falls in love. The book is well-written and moves quickly and the revelations of secrets will keep the reader interested. The book also contains realistic depictions of racism and its effects, family relationships, teenage life, the plight of immigrants and the influence of gangs. I recommend the book for young students starting in the sixth grade."
3,Very Large Size..,My mother lives with us and we use these pads to protect the bed and chair. Because we need to have a steady supply on hand it is much easier to purchase these types of items with Amazon and let them deal with the shipping. We cannot find a better price locally and that includes the shipping charges. I would recommend and will continue to purchase this item though Amazon.
2,nothing special!,"it's just like ordinary black tea, with a fancy name.before you buy it in this much quantity, make sure you tried it first and liked it."
1,The Indians,I did not enjoy this book very much. I found it to be some what repititious and boring. All they discussed was his way to find his heritage. In some ways it was interesting only because it explained some of their way of life and traditions. I found that the reading was easy but it took me a long time to finish reading it because it didn't hold my interest. I found it interesting to know how some one lives a day to day life so diffrent form us. In general the book was not very interesting and i did not enjoy it. I was asked to read this book for North American Literature class. We had about 4 weeks to finish the book.
5,Chevy Logo Mat,"Great addition to the front chevy mats I bought! Although, it would've been nice if they came in a set of two like the front mats did. BE SURE to order 2 qty because this price is just for one. Luckily, this item shipped to me in 2 days so my car was only without the other mat for one day. But they are a great addition to your chevy to keep original mats clean and nice!"
2,"Lighweight, not for traffic","Similar to the front seat floor mats recommended, these are lightweight and not really akin to heavy duty use."
3,good product,product replaces easy works as it should not the problem I thought it was it was a connecting wire after all
2,Seen it all before...,"Good actors and no bad preformances. That's really all the praise I can give this movie. Otherwise, it was completely recycled pieces of a dozen other ""prison"" movies. I did't detect one original thought or scene in the entire move. To wit: Young, naive boy thrown into tough prison population. Seen it. Tough lifer who runs the prison. Seen it. Lifer takes newcomer under his wing. Seen it. Blacks and whites don't get along. Seen it. Have chance for parole but are denied (with cliche ""I'll get you out!"" father scene.) Seen it. Talk about and plan an escape. Seen it.I was really disappointed in this movie. The cliches' just kept piling up. Any I won't even bring up the lame ending!"
3,Nothing Special!!!!,"This movie was o.k I guess after all, I have definitely seen worse. However, I really didn't feel like this was a real enough depiction of a prison drama. I thought it was too watered down. Come on, everybody knows that prison is no playground like they tried to make it seem. And, there certainly is no veteran inmate waiting there to take you up under his wing like Willem Dafoe did Edward Furlong. Prison is a lot more brutal than they showed me in this movie. Willem Dafoe is the only reason I took the time out to entertain the thought of watching this movie (nothing against Edward Furlong). I couldn't even recognize Mickey Rourke, and Tom Arnold was weak. At some points in this movie I actually wondered were they intentionally making a mockery out of prison films in general because it just seemed so false. To top it off, towards the middle to the end I kinda got bored with it to be honest."
3,Didn't live up to the book,The enjoyed the movie but it was missing some continuity. I don't think I would have enjoyed the movie much at all if I had not read the book and been to fill in some of the parts that were left out. I worked in a large county jail for a few years and can say that the attitudes among the prisoners as well as some of the relationships between guards and prisoners were realistic.
3,Bleak and Realistic,I found this movie to be a very bleak and realistic depiction of prison life. It shows how the men that are incarerated make a life for themselves behind bars and how they have to survive a very violent and primitive dog eat dog society. It also shows how a young man can go into this atmosphere and is almost forced to become even worse just to survive. It is a good movie but I didn't find it to be very entertaining but it was informative and realistic.
3,they sound okay but they didnt fit my ears,"maybe i have a big head but, the bottoms of the headphones do not cover my ears. sound leaks out, bass is lost. i would have to use a blowtorch to re-shape the plastic in order to make it fit my ears squarely. i dont want to do that, so i think i'm just going to send em back if i can. these headphones feel very cheap. what did i expect for four jacksons?"
2,Not Worth the Money,First the good news. The sound quality is very good. Fit is poor and the stiff cord is in the way and annoying. Was disappointed in general. Definately NOT Studio Quality.
2,k,"They didnt fit my ears. sound is good, but if it doesnt fit my ear, then there is no point in using them.WACKNESS!"
2,They are on their way back as I speak...,"I am returning these because they don't cover my ears. They gap quite a bit at the bottom. They do the same to my husband. He did some review before buying these and was surprised as the poor quality. I could use them but I figured for the price, I should have something that works right."
2,The product finishing is terrible.,"It sounds good, I'll give you that. But the finishing is terrible. The cord that connects the ear parts unglues from the head part in a matter of days. It does not fit well, too. I thought that even a low-priced Behringer headphone would still be awesome. Guess I was wrong."
3,"accurate sound, good bass, uncomfortable earcups","I want to like these headphones, the sound is clean and accurate with solid bass. Sadly, the HPS5000 is the most uncomfortable headset I've ever owned. The ear cups are small and stiff, the overhead plastic band feels like a clamp and is poorly adjustable. Ten minutes and I'm ready to settle for the ratty little speakers in my laptop."
2,Ouch!,"Pretty disappointed with these. They sound a little worse than my Panasonic RP-HTX7s, but that's not the worst part. The HPS5000 is *uncomfortable*, these things must be designed for kids, because they sure don't fit my head, a problem I haven't run into with other headphones. The cans need to have a few more degrees of movement for them to fit properly, as it is the tops of the pads pinch the tops of my ears, and the bottom edges don't even come into contact.Bottom line, I wouldn't recommend these to anyone else without at least test fitting a pair, and even then I'd have reservations because other headphones don't have this kind of fitment issue. Really wish I could return these things."
2,"Good sound, BAD FIT!","GOOD SOUND, TERRIBLE FIT - for short review.GOOD: The sound is very good for $35 headphones, I do like it a lot.BAD: They DO have a terrible fit & I do not like the adjustment, feels cheap. They fit little bit better if I wear them behind my neck, but they are not designed for it. They are terrible to wear over your head and nothing you can adjust.WILL NOT BUY AGAIN. Go with something different."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"The pieces presented did not do a lot for me. I'm not sure if it was the performance, sound, or if the compositions were that dull. It didn't feel like the performers put their souls into this one. I probably need to listen to other performances by other people, but the music proved so uninteresting I'm not sure if I want to. Sorry!"
4,Great Doc!!!!,"Contrary to the other reviewers I found this documentary quite fascinating. At the end of the day, to have two actual members from The Smiths give an inside look into how things were in their band, it is not going to get any better. We know we will never hear from Morrisey or Marr so, IT IS WHAT IT IS!!! There is also a short interview with Craig Gannon in the extras section. Take it or leave it."
1,disappointed,the overall quality of this item fell short by a long shot when compared to the price paid for it.
1,Bad Screen Technology,"Being a big Sudoku fan, I couldn't wait to receive this as a gift, so I bought it for myself. There is not much difference between the conrast of the grid and numbers to that of the screen. The inability to read the handheld version makes it a waste of money. I promptly repacked mine and returned it to the store.Sudoku puzzles are very Fun so I reccomened you skip the handheld version and buy yourself a book!"
2,This model not recommended,Great idea but more tech development is needed for this version. Screen reflects too much outside light obfuscating the LED numbers. The numbers have low contrast and their improvement is not achieved by the technique suggested to where they can be easily seen. The lines between the groups of 9 square blocks are not prominent enough making block determination difficult. The unit is actually hard to see clearly to be enjoyable to use. I would skip this model and investigate other manufacturers editions.
3,Take your play style to the next level,"I was pleasantly surprised to see this one when a friend gifted me this. It is very attractive and looks cool. All my excitement to explore this toy kinda bit dampened the moment I got the this powered up. It's the display, lack of backlight to be specific. In other words, this won't work in dark. Without the backlight, reflection on the glass is very distracting. In addition, in playing mode, the digital background of the cell indicating the number for unfilled cell also can be distracting. That's why this item gets 3 stars. If one can ignore this inconvenience and get used to this gadget, it's very simple to play.I like the intuitive interface. Stylus based operation is simple. Users can choose different levels for varied levels of difficulty. I found even the basic or level 1 to be not that easy .I look forward to version with a backlight."
4,Enjoyable!,I got this as a gift and really enjoy using it. The backlight is a required feature -- I've only used it twice without that on. I have found all the other features very convenient -- a lot fewer buttons than some models & makes you able to move faster with the stylus. The only thing I'd change is the dividers between the blocks of 9 -- wish they were more distinct.
1,Never used,I purchased this item for a Christmas stocking stuffer and after reading the reviews which were all negitave I will be returning it to the store.
3,Illuminated touch screen sudoku puzzle game,My hubby is addicted to these puzzles and plays them before bed. He prefers the paper books to this electronic game because of the glare on the screen. Like trying to use a calculator with a nightlight.
2,Misused Technology,"Your recorded possible numbers for square(s), using the Notes feature, flash sequentially in each square rather than all being visible simultaneously. Multiple squares flashing possible numbers makes for a literal visual Headache City. This means of visual presentation also significantly, and inappropiately, increases the difficulty in solving the Sudoku.Keep it simple. Buy a Sudoku puzzle book instead. Sudoku should remain a paper-and-pencil puzzle.P.S. I don't understand why such a glaring fault is not mentioned in other reviews."
5,A gift for a friend of mine!!,The touch screen makes it easier for him to play and see. Plus with the pointer it becomes easier to use and play with.
2,Puzzle was not as described,Seller provided a prompt refund. Puzzle was different than described. puzzle was sent with dead battery and was not capable of illumination. It was a childs version of the real thing not even worth having.
3,Great game - small problem,"This is my 2nd one of this Sudoku game and it's enjoyable and durable The only problem is small, but aggravating. It involves the difficulty of changing the batteries. The screw to open the battery compartment is tiny and nearly impossible to get to and turn. Instruction says to use phillips head screwdriver but the screw head is flat so a phillips won't go into it. Straight screwdrivers don't seem to work either, even the tiny ones used for eyeglasses repair. It's highly doubtful that the normal household would have a tool that will work for this screw removal.Batteries have to be changed fairly often, so this is a recurring problem. Mine is not useable now since the batteries need replacing but I'm unable to open the compartment to change them. It's a shame, because other than that it's a great product but it's a shame this issue hasn't been addressed in at least 4 years since I had the same problem with my original one."
2,Too little logic,"Unlike other reviewers, I did not have trouble reading the screen and I thought the touch screen technology was great. I believe the fault with the product was that most of the games could not be completed using logic alone. Guessing was a must to solve the games. If you don't mind guessing this is a good game because the beginner level will blink the number if it is not correct allowing you to guess and then use logic again. Additionally, the timer is a nice feature, especially in that it will let you pause the game and then resume."
1,Very Poor Contrast,It's very difficult to see the screen on this device unless you're in almost total darkness with the light on the device turned on.
4,Good Pastime - Backlight Useful,"I bought this game several years ago. Its useful if you like Sudoku and need to kill some time. I find that the numbers are easy to see if you're using the unit indoors, and also using the backlight. Of course, I bought this two years ago when I turned 40, so to help out a little I also use reading glasses when I'm doing the puzzle.When you add it all up, its a fun way to play Sudoku without having to screw around with writing little numbers in boxes, then constantly erasing them as you rule things out. I mean that's okay at the beach, but who wants eraser debris on your bed if you're solving the puzzles at night?All in all, I can give a strong recommendation for indoor - especially nighttime use."
3,Hard to see.,"This handheld Sudoku game is ok, except I haven't figured out how to save. Need to read instructions. Screen is sometimes hard to see even in indoor light. You need to look at the right angle."
2,"Performance, It does not seem to be working properly.",There seems to be a malfunction. When a number in the lst column or the number 9 id clicked the scren goes blank for about 1 second.This doesn't affect the performance but it is irritating!!
4,Good package,Bought two of these. One for me and one for my grandson.They work well and the beginner level prompt showing an incorrect entryis really helpful. Found the screen visibility was allright except inrather bright light. Once my grandson was familiar with the rules he likeddoing the puzzles but Sudoku may not appeal too much to youngsters as itrequires patience !
2,Illuminated? Suduko,"The so called ""Illumninated"" product does NOT light up.There are also some boxes which will NOT accept a number.Very, very disappointed with this product."
3,light seems to have a short,"i am enjoying this gadget, this does not seem like a toy, it's sudoku a math learning experience. i am disappointed that the light up feature seems to have a short and i have to jiggle it to get it to stay lit."
3,possibility issues,This is a good game but you can't put in multiple possibilities which is need on difficult levels.
5,Best religous western,My mom introduced me to this book about 10 years ago. I recently bought it again because I wore my first one out. I will never get rid of it. To me it is a great book.
3,"A decent summer read, but nothing special.","""A Woman Named Damaris"" did not have a solid plot, and was redundant. It's a decent read, but most of the pages were full of fluff and fillers. I have no idea what it's like, but Damaris' constant thinking that men are drunks started to get to me and at times made me angry. Predictable, as all of Oke's books are, and her endings come so quickly and without elaboration. I ""sorta"" recommend."
5,Awesome!,"I really enjoyed this book! I have read many books by Jannette, and I can remember this one vividly. It deals with orphaned children also, so it is very touching."
5,Never Disappointed with The Chemical Brothers,"I've been waiting for The Chemical Brothers to come out with a live concert on Blu-ray for a long time and ""Don't Think"" does not disappoint! Can't wait for the next one."
5,"Don't think, Buy it","The legendary group, chemical brothers now visualize their sounds with moving pictures as well as audience. This don't think DVD/cd album is an opportunity for people to get an idea on what electronic music is about in future. They are pioneers in this field. I can't wait to get a hold of this album."
1,Even DON'T THINK to buy.,"I've stopped watching it after 15 min. and there are no words to express disappointing. Picture is a matter of taste but sound... is just disgusting, flat and bassless. Seems like this BD was created from some fan's handy phone record dowloaded from YouTube. Wasted money."
1,won't play on ps3,Put the disc in and it won't recognize it under Video on the ps3.You can play the audio versions of the songs but not the full a/v songs.
1,People Watching,"I was really looking forward to this show! I will not watch it again and the only redeeming aspect is it also came with a CD! Obviously a great light show with the music but the film crew always decided to either film too close to see the whole thing, or too far away to see it either! The main focus of the whole DVD was watching the Japanese agape with what we could NOT see!!!! Bad buy!"
2,ACCUSPLIT WRISTWATCH,"Digital display and functions are o.k. However, watch itself is bulky, of cheap construction, and sits very high when wearing. Nowhere on either the watch or packaging is written the place of origin. This wristwatch is not up to typically high Accusplit standards."
2,Accusplit,I have spent a fair amount of time to try to get the stopwatch to work and it is not at all intuitive or easy to use. Even the directions are not that easy to understand.
1,Accusplit A925MXTBL,I am not sure if the watch is the product that I was looking for. My Grandson runs cross country and I was trying to find a timing device that he could use to check his time as he trains. He has not started his summer training at this time so it is hard to tell if he will be able to use it.It is hard to give a good review number to the item as it has not been used yet
5,Perfect industrial music,"The album assualts all previously conceived notions of how an indlustrial album should play, and it did so sucessfully. Catapulting itself into the limelight of industrial megahits, ""Headhunter"", the unarguable stand-out track of the album, will undoubtedly become etched permenantly onto your subconscious. Every other song is equally powerful and memorable, as well, and the several generous remixes tacked onto the end of this EBM masterpiece are quite respectable in their own rights, especially when compared to some of the atrocious remixes that have originated from such over-played bands as Nine Inch Nails. To sum it all up, this is unequivically one of the best techno-dance/ industrial albums you'll ever likely come across, and the price is hard to beat. NOTE: They're presenting a political/religious satire on track 10, correct?"
3,EBM at it's best,"Front By Front is my personal favorite EBM album, but, that's not saying much. Although I do actually like this album, It, for the most part, just sits on my shelf collecting dust with a listening session every now and then. The layers are very structured and simple, but with many layers, a very easy listen overall. This is not for everybody, and after this I recommend picking up a little more challenging of an album a.k.a einsturzende neubauten, throbbing gristle, or skinny puppy..."
2,its ok... for old synth music,"Although I bought this album in about 2003, it didnt stand up my liking and to where music has evolved to. Yes, it has the classic hit, headhunter on it; if you like the song, download it because buying the album wasnt worth one song. I tried and tried to enjoy the cd through and through but it was lacking and I am let down. For BPM music, its real good but is nothing more than late 80's synth music. It may have been revolutionay, it may have been ground breaking, it may have been influential-- but it is a ""has been"" and will stay that way in my eyes. Save your money, buying this is like buying a Lords of Acid cd; its just dated aerobic music."
4,a good album,"Front by Front is a good album; it contains some of the best 242 songs: Until Death, Headhunter (which can be considered 242's hymn of all times) It is a pure EBM album, with the typical not-completely-instrumental songs which made F242 famous, 'Im Rhythmus Bleiben', 'Work', ... De Meyer's voice is clear and better than on any other 242 album, anticipating his good singing on Cobalt 60' Elemental or Twelve. I personally think that blending 'Official Version' with this album would have be a masterpiece; 242 albums have too many instrumentals songs to be masterpieces."
5,Front 242 as good as it gets.,Just started building a cd collection of them because I have loved them since the 80's. All I can say is get the music.
5,Very Good EBM Sounds...,"If you search for a good Ebm sound, Front 242 Sound i think this is the best choice that you can take. This is one of the best Front CD. ""HeadHunter V 1.0"" is the power of EBM music. Listen to it! It's very good Album."
5,This Present Darkness is briliant!!!!,"This book should be made into a movie!! Peretti has skillfully illustrated each human, demon and angel in a way you can really picture exactly they look like. The story line is fantastic the characters are unforgettable and the underlining message is one no christian should be without."
5,Perfect Perspectives!!!!!!!!,"The best part of ""This Present Darkness"" is the fact that Peretti puts 3 Perspectives on it. One from humans, one from angels, and one from the demonic forces. Then, just to put you in awe, he writes a story in the middle that overshadows some of the best secular writers in the entire world. Frank's the man, and he's being used of God. -Gregory"
5,The absolute BEST book EVER written!,"I LOVE this book! It's my favorite book without question! It really gives a new meaning to me of spiritual warfare, an also shows the undeniable power of prayer. Even if you hate to read, read this! I'm sure you'll love it. You can tell I did. I couldn't put it down! I love every one of his books I've ever read.I've NEVER read a book with better descriptions. Read it! You'll LOVE it!"
5,"It's not new, but it's newsworthy","Having been a Christian for a number of years, Spiritual warfare is not a new subject, and this is not a new book, but reading it opened my eyes again, to the reality of Spiritual influence in our everyday living. If you think this book is fiction or exaggerated, think again! This is as real as reality gets!"
5,Frank Peretti's This Present Darkness,See review for Piercing the Darkness. It is the same. There is nothing more I can add to what I have already written.
4,The present darkness,"Great imagery. One man's view of the spiritual warfare taking place all around us. While the story line has some ""cheezey"" story lines, the reality of the battle in our own lives can better be understood after reading this book."
4,Not to be taken literally,An excellent piece of fantasy writing. However its content is not suitable as a basis for any Christian doctrine on spiritual warfare as it goes way beyond what the Bible says on these matters
4,Interesting,"It makes you wonder what is actually going on in the spiritual realm. It also makes one think about ones prayer life.All in all, an enjoyable read!"
3,State of Mind,"I'm only about half way through the book, but I'm enjoying it so far.There are definitely elements of ""Christian cheese"" that make me roll my eyes (i.e. demons are camping out in the University - brainwashing young minds!) BUT I have really appreciated the reminder that there is a spiritual war going on out there. My prayer life has been strengthened and that makes the cheesy parts worth it."
5,A MUST READ!!!! You can't put this one down,"This book literally comes to life in the mind of the reader. The words come to life and you find yourself a part of the story. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll Praise His Almighty Name!!! There aren't enough words to impress upon you how much I encourage you to read this book and also ""Piercing The Darkness"" which is very much like this one including the same powerful Spiritual Warfare Angels such as Tal. Mr. Peretti's other books are fine but not on the level of enthusiasm as these two. HEY MR. PERETTI IF YOU READ THIS HOW ABOUT A THIRD IN THIS SERIES PERHAPS ONE LIKE ""OBLITERATING THE DARKNESS""! Hint Hint"
3,Good fiction... horrid theology,"I enjoyed the book but as a Christian who cares about the bible, I was shocked by the theology of this book. It has almost nothing to do with the bible, yet people seem to take it seriously.I strongly caution Christians (espcially new ones) when reading this book. I also encourage non-Christians to lean what real theologians believe"
2,Very bad source to develop theology on spiritual warfare.,"Very entertaining writing. Very bad source for determining a biblical understanding of spiritual warfare. Case in point, the role of the Holy Spirit is non-existant in the book and yet without the Holy Spirit in our lives we have no ""teacher, comforter, counsellor or guide"". The gifts of the Holy Spirit are absent as well, which requires the ability of the believer or assistance of ministering spirits to accomplish God's work. Stick to scripture for proper understanding of how God works and the Christian response to Him"
3,"Good story, average writing","Peretti's storytelling skills carry the day for this book, and it's a good thing because his writing skills are average. His characters are too predictable - what some people call ""flat"" or ""two dimensional"" - while the jargon and cliches that permeate the conversations grow old quickly. Overall, this was a fairly good novel, but not one that encourages a second reading."
3,A great Saturday book,"Because this is one of Frank Peretti's first books the story is good, but very simple. I'd read this book years ago, but as i re-read (listened to audio) I realized that it is good but basic. Characters are not developed well, and must seemed to me they were in the story just to move it along. However, the book is entertaining and a good one to read when you have a block of time to become immersed in a book that you read just to be reading and relaxing.The strength of this story is that, while I am not sure whether is is strictly Biblical, we are reminded that we do not live in a world where all that is real can be seen. Peretti allows us to use our imagination while we get an idea of the spiritual battles that are taking place on behalf of the believer."
4,Exciting.....but,"After reading the book and reading the other reviews, I found it quit commical that people take reading so seriously. Yes, it was trilling, Yes, it isn't writing on the same plane as Charles Dickens, and Yes, it falls short of conforming to exact biblical specifications that everyone thinks it should have. So what. The book was obviuosly written to entertain not to alter the state of the universe. So just relax,enjoy, and you'll make it through......and maybe even learn something."
2,:(,I didn't like the sound effects. It took away from the the story. I've read This Present Darkness and Loved It...but not the audiobook.
5,Great book! Fiction is a wonderful release!,I love this book and gave me a wonderful release From everyday life. The adventures Peretti took me on opened my eyes to a whole new kind of fiction and gave me something to think about. This book was amazing!!!! I loved the contrast between good and evil and the metaphors were mind blowing!
5,This is a great story!,This is a great story about good and evil and gives the reader the understanding of how these two forces are very real and things are happening that you don't see in this world. God is very real!
5,5th time I have bought this book,Even though this is fiction really feel the author makes a plausible storyline for how angels and demons could interact.I have bought this book at least four times before and lend them out only to have to buy again now this time I can not loose it. LOL
5,An excellent Christian novel,This is the first Christian 'novel' I have ever read. It really brings home the reality of Spiritual warfare and what goes on in the Spiritual realm and how God will use His mighty angels to assist in bringing about His plans and purposes.
5,Realistic look at spirital warfare,No other fiction book I've read gives more insight to the power of prayer. If this book doesn't make the hair on the back of your neck stand up then there's something wrong with your neck. It's biblicly correct and loved by all denominations.
1,Overly metaphorical and slurs non-Christian religions,"Hypes Christianity with an overly-metaphorical 'spiritual' war that can only be resolved through intense prayer. Characters were stereotypical (the good priest; the 'ignores his family' working man; the 'young, good-looking' female reporter; etc.), and women earned their existence by being attractive, good wives, or witches. Treated all non-Christian religions (e.g., Muslim faith; anything new-age; etc.) as demonic. Writing was cliche-ish with overly dramatic swirls. I was hoping for a religious allegory or critique a la C.S. Lewis or James Morrow, but Peretti falls short."
1,Gross Ignorance and scare mongering at it's worst,"This book shows a complete and utter ignorance of the spiritual realm. Worse still, it targets another religon, and makes it out to be evil, and the cause of all the said towns problems. Religious intolerance is the ONLY evil in this book! And I am so grateful to God that the spirit realm is none of the tripe, that this book purports. Nothing is more harmful than ignorance, except for the fear it creates. Surely the burning of innocent people at the stake, in the dark ages, by the church, should have taught us all, that religious ignorance, superstition and fear of the spiritual, only causes pain, suffering, religious wars and death! And then tell me where the real evil lies."
1,A waste of my time,I enjoied the Christian Theme of this book but it was a waste of my time. I did not appreciate the length of this book. The author spent most of his time adding MORE Characters rather than leading to the climax. I do not feel that this book streinghtened my beliefs. I am afraid that i now will judge this author's book negatively just beacuse this book was so poorly written.
1,This book is the WORST i've ever read!!,"This book is soooo terrible! not worth reading AT all! First off, you have this image in your head of this guy and a girl... but Frank gets these people in HIS very own sdtory mixed up.... the genders you never are quite sure of since one is suppose to be a girl, but suddenly changes to ""he says"" ""she says"" crap! Frank get your chacacters sexes' straight before right a book. This was the biggest waist of time in my life to even read a sentance of any of his books! Just absolutely terrible!!!!!!!!!! Read it and waist time and money on something as pathetic as this book, you'll see what i mean."
3,No worse than 'Lord of the RIngs',"So, it's a load of poop! It's still quite entertaining. Obviously right-wing Chritians (as exemplified in the book) are a soft-target, but it's still relatively entertaining. I guess people get rabid about the Christian stuff, but if extremists want to be the muppets who buy anything by another 'christian' then let them waste their money - just get it out of the library (anyone know what a library is???) and have a giggle."
4,Fantastic!,"This is honestly one of the best books I have ever read. It does not get too preachy, which can turn off some readers, but it also reminds believers about the power of prayer. The book as a whole is amazing, with its tale of the ever-present battle of good vs. evil. It is the last 20 pages or so that really caught my breath. These last few pages are extremely powerful. I read this book for the first time a few years ago, and I can vividly recall reading the ending a thousand times, each time being captivated by Peretti's great story-telling techniques. A simply fabulous book. I recommend anyone and everyone to read this book."
5,Wow.,"Wow. That pretty much describes this tense thriller by my favorite author, Frank Peretti. It actually surprised me that this book was written in 1986 - it's not dated at all, and the things that the characters deal with are still very current. This book isn't for sissys - it's at times downright scary (especially for Christians like me who believe that it's all real.) This book is a page-turner - I couldn't put it down. Its fantastic and frighteningly realistic at the same time. I absolutely loved it, both as an enjoyable read and a frightening way of looking at posession, exorcism, and sin."
4,Angelic Forces at Work,"An interesting concept, of which until Peretti has never been written of, to my knowledge. Many a Christian has wondered of the spiritual activity that takes place daily in heaven and earth, and whether this is a true interpretation of the events taking place in the spirit world or not, it does present itself to be very entertaining reading. Peretti's first novel, if I'm not mistaken, and by my judgement, his finest. I have read this book several times, and after each time I walk away with something I never received from it before, while still maintaining a degree of freshness, so as not to become a stale story. More than anything, I must confess that this novel makes the reader think - and I understand that that is a tired cliche at best, but I must strongly contest that it is in fact the case here. Prepare to be stimulated."
3,Pulp fiction confused with theology,"Peretti relies heavily on standard ""thriller"" techniques not to be confused with theology. I am especially botherd by his portrayal of mainline Christians as the tool of the devil. I don't think this is healthy at all for the church or the gospel. The only thing I find more disturbing than Peretti's theology is the evangelical church's response to it. Some say it is a ""revelation from God."" It must be a new revelation because I don't see Peretti's world portrayed in the bible.I am also dumbfounded that people consider this the best book ever written. For me, it's not even close to Dickens, Hemmingway, Bronte, Fitzgerald and other writers of that caliber.Peretti has reminded us of the power of story. A well told story can be more powerful than centuries of systematic theology and biblical studies."
2,Good for Bible school only,"Ok first before any one gets upset I am a not an atheist, attend church, and respect evalgelicals and other faiths. I give this such a low rating because I thought I was getting a novel that was fiction in the realm of the Calling or the Book Of Joby. yes, I liked these two novels I enjoy a well written good vs evil novel. This book was written with not the general audience in line but the bible thumping reader in mind. In the first chapters alone you could tell this. I bought these by quiclky skimming a review of the The Calling by David Mack {Big mistake not to happen again} where a particular reviewer said this book was much better. Luckliy I bought this and another FP novel used. When I recived them they both had bible study group info stamped in them. I still tried them anyway. I belive these are good for the bible study group but not for those looking for a wellw ritten fiction book."
1,"A valiant attempt at writing, but...","I have a great deal of respect for Mr. Peretti's faith, and I admire what he sought to accomplish with the novel. The plot is certainly relevant. However, the characters are as thin as the paper the book is printed on, and the story is told rather clumsily. I understand that he's written much else since this novel first saw publication, so perhaps he's improved. I recommend the novel on content, but not on quality."
4,Lots of evil spirits,This author takes one into the mindset of evil demons and their hidden activities. It takes some hubris to pretend to understand the powers of darkness but Peretti gives it a good go.
5,A Must Read!,"This will make the 4th time that I read this book, but my first in an ebook format. I travel all the time and enjoy the mental break of reading books. If you've not this series by Frank Peretti, then you're missing an amazing tale of possible spiritual realities."
5,Greatest book I have ever read!!,"This is a wonderful, heart-stopping thriller that caught my attention. With every page the truth slowly unfolds of the problem. Ever though no one knows about angels or demons, Peretti puts it in a great perspective. I read this book a year ago and have read it many times. Frank Peretti is a great detailed writer, and I look forward to many other books that he will make. This is a MUST read for anybody that hasn't."
3,This Present Darkness,"This Present Darkness is a ok book in my oppinion. Though it was hard to follow, it had a well thought out plot and had intresting characters and a cool conflict. Overall this book is worth reading and I would suggest it to someone who likes a medium action and intresting, mysterious read."
1,Hate speech disguised as a suspense novel.,"This is a great book if you believe that Buddhists, holistic healers and pretty much anyone other than fundamentalist Christians are in fact Satan and are trying to take over the world. I won't deny Peretti's ability to write and develop page turning suspense, but this is a book you might want to just skip over if you have an IQ of over 70. Books like this are pretty much the most acceptable form of hate speech. So keep that in mind if you find yourself intrigued by the interesting title are dark cover art."
1,Remember . . . it's fiction,"I actually found this to be a nice entertaining book. However, in the years following my first reading of it, I have been surprised how many Christians don't seem to realize that it's fantasy, not reality.It's a cool story, on the level with Star Wars, but it's far from a ""Christian"" book. There is no Biblical basis for much of anything in the book--no reason to believe that demons cause our emotions, or that demons specialize in certain emotions (eg, demons of fear, depression, etc), or that our prayers give angels strength, or much of anything else in the realm that Peretti has created.So while Peretti writes some pretty good sci-fi, I give only one star because his books seem to have the effect (whether intentional or not) of turning people away from real scriptural study and making them think they have experienced a revolutionary spiritual experience by reading a fictional book."
3,"Paranoid, bigoted, but still entertaining.....","I'm a Wiccan, yet I generally don't have a problem with reading Peretti's work. I basically take it in stride like when I'm reading Charles Williams or C.S. Lewis. To be honest, I found this book quite entertaining, and quite thrilling. Unfortunantly, Peretti's ideaology (not theology) is rampant with bigotry and paranoia, with a hatred for individuals like me that seems to burn like that of Hitler towards the jews.However, I still found the book entertaining.Oh, and for all of you Christian reviewers, I read this book, and I STILL practice Wicca. Literature isn't THAT effective, folks."
2,Here they go again...,"Apparently, conservatives bash Hollywood because it doesn't make the RIGHT KIND of simple-minded junk. And guys, please tone down the ""spiritual war"" talk. After centuries of questionable behavior by folks marching in the name of Jesus, the rest of the world gets a little nervous when phrases like that are thrown around."
1,"Awful book, worse theology","I am not sure if the author of this book has ever read the Bible. I can't find the words to describe all the things that are wrong with this book. Another review did a remarkable job. I just wanted to log my vote to show that there are Christians out there that do not believe in this kind of paranoid, racist, conservative propaganda."
5,Awesome Book.....Great Reread,I have read this book before in the past and find it just as exhilarating as I did the first time I read it!
2,"review of ""This Present Darkness""","I bought this for my friend for Christmas, not realizing it was the ""dramatized"" version. She can't stand it. It's scary and very disturbing. I'm so disappointed. Next time I will definitely look deeper at the description of what I'm buying. I read the book and really liked it. She listens to books on cd as she drives. We were both very disappointed at my mistake."
3,Eh...,"My fault. I wanted the book on tape and this ended up being a dramatized version and I was not thrilled. I don't think it was advertised as for what it really was or perhaps I didn't read well enough. Anyway, it was disappointing."
5,Best Christian fiction I've ever read!,"I don't give five stars very often, but this book deserves it! Without a doubt, it's the best Christian fiction I've ever read. The plot is clever and the characters are well-developed. The writing style is excellent. Peretti's unique style sparkles, but never gets in the way of the story.Not everyone will agree with Peretti's interpretation of spiritual warfare (it IS fiction, after all), but his portrayal of the behind-the-scenes battle between angels and demons and their interaction with humans comes across as very believable. Whether you totally agree with Peretti's speculations or not, I believe the Lord has really used him to focus attention on the Bible's often-neglected teaching about spiritual warfare -- sometimes we Christians forget we're in a battle!An epic adventure that entertains as well as edifies and encourages (a little alliteration, there), This Present Darkness is a must read."
5,Excellent story.....provocative subject,"Peretti is an excellent story teller. He also knows how to make a point. I feel that spiritual warfare is overlooked by many Christians. The reader must remember that this is one man's impression of what might be going on. But, I haven't found anything contradictory to scripture in the book. If this book incites curiousity in the reader, then he should look into the area for himself.I think that's what Peretti is after anyway"
4,Covers a lot of ground in a low page count,"Bottom line: A quiet novella that manages to develop a fair-sized cast of characters and develop and resolve a number of thoughtful, respectful internal and external conflicts in only 140+ pages.Trigger warnings: None.How does it treat women/same-sex relationships? Sexism still exists, though women have more ability to move up science/math career ladders than in the present day. Same-sex relationships seem to be generally accepted, though heterosexism still exists (possibly more in older generations than younger?).Does it have explicit sex scenes?: Yes, several, all tied into the story and character development. All are explicit without seeming strained.Would I read it again? Yes, possibly. I would definitely read more by this author.Would I publish it? Yes, though perhaps with some attention to pacing and some questions about the plot resolution."
5,"Wonderful, heartwarming story! A true classic.....","We purchased this book when our son (now 4 years old) was an infant. It was a big hit with him right from the beginning. Now his 18 month old sister is in love with this book. It's the first book she picks at naptime and bedtime, and she even talks about ""Polo"" and ""Pinpin"". This is a wonderful story to share with your children! I like how the author describes the different ways each of the mother animals love their children (much like humans of different religions or different ethnic backgrounds). This is definitely a book that I will keep around in hopes of sharing it with our grandchildren someday."
2,Not for Goddess women,"Though the author tries to draw women in with references to Goddess religion and women's ways of knowing, it is truly written for the woman who hasn't yet begun her ""Goddess journey"" on any level in her life. As a priestess, I was very disappointed in the many references to ""God"" and the negation of Goddess wisdom. The author should have stuck to writing for a patriarchial audience, as matri-focal women will find little value in this."
3,Second Attempt!,"After the utterly diasatrous Elstree Hill release, and me being a bit stubborn, I thought I would try this Desert Island films DVD, thinking it couldn't be worse, quality wise. Well dear reader, it isn't worse, but it ain't good. Very washed out colour, and not great sound. It is watchable however, and if I give the Elstree Hill release 1 out of 10 I would give this 6 out of 10. Hope this makes sense. (I still think for the fact it's poor quality that it is too expensive). (Oh and the film is of course very good. Can some company manage a restored/good quality print...please!!) AW (U/K)"
1,Amazon won't sell it to me.,"I would like to download to buy this movie but Amazon, in its infinite wisdom, doesn't have a version for the Mac - in the 21st century yet. There are a number of other westerns I would like to buy as well, but I can't.Derek"
3,HOPPER THE HERO?,"The ever-present Dennis Hopper plays the hero for a change in this German-made thriller that has some good moments, but still seems a little forced and talky at times. Hopper plays a former Vietnam vet whose protege is killing people in revenge of his young daughter's death probably caused by a nuclear power plant. German actor Heinz Frecke looking like a pumped up Bruce Willis is stoically effective as the ""straight shooter"". The movie attempts to connect the current killings with Frecke's time in Vietnam where he mistakenly killed two children in a raid. While the effect isn't quite as devastating as the writer intended, it still lends some credibility to the script. The movie's abrupt and puzzling ending are a little unsatisfactory, though."
4,Lady Audley's Secret,Very good example of a Victorian novel. I have not read Braddon before. There are many layers to Lady Audley's secret and while the reader figures out the first secret pretty quickly the others layers are revealed slowly and inevitably.I enjoyed the book.
5,"Review the novel, or the edition?","It's unfortunate that opinions regarding the story, Braddon's style, and/or Victorian novels in general make the little star rankings lower for this particular edition. In fact, the edition is quite good; the introduction is superb, the footnotes are very useful for those of us who easily forget our Classical references, and the appendices are chock full of relevant information. Like the story or not, this edition is wonderful."
4,Lady Audley's Secret is Enjoyable if Slow-Paced,"Although a contemporary of both Dickens and Trollope, I found M.E. Braddon's ""sensation novel"" an easy read compared to those two authors, whose works I also enjoy.The book is full of vivid descriptions, hidden identities, secrets and conspiracies hinted at.Young Robert Audley is a laconic and highly unlikely detective.With its gothic foreboding, the plot is telegraphed, and possibly, readers may find the novel too slow for our era of fast-paced mysteries.I enjoyed the book, but felt things might have been wound up a little faster towards the end. Recommended for all lovers of Victorian literature.July 22, 2012: Corrected punctuation."
5,Oldy but a goody,"This was a book I read back in college, and I downloaded it largely because it was free. When I got into it again, though, I recognized that it is an exceptionally good piece of literature. It's engaging, has just the right amount of humor, and draws the reader into the mystery. I highly recommend this one!"
5,Collector's Item for Mystery Fans,"A ""sensation"" thriller which was the rage at the time, Lady Audley's Secret is a must read for the genre fans. It is not ""Gothic "" as it is a mystery. There are no supernatural elements. However, it manages to creat appropriate mood and suspense and builds a web of mystery around its main character. The story is interesting to follow and it is also of interest to note how Braddon comments on the lower and upper classes of England. England of course being the usual location for such mysterious goings-ons! The story was put to the screen on PBS' Mystery Series. Also other good recommendations are The Woman in White and the Wyvern Mystery. Enjoy"
4,an unexpected treat,"As an avid reader of 19th century lit, I am always on the lookout for new (and good) authors of this time period. This book was better than I would have expected. It was well written, and I was drawn into the story right away. While Braddon is not quite as good as Wilkie Collins, she spins a good yarn and keeps you interested. I plan on reading more of her books."
4,Funny and thought provoking.,"Fulghum has had an interesting life. He's been a minister, cowboy, salesman, teacher, writer, and amateur philosopher. This book is a continuation of the anecdotes and fables he so memorably presented us with in ""All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten."" The vignettes are humorous and thought-provoking. In fact, I spent a lot of time staring off into space between them and trying to internalize what I had just read. I was afraid the writing would come off either syrup-y or preachy, but I was pleasantly surprised. I would recommend this book to...anyone, really."
3,Brings a chuckle,"The jack of all trades, Fulghum, says its a continuation of ""All I really need to know I learned in kindergarten"". With his live and let live, universalist world view he shares his observations and opinions of every day life. Each chapter is a short story with a special meaning, and usually brings a chuckle. Many are personal; subjects include: scientific uncertainties, parents, blood, public affection, marriage, religion, lemonade, travel, customs, blessings in disguise, and even yucky stuff----thanks mothers. The book is a good release for every day tension. He is still pondering, ""what is my occupation?""Wish you wellScott"
5,Worth Reading,"This book was witty and insightful, and even though the author is a preacher, he doesn't push his religion on the reader. Very enjoyable and meaningful read. Fun and worthwhile!"
1,A very hard book to read for an animal lover,"Those who love this book are obviously not dog lovers. Fulghum recommends doing like the Thais and eating dogs. He bemoans the amount spent on companion dogs--instead of criticizing the millions spent on pursuits that have nothing to do with loving another creature. Instead of reviling love in the form it takes when we love our dogs, he could have put his energy into eradicating various forms of hate. I was forever discouraged from reading another book by Fulghum, which is too bad, since I think he has a lot of positive messages, too. I just don't get what he hoped to accomplish by that brutal assessment of dogs and those who love them."
2,Plodding story,"I kept reading this story hoping that it was just a slow starter, but, alas it was not to be. This just did not grab me as Mr. King's works normally do."
3,Stephen King at its weirdest!,"Unless you are a die hard fan of Stephen King, you will not like this story. I feel I have to give everything he writes a chance. I am never disappointed, because good or bad it is always interesting, and it entertains me. I may have to read this particular story one more time to really get it. So I probably will."
2,I like a story to have an ending.,"Don't get me wrong, Stephen King is my favorite author. I'd read his shopping list. But no matter how well something is written, I like it to have an ending."
2,dolorado kid,"I was disappointed that the book did not clear up the mystery or connection to the tv series ""Haven"" . It was not a usual Stephen King book."
3,Mystery,"An excellent coffee table book. However, to quote the story - if you are looking for a beginning, middle, and end, you WON'T find that here. The idea behind the story is the story itself; not the denouement."
1,Check the facts,"I didn't like this book from the point when one character refers to American Idol. Later in the book characters refer to Blockbuster and Starbucks. That got me to thinking, were Blockbuster and Starbucks even around in 1980 (and in Denver)? So I went to each company's website. Starbucks was not in Denver in 1980 and Blockbuster was started after 1980 in Texas. So, besides the fact that I hate when books refer to name brands or TV shows unnecessarily, the author should at least check his facts."
1,"A bad read, spoiled","Reading The Colorado Kid is like watching a porno and having the money shots edited out. When I first sat down to read it, the typeface was so big I wondered if it had been written for 4th-graders. That, the skimpy length, and the worst ending of about any book I've ever read easily make this King's worst, as well as that of Hard Case Crime.King thinks he is being clever, but really he could have just put THE END on page 78 instead of page 186 and saved us all a bunch of trouble. It certainly would not have affected the story any."
4,Mystery not horror,"For this Stephen King book, you must remember this is a mystery book, not the typical King horror novel. With that aside... King takes his crack at the old 50s style pulp fiction mysteries with this book. The writing is well done and the story moves along nicely as it is really a conversation between three people that are recounting an unsolved mystery with a body known as the Colorado Kid. As a mystery book it is well paced and slightly reminiscent of the story telling put forth in ""Dolores Clairbourne"" by King. Typical readers will get frustrated with the unresolved ending but that's why it's a mystery and not a horror novel. Don't expect werewolves, vampires, or UFOs and you will be just fine and enjoy the actual text of the book."
3,Don't expect thrills,"I enjoyed this short story, but it was light on the usual Stephen King surprises and excitement. It is a quick read and held my interest, but the ending was a bit unsatisfying."
3,the Colorado Kid,"I enjoy Kings writing style but the ending was quite a surprise. His build up was great, and one expected a grand flourish which never came."
4,Better than I'd expected...,"and it's really cool to polish off a good story in a few hours.Having said that, I miss the days when Stephen King ""meant"" horror. I read ""Salem's Lot"", ""Night Shift"", ""The Shining"", etc. with the lights on, late at night and absolutely loved being terrified and would tell my friends: ""You've GOT to READ THIS!!"". It would be great to see him return to that kind of form."
1,A big disappointment,"The Dark Tower saga are my favorite novels ever, especially Dark Tower 4. The Colorado Kid just plain stinks. Big waste of time. Slightly better than From a Buick 8 (cause it is shorter)."
3,A quick read to kill an afternoon...,"I pre-ordered this book several months before it came out, then when it arrived from amazon.com I let it lay around the house for a while before I read it. I read the first 15 or so pages several times as I made different attempts to get into the book. Once I managed to get past the character development and plot development the story kind of hooked me and I finished the book in one afternoon. Although it was hard to get into, I enjoyed this quick little story. It met my expectations, after all you can not really expect much from only 184 pages."
1,Waste of trees,"I love reading, but after reading this book I will NEVER read another Stephen King book again. I like my to have the mystery solved at the end. Did King even write this book??? If he did, he put zero effort into it."
3,The Colorado Kid by Stephen King,"This book was a gift for my husband. According to his insight, it held an unusual Stephen King presentation of an unsolveable crime. The book was quick reading. After the TV series, Haven, was on, he was curious as to the reference of The Colorado Kid. The book set up the basis for the odd occuring mysteries going on in the Maine harbor town. The book was not action-packed, but a mystery to be solved."
2,not the best of King!,"I bought this book because of the TV series. I enjoy the TV series, but did not enjoy the book. While the characters were interesting, the story was not compelling and there was no conclusion. There are many better choices when it comes to Stephen King's books. I am a very avid King reader, and enjoy almost all of his books (except the Dark Tower series). Just my opinion of course, but I don't feel that this is a good example of his work."
3,Good Story - hard to understand narration,"This is a darn good tale, spun by Stephen King, the best of the story tellers. The basic premise revolves around a body found on the beach by some locals on the way to school. The more bits and pieces that's learned about the corpse the deeper the mystery becomes. I have no problem with the story but the story teller is another matter.Jeffrey DeMunn is basically a good narrator but in this story he just tries too hard to capture the ""down east"" accent of Maine which results in a difficult to understand telling. Maybe if he wasn't so good at what he does, the audio edition of The Colorado Kid would be better.All in all, this is a good story if you're willing to invest the energy in translating Maine to English. bg"
2,Wasted Time,"King wrote this story as a vehicle to say that some mysteries have no conclusion. Fine, but those are the ones that don't become novels. The result is simply the impression that King copped out and just rambled on without knowing how to end this thing.The three characters are ok but can't contend with the pointless ending.Be warned, read the description and understand that the question asked on the cover does have an answer and that answer is NO."
1,A 180 page conversation about a mystery with no solution,"First of all, I've read 10 books in the Hard Case Crime series and loved all of them except this one. I have also read all of Stephen King's novels up through ""Misery"". This is by far his worst book, judging by the ones I've read, and the worst entry in this series. If you're reading the Hard Case Crime series you might want to read this one to complete it, but it's a disappointment. Hope I'm not giving too much away, but the entire book is one conversation between three people about a mystery - if there had at least been a solution to the mystery at the end that would have been something. The mystery is uninteresting as it is - even more so without an answer."
3,Haven A Better TV Show Than This Book,"In my whole life I have always liked books better than their film or teleplay counterparts. However, for the first time the book feel very far from the Teleplay Haven that is presented on the SyFy network. Haven is supposed to based off this book, but I can find minimal similarities except that the show is in Maine, the characters have some of the same names, etc. The book is speculative, leaves room for major error and is hard to believe. A Colorado man has X amount of time within one day to get to an island off Maine's coast where he is found dead.The elderly newspaper reporters speculate how he could have gotten there with their intern of several months. Speculative fiction for a formulaic writer like King just doesn't work. I read the book in a few hours and was sadly disappointed.@krautgrrl recommends watching Haven instead of reading this shallow book."
2,What was the point of this book?,"As usual, Stephen King creates a good set of characters. However this is a mystery that doesn't have an ending. I guess that King was trying to experiment with this book, so I will give him 2 stars for effort. However, the experiment didn't work. Unless you are a fast reader who doesn't mind killing a few hours reading this book I wouldn't even try to read it. Slow readers may wish to ask Stephen King to return the day that they wasted reading this book."
3,"Not pulp, in the traditional sense","I predict that there are two types of people who read this book. King describes it as a 'love it or hate it' breakdown, but I suspect it's a division between those who at least fight the urge to continue to work on this story (do some internet research to check on the weather that day, see if there's any traditional significance to the Russian coin, whatever), and those who just put the book down in frustration.This isn't at all what I was suspecting -- no guns, no dames, no morally-immature gunsels making threats bigger than their hatsize -- but I actually liked it more for that. It's a story about stories and the people who tell them, about journalism that's never seen a television camera.I finished reading this about 12 hours ago, and I keep mulling it over, like a smooth rock in my pocket. King invites the reader to write his own story around this framework, without any of the reassuring ""mustabeen""s that would make us feel we were correct. Nice job."
1,Self-indulgent garbage,"Once a constant reader and avid Stephen King fan, I vowed never to pick up another Stephen King book after his horrid and self-indulgent conclusion to The Dark Tower saga.But then I had a 5 hour layover and saw this book, so what the hey...Terrible lazy and sloppy work. The other negative reviews already say it all (come on, a Blockbuster or Starbucks in 1980?) And is anyone else completely sick of ""Ahuh""? Gag. Garbage like this would never see light of day except for the power of King's name and his previous works.I won't make the same mistake in buying a Stephen King book again - or at least not until I check out the Amazon reviews!"
3,Primarily a character study,"As the author says, some will love this book and some will dislike it. It is essentially a study of three characters, two veteran newsmen mulling over an odd occurence with a young intern. The story's focus is really on their interplay and not on the ""mystery"". If you are looking for suspense or a gripping read, this is not your book."
3,Not quite a typical Stephen King Novel!,"I am a huge Stephen King...however I was very disappointed with this novel. It lacks the vivid imagery and intricate character portrayals typical of the King.I was very impressed with ""Rose Madder"", ""Needful Things"",and even ""The cell"" - these novels tantalized my imagination and made me hunger for more.....but the ""The Colorado Kid"" was quite boring in comparison. I was actually glad when I finished lol! Sorry Stephen! In Jamaican terminology...."" Wheel and come again"""
3,The Colorado Kid,"I love a lot of Stephen Kings Material. This however was not a great book. it was interesting, but did not really peak my intrest. I only finished reading it cause I paid for it and hoped it would turn it self around. Like I said it is an ok book just not my taste I still gave it 3 stars, Cause i liked it. Just not as good as i thought it would be. I have heard others say it is a really great book, so it really just depends on if it grabs your attention."
2,Waste of Time,"I'm not the only reviewer to write this, so it's not much of a spoiler, but I cannot stand when I invest time in a book to have NOTHING solved in the end.I read this book because my husband and I have become fans of the summer SyFy series Haven, and the credits state that it's based on this book. I'm not sure how--the series isn't over yet, so I'm assuming that the case that somehow involves Audrey's mom is the Colorado Kid story, but that's the only connection I've found between the book and the television show.The book comes across as amateurish--definitely not the style readers have come to expect from Stephen King. I was hooked through most of it too, because it is quite interesting and kept me guessing as to what had happened. But then...no delivery. The reader is never given the conclusion and wrap-up. I know that is how the author wanted it, but I am all about closure and can't stand open-ended interpretation. Bleah."
2,"""Colorado Kid""- the Anti-Mystery ?","If ever a book could be called an ""Anti-Mystery"", it's ""The Colorado Kid"". At the end of the mystery, the detectives are still as baffled as when they started. There are enough unsolved mysteries in real life, we don't need fictional ones. I thought part of the fun of mystery novels is that the detective solves them in the end, ""The Colorado Kid"" doesn't do that plus there was no ""mutant of the Week"" as in the "" Haven"" TV series that is supposedly based on this book."
3,The Colorado Kid,It was not up to the usual Steven King novels It was kind of slow and hard to stay interested.
2,"Stephen King, Please finish the story!","I know all books start out boring. The author needs to set up the characters.In this book the entire first chapter is a waste of time. In the book two oldmen tell a story to a young secretary and in the story that they tell leavesmore questions than answers. Stephan King got off to a good start and I wouldgive 5 stars if the author answered all those questions. I have read otherHard Case Crime books and most of them are good, so try one of those instead."
3,The first disappointment.,"I love Stephen King's writing. His writing in this book is great, but the story does not deliver a solid mystery that you'll be happy with.The charachters are interesting, and the story seems to be going somewhere, but in the end ...well lets just say there is no end.Maybe that is the creative mind of the Great Stephen King. Maybe he did this for some strange reason, maybe fifty years from now someone will find hidden clues within the story that will make us look at this story differntly. But perhaps not.Nonetheless ...it's a quick read, a good beach book."
2,Book doesn't have an ending...pure and simple,"Stephen King tries to justify why he doesn't have an ending by explaining the theory of newspaper reporting.Unfrotunately, this is a novel, and he needs an ending.King fanatics will no doubt find a way to call this brilliant storytelling and call the rest of us morons for wanting everything wrapped up in a nice bow.But the best mysteries are the ones where an impossible situation is set up and the resolution explains all, or at least enough to make us say ""Wow!""All I said was ""huh?""I haven't really liked anything by him since ""The Green Mile"", so factor that into this review."
2,Colorado kid,The book was OK but not really a typical Stephen King novel. I had high expectations due to the TV show Haven but I was a little disappointed. Not enough wierd things happening I guess.
3,Great King Narrative - Not So Hot Story,"As an avid King fan, I bought this book to complete my collection. I found that it is essentially King in how the narrative flows so simply and how the reading is so easy. I was immediately caught up in the story being told and had a strong affinity for the characters after just a few pages, which is a typical King quality that I enjoy in his books. The book is a very short read, and thoroughly enjoyable, except for the ending. You'll have to read it to see what you think, but I was a bit disappointed.With the caveat about the ending, I would still recommend the book."
1,dissappointed,"Keep your money for something else. I persevered till about half way through the book, but I gave up. After reading 11.22.63 I find it hard to believe they are from the same author."
1,Colorado kid,"I am big fan of king, I was disappointed in this read. King wrote at the end something like, either you like it or you don't. The whole time I was reading, I was wondering where is this story going?"
1,What A Yawn--Is King Even Trying Here?,"No Grit...No Teeth...No Real Mystery... Nothing Noir...How was this book even remotely relevant to the publisher, Hard Case Crime? It wasn't ""Hard"" when stereotypical New England duffers recount quaint and whimsically in their safe little newspaper offices the tale. And a ""Crime"" was never established. No danger... No peril...It was long on characterization, short on plot. And gripping plot and action is what sparks life in good mysteries--not King's folksiness. This isn't a new genre, or something ground-breaking, it seems to be exploring a self-indulgent fancy.I count The Green Mile as one of my all-time favorites, but this was a real disappointment. Hope his career doesn't end on this sad note"
2,The Anti-Mystery Story,"This was the first Hard Case publication book that I have tried. It won't be the last, but I was hardly impressed with King's story.I don't so much mind having a story with no ending (I got the point even without the author's afterword that was obviously meant to propitiate his regular readers who he correctly feared would be disappointed by this latest work), but couldn't King have given more of a mystery? That is, after all, what is expected of a crime-mystery book. I can't believe that I was asking too much. Instead, I was treated to 178 pages of ""Welcome to Maine!"""
1,"If you're interested because of ""Haven"", forget it.","I bought this book because the television program ""Haven"" is based upon it. The word ""based"" should be preceded by the words ""Incredibly vaguely"". Two characters names and occupations are about the only things in common.Then, the book itself doesn't tell a story. It sets up a mystery, and by King's own admission, it's about HAVING a mystery, rather than SOLVING one. It was extremely short for the price, and I felt completely revolted at having spent ANY money on it."
4,"Interesting, but not what I expected","I have seen a few Stephen King movies and I love the ""Haven"" series based on the Colorado Kid so I figured I would read the book. I would have to say the series is loosely based on the story; the book tells about who the Colorado Kid was and possibly how he ended up in Maine, with a lot of speculation and what if? compared to the series which is more about the character Audrey and how she helps the ""troubled""--not mentioned in the Colorado Kid. A good read, just not what I expected based on the ""Haven"" series."
3,Colorado Kid,"This is a good read especially if you're following the TV show, ""Haven"", which is supposedly based on this novel. While I realize the TV show is based on the writer's idea of what might have followed this book, I think the TV show has gone too far in interpreting the results of the book."
2,Disappointed,I was really disappointed in this story. I expected more from Stephen King. I like stories with an ending whether good or not.
5,Thought provoking mystery,"Couldn't put this down. I began reading this to try making sense of the tv series it inspired. I was not disappointed. If you love a good mystery, you will enjoy The Colorado Kid."
3,The Colorado Kitd,"This was a book of Stephen Kings that I had never read before, but with the TV show Haven, that refers to this book, I thought I would give it a try.I thought the book was very much a Stephen King story, giving you answer and more questions while moving you through this Story of the Kid. You end up thinking about the TV show and the troubles and how the Kid was involved."
3,"Fun Quick read, nothing to do with the TV Show Haven","Fun Quick read, nothing to do with the TV Show Haven. I enjoyed the book on it's own. I had some expectation that it would have something in common with the TV show on SyFy Haven. They mention that its based on the story all the time. The newspaper guys are there thats it. So have fun with a classic Stephen King book where beautiful Maine is a central character. Don't expect the book to turn into the TV show as you get to the end."
3,So far so good,So far so good.Although a little hard to follow with all the backwards English.Reading this book to understand the background of the TV series Haven.
4,Nothing like haven,I watch the tv show haven. I wanted answers to the show. But this book gives u none. One has nothing to do with the other. Haven is just based on this book. But I really enjoyed the read. It was a good mystery.
2,Not the show,I got this because I watch the series Haven on television. It was supposed to be based on this book. Don't see it at all! Disappointed.
2,Okay,Good but thin for the money.The. Kindle books bear close inspection before buying. I will look closer in the future.
2,Review of The Colorado Kid,"I purchased this book to get a possible insight as to the plot of ""Haven,"" which I enjoy. I can see how Haven is based on the book, but there was no resemblance to the storyline. I am also one of those who likes the mystery to be explained, and The Colorado Kid just leaves you hanging."
3,Story good... Ending bad,"I was very much into the story. I feel it was well written and the characters were very well developed, as is always the case with Stephen King. I was held by the story and actually read through the book extremely quickly as I was ""sucked into"" the story completely. The only really problem I have is the ending. It seems Mr. King has come to the point in his life where he doesn't mind leaving things untied in his stories. He would chastise me for saying this as someone who doesn't understand or who puts too much stock in the ending instead of the journey getting there. Maybe so, but I still like to have endings a little neater than what we get from this book. I am not going to go into details and provide spoilers for it, but I was disappointed upon reaching the last page with where I was left by this ending."
2,not worth the read,"I bought this book based on the fact that the Haven TV show is loosely based on it. Boy was I disappointed. Only thing I can see it copies is the two old newspaper men. Besides that let down, the mystery in the book is never solved. As far as I am concerned, this was a totally bad purchase."
1,Self-Indulgent Tripe,"I know Stephen King loves the pulp genre; so do I. The difference is that I didn't slap together half a novella and try to cash in on pulp's recent resurgence. King did.When King is good he's very good, but when he's bad he's self-indulgent and maddening. The Colorado Kid is an example of the latter. Three overly cutesy, annoyingly precious two-dimensional characters chug tea, cokes and coffee while recounting a not-very-interesting ""mystery"" from years ago: a man is found dead (he choked on a sandwich) and no one is sure why he was at the spot where he was found dead.The resolution? There is none. None.King just sets up the ""mystery""--what little there is of it--and then types THE END. In a five-page afterword King explains that the story was meant to illustrate that we all live in ""a web of mystery.""Oh brother."
3,The mystery of this mystery,"I just finished this book and I have more questions now than I did before getting started.Told with his usual flair for realistic dialog, King keeps you interested the whole time. However, when everything is said and done, you have to wonder why you ever allowed yourself to get involved.I'm a huge fan of his work, and this is the most let down I've been yet. I can see what he was going for, but in the end, you just feel ripped off."
4,Mystery Fans Take Note,A good solid read from Stephen King in a different line then his usual horror stories. The book is escapist fare that leaves the reader quite satisfied.
3,The Colorado Kid,"A fast, one-day read. It isn't his best, or even his second-best, but if you love Stephen King, you have to read it."
2,dissapointed,"I felt SK was just experimenting again, but it did leave me (a devotee) dissapointed. It wont stop me from reading his future books though. He's dissapointed me before, but I keep coming back. It is good story up until it just ""stops"" being told."
1,Skip this one,"The ending of this book is definitely unsatisfying. Isn't the ending the most important part of a mystery novel? Some of King's stuff, I love. SomeI do not. This one did not do it for me."
2,Disappointed with no ending,"I don't recall ever reading a book that did not solve the mystery.... It was disappointing, to say the least, with a lot of facts, mysteries and speculations, to just come an ending that is not really an ending...just completely STOP."
2,The Colorado Kid,"This book was a real disappointment compared to the TV program, Haven, which is supposedly inspired by The Colorado Kid. The TV program is 100% more interesting."
4,"Liked it, but nothing like Haven","I liked this story immensely; the open ending made me keep thinking about it long after I was done reading. My main thought is about why are we so sure the Colorado Kid took the ferry at all? The ferryman was said to have a drinking problem, so his placing of him on the ferry at all is suspect, and if he could have chartered his own plane, couldn't he have chartered his own boat? :)That being said, I specifically bought this because I love the show Haven and the credits say it is based on this story. How? The newspaper men exist in the show- barely, the bar is called the Grey Gull, and there is a picture of the Colorado Kid- that's about where the similarities end, so if you are looking for a story about ""the troubles,"" etc. you won't find it here."
3,"Not Haven, but enjoyable","In case you're wondering, this has barely anything to do with Haven (the tv show which is supposed to be based upon this story). Regardless, I enjoyed the story."
2,Roman-a-clef-sans-clef,"I'll admit, I've never been a Stephen King fan. But I think anyone who reads this would have to agree that without his name on the manuscript, this would've jumped from the slush pile to the recycle bin in a matter of minutes.It's really a short story padded to much greater length, sort of like an egg roll that's stuffed with nothing but cabbage. But what the heck; at least 90% of business books are guilty of that. What really irked me about this book is its outright laziness--aside from leaving the puzzle unsolved, there are some glaring anachronisms that even a junior editor should've caught.Overall, I get the impression that I've put more effort into writing this review than The Great Stephen King put into writing this book. Very disappointing, especially when contrasted with some of the other (older) entries in the Hard Case Crime series. Buy it if you must, but don't say you weren't warned."
1,Dry,"Though the story was interesting, this was a rather dry read and not what I expected from one of my favorite authors."
4,Different than I expected,"I'll admit, I only got curious enough to buy this book because I'm a fan of the Syfy show, Haven. If you're expecting anything about Audrey Parker, the Troubles, or even a town called Haven, you won't find it in this book.While it was a bit of a shock to realize just how much artistic liberty the writers of Haven took for their show that's ""based on"" The Colorado Kid, it was still a really good book. Definitely worth buying."
4,An interesting mystery that purposefully lacks a resolution,"This was an interesting mystery story that purposely leaves the reader with questions. Throughout the book King (through his characters) warns the readers that there is no solution provided to this mystery. The lack of resolution didn't bother me, though the constant references to that lack of resolution by the characters tended to get annoying the further I got into the story."
1,Not Very Good,"I was expecting more from Steven King. I bought this because I like the TV show ""Haven"" and it was suppose to be based on this book. I was really disappointed because I thought it would give more of a background of the show, but I guess Hollywood made it more than it really was."
2,Nothing like Haven,"I love the Haven series. I bought this hoping it would give me more of a backstory and details of the town and the characters but I was so wrong. I normally like King's work, but this failed me in every way. The show's disclaimer should state, instead of ""Based on The Colorado Kid,"" ""This novel contains two of the characters and a reference to the title character, but otherwise has nothing to do with the TV series.""Now I understand why, in spite of a successful TV show, the book was not reprinted. The owner did not want to field complaints from hundreds of thousands of disappointed buyers.If you have never seen ""Haven,"" and are a Stephen King completist, then this is a worthy addition. But do not in any way assume that the two complement each other. If I could resell an E-book I would sell this one. Or donate it to the Goodwill."
3,The Colorado Kid -- a bit on the dull side,"Kind of a nothing story. Vaguely interesting, but not too exciting. I don't mind that nothing was really explained. What I mind is that it didn't hold my interest.I was interested to see how closely the Sy Fy series ""Haven"" was based on this story. Turned out that any similarity was purely coincidental. The series is reasonably interesting. The story"
3,Colorado Kid,Rather discolored and scent??? I would rate this as just average. You get what you pay for. This is normal for this dollar value.
1,"I don't usually pile on, but this was awful.","If anyone else but Stephen King wrote this book, it never would have seen print. It moves at a painfully slow pace, its characters are cardboard cutouts with no plausibility at all, and, worst of all, its ""big surprise"" is that it gives NO solution to the mystery it proposes. The cover has nothing to do with the book, and sadly the cover is by far the best part.I will try another volume in this publisher's series, but Stephen King should be ashamed of himself. And his lame and badly-written ""Afterword"" does nothing to justify this book's existence at all."
1,Save your time and money,"Don't get me wrong ... I'm a long-time fan of both crime fiction and Stephen King, so this novel looked like a sure thing to me! After reading it, however, I feel less like a fan and more like a victim of a practical joke. In my opinion, this is not a novel -- it's a piece of a manuscript that King should have kept in his desk drawer until he was ready to finish it.He sets up a nifty puzzle, then writes, apparently, until he reaches the minimum word count required by contract, then simply stops. After that, he has the gall to justify it in an afterword, explaining that an unsolved mystery is a metaphor for The Great Mystery of Life.That's all very well, if it's what King wants to do. But it should never have been published under the Hard Case imprint, which leads bookbuyers to expect a tale that adheres to the conventions of the pulp crime genre."
3,Colorado Kid,"I'm not completely done with it yet, but it's OK so far. I should finish the book tonight. I wanted to read it because of the TV show ""Haven""."
2,The Return of Stephen King...Sort Of,"This ""novel"" was the first release for King after his mini-retirement. Since it's part of a ""hard case crime"" series with a fantastic retro-pulp cover, you wouldn't be wrong to expect hard boiled crime...executed with King's immutable style. After the first two chapters don't go anywhere, however, you realize that this is really just a short story exercise for King that never picks up speed. In fact, King says as much in his afterword: This book is a meditation on unsolved mystery. There's no crime, no sex, and no tension--all of which makes for a maddening pulp fiction book."
1,bummer,This is not one of Stephen's best books. It was too short to build any kind of storyline or get you that involved with the characters..dissappointment for me..
3,Makes you go hmmmmm,"Interesting short story.... I quite enjoyed it. I think maybe what you learn here, is my reason for not reading or watching the news ! I love the little old men in this story. It's short so my review is short to not give anything away. I liked the afterword from Stephen as well."
1,Disappointed,"The MASTER has fallen on this one. The characters were not his usual, rich, colorfully developed crew. Almost like he scribbled this at a stop light."
4,Thought provoking story,"Delightful story. It sets up an improbable situation and then ends, giving you no explanation. You are free to imagine your own solution to the mystery. Not King's usual thriller, but good nontheless. To add to the fun, the cover of the book offers no insight into what the story is about."
3,Good Characters,"For a Stephen King Book this had so much to desire. He is an excellent writer, and he didn't fail in his writing here. It was a story that could have went so far, but didn't. I realize that was the whole point, real mysteries are often left hanging. But when you read a Stephen King Book you exoect certain things and this book had none of those things. I was disappointed."
2,Not enough meat to the story!,"Stephen King makes a bold statement in this book's afterward. He claims that readers will either love this or hate it. While I didn't hate it, King is capable of so much more. The reasons he gives for loving/hating it didn't apply to me though. Basically we're given an odd mystery and the answers are hard to come by. I think the book would've been better served with more extended flashbacks to the time of the original mystery. Overall, it was too quick and mundane for me."
3,Not an expected mystery,"I'm not sure how many stars to give this book. It isn't the mystery story I thought it would be. In fact, it shouldn't be a Hard Crime book. It has some interesting things, however. Nothing is solved. We learn the identity of the stranger is who was found dead on a beach, but nothing really about him.The cover of this book is misleading. Better it was a beach scene with an empty litter basket on it! There is no sexy broad in the story."
3,Buick 8 Redux,"Another reviewer wrote, ""What King doesn't explain is more important than what he does explain. Like his last great novel, FROM A BUICK 8, this book is about the mysteries that don't have easy answers.""And therein lies the problem. I've seen precisely this before -- just a handful of years ago in From A Buick 8. There is nothing new here. Not only is the theme nearly identical, but it's presented in the same fashion too -- through the words of the prototypical King ""geezer.""It's a well written, fast paced read. King always is. It's just not much of a story, and it's nothing that anyone who's read Buick 8 hasn't read before."
3,A horse of a different color,"For some reason I can't figure out Stephen (he is my God) King has decided to write some kind of pulp fiction sort of novel. It doesn't work. He's a great writer, but this is not his genre. Not by a long stretch.He has written good mysteries before, though. Shawshank Redemption was terrific. But this one just kind of sits there."
2,"Steven KIng, yes; Hard Case Crime, no.","Let me start by saying that I LIKE Steven King. I have read everything he has ever written, starting with Salem's Lot years ago, and this is vintage Steven King. The two old geezers in Colorado Kid could easily have been transplanted from Milt Crossen's store in Salem's Lot.The problem is that this was not supposed to be vintage Steven King, it was supposed to be vintage pulp fiction. The pulp fiction genre is clearly defined by the likes of Donald Hamilton's Matt Helm and Micky Spilane's Mike Hammer and, even back before that by every rawhide-tough cowboy that ever graced a Louis L'Amour western.So, if you sat down to read a Steven King book, you got up satisfied, but if you sat down to read a pulp fiction novel... well, then you got up disappointed. Too much Steven King, not enough pulp fiction."
2,Audio book version is impossible,Reader is trying to impress us with his completely fake and awful accent. the story is lost along with have the letters in the American language.
4,A good read by a great story teller.,"Stephen King can plain ol' write. He could write a story about paint drying and I would prolly enjoy it.This book is a neat little piece of work. Don't expect it to be Kings best, but it is interesting and fun. It leaves you with a lot to think about, which says quite a bit considering what a short little book it is.Oh yeah, and that cover is just Freaking Awesome."
4,interesting,The book keeps you hooked on the story wanting to know what happens next.... I am not disappointed in the ending
2,Quite boring,This was my first Stephen King book and it was not what I expected. Very slow and drawn out in the beginning. I didn't like the format it was written.I get the impression that this is not how Stephen King normally writes. It wouldn't put me off reading other .books he has written.
3,"Interesting, Somewhat. Meh.","I, as other reviewers, read this because of its much-touted connection to the SyFy show, ""Haven""; I am not sorry I read it, but it is definitely NOT gripping, hard-crime fiction. I am not a big horror fan so have not read much Stephen King; I have little basis for comparison to his other works. Without the connection to the television show, I would not have read this at all. I read the ""Afterward"" FIRST, which prevented my total disgust by the end of the actual story! Without the prior knowledge, I would have probably burned the book. More questions about the titular character were raised than answered. I was able to enjoy the interplay between the characters, because that's all the book was. I am not polarized about the story, just ""meh""."
1,No Story Line,"I really hated this book.I hate Stephen King's writing, in general, but the book has no plot line. It's like a description of a day in which nothing happens...And in the afterward, King even says he thinks lots of people will probably hate it.So disappointing."
4,Colorado Kid Review,I chose this book because I watch the weekly T.V show Haven which is based on Stephen King's Colorado Kid.I couldn't put it down and I loved the way it ended.
3,Cliff Hanger,I normally dont read Stephen King novels so this was a first for me. I book did keep my attention but I was never sure where the author was going with the story line. Then the way he finished the book was a cliff hanger. There was no answers to the story line. He left you hanging like he might write another book.I was told that this book is what the TV series Haven was based on. Personally I dont see it other than the name of the missing person is The Colorado Kid.It one of those books where you need to read it for yourself in order to make an opinion.
4,A change of pace for King,"I looked quite a while to find, ""The Colorado Kid."" It was out of print (already?) and I eventually found it here. I follow ""Haven"": on the Syfy channel, and it's based on this book. Reading it answered a few questions I had."
3,Well....,I gave it 3 stars for now because although I enjoyed... I am not entirely sure WHY I enjoyed it. I love the mystery... but I hate not being able to figure it out.
1,Boring,Just thought it was short and boring. I do not reccomend it for anyone. Only read it because Haven is based off of it. But it's not so much.
1,The Colorado Kid,"I don't know if this book is a good read or not. It is written in German!!! And the necessity for rating is 0 stars for that reason, although it is marked with one star. I enjoy the television series ""Haven,"" so was interested to see what the book was like. However, I speak mitt English."
3,It's pretty good for a short story,"I read this one since I like the show Haven. Not sure how exactly they tie together. The story was pretty good, but left me wanting some closure at the end."
3,Interesting,I was looking to see how this might tie into the TV show Haven. As far as I read it really doesn't but was still interesting.
1,Deceiving,"The most disappointing book that I've read in a very long time. I know that one shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, but this one was highly deceiving. By the title, the cover and the description, I thought that Steve King was writing a pulp mystery novel. He certainly didn't do that.What he wrote was a very long drawn out, sermonizing, story with one dimensional characters that one didn't care about who were telling a long, drawn out story that didn't go any where.Granted, some of the early pulp mysteries had one dimensional characters and no plots; however, those are not the stories that we remember from the Golden Age of Mystery.Mr. King didn't do this small press any favors when he wrote this book. I certainly won't be interested in anything else in their line."
2,Haven,I brought this book on my Kindle because of the show Haven...I am also a Stephen King fan...for the most part...the story was just ok and I didn't find it had much if anything to do with the SciFi series...if that is why you want to read this..do not waste your time...it really isn't worth the seven or eight bucks...
5,Very Stephen Kingish,"Since the show ""Haven"" first aired I have been trying to find a copy of the story on which it was based. I have to say I was not disappointed. It is as eerie as the show and as with a lot of Mr. King's work, it leaves you with more questions than answers. If you haven't read it or seen ""Haven"", I heartedly reccommend both. But if you are not a King fan, maybe you won't get it. LOL"
1,a complete waste of time,"I have no problems with a story that has questions unanswered. As a matter of fact, the story of The Colorado Kid is an intriguing one. If executed properly, it would make a wonderful addition to the new Pulp series. However, the execution is frightfully dreadful. The whole setup, with the two jolly old guys and the wide-eyed intern, is embarrassingly contrived. I literally cringed at many parts of the story. After writing so many books that range anywhere from mediocre to brilliant, it's amazing that Stephen King is still capable of writing something that's so reminiscent of a high school sophomore's first attempt at novel writing. I read this book on a flight from Washington DC to Southern California, I wish I had opted the in-flight movie instead."
2,"double-barreled boredom, ayuh","Three characters. One room. And not one bloody thing happens.At times this book feels like an endless one act play starring Ye Small Town Maine Stereotypes; at other times it's more like being stuck in some airless retirement home. Is King trying to entertain anyone except for himself? Maybe his fans enjoy this stuff, but pulp noir readers would be better served by any other title from Hard Case Crime."
4,I loved it!,"Steven King said you will either hate this story or love it. I loved it.In a world where far too much of the ""news"" is a media show, and the truth seldom gets much attention, it is refershing to read a story about the passion, of real news people, for the truth. While writing in the pulp-mystery genre Steven King manages a charming story about the value of mentoring for both the apprentice and the advisor - and about knowing as much of the truth as possible, even if you can never print it.It comes across as a quickly written story set in a style uncommon to the author - almost a throw away, except that it bears all of the marks of craftmanship I have come to expect in a Stephen King novel."
2,eeeeeh....,"I was at the airport, getting ready to fly out to Cali and I found this book in the airport gift shop- I thought what a stroke of luck I had getting a Stephen King title at such a juncture... I'm a huge fan.Despite the fact that I started and finished the book exactly as the plane took off and landed, I was sorely disappointed. Much ado about nothing would be an overstatement."
1,Waste of Time,"I've finished this book in 4 readings, on the train to work and back. Reading it, i was getting interested in the mystery, not waiting to find out what really happened. As the pages turned, I was realising that this mystery should be solved soon, coz I'm running out of pages,.. And then... The book just ends. No solved mystery... Just leaving me in the air. Not even letting me assume some kind of ending... It just leaves you flat in the air. I am a King fan.. reading the dark tower series and other novels,.. but this one simply was a waste of time."
2,Only if You Must,"I'm a long-time fan of King's and an admirer of the Hard Case Crime series. However, unlike peanut butter and chocolate, this book is an example of two great tastes that don't taste great together.This was the first of the Hard Case books that didn't deliver damsels, double-crosses, and tough guys. It reads like something King had hidden in the bottom of his trunk from back in the early '60s, and updated minimally for 2005. There was no tension, no thrills, and I had no interest in reading it after page 75, but pushed through the last 100 pages anyway.I think all fans of tough guy fiction and horror books should steer away from this book."
1,Blockbuster error?,"I generally enjoy Stephen King books (and LOVE many of them), but this was horrid -- it's astounding that he can tell such a boring tale in so short a space (though the ""story"" -- and I use that term loosely -- is about four times as long as it needs to be).Here's my question, and then I'm done thinking about this book: King goes out of his way to mention that the dead man and his wife watched some movie from Blockbuster before he died. Now, he died in 1980. Blockbuster didn't open its doors until 1985. Is this one of King's notorious research (as in lach thereof) screw-ups, or is this some kind of clue?In the spirit of The Colorado Kid itself, I will ask only the question and not even attempt to answer it."
1,Stupid,"I will never EVER again buy a book just because his name is on it. Waste of money. He is selling a short story for almost the price of a novel. Nice way to make money but it is the last time I fall for it. To the used book store it goes so some other sucker can read it, but at least it will be 1/2 price. Still a waste of money at 1/2 price."
2,Read This so You Won't Be Disappointed,"I love Stephen King's work, but every once in a while, I get disappointed. This is one of those books that did disappoint. I was captured by the story's potential and quickly read the entire book in one sitting.Here is where the ""however"" comes in . . .Without giving away the ending, I can only say that, to me, there was no ending. What could have been a great plot twist, ended flat.What could have been a great short story, had me shaking my head and asking, ""WHAT??? Is this it?""Sorry Stephen, but that's what I felt. (It will not discourage me from getting ""The Cell"" as soon as it is released."
3,Excellent read,Typical king. just short. not quite what i expected from a king book but was definitely entertaining. need more to read@
4,Good King Yarn,I appreciated the drawn out tale with **spoiler alert** no conclusion. The characters were engaging as all King characters are and the story was well told. Good book.
1,Colorado Kid Story,"The book was a disappointment. Not the usual King book. There was no conclusion by the end of the book, which he warns at the end."
2,Unusually Short,"As an avid fan of Stephen King, I have read most everything he has written. This book was enjoyable, I was cruising along, reading, snacking, and then BAM it was over. I hated that, and that's why the low rating from me."
2,"Stephen King tries to be Jerry Seinfeld, and fails.","I understand the experiment Stephen King had going with this book. ""Is it possible to write a book about nothing?"" The answer, at least in this case, is a resounding NO. Mr. King tried to write a book who's merits stood strictly on the narrative. As he repeatedly said throughout the book, there is no story. ""There is no through-line."" It is a highly unsatisfying book, not because there is no solution to the mystery, but because there was barely any mystery. It was so mundane. At no point did I really care to figure out the mystery. If Mr. King had given me something to sink my teeth into, then maybe I would have been interested and I would have gotten involved. Instead, I finished the book, just to finish it. As the kids say, EPIC FAIL."
4,A Stephen King mystery,"""The Colorado Kid"" is a mystery written by Stephen King. The three main characters are two older men and a young woman, all newspaper reporters, and the story is told through a conversation between the old-timers and their young employee.Years before, and unsolved mystery took place in their small New England town. The Colorado Kid was found propped up beside a trashcan on the beach, a piece of meat stuck in his throat and likely what killed him. The unsolved case sparks theories as to what happened, why he was found thousands of miles from his Colorado home, and if he suspected what was coming his way.I'm a huge fan of Mr. King and loved reading this story. [I hope others won't be upset that it isn't in his usual horror genre and will enjoy this novel for the great read it is.]"
4,A good and bad body start!!!,"This book is pretty good, except it as a huge part on girls but barely anything about boys. Don't get me wrong the girl part shows a lot of different poses and there really good. Its just if your looking only for boys you shouldnt by this book."
3,Eh....It's Okay,"When I bought this book I was expecting to see an explanation on how to create different emotions and body frames. Well...not exactly. The emotion information they shared wasn't really helpful. Just showed a bunch of odd faces.As for the body. It had many different poses to put a ""female"" character in that I have to admit were really cute. But it would've been nice to get a detailed explanation how to get all the different positions. They didn't have any on males, but they did draw out the different sizes of a male's body. Not really helpful.Then they gave a little info on the hands and feet and the other pasrts of the body and yeah. That was pretty much it. They did have a few pictures of different kind of men and women in the back. But it really wasn't helpful.But hey, if you're wondering about doing different poses for your character. This is the book for you. They have different pages of positions for miles."
4,sorta useful how to book,"I have several books of how to draw and this one is firmly in the middle of the pack usefullness wise. Some of the shortcuts to figure construction are worthwhile, but like many of this genra of how to books, it spends too little time on storytelling and too much on pin-up drawing. Still, it is better than just about any Christopher Hart book."
3,eh just ok,this is kinda fun because its so weak you can shoot your friends and they wont really get hurt. they think its funny. not like a real airsoft pistol
1,Piece of junk,"This pistol is junk. Shoddy craftsmanship. Very low power. I shot myself in the hand at point blank range and it didn't hurt or leave a mark. It says 200fps but the cheap plastic bbs droop after about 20 ft. It's great to shoot at target paper from about 15 feet away, anything after that and accuracy goes away. I recommend yo spend your money on a better gun. Oh well, you get what you pay for. 20 dollars worth of plastic junk."
2,not very good,it is ok but i hated it doesnt go very fast it doesnt hurt wen u get hit wich sux its not acurt it breaks really easy and it doesnt even look cool if ur thinkin bout buyin it save more money and get a toris
5,Tells it like it is!,I live right in the midle of this wine growing area and this video is an excellent documentary on the feeling and flavor of all the small family owned and operated wineyards in the California Foothills Gold Rush area. Interesting background and history with good production value.
5,"""This Is Your Glass Of Darkness...""","If you are an Industrial purist and you do not own this...that's a crime! A monumental classic in electronic music. A thematic journey into a dark architecture. Beautiful, frightening, and ultimately stunning! A groundbreaking release. Best known for singles ""The Hacker"" and ""Sound Mirror"". This re-issue is re-mastered and you can tell! To listen to this brilliance in 2003 is tantamount to listening to it the first time back in 1989. Sonic bliss."
3,Cute,Not as good as the first book but humorous none the less. It was nice for light reading and clever twists
4,An Intriguing Tale,"A very intriguing story about the importance of myth in everyday life. At times, the writing is brilliant, poetic and powerful. At other times, it's more than a bit confusing. But it's a book that's definitely worth reading."
2,sharp end,"My father was in SOE Station 10, Aston at the establishment of Special Operations Executive, so I can confirm the events in this story."
3,It's OK!,"This books is interesting, yet it is not a great book to read or to enjoy is just not of my interest."
1,No Good,Threw it away when I could feel the burn through it! Save your money and skip this one. Not worth the money. And definitely not worth the high shipping cost.
3,Pretty Disappointed,"I got this CD set, mainly because of one song that I had been trying to remember for a very long time. When I finally found the song, and found it on this CD set along with other great songs from the 80's, I ordered the CD. When I started listening to the CD, I was pretty disappointed about the fact that the songs are not in their original (or popular) version. When I want to listen to an old song, it is because of the version that I know and came to love, and I want to hear that version. The songs were great, but the versions on this CD set are not that great."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE CD'S,"This is just another way the music labels screw you. I'm beyond disappointed with this collection. This is akin to buying the ""best of"" and having to buy another disk to get that one song you want that is deliberatley left off all other collections. And they wonder why cd sales are down. Who wants to listen to other obscure mixes and live performances. Of course, shame on me for not reading the other reviews. What can I say, I ordered it at 11 o'clock at night and just didn't think."
1,"If you want original songs, don't buy this CD!","I bought this CD hoping to receive original versions of several 80's songs that I like. I was disappointed when I started listening to the songs and discovered that nearly all of them were live versions of the songs that were recorded at concerts many years later. The tracks that aren't live are also not original versions of the songs. Most of the tracks are so different from the originals that they are nearly unrecognizable - mostly from the super-annoying crowd noise polluting the music. I did get a laugh from this CD though. The artist for Poison's ""Every Rose Has Its Thorn"" is listed as ""Bret Michaels & Friends""! Apparently they couldn't use the name ""Poison"" since they couldn't get all the original band members together to do their low-budget re-recording.Do yourself a favor - spend your money on a different CD."
1,NOT what I expected!,"Wish I'd known that these tracks were all live recordings, rather than the radio versions which I remember as ""hits."" So if you're looking for the original radio versions, then suggest you look elsewhere."
4,keeps food cold,not a very high eer but only around a dollar a month more electricity than a energy star model. this refrigerator looks nice and is roomy enough to hold all my food. i wish the bottom section would hold gallon containers but the door will not shut that way. if the middle shelf is removed two gallons will fit in the middle. runs pretty cold and freezer keeps ice frozen. if you remove the freezer drip pan it stays much colder at a lower setting. [...]. remember this unit does not have a flush back so there has to be a space between it and the wall. there are coils that need to be cleaned and under the coils is an empty space thats not covered and you can peer in at all the machinery which freaked me out before i realized it was normal.
1,Dont waste your money!,"I ordered this for my daughter for her birthday, but we ended up opening it as soon as it got here. I also purchased the newer Little Mommy potty doll and I have to say I am sad I wasted my time & money on this doll. The newer one, while it doesn't actually go, is MUCH better. My daughter has trouble getting the bottle into this ones mouth, and then she has trouble bedning the legs to actually get her on the potty. She hasnt touched this one since we first opened it and I doubt she would ever give a rats rearend if this doll somehow got misplaced into the donate or yardsale pile!I'd give it zero stars if I could."
2,Not a good doll to potty train with,"This doll is great for playing with, but not for potty training purposes because she will only pee on her special toilet, which is very small and doesn't really look like a training toilet. Also it is almost impossible for my 16 month old to get the bottle all the way in the doll's mouth because it is really hard to press it in far enough. And if the bottle is not all the way in water gets everywhere. My daughter likes to play with this doll, but I will have to buy another doll to teach her how to potty."
5,Sammy Hagar's Best Ever!,"Red Voodoo Rocks! Sammy Hagar belongs with the Waboritas; they are a tight band. Every song on the CD is great (music AND lyrics). Listening to this puts me in a very upbeat mood and makes me realize how much I enjoy life! Sammy's positive attitude is what made me a fan and I must say, his voice is getting even better with age. If you like rock, you will love Red Voodoo. Mas Tequila!!!!!!"
5,"""Mas tequila!""","I just caught Sammy and The Waboritas at the Hard Rock in Chicago and the band sounded great! They played the entire CD before the show and I can honestly say I didn't hear a clunker on it. ""Marching to Mars"" was good but ""Red Voodoo"" really rocks. The Van Halens can have their sour grapes, Sammy's got Mas Tequila!"
4,red voodoo,"I really enjoyed this album. Nothing complex or epic, but that's not what Sammy is all about. Straight ahead good tunes about drinking, lovin' and partying. Pretty standard Sammy stuff. It's good to see Sammy moving forward from VH and doing what he loves and having fun. David Lee and the VH brothers could take a lesson from this guy instead of continuing to hurl insults at each other, wallowing in misery and making music that is boring."
3,3.5 stars,"This cd is good but not great. This is the second Sammy Hagar cd I own and it is better than the other one (I Never Said Goodbye). However, it is still not good enough to be a true high-quality album. It certainly has its good parts, such as Mas Tequila and Right on Right. Other songs, such as Lay Your Hand On Me and Sympathy For the Human are not good at all. Overall, it is a fun album but not one I would recommend getting over something like Aerosmith or Def Leppard."
2,Same as last solo album,"I am a huge Sammy fan and loved him with VH. But this album disappointed me. However, it has a few fleeting moments with songs like the The Love and Red Vodoo. But Mas Teliqua is a rip off from Gary Glitter's Rock n'Roll part 2(come Sammy be orginial) It sounds like his last album and the lyrics are very cliche and similar to Marching to Mars. Sammy your much better than this. Your work with VH was outstanding. I'm sick of VH, DLR, and Sammy going through the motions. Either give it up, or put something out to remember you guys by."
4,Sammy Hagar just won't go away.,"Critics may hound this album for it's lack of original content and it's Cliché's. But, com'on guys this is rock'n roll, and this is Sammy Hagar, and on Red Voodoo, he's just delivering what he does best, and that's classic rock Red Rocker style.On Red VooDoo Sammy gives us 11 tracks of the best classic rock produced in years. Not a sign of aging in this guy, he's still got as much energy as he ever had. This time going back to his solo roots and abandoning the Van Hagar sound almost completely.Way to go Sammy, can't wait to see the show!"
4,Sammy never gets old...,"""Red Voodoo"" continues much the same of ""Marching to Mars"" with a bit more party thrown in for good measure. Hagar's attempt to remain vital is heartening, although you'd be embarrassed if a 51-year-old man on the street was caught talking about ""shagging"" someone. But that's a small complaint. I've already added this record to my party-favorites, such as AC/DC's ""Back in Black"" and Whitesnake's ""Saints An' Sinners."" Mas Tequila indeed!"
1,Ashamed of the Quality,"I am amazed that the red rocker would stoop to such a low level in fact I am ashamed. Sammy you are much more of a blessed and capable artist than this. God (the one and only true God that is above all other man made god's ie. buddh, krishna new age etc.) has bleesed you beyond many with a talent. Maybe if you get your life straight with the one and only true God who is out there above all the man made god's your music will improve with a message and music that actually is pleasing not only to yourself but to others and to the real big G God who is out there. I know you are searching. He is there and he wants a relationship with you. See your friend Lou Gramm to talk more about the subject. As for Voodoo I know God is not pleased and this fan who goes all the way back to the Montrose days is ashamed."
3,Better than MARCHING TO MARS,"This is Sammy startting to let go and do some of the fun stuff that he is used to, however maybe he needs to go back to his routes a little more. The opening track of MAS TEQUILA is a very good track however what the heck is up with the Gary Glitter sampling. The next song SHAG, makes me think, what the heck did he have mas tequila when writing it. The next pretty good song on the album is HIGH AND DRY AGAIN. It's my belief that a true Hagar fan will and should purchase this album. Please don't get me wrong this is a good album but this isn't his best work."
1,Give It Up,"This CD along with Marching to Mars is the most pathetic attempt at Red Rock Sammy has ever put out! He says that he is now playing music that ""he wants to play"". Well I guess that is shallow, self-indulgent product promoting BS! Mas tequila sounds as fresh as Billy Squier's The Stroke! How long did it take him to come up with that one?? 2 Minutes?? Van Halen sucks now and so does Sammy!! He needs to put down the Ding Dongs and get himself on a treadmill! And while he's at it he needs to dump his Rudolph The Red Nose Reindeer land of misfit toy bandmates and get some REAL musicians! Where the hell is BILL CHURCH?? He was a HUGE part of Sammy's solo success and now he's no where to be found!! Sammy is trying to be way too PC with his multi-cultural subpar bandmates. The music clearly sucks and I'm sad to say so does he."
3,Never thought I'd hear new music like this again!,"Just when you though arena-rock was dead and buried, Sammy comes out with a flat-out rockin' disc that hits most of the right notes. Nothing challenging here, just lots of guitar, drums and Sammy's great pipes."
5,MAS TEQUILA!,"Sammy has once again shown that he still deserves the title of ""red rocker""! This cd shows all of his finest qualities, from Mas Tequila, in true Sammy style, to returning of the wish, which brings me back in my mind to the great days of power ballads. Eddie and Alex should have kept the best thing that ever happened to them, because Gary Cherone bites!"
1,Sammy's not what he used to be,"I purchased this CD with the hope that it sounded like ""I can't drive 55"" which I liked the first time I heard it. What I got was warmed over less than hard rock with songs that all sound generic, not Van Halen or Hagar. What a disappointment !"
5,a flood on the margins,"While the major publishers are paying fiscal homage to the bland conglomerates by purchasing and publishing bland fiction, university presses have been picking up the aesthetic slack by publishing some of the best literature in translation and, thankfully, the best of American fiction. There is no better illustration of this phenomenon than SMU's publication of Trent Stewart's Flood Summer, a book of a quality that eighty years ago would have earned it the right to be published alongside Thomas Wolfe and hailed the advent of a fresh talent mentioned with the likes of Fitgerald, Faulkner, and the rest of the writers who left Main Street behind in order to write about it. This is a book with its own pace, without a 'hook', a real novel, with intelligent prose, acute observation that takes place naturally within the scope of event and action, and sentences the rise up like water moccasins coiled in trees above flood water evoking the best of Conrad and Cormac McCarthy."
5,Very Well Written,"Our family loved The Mysterious Benedict Society. When we found out that Trenton Lee Stewart had previously written a novel for adults, I bought it for my husband for Christmas. He finished it and told me that I had to read it. We were both drawn in and actually found ourselves holding our breath while reading parts of the book.This was a thought-provoking, page turning book. It's refreshing to find a piece of modern fiction that is this satisfying!"
4,"Good, but not Bring the Family brilliant","This is a good CD, if not as good as Hiatt's previous release under his own name, the brilliant Bring the Family. I have never liked the first few songs on this CD all that much, finding them too loose, jangly and happy-sounding to my liking. I much prefer the emotive ballads like Icy Blue Heart and Feels Like Rain, and the harder rock of Ride Along and Paper Thin, probably because they are more like the songs on Bring the Family. Hiatt being happy and light-hearted doesn't really work for me. Having said that, this CD is still well worth a listen and a must for Hiatt fans. As is always the case with him the musicians Hiatt gathered for the recording cannot be faulted, and Hiatt's voice is magical- it sounds like the voice of a man who has suffered, but has found inner peace, which is indeed the case with him."
4,A great group of songs. Wow!,"Phenomenal writing, guitar playing, and vocal phrasing. I love this album. ""Drive South"" and ""Feels Like Rain"" give me chills. I'm still humming ""Trudy and Dave"" and I bought the album a month ago. Looking forward to seeing John perform at Indy Jazzfest in June."
