5,"It's really ""PITCHIN'"" Love this music, lyrics, sound!","Caught the last song as the movie credits were rolling and just had to see what the name of the artist was so I could find the music. I found it and bought it right away. I play it constantly and everyone I know who hears it loves it too. Keep up the great work, Kathleen. Everyone needs this one in their music file."
5,This CD is really Good..,"I thought this cd was really good too, I discovered her along with the Nikka Costa connection (She sings background on this CD), but the She is nothing like her, this CD is real good, ... the Joy, and Whatever it takes are Standouts...But her newer one is even better than this IMHO, Find her CD ""Shiva"" if you can, because that CD is even better than this one.."
4,Did you also know...,"... that Kathleen Wilhoite is the voice of ABC/Disney's ""One Saturday Morning"" cartoon ""Pepper Ann"", and sings the theme song to the same! --- TMB"
4,Great Single for the No Doubt Fan!,"When I purchased this CD Single, I already had the original album but there were two previosly unreleased songs and I'm a die hard fan so I jumped at it. Besides the fact that Simple Kind of life isd a great song, the two other songs ar also good. Especially FULL CIRCLE. I didn't care for Beauty Contest as much but it's still a good song. If your a fan-definatly buy this Cd."
4,Simple Kind Of life,This particular song is a different offering from their usual arraingement. Their structure of guitar and bass work independently of each other to provide a pleasent contrast. I feel this song is a mile marker in their musical growth. Gwen also flexes her song writing ability as her first fully credited song for the band.
5,No Doubt ROCKS as Always !!!,"I'll keep it short for the ones who is gettin so curious and a little mad...Full circle is great !!!! it must be in the R-Of-S album.Beauty contest is good but not as good as DS or just a girl.You know simple kind of life.It's like the new version of Don't speak(don't forget to take a look at the amazing (!!!) lyrics)Well, I am a fan of nd for 4 years so you better believe me ! You have to have it !!!!!!!!!!"
5,Instant Pain Relief,"Mom's knee has been giving her trouble for the last five years and she was reduced to taking Aleve. Joint Synergy was suggested by a friend and the price was so reasonable, we figured we'd give it a try. WOW!! Instant relief and it lasts at least four fours with no, absolutely no side effects. One look at the ingredients and now.....you know the rest of the story!"
4,Great for neck joint & muscle pain,This product has given me greater relief than I expected. Someone slammed into the back of my vehicle on Jan 28 & this has really helped with pain.
1,Worthless!,"I was extremely dissapointed by this book. I was looking for a book that would give me a step-by-step process on how to take my idea through the process of creation, patenting & marketing. This book focuses on assuring you that you are capable of coming up with a good idea for an ivention because you're good enough and smart enough. It is a book for those who need to be reminded that they can achieve anything as long as they put their minds to it. Well, I'm past that part; I'm interested in knowing what pitfalls to avoid and what steps to take to get my invention off the ground. This book should not be entitled Invent! but rather You know you can do it! The only redeeming part of this book is a list of telphone numbers to patent offices and libraries etc. as well as websites, but it still doesn't make the book worth the $."
4,"for the money,","it's quite good. i wouldn't buy it if it were the price of most other cd's. but seeing that this is just a sampler, and it's cheap, i reccommend it. the only band i'd heard before was the alkaline trio, but once i heard some of the others, i realied that there were some good bands on here. if you have some extra money, like the [cheap] sampler cd's, and a little extra time for some good music, go ahead and buy this."
4,A good comp that is missing one thing,"Overall this is a decent compilation of Fueled by Ramen records. Personnally, if having to choose between the first samplier and the second, I would have sided with the first. As far as the actual CD is concerned, the Stereo's and Impossible's songs are by far the best stuff on the CD. ""Sweet Redemption"" by Jersey and ""15 years"" by Ensign are also very good songs that add to the many genres that make up Fueled by Ramen records. The one missing aspect of this record is a song contributed by the band Jimmy Eat World, which released their ""Lucky Denver Mint"" single/EP on this label. With this inclusion , the complilation could only have been better. Though without, it is still a very good effort."
3,Disappointing compared to Kasparov's great works,"Kasparov's great works of chess literature: The Test of Time, New World Chess Champion, London-Leningrad Championship, tower above this watered down career summary, Fighting Chess. Much of the book is taken verbatim from those other works. There are many additional annotated games here, but there is nothing to recommend this book if you have the other mentioned works. Those other books are still available through various sources on the 'net. Certainly, Fighting Chess is essential for hardcore Kasparov fans; but The Test of Time alone can keep you occupied for probably a year, so I see little need for this book. Plus, it is a physically smaller book, unlike the previous Pergamon works, which were the large softcover, double-column format that was so attractive. In sum, this is a nice summary work of Kasparov's career to '95, but get the other books instead!"
5,gary kasparov's fighting chess,"gary kasparov, one of the best descriptive annotators of all time, dazzles us with brilliant combinations of wit and chess moves. A great collection of games from a great chess player! This book also comes with crosstables of tournaments which add even more character."
5,Revealing and amazingly accurate account of the Dillon case.,"Maria has effectively captured the history and current events that shroud 20 years of mystery concerning the untimely death of a dear friend and classmate. She amazingly has been able to capture information from both sides of the case and presented them in a format that is easy to read. Although she accurately details the results of the trial, she gives you enough information that you can draw your own conclusions to the validity of the verdict. For those of us who know and love the people and community entwinded in this case, it is an ""must read"" book."
1,"It's A Waste, Don't Buy","I bought this in hopes to kill fleas on my dogs. My dogs didn't even have that many fleas. I followed the instruction as it said and my dogs still had fleas. I even repeated the bath the next day and this shampoo did not do as it claims it is suppose to. I do not recommend using this product, don't waste your money."
1,Nocustomer service,"I sent n email with the following question to customer service:""Which formats may I play on Axion AXN6079 7-Inch Twin Monitor Portable DVD System?""First email answer:""This unit will play most formats."" Signed by Reginald K. Johnson.Asked again:""Will you be so kind to tell me exactly which formats does it play? There are more than 30 video formats...Textual Answer:""All excerpt VCD's."" Signed by Reginald K. JohnsonThird email: Are u sure you want to work in customer service? I'm planning not to buy the equipment due to your help.2 weeks and still no answer..."
5,Great product / received as expected.,Good seller. The item was received in proper condition as described.
3,Good and not so good,"Over the last few years I've been listening to Man and now own just about eveything they've put out. How I missed these guys in the 70's I don't know. I really enjoy thier music. This is a CD I just happened to notice, so I decided I'd take a shot. Since it's called ""The Dawn Of Man"", I wasn't sure how good it would be, being early music and all. The 1st CD was kind of rough, not what I'm used to from this band, but it is early music. The 2nd CD picked up nicely and I was very impressed. It's always been a little tough for me to find middle ground, but that's getting better these days. So, for now, 1 star for the 1st CD and 5 stars for the 2nd. That makes a solid 3 over all, right? What you hear is what you get."
3,Good for small spaces but doesn't spin smoothly.,"Good for a small kitchen and has all the basic spices included in a common spice rack. However, it does have a cheap quality feel and it doesn't spin very smoothly. I end up moving the entire rack because it's not weighted enough. I think it depends on the countertop, and for some reason, it doesn't work well on mine (painted wood countertop). The size works best for my kitchen, so I will keep it for now."
1,DID NOT COME WITH SPICES AS ADVERTISED,"This product is pretty nice, except for the fact that the spices that were supposed to come with it were not included. At first I thought maybe the description on Amazon was wrong, but then I looked at the box it came in, and it listed all the spices that were ""in the box"". All the jars were completely empty. The thing is, the box smelled pretty strongly of spices. So what the hell? Did the seller steal them all before shipping? Do they eat coriander by the spoonful? Do they smoke oregano thinking that its weed? Who knows. Oh, another cool thing is they didn't include a receipt or anything so I can't return it. Cool business plan guys. I give this product two middle fingers up."
4,phone for the true professional,"Great phone for a professional. I would have given this phone 5 stars except I had problems with getting the software to work, and talking into this phone is like talking into a calculator (ergonomically). That is easily fixed with the use of Bluetooth, which I highly recommend. Buttons are extremely small (sacrifice full keyboard for button size). Internet is awesome (for $47 a month I pay, id expect it to be). Not having a camera on the phone, unlike my previous Motorola, makes this phone more business like, and less play. The address book is invaluable. I have around 300 business cards from clients and this phone stores more information than you can find on a business card. The calendar is an organizer and you can program meetings. My only regret was not buying this phone sooner."
2,Good PDA BAD Phone,I dont know if it the service or the Phone but I have had the most dropped calls in this last week of owning the device with the Cingular service than I have have ever had in my 6 yrs of using a cellphone. I was with T-Mobile before this and used a $19 phone for the last 2 years and the voice quality was great.This thing goes back to the seller.
4,Great communicator,"Is a great email and phone tool. If your primary purpose is to use this for a phone, DO NOT GET IT. If your primary purpose is to use it for email, this is a great device. I also use it for a phone, but it really doesn't shine in that department (although it is far superior to the 8290 that I had before.Key highlights:1. Quad band for international roaming everywhere2. Push email is awesome3. EDGE is4. Google Maps Mobile is the most useful 3rd party download EVER! Works fast with EDGE.5. Smaller than other blackberries.6. Screen is great."
3,Description is deceptive,"Most descriptions for the 8700c (not 8700g or 8700r) says that the phone supports MMS. It does but Cingular doesn't allow you to receive MMS messages on this device. So the phone doesn't really support MMS.Cingular's service doesn't support:- MMS- Yahoo Messenger- Blackberry Messenger (but there are workarounds)- Blackberry Internet Service 2.0If you have several POP3 or IMAP accounts added on your Blackberry, Cingular's service only allows one from address. So if your from address is addr1 and you receive an email on addr2, when you reply, it will be sent with the from address of addr1.Beyond that, the device is great. I had a Treo 650 that I synced with Outlook. The Treo would mess up my calendar and address book. It was so bad that I stopped using the Treo and went to a Razr. The blackberry does a great job at syncing. Web browsing doesn't take long. The user interface is very user friendly."
1,1st Bad Telephone Experience-Defective Phone from AT & T Wireless,"After reading all the reviews at this website I decided to go with this Blackberry model. I Recieved my phone today, charged it, and it would not work. I was unable to open any of the icons, including set up, profiles, applications, calendar, address book, etc. I spent an hour on the line with technical support and they decided that the phone was defective. Not happy with this at all. Makes me wonder about ordering this BlackBerry. I do hope that it's not a sign that I am going to hate this phone. Waiting on replacement phone, hoping it will work 2nd go around."
5,Simply the best of Blue Note hard bop,"This is my favorite Art Blakey album, and one of my favorite Blue Note albums. The energy is incredible, and the solos are superb. The fact that it is a live album just makes it that much more impressive. As mentioned in a previous review, the recording quality is amazing. Rudy Van Gelder's use of 1959 portable technology rivals, if not surpasses, any contemporary jazz recording I've heard. One memorable moment is during Hipsippy Blues (4:25) when Blakey yells ""blow your horn"" as encouragement to Morgan as his solo starts heating up. Worth it just for the eleven minute rendition of ""Close Your Eyes"" which opens with Lee Morgan's invitation to ""leave your worldly troubles behind, and come in here and swing."""
5,Highly recommended!,What a clever story! Even as an adult I was able to fully enjoy this book. Illustration by Andrea Wallace was spectacular. All of the charactors she created were extremely charming and helped me enjoy the book even more. This book will make a great gift as well as a precious keep sake.
2,"Well, it will print","Pros: It will print. Easy initial set-up.Cons: It has problems printing fonts other than Courier. The way the paper in the tray loads makes it a problem to print sequential single pages (like check stock, think anything already numbered). The manual feed slot is almost worthless.The font problem is caused, according to HP, by the driver for the printer. It is faulty, and even though HP has released an updated driver, that does not fix the problem. As of June 1, 2005, HP's fix for the font problem is to tell you to load software from another one of their printers (which means you lose some of the funtionality of this new printer).The manual feed is for one piece of paper at a time and is just a slot - no tray or feeder support.There are cheaper printers that will perform the same functions as this printer, without all the font issues. If I could re-purchase, I would just purchase the HP LaserJet 1012 Printer again."
2,Died young,"Bought this laser printer based on HP reliability and fact that it could print MS-Dos software (pcl5e). It did just fine for 17 months, then it died. Printer had printed 13000 pages, plain paper nothing fancy ! Hp online help failed to respond in any way to printer malfunction since off warranty. Problem analyzed as fuser assembly, repair cost est. was $230 at shop in town; we trashed the printer and bought an Okidata.I would not buy this printer again unless purchaseing a 3 or 4 yr extended warranty."
2,Tray,"The manual feed is a pain, it's one paper feed at a time and it difficult to feed the paper since it's not a try but a slot - I am also having difficulty printer to tray two, for some reason it keep referring to manual feed even if everything is set to print from (auto feed or even tray 2). I have three in the office and I will no purchase another one just for this reason."
4,Blue Heelers ?,"Not a bad cd, but I can't find anything at amazon.com by the Blue Heelers. Can anyone help ? Thanks"
5,i don't need no box full of cat crap to tell me that...this is amazin'!,"got this here for my gentleman friends' bert day. tis a fine piece o' entertainment. the squids are a peculiar hick bunch, don't know who got the idea to make a show based on squids but it worked. it's amazin'. i'm hooked. As Dan Halen would promote: buy, buy, buy!!!! (I only wish it came with them free ""zippy wings""!!)"
5,Husband loves Squidbillies!,"My husband is a huge fan of the Squidbillies show and I got the dvd Vol 1 and Vol 2 at a fantastic price. The quality is good, clear picture great sound. So he is happy, which makes me happy."
5,Squidbillies Vol.2,"Squidbillies are so cute. I could hardly wait for the second volume. Granny is the best. If you are a Squidbillie fan, you are sure to enjoy this newest edition."
5,Squidbillies Vol II,"Again, Amazon has pleased me with an excellent purchase which arrived in adequate time. I enjoy ordering from Amazon."
4,Clinical Avaition Medicine 3rd Edition,"The only complaint I have is that after purchasing this edition 3rd, I saw where there is already published a 4th more current edition which I did not see at the time of search and purchase. I would have liked to have bought the most recent edition. Otherwise the book I recieved was in good condition and arrived in a a timely fashion"
5,Easy Kit lives Up to it's name,Would like to say how easy this install was and the manual was pretty easy to follow. Plus the quality of the product is an A+.
5,Excellent resource for studying Women of Hebrew Bible,"This book was invaluable as a guide and resource for conducting the Women in the Bible Study group I'm currently leading. While somewhat academic, it provides various opinions and indepth information on the Women in the Hebrew Bible. I am indebted to Alice Ogden Bellis' fine work and applaud her effort to reclaim what we can about our foremothers. The bibliography is an additional treasure!"
2,Old fashioned,I am a teacher of Spanish and I purchased this book to help some Spanish native speakers in my class.It doesn't work for this purpose.It is more like a grammar reference for people who already know Spanish. But there are other better grammars...
3,Not as much energy as previous works,"I would agree with others' reviews in that this is adventurous. However, like a lot of listeners, I am most familiar with JuJu and Speak No Evil which I am a huge fan. This recording is much more ""out there"" and is more contemplative than energizing. Check out the song titles."
5,Very nice,"I'm very glad I bought this book. It is well organized and the graphics are nice. I am just really getting into the appreciation of agaves in general and found this to be a very useful book. It has enough scientific information to be useful, but is not too technical. Good book."
3,Color selection??,"The shoe is adorable. My daughter was so excited. We both feel in love with it! We needed it for her Aunt's bridal party!NO WHITE COLOR????? Every color imaginable but NO WHITE???We were so DISAPPOINTED.Hopefully, the company will make a WHITE SHOE FOR EASTER !!!"
2,Not what I expected,"The dimensions of this publication are larger than I expected, and is more like a children's picture book than the small books I have purchased in the past for adults. Make sure you check the ISBN of the specific version you are looking for, because all of them are different. I could not give this one as an adult gift, so I still have it."
5,A Christmas story worth reading,"With Christmas fast approaching, I would like to recommend a classic Christmas story which is available for free download for electronic readers and in multiple versions of paper and ink books as well as a shorter version you can read online. Written by Henry Van Dyke, The Story of the Other Wise Man introduces the reader to Artaban, the fourth Wise Man.Van Dyke takes us on a journey through Palestine with Artaban in search of the King who was born in Bethlehem. It seems that Artaban's search is futile and he is frustrated at every turn. CONTINUE READING ARTICLE HERE:[...]"
2,One of my two favorite Christmas books,"I have loved Van Dyke's classic story my whole life. In a short book he truly captures the Christmas spirit.Whlch leads me to my next point. (I thought I would be the first to mention this point---but I find that Nils Lundgren has beaten me to the punch.) I just wanted to say that my favorite Christmas book is ""The Other Wise Man"" and my second favorite is ""Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices."" Like ""The Other Wise Man,"" this book can be read in one sitting.I recommend both boooks highly."
1,ZERO STARS PREFERRED,I ORDERED THIS BOOK FOR A CHILD'S GIFT ON 8/24/2011. THE BOOK STILL HAS NOT COME. I WILL NEED TO CHECK BUT AM ANNOYED THAT I EVEN HAVE TO DO THAT. WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN FROM THIS VENDOR.
5,Story of the Other Wise Man,"The first time I ran accross this beautiful story was when I was a young teenager. I saw it as a movie (cartoon) created by the LDS church. The movie was so enganting that I had to find the book (at the local library) and read it. The book was wonderful. It was many years ago that I read this book and I honestly thought it was no longer being published...what a nice surprize to find that it is still being published, I will buy it for myself, family and close friends....what a great way to celebrate Christmas, by reading this truely spirit filled book. It's a small but powerful book."
5,Great Book,"I purchased this as a gift for someone who had never heard of it. My father used to read this book to us children during the Christmas season, and it always stayed in my mind - the possibility of this happening and the heart-breaking ending, which I guess is really not heart-breaking because of the goodness shown to poor and needy people."
4,A life well-lived,"Every year I make it a point to read one Christmas classic. This year it was ""The Story of the Other Wise Man,"" a book I've had sitting on the shelf for many years(other years I've read Truman Capote's holiday tales, The Christmas Box, Miracle on 34th St., etc). Anyway, I liked this one very much. It's a fable, eloquently and simply told, about the true meaning of faith and religion. A ""life is what happens while you make other plans"" tale, it has spiritual wisdom that can apply to every life. Quick and worthwhile."
2,Not what it was described to be,This is not the story that Henry Van Dyke wrote. It is a retelling of his story by another person. The description does not state this fact.
5,I have given all my copies away!!,"My English teacher read this to my class in Grade 12, and I remember crying in class. Very touching story which reminds us of the meaning of Christmas. I have purchased this for the children and adults in my life so many times that I have run out of copies. I guess that Amazon doesn't mind that..."
5,The Story of the Other Wise Man,"I was introduced to this story several years ago. Until recently, I had not realized that it was prose - meant to be read in a cadence (try it) Just wanted an e-version of something that is on my shelf, and this is perfect!"
5,book,it's a good book. it is the original version as far as i can tell. i really enjoyed reading this book.
3,"""Return with Us Now to Those Thrilling Days of Yesteryear..."" (How Else could a Review be Titled?)","If you are looking for a sharply written Western in the modern day style, even in the Louis L'Amour style, don't go here. It's not what you get....The writing is dated (1936,) the story is dated and the characters are all cliches..But, having said that, I wouldn't take anything for having read it, and I will read it again---everytime I want to ""Return to those thrilling days of yesteryear....""These are the stories, characters and heroes of our youth...the writing style is not the same, but who cares...we all see and hear Clayton Moore with every word the Lone Ranger speaks,and Jay Silverheels IS Tonto.We don't read these old books for modern gratification. We read them because they bring to mind a simpler time with a simpler perspective.We were all young once, and some of us like to go there again, from time to time."
2,Guess I don't like LIVE,"Good performance when Meat is actually singing the songs. But I don't think it improves the songs to have so much dialogue, and the various extended musical interludes just seem pointless to me because they are not musically interesting. I'm tossing this CD, and I'll stick to the studio albums."
3,to operatic,"Ill make it short......The selection of songs and musicianship is great. but Meat Loaf's voice is just ridiculous, almost comical. he sings like a bad opera singer and has entirely too much falsetto in his voice. Songs like bat Out Of hell are nearly ruined by his overly falsetic voice.Music = GoodMeat Loaf = Bad"
1,Norton Personal Firewall 2004,"I'm using Windows 98 SE and have run Norton antivirus 2000 for several years and was very happy. Then a very dark cloud appeared - it was called Norton Personal Firewall 2004. I had to clean my hard drive for other reasons and when I reloaded everything I decided to get rid of my old firewall, Black Ice and install Norton's new Firewall 2004. After I reloaded everything and got back up running the computer speed gradually became slower and slower until it virtually stopped. After discussion with several experts I decided to uninstall both the 2000 and 2004 Norton versions. I did reinstall Nortons Antivirus 2000 and got a new firewall, Zone Alarm. The computer runs just fine. I am not a computer expert, but it seems to me that Nortons Firewall 2004 did something very naughty to my computer, and my blood pressure. I would not recommend Norton's Personal Firewall 2004 to my enemies."
1,HELP!! Get me out of Norton Firewall 2004!!! ZERO STARS!!,"WHY did I ignore the fatal customer reviews on this shameful product?!! After installing, my DSL internet wouldn't work, but I fixed it by turning OFF Norton Firewall 2004. But now, even after uninstalling completely (I think), not only can I not defrag my hard drive, I CAN'T EVEN ACCESS EITHER OF MY TWO CD-ROMS!! I can't read ANY of my program CD's - including Windows 2000 Pro OS - but wierdly it lets me play audio CD's. Maybe this is so that I can play a sad music until I figure this mess out. I'm just hoping that after submitting my feedback on this wretched software that I can find a fix from one of the other hapless customers who also made the mistake of purchasing it. Can you help? Thanks."
3,Maybe Mixed Blessings,"This product appears to do what it claims. Installation is quick and easy at least on a new XP computer.Online activation is required. Does this mean that if you have two computers, not networked, that you need to buy a second product? Does this mean that if I buy a new computer tomorrow, I need to buy a second product? Activation code is 24 characters to the power of at least 36 possibilities for each, which is at least the human population of earth times 10-to-the-29th.Activation codes could mean (in my untrained mind) that you are essentially renting the product rather than buying it. I did not find that that was clear from the product package.Those who are annoyed by activation codes might reasonably wish to carefully consider competing products."
1,Wish I had not bought,This program has given me nothing but problems. I finally had to refomat my drive. They charge for telephone customer support. Save your money.
1,norton nightmare,"After 5 faithfull years of norton i gave this load of stress one star,as it installed flawlessly thats about all i can say thats positive really.The program is not user friendly in any way shape or form,""does anyone know what all these numbers mean"", program control popup alerts are a pain in the a-se,they ask you to make a decision to allow or not but dont tell you what they are, its just way too clever for me! and with no way to disable them its annoying, also in this day of privacy it keeps way to many logs. I suppose its a pity i registered it so i cant sell the over-complicated load of cr-p,""good job i got it cheap"" im just going to sling it in the the bin and buy z-alarm pro. DUH"
4,Works almost too good,This software firewall is handy if you don't have a router/hardware firewall. If you are expanding into a LAN be sure to turn off some or all of the features or your computers or they won't be able to find each other on the network!If you DON'T have a router you're just waiting for a netbot to invade your machine unless you use a tool like this.
1,worst customer support,"This product if full of defects,cannot be installed easy, lot of headache and not phone support for customers. If you want for a new product customet support, they will ask you for 24.99 per incident! They are crazy! On line support? yes, send a email 5 days ago, still no answer, and u cannot find any phone # to talk with anyone."
1,BEWARE of ANY SYMANTEC PRODUCT!,"Do NOT buy ANY Symantec Product UNLESS YOU WILL NEVER HAVE A NEED FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE - THERE IS NONE! I have just spent 4 hoursAFTER HAVING PAID for SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL trying to get my renewal activated. After going through 15 menus on-line to try and email customer service, I was given a form. I entered the info. When I finally got an email response, it had nothing to do with my question, then told me if it didn't help, I would have to REPEAT THE ENTIRE ON-LINE Process! I then called their ""Customer Service"" line - PUT ON HOLD FOR 30 MINUTES! Finally had to redo renewal by phone without answer to question. This is typical of ANY NORTON PRODUCT CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
1,Very difficult to install,"Bad uninstalls of previous Norton products can cause this one to hang and not install. No customer support (they promise to email you in 3-5 days.....). No easy was to self-troubleshoot the problem (even though there are lots potential causes listed on the Customer Support web site).I've used and recommended Norton products for ten years, and will now switch to another brand. This was obviously released before it was fully developed."
1,Why did you do it - Norton?,Recently bought new computer preloaded with Personal Firewall 2003 - had problems accessing some website features but was able to fix following excellent advice from ATT. Received message from Symantec saying my version should be upgraded to 2004 version - BIG mistake - cannot access ANY website (including Symantec) with Firewall enabled - no matter what! - no advice available from Symantec website (unless I pay $29.95 per call) - very unprofessional< Symantec - expected much better from you. Hope I can uninstall. Star rating - minus two.
2,Not a pleasing mixture,"I almost feel two stars gives this more credit than it diserves. The cd isn't mixed in a continuous flow, which was actually a little refreshing. However the song selection, is lacking in knowlege. With only two tracks that are pleasing to the ear the cd is a large pit fall."
2,Only flower arrangement theory in this book,I hoped to find a step by step guide to flower arranging and instead I found an extensive list of flowers (fresh and dried) without any practical explanation on how to arrange them. The full book is about flower arrangements theory.Flower Arranging
5,Good Stuff,"This book was very helpful and a BIG plus to our marriage. It gives you ideas and techniques and explains step by step. It was not offensive in any way, just very straight forward about things men like. It helps you to find out things a man likes, without asking questions to him that may be hard to put into words. Good stuff!!!!"
1,BLAH,AND ONE MORE TIME I HAVE ALREADY REVIEWED THIS BOOK AND SEVERAL OTHERS AND THEY KEEP POPPIN UP ON MY LIST. GET IT TOGETHER PPL.
4,Great information,All I can say is it definately has some good information in it for someone who wants to know but is too scared or shy to ask.
4,Infromative Book,The book covers some basic knowlege and does discuss safe sex as being very important. At least the reader is fully aware. Recommendations are listed for products with some pros and cons.
3,Less Than Expected,"After reading all of the rave reviews for this book, I was a little more than disappointed when the book arrived. In no way would I consider myself experienced in this area at all, but all I really got out of it was a couple of variations on hand jobs. Most everything else I had already read at one time or another in Cosmo or had heard it from a girlfriend."
2,Take it or leave it.,"This was the first ""how to"" sex book I read and I must say being a novice, I learned a few new tricks. But a lot of it I knew already even as a beginner. So if you're relatively experienced, this book isn't for you."
3,PRETTY GOOD,"A LOT OF THE INFORMATION IN THIS BOOK I ALREADY KNEW BUT THERE WERE A FEW HELPFUL IDEAS. THE ""GIVE HIM A HAND"" PART WAS ESPECIALLY HELPFUL FOR ME."
5,A great book for all women - very empowering,"A fantastic book that not only instructs, but also empowers. Though explicit, the book is very tastefully written. Great for both novices and the more experienced. It reaffirmed my belief that enjoying giving pleasure heightens your own enjoyment. I am recommending this to every woman I know."
3,Am I just retarded or what??,"I'm surprised by all the rave reviews for this book. I don't think it's a bad text really, but I found some of the techniques VERY difficult to follow without a dvd or vhs tape to go along with it. Another reviewer mentioned that it would've been way better with a video aid, but I'm surprised I've only read one review like that. The handjob section is primarily what I'm refering to here. An action that requires various movements and various intervals can be difficult to explain properly via a text. As a result I just didn't feel I got as much as I would've liked out of lou's book."
4,Great book....very informative.,"Lou is a SMART woman. I was very impressed with this book. Not only informative, but, promoting safety too...!!!!!"
3,Nothing new,It's ok if you know nothing and are new to the game. I have been married for ten years and so that tells you that I know just as much as she does. I was looking for something to spice things up but it brought nothing new to the table. Good for novices.
2,Disappointing,"A bit of a loss for sensuality. Expected something a little more intimate a little more to do with the senses. Sex has more to do with envolvement than just ""getting him off"". Am I too old fashioned?"
2,Nirvana and Nausea,"Paget has great enthusiasm for her subject, and affection for her friends and students, but this is a strange mix of detailed and very vague advice. A warning to those who are more conservative in their sexual appetites - after I read the detailed descriptions in one chapter, I was groaning with nausea, not pleasure!"
3,Mildly Impressed,"It was an ok book, but not what I had expected. I was left feeling I hadn't gotten all the information that I wanted."
3,Mildy (not passionately) interesting and informative,"Trying to spice up the ol' married sex life, I decided to check this book out (I bough Lou's companion book, How to Give Her Absolute Pleasure) for my husband. Well, there are a few new tricks this old dog can learn (such as some very intersting hand techniques), and it's fun to give them a try on your unsuspecting partner, but some of the descriptions of said techniques seem so convoluted that I felt like I should have the book open beside me while I was executing them (I did NOT give into this temptation, though). I thought some of the drawings were a bit hard to follow--perhaps a video would be better?There's a good bit of information on safe sex and STD's, pages I thought could've been better used by adding some illustrative photos. Overall, not the hot sex manual I was looking for."
5,"Not bad, Give it to your wife or girfriend.","Ok, so im a guy, and this is a book for woman. Who cares!!! We guys know what we like in bed, and sometimes if we try to show our woman, they freak and come out saying something like ""What? im not good at turning you on?"".I picked up this book and just set it on the bookshelf and one night, i found my girlfriend reading it. Im not saying that woman dont know what they are doing, im just saying that these are things they can read and try for themselves.I read the book cover to cover and i actually learned a few things that I never knew about that turns us men on. So, guy or girl, get this book. Its worth it.Woman, its good for you, you never know what crazy moves would drive us guys crazy.Men, read it just to maybe have your woman try some ove the things on you. Yes, even if it has to do with your anus, it doesnt mean your gay if you like anal stimulation. Haha. Trust me.This book is great for all!!!!!"
5,"ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL,. I GIVE IT 10 STARS !!!!!!!!!!","I bought this book for my wife and WOW!!!!!. Now, we're having the best sex of our lives.....I read this book myself and thought it was EXPLICIT, SEDUCTIVE and absolutely marvelous. This book is well written and explains great TECHNIQUES and TRICKS, that will definately BLOW your mans mind.(It did mine). This is a great learning tool. My wife and I really enjoy making love now. No more stopping for a beer after work for me. I'm always rushing home to my SEXY and HORNY wife !!!!!! I highly recommend this book to all married couples and ladies if you read this book, your husbands and boyfriends will thank you......."
3,"Not Exceptional, But a Useful Resource Nonetheless","In my not-too-distant past I peddled adult novelties. I've sold books such as this as well as having read my fair share, if only to offer ideas to frustrated housewives and girlfriends alike. After receiving this book, I got through the preliminary chapters quickly enough and did end up learning a few things from the later chapters, but nothing too earth-shattering. That being said, if I were purchasing my first or second book for sex advice, this would definitely be in the running. Ultimately, if you're looking for new, different, and exciting, this might not be the book for you ... but if you want good, solid guidance beyond the basics, this is a great option for you."
4,canine tooth maintenance,"How can anyone rate this product - it would need a controlled double blind scinetific study, with, say 100 dogs using it, 100 using a placebo, all on the same diet and environment and with identical genetics. Impossible!!However, if used daily as directed, it probably does help to preserve canine dental health.More important than this gel, however, is diet. Feeding a raw meat and BONE diet, allowing dogs to chew meat and raw bones as wolves do will help more than anything else to keep the teeth healthy. Kibbles, grains are what cause 90% of canine tooth decay - the giant dog food corporations will not allow discussion of this! Maybe Amazon should!!!!!I plan to continue daily use of this gel as well as feed my dogs a biologically appropriate raw meat & bones diet."
5,Great hypnotic techno with a constant velocity beat,"This is one of my best techno CD's. I would describe the music as: not ambient, fast paced, and not too hard. I liked all the songs except for one... with Ice Cube being the best (one of the best techno songs I've ever heard). This music is nothing like Underworld, The Prodigy, Chemical Brothers, Future Sound of London, nor Orb... which all tend to sound like techno-rap or ambient futuristic sound effects (which is not a bad thing). Daft Punk is somewhat similar, but Daft Punk is more disco/danceable. Juno Reactor sounds the 'baddest' in my opinion (put on your shades and drive through the night)."
4,excellent trance,"An excellent CD to just chill to. It starts out great and ends just as well. The middle is a little on the repetitive side (the exception being Samurai, an excellent track). If you like techno or trance, you'll like this CD."
3,Ts'ok.,"IMHO, this album is fair. While I give Bible of Dreams a 5-star rating, this only gets a 3. It sounds like a bunch of keyboard presets on the latest rave keyboard and they twiddle away at the knobs. Know what I mean?"
5,One of if not the best JR album to date.,"This album and Bible of Dreams tie for my favorite albums put out by JR, sadly this copy does not have some of the remixes found on the import CD but that is not enough to detract from an amazing album."
5,Excelent reading,I loved reading this book. The story is moving. Despite the abused Rivas suffered he became a decent and productive man.
3,Adventure in Ethiopia & Yemen,"This adventure story got better around halfway through the book, where it became quite riveting. Anouk & Karen set out to rescue a young girl from an arranged marriage in Yemen, and fall in love in the process. The details are quite evocative of the African and Arab locales, and they don't overpower the story. What is so wonderful about this story is the interracial main characters, and the placement of lesbians in the Arab and Ethiopian worlds. A beautiful and thrilling adventure."
3,scatman,"thanx to el statico, i was able to find the song that most stood out from this movie. scatman. after watching that hilarious part from the film when tim was dancing with his feet on fire, that song just stuck in my head and i was dissapointed to find that it wasn't included in the soundtrack. thanx to your reviews and el statico's remarks, i was able to find it. good job :)"
2,WHERE ARE THE SONGS FROM THE MOVIE????!!!!,The CD was all right. Not very impressed with the fact that a lot of the music from the movie was NOT on the soundtrack. Read the other reviews and you'll find out that a lot of the people are still trying to find out names to the songs that were in the movie but not on the soundtrack. I'm utterly disappointed!!
2,what version of this song?,The best song in the movie in my opinion isnt even on the soundtrack. it was when they are playing chicken with the redneck in the pickup while being chased by earl the cop. the song is tremolo blooz by the presidents of the united states. but the version in the movie sounds a little different than what the presidents recorded. the movie version has a different guitar solo. anyone know where i can get the movie version?
4,classic part of nothing to lose,I have a problem with a song from the soundtrack nothing to lose.Theire is a part where the two gangsters are driving in the car and are listenning to a classic title. Can anybody say me how this title is called thanks andi
5,great cd !,i never saw the movie cause i cant stand tim robbins unless its a prison movie or something---i mean he can act i guess not like his wife whos incredible--but hes such a dork--- but this soundtrack kicks and rules-- i listen to it to wake up--- yo ! the best!
5,what is the song when martin larence threw the gun in...,what is the song when martin larence threw the gun in the trash can at the end of the movie e-mail me please!
1,Song On The Movie,Hello everyone I am in need of some help. In the movie Martin Lawrence and Tim Robbins are driving back to the city. Martin Lawrence finds Tim's video camera and then spots the spider on Tim's head and Tim jumps out scrambling to get it off. Anyone know what that Techno/Dance Song is playing at the moment?
2,Blues song,There's a blues song in the movie.....anyone know what it is and who sings it?? Please e-mail me at. Thanks in advance!!!...
1,You don't need this book,"... I was so happy to see that someone wrote a book about protools 5.1... and of course i did buy it right a way.... then i was shocked when i started to read it.... this book is only a really simple reduction of the protools Reference guide.... and actually a lot, lot less ..... i was hopeing to learn some new staff and some tricks ... well, i lost my money..."
1,5.1 version of the book was useless,Much bogusity and pomposity. The John Keane book is much better organized and written. Caveat emptor.
5,Excellent Book!!!,"Excellent book! This is exactly the book you need if your new to the Pro Tools environment. Easy explanations along with images. Descriptions were easy to follow without being too long winded. If your looking for really in-depth descriptions, read the manual. If you use this book in conjunction with the Pro Tools manual, you will have everything you need to create professional sounding music. I'm very happy with this book. I hope the author keeps expanding on the book as the software grows."
2,About worthless...,"Bass player is GREAT! Drums are okay, Singer isn't bad... guitar is pretty boring, and the lyrics/melodies, pretty much suck. Bad recording/mixing quality for what you'd expect."
1,Massive disappointment,"If you are a fan of the charming St-Exupery novel, avoid this! Many of the characters are obnoxious at best. For instance, the rose, who is charming and vulnerable in the novel, comes across as a high maintenance hooker in the movie. Please! A massive disappointment to our whole family, adults and children alike."
4,Buy it for Bobbie!,"Okay, I'm not much for children's shows. This one, however was entertaining. Kind of slow, but thoroughly worthwhile. I bought it because of Bob Fosse, who plays the snake. He is responsible for his own choreography during the scene, and it makes for a fascinating glimpse into his work."
5,The Little Prince video,"This is a wonderful and not widely known musical adaptation of St. Exupery's marvelous book, The Little Prince.The score, by songwriting duo Lerner and Loewe, is unforgettable, and the acting (Gene Wilder-the fox, Richard Kiley-the pilot, Steven Warner-the Little Prince, Bob Fosse-The Snake) is marvelous.One to cherish and treasure for years!Highest recommendation! END"
3,Too Weird but my niece loved it,"Now I like weird movies and I have always loved the story of Le Petite Prince. And I tend to like musicals. Still, I thought the whole movie was a little too weird - in fact somewhat creepy. I did not particularly like it. Someone get the snake (Bob Fosse) an editor. His dance scene went on soooo long I almost fast forwarded through it. But I didn't because my 6 year old niece loved this movie. Particularly Gene Wilder. Go figure - one reviewer thought adults would get more out of it, just not the case here. I think 6-7 is the highest age range that could really enjoy this movie."
1,Oh my!...,"I'm a French teacher who was looking for a video to go along with the book. I thought it would be a fun and entertaining break for my students. I'm not sure they've forgiven me yet. That was the most brutal 88 minutes of our lives. It was like a car wreck you can't look away from! Save your money! Watch paint dry. Watch test patterns on TV. Stare at the wall for an hour and a half. Seriously, ANYTHING would be more entertaining! Mon Dieu!"
1,so sad,"i was sent a movie to wv that can only be viewed in europe, this could have been my fault i have never been exposed to the fact that this was even in existence but my heart was broke when i put the movie in and in could not play, then i went on the hunt for other dvd players and then i researched and saw it wasn't going to play here at all!!!! heartbrake!!! i need to hurry and order the RIGHT one, but i still don't know why they would send me that one.that wasn't authorized for where i live."
2,"Read the book, Skip this movie!","The Little Prince was my favorite book as a little kid, and I still love it to this day. And though this film certainly tries its best to do justice to the book, it fails horribly. I hated this movie. Hated it. It is, for some reason, a musical, and the songs are trite and boring. The acting is uninspired, and the eponymous Little Prince is irritating and difficult to understand through his lispy British accent. The film is all-around tacky and dated. Read the book instead!!!"
1,Little Prince DVD,"I was disappointed that it didn't follow the storyline of the book.In some respects, the movie was too silly. I think that the movie missed some of the important messages from the story book."
3,It's ok.,"I couldn't remember if I had seen the movie. I guess if I did it wasn't so memorable.It is an okay movie, I expected more than what was provided. Considering Gene Wilder had been in Willy Wonka wow... this one is much different. There is a good moral to the story and it was cute, but not enough visual stimulation for me, I think most would be bored with the film fairly quickly."
5,Grandiosa!,"Fue mi primer libro completo y la primera película que vi cuando tenia 7 años y desde ese momento creo que he andado buscando mi propio planeta y mi zorro. Ahora tengo un hijo de 4 años a quien leo todas las noches esta historia, porque aquí en Colombia no he podido encontrar el video y la tecnología financiera no permite comprar por la red."
4,What happened to claymation?,"I love this movie, i just had to read the book in school for a book report, and our teacher let us watch the movie in class. i remember when i was really little, about 5 or 6 maybe, and this was my favorite movie. don't get me wrong, it still is. I just found the original ""Claymation"" version better. I think the claymation version better suited my interest when i was a kid, and now, even though I'm older, i still like the claymation version better."
1,a nauseating film,"Many people have apparently enjoyed this, which amazes me. It is as sugary, cheesy, and fake-tasting as some punitive junk food. The child is a brat who makes one's toes and fingers itch; the adults are dead to any sort of shame. (The memory of the pseudo-Fox capering round the trees is one I would pay a lot to exorcise.) The worst thing about it is that it exposes something in the book that's better not exposed: its borderline cutesiness and mawkishness. The book keeps its balance, and the result is haunting and beautiful; if you love it, I urge you to beware of this exploitation, which lunges right over into a swamp of stale marshmallow, and spatters the original too. Try instead the new opera by Rachel Portman (also on DVD), which is delicate, reticent, and magical, and will remind you why you wanted to watch ""The Little Prince"" and not a romance between Danny Kaye and Tweety Bird."
2,Sorely Disappointed,"I carefully read the reviews before I bought this DVD. One review panned it severely, but dummy me went with the majority. Yes, the music, if you can possibly call it that, is atrocious. I could not even sit through the whole movie. It was painful to listen to. I can't account for the rest of the movie, but the first part did not follow the original book in which the boy does NOT run away. Acting was mediocre to say the least and the boy lacked the inherent charm of the book. So I will see if I can get a hold of the original French versionEnd result, I will not give this to my grandson.I am sorry I wasted my time and money on this. . . I am donating it to Goodwill, maybe someone else can enjoy it.I would not even add the tag of philosophy nor French literature, that would be an insult.No I am not French :)"
5,Lovely,"Lovely, a classic, a wonderful counterpart to the classic book. Watch it and create a beautiful memory with your children.Outstanding cast, brilliant staging and production, fresh, clever melodies."
5,Very Satisfied with the quality of the Little Prince,I picked this movie up as gift for someone in Europe. It is the classic movie they all saw as children. This version with Richard Kelley is the definitive movie version of the classic story. There are multiple versions of this on amazon for as high as $40.00. Look before you buy I got mine for about $8.00 and it was the wide-screen version. Great film and if you pay attention you could get it for a great price here too.
3,"Okay, but","The movie took quite a few liberties from the book. It was enjoyable, but many of the characters were different than the book. The little prince character was cute, Gene Wilder was a good character as the Fox, and Bob Fosse reminded me of Michael Jackson as he danced his way through the Snake character. However, many of the characters on the planets seemed too much alike and not as they were in the book. Some of the night scenes were also hard to view because they were too dark. Also, some of the songs were too long and boring at times!!"
1,Beware of the DVD region code,"I LOVE the Little Prince and bought this DVD so that I could enjoy it. I finally got around to viewing it, but my DVD player gave me an error message - something about wrong region. Apparently, the US is region 1 and the DVD is formatted for Region 2. I live in Houston and bought the DVD from a US vendor, I didn't expect to have to check the ""region"" to make sure the DVD was playable. I missed the return deadline, but will try to see if they are willing to work with me. I can play it on my computer, but only if I change the region setting. Not the experience I was hoping for."
3,Great movie but can't download to my mac.,"Love this classic movie, just wish I could figure out how to actually download it to my computer since I did purchase it. Apparently Amazon's software won't work with my mac. If I could figure that out I would give this 5 stars."
3,"Not a great film, but still a classic","This is not a great film, but it's a classic story and the little boy who plays the Little Prince is terrific. Also, it's just great to see Bob Fosse on screen...and Gene Wilder. The score is less than memorable. But there are moments when the beauty of the book comes through. Really, the book is the true art."
5,"A fine reading, great music",This is a spirited reading of some great American classics. I strongly recommend this excellent regional orchestra. It is an interesting selection of Copeland's music as well.
2,a little disappointed,I had hoped this book would give me tips on keeping my indoor plants alive but it is more of a guide for how to display your plants. If my plants werent dead I would be more focused on how to display them to the utmost.
5,It was very inspirational.,I recently had a grandfather die of cancer. This book helped me relize the things he went though. It also helped me realized that life is very short and we should live it to its fullest. That's the way Eric did.
5,beautiful and haunting,"This book means more to me than I can say. Eric's story is a beautiful lesson in learning how to appreciate life. Reading this book makes you feel as if you actually knew Eric, and makes you yearn for face to face meeting with this remarkable, courageous boy and his loving mother. It is a story that is impossible to forget. For me, it takes on an extra meaning. My Uncle Joe died of cancer in 1967 when I was 11. This was my first personal experience with death. Uncle Joe died the year Eric first got sick, and the two ultimately died in the same hospital. My Grandmother sat by her son's side for four years, as Doris Lund sat by Eric's side. And so, in addition to it's awe inspiring beauty, Eric by Doris Lund remains for me a tribute to the struggles of my Grandmother and her son as well. Rest in peace, Uncle Joe. And rest in peace, Eric."
4,A learning experience,"This last summer I went through a similar experience as the one Eric's family went through. Only it was with my uncle, who was died youg, from cancer. I read this book to compare the two experiences. And Lund gave a great description of how she was feeling, what the atmosphere was like, and how ""outsiders"" don't understand what her family was going through. This book shows what its really like to know that a loved one will soon die. It questions our mortallity, and our existence, while at the same time showing what the medical field was like in the late 60's-early 70's. Its a good book to pick up."
1,"FRAUD, not Alpaca","This blanket is not Alpaca, but some sort of polyester. When I burned a few fibers, they turned into a little hard ball, not ash, and did not smell like fur or hair. The description for this item is fraudulent. Amazon should ban this seller.Also, the blanket does not look like the photo. The photo has an appealing color variation that makes it look natural. The actual blanket is entirely uniform in color.After going round&round; with the website, I chose the option to call Amazon. They answered quickly, and Melissa sorted out everything and sent me a return label, and the blanket will go back on Monday."
4,Very good watch except wristband hard to adjust,"This is a very nice looking watch. Only downside is its wristband is too long and very difficult to adjust.Casio sent me a how to adjust file and according to its description, this type should be just pushing the pin out, but even Walmart cannot do it with pin removal tool.Would otherwise be 5 star without this problem."
4,"TV with built in VCR, good and cheap!","I was looking for a TV with a VCR for a bedroom. This is a 19"" color TV with a built in VCR. I have only used it with a satellite cable connection, but the picture is good and the color great. No big extras on the VCR but it does record and play just fine. I do like the search feature because it has a real time search function.This is my second Sylvania. The first one Amazon shipped had a terrible picture with color bands running through it, so I was a little skeptical about getting a replacement. I'm glad I did, as I am satisfied with this set for the money. You pay more than this for a 13"" TV and this is a nice size screen for a bedroom. I've only had it a couple months now, so it is hard to say how long it will last, but this set has limited use in the bedroom."
1,2-day shipping!!!,I orderd this about a week before Christmas. even thou I paid for two day shipping I didn't get it till before new year.
3,It's A Simple Ice Pick,"What could go wrong with a simple ice pick you ask?? Well, the hole in the cover could be too big to secure the ice pick. No big deal you say, well every time I dig in the gadget drawer the ice pick is in two pieces--the cover and the pick. If I'm lucky I won't pick myself while digging.I've had this same ice pick for a number of years but I ruined it while working on a project (who uses an ice pick for ice??). So I ordered another; too bad I had enough confidence in the simplicity of an ice pick and threw out the old one; I sure could have used the old snug fitting cover."
4,Works well... the cover doesn't fit!,Whoever made the cover for the ice pink didn't properly measure the circumference of the cirle of the insert; the cover is too big.
5,Sturdy.,"Used several times and it works great. Handle is easy to hold. And, it looks good too when within its cover."
3,Okay ice pick,"Harold Stainless Steel Covered Ice Pick will be Okay for you if you do not use it remove the frosting on your freezer, they are just too short, too light for me to do the heavy duty work... sorry I have to return it..."
3,servicable bag,Decent sized bag without being too big. Like small inner pockets to secure phones or even a glasses case. Disappointed it was manufactured in China. I'd prefer to purchase merchandise made in USA.
4,Excellent,"Do two things before listening: forget the Isaac Hayes score to 1971s Shaft. Also forget the idea Shaft In Africa's Soundtrack is a retread.There is little in common with Issac Hayes double album and this. ""Are You Man Enough"" was the hit. Done by the Four Tops after they moved from Motown to ABC, it is one of my favorite of their tracks. It has more the funk and polish of the 1970s than the love balladry of 60s Motown.The non-vocal work is composed by Johnny Pete. He works with an elegant orchestral funk and down tempo transition pieces. Get Black Moses out of your head, listen to this a few times, and it will stick with you more for its totality than one indelible piece."
5,great retro/garage sound,"Pure and simple rock 'n roll. Lots of fun and lots of energy. Great mix of near punk sounding songs and late 60's style (NOT psychedelia. I'm going back and buying some of their earlier stuff, now, but, this would seem to be a great introduction to a band deserving of more attention."
2,Bad Language,"A friend recommended I buy this CD as a gift, and I listened to some short clips before purchasing it. The music sounded pretty good, until we later found out that his songs are filled with bad language. Wished I had not purchased this product."
2,Not a worthy investment,"Don't bother with this book. I used it for an intro-level astro course, along with Frank Shu's Physical Universe. In the exact words of my professor, the only reason we even had to buy this book was because Shu's was written 20 years ago and is slightly out of date.... we used Shu for important concepts and this for basically nothing other than revising what is in Shu with more up-to-date information. This book is kind of expensive to be simply a tool for updating Shu (which, btw, is a great book)... also, the high number of errors and typos really make this book a ""don't bother"""
3,OK General Study Book,"This book is a good compromise between the less analytical texts and some of the books geared toward astonomy majors. It is not a great book but I felt it was up to date and comprehensive. One note though, the authors assume you have a good grounding in undergrad math and physics. On several occasions I had to pull out one of my math or physics texts to review a subject so I could understand the material being presented."
1,There are better books out there!,"I had to use this book for a year. It's badly written with numerous errors and typos. Equations are written in a non-user-friendly format. Difficult concepts are not very well explained. Practice problems are sometimes very ambiguous. My professor even said this isn't the best book in the world. The only good thing about it is that it's directed toward a first-year astronomy audience. But it's worth it to buy a slightly harder book and understand it better. If you need it for a class, I guess you're stuck! But there are better books out there. Try ""An Introduction to Modern Astrphysics"" by Carroll and Ostile."
2,Needs proofreading,"This book was the textbook for my introductory Astronomy course and we found than many of the constants were inconsistent in different sections and/or inaccurate. One specific example, the radius of earth in the appendix has the last two numbers reversed. There are numerous others."
3,good if you know whats up,"i think this book is good if you already know a bit about astronomy and physics. it covers the topics it wants to very well, and very in depth. however, it has no logical sequencing of the chapters, and thus is a wonderful reference text, but not so great when it comes to learning in a call"
4,Introductory Astronomy and Astrophysics,"Good book. Well laid out and clear. The only thing that it lacks is a solution manual or answer key, otherwise a fantastic text."
3,Not a bad reference book for astrophysics students,"This book is an ok reference book, if you've already seen the material in the book. The price is way too high. Whatever you do don't pay 180 bucks for this book. The preliminary section is weirdly way harder than the main text of the book. I had as my freshman astrophysics course text book and nearly dropped the course because the prelimary section was so scary. My biggest problem is the book uses MKS not CGS units. This would make the book more acessible to the reader with a physics (but no astronomy) background, but only does a disservice to the reader who wishes to use this book as a bridge to more advanced astronomical literature."
3,There are better books to be had for an intro astronomy class,"ObviouslyPhysical Universe: An Introduction to Astronomy (Series of Books in Astronomy)is the standard by which all introductory astronomy books must be measured. This book is more expensive, less clear, has more typos and even glaring errors. But it's newer, and more ""up to date."" I'd explain to the students that we're going to use an old book and I'd fill in newer research as needed as we go along. It's not as if there are fundamental changes to how stars work, Galaxies form, or how telescopes work. (Especially not at an introductory level.)"
4,Book review,"It was very good, reliable and the product is what I expected to be. Thank you for the safe shipping, I wish the shipping was a little faster though."
1,Christian Book,"Readers should know up front that this is a Christian book. I expected an adventure story with a medical theme. Instead, I got a lecture on Christian belief as the solution for healing serious disease. Stopped reading after several chapters when the preaching began."
2,Disappointed with the portrayal of a former Navy Seal,"I have enjoyed many of Ms. Hunt's books compared to the usual Christian fluff.However, I was disappointed at the portrayal of the former Navy Seal in this book. He was made out to be a macho, gun wielding, insensitive, dim-witted character. Ironically I read this about the same time our Navy Seals found & executed Bin Laden. Then sadly not too long after that we lost several of them in a helicopter crash.Although ""fiction"" this was an insult in how this military character was written especially since our Country has been at war for over 10 yrs. now. Many brave men & women of all branches serve our country proud...some even giving the ultimate sacrifice their lives for our freedoms."
2,A moderately entertaining read,"Not much actually happens in this book. The questions about Tiger's past are answered only ambiguously, there is very little of our beloved Southron vs. Northern tension, and nothing is truly resolved.Seeing as this is ostensibly the last of the Tiger and Del novels, one would expect a certain level of resolution. However, at the end of this somewhat less than fulfilling novel, the reader is left without any resolution at all.Overall, while the promise of having the questions of Tiger's past pulls the reader through most of the book, there isn't much there to make the effort worthwhile. The book just lacks the spirit of the previous volumes."
2,Bleah,"Oh come on. Don't write in first person if you don't know how to do it. It's annoying when one character is the center of the universe and knows it.I liked Sword Dancer, but these books are written in romance novel style, even if they are fantasy. I find Tiger a very unconvincing male character, with motives and dialogs clearly written by a woman, and Del is annoying beyond belief. Ick. Ptui."
4,just what I always wanted,For All lovers of Tiger and Del a worthy follow up that rounds up the series. I knew it but if I had not known it reading the book makes the series into a whole and makes some things that might have seem far feched before clear and thorhoughly thought out. Jennifer can make every day life fit with magic and fanciful magic connect with every day life. Everywhere.
4,Great praise songs - good renditions,"I purchased this for a good price at Wal-Mart and was satisfied with it. Being in a praise and worship group at the time, I wanted to get a lot of these songs in one place for ease. Beware that these songs are not sung by the original artists, but at the same time, they are not altered too much. This did not affect me, though, for the reason above. All of the songs are sung well so if you're looking for a good praise and worship album with vocalists you have probably never heard before, this album is for you. Enjoy!"
3,Good in theory.,"I love the theory, and have used others before... This one did not quite hold up and the support strips (slightly thicker plastic cross sections on the bottom) split after about a week. Still usable, but doesn't stay on the bucket as a lid as well now."
2,Continuous deja vu,"With so many X men titles out there, there is bound to be overlaps in continuity. Anyway, I digress.This issue features the introduction of Angel, Warren Worthington, to Xavier's mutant academy. Nothwithstanding the fact that Angel was in the original X-men line-up long before Storm, Wolverine, Emma Frost etc, this is playing Havoc with the Marvel chronology. The story is that of the President appointing another team of mutants to counter the growing influence of Xavier. Hank McCoy, appearing as the blue Beast, is killed off here by a Sentinel.I can't help but notice that all the men (and women) are drawn looking like Leonardo DiCaprio."
5,love this,"it couldn't be more appropriate for keeping my knives sharp. easy to use, great results. anyone that does not get a result using this shouldn't be using this, or anything sharp, EVER. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't give this 5 stars"
4,Nice all in one,pretty great all in one kind of system. I like to use the flat diamond coated side for large blades/axes and the stones for knives. Gets them pretty decently sharp too. Not as nice as a spyderco sharpener but I'd actually take this one outdoors.
1,doesn't work well,"Doesn't actually sharpen knives that are even a little sharp already. Maybe it would sharpen a VERY dull blade, but even then not very well.I can not recommend this product for its intended purpose."
4,"Great Sharpening system, but don't drop the rods! Looking for a replacement source","As per most who've reviewed this sharpener, I agree- it's designed very well, will shape up an edge in no time at all and very easy to use.The only problem I have with it, is that the ceramic rods are very fragile, and I learned this the hard way when one slipped and dropped only a few inches on the table.Does anyone know where I can order a replacement rod for the kit??By the way, there are excellent sharpening how to videos on YouTube featuring the 3 IN 1."
5,Best Sharpner I ever owned,"I have had this sharpener for only one day. I currently own several good quality sharpeners I have the Smith pocket sharpener, Steel rod sharpener and a draw sharpener for flat ground blades mainly for kitchen knives. I sharpend the following knives by first dulling the blade with the provided course stone: Gerber mutitool blades, BK2, BK3, Ka bar Fin Mojo, Gerber Freeman and Ka-Bar Large Bowie. I am amazed how sharp these knives are now. The other sharpeners put a good edge on these blades before but this sharpener made the edges smooth and razor sharp to the point where slicing single sheets of paper was unheard of before with the other sharpeners I own. I would highly recommend this sharpener along with the Smith Pocket since the pocket sharpener has a diamond rod and fits nice in any pocket."
1,A Joke.,"Spiritual Journey of a Teenage Traveler?This is just some rich man trying to get his son to succeed in the world where image is everything and content is nothing.Worldly travels? Are you kidding me? Golf courses for RICH WHITE folks? That's worldly?The reviewer below is probably the ""author"" or his father, as you can tell by his anger.This DJ Moats calls the book Historical??The book wasn't even published. The author basically payed for it to be printed and reproduced. That's barely a real book. Anyone with money can do that. It would be quite an accomplishment if he could find a real publisher, rather than iUniverse, which is basically the same as Xerox or Kinko's.It sickens me that this kid speaks of the Buddha when he probably drives a Mercedes-Benz."
2,trying to be nice...,"but i just don't see the need for this kid to publish a book expect for by the guidance of his parents who grew up in some rich neighborhood and are getting their kid started early.rarely does this book offer any useful tips or suggestions, i turned around and gave this to the friend of mine who knew the author and maybe it becomes useful, i doubt it."
2,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT,"DVD ordered from Amazon.Sound & Picture out-of-sync throughout the concert. Notified Amazon & I was issued a replacement dvd, per my request. 1st dvd returned to Amazon.2nd dvd: Sound & Picture out-of-sync throughout (exactly the same as 1st dvd received). Advised Amazon, & suggested they pull the item from their stock; advised this would be done.Apparently, the dvd is still being made available, which is troubling."
4,Not too bad for the money!,"I am from Jim's old neighborhood, in PA, I have been collecting his work for a long while now. All his recordings/videos etc.I just wanted to consolidate, and purchase this set. It seemed like the best of the best, collection. It is, I must say. Three of Jim's Primary Albums are highlighted on this set which makes it a 'must have for the person who wants the beginning collection from Jim Croce. The purchase for the lineup of hits, is definitely worth it! and to really be the die hard fan of Jim, you have to have his first 3 albums, 'You Don't Mess Around with Jim/Life and Times/I Got a Name. They are the Highlight of this 2 CD Set!"
1,Not the item I ordered!,"""The Definitive Jim Croce Collection"" that I wanted when I ordered was a 3 disc set ... I received ""Jim Croce *Bad Bad Leroy Brown* The Definitive Collection,"" a 2 disc set."
5,"fast delivery, good product","shipping was outrageous, thought it qualified for free shipping since it is the size of a F'n postage stamp, but i ended up paying 1 cent less for postage than I did for the item, could have bought it at walmart for less this way. Buyer beware, I got took."
2,memory error,"I have used several Sandisk 64MB in my old Canon Elph camera, never had a single problem. Got a new Canon Elph DS400 bought an SD512 MB, tested the card, and as soon as I tried to upload the pics to my computer -- the card crashed. Not sure if I should get a higher speed card, but I reported it to Amazon for a replacement and Amazon was so prompt to respond and emailed me that a replacement is on its way. I wondered now if I should have ordered a higher speed card. Please do your research, Sandisk is a good brand but there may be some better ones out there these days."
1,"Agree with other users, you get what you pay for","Never had problems with San Disk before in my life, then this card came into play. This Card is made in China, and there are imcompatibility issues that people just can't figure out. Other people with the SanDisk SD 512 card made in Taiwan have no problems, just the ones made in China.It works fine in most devices, but there are some problems with Kodak cameras. Some combinations of cameras and readers work, Pentax and Casio Exslim. But using a Kodak DX6440 will not get a read on any card reader. Works great in the dock, but you can't take it to a photo lab to print without risk of corrupting the card.San Disk customer support is great, they sent a label to pick up the corrupted card (which worked sometimes when it was new) and sent a replacement card. (that process took 2 weeks) Just don't risk your pictures unless you test out the card throughly before you shoot that irreplaceable picture."
1,Horrible memory card for PDAs,"Well after purchasing my second Sandisk product (the other was the 512K CF card) I will never buy another Sandisk product again, don't care if it is cheaper. I know you other PDA owners know what I am talking about. For digital cameras I don't know, it may or may not work fine. But I've used the Sandisk cards in my Dell Axim and Compaq Ipaq and have had the same problems. When transferring large amounts of data >15MBs the files do not write properly. Half of my mp3s that I tranfer do not play. In addition if you transfer data that is greater than the available amount on the card it will frequently erase all data on the card!!!!!!!BEWARE, stay away if you are going to use this in your PDA. I've found no problems using Viking (1 CF card), MicroTech (1 CF) and Kingston ( 2 SD cards) products."
3,Lots of storage!,"You can fits tons of pictures on this little card, but you have to wait a while cause the read/write speeds aren't the quickest, but for the price its a good deal."
2,Very Slow!,"I have 3MP digital camera (Canon SD110) and with this card, too slow men! - The real capacity of this card is aprox. 480Mb.I've tried other sd (lexar) and work fine. For Performance I recommend Lexar SD's."
1,2nd try,"I just sent my exchange request to Amazon. It seems my first 512 SD card is bad after 2 weeks, and I hardly used the thing. My player shows the card, but cannot load any music to the card. I will see if the replacement works better. I just prefer it works."
3,"Nice affordable sd card, if you get one that works","Apparently you have about an 80% chance of getting one that works, and another 80% chance of having a compatable product. Esp w/ with products from obscure places like Dell and RIO, which SANdisk does not claim to be compatable with. But other than those it'll be great(The remaining 64% of the time.) Just be sure to buy it from a place that will give you credit against a lexar purchase since there's a slightly less than even chance that you'll need to return it."
5,SanDisk's are awesome!,"It's great!We used the SanDisk on a recent two week trip to Munich, Cortina & Venice.Speedy delivery and good price."
4,Card Works Great....Most of the Time!,"SanDisk makes really great SD cards, however, these 512mb's have given me the most trouble out of all of them. Most of the time, transfer is quick and easy for any file. I can put a file on the card and take it off at anytime. However, every once and a while, especially on cameras, the file almost seems to become corrupt. This problem actually happens on the card, for I have conducted numerous tests, all showing that the card messes up the file. It really only happens once in a blue moon, but when it does, it's quite a hinderance. Regaurdless of the fact, SanDisk really makes the most reliable products and at a good price, so if you are looking for a nice sized SD card, this is probably the way to go!"
1,Diskappointed,"I have used SanDisk Compact Flash Memory cards and had great results (Nikon 2MP digital camera and Cannon 3MP digital camera). This Secure Digital Card started showing errors from the beginning, and then got worse. Unable to use at all in my Coolpix 4800 after a couple weeks. Lost some great shots (I know they were great because I saw them in the viewer when I shot them) because of errors on this card. Glad I got the [...] but still feel like SanDisk ripped me off."
3,really?,I find it hard to remember when these things were this small. Perhaps it was for an old technology camera or something...
3,Basic memory.,You are better of getting a 4 or 8 gig. memory for your money. Prices have drop since I first bought this item and there are no excuses not to upgrade your camera and storage needs.
1,tired,"Most of your customers are idiots. They are no help. The rest are obviously salesmen flogging their own products. Once again you advertise a bulk pack, and as far as I can determine, a bulk pack has a quantity of one. No quantity listed for alledged bulk packs at all. Ever. Never. Never ever. At least you are doing better than ""New box, big box, pretty box. Big box pretty pretty"". But still, you do not include the one critcal piece of information I need to buy it, and it is too miserable a process to not get an answer out of you.To all customers I would suggest you type the product name 20 times, and then type, ""No, you do your own job. I am not going to do it for you. Figure it out"".CUSTOMERS ARE NOW ON STRIKE. LOG OFF. TAKE A NAP. TAKE MANY NAPS."
4,quality in a small package,"Nimble, quick and gets the job done. It's definitely a good source for a backup incase you lose a larger memory card. Great for travel and on the go or environments that may compromise your better camera. cheers:)"
1,Not a MINI SD,I haven't gotten this product I just want to warn people that are looking to buy the Audiovox SMT5000. The Audiovox requires a Mini SD not a card like this. Amazon is recommending the card when you purchase a Audiovox SMT5000 however.
1,Shipping and handling,You charge too much for shipping and handling. I would have been better off going to a Retail Store.
2,Size Matters,"Just a FYI, This device is 512,000,000 bytes in size. that is 488MBytes (1024 Method). Then there is 5Mbytes used for the SD Feature of the card, Leaving you 483MBytes. Just wish manufactures would stop playing this game and call it waht is is a 488MByte Card."
5,512MB MEMORY CARD FOR CAMERA,"Sandisk 512MB memory card purchased for Canon Digital camera works well, no complaints, price was right."
4,SD card,"Sandisk makes the best memory card products. If you use it for digital camera, try to get the higher speed cards like Ultra II or Extreme III from Sandisk. They are fast and works right away. I bought a high speed cards like 60X or higher speed cards from some other vendors, it doesn't work with my 3.2 MP Nikon camera. It takes very long to write to the memory and later gave me some error message. Stick with Sandisk."
5,Great product - too much for shipping,I was glad that I could find a memory card so cheap. However I was dissappointed in the fact that the shipping for this very small device was so much just because it was an electronic.
1,This sucks,"I bought 2 of these because I purchased the sandisk player and its all garbage and I will not be ordering them or the sandisk ever again. I returned everything and they told me I didn't and couln't do anything for me so it was a total loss on my part for 4 sandisk and 2 sandisk players, which is unfair because I bought those as gifts and wound up having to purchase brand new ones from another company. Totally horrible!!"
2,AMAZON DISCOUNT DISAPPEARED AS YOU FINISH FORMS.,"I spent time to get Memory card for more then $25 and wasted time with Amazon tricks:It tells about FREE seeping, recommend get $30 discount for opening Visa account with Amazon, but finally customer doesn't have any of that options: credit card will be ready in couple weeks and you have to pay for shipping. I don't recommend have business with Amazon.I don't recomed have business with Amazon."
5,Great value!,"This card works great and is significantly less expensive than it is at local retail stores. As a matter of fact, I just ordered another one yesterday!"
1,Lost all files on this card,"I have an iPAQ h4150 with a 512 MB Sandisk SD card, one day I was synchronizing files and I lost all my files on the SD card. I formated the card and tried to copy new files on it but when I try to add files I got the error message ""CARD IS FULL"". I tried formatting the card using Fat16, Fat32 and it still doesn't work. This card is garbage! I bought a different brand of SD card and never had this problem again."
1,SanJunk is all your getting with this card.,"I bought this card in November, and it is now December. 1 month is all that it lasted. It won't format, it won't recognize data, it is worthless. I am not sure what I am going to do with it now, except maybe hope that the manufacturer will send a new one. It is a piece of junk. Save your money or buy Lexar."
2,solar rock,it is too small...more like a bebble than a rock...and the amber light is too weak to shine effectively on anything 4 feet away...it is shaped nicely and the color is nice....so basically if it was twice as big and twice as bright i'd give it 4 stars...but it isn't...
2,It's OK but it definitely does NOT taste like Mahi...,"Anyone who is a fan of the Mahi-Mahi fish knows that it has a very distinct flavor. It's non-fishy. A true Mahi filet is delicious. I've eaten Mahi at many restaurants, and in the Caribbean. I can tell you that what I just took out of the box and baked, is NOT Mahi. Some parts of it were EXTREMELY fishy, and it just didn't have that Mahi taste. Texture seemed to be that of a Mahi fish, but taste wise, absolutely not. I wouldn't buy this again."
1,Dont do business with these folks!! They will rip you off!!!,"They did not ship my order, had me remove my negative feedback, and promised to send it that day. Now I can get a hold of them. They don't answer the phone I have sent them emails. Just stay a way from Best Price mirror!!!"
1,Jock Jams,Anyone who pays full price for this is gonna be pissed. Name one Jock who listens to this crap. I just can't imagine professional athletes listening to Da' Dip on their way to a game. I think these CD's should not be taken seriously because they are way too funny to be for real.
2,It REALLY gets on your nerves!,My sister got this cd and she plays it all the time. It gets soooo annoying. I was sick of it the second time I heard it. The only reason I even gave it 2 stars is because it is good to make up gymnastics routines to. But other than that it is a TOTAL waste of money!
4,Great Album!,I found this CD again recently after cleaning getting ready to move and it brought back great memories of my cheerleading days. We used this CD alot for timeouts and dance routines for halftime! The fans always loved this album and all the cheerleaders loved it too! It just gets you in the dancing mood! Now the only place i really hear this music are at NBA games. I think more colleges should use more CDs like this. It makes for great atmospheres at college games!
5,Great c-d!,"This is an awsome c-d! It's more of a ""pumping yourself up"" c-d. The songs are great, especially Cotten Eye Joe, The Jock Jams Mega Mix, That's the Way I like It, Ready to Go, and Tribal Dance. You'll be amazed with this c-d! I can't wait to get the other Jock Jams ones!"
4,"Nice Variety, Abnoxious Sounds","Although this CD has a wide variety of songs, each song is obnoxious and loud in it of itself. The songs are fun for pumping up before or during a sports event, but that's about it."
4,A very well done cd. Should you buy it? Well.....,"Whether or not you buy it is up to you. I found about 12 songs that I like, and so I would buy it. I reccomend you go to somewhere like Blockbuster Music and listen to the CD first. But then come back here to order it because the prices are about 7 dollars in difference."
4,Met my expectations,"Great CD for sales meetings, corporate events, or to work out to. Very upbeat & enthusiastic to get any group ready..."
3,Tommy Armour's Golf Tips,"While obviously a great golfer who understood the swing, I found this book to be a little dry & not very usable for someone who already has a basic understanding of the game. It's merely a step by step instruction on the swing. If you are brand new to the game and want to understand the mechanics, this is your book. But for someone who plays, you'll find it hard to find the help your looking for."
1,too much talking,This performance was for the live crowd and not for record fans. I found that there was too much talking and too much trying to set up a groove.
3,Old School,"Old School brought to the fore front, this is old school jazz the sounds the Finder Rhodes Electric doing this era of time had a very robust rich tone, and Joe Z brings all of it out in this session. Spanish Omelet really makes the hair stand up on your back on Joe Z solo, and the hard deep cords he uses on this set. The whole band just jams, I dont even have to mention the playing of Cannonball. If you dont have this in your collection this is a must for the old school person as well as the new school."
3,Old Tracks With A Decent Beat,"I first heard this CD several years ago. While all the songs are primarily from 1997 and 1998, it's still got a decent beat, and I find it great to listen to whilst working, as it's upbeat tempo is quite motivational."
1,not satisfied,I was not satisfied. The pendant was alot smaller then I expected. I had to return it. They were very nice about it and gave me no hassels
1,"No, I'm not missing anything. Queensryche sure as hell is.","Who are all these people drooling over this dreadful CD ? To quote QR themselves,""Is There Anybody Listening ?"" Geoff Tate not only misses many of his notes, he doesn't seem terribly interested in most of them. But the biggest travesty is the totalabsence of any backing vocals. Whaaaaaaa....???? This band won me over with ""Empire"", and, since then, the clever vocal work has been one of their big selling points. That's all completely absent here and it's really depressing to hear. I'm a musician myself and I'm absolutely appalled that these guys would release this stillborn mess. Let me join the seemingly endless chorus ; CHRIS DEGARMO, WE NEED YOU ! I also have to quesion the lucidity of thse other reviewers. Are you people stoned ??"
1,A great show massacred by poor sound.,"This record is a bit of an enigma for me, there's just something wrong with it. The performance is good, I actually am quite fond of the setlist, it just doesn't work. I think its the sound-- the whole record feels sort of muffled and flat, and it really ruins the listening experience. Honestly, that's the best assessment I can give.The set itself is largely material from ""Tribe""-- this was the tour for that album and six of the fourteen tracks are pulled from there, with the rest distributed across the band's catalog. Two songs (""My Global Mind"" and ""Roads to Madness"") get acoustic performances. Highlights include a fantastic opening ""Tribe"", an energetic ""Losing Myself"", and a powerful ""Breaking the Silence"". But regardless of how good the performance is, the whole show just feels flat because of the recording fidelity.Skip this one unless you're a fan, I can't really get into it."
4,A great album from a great tour,"If you're a Queensryche fan then this album is a must. If you're a new fan this album captures Queensryche at what they do best, play Live. Just hearing ""Anybody Listening?"" and an acoustic version of ""Roads to Madness"" make this Cd worth owning."
3,Yebrino Spring,"1st song, Yebrino Spring is totally unplayable. Three different cd players can't make anything out of it. This is one of Amazon's cd-r's."
4,CD with Variety!,"Jocelyn's CD is great, though some of the songs are repetitious. The music on her CD ranges from dance to freestyle to slow ballad. My favorite song is ""Kailanman"" (which means ""Forever"" or ""Always"" in Tagalog, a dialect of the Philippines). The love song has this haunting, exotic melody to it. One of my other favorite songs is ""Do You Miss Me?"". The beat is fantastic. Whenever I hear it, I always feel like dancing! I think 3/4 of the CD is good."
3,"Interesting, but full of typos","I am halfway through this book and while it has held my interest I am chagrined at the huge amount of typographical errors. The worst being so far, as another reviewer pointed out: ""Wrapping her anus around her stomach . . ."" Come ON! Ms Castillo, you need a new proof reader."
2,good story poor spelling,"The story wasn't bad. It kept me interested but the spelling was so bad I was thinking maybe I got the unedited version or that maybe it was written by a child. I know it was a very inexpensive book but it should still be proof read. One example it said ""she wrapped her anus around her stomach "" how did that go unnoticed before publication? There were many words I had to guess at. Am I the only one who noticed the poor spelling?"
3,Good read.,"Two people, both falsely accused of crimes, find each other in Depth Perception. Fresh out of jail, Nick Bastille comes home to try and make a new life for himself, but innocent or not, he still has the shadow of crime looming over him, as well as the grief resulting from his son's death while he was in jail. Nat Jennings never served prison time for the crime she is believed to have committed, killing her child and husband, but she did spend two years in a coma after grief drover her to try to kill herself. Upon waking, she realizes she has a gift, to somehow automatically write words her son sends from beyond. The child's message is chilling, whoever killed him also killed Nick's son, and is going to kill again.*** Now, these two lost souls must work together to stop a killer from striking again. This is a fast paced read with sympathetic, scarred characters built on an intriguing concept. Though the romance is more of a background element, it does add depth to an engrossing story. ***"
3,"Fabulous story, just needs editing","I just always enjoy Linda Castillo books! The stories are very well written, keep you reading, and always a twist or two. However, I keep finding over and over that the poor editing is distracting, In the latest I got stuck for some time trying to figure out how the heroine could have wrapped her anus around her stomach when upset. I'm curious if this is just am ebook issue?Great writing, lousy editing."
5,Reub's Best,"This is and always has been one of the funkiest albums in my collection. lt was actually one of the first jazz-funk albums l've ever purchased, thanks to Blue Note introducing the Rare Groove collection in the late 90's. ln fact, this record and Donald Byrd's Places and Spaces are my personal favorites from that collection. ""Bus Ride"" and ""Blue Mode"" are the highlights on this gem. The late, great Melvin Sparks absolutely SHlNES on this record- definitely his best guitar work, which is saying an awful lot."
1,Don't bother,"The book is organized fairly well. But it pretty much reads like a giant pessismistic horoscope. According to this book if you dream about Mars it means people in your life will make it not worth living, if you dream of painting a picture your lover will betray you or you will betray your lover. If you're searching for something practical and scientific, keep looking."
1,Horrible!,I am 13 so this book did not appeal to me. I thought i would like it because dreaming always captured me but this is a no.
1,Not user friendly,"I didn't like the lay out, couldn't search for what I wanted. I would not recommend this to anyone. Just google the meaning to your dream."
2,Not my cup of tea,I expected this to be organized differently and have more scenarios. It basically has the 10 common dreams that we all have had and already interpreted.
1,nkt good,This book used confusing terms to describe dreams and was not what I thought it would be.Might have been better if it used simple language.
3,Rather Tepid Broad Based Overview,"I am a fan of Cahill's books in this series, but this is perhaps the most lightweight entry: each chapter discussing a certain trait or characteristic, with an introductory myth to set the tone of the chapter. It's a bit constricting for a writer of Cahill's gifts, and it shows. This is a pleasant, mildly diverting entry in this series, though I suspect it will leave many (as it did me) longing for a bit more meat on these bones."
5,Sailing the wine Dark Sea,"This book is supurb, so much so that I bought a copy for my psychologist-daughter and one for my writer-daughter. The book unravels and reveals an enormously interesting insight into the derivation, evolution and meaning of the arts of western civilization. It's an incredibly compelling read, while entertaining and connecting a plethora of the cultural ""dots"" we take for granted in our time."
1,Ancient Greece for Dummies,"The brief overview of what Cahill deems important about the Greeks, the pronouncing gazetteer, a page on the alphabet, a miniscule bibliography (no doubt the source of this opinionated arrogant book) were all fine I suppose for people unfamiliar with the existence of Ancient Greece. But the last chapter comparing John Kennedy to Pericles (wouldn't Ted Sorensen have been a better choice?) and attacking President Bush in his facile comparison of the decline of Greece to the current administration, show Thomas Cahill's breezy tome for what it is: Ancient Greece for Dummies.Partisan ones."
4,Wish I could read Greek,"Maybe 4.5 stars. I am not a history scholar - picked this up recently and enjoyed it a lot. My wish is that I could read Homer in the original ancient Greek. Never thought that before - and this is due to Cahill's passionate writing. It is not a history textbook - don't buy it for that reason. But it gets you thinking and feeling about what it must have been like to live in those times. Frankly, my knowledge of ancient Greece is very limited, so I am sure that determined the value I got from this book. This is the first book by Cahill I have read and I am excited that there are many others in this Hinges series."
2,Disappointing and Unconvincing,"I thoroughly enjoyed the author's earlier work on how the Irish saved civilization. But this book was a disappointing compendium of Greek myths, legends and history that never reveals a plan behind the book. Taken in its subparts, many sections are engagingly informative in an elegant if sometimes pretentious prose. Yet the author ambles from here to there in a disjointed narrative with interesting nuggets but little insight. Where's the big picture? The author attempts to wrap it up at the end with a sentence about the Greeks' ""variety of human response, lightening quick transmutations, resourcefulness, and inexhaustible creativity.""A subtitle like ""A Greek Treasury of Personal Vignettes"" might have been more descriptive and merited another star. But it falls short as a ""hinge of history"" with impoverished and even maladaptive connections (FDR as Solon - really?) to the modern world. I am sorry to not recommend it."
2,Could have been better!,"Unfortunately, there is little in the book relating the Greeks to modern life, very few instances of why the Greeks really matter to us. It is an interesting discussion of the Athenians but virtually nothing about the many other Greek City-States, including Sparta, was included, and these other polis are no less important in defining Ancient Greek society as the Athenians. How did the oligarchs and kingdoms abounding in the Aegean two millennia ago affect future history? Is there an element of Sparta in present day governance, or in other aspects of life today? What were the differences in the various Greek States and why did democracy lose out among these various other systems? Is it true that the Athenians virtually argued themselves to death through their democratic processes and were they more successful when they turned, although briefly, to oligarchic rule? This could have been a much better book."
3,Interesting but still not sure why the greeks matter,"Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea did not rise to the level of How the Irish Saved Civilization or Gift of the Jews for me. Cahill writes in-depthly about the greek literature that I found interesting and enlightening. He also discusses the writings of Plato and Aristotle. He delves into the culture of ancient greek and the behavior of the men and women of the times.But for me, he never fully expounded why the greeks matter. I'm sure they do matter, so Cahill could have focused more on their contributions rather than their lifestyles. Cahill seems to want to merely discuss greek life rather than inform about the meaning and significance of their civilization.Cahill is a brilliant writer and historian. His writings in this book are also brilliant but seem to be off message."
2,Falls short in all areas except sexuality,"I wanted this to be a great read, unfortunately it was not. The author spent more time on Greek sexuality, specifically homosexuality, than on any other topic. Every chapter, whether it dealt with Philosophy, Art or War, spent an inordinate amount of time delving into Greek eroticism. In the end I felt that Cahill delighted in using foul language and crass terms for shock value -- they added nothing and certainly became more than annoying towards the end. Cahill opens and closes the book by talking about America and North Korea -- dating the material and making me wonder how serious he was when he wrote it.Thankfully it was a quick read and not too much of my time was lost. I suggest you pass on this book and look for another. You won't learn anything interesting here, unless you want to know more about the sexual habits in ancient Greece."
5,Putting it all together,"I was surprised by the relatively cool evaluations of this book! I have a bushel of fragments about Greek civilization beginning with Durant's Life of Greece in the eighth grade, but Cahill has sorted my fragments into a coherent mosaic which also brings it into the perspective of contemporary life. How many references I have in my ""bushel"" to Pericles's Funeral Oration, but why had I never read it complete, and freshly translated? Thank you, Mr. Cahill!"
2,Incredibly Disappointing,"I had read Cahill's other three ""Hinges of History"" titles before I read this one. In comparison with the other three books, ""Sailing the Wine Dark Seas"" seems less planned and less insightful. Cahill never really establishes a solid link between the Greek world and our own. This is not to say that he does not explain Greek contributions to art, theater, and philosophy. However, at the end of the reading Cahill left me unconvinced that the Greeks were that important in the shaping of the modern world. Of course, the Greeks did make significant, lasting contributions. Cahill simply does a poor job of making the connections seem important.If you are going to read a Cahill book, I recommend ""How the Irish Saved Civilization."""
2,Too much speculation presented as fact,"I am enjoying this book, but have the same problem with it that I encountered in ""Irish""; Mr. Cahill makes statements that are clearly speculative read as fact. I could make an extensive list, and these obvious to me...an uneducated dilettante with little scholarly inclination. It makes me question the veracity of the facts he presents that I am not familiar with. So, while I enjoy the imagery and (unlike most reviewers here) his irreverent, gleeful quotation of Greece's more ""earthy"" literary offerings, I am not sure how much I'm learning actual history as opposed to Thomas Cahill's version of how history SHOULD'VE been."
2,Couldn't get my teeth into this book.,"I found myself admiring the authors intellect but at the same time wondering why his readers would hang in there in such detail about Greek classical writing unless they were experts or had studied them.I found, it wondered a lot and doubled back on the subject more than once.The author's speech about his book was much more direct, entertaining, and interesting than the book. I'm sure all of this is in the book but I couldn't get myself interested enough to read it."
2,HARD TO LISTEN TO,"I find that with audio, if I am not happy at the end of the first cd, I move on to the next book... This is one of those. I learned little in the first cd, didnt learn anything about why the greeks mattered - maybe he is saving the interesting stuff for the last 4 cd,s."
2,"Disappointing, offensive, annoying.","Mr. Cahill is an accomplished, erudite, sophisticated academic with a gift for simplifying the complexities of ancient civilizations and, thereby, making them accessible to the casual modern reader. Sadly, in Sailing the Wine-Dark Seas, he has allowed his obvious preoccupation with base erotica (often stooping to vulgar phrases that most who are reading this text would not use in discourse with close friends)to obscure the assumed goal of enlightening the masses. Athough clearly more than adequately conversant with the culture under discussion, Cahill provides the reader with only the most superficial analysis and precious little original thought. In addition, Mr. Cahill's anti-Bush political beliefs are permitted to intrude into the narrative, serving only to demean his scholarship and date his work. A very disappointing offering in what is otherwise an excellent series."
2,"Greek History ""Lite""","Actually I was enjoying the book most of the way through. Cahill writes well, without every drab detail that most history textbooks include. My disappointment started around chapter 7 ""Greco-Roman Meets Judeo-Christian"" where Cahill applauds separation of church and state. Worse, he takes it a step further and jumps on the Bush-bashing bandwagon, even specifically calling out Don Rumsfeld as an imperialist and criticizing the current administration for a ""dismissive"" approach to the UN. Perhaps the author hadn't noticed the UN is filled with dictators and deep corruption. Sorry Mr. Cahill, you just alienated half of your fan base."
1,Defective part,These are 600mAH and the one I received was open circuit.Get the more expensive ones that Staples sell. They are 750mAH and I measured 3.8V.
4,Great CD to introduce one of Ivan's first musical works...,"If you're an Ivan Lins fan, you'll enjoy this CD. This is the re-mastered edition of the LP DEIXA O TREM SEGUIR, which appeared in 1971. This is the second record Ivan Lins recorded in his long career, and you'll enjoy having this CD around. Get it while it's available, because this CD is very hard to find in the U.S, and if it's available, it'll usually take you around 3 weeks to get it.. Buy it directly from Amazon, and not from the other sellers, and you'll get it in 4 days, tops."
4,a valuable guide for nurses,"this book has proven itself to be invaluable in my practice. the only shortcoming is that it does not contain all drugs that you may encounter in the hospital. and that is not the fault of the publisher, new drugs are being added at such a fast rate that you just cant keep up. Im looking forward to the 7th ed."
5,Good Condition,The book I received was in good condition. It had a minor crease on the cover were it had been opened. Overall I would buy from this seller again.
5,Davis's Drugs Guide for Nurses 9th Editon,"I ordered my book from testbookbrokers and I got it in two days in excellent condition, Looks Brand New. Thanks!!!"
5,A life Saver,"Nursing school is a lot of work. This drug reference guide is a lifesaver when doing med cards. The CD is a must for copying and pasting drug info and saved me so much time, I recommend this one. My other book which was required by my nursing program, had a CD but it didn't allow copying and pasting. I decided to buy this book because another student had it and at this stage of the game, I didn't care if I spent more money. All I wanted was to be able to save myself hours of time. The book is also good for the info we need for drug reference."
5,OFF THE CHAIN,"This show is sooooo funny, I almost leaked myself. But through the all the laughter Tyler Perry always brings the message of Jesus Christ.This is a must see.ALL HIS PLAYS ARE A MUST SEE"
5,Must Buy,This play is wonderful. It is hilarious but it also tackles some serious issues. I like the fact that it has a religous message but not in a holy santified way. Madea is hilarious and off the hook.
2,Disappointing but does work.,"The Omnimount Desktop LCD Mount DTM-1 can be best described as somewhat disappointing. Although the pictures and some other reviews would lead one to believe it is a great product, the reality is something different. First, the unit itself does not have the feel of quality. The plastic is cheap and the finish is not particularly good. Now, onto the performance. The feeling of the pivot points and joints is poor and not very stable. Once mounted the arm sways and bends, not providing a solid structure for the screen. With a 21"" LCD screen the arm actually sways a full inch in either direction. It does do the job though and does allow for forward and rotational movements. Again, just not engineered for high quality."
2,Medium grade product cut too small,"This is a relatively low quality product made from what appears to be a good material but there is no overlapping where the material is stitched together so I expect it to pull apart before the fabric itself fails. The mirror pockets are cut 2"" too short so the mirrors have to be folded back against the car to be able to put the cover on without a lot of stretching of the material and the seams where the mirror pockets attach to the made body of the cover.This is the 4th car cover I have bought in recent years and though not the least expensive it is the mostly cheaply made. The quality of the sewing and the seams is not as good as on cheap $60 car covers. When it fails in a year or two I definitely will not be buying a Coverking car cover to replace it.For the price it is a poor value car cover."
2,Scary!,"My two year old was terrified of this book, and honestly, I don't blame her. The giant, brightly-coloured animal faces look like monsters with gaping maws attacking the reader. The hippo doesn't even look like a hippo, but a gargoyle. The monkey looks like an evil mask. If you have a cautious sort of kid, steer clear of this book."
5,Great book for preparing for IIT JEE,I used this book to prepare for IIT-JEE in India. It is an excellent book! Two-enthusiastic thumbs up!
1,Incomplete - Must rely on other textbooks or class notes,"This book is a prime example of textbooks that don't offer complete explanations of the subject. The author has complete sections with no example problems, just writing. There is nothing wrong with this, but the questions at the end of each section do not match the information that AUTHORS provided for that section. DO NOT RELY ON THIS BOOK IF YOU REALLY WANT A FIRM UNDERSTANDING OF COLLEGE PHYSICS. I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY ANY COLLEGE/UNIVERSITY WOULD USE THIS BOOK. Do not rely on this book for anything except a paper weight. This book is a complete joke!"
3,Not too good,"Found this book to be rather lacking in clear elucidation of fundamental physical topics, but the pictures were good"
1,A RIP OFF!,"Not for real BSB fans. If you kind of like there songs, but don't particularly care for them, then this may be for you. These guys don't sound anything like the real BSB. The beat through out this cd becomes tiresme after the first 2 songs. I would avoid this all together, and if you nead a BSB medley(of sorts), by the import Bravo cd with a REAL bsb medley!"
4,Power Yoga with Some new moves,"This is a quite good power yoga workout, it's pretty different from most power yoga and adds some new moves into it which was very good and challenging at times, some of the moves reminded me a little bit of pilates exercises but after all pilates was influenced by yoga, it's about 1 hour long."
2,"Disappointing, move on to another","First of all, this DVD does not use any of the inherent advantages of DVDs at all: i.e., chapters, different workouts, and special featuresHaving said that, while this DVD does emphasize more aggressive or challenging postures, in the end, it offers nothing whatsoever over any of the other many Yoga DVDs. The workout is much too short as anyone that has practiced for a while will notice.The instructor is great, not preachy, and the music is tolerable, but instead look at any of the Yoga Journal or Yoga for EveryBody DVDs."
5,Kung Fu Yoga?,This was not what I expected.....I was looking for a cross-traing workout to go along with my Kung-fu practice and now I can take it where ever I go!! thanks !!
1,Very unfair treatment of a serious illness,"As many reviewers have already said, this book is extremely unhelpful to those who suffer from chemical injuries or EI. I am personally familiar with several of these, and know from personal experience the frustration and suffering this can cause. To argue that this is a psychogenic illness just makes it more frustrating to those who need real research and medical solutions. This book attempts to stand in the way of progress, and hopefully most people will not buy its bogus arguments. Please see, for example, Pamela Gibson's Multiple Chemical Sensititives: A Survivor's Guide, for summaries of some of the reserach. The Baylor College of Medicine also has a nice discussion of the illness on its website, with suggestions for support workers. I can't believe the Barrett-Gots book is even still in print."
1,Shills for the Chemical Industry,"If you want to read chemical industry propaganda, this is the book for you. If you want to read the REAL Truth about Environmental Illness, I recommend ""Chemical Exposures : Low Levels and High Stakes"", by Miller and Ashford. The facts show that Gots and Barrett are nothing but chemical industry shills."
1,This book is misleading and full of bad information.,"This book, written from the perspective of the chemical industry, misinforms readers about Multiple Chemical Sensitivity. The authors, with well-known connections to industry, are understandably inclined to perpetuate the major polluters' myth that the MCS pandemic (including Gulf War Syndrome) is purely psychiatric in origin. No surprise that all of the recent medical studies showing multiple physical abnormalities in MCS patients is downplayed. I recommend the reader instead buy Bonnye Matthew's new book ""Defining Multiple Chemical Sensitivity"" to find out exactly why these industry doctors are so opposed to people finding out the truth."
1,An Example of Chemical Industry Propaganda,"This book is a sad example of the effort to make Multiple Chemical Sensitivity a psychogenic disease. It is obviously chemical industry propaganda. This disease has been recognized by many doctors, Social Security, and the ADA as a real physical condition; this book attempts to tell people ""it's all in their heads."" The chemical industry is compelled to blame the victims of this disease, not the soup of chemicals modern humans are living in. If you are interested environmental diseases, this is not the book to read."
1,"Of course this book is junk ""science""","REading this book lets me know that anyone can now publish a book, and say anything they want to. Pathetic. These authors are not even scientists, and unemployed psychiatrists. Take it off of Amazon.Warning - also stay away from Stephen Barrett's website. It is ridiculous. He writes in a very clever manner, but you have to keep reading to figure out that he is a fraud. There is lots of suspicion that these authors are being paid by the chemical/consumer product industries."
1,What a load of crap!,Dr. Ronald Gots has been busted for fraud in regard to EI and unethical practices. Don't waste your money on this work of fiction. It is dangerous and misleading.
2,Packed by Fools !!! Warning Don't Buy !!!,I've bought lots of items from Amazon and I've recomended them to everyone till now. Maxell is a good brand and they should work properly; but the idiots that packed them should be removed from Amazons list of venders. I ordered 2 100 packs and they came in a box big enough for 3 or more with 1 flimsy piece of bubble wrap. You could tilt the box and feel the 2 rolls slide from one end to the other end. The plastic seal came off one roll and the spindle was broken. How many people have to write a review about damaged goods before someone fixes the problem.
1,High Write Failure Rate of 15%,"This product is poor quality.In the 100 pack, I had about a 15% failure rate with defective burns, resulting in bad disk verifys using ImgBurn software. I have had better success with other brands like Memorex and Amazon Basics. I had so many failures, that I even changed my DVD drive to insure it was not the Drive, and had the same results with a brand new DVD drive.Don't know if they were old discs or what."
2,High failure rate,"When they work, they work fine. Successful burns of video files and home movies play well on my stand-alone DVD player, which is what I wanted these blank DVD+R discs for. But approximately half of them fail to write the lead-out, leaving them unusable. All of a sudden the great deal when buying in bulk isn't such a great deal when you're throwing half of them in the trash. I won't make the mistake of buying this brand again just because of a lower price. I haven't used a lot of brands, but I have had much better success with Verbatim DVD-R discs."
5,Maxell DVD + R 100 PK,"What a great deal for the price I paid. Ive gone to Walmart, Target, and numerous other stores and you can not pay the low price that I paid for this item. First off, if you can find 100 pk at any of the stores, it would probably run you about 75-100 dollars since a 20 pk runs $31.99 at Walmart. I definately recommend this seller to other people."
5,Great DVD's,I had about a 95% success rate with these disks. For there very low cost that is quite impressive. That is much more than I can say about other brands. As to all the 1 star and 2 star reviews. Pay no mind. They rated the item based on how well it was packed for shipping not the items quality or performace. Just the packing that's all. No mention of weather the DVD's even worked or not. Just lots of complaining about something in the wrong place at the wrong time.
2,damaged,dvd package was busted i threw away 20 of them buyer said he would make it right and then i never heard anything againits been almost a month if not more
5,Maxell DVD+R 100 PK,"Shipment was just fine, no damage. Gone through half so far, all work GREAT! Would HIGHLY recommend. I'll respond later if I have any problems as I get to the end of the stack...Maxell DVD+R 100 PK ( 634056 )"
4,Great Blank Discs Very Poor Packaging,I recently ordered a one hundred spindle of these from Adorama and it will be the last time. The spindle was loose in the package and they were delivered by UPS whose workers (in my experiences with UPS) pay scant attention to preserving the integrity of their shipments. So far I've had to dispose of seven of the discs because they were too damaged in transit to be used so the next time I buy Maxell DVD's it will be from either Amazon or another vendor.
1,Constantly Horrible Results,"I've tried several different brands in several different recorders. It seems that the only thing the Maxells are good for is data storage, and it better not be compressed. I've attempted many times to write compressed data to a Maxell disk. Almost every time, that data becomes corrupted regardless of the write speed or method. Other times, it fails outright. So far, Sony DVD+R has given the best results whether it's data or movies. I now have a stack of Maxell and Memorex. Anyone want 'em?"
2,order review,"I thought it was a little too expensive,especially since i can get the same thing at wal-mart $6 cheaper."
1,"Might be okay, but 40% don't work!","I ordered these and have never had any trouble with other brands of DVD+Rs. When I went to use one, I had to try 7 to get ONE to be recognized in my DVD recorder. I ended up testing the whole spindle in a little over an hour, and of 100 of them, THIRTY NINE were bad disks. I find that failure rate unacceptable, and will never purchase this brand of DVD+Rs again."
3,Bad Shipping,"Maxell makes a great product. The 100 packs are a great value. What I'm unhappy with is the shipping. When I received my product, the box was crushed and the container holding the disc's was smashed. There was little packing material to protect the product and the box was not strong enough to support the product. This needs to be addressed for future purchases!"
3,Used To Be Good But....,"I've used the Maxell DVD+R discs a lot but this batch is acting strange, I have one drive that only likes +R discs & it wont play these at all (tries to read then times out). Other drives play the recorded media fine & they burn fine, the ""finicky"" drive still reads older Maxell +R's without error. I know around the inner ring of the DVD's the numbers are TOTALLY different then the old batch - wish I knew how to de-code them as maybe theres a clue as to whats different between my older +R's & the latest ones I bought. Curious...."
1,Waste of money,"I would give this no stars if that was an option! I bought this in the hopes that it would help my husband with some of the basics; I personally am Freestyle 1-2. What a disappointment! The girl demonstrating the elements could not even do crossovers on her own, let alone the more advanced elements. It was s joke. The instructor did not perform any of the elements; she did not explain anything, didn't mention most common mistakes, and made no attempt to correct the skater ""demonstrating"" the elements. I had to turn it off after 10 minutes; couldn't stand watching it any more. Needless to say, the DVD is now history. Do NOT buy."
1,Not a good resource for learning,"This DVD is not good. Heather Luscombe's technique is awful. I've been a figure skater for 20 years, and I thought to check out this DVD from the library as a teaching resource for my students. Thank goodness I didn't need to buy it. I was extremely disappointed. Ms. Luscombe doesn't even stand correctly on her skates. She's knock-kneed with her ankles leaning in towards each other. When she performs the movements, she's shaky and unstable. The first Mohawk shown on the DVD, she has to put her foot down after she completes the movement or she's clearly going to fall.I would expect the instructor on a DVD like this to be a proficient skater, with good form and technique, and able to demonstrate movements without wobbling around.Parents, skaters and instructors; Skip this one. You can find better videos on YouTube."
3,A Real Review,"I took a chance on buying this since the first two reviews are bogus (they are the exact same reviews for three different models). Perhaps Amazon should limit reviews to people who actually purchased the item.I just purchased, mounted, and connected The Tekton 4677, so I cannot comment on long term dependability. The product appears well built with heavy steel construction and fasteners. There was no air leaks and the hose is heavy rubber with solid fittings. At this point I cannot find any problems and would recommend taking a chance on it. I will give it more stars a year from now if it still is working well."
2,Audio issue requires a fix,"For both features of this double-sided disc, the sound is ""dopplered down,"" giving all of the dialog a very low pitch. Have seen this expressed on a few other websites but no official word yet from Anchor Bay Entertainment. Not so much a big deal for folks watching this for the first time, but for people familiar with the Reboot series and characters . . . it's incredibly distracting. Rated down because of the defect. Overall, a great DVD for the price. A little sparse on the extras, but it's just nice to be able to get more of this series on DVD. I encourage anyone that has this same issue with their DVD to contact Anchor Bay Entertainment via their website and make them aware of the issue and hopefully prompt them to provide replacements."
3,"Great ReBoot, but BEWARE OF AUDIO PROBLEM!","These segments were wonderful. There was drama, action, humor, and all of the excellent ReBoot moments a fan could hope for. The only negative is that the series has ended on a cliffhanger with no clear resolution.Further note...I just received my copy of this DVD in the mail this last week, and the audio problem is still there. All of the voices are much deeper, and they appear to fluctuate during the playback. BEWARE OF THIS TECHNICAL PROBLEM."
4,"Good, but not Great, like Seasons 1-3","First, I need to get this out of the way: I loved seasons 1 & 2. They got me into the series and made me love the characters. I hope they're released soon. (I mean, wth? Where are the first two? Why start with 3?) Okay, now that I have that out of my system...This is an excellent collection. You can't fault the DVD in any way. They did a good job. I have no problems with the way the DVD was put together.Now for the content. This portion of the storyline is very cohesive. It's edgy and fun. Sometimes it seems like they try too hard, but other times, you see the early humor of the series come into play. This portion ties up a lot of loose ends and questions that fans had, but it also creates new ones. That's good, though.Overall, it's not truly great, as I feel seasons 1 and 2 were, but season 3 stands on its own if you know the characters already."
3,This is bad. Very bad,"After seeing the first three seasons of Reboot, I couldn't help being disappointed by these two. I learned after seeing them that there was a big time gap between the original three seasons and seasons five and six. Perhaps that is the reason for the off feel, weaker scripts, out-of-character behavior, and canon amnesia (""Bob and I are just friends"" -- what the??) exhibited here.I am actually glad that the voice actors seemed to be different, since that made it easier to for me to disregard these inferior arcs and go back to enjoying seasons 1-3.Recommended only for fans who will download anything Reboot, whether or not it's corrupted data."
1,Low-Tone Voices,"I'm not sure is it just my DVD or the whole production, but my DVD surround sound have very deep voices for the characters of the movie. Ex. Throughout the movie I realize that BOB/DOT/FONG etc. have unusual deeper voices compared to what CartoonNetwork shows. It's like somebody had turn down the key tone making all the characters have deeper voices.I was happy and excited that the Series 4 finally came out but I'm very very... disappointed with the key tone of the movie."
4,Seemed to be ok,"Once it was installed it broke the end twisted off, I will have to order another one. Ordered replacement today"
5,A spanning collection of modern literature from the west.,"The Bedford Guide to Literature brings together some of the most timeless and representative stories, poems, and dramas of wesetern culture to educate the reader on such literary concepts as Theme, Plot, Symbolisim, and various structures of short stories, poems, and plays. This book is easily understood by readers of many levels, andshould be enjoyed by all"
2,Some things should remain hidden,"We just returned from a trip to BC where we used this book in conjunction with others. Some of the information is useful, but time and time again we were disappointed, especially in the area of lodging. Several B&Bs and Lodges that were given very positive reviews were either very ordinary, motelish or were just plain dreadful. There is a good reason why these are hidden, and should remain so."
3,Hidden British Columbia,"Not a bad book that a few more maps and pictures would help complete. Great reviews of places and spots of interest. Recommend this book as a supplement to other travel books on these areas. More info on off road on the path, camping spots and hiking."
5,Mimi should appeal her fight action much more,"This is my favorite movie, and I like her fight action scene. But she (Mimi Lesseos) should appeal her fight action much much ... much more !!! I think she demonstrates only 10% of her fight skills."
2,A succint review,"I saw this movie some years ago. In terms of her acting capability, Mimi Lesseos makes Cynthia Rothrock look like Meryl Streep."
1,"""Streets of Mediocrity""","I bought ""Streets of Rage"" purely on the strength of the alleged director, the master Richard Elfman. To say the least, I was a bit upset to find out that he only co-wrote it. This was probably only to get into the star's pants. I hope it worked, because this movie was poo."
2,Below Average Chopsocky fare,"Once again, the acting in this movie is of low quality. This time, Mimi plays a reporter trying to get the story straight on runaways in Hollywood.She runs into trouble, and karates her way out of it. I'm not sure what the producers and Mimi were thinking when they did this movie. I fast forwarded through most of this movie; the only thing I really looked at to be honest was Mimi's half hearted attempt to present a **** scene! There's really nothing good for me to write to try to endorse this movie: it is just bad. Sorry Mimi, but you're just another pretty face making a weak attempt to make dismal movies!"
3,Fell apart after a few play sessions,"I have a very playful Miniature Pinscher, so to preface I will say that not many toys last around here. But it was not long at all until my little Polo had this fleecy ball completely unraveled. And trust me, when it begins to unravel, you see who intricately this thing is put together! I haven't taken it away from him yet, because it doesn't appear to be dangerous, but I have had to resort to tying all the separate, little strings into knots upon knots so that they continue to be connected in a big ball. For non-aggressive chewers, it may be fine, but beware that this DEFINITELY cannot be used as a tug toy!"
2,Hard to Open/Close,"Print on the umbrella is very cute, but it is difficult to open and very difficult to re-fold so that it fits into its carrying case."
1,A review from a kid,"(...) I bought this toy with my own money. It's not very much fun. It can shoot discs pretty good but you can't take the batman out, the wings don't move or any other parts on the jet. Also the wings look like they will snap off and many parts are wiggly. The discs jam and you have to dump them all out and unjam it.I wish I had saved my money for a cooler toy."
1,This game Did Not Work,We Tried To make it Run But Didint Run Its Nothing but a Peice of Garbage Please If you are fan Of FPS's stay awayFrom this Game it Gave you alto of ProBlems
4,My kid's birthday present,He tells me likes it and tries to play when time permits. He's 15 yrs old.
3,Narrow fit,"This shoe has a more narrow fit than other Rockport shoes I have bought. I thought the buckle was functioning, but it is not. The silver color is darker than I would describe silver; it's more like a gun metal. The shoe is also not as comfortable (in terms of heel/shock absorption) as other Rockport shoes (and I'm talking about dress shoes).Fortunately, Amazon sent me the wrong color, and would not allow me to purchase the correct color for the same price, so I am happy to no longer own them."
4,Good shoe - Narrow fit,"The shoe runs true to size length wise, but it does seem to be a little narrow. It is comfortable, and the heel is sturdy."
5,good class action,"This is what university work should be like: a professor leading a group of studnets in common action and collectieley publishing their work. Well done. Lots of good points which the unholy trinity should answer in some forum or other. All three organs are dominated by the US as Stiglitz, Bellamy and others have pointed out. Whether US hegemony is a good or bad thing is a different question.I felt the book could have done without Foucault, who has little to contribute on the parameters of discourse or much else. The fact is the budgets of these institutions dwarf all others and it makes a welcome change to see an articulate counter point of view, especially as it was a grassroots student project. Definitely worth a read."
5,Long History,I used to eat this from the age of 7. Loved it then and still now. It has a nutty flavor thats great and very healthy.
5,Exploring African Influences in modern music,Justin Adams has definitely spent time studying the texture of traditional African music. YOu can hear strong influences from the likes of Ali Farke Toure and King Sunny Ade. There are some tracks that have a really bluesy feel to them while others sound much more traditional. If you are interested in African polytrhythms and how they influence modern music...you won't be dissapointed.
4,"Great techno sampler, but very disco sounding","Techno instrumental. Kraftweit's ""Deranged"" has some cool sound effects. Many artists (17) represented in this collection, a good way to try them out. Beat is a little too disco-soft for my hard rock taste, but it offers a light, high energy sound, great for dance/workouts. (If anyone knows of any INDUSTRIAL-techno, please drop me a line!"
5,So glad I picked this album up.,Tower was closing so they had a clearance sale and I ended up randomly picking up a bunch of cds and this was one of them and I'm soo glad I got it. I've been listening to it non-stop. I'm going to pick up their other albums. Sound Team is my new favorite band.
5,major band,"I heard this album and was stunned. This is a great album by a totally unknown band. Why aren't people talking about these guys? I saw them live in San Francisco and they were a great live band too. All the songs are solid and it's a unique sounding band. If they were from Toronto maybe people would say this is the next Radiohead. My favorite song is ""Your Eyes Are Liars."" Every song is really great. Sound Team is the band of the future. I really hope that more people can experience this band live. I hope to see them more. Spread the word. I guess they already opened for Arcade Fire, and blew them off the stage. So they have a Next Big Thing vibe. But they are from Texas. Maybe that is holding them back? This record is somewhere between indie classic and major blockbuster. It's very hot today."
4,alot better then what pitchfork thinks...,"So I went to Pitchfork media's website and they gave this album a horrible score...I couldn't really understand why, as there are alot of albums that I haven't liked that everyone else has...and this is one of the few albums that I've actually really really enjoyed...so i went here and saw that everyone was giving it five stars...Right on. I would too, but I haven't really got to know the album that well yet..just on the few first listens, I know this is something special. You should defintely give this one a try...I have a very good taste in music that most people can agree with.Islands are forever."
2,Another mediocre band,Mediocrity lives! Weak vocals! Can the rave reviewers mention why this is supposedly such a great CD? It's so frustrating that so many people settle for so little.
1,BORING!!,"22 minutes of footage from the aftermath of Sept. 11th. 22 minutes of dust, broken windows and debris. 22 minutes with NO narration. 22 minutes of wasted time, in my opinion.The only people who would appreciate this dull and repetative documentary, are the people of New York. I say this only because they know the city well, and this DVD is simply 22 minutes of images of their shattered streets. No human drama or personal stories. No images of the attack. Again, just 22 minutes of the streets of New York in ruins.BORING! Save your money, or better yet, get CNN's DVD on the events of Sept. 11th. A much better choice."
3,Yet another disappointed viewer,"I would have given it two stars, or even only one star, but I was struck by the silence of the city in the aftermath of the disaster. The evening and night footage is positively eerie. Otherwise, the film was short and unimpressive. You can find similar things online for free."
1,Big Event-Big Disappointing DVD,I was anticipating a summary of the news reporting on the event as it unfolded. This is an unnarrated DVD with at best average video. Save your money!
2,Not worth buying,I purchased this DVD expecting a completely different film. This is not the 2 hour documentary I appreciated so much on television. While this is well done I cannot recommend this video.
1,Not what I expected......,"This is mostly what we've seen before, no commentary, and only a few minutes long. As previous reviewers stated, save your money."
2,Dont Bother,"I bought this dvd..I was hoping for a little more I guess..The dvd was less than one hour..it showed little more than fireman walking around in soot..I wasnt looking for gory details but a little more on the human side would have been good. I watched the ""enhanced"" version hoping to see more..I have seen better videos on nightly news channels.My advise is save your money and look elsewhere..the title is true..first 24 hours..but if you remember there was no power and no people..this is what you see."
2,disappointed,"I was responsible for buying this video for a middle school Social Studies class. What a mistake! Imagine teenagers sitting through this film....and besides, why try to make ""art"" from what is surely one of the most tragic disasters in our history? It may be my fault that I missed the fact that this was not a conventional documentary, and it may have cinematic merits (judging from the Sundance festival blurb), but as supplemental instruction: teachers and students, beware!"
2,misled by promotions,"I purchased this dvd from the historical Society of NY after missing, the CBS documentry hosted by Robert Deniro about the 2 Firemen starting work in NYC.. When it did arrive some friends talked me out of watching it because living so close to ground zero it may be upsetting, because i lost some friend there. well I finally watched it after the HBO special to see a close up view of the NYFD at work. Well having gone online for one thing i received another..there is very little sound, no narration, and to me looks like a bucnh of cutting room scraps tossed together. Boring to be blunt, and i saw more from my local news. What happened to the documentry that I went on to The First 24 hrs web site for"
2,Cold,"Although the opening segment of this film shows a couple of jumpers and one of the towers down, the vast majority of this is just shots of the devastation and the beginnings of the rescue and clean-up with no music or narration of any kind. The filmmakers may have thought both of those intrusive(and in some 9/11 videos they have been) but the absence of both here made this rather cold and unemotional, almost 9/11 as work of art. There is nothing here about what 9/11 did to people."
5,"Great gadget, Old one broke, they relaced it, FREE","I wrote a review last year where I LOVED the original product, but it broke. Or should I say, I BROKE IT. (I pumped it too hard). I wrote to the Vacu Vin folks, they issued me a return code and after many months, I finally remembered to ship it back to them. They very quickly reshipped me a BRAND NEW, IMPROVED UNIT, FREE. This is the new more square, sturdier unit. I need to be sure not to over pump it and hand wash it. What a great company that really stands behind their products. I can't say that about too many places today. This must-have kitchen gadget is fantastic. My DH is a hunter and I have lots of tough cuts of game meat to cook. This marinator makes my life much easier and makes me look like a great cook. BUY IT"
1,"Great idea, bad implementation","I bought this item to store cereal and coffee as we've had trouble with those little pantry moths. The concept was great and my Dad & I were both very excited to try the product. The problem is that this product is just not user friendly and not easy to use.The first time my Dad, who is 80, tried to vacuum seal the top, he broke the lid. Since I had 2 lids, we swapped the lid out and then I would vacuum out the air out of the container. I had trouble with the lid, too. Getting the pump placed just right and then ""fiddling"" would commence until the pump was in the appropriate placement before air removal commenced. This morning my dad again attempted to seal and vacuum the air out of the cereal container, again, with no luck.I don't recommend this product. It's not user friendly and requires an awful lot of work to get it to function the way it's supposed to work."
4,New Design,These are the best vacuum marinators for the money. One of mine came with a defect where the fill hole had not been fully drilled out. I drilled it out and it works fine. The pump is the easiest to hook up and use- no hookup needed. These hold vacuum for a long time so medium term storage is a second good use.
2,Beware - Contains BPA,"I opened the package (which arrived quite quickly), and as with all things plastic, I checked the recycling symbol to see what it was made of. To my horror, I saw 'pc' (polycarbonate) imprinted onto the bottom of the container, which means it contains bis-phenol-A (BPA). So, I am returning this item. What a shame. I'll have to look for another one which doesn't contain toxic plastics. They should just make them out of glass or stainless steel."
1,No Useful Life.,"No gurantee. Manufacturer will not stand behind product. Purchased few years ago. Product imploded upon initial test. Manual does suggest nor warn user that over pumping the pump to create the vacum can cause the plastic container to break (implode). The product itself does not offer enough resistance nor give indications when to stop extracting air to form the vacum inside to marinate the meat. Contacted manufacturer for replacement. Manufactuer refused to replace product while it was still new. Never had a chance to test product on meat. Spent over $30 (probably close to $40). I would not give this product any stars. But I'm forced to give it at least one star. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT! SAVE YOUR MONEY! No matter how favorable the reviews. If the product does not last and the manufacturer does not stand behind what it sells, the product is USELESS."
2,Quality has gone downhill,"I had one of these for 4-5 years and it worked great week after week, then it cracked. After tht amount of time it was a no brainer, I was a believer and ordered a new one. It was the same model I had all those years and it ended up cracking like the 3rd time I used it. Too bad it was an excellent product at one time, but way too pricy to give another try."
4,Vacu Vin Instant Marinater,"This marinater does a great job in tenderizing meats, sometimes in a relatively short period. I recommend this product."
2,"Good Pump, Mediocre Bowl Design","I had a much older marinator but it finally broke after many years, so I ordered this one. The pump has greatly improved; so much easier. But the bowl has a very stupid design. The bottom of the bowl is not level...it's ""humped"" whereby the middle section is raised and the area near the edges (where the bottom of the bowl meets the sides) are much lower. I don't get the reasoning behind this! So, part of the meat (the portion that's against the edge) is in the marinade, but the remaining portion of the meat (the part that's not shoved against the edge) doesn't touch the marinade unless you pour a HUGE amount of marinade in the bowl to fill up the entire bottom. Dumb design. I wish I knew this feature before I bought it, but the picture doesn't reveal this."
1,INSTANT MARINATING SYSTEM,WORKED WELL THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. AFTER THAT ITS WORTHLESS. DOESNT HOLD THE VACUUM. BIG GIMMICK. I WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER ONE. VERY DISAPPOINTED.
2,A Cautionary Note,"I think that when you pull ""too strong"" a vacuum and then put the INSTANT MARINATER into the REFRIGERATOR, the container IMPLODES. I believe what happened was that the volume of what little air was left in the Instant marinater ""shrunk"" due to the colder temperature of the refrigerator, increased the strength of the vacuum and that the sides of the container were not strong enough to withstand the forces.Or maybe it was because there were some scratches on the surface of the container that was enough to sufficiently weaken the container wall. I was cleaning the item with a soft sponge and non-abrasive liquid dishwashing soap.Before this incident, I had done the same as above (meat into Instant Marinader, pulled vacuum and put in refrigerator) without any problems.I think this item has a nice concept, but that the materials could have been stronger. Another idea would be to have some sort of mechanism to prevent ""too strong"" of a vacuum pull."
1,Don't waste your money,This item is a piece of junk!!When you seal it the airpressure is so tight that you can not release it to remove the lid. The valve malfunctioned after the 2nd use.A waste of money!!!
4,Works Great,This container works really well. Pulling out all the air really helps the marinade penetrate the meat. The container is large and dishwasher safe so it makes it easy to use for everything. The only reason I give it 4 stars is the shape; the bottom of it curves up instead of being flat so whatever is directly in the middle doesn't get to soak in the marinade.
4,Life Saver,"My husband and I are those people that always want to marinate the meat for a long time but forget till its time for dinner. This item is wonderful and really gets the meat juicy and savory in an instant it seems. Our only complaint is that the bowl isnt flat. The design of the bowl just seems in a simple word, dumb. Maybe there's a reason for it but we just cant figure it out."
3,Works great but you need a lot of marinate,"I waited until I used this several time to post my review. The product works as expected but you need a lot of marinating liquid. For some reason they made the bottom of the container convex so you need more liquid than if had a flat bottom. I don't understand why they didn't use a flat bottom. For example, I marinated 6 steaks for 3 days (they were frozen when I started) and the bottoms were well marinated but the tops were not. Yes, you can open it up and flip the meat but shaking the container had little if any effect."
3,Worked sometimes,"The bowl worked great for the first couple months I used it, then I started having problems with the check valve holding pressure. Turned out it was the seal on the top that was not working the best. Ive had it for about a year now and can use it as a water bowl for the puppy. The top is completely useless. Also, be prepared to use a lot of marinade as the bottom of the bowl bulges inward."
2,C Minus for Effort,"Mr. Elling is obviously influenced by Mark Murphy. The main difference is that Murphy is a true jazz pioneer and Kurt Elling is all imitation. This is one of the most pretentious, affected recordings I have ever heard.Another difference: Murphy can sing in tune. Am I the only person who hears how bad Kurt Elling's intonation is? SQWAWK! I hear not ONE song where he stays entirely on pitch!"
5,can you believe this is his debut!?!?!,"kurt elling is amazing. his creative, and intriging voice knows no boundries. his band is great too. paul wertico's drumming on this cd is just AWESOME!!!! it complements the music so much. this is a great one to get, all the selections are perfect. i dont know what else to say, this is a perfect cd to get for your collection."
3,better today than then,"I adore Kurt Elling, but in this older work he sings sharp and it actually hurts my ears.Maybe the newer albums are fixed in the mix."
4,Survivor Manual,This book will get you started with phrases and proved a real survivor manual for me while traveling through France. The key to learning French is to try and speak it. I found this book helpful and encouraging...
4,lots of 1930's dixieland and Hawaiian potpourri,"I'm a haole in love with Hawaiian music and culture and also Louis Armstrong, so this is something I HAD to have.Louis Armstrong takes the spotlight on only 4 numbers. Three of his selections are tunes with sweet aloha and for the rest, you'd better like early Hawaiian and dixieland jazz. Hawaiian elements are a nice sampling of falsetto, slack key, steel guitar and chant. Sound quality is not perfect, but overall, it's very enjoyable and a good value."
1,way too small,"I was very happy with the company that sent this product, it arrived in a very timely manner, but the prop is alot smaller than i thought it would be and dose not work for the halloween prop i was planning for it. i did not return it though because it was no fault of the seller. I will just use the prop for indoor decoration."
2,"Only a few good exercises, too short a workout to be effective for most","Aside from a few ab exercises, which you would need to do more than the few reps the model does in order to get any real benefit from them, this workout is not very strenuous, except for someone who was completely sedentary to begin with. Some of the ab exercises are the type where if you do them quickly, as the model does, you are using your back and neck muscles, not your ab muscles, which defeats the purpose of the exercise.The music on the DVD is very annoying, a very short loop played over and over. Many of the exercises seem to be right out of Callanetics, which has a much, MUCH better 15-minute workout in the book of the same name. Also, the chaptering left a lot to be desired--the exercises were all in a single chapter, not broken down by body section worked. If this had been done, I would have given it another star.Worth a rental, not a purchase, unless you can get it inexpensively used."
4,Plenty music for the money . . . not much worship melody,"A very good compilation and good buy with 3 CDs total of 40 songs, you can't go wrong. While the songs are mostly among the popular worship songs today it would've been nice to see couple others like Holy, holy in there. My biggest disappointment with the CD though is the versions/melodies of the songs. They are not the ones you hear playing mostly on radio and I find too much instruments in some of them with the words getting lost/drowned out. If you're looking for an all out worship (mediation, reach out & praise type) this is not your CD but for everyday playing in the car, office etc. this will do the trick."
5,Amazingly!,"This CD is a masterpiece. In general, I like Rock and Roll, nevertheless I adore the songs of this album, mainly ""A Girassol Da Cor De Seu Cabelo"". The beauty of the lyrics of this song is impressive. I'm amazed when I listen her. But the whole CD is amazingly. No doubt, if Milton Nascimento had issued only this album, even so, he could be considered a genius."
1,Latent Pedaphile,"The very unreverend and unholy John H. Walker writes like a pedophile. Indeed, in his book he tells us that he is a latent pedophile. I would not be a bit suprised if he masturbated whilst he was writing it. His book is sickening beyond belief. He has written this book for own sexual gratification whilst exploring his own pedophilic fantasies, and it has no basis in any known fact to what happened to JonBenet Ramsay. It is appallingly written and it appears the publishers could not run to the cost of a proof reader. The idea that this man could make money out of this disgusting book is sickening. I suggest that someone at Amazon is given the unenviable task of reading it immediately and that it be withdrawn from sale. I never thought that I would agree with censorship of any kind but this book has shown me that there are times when censorship is right. I was unable to submit this review without putting in a star rating. However, I do not really rate it in any way shape or form."
2,Not the best,I forgot i ordered this book as it took over a month to come and the book cover shown on the profile isnt the actully cover.The only way i think was good was the package and the good used condition
5,Awsome,"I love this book. It is so exciting! All of the small details, like the borrowed water bucket, lead up to the biggest race of Alic Ramsey's life. Which stallion is fastest?"
5,Black Stallion and Satan,I especially enjoyed the comparisons of the two horses and how Alec deals with both of them. I would think anyone who likes the Black Stallion books would like this one
4,Underrated,"The main complaint about this movie is that the depiction of Irish terrorism is unrealistic. So what, that's not even what the movie is really about. The movie is about what you would do if you figured out that someone you had accepted into your home had been lying to you all along and had even put your family in danger. This concept creates an entertaining film and makes up for the few unrealistic scenes in the beginnning."
1,Just Awful.,"Not being a Brad Pitt fan period, I knew I was in for a real 'treat' once I came to realize that he would be displaying his 'amazing' acting skills with an Irish accent to boot. I knew this movie was doomed right then and there. And I was right. My goodness what an awful movie. I mean I can't even tell you wtf was going on cuz I was too busy being annoyed with/laughing at Pitts accent and all of the bad acting. Wow, never has a non comedy made me laugh so hard. Heck most comedies don't even make me laugh this hard.Needless to say, I don't know what happens in this movie, I don't even think I could fall asleep to it. I think I actually turned it off, pissed off that I had wasted so much time (45 minutes) watching this crapfest. On the good side, I now randomly laugh about this movie and tell people to rent it if they are ever in the mood to laugh at one of the worst movies ever.I really don't know how this movie made it past the script stage of the game."
1,A weak and disappointing film.,"This was a boring and disappointing film. When I saw the theatrical trailer prior to its release into theatres, it obviously looked like a dynamic and exciting movie with a lot of action, like ""Patriot Games."" But when I saw it two months later in the theatre, there was almost no action at all (that involves Harrison Ford). If the theatrical trailer had shown that this is a movie with a story, I would have viewed this film with less disappointment."
1,Very simplified movie,"The Best part is the end when you see the credits. Brad Pitt's character wallowed in self-pitty throughout the entire movie. The movie also seemed very dumbed down, ""I'm excused for killing people because somebody else did something..."". I didn't feel sorry for his character and the movie was just too slow. If it's a choice between this or watching paint dry, go with the paint, this one might insult your intelligence."
1,It's an Ammurkan film not an Oirish one.,"In this, perhaps the worst film ever about Northern Ireland, we see the true arrogance of the Hollywood film machine. They take one of the world's political hotspots as background, twist the situation in a ridiculous and inflammatory way, and then market this bilge in the sure knowledge that the American public is too stupid to know better and that foreigners are either star-struck morons or will just have to lump it. The preposterous action sequences alone should have been enough reason for the execs to get out of their hot tubs long enough to cancel this project but perhaps that would have messed up their hair. This is a film that leaves no cliche unturned in its fevered depiction of Oirland including the reluctant but noble urban terrorists, the lovely redheaded Colleens that love them, and the annoying pipe music that follows them everywhere: it's a sap's paradise."
2,If you're THAT bored...,"Alright if you are supremely bored, but Brad Pitt with a fake Irish accent..he he ,um, okay whatever."
2,Ehh.... ok,"This was definitely an odd movie. The plot wasn't too clear for me, but the fact that the DVD I have of it, has an error in it, probably doesnt help (it replays the first chapter over and over in loop LOL)It was hard for us to know why he was doing what he was doing, where the money came from, who this mobster was, and so on.... like...all right. And now he has his own boat too.... it was all just a bit odd LOL a lot of info was unspoken or skipped.Another reviewer made the good point that the film highlights the contrast of a happy versus a bitter family life; while I agree, the fiml was itself very bland and had little to no dramatic or emotional value or impact. I wasnt moved or anything, I was just slightly occupied (and a bit baffled) for 107 minutes."
4,The Devil's Own,I don't like to tell the story of the movie. I feel that it is something for you to see. This movie touched my feelings on the plight of a situtation that has been going on for years with no end in sight. In the fight that is still raging today in another country brings and individual who thinks he can make a difference into our own country to purchase items they believe will help them and the extremes that a person will go through to help his country and cause to win the war they have been fighting all their lives for.
3,"Wonderful dialouge, horrid plot","There are so many aspects of Devil's Own that I really really like! But there are some really bad plot flaws that I desperately wish could be corrected. Firstly, the story begins introducing these characters (For instance, a member the British Intellegence unit who murders an IRA man) that end up having little sugniffiance to the story line. As it is, the whole plot is VERY unrealistic-- down right tacky in some places as it begins to slip into a typical Harrison Ford action flick. But if that can be over-looked (and let's face it, plot is pretty important to a film), it's a pretty good movie. The dialouge is absolutely marvolous-- lines which will stick with you all throughout your life. One in particular, I believe, sums up the whole movie: ""Don't be looking for happy endings, Tom, it's not an American story, it's an Irish one."""
1,I wanted a different ending,"When Hollywood finally chooses to make a movie about the struggles, it of course chooses to tell us that even though those nasty Prods have no problem killing our people in cold blood, obtaining the arms to fight back is wrong and must be stopped by Captain America aka Harrison Ford. Please spare me from this awful movie. Shades of Tom Clancy and the rest of the UK suck ups in Hollywood. How would they like it if Malibu was taken over by ""gasp"" republicans andresidency was limited to non-actors and they had to live in San Bernadino?"
1,hahahahahahah,"My laughter is due to the quote in the previous guys review ""Shows he(Brad Pitt) cant act."" what a joke. did you listen to the accent. his accent was closer to chinese than irish. no aspect of this movie was watchable."
3,The devil at home!,"This is a worthy to watch film, because we are talking about Alan Pakula, one of the most talented and intelligent American directors of his generation who bet for a script of beating actuality.A young Irish terrorist goes to New York in order to broke an arms deal and get room just at home of a very honest cop (who has not the minor idea whom is lodging).The plot resents itself, specially in what concerns the predictable final. But the initial shooting sequence is now a cult reference.Brad Pitt is credible as the ruthless terrorist and Ford is at top level with this hard role, on one hand he has to cover a grievous mistake of his partner and the other he will have to deal with the disillusion of having lodged an outlaw of such importance, widely wanted in Europe.Above the average, but the script had by itself major stamina to expose."
5,Luxury Overdose,"... What can you say when you hear this album?... no words can express all the feelings that these songs can put on your soul. Your ears will be shocked with the texts that OLVIDO-Alaska-GARA sings with her magical voice. Voice that is in a grace state thanks to the production of NACHO CANUT and Carlos Jean.This album was the new beginning of FANGORIA, the chance to the most of the public to recapture them.Songs like ""EL GLAMOUR DE LA LOCURA"" or ""ELECTRICISTAS"" (a strange hit that time has turned into a little classic.Forget press reviews that compare FANGORIA with PET SHOP BOYS, new MADONNA or BJÖRK... FANGORIA's sound is unique.Dont miss the chance.Dont miss the sound.Dont miss FANGORIA."
2,Finicky and refuses to play many tapes,"I actually bought two versions of this by mistake - one was branded Quasar, and was very cheap but gave me problems, so I went and bought a brand name - and found it was the identical model (poor memory of what the Quasar looked like when I was in the store)! Even the instruction manual was identical - just the brand name changed.The controls are all fine and when it records the quality is fine, but it refuses to play many commercial tapes - just ejects them, gets them stuck on loading and I've had to take the top off a couple of times. These are the same problems I had with the Quasar branded one. A real shame, as I believed Panasonic did high quality goods until now. I am shopping for another one and trying to guess the price that you have to pay to get something that works."
2,Fun while it lasted...,"The features and picture quality of this VCR are great. Commercial advance is lovely, but sometimes it gets confused and zaps through regular programming by mistake--but it's accurate 90% of the time. After all the recording is done, the VCR will re-wind and then re-play the shows you just taped, marking where commercials started and stopped. This is annoying if you want to use the machine, because you CAN'T while this is going on. VCR-plus made life easier too.Unfortunately this unit died after only 18 months. I think that the commercial advance system put so much strain on the motor that it just wore out. We tape about 5 hours of network programming a week (Raymond, Frasier, West Wing, Friends, ER, The Practice) and then on the weekends we catch up on our favorite shows. I guess that was enough to kill it. Poor little thing. (I paid close to $180 for it--look how cheap it is now!)"
1,PIECE OF JUNK,I purchased this VCR after reading some of the postive reviews on this site. It worked for 1 day and then began a strange whirring noise when I turned the power on and would not recognize that it had a tape in it and then would just cut off. I am returning it tomorrow for my money back. I should have known it was crap when I took it out of the box and it weighed about a pound. My old Magnavox VCR was of a substantial weight and lasted 10 years of continuous use. I spent $95 on this Panasonic and would recommend spending your money on something else.
2,Great Features - Very Unreliable,"The ""commercial advance"" feature on this machine is worth it's weight in gold. Offsetting this, reliability is very poor: four times back to the dealer for service in the first four months. Tape handling was the main problem.Finally, I got the dealer to agree to replace the unit. But he would not give me another Panasonic like this: he gave me a new Sony.Make sure you have an extended warranty if you buy this unit - or get another brand."
1,Don't lose your remote!,"I bought two of these units (at the time I found nothing but glowing reviews.) I lost the remote to one unit, and the other remote quit working. No problem, get a universal remote, right? Well, good luck finding one where you can change the recording speed. When the unit is unplugged, the default goes to SP. I want EP, and the only way to get that mode is with the remote. So I have a VCR that only plays, unless I want to waste VHS tapes. And it doesn't play all that well, to be honest. I have tapes that I recorded from another VCR (now busted) that played fine on it...and I get a lot of bad playback with those tapes on this unit."
1,No Good!,"I bought this VCR more than a year and a half ago,I thought it was a good buy,but now I can't even watch or record anything on it because the picture quality is poor & the picture keeps bouncing.Buyer beware!"
5,Great quality,"This is a solid stereo VCR. I haven't used any of the so-called advanced features, because I just use it to tape a few TV programs and play back old VHS tapes. Everything works great. The unit I received was assembled in Malaysia, not Japan, but the build quality is very decent. My other Panasonic VCR (non-stereo) has lasted over 12 years. I think this newer one will last another good long time."
2,Not so good,"After I bought this the first time I found out that their was a major problem with this unit and Panasonic had to fix like a jillion of these things. If you look around you will see this model and the PV-V4622 for sale everywhere as ""reconditioned"".This machine works great except for a few major problems.1. This unit does not accept all types of VCR tapes. I bought a package of 10 tapes from Costco and 3 wouldn't work with this machine. No reason just wouldn't work. About 3-4 other brands flat won't work.2. When you record at any speed other then the best you have to constantly adjust the tracking every minute.I have owned much better VCRs. I have a Panasonic TV/VCR combo and it is the best tv and vcr I have ever owned. .."
3,Decent praise hymnal,"The songs in this hymnal are intended to be uplifting and upbeat. However, many of these songs have much syncopation (offset in timing) and can be very difficult to learn by those not used to syncopation. The music itself is uncluttered and has the recommended chords, lyrics, and tempo. It does not have an F-cleft or harmony notes, though. If you play an instrument, a book holder is a MUST!!! This book will fight with you, otherwise, when trying to play an instrument!"
4,Light and Functional,"I purchased this to use for washing my dog in a walk-in shower, and now I also use it all the time to sit down for shaving my legs or washing my feet in the shower. Can't believe I never thought of having a bench in a shower before. This should be also marketed as a shower bench. It's light and sturdy and was simple to assemble. Would have given it 5 stars except that (1) they don't tell you that you'll need a rubber hammer to assemble it and (2) even with a rubber hammer I needed help from my son to get all four tabs on the top of the vertical supports to click into the holes on the bottom of the bench."
2,Bench....,This bench was not what we expected and is now sitting on our deck. Turns over too easily (and we have had a couple of bumped heads) so people really don't like to sit on it.... I do not recommend this product.
4,Wobbles a bit...,"This arrived in a timely fashion, and was easy to but together, but it isn't very steady...it wobbles a bit and it makes me nervous to let my 3 1/2 year old sit on it! Oh well....."
3,Moodorama - Music For Collapsing People,"More pleasant downtempo from a label that specializes in it. Moodorama's second album, MUSIC FOR COLLAPSING PEOPLE, despite its title, is much sunnier than their first. ""Sinzing Sunset Boulevard"" is lounge-ready, while ""Loss of Sense"" has a quick detour to Africa and ""Mango Mongo"" to Latin-America. American R&B gets a shout-out in ""Are U Comin'."" The centerpiece of this album is the fun and funky ""Viama,"" which switches gears from a upbeat little number into some dark acid breaks, then back again (but this time with whistles and a melodic synth line that's all smiles.) This, unfortunately, is followed by the lame rap of ""My Vibe."" The mood darkens some on the latter half of the album, as evidenced by ""Uncertainty"" and ""Mono Luv."" Nice, but not outstanding."
3,"Amazing "" Mindless Moments 3 "" !","One day my young brother came to me claiming that I had to listen a song from a new CD he'd just bought... It was the 10th of this CD. I've been so amazed that I went listening to it 5 times ! The thing is that compared to this song, the rest of the CD is just correct in my opinion. Lots of nice rythms, but the music sounds still a bit repeatitive. Anyway, "" Mindless Moments 3 "" needs to be listened to."
4,Wow!,"This is an awesome book! Sibbes examines suffering, sin, and the victory of Christ over it all! In his own words, ""our comfort is that Christ lives and reigns, and stands on Mount Zion in defence of those who stand for him."" This is the basic thesis of his book."
2,The Puritans could think and pray but they couldn't write,"The Puritans had a lot of great spiritual advice to give. The problem is that most of them couldn't write worth a darn. Most of them tend to read like boring and obscure academics (just try to get through a chapter of John Owen without wondering if you are reading gibberish). Sibbes is an awful writer. He's vague, repetitive, dry as a cracker, and what he says could be condensed into ten pages. For great reformed writing, try A. W. PInk's Sovereignty of God. Pink's writing crackles and pops and he writes as vigorously as Luther."
4,"Not fun, but educational","I watched ""The Conscious Acts Of Creation - The emergence of a new physics"" by Dr. William A. Tiller, Phd, one of the guys on the What the Bleep and the Down the Rabbit hole movies. To those who say the science of concentrated intentions with emotion not doing anything - they have 3 boring experiments, such as using yogis to change the ph of water, or make fruit flys grow faster, etc. The amazing thing is - they had to keep the control samples in faraday cages - if they did not, the (eg) ph would change on both samples - as if the 2 samples were lnked! Lots of boring physics - and lots of subjective thinking - but, all in all, it does give lots of science to the topics covered in ""What the Bleep"", the ""Secret"", religions, and conditoning one's mind. Not a funny movie or a fun one, it's a lecture that is boring but shows what we always suspected - at least leads us to what we already kind of knew!"
1,Horrible. I mean it. Yeeks.,"I watched this guy give me some great information and insight on the movie, ""What the Bleep do we know?"". I was really excited to get this to learn more about what he had to say. Wow. Ummmmm.... It is an AV Club basic video of a classroom lecture.The subject matter lost me very, very quickly. I am totally for creating your own reality and everything, so I guess the people in this video must be on a really high level of understanding the fabric of the Universe if anything he was saying made sense to them during that lecture. Good job guys! I think I'm not quite on your level yet so I'll have to pass on this video until a few more lifetimes from now."
2,Conscious Acts of Creation,"I'm a big fan of ""What the Bleep"" and ""The Secret"" but the scientific edge of this was a little to technical and lacked the entertainment value."
5,Kev is a musical freak!! Terrific! Scaring!,"Simply you have to own it. A phenomenal trio, with a phenomenal guitarist. Yes, I'm talking about that strange character who plays during the Jay Leno show. You can't imagine (if you don't already own Guitarist or Dave Holland's Extensions) what kind of monster musician Kevin Eubanks is. I hope he will concentrate again on music and give us more of his guitar playing to listen. I dream of new serious albums from him. I can't get enough of this compact disc. Be sure to buy also the two titles cited before and World trio with Dave Holland and Mino Cinelu, where kev plays only the acustic guitar. What a tremendous musician!!! Terrific!!! A true musical freak!"
3,Good value but loud motor noises.,"The first Audiovox D1988 I purchased arrived quickly from Amazon. It was a pleasant looking unit with controls that were accessible and intuitive. The screen was nice and the sound was acceptable. The only problem was the motor (that moves the laser) noise was excessive. It was necessary to turn the volume up just to drown out the motor noise. I have had a few other portable dvd units and the Audiovox was the noisiest. I exchanged the unit and the replacement is about 50% more quiet. I will probably shop around before purchasing my next unit. But, for the price, it is certainly acceptable."
2,This item is not zone/region free.,"I purchased this DVD player because I was led to believe it was zone free. I already have a portable DVD player, but wanted to be able to play gift DVDs from England. Very disappointed it would not play them. Sent it back, at my expense. Will think twice about ordering anything again. Lovely picture, but useless to me."
3,SHORT LIFE SPAN,"LOVED THIS DVD PLAYER SINCE IT TOOK A USB DRIVE AND SD CARDS BUT THIS UNIT LASTED ME EAXCTLY A YEAR. AFTER THE 1st YEAR THE LENS WENT BAD AND WOULDN'T READ ANY DVDS, EVEN TRIED A LENS CLEANER. 3 out of 5 stars. I PAID OVER $100 FOR THIS UNIT AND WAS HOPING IT HAD SOME LONGEVITY. SOUND AND PICTURE WAS GREAT BUT THE LENS MOVM'T WAS LOUD FROM PURCHASE."
4,Interesting lil book,This is a much smaller book than I expected.(more like a phamphlet really) Which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Still I found it an interesting easy read.
4,"Very good, explaing the basic, but... (read my review)","Basically this book is very good. It goes through the basic to some advanced techniques. The author tried to cover a lot of Operating Systems, from x86 (Windows and Linux) to Mac, Sparks and Cisco, so you should be aware whether this is your focus or not, if not you will take advantage of a few chapters of the book. In my case, I was interested just in x86 shellcode programming, so I should paid half of the price (just kidding). Also, it does not explain advanced techniques (such as code obfuscation, self-modification, etc), but it's very good for intermediate coders. Recommended."
3,Good material... bad editing,"While the material is good, there are way to many errors. For someone who's looking for the hows and whats of software exploitation, this book comes through. For someone who actually wants to follow their example code... good luck. Errors everywhere! I wonder how this book made it past the editors. I haven't come across a book like this in a long long time. The webpage also lacks much content save for the chapter code, some of which is faulty and will not run properly without modification.Get some new editors!"
3,"Good, but not ideal","This book serves as a good introduction to shell coding. The first 6 chapters on linux are reasonably complete; if you read the material and take the time to learn the concepts you will be happy with your progress. However, as the book dives into other operating systems I feel that some of this completeness and solidarity are vanishing. As I get deeper and deeper into the text, there are more and more words and concepts which are prerequisite yet the authors never explained. It feels like they were very comprehensive and diligent in the first chapters, but got lazy and impatient as it progressed."
2,Kindle Version Formatting Is Bad,"Only made it a couple of chapters. The problem is that the code listings have no line breaks; it's just all jammed together in one big blob of text (think minified javascript). Had to return it, but I didn't want to - what I could read was very good. 2 stars for the poor formatting...."
5,A great book about a great civilization.,"I was truly enlightened while reading this book. Not only did it give me new information, but it also got me interested in reading other books about the Greeks."
2,install,"uhmmm,it would really be nice if the instructions were'nt so vague. it does not explain where and how all the pieces fit together its pretty much all trial and error. it needs to explain in more detail to remove screws From the pedals in order to put the brackets ON..."
2,still walking,Still Walking: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray] (2008)this blu ray is just one disc and not two as the site saysI have this movie and I get it because I thought it was doble disc as in japan 3.so! the movie is okay but the price is not good for just one disc
2,one of the most boring movies I've ever seen,"This is an indoor family drama about a Japanese family who still have yet to come to terms over the untimely death of a promising son, years before. The father is a retired doctor who hoped to bequeath his practice to his eldest son, but the latter died saving a complete loser from drowning. The remaining son hasn't risen to the occasion.I wouldn't be surprised to learn that this movie was adapted from a play: the action is all verbal, all internal. Why was this even a movie? It was serviceable material for a book, to be sure, but the element of film was poor soil for this material: one frequently finds oneself nodding off.It's a very Henry James sort of approach: all the ""action"" is internal, psychological. So far, so good. But the film fails for the same reason that films based on James's books usually fail: unless your action is visual, it's probably not a good idea to make a film of it. You're going to bore people."
5,One of the best films,"This is a modern version of Ozu'sTokyo Story (The Criterion Collection). If you haven't watched that old film, it is a family drama, in which grown-up children come back to visit their parents. ""Still Walking"" has exactly the same theme. It is an absolutely brilliant film if you are interested in this kind of film. I liked the film because it deals with expressed emotions, interpreted emotions, and true emotions. First thing to note is that it is very difficult to read the true emotions based on the expressed emotions. Second thing to note is that the Japanese have trouble interpreting the emotions of the other people as well. So it is not just a Westerner which have trouble with this. Even though, naturally, it doesn't get any easier if you don't know the culture. I'm not going to say more about the film. Just buy it and watch it."
2,Cheesy recreation,"I love a good 80's remix,but this is just wrong. You wait and wait and wait for it to get better as it plays along, but it does not. The remixes are barely recognizable and at best function as somewhat familiar. ""Come on Eileen"" and ""West End Girls"" are sung by a female performer which sounds more like a kareoke knock off. I suggest to let this 80's recreaton to not only live in oblivian, but take up permanent residence!"
3,NOT a review,"I have NOT read this book and make no judgements about it as a whole, but I would like to amplify the author's statement that H. Bruce Franklin's analysis of Robert Heinlein was ""Marxist"". I took a college class from Franklin in 1974 - the man was a damn Maoist (when it was still possible to be a Maoist)!"
2,Good book For Beginners,"This book is Full of Information on Soul Healing But Only Information Nothing else.It is Good For Beginners But IF you know enough or already read books Then this one is not for 'You'.It seems while reading that,Author took very much care to advertise his book 'Past Lives,Future lives' & Himself.Sorry,but Not gonna work.I expected lot more than this."
1,Not nearly as good as the first one,"The first one is awesome - we play it over and over, so much that I wanted the variety of the sequel. But none of the songs are anywhere near as catchy. I can barely make myself play it for my toddler."
2,A bit of a snoozer...,"We have the original For the Kids, and we absolutly love it. It's one of our daughter's favorites, and ours too. So, we were excited to purchase this follow-up album. That excitement ended when we put it in the CD player. Most of the songs are rather somber and boring. If you're an indie fan, you might like it, but your kids will quickly lose interest. Buy the first one, if you don't have it, but don't bother with this one."
5,Music that we sing and dance to,"After getting the first CD and loving it, and then getting the second CD because of all the great reviews on Amazon, I have realized it was a smart move. Me and my daughter enjoy the majority of the songs, singing and dancing to them every time the CD's playing. I love the lyrics and music. It's kid's music that I can enjoy too."
5,Love the Meow Meow Song!!!,I was cruising the iTunes store on my iPhone and typed meow in the search box for no reason and came across this cd and the Meow Meow Lullaby song by Nada Surf and loved it. I started to listen to the other tracks and was hooked. Very cool and fun music that works for both children and adults with no worries of throwing the cd through the window because of some annoying voices coming at you. ;)
4,Four and a half actually...,"This would've been a five, but I just can't get into the Rainbow Connection by Jason Mraz. However, the rest of the disc is great. Two highlights: I'm different, which my daughter can't get enough of, and Everybody Came. Buy it, your kids will love it."
1,Skip this album,"We are disappointed with this album. We loved the first For the Kids album, but this one is boring boring boring. My kids age 2 and 4 do not like it because there are no silly or funny songs like the first one."
2,Too Academic,"I enjoy reading sea stories such as ""Working on the Edge"", but it was a real chore to get through the maze of details which seemed to be included just to make the book 'thick' and did nothing to really add to the 'story'. Pass on this one and spend your money on something written as less of a text book."
4,Historical background and sea stories,John Rousmaniere relates the historical facts that surrounded each disaster and arranges the stories in historical sequence. This background information adds depth to the stories of sailing disasters by relating them to one another. We learn how sailing and attitudes toward sailing influenced the events of each disaster and we get a better understanding of the sailors involved.
5,The book about the mafia,"I had to work with this book in my studies in Italian language and it was a great pleasure for me to know this author. He describes brillantly the relations in the big family, where nobody owes to say a word about the big bosses and the crimes, which have happened. This silence, omertá, causes the power of the mafia. Regarding this system the officer gets frustrated, because there's no chance for him to arrest the big boss, which is evidently not innocent. My comment about this book is very positive and I could tell everybody to read it, too."
2,Very good. Occasional errors...,"At first, I was a bit disapointed at the minor editorial errors and typos that I encountered and it became apparent that things were not going to improve much as I moved through the book.I like the author. He has a very 'english' approach and his occasional use of real-life examples make the book more valuable than it should be.My main issue with this book are the errors that were encountered. These ranged from technical details to misspellings and grammar. Sheesh! The end-of-chapter exams (multiple choice) occasionally had typos in the answers where a character would make the difference between right and wrong.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone new at the material, but for an intermediate who can catch things that don't seem right, it might be worth it as the author is pretty good."
4,Great Resource!,This book greatly assisted me in preparing for the 70-218 exam. It went well beyond the scope of the certification objectives and offered valuable insight into concepts I need to know in my daily administration.
1,A useless title,"This book completely misses the boat. It's hit or miss with Osborne, and this book is a miss. I find the content elementary at best, and useless when it comes to actually preparing for the exam."
2,Bias against German general staff,"Overall the book could have been a great estimate of the military capability of german armies, but the author seems to have an agenda against the german general staff.Some aspects of the criticism like the aristocracy and the lack of appreciation of modern infantry tactics might have some truth in it, but the accusation that germans lagged behind in artillery is quite shocking to say the least.If nothing else the author should have consulted general Herr's book ( insecptor general of french artillery).Herr clearly points out the superority of german heavy artillery and howitzers.Even in terms of field artillery the diffrence was not so significant as is claimed by the author."
1,Myth of the Technophobes,"The Kaiser's Army is rigorously researched but horribly analyzed. Brose blames feudalistic, blue-blooded, aristocratic, reactionary technophobes and the middle-class bourgeois who aped them for supposedly ignoring the impact of technology in the pursuit of chivalric glory (yes, Brose actually uses quasi-marxist terminology to the point of parody). The author does not seem to understand the practical issues involved in resolving the paradoxes between dispersion and tactical control, or decentralization and coordination, all without handy and reliable radios.Echevarria's After Clausewitz was actually published before The Kaiser's Army, but feels like a successful refutation of Brose's effort. Spend your money there."
2,Flawed,"The most blatant trait of Brose is his exceedingly negative portrayal of the German forces. To argue that the reason for Germany's' defeat rests on decades of slow acceptance of new technology is foolish. For instance, Brose fails to mention the superiority of German heavy artillery during the first few years of the Great War. Furthermore, it appears Brose is incapable of writing Kaiser Wilhelm II when referring to the German monarch. Calling the monarch Kaiser William is nothing short of arrogance.If you want a fair assessment of the Imperial German Army look elsewhere."
2,Too small,"When I ordered this book I had no idea what ""miniature"" meant. I thought they were referring to the size of the book, not the print size of the words..."
5,Note the word MINIATURE,"This is a well bound, quite nice paperback copy of the full score of Messiah. But be warned, this is not a book one would prop on their piano to play. It is small and will not lay open. Even though it was not what I expected, I still like it very much."
5,Sonic Genius,"What else can be written about Miles Davis, a man years ahead of his time. This good music sounds cutting edge 40 years after its initial release...it's amazing stuff. Liberating, intellectual,satisfying and challengingly complex like no other, remarkable !"
2,Inconsistent,"This album features really long jams on five compositions. There are good moments, but there are also stretches where the musicians seem to be searching for a groove or just repeating a figure. The performances could have been edited down to about one third their length and had greater impact. This is from Miles' unusual electric period, which some people like a lot, but which many people find abrasive and dull. It's a matter of personal taste. One could love the pre-1968 acoustic Miles and have no use for this music. Others like it all. This is strong stuff--you have to either go away or go all the way in."
2,Leftovers,"Of the studio albums from Miles' electric period, this is by far the weakest. Check out In A Silent Way (expanded), BBrew and Get Up With It before listening to this one."
5,This guy is CRAZY!,"This book is basically a diary of Boonstra's long adventure tours. Some of the conditions he rides in are extremely harsh, and made me think that he was crazy for continuing. I read this book cover to cover, but you don't need to. Each of his trips is a separate chapter. I would definitely recommend reading the first two Alaska trips; it is during these trips that he is learning about adventure touring and he has the most interesting experiences (from a riding standpoint). On his second trip, he gets cought in a blizzard and also does quite a bit of riding in the snow! It was worth the read and really opened my eyes to what you can do on a motorcycle."
3,Not what I had hoped,"I was very happy to finally receive my copy and started out with high hopes. Unfortunately it did not show enough of the living conditions aboard the vessels of this time period. We were given a brief view of the Captains quarters and all of the comfort but never got to see the gun decks, galley or living conditions for the average sailor. To much time was spent on various authors hawking their novels.Sailors lives were tough in those days and not just aboard the First Rates but the smaller craft. I was hoping to see more of this. Very disappointed!!"
4,sea warriors,A good DVD. There is a lot of information here if you wonder about the old days of sail.
1,Worst yoga video ever,"This is not like most yoga videos - it is not about yoga practice, at least not in the same way. It's more a meditation. It should be called that. I was expecting a program that would wake me up, not send me to sleep!"
5,Remember...?,"....Remember that scene in Star Wars when C-3PO kinda ""wakes up"" amongst the other droids within the Jawas sand cruiser? Well,if some of those droids wiped the rust from their sleepy eyes and began wrappin' in some alien tongue,to the tune of some 90's-era Electronica from a Rave in a galaxy far,far away well it might sound somethin' like this."
4,"It may be early Monk, but this is good stuff!","It's bebop, but it's Monk. He runs his fingers down the keyboard alot, & yet it gasses me every time. Milt Jackson is featured prominently. It may be early Bags, but..."
3,How to draw the human head,"the book was good but a little to technical for my taste. I didn.t need to know the inner makings of the brain , veins and muscles of the head . There was no short cuts for a quick draw. It was informative but not suitable for what I was looking for."
1,The Divine Names and Titles,"I love to study Mr.Bullingers works, but of all of his books I have on my Kindle,Divine Names and Titles will not let me change the font size. the font size so small i cannot read this book."
1,so horrid it brought tears to my eyes.,"I am surprised at the other glowing reviews for this drink, for I found it to taste terrible and provide no extra energy.A bunch of us at work got a case of this as a joke. The reaction at the first sip was universal: ""This is BAD."" Half of them couldn't even finish theirs, it was that nasty tasting. The flavor is actually passable -- kind of like mixed apple and prune juice -- but the aftertaste is the true killer. Half way through mine I decided to chug the rest, just to get it over with. It brought tears to my eyes, it did -- and I have pictures to prove it.The worst part, though, was that none of us got any type of energy boost from it. I actually drank two more cans later -- mostly on dares. After three cans over an 8-hour work day, I was tired and actually went home and took a cat-nap for an hour.If you are looking for some sort of ""Fear Factor"" challenge or gag prank, then get some. Otherwise, avoid this one."
3,"Tastes good at first, then gets annoying... too pricey...","I ordered this on a whim, mainly because there was a $20 rebate for it, bringing the price down to $29.99.My initial taste reaction was that it was surprisingly very good. Carbonated... and, I can't really describe the rest of the taste, but I just liked it. I did feel as if I also felt better overall because of the B-vitamins.Over time, drinking two a day, a week or so into it, the taste started getting annoying, like I was getting tired of it. I stopped drinking it for a week or so, and the first can tasted fine again.As for the price, this is NOT worth $50 for 24 cans. It was, however, worth the $30 after rebate."
3,Steven's go juice,It is decent for what it is but you can find it at a national store named ***mart for a buck a can
3,You gotta be kidding me,The drink was some what refreshing and it did take care of that nasty bruse on the side of my face.
3,Goji berries rock!,"I enjoyed the novely of this drink, it doesn't have any caffine, so don't expect it to be a kick in the face like some other energy drinks out there. But its unique flavor and combination of vitamins makes this drink a winner in my book. I did not like the Cherry version much though, if you do get this get the Asian Experience."
1,FIXING A HOLE,"I recieved this CD as a gift from my Aunt. Next time I see her, I'm gonna jam it up her wazoo! God, is it awful!"
4,WORTH READING AGAIN,I really enjoyed the constant pace of the story - the intrigues that left you kind of hanging and the compassion of the characters. I will read most anything written about the Native Americans and love it when they triumph over their situations and those who try to put them in the wrong.There is something wild and free about their spirit that draws a person's feelings.Am getting so tired of these playboy characters with their loose [or no] morality -- where is their strength of character? Loved the way C. Burnes handled their tumble into temptation [grin] --The story kept you guessing with a lot of suspicious characters and I almost tagged the right person [before the end] but not in any stretch of the imagination did I realize the reason.To me that is a good read.
5,Brilliant stuff,"This single is amazing. I don't care for track 4 (Magnetic [Robert Liener Remix] ) but the rest are simply brilliant. This is some of the most inventive, creative and tantalizing trance I've ever heard. Samurai is extremely unique, well done, and catchy...the vox are awesome. The remix is awesome, although it has only one sound in common with its original...to me, it's like a whole new song; instead of the usual clap/snare they use a kind of water-like bubble sound. It's stuff like this that makes them so unique. Feel The Universe (Kox Box Remix) is more like psychedelic trance; it has a racy, choppy feel, and a great pulse. There are lots of fx and a great, haunting, guitar like melody with a very low action. Labyrinth blows my mind every time I hear it. It's beautiful, enchanting and creative. Despite the dead track, this still deserves 5 stars!"
5,Awesome!,"This show is spectacular, highly recommended. The dvds are great because they show all the stuff that cant be shown on American TV. Not a lot of bonus features, but the outtakes and deleted scenes are worth it!"
5,addictive,"love this series! as soon as im done watching, i can restart it up right after. the music is also an awesome bonus. sid and cassie steal my heart everytime!"
3,"""scandalous"" British teen drama makes Gossip Girl seem tame","Goofily over the top, this British drama makes Gossip Girl look staid in comparison thanks to hyperactive plot twists that even daytime soaps might blush at. It's saved somewhat by a very appealing cast, led by Nicholas Hoult as Tony, a cad turned vegetable (bus accident, don't you know), Hannah Murray as the nutter Cassie, and Dev Patel of Slumdog Millionaire as the cool, tired of tradition Muslim teenager Anwar. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
5,Deeply spiritual,This is a fascinating story of one woman's remarkable recovery from alcoholism; but even more this book is the record of a deeply spiritual journey. I came to a new understanding of acceptance through Marcia's insights. I have a new found trust in the wisdom and unfolding of the divine plan. And I now have simple methods to access that higher power and expand my experience and trust in the process. I highly recommend it for anyone in recovery or on a spiritual journey. (And isn't that all of us?)
2,Self-help pseudoscience,"If you have a behavioral science background or a modestly scientific mind this book will drive you slowly crazy before you abandon it as self-help garbage written by a shameless charlatan. If on the other hand, you are in sales, looking for self-help and have never been exposed to any social psyc this book may be an interesting read.I bought it after seeing it suggested as related toCialdini's Influence: Science and Practice, which is an excellent book that I read and thoroughly enjoyed. Influence cites much of the same research as Cialdini but does so less rigorously. It covers many of the same topics as Cialdini but does so implicitly and sloppily. So really what this review boils down to is if you have the stomach for something approaching science do yourself a favor and just read Cialdini instead."
5,ON POINT! Well Worth it.....,"Great book, it gets going quick and is a fun read. It remindes me of when I was in school for video production, the instructor told us all your never going to watch movies the same again. It's true If I see bad lighting or an intresting camera angle it takes me out of the movie and thinking more ""behind the sceans"". Now conversations are the same, I practice on everyone with out them knowing and it's real! Humans,,,,ha! such trainable creatures."
1,Kevin Hogan is full of hot air,"I was very dissapointed with every Kevin Hogan book I have ever read.He has catchy titles, and understands the psychology to convince someone to pay for his ""crap"" but at the end you still get ""crap"" no matter what shape or form it's in. I threw my books away and didn't finish any of his writings. Very dissapointed."
2,Is not the best,"If you loooking for the best book on Psicology of Influence buy Robert B. Cialdini ""Influence: the Psychology of Persuasion"" this is the bible of this topic."
3,So much information but hard to put into practice,"Excellent ideas. Lots of material to use. But ultimately hard to use. In this way, the book is too theoretical. It would have been nice to see all of the ideas along with a practical example in a real-life sales situation. Kevin Hogan did this with some of the points but not all. I would have preferred fewer ideas but with each drawn out more and perhaps a few of the same sales situations showcased with the different ideas and tactics. This way, the learning is apparent and the reader isn't left to wonder ""how do I apply this exactly""...As it is, I retained very little. The plethora of ideas does make me want to pull the book off my reference shelf...if only I can remember where to look for what I thought was interesting."
3,"Slow read, mostly common sense",Some of the stories are interesting but I'm finding it a slow read mostly due to lack of holding my attention.
3,"Great information, but not helpful for what I wanted","I think this book has great information, especially if you are in sales. I bought it to help me with an organization I am involved with that consists of a bunch of members stuck in a rut. I picked up a few good tips, but not as much as I had hoped."
5,One Outstanding Book,"A ""must"" read for anyone looking for anything in this area. Very informative for the price. You won't regret the purchase."
5,Great school bus!,My daughter (2.5 years old) adores this bus! She loves taking the little people for rides in it and the fact that she can open it makes it even more fun. It does come with little seats for some of the people but those don't get used a lot. She enjoys putting things inside of things so this bus fits her way of playing really well.It is a very well made product too. She has dropped it several times and everything is in tact so far. Money well spent.
3,London Shopping Companion,"This book was a bit disappointing. I have a Paris shopping book that is terrific, and thought that this one would be as good. Really was no help on a recent trip to London."
5,Good intro to techno,"This album is a great introduction to a range of techno-style music. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like it's being produced anymore, but you can still buy the entire album in MP3 format at EMusic.com."
3,Pretty good but not mind boggling.,"I brought Power in Numbers first, and was absolutely in love with it, I purchased this one and it was alright.Te End.Buy it if you have nuttin better to listen to...."
1,I just can't stand this album,"Many people have reccomended this CD to me, so I decided to check it out. I listened to the first few track in their entirety, and soon found myself skipping the second half of songs. I must admit that ""Great Expectations"" and ""Lausd"" are great songs, but I don't like the other 13 whatsoever. If you like Jurrassic 5, then you might like the album. But if you like the underground rap (where Jurrassic 5 originated) you will easily despise this album."
3,Happy hip-hop horsecrap...,"I applaud these young lads for bringing positivity to rap, but their bland lyrics and indifferent production values make this a forgettable album. This album is as momentous and as memorable as a trip to the bathroom. To be fully honest, it's been serving as a lovely coaster for my new coffee table."
1,No quality,"I heard good reviews about this album so i decided to go to the local record store and pick it up. I bought it used for about 7 dollars and i thought ""wow, what a great deal"". So i went home and popped it into my cd player expected great music, how wrong i was. J5 lacked vastly on lyrical inginuity and the beats were nothing to be excited about. I decided to give it another chance but it just wasnt me, ive stayed away from J5 ever since."
2,too old school,i think this album needs less then a 1 star if you like this then your stuck in the early 90's well if you are stuck there then you shuld get this album.
5,GREAT CD!,"This J5 album is really good, as good as the 1st. All the songs are really tight,especially Quality Control. This is definitely worth getting, no matter what type of music you enjoy listening to. J5 is the best hip hop group out, and they deserve a lot more recognition than they've recieved. Check this cd out!"
5,J-5 GIVIN' US ANOTHER QUALITY ALBUM,"The anticipated release of this album was well worth the wait. J-5's newest album contains a formula anticdote to open your mind to a creative and fun upbeat and funky mode! Cut-Chemist and Nu-Mark have included some dope obscure samples and Chali 2na, Akil, Marc 7, and Zaakir are hittin' the right lyrics to make this one another great album. The best tracks are Great Expectations, W.O.E. is me, Monkey Bars, and Improvise."
4,I've been waiting for this one,"I first heard some of the tracks from the internet a few months ago, and knew I had to get Quality Control when it hit the shelves. Cut Chemist and crew are responsible for some great hip-hop. Swing Set is a personal favorite, but at ~10 bucks, there is no good reason NOT to buy this album."
5,The Album That Saved Hip Hop,"In the tradition of Low End Theory, 3 Feet High and Rising, and I Wish My Brother George Was Here, Jurassic 5 brings about a new renessance in hip hop. With live samples and sparkling production backing concious itelligent MCing, J5 has raised the bar and given rise to the new left coast sound. Reminicent of the early 90's New York Native Tounge's positive rap, this album is an answer to the violent nonsensicle music that dominates the top 40 charts. You gotta have this one."
2,Not sure if its the correct item or not,"Well it came very quickly, but the picture and description on Amazon show this is the explicit version however, the one I got does not have that designation on the front. If its correct hey should update the product image."
3,"""Check that ego, come off it""","I love Jurassic Five, but something seems amiss. All of their songs tell us that they are far above gangster rap, and that their lyrics have meaning and are covered in spiritualism, yet these boasts leave no room for the actual lyrics they claim to have. The beats and hooks are phenomenal, but do we have to hear every other lyric how great J5 is. If you write lyrics with meaning then people will know you are great and they won't need to be told over and over again. Dilated People's has this problem too. Outkast keeps away from this and they do a nice job writing both music and lyrics that don't seem like ego trips.All in all, I still enjoy J5 and most hip-hop, but if it is to be a great art form the lyrics need to be more relevant.How many poems do you read that boast and brag about the poet?"
3,"Good at first, but easy to do better.","I bought this and ""Mind Over Matter"" by Zion I at the same time, and this is getting old, it wears out easy. Zion I is still bumpin' in my truck all the time, I love it! I would really recommend this CD. Another good one I got recently that I was recommended and will recommend it just the same is Ugly Duckling's EP ""Fresh Mode"". It's really cheap ... and only has 8 tracks, but there are some really nice songs on there. Just some other recommendations for ya'll. Peace"
3,"""...Its about...harmony...""","Its a good album. the production is nice, and the flow of the album gives the impression that all the details were patiently planned out. the lyrics are pretty insightful, and not lacking intelligence. Tuna Fish has one of the most amazing voices in hip hop today, and every other member of j5 compliments each other nicely."
3,Good...short of excellent,"J5 reminds me of a young Tribe Called Quest. They both put together awesome beats and pretty innovative sounds. The problem with both groups is that there rapping skills are just not quite up there with many other rappers. The combined harmony and simple lyrics are nice and all, but it just sounds to juvenile. While a few of the songs on the CD are really excellent, a lot of them are hampered by harmonious singing and too much record scratching. I would like to see what these guys do in their later years, when they have developed more of a complex rapping ability while keeping up the strong beats."
4,Totally fresh,"This CD is one all hip-hop fans should own. What really sets it apart from most rap artists is its style. Jurassic 5's songs just flow better than anything else out today. It also points to a new direction. Back to the old style of rap, unlike the gangsta rappers who run rampant in the world of hip-hop today."
4,Good stuff,"THIS is real hihop. From start to finnish u can just hear that these are a b unch of guys who just want to have fun. The band consists of two DJs: DJ Newmark and Cut CHemist, and 4 mcs: Chali Tuna, Akil, Marc 7, and Zaakir(Soup). I think my fav tracks are The Influence and Great Expectation, then others are Quality Control, Jurass Finish First, Monkey Bars, Improvise, Contribution, Woe is Me. The rest is good too. I think swing set shoulda been on a cut chemist project, bot J5. Maybe 2 mediocre songs, but still at the end im thirstin for more. And that's when u know someone is good."
3,OK Quality,"I was expecting more from these guys. I really enjoyed the EP, and while there are some great songs on here, notably ""Improvise,"" ""Swing Set,"" and ""The Influence,"" there is too much mediocre material on the album. However, Chali 2na delivers strong performances, and for the money, you really can't go wrong."
5,Big bad and bold b-boys abode,These catz have amazed me since Unified Rebelution. Now they have this semi-new album that is one of the best all around hiphop records. It hits with the jazzy fun yet concious music that any head can enjoy. Be shure to copp this album!And check a live show.
5,This is what quality is all about,"Truely inspired work, that should definently make some ripples on the rap charts. A true classic from an underground group. With four MC's and two DJ's, the album features gifted rappers and instrumental masterpieces. Chali 2na, Mark 7even, Zaakir, and Akil can flow and harmonize while having individual roles. DJ CutChemist is a genuis for his mixing. With an overall up-beat sound they defy most modern Hip-Hop, boring and repetitive. The West Coast group has a sense of responsibilty, writing great lyrics. It has an old-school feel, where the lyrics are more about battling on the mike and less concentrated on women, cash and recognition. It returns to the roots of rap, house music and political issues. I first heard the single ""Quality Control"" and I knew if the rest of the album was as good as the single I'd have to get it. I did and I was impressed, a great by for any underground fan or person who is tired of the same old stuff."
4,J-5,"To tell you the truth, I'm sick of a lot of mainstream rappers. When will they stop rhyming about women, cars, and the hood?If you're sick of that kind of stuff too, try listening to Jurassic 5.After the intro, ""The Influence"" starts playing. The second you hear that song, you know this album has to be good. After that song, this album does not let up. It has everything you could want in a hip hop album- positive, uplifting lyrics, great beats, sampling, and mixing. I would have to say that the standout MC is Chali 2NA, although everyone has their own unique sound.The reason I did not give this album 5 stars is because some songs on this album don't measure up to others, but that's ok. No album is perfect. Pick this up if you want a party album for the summer!"
4,pretty dope...,i havent been a long time fan of jurassic five but i heard about their cd so i picked it up...and i wasnt disappointed...the beats were catchy with that jazzy style and the lyrics were layed down nicely with some clever flowin...i recomend this cd to fans of tribe called quest or freestyle fellowship...
4,good enough....,"Well, I suppose after reading the one negative entry you're all a bit hesitant to buy. Don't be. Never take advice from a man who mentions the SAT in one sentence and uses words like ""lotter"" in another. It sound as if that reviewer is trying to be exactly what he claims to be against. He is exactly the type of music fan that feels the need to prove his own credibility via name dropping, when you see that in a review....STOP READING IMMEDIATELY!The CD is excellent, and if you do like groups like Tribe, Roots, and just good rhyming without the negativity, violence, and obsessive talk about the Cadillac's and tricked out cars, then you should like the CD. It's popular for a reason, it's good. If this is what matters to you, then buy it. If you're looking to be hip, and stay away from what's popular because it's not cool, then don't."
5,J5-QUALITY CONTROL,THIS IS THE BEST RAP CD I'VE EVER HEARD. THE BEATS AND RHYMES ARE EXCELLENT. J5'S BEST CD SO FAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Excellent,"Great beats, great lyrics, nice mix of songs. If you're more lyric conscious, try anything by Blackalicious as well. I love the beats of Jurassic 5 - Cut Chemist and Nu-Mark are two of my favorite DJs."
1,NOT what it appears to be.,"Good cross section of best hits on the first couple dvds, then the collection crash lands. The latter part of the collection (disc 5-12) is primarily glam metal ad nauseam. HUGE numbers of the REAL 80's hits are missing from this collection. Don't bother buying if you want most of the true classic 80's hits."
1,Dubs,Beware!This item is a set of illegal dubs. Hopefully the reason it is not available is because the artists being robbed of their royalties went after the scum that made this.
1,"""Knights"" Vintage 80's collection","When I purchased the used ""Vintage 80's"" 12 DVD set I was assured there were no skips. Unfortunately there were many skips. The seller said there were no scatches but I examined them as soon as they arrived in the mail(visually)there were many physical scratches on most of the discs. That doesn't always mean actual skipping will ocurr but it did, on almost all of the discs. My player plays every kind of disc available, including copied discs. By the time the order came in and by the time I had a chance to check over every disc(over 300 songs)I was over the ""30 day warranty period"". Now I'm stuck with over 100 dollars ""worth"" of discs where most of the discs will not play and the seller basically told me I'm stuck with them. Sorry, but I could never recommend purchasing from that seller again."
4,"It's ""only"" the Stones, and I LOVE IT!","The Stones' very strength is that they have always drawn from not-so-different motherlodes, Black R&B and White Country. And on this CD, some of Country's finest pay their respects to the Greatest Rock And Roll Band In The World. Personally, I'd MUCH rather hear a Stones cover as performed by a Country artist than by some of these bizarre little pansies hiding under the name ""alternative."" If you don't get the joke, tough. Go spray patchouli on yourself with a limp wrist and ""listen"" to Prince or something like that..."
3,great songs from the stones,"Great song titles, some songs (jumping jack flash, paint it black,& beast of burden) all done superb. the rest lack the rock intensity of the stones."
5,Great buy,"It took me sometime to get it running, but in the end it connected me to the internet and that is what matters most. A great price and a great addition to my wireless network as well. My computer is atleast 10yrs. old and if it worked on mine than I'm sure that it will work on yours if you just follow the directions step-by-step."
1,It worked well for a while and then stopped working.,"I bought this wireless card for the computer my boyfriend was building for me and it worked well for a bit, but then after a little over a year it started acting funny and then eventually just quit. The computer no longer finds wireless internet connections and I have to use a USB wireless card. I probably would not buy this again or recommend it."
1,Trash,"I ordered this device after some research. The website says that they have added new drivers that are compatible with windows vista. However, after installing the windows vista based drivers and setting up the proper configurations for the router and network, it refused to connect to the network at all. Hours were spent double checking all devices and access connections, but it would not connect. I ended up taking it out and installing the device onto a windows xp based computer as well with the same results. I don't know if it was just a funky wireless card or if the cards in general are just this tedious to setup. I will not be purchasing any product made by these people again."
4,"Heavy Is Goooooood, A great Prelude to Metamorphisis","Heavy get's you interested, makes you listen to the sometimes suttle differences in the music, tune, and you have to say, How did they think of doing this at that time? BUT !!! If you really wanna hear some work, you absolutely HAVE to check out Metamorphisis..... Put it on, close your eye's and just experience."
2,electric koolaid acid test any one?,"I've never seen a sadder sight then wasted talent, and if you're like must of us (meaning you're mind isnt competly fried from exsesive acid binges) you will find penty of that here.I was lucky enough to buy this record used after i heard in-a-gadda-da-vida on the radio, i figured it could'nt be that bad, my first mistake, my second was listening to it.At beginning of every song builds up you're expectations, like a rollercoaster, then the vocals come in, weeeeeeeeeeee, i mean eeeeeeeeeeek, this guy sounds like he's gargling rather then singing. it is both mentaly and physically imossable to make the full way through any of the songs.*note to any singer dont use vibrato unless you know what you're doing.I honesty would have given this album a worse had it not been for the real well composed and nicely synced backup band, and if you're up to the task of weeding through the crap, by all means, enjoy."
3,Heavy,"""Iron Butterfly Theme"" finshes up this CD, and it is indeed heavy. Heavy riff, with the guitar player making noises over top the whole thing. No, these aren't the greatest songs ever, but the feel gets you. It's electric, and definitely the early blossoming of Metal. It sounds nothing like any modern metal, but the blueprint is there.I don't think the band's line up sounds very different at all from the one that made ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"". There are a few tunes that remind you of mid-sixties proto punk (""Gentle as it May Seem""), but mainly it's all what you expect from Iron Butterfly-a mysterious vibe, and organ dominating in the mix a little too much sometimes, and slow/heavy rythms that prophesied Zeppelin and Sabbath. This is history, so if you want the history of metal, check it out."
5,Review Before This: One Star Is Pretty Harsh.....,"My only comment, after enjoying the criminally underappreciated (at least in the commercial American market) Kevin Eubanks' output thru TURNING POINT and SPIRIT TALK (the first one), is that slamming this second SPIRIT TALK album with a single star after some bitchy grousing about the young drummer's style is waaayyyy inappropriate, if not downright disrespectful. This album is just fine if you enjoy Kevin's TURNING POINT-era output, with excellent performances of modern jazz compositions by all musicians. I recommend this, and listen to it often in my office, in the company of GIANT STEPS, MIDNIGHT BLUE, and JACO. Five stars."
3,Gardener's Journal,"This is a beautiful book full of delightful illustrations. What's not to like about Mary Engelbreit? Although it would make a nice gift, I don't recommend it for a practical record-keeping tool. It was described as a ""functional workbook"" but is in fact, a hardcover bound book which is too nice to be taken outdoors into the garden. If you are looking for a nice keepsake record or gift for someone who loves Mary Engelbreit, then this is your book."
5,Perfect -,This journal was exactly what I was looking for. It's format makes it very easy to keep excellent records of planting and sprouting times as well as varieties planted. The month by month pages are great. As I say above - perfect!
4,gardener's journal,will put this nicely illustrated journal to use this spring. the only thing I would change would be to add more blank pages at the end of each section for more notes.
4,Gardener's JournalI,"I was disappointed with the purchase in one way. When the purchase was made, I was under the impression that the book was brand new. However, a sticker that was stuck to one of the pages made it obvious that the book was used."
2,Not for German 101,"Ok I can't fault the book with this completly but my professor chose to use this book to teach German 101. Although it is a college course and should be challenging,a single word of English in the book or cd would have been immensely helpful for me to learn the language. I have no idea what is going on, and I feel as if I am learning very slowly because I must stop and look up everything in a german to english dictionary.I would not recomend this book to someone unless they already had some knowledge of German. I mean even knowing a very basic amount could get you through this book. But if your like me and know only one or two things (in my case goodbye and please) this is not a book you should buy."
1,Hopeless,"After several years of frustration with spending hundreds of dollars a year on color cartridges when basically only printing in black and white, I've decided to just throw this thing away and purchase another product. According to Epson's on-line FAQs, the unit consumes a certain amount of color ink even when printing black only. However, I've had to replace WAY more color than B&W cartridges. I just spent 15 minutes on the phone with their techie, who told me we could change the printer-driver to black only. But I would have to buy ANOTHER Magenta cartridge to do that, because ""the printer will not function with an incomplete cartridge set"". I invited him to have a look at this amazon page if he thought my complaint was unique."
1,Worst printer ever! I have a hard time even giving it ONE star!,I've had this printer for a little less than a year. Did not like it from about week 2. It only faxes when it feels like it. Now it won't even print (I researched on the web and saw numerous people with the same problem). I says there is a paper jam-yet no paper stuck in it! The cover for copying falls off on a regular basis.The ink runs out constantly and is pricey!Epson customer service sucks!I will NEVER buy another Epson!
1,Gave it a one since I can't give it a zero.,Constantly needs new ink. Cartridge error is a constant banner. Will never buy an Epson again.
1,A major ink problem,"I recently purchased one of these to replace my 10-year-old HP printer. It has a nice scanner, but after printing 6 or 7 black and white pages, it showed it was almost out of the red and yellow ink, half empty on the blue ink and 1/3 of the black ink was gone.Epson's customer service said to reseat the ink cartridges so I did, but still have the problem. Other printer review sites mention this problem with this and other Epson models. I am still awaiting a response from Epson about what to do next. With all the complaints on the web about this issue, they definitely are familiar with it.My old HP would print hundreds of pages before I had to buy a new color or black ink cartridge. I'm glad I didn't throw it out. All the Epson is good for is scanning. I don't even feel like I can sell it to someone because I wouldn't want to pass this problem along to them.My advice: Do not buy this Epson model, and research well any other Epson you are thinking of buying."
1,worst piece of tech equipment i've ever had,"This printer has frustrated me more than almost anything else I can think of. While admittedly, it usually prints what I want printed, anything with color in has light bars/streaks across it. And, the WORST feature of this printer is that it flat out refuses to print anything if it gets the notion that any of the ink cartridges is low. And YOU GET NO ADVANCE WARNING.Aside from that, the scanner works very well. I have used it a lot and have been quite happy with it.Don't buy this.:)"
2,Never Again an Epson!,"I, like some others, received the Stylus CX7000F printer as a ""freebie"" when I bought my computer. It worked OK for awhile, but now there are constant problems and consuming mega amounts of ink. I'm finally giving up and getting something else. After I check the reviews though!!"
2,This printer is 'R2D2' with attitude,"I have used the CX7000F printer for a year and it has become increasingly neurotic. It often shakes, rattles and rolls for no apparent reason. It squirts more ink than a paranoid squid. And what's really funny is that I have to sneak up on it to put a single page in the feeder - say for printing on both sides - because unless done very, very carefully it senses the new page and total electronic armageddon ensues requiring a shut-down and restart.I used to consider this printer's many quirks as mildly amusing (my little 'R2D2' with attitude), but now its all become just plain annoying. Out it goes!"
1,DONT BUY THIS PRINTER EvER!,"I got Brand new INKs original Epson. Y replace all of them, Black and all the Color. CLeaned up the Header about 6 times cause it never worked and after that, i have to change AGAIN the blue color, and the rest are at 50%.I sent an Email to Epson Complaining about this situation. Lets see what do they answer.this Might be the last time in my life that i buy a Epson Product. My last hope is their Costumer Service, if they response in a good way, i could stay with them. By now, not even wraped as a gift."
2,Manufacturing Flaw?,"I've had this printer for almost two years now, and I've used it off and on since. Just today, however, it whined for me to replace the cyan cartridge even though I was trying to copy a black and white paper. After several attempts to to get around the persistent whinging by pressing ""Cancel"", ""Setup"", etc., I finally looked on Epson's website to see what was going on. Reading the FAQ for this printer revealed quite surprising information. Apparently, this printer *requires* you to replace a color cartridge (cyan in this case), even if you're trying to print in black and white only. Now, I don't care how much a replacement cartridge costs, I'm simply appalled that the printer becomes useless if *any* of the four cartridges run out of ink. True, the scanning capabilities are obviously unaffected, but I find if very inexcusable for Epson to have designed the printer with such a nasty flaw. If this is the typical Epson offering, I have no problem avoiding all of their products."
5,"Terrific value, works great!","Although some of the other reviews here might lead you to take a pass on this printer, it's a great value and third-party replacement ink cartridges are inexpensive. (See my COMMENTS regarding issues others reviewers have complained about.)Note: Before installing the supplied software from Epson within Windows XP Professional, I found it necessary to delete as many files as I could from my C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Local Settings\Temp folder (use your own username in this path, of course, instead of <username>). Otherwise, installation of the Epson Scan software hangs."
1,Ink Cartridge,I purchased my Epson CX7000F at a discount when a OfficeMax was closing. It a good thing becasue if i would have paid full price i would have really been angry to know how quickly the ink runs out. That is not the most frustrating part. That would be that you can't print in black ink only if any of the other cartridges are empty. Good thing i dont print much becasue i would have thrown this peice of junk in the trash already. I do not recommend purchasing this printer.
5,Mind-altering....,"let's face it, aside from these french cats, fellow countrymates deathspell omega, the almighty darkthrone and leviathan, the current black metal scene is pretty patheticthankfully there's bands like blut aus nord who still take their ideas seriously and see black metal as an art form and not a way of dressing like barbaric clowns and releasing angst onto antiquated recording equipmentthis album is simply brilliant, my favorite overall metal release of 2004; practically every element of black metal is altered and redefined into an all-new and fully captivating listening experience where the listener is sucked into the darkest and bleakest corners of their minds; an album that can both change your mood AND the way you think, as this can conjure some visceral introspection, exuding confusion, hate, sorrow and terror at any given moment of its durationdo yourself a favor, and buy buy buy"
3,"high flying,action packed,but no story",The begining showed promise of a plot but then it gave way to non-stop fighting but since there was no background given it was pointless.
4,Good Debut,"The Kitty Vermont is basically a younger version of The Magnetic Fields. This said, The Kitty Vermont has been able to pull off an entire parody album without damaging the form itself. The songs on Wonderful You are very pop/electronic and actually have decent structure to them. The lyrics are sad and delivered convincingly. The music and lyricism reminds me of OMD meets Cole Porter. Without relying on the basic Phat beat rhythms used by such bands as Sukpatch and Kitty Kraft, The Kitty Vermont have succesfully etched a place for themselves in the ""Wall of Sound"" electronica scene. I'm interested to hear what they do next..."
1,The Emperer's New Songwriter,"Dowd fooled a lot of poseurs with this album. Don't be one of them. This is unmitigated trash - unlistenable singing, EZ Big Note playing, and mostly lousy lyrics. The occasional brilliant line is mixed in with a bunch of third rate moon-june-spoon stuff, so that not a single piece rises above the trash heap that is this CD.Comparisons with Waits and Beefheart are disingenuous. This is puerile, steaming excrement.Avoid it."
4,DeLonghi ESAM3300 Magnifica is Terrifica,Bought the machine a few weeks ago. It is very easy to use and fairly intuitive. It makes great coffee and better than average esspresso. The only con really is that the water tank is not big enough...you have to refill it (depending on use) about every other day. Great machine for the money.
1,foolish,i order the product november 18 and received it december 16 after understanding how to use the machine i notice coffegrinds going in the wrong place i follow instruction to allign machine but still didnt solve problem call de longhi directly and follow instruction again but grinds are still all over the place after 2 and half week amazon.com try to contact seller but ad no response i just wish to send this piece of .... back were it belong...
1,Does not produce hot coffee,"Bought this through Costco (love the return policy), and I'm glad I picked that store. It will be going back today.The machine seems to be decent quality, grinds well, and look nice at least to me.It cannot create a hot cup of coffee though - major flaw! The manual suggests heating up your cup first or doing another preheat cycle on the infuser (it already does this each time you turn the machine on). The manual also suggests not using a thin cup, as thick cups draw off too much heat. Call me picky but it is ridiculous to have to pick a special cup (I like my thick Starbucks cup), and why would I want to have to have to heat up my cup each time before using it? It also does not produce adequate steam; it's really just a stream of hot water. So latte's are out.So hopefully this review will stop a few people from ordering, and save them the hassle of returning it.I will be trying a Gaggia next."
1,"defective, leak at the first day","i received this machine couple days ago, but it leaked right after i started the machine, piece of junk. Item arrived with no damage done to the box though. worse experience ever."
3,Returned due to quality concern,"When I first opened the machine from the box I immediately concern about the quality. It is amazingly ""plasticky,"" even the knobs. I didn't use the machine and requested a return label right away. Therefore I can't make a comment about the quality of the espresso. My concern that the machine would not last too long due to all the plastic components. I went for the Breville Barista with the grinder and I'm extremely satisfied with Breville espresso machine."
2,Cheap looking,"I almost bought this machine online but made a wise decision to see it first hand in a store. I couldn't have been more disappointed by its appearance. The machine looks nothing like its picture on closer inspection. The shiny stainless steel-looking parts in the photo are nothing more than plastic covered in cheap-looking chrome foil. The only real metal part outside is the drip tray cover. The buttons and knobs are wobbly. From the looks of it this is a cheaply-made machine and I just don't have the confidence that it's going to last beyond its short 1-yr warranty period.If you care about how a $800 gadget looks on your countertop, this is not one to own."
1,Horrible,Worst investment ever made. I'll never buy Delonghi products again. I was convinced to buy because of all the great reviews but it turns out Delonghi did most of them.
4,Long lasting,"I have a previous model and have had it for four years. It gets daily use and is terrific. Some people have complained about theirs breaking down. I have had to replace some parts in that time. They have been easy to find on the Internet, inexpensive and easy to replace. This is a terrific machine. While it is largely plastic, that doesn't seem to affect its durability. It produces terrific lattes and cappuccino. I can recommend this machine without reservation."
5,excellent product,I purchased the exact maching for three times the money a few years back and loved it. I lost it in a divorce; repurchased it again and got a perfect machine that replaced the machine I lost.
3,Product was dead on arrival,"Little red ""I'm having a problem"" light was lit up from the get-go.Even DeLonghi customer support couldn't clear the warning light and make the machine work.Got a replacement machine. It worked properly from the get-go, so am hoping for the best.Our previous DeLonghi Magnifica worked for over 5 years in an office environment, making thousands of drinks. Hope this one does as well."
2,Espresso/coffee flavor is bitter,We bought this unit to replace a Saeco automatic unit that unfortunately began leaking. After multiple adjustments and tweaks we are still not able to reproduce coffee comparable to our Saeco unit.
1,"System did not work out of box, customer service unresponsive","I bought this for my wife to use for xmas eve party. We opened it up and got to step one and the system did not pump water. I contacted customer service and they stated you needed to turn it off/on about ten times and it would be fine. We did as such with no success. They then sent us priming instructions (as these are not included with the manual) and it too did not work. Upon calling customer service yet again they stated that we need to take it to send it to a service technician and that we would have to search in the phonebook or online to find a technician to repair unit. I asked about the warranty and they said to make sure and save receipts so once it was fixed they could then discuss reimbursement.Horrible, horrible customer service, so if you want a new - non-working unit check ebay and we can help you out."
1,"Unreliable product, awful service","ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE. Owned one for five years. It started seeping so we replaced it. The new one ran for three months when it began to intermittently make coffee. It would start but quit before filling a cup and lighting the empty tank warning. Sent it back to service center. Came back after thee weeks, scuffed up, and not repaired. Sent it back a month ago or so. Waiting on parts now.I can understand a product failing under warranty but not being able to properly and promptly service it is inexcusable. This not a toss-able product where I can just skip out to Walmart and pick up a new one.I should have paid attention to the other reviews here. I relied on my past experience with the brand which was a very expensive mistake.Parts never arrived but FIVE STARS for Amazon intervening on my behalf and providing an acceptable resolution."
2,"Good machine, but poor build","I've had this machine for 7 years. When it works, it's fine. Coffee is much better than the horrible ""french roast"" of Starbucks.It broke down after 3 years, leak from the boiler, of course out of warranty.De Longhi tells you to go to one of their service centers.You have to ship it there ($50), have the boiler and who-knows-what replaced ($200) and have it shipped back ($80, with required insurance). Repair took 3 weeks and over 50% of the price of the new machine, but they did fix it.4 years later the same problem, leaks water all around, plus broken door latch.Called the center (sounds like some guy doing it in his garage), repair more expensive,so it's time to discard it.It is noisy, takes a while to warm up. If you drink the coffee right out of the machine, it's the right temperature, just barely."
1,Decent coffee but...,"Brand new machine. After the 2nd cup, tried the frothing wand. Steam started shooting from the side and back on the machine. Nothing from the wand.Was a very loud pop and the actual control knob for the frothing wand shot out from the front of the machine and leaked all over the counter...So each cup of coffee has so far cost around $400.Hopefully the amazon reseller will replace it instead of having to send it for repair after 2 cups."
5,Spectacular! Awesome Espresso.,"Not being the wealthy type who usually drop 7 bills on a countertop appliance I watched the prices on these for a couple of years before my wife actually puchased it for me. The machine does eveything it claims and well. Great espresso, I personally dont do cream or frothed milk in my coffee but the fuction is there and works well once you get the hang of making frothed milk. I would highly recomend Delongi."
2,perfect cup of espresso - until it died 2 months out of warranty.,"Loved this little machine - takes up less counter space than many others, easy to keep clean and made an absolutely perfect cup of espresso. Milk frother works well and it also of course dispenses hot water, though pretty slowly. Grinds the beans, tamps, pumps, out comes perfect brew at the touch of a button.However, mine decided to break down almost exactly 26 months after I received it - and of course the warranty is 2 years. I'm now trying to decide if it's worth the trouble to send it in and have it repaired, compared to buying a new one. If I get a new one it won't be a DeLonghi. This one started leaking water from inside the inner works into the drip tray instead of making coffee with it. This is my first fully automatic espresso machine, so maybe they all do this, but I think I'll go with a different brand on my next attempt."
5,"very nice machine, easy to use","I bought this for my ma's thanksgiving gift! she loves it and even learn now to use it within 10 mins! The coffee is so fresh, and has self-cleaning function everytime we use, save we lots of time on clean it."
3,Excellent for two weeks,The coffee maker was a Christmas present and the infuser got blocked up after a few weeks of using it. The repair required sending it to a dealer which was a pain but worked out free of charge. The coffee is excellent when it is working.
1,Regret buying it!,"Had this machine for three years. It was great while it lasted, but recently I had to get it serviced. DeLonghi does not stand behind their product. Don't mind spending $1000, but I expect it to last longer than three years. The company had no solution for me, their answer was sorry it's pass the 2 years, so you are out of luck. Will never buy anything from Delonghi again!!!!!"
4,De Longhi ESAM3300 Magnifica Super- Automatic Espresso/ Coffee Machine,"Luego de unas semanas de uso, la maquina se descompuso, se envio a arreglar y regreso en las mismas condiciones, por tal razon , NO recomiendo la compra de esta cafetera. Perdi mi dinero, pues no la puedo usar. Tampoco nos dieron razones o recomendaciones sobre que paso con la cafetera. Y eso luego de comunicarme por tel. a una compania que las repara a traves de una tienda. Que pena!!!!!"
1,"Machine may be ok, DeLonghi stinks, 12 cups later machine is off for 8 weeks of repair","Don't purchase any De Longhi product...Machine will not turn on after making 12 cups of coffee. Customer service is curt and not helpful.Only solution they had was to send machine from Florida ro California for repair. Between the transport time and ordering parts from italy ? ( no parts kept in the us, then don't sell it here ! )and then sending it back to Florida, my new machine will be gone between 6 to 12 weeks.It doesn't matter how good the coffee is that it makes if it doesn't work !I figure each of the 12 cups cost me about $ 66.00 so far !!STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT"
4,why can't anyone make a better steam nozzle?,"I had a Kitchenaid Pro Line espresso machine prior to my DeLonghi. I must say that I prefer this machine in every way.Pros:Fast warm upEasy to cleanPulls perfect shots every time (once you get it adjusted properly for your beans; you may need to adjust it slightly if you change beans, so the strength is what you prefer).Cons:The only real complaint I have is that this machine (like a lot of others) is lacking when it comes to the steamer nozzle. The steamer actually heats up pretty quickly, but it doesn't pull out far enough from the machine to comfortably get most cups under. I would give it 5 stars if the nozzle rotated out further from the machine and you could change the angle it sticks out at.On the whole, I think this is a great machine and would recommend it to others."
1,Broken after 2 years,This machine makes great tasting coffee but my machine has broken twice in two years. I'll never buy this brand again.
2,Saeco machine was better,"I bought this machine after our Saeco machine finally broke down after many years of use. I have not had the problems that some of the others have had from the machine breaking, as I do not use it as much as I did my Saeco. The reason being is that this machine lacks power, and is very, very slow. If you don't have a lot of time in the morning to make your morning latte, I would recommend looking elsewhere."
4,Great Machine,"This machine works very well. I have had it for about 2 months now without any problems. The only thing that I'm not overly thrilled with is the prep & clean up needed after each time you use the machine. Other than that it works very well. Oh, I also wish it had a larger water tank.Unfortunately, after about 3 mths of use with this machine it stopped frothing the milk very well. Yes, I cleaned it after every single use and it just stopped working as well as it did. Sadly I have returned the machine. I really miss my morning cappuccino's :(."
5,I love it!,"I did a lot of researching online before deciding on this model. From reading reviews, I have determined that the Delonghi line of superautomatics is the most reliable in this price range. Once I narrowed my search to Delonghi, the choice came down to features. Basically, display or no display, or automatic frothing were the differences between models. I ended up getting the most basic model and I think it was the right choice for me. Frothing is not that difficult and I have learned to use small espresso cups propped under the frothing pitcher so I don't have to hold it during frothing. The display, while nice, is not really needed since the 3300 has lights that indicate the various modes, errors and maintenance items.It is very easy to use. Just feed it water and coffee beans and clean out the waste coffee pucks and water that collects in the catch tray.The quality of the lattes is very good. The frothing isn't the best for latte art but thats fine with me."
2,Disappointing,"Did not work for us. Grinder was grinding too fine, hence the coffee was dripping instead of smoothly pouring down. As a result the coffee had no crema, and was not meeting expectations as advertised,"
2,Not happy,"Coffee is very blunt, no richness at all. Periodic shut-off probably saves some energy, but very slow start-up is annoying. Also, at power-up it spills some water from the nozzle - another annoyance. In addition, machine is quite noisy. I am returning it, and getting Saeco."
1,Coffee Expert,"The machine will make great coffee and espresso but beware, after the warranty the machine is guaranteed to break. The transmission went bad right after the warranty expired. There is no local store to go to to fix it (Washington DC) so we had to send it to NY. It was going to cost $500 to repair the machine.DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE OR FROM THIS COMPANY!"
3,it is nice but.....,"I wish the water tank would be bigger.It holds a good amount of beans, but I need to refill the water tank about every day, depending on how much milk I steam.Otherwise - love it. It was exactly what I wanted."
5,LOVE THIS MACHINE!!!,"I love this machine. I've had it over a month now and wouldn't go back to my old machine! It's pretty easy to use and will tell you if you need to do anything - add water, empty, etc. The machine seems to run through a lot of water but I noticed it keeps it much cleaner than others. The frother always runs water and steams the old left inside before starting another cycle!"
2,Keep on Looking,"I bought two of these machines (one from Starbucks...never ever buy anything from them and the other online), one for the office and one for home. They work very well for about six months and then started to have a plethora of problems. I called the manufacturer and they were NO help at all and then I found a place that fixes them and sent them both and 1200.00 later they still don't work. I had to go online and find parts and fix them myself and am in the process of finding new machines as the time and cost are ridiculous. DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY ON THIS MACHINE"
3,Espresso Machine,"makes very good coffee, easy to use. however it leaks water from day 1. Need to bring it for service already. not happy about that. Leak from inside. I am in Canada so they are not upholding the warranty. Would not buy it again on Amazon."
2,Delonghi has touble customer service,"This machine is great if it works, once you need this machine fixed you have to drive 2 hours to drop it off. I called Delonghi to complaint and to ask why there was no where local to have my machine fixed they could care less. I called and spoke to Delonghi Canada and spoke to the supervisor named Carl and she did not care about my concerns. DO NOT BUY A DELONGHI PRODUCTS!!!!!!"
1,Go see one first,"I drink a lot of coffee. Roast my own beans, etc. The idea of just pushing a button is very appealing. But... For the cost of a upper-mid range major appliance (washer, dryer, dishwasher, stove, etc.) I think I should be able to expect a device with at least some degree of quality. Not so this machine. It is, well, just cheaply made. Cheap plastic. Cheap controls. Cheap, cheap, cheap. Ok, I guess $800 in plastic junk is what the market will bear. $800 will buy a pretty decent stainless steel range, with a life expectancy of 10s of years. Lucky if you get a few years out of one of these coffee makers, and other reviews seem to highlight that fact. Many talk of how great their previous machine of a ""few years"" was and now they're onto buying another one...Go look at one first. Don't reward manufacturers that have neither shame, nor pride, in their work."
1,Really bad experience with the purchase,I tried getting this machine - the first one sent was broken. The two replacements sent were wrong machines. I have finally returned all three coffee machines and will rethink twice before buying from Amazon.
5,Great espresso machine,"Like most of you out there, I read the few mediocre reviews of this product and I hesitated... Don't. It is a wonderful coffee maker, churns out perfect coffee time after time. Easy to use, clean, quiet, works wonderfully. My only knocks are that the bean hopper isn't big enough nor is the water tank... But I make myself 3 double shots every morning with steamed milk... Go figure.Spend the money, it's worth it and you won't regret the purchase."
5,Service,For repairs try Heinz Boss and the Coffee Boss in Cornelius NC. He has kept my machine running great for 8 years!!
2,Reliability? Customer Service??,"We used this machine primarily for coffee. It's flexible for both doses of coffee and amount of water. You can also use ground coffee. That's where the positives end.The coffee was never very hot right out of the machine; had to use the microwave. The steam function quit after about six months. Back for service. After another few months the adjustable height coffee spigot wouldn't stay up any more. Finally, the pump went and just dribbled a bit of coffee out. Back for service again. It left here on Dec. 15, '09. It came back on Feb. 19, '10. I called about it in January and was told the service center was kind of busy.So, in the meanwhile, we got a Keurig. It makes a great cup of coffee and the coffee is hot! The DeLonghi goes into the basement awaiting a future tag sale. Real waste of money."
1,Will Never Buy DeLonghi Again,"Our $900 model stopped working during the warranty period. Unlike my experience with Nespresso, which overnights a replacement loaner machine while yours is in the shop, Delonghi sent a shipping box about two weeks after my call. TWO MONTHS after shipping my machine off I called DeLonghi. I was told that customer service did not have any information on my machine, and that someone would contact me within 24-48 hours.True to form, I never received a call back. When I called a week later I was told they were ""waiting on a part."" It has now been almost three months since I've had a working machine.A company that treats its customers like this shouldn't be rewarded with further business. I'm going back to Nespresso."
4,"Nice sheet, but note this is JUST the ftted sheet","The sheet fits nicely, looks nice. It is very durable. I haven't noticed any pilling after a few months. Just note, it is just the fitted sheet, while the picture for this item shows the entire set. A little mis-leading."
5,Softer than downy,These sheets are like a little piece of heaven. They are extremely soft and easy to wash and take care of.
4,It's About Time,"Here comes the sun. We have all been waiting for someone with the heart and talent to bring melody and harmony back into music. It is no secret from Motzart to the Beatles that the lasting value is the ability to interpret feelings through music. This will give you that tingle on the back of your neck that tells this is something special. It is not mainstream music and will not get airplay because Jeff Hanson does not have great cleavage. Jeff Hanson will grow however, because good music has a way-just like life. Get this and keep it close to you, it is just flat out good."
5,Inside Cys' space,I have followed the Fixx from the beginning. I have never been disappointed. I was pleasantly surprised with Cys' solo. His writings are intelligent and thought provoking. and I am never worried if a child of a Christian walks in. He is high class. He can say what he needs to say without being trashy. In the booklet it said that he recorded it one time. He never went back over the vocals! It has a unique sound. Not so much like the Fixx. Some of it is a little bluesy. ['I'm getting out'] I love it. It the kind of rock you would expect from Mr. Curnin. It is a must for Fixx collectors.
2,"Buyer beware, Amazon was incorrect saying this fit my vehicle","When I purchased this item I should have known better, there was no item picture. Days after ordering this item I checked back on the item page and there was an image.. an image of an item that was not compatible with my vehicle. Item looks fine but will not work with my Jeep. Waiting for 3 days for return instructions :("
5,A Winner!,"This album received a Grammy Award in 1961 for the best big band jazz recording of the year. The producers of the motion picture of the same title, commented when they heard Johnny Richard's arrangements: ""We had no idea. If only we'd known!"". It's that good and would have definitely fitted well into the youth-based story."
3,The slippery slope,"This album represents the beginning of Steve Miller's slippery slope into 80's synthesizer hell. It contains the right proportions of catchy ditties and good guitar licks, but only 5 songs! One of which is a 20-minute drum beat with laser and helicopter sounds (including a spoken (did Steve Miller invent Rap?(!)) introduction... Buy this if you have a morbid curiosity about such oddities, but stay away if you are looking for something you can put when friends are around."
2,"The ""Circle"" is Unfortunately Broken","""Circle of Love"" ended a run of successful albums for Steve Miller that started with ""The Joker"" and continued on with ""Fly Like an Eagle"" and ""Book of Dreams."" Unlike those previous efforts, it contains no hit singles. Not to mention the fact that at five songs and less than forty minutes running time, it's a pretty skimpy effort. The side long ""Macho City"" is Miller at his worst, endlessly self-indulgent with none of the charming songwriting hooks that made him a star.Overall, ""Circle of Love"" is one of Steve Miller's worst albums."
2,Huh?,"What the hell was he thinking here? This is the worst Steve Miller album, especially after the success of Book of Dreams. There is some redeming value such as Heart Like A Wheel, and Circle of Loves hypnotic qualities. I hate to say it as an avid Steve Miller fan, but overall this is ridiculous. However it does beat out Italian x-rays! The 2 songs mentioned are worth searching out just to complete your collection but generally speaking don't get excited."
3,3 stars for macho city only,This CD gets 3 stars for macho city only- the other tracs are retro fifties which is kind unfitting in this day 'n' age.Sayne
1,get Live USA 1978 instead,"If you want good music please skip this dreadful CD. Instead see if you can get the boot CD Live & Alive USA 1978 which has a SUPERIOR version of Heart like a wheel and a 10+ minute version of Fly like an eagle with all of the sound effects heard here on Macho City.Steve Miller Band - Live and Alive 1978 (Giants Stadium New Jersey concert)(German only release) 10 starsThis CD - 0 stars.Cheerio,"
4,Why work when I can write a review,"I don't have this yet, but I've used the 2005 version over the past year and I LOVE IT. Each week has hilarious jokes and insights on common procrastinator habits as well as helpful advice for finally getting things done (if not now, then eventually). The only reason I give it four stars is that I wish it was a little bigger - I have a lot to write for each day! Also, I wish each month began with a large 2-page view of the month as well as having a week-by-week breakdown. The Monday-Sunday format also took some getting used to, but it's been worth it! Procrastinators - don't put off buying this planner!"
4,spice 1 presents,featues spice 1 and b-legit.i have one 4 SALE for decent price as well as alot of other rare oop cds and tapes.EMAIL.
4,Stops dog diarrhea and dog likes taste,"My Yorkie is neurotic and gets diarrhea when she gets upset or nervous (storms, beeping noises, visitors). She will eat this off my finger or her plate, rather than me having to hold her down and squeeze it down her throat with a syringe like the Diarsanyl the vet gave us (though that also stops the diarrhea). The only thing I don't like is the cost for shipping it (about $8 shipping for a $13 tube); since it must be kept refrigerated it comes packed with ice so I understand the company's cost to ship is more. I can't buy in bulk since I only use about 1 tube every 6 months and I don't want to wind up with expired product I didn't use. But it works and I don't feel bad giving it to my dog so I pay it. My breeder, known for her show dogs, recommended this to me."
2,"great cover, middling album","yes, heavy and aggressive, pretty much a big ""F-U"" to whatever lout they've got in their sights, but it's an ""F-U"" from chicks you probably wouldn't worry too much about getting the kiss off from. They sound Leather Tuscadero tough, and, baby, that's not tough; it's just annoying. Jack Off Jill can shred a bit, and they at times fire up the guitars, find their hooks and almost . . . almost . . . reach something better, but Joan Jett was more fun and Courtney Love and Hole were not only more fun but much smarter than these gals. Instead of getting disappointed and pissed off at people and then writing songs about them, Jack Off Jill would be wise to just find a better class of friend. You've got to wonder, after awhile, why you keep picking losers. Attitude, ladies, can only carry you so far when you really don't stand for anything."
4,"Cool tunes, just like A.D.D. from Chicago",I really like the CD a lot......there's a band from here in Chicago called A.D.D. that are similar except that the singer doesn't sing punk-ish at all. Kicking tunes too !! Check them out at www.addarmy.com
1,no match,"this band to me is very dissapointing. they throw out some good music at times and then it's ruined when the singer joins in. i would consider jack off jill a metal band, but the singer sounds like a 10 year old little girl. she sings like a little girl, and screams like a little girl. her voice is MUCH too weak to match the music and it gets extremely annoying after one or two songs. i actually laughed the first time i heard this cd. i had seen a picture of the singer jessicka and thought i was in store for powerful vocals. then i play the cd and it sounds like a whiney 10 year old girl. the only recording i enjoy the singer of joj is on My Ruin's song Miss Anthope. I would reccomend getting My Ruin so you can hear a female with powerful vocals. if you like little girl sounding singers....buy this cd. if you want power, check out bands like My Ruin, Arch Enemy, Crisis, or Drain STH."
4,Listen to her scream,"This is a great cd, filled with angst, agression, anger, and sadness. The lead singer Jessicka can scream with the best of them. This is just a great raw cd.. If your looking for something extraordinary and unique that isnt really on the market, you should check out this cd. ALso check out her new band Scarling. THeir debut cd comes out in February"
5,Can't get enough,I am so glad I found this show and can't wait until more shows are filmed.I would recommend Hustle to anyone who enjoys plot twists and turns. It's fun to see Robert Vaughn back on a tv series since I was a big U.N.C.L.E. fan from the 1960's. This ensemble cast works very well together and needs to be recognized for their talents.
5,Wonderful doll,"This doll is wonderful! We bought one for both of our daughters for their first birthdays. It is their favorite doll, even after receiving countless others as gifts. Some baby dolls have weird faces, but this doll has a very sweet face. It also has a nice calming fragrance. It is soft and sturdy. The cotton material on the body of the doll does not pill like others do. Great first baby doll that will last many years!"
4,Lots of Musical Styles on this CD,"With all of the different music styles on this CD, it should please listeners of punk, rap, and rock music. If this was played at the X-Games, I'm sure people would get pumped. Buy this if you like high energy music with style."
2,"It's an interpretation, not a translation.","Like the title of the book says, it's an interpretation, which is simply a summary of someone's understanding of the book, not the book itself. If you've read a decent translation of the Art of War, this might be worth looking into in order to get someone else's opinion on such an old text, but if you haven't, get a translation first. This will only confuse you otherwise.The reason I changed my rating to two stars is because I think that Stephen should make a point in the beginning on the difference between an interpretation and a translation, so people really know what they're getting.If you are looking to get your hands on a translation of the Art of War, go for Lionel Giles translation. The two things that really make it great are the fact that it contains two sections(one with and one without commentary), and the translations themselves seem to be very well preserved."
2,"Very basic, no background of Sun Tzu.",The book is very easy to read but is missing some very important background information about Sun Tzu. This is not for the military book reader.
4,Great Experience,Products purchased was product delivered. Recieved in good time but would have appreciated a tracking number or if not available a date of shipment.
5,DOPE!!,"Anyone who wants a dope hip hop album, get this one. Its one of the best I have heard in forever. Ive been a fan of Rasco for a while and have been waitin for this LP to drop for forever so get this now!!"
4,I'm a fan of DK books,"They're simple. They're informative. They're cheap. If your child is too young to read, they're perfectly good read-aloud books.What more can you ask for when stocking your kid's library?This book is filled with stunning pictures of snakes being snakes - so if you're squeamish, avoid it. If you're not, though, you're sure to love the snakes eating rats :)One problem I *do* have with it is that not all the information is well-integrated into the text. There are too many little ""fact boxes"" on the pages. These just distract from the main text, and make the book harder for beginning readers. All information should have been written as a cohesive unit, not as a page with a separate little box of information."
3,Not for me,"I will take the other reviewers at their word that this book accurately depicts the male minds of the 1950's in the midwest. I just didn't grow to like either of the main characters, and found the completely one dimensional existence of all characters in the book eventually monotonous. It is definitely not literature, and I am at a loss to understand the glowing comments."
4,"Nostalgic, painful, hilarious, irreverent coming-of-age tale","For anyone who grew up in the 50's or 60's, this will be a nostalgic trip back. Two seemingly mismatched college grads, straight out of the Army from the Korean War, return to Indianapolis to start the next chapter of their lives. However, before as yet undecided careers get in the way, the search for young women who are willing to ""Go All The Way"" is priority for these hormone-overloaded guys. We've all been through the pleasurable, sometimes painful memories. A straight-forward, quick read, it shouldn't be taken too seriously...it would ruin the fun! The movie is coming out this fall"
5,Snorkel Hawaii The Big Island --New Edition,"The second edition of this book is great. There are so many snorkeling sites that this book will be a welcome companion for years. In fact, it has already made the Big Island a favorite.You won't find places like Frog Rock described anywhere else, so you will likely have this fabulous site to yourselves. One can snorkel a different site each day and find them just the way the book describes them. This book helped discover the Big Island in a very special way, and I fully recommend it."
3,"Good, but...","Good info, but some of the information is outdated. As one example, one hotel is marked as the Kona Hilton, but it has not been a Hilton property since about 1994. The book contains some very basic how-to snorkeling information as well as descriptions of access areas."
1,"This book is incomplete, inaccurate and superficial.","Only 40 of the book's 126 pages cover snorkeling sites, and the site reviews are usually half a page or less. Access information is sketchy and incomplete, which is too bad since the most important part of snorkeling the big island is knowing how to get to the sites, which are often poorly marked. One map shows the Mauna Lani Bay resort located adjacent to a famous bay and beach (Anaeho'omalu Bay), when it is actually miles to the north. Also, the authors continually refer to the Ritz Carlton Mauna Lani, when it has been called the Orchid at Mauna Lani for years. Only 22 sites are listed, although the jacket claims 26, which is still a superficial look at the many snorkeling sites. The rest of the ""book"" is basically a primer for snorkeling generally. This was purchased at the same time as ""Hawaii-The Big Island Revealed"", which might be the best guide/travel/scuba/snorkeling book available"
2,Snoekel Hawaii,"I was very disapointed to fine this book had no photo's, just blk/wht line drawings.Most of the sites reviewed are on the west/Kona side of the island, which is fine, if that is where you are going to be staying.Descriptions and directions seems a bit breif and I'm not sure how useful this book would have been.For almost the same price, ""Hawaii the Big Island Revealed"", covers many of the same snorkeling spots, and alot more, in much more detail."
4,editing can go too far,"Unfortunately the story of Lizzie Borden in this editon has been edited mercilessly, a fact my English proffessor only became aware of when she was teaching from a different editon--reccommend that one try to find collection in original form--Carter is too good to be edited so thoughtlessly."
4,"angela carter, where have you been hiding...","angela carter is one of my newly aquired favorite reads.her poetic insight and humor are matched by none. she is also a feminist, and has a macabre sense of direction in her stories. if you appreciate the fantastical and visually stimulating world of imagination, mixed with sexually-driven directness, try this book. very entertaining. smart but not smug. unique and creative in a world of repetitiveness...i also loved ""the infernal desire machines of dr. hoffman"" - a novel by carter which delighted me and made me sad to finish reading."
2,Cloying and Difficult to Get through,"I tried to like ""Burning Your Boats"" so very much, but these retellings of fairy tales with a feminist slant are too much to bear. They're often far too long, far too pretentious, and self-aware. Carter is no doubt very talented, but aside from a few stories in the beginning of the collection, I found the most interesting part of ""Burning Your Boats"" to be Salman Rushdie's fantastic introduction. 2/5"
4,Nostalgic Fun,"This book brings back memories of the early days of Famous Monsters of Filmland. Ackerman reminisces about the magazine at length. The reprints of ads from the magazine is particlurly nostalgic. My only disappointment is the the covers of the first fifty issues were not reproduced in color. Instead, the color section ofthe book focuses on his large memorabilia collection. A very good book that could have been great."
4,Hikers helper-separates the chaff from the wheat,"Details the flora and landscape of the hike; degree of difficulty of hike in a straight forward, useful manner. I have used the book for several day hikes in the Lake Tahoe and Bay Area and the book has helped make the hikes enjoyable and fun. Heed the degree of difficulty listing, they are accurate.BUY IT and ENJOY!!!!!!!!"
2,Cheap Looking,"I wanted sugar tongs, and these do the job. However, the picture of the shell head and embossed handle of the tongs is pretty on the website, but is so poorly pressed into the metal in reality that I have considered returning them. I also found shell sugar tongs at Crate and Barrel for $2.95, compared to $7 here. These tongs are not recommended."
2,Poorly Made,"I purchased these tongs for my young daughter to practice her fine motor skills (ala Montessori). I was excited to see the little shell shape as a nice accent, but when they arrived, they were squashed flat and bent out of shape. They are very flimsy, and so they were easy to set back into place (sort of), but you can tell that they are mass-produced and not much care is taken with their quality. Like the previous reviewer, I also recommend Crate and Barrel for a better product.It may sound picky, but, hey, they're sugar tongs, and people who buy them have an eye for detail. Otherwise, who would purchase them?"
3,Buy Volume I not II,This exition of Trancewerk Express fall far below the quality of Volume I. The album sounds more amateur-ish and les refined. If you have to choose between Volume I or Volume II... choose I
5,information,where are the products that zoom miami q told me I communicate with you to where they left the order
5,Smells great!,"The colognes were bigger than I expected and they smell amazing! My boyfriend wanted some good smelly stuff for Christmas, so I thought this was a good option because it gave variety."
5,Exotic and tempting scents,I bought Cuba Variety by Cuba for men to my husband. At first he tought it was cigars or chokolate but soon he found out what it really was. He was surprised of how good all four smells. The package is also unusual with 4 cigarshaped glassbottles.
3,"Ok, but scent is fleeting","Two of these smell pretty good. Fresh, fragrant, deep smells. But, after 15 minutes, the scent is nearly gone. The last two, one is very mild, and the last will give you a major headache. Still, I give three stars because at its price, you can always ask your wife/girlfriend to carry it in her purse so you can re-apply as needed."
4,Great Colonge,"I received it two days after I placed my order,well packed...The smell is very nice and the size is good...Smell lasts...For the price is a great purchase.4 stars because it's not perfect but excellent."
2,Problems with this product.,"Make your purchase from Venezuela through Liberty Express the product was placed in a recent international mailbox in Venezuela could receive one of the perfumes is Broken, sorry I can not rate this product, not where claim."
1,bad,this cologne smells like ass one really smells like bad BO. and the rest are just bad wouldnt recommend to anyone
1,do not work,two of the tubes do not spray. they all smell nice. just wish they all work. Gave as a gift last night.
2,Alright.,"These four colognes are very different. Cuba gold smells the best but, after 10 minutes you can't smell it. Cuba orange has a long Longevity time and smells ok but smells cheap. Cuba blue and red are not worth the money. Red smells like bug spray and Blue spells like powdery perfume in my opinion. Nice bottles though."
2,it looks very cheap and smell too strong,it looks very cheap and smell too strong.I sent it to a friend for a gift. it is too shame.
2,My fault...,"I purchased the product too quickly, I was trying to get last minute Christmas gifts and didn't fully read the description, so this is not a product I would have bought. Totally my fault, so I'm not complaining about the product. Actually, it smells good. If I had to complain it would be that once I received the product and realized it wasn't what I thought, I then wasn't allowed to return the product because it's a ""hazard"". Apparently, you can't send back liquid items because it could be dangerous.... Again, TOTALLY my fault, so I'm ok with only spending $15 for a gift I won't use. It's my punishment"
2,Just the Blue and the gold one,"I didn't like at all these fragrances, the one with the blue label and the one with the gold label were kind of decent, but the other two I didn't like at all, so if you haven't try these fragances you better try with something else."
3,Great Scents,So I got this for my husband and took the chance without knowing what they smell like. My husband and myself really like all of them except for the red one but 3 out of 4 isn't bad. I gave it 3 stars because we didn't like all the scents but the price and shipping were fabulous. I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend to others.
3,"Good, but I wanted more","This DVD shows both beginner and intermediate moves. However, I know that Fletcher has created more moves that are not included on the DVD. Unfortunately, this is the only DVD Fletcher sells. You can find most of the moves on YouTube. Other moves using the towel (non-Fletcher) can be found at sculptmoves.com or by searching the Internet for towel exercise workouts."
4,I REALLY ENJOED IT - IT'S A FUN BOOK,I liked the alot.I think is a really good book. Theres one thing I didn't like it was that it did n't had much exitment.
4,The House Without A Christmas Tree,"I read this book to my classes when I taught 4th grade in Nebraska. It was touching and heartwarming, we especially liked the school Christmas party. The characters were so well developed. Everyone related to Addie and her lonely life. I remember it being on TV with Jason Robards as the father. How can we get it back on TV?"
4,Cosmic Couriers - 'Other Places' (Cleopatra / Hypnotic),"I remember the very day this CD hit the stores. It was during Cleopatra Record's prime era. Tunes that (sort of) had me sit up and take notice were the seven-minute opener ""Culture In A Small Room"", ""Huhn Fisch Ente"" (English translation: Chicken Fish Duck), the near-brilliant ""Sumpfige Wasser"" ( meaning Muddy Water) and ""Other Places"". Personnel: Dieter Moebius (Kluster, Harmonia) - synthesizer & composer, Mani Neumeier (Guru Guru) - drums, percussion & co-producer and Jurgen Engler (Die Krupps) - guitar, synthesizer & co-producer. Only downside about this once-off project is that - say after maybe four spins, you'll likely end up storing this CD in your closet, basement, etc. - where ever you keep your CD's that you don't play very often. Oh, the music here is good and all, just that it gets older pretty fast. Recommended for fans of Space Explosion and later day Guru Guru."
2,"Poor writing, but a few good suggestions","This book is poorly written in my opinion, the chapters don't seem to flow into each other and the information covered is very basic. Chances are you already know almost everything contained if this book if you have a web site already or have browsed the web very much. If you are completely in the dark as to how the internet works, buy this book, otherwise save you money."
3,Weird stuff,"OK... I love electronica, and I like Jack Dangers, but this CD is not so great. There is NO MUSIC on it. That's right. No music. It's all freaky sound effects. It would make great background music for a halloween haunted house, but don't get this CD if you're expecting it to sound anything like Jack Dangers' other stuff. I gave it 3 stars because, even though it's not what I expected, I can still appreciate the talent that's behind it."
1,Don't waste your money . . .,"This is the most of disappointing albums I have ever bought. If you like listening to pointless lame music then, by all means knock yourself out. If you like Jacks work with turntables and big bass . . . look elsewhere. Seriously, don't get this album. Consider yourself warned! I was hoping for a great album but instead I got something that I can use as a coaster. Man this album sucks!"
1,this is poor,"don't bother with this - its rubbish and Nothing to do with the movie ""Forbidden Planet"". even the publisher's info is suspect: 'most experimental and influential group ever to hit the dance floor, Meat Beat Manifesto'! talk about misplaced hype!!! and the BBC Radiophonic Workshop worked right through the 50's to the 80's, not just the sixties"
5,One of my all time favorite albums,This was the first album I ever owned...I got it in the early 70's and I'm not tired of it yet. I think this is IB's finest album. This is their only album that I like every song.
4,Classic Rock Album,"The seller (Tom's Quality Music) shipped this to me in very secure packaging. It looked as described: used, in very good condition. To be honest, I have never heard the songs on this album. However, I loved Iron Butterfly's albums ""In A Gadda Da Vida"" and ""Metamorphosis,"" so I'm going to guess I'll like this stuff too."
1,Wrong Item,The wrong LP was inside the jacket when it arrived. I kept it intact before my father opened it on Christmas. His look of excitement was severely countered by our dismay to find it was not in fact the album I had ordered.
2,A FIVE-STAR CLASSIC NOW WITH TWO-STAR SOUND QUALITY!,"""BALL"" is the Butterfly's peak moment, and Collectors Choice has re-released it with enough tape hiss to actually ruin the listening experience. I'd mistakenly expected a remastering a la the ""In-a- gadda-da-vida"" reissue by Rhino, and this sure isn't it. In this day of so many careful and high-quality remastering jobs, this is a major disappointment. Thank God for the two extra songs. Otherwise, I'm sure the original Atlantic Records release sounds superior to this. In fact, other than the pops and crackles, my original 1968 vinyl copy has better sound!"
3,"Iron Butterfly ""Ball""","I also agree that Mr. Talsma is a bona fide know-nothing. To say that Iron Butterfly ""never broke true"" (did he mean ""never broke through""?)is a total joke. My God, ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" was one of the biggest-selling albums of all time, and although ""Ball"" didn't sell the numbers it's predecessor did, it clearly shows IB expanding their sound, growing and venturing into new musical ideas. The album has it's weaker moments, but there are killers too, like ""In The Time Of Our Lives"" and ""Soul Experience."" I saw and heard Butterfly play some of this album live at the Fillmore East in NYC and they did the material well. All in all, not my favorite Butterfly effort, but a very good one."
5,Adderleys OWN,"I love this CD, especially tracks 3 and 4 (which flow from one to another live). Track 4, ""That's called The Sticks, ladies and gentlemen, The Sticks, thank you."", has the coolest solo hand-off ever. The trumpet wraps his solo up with some double-tonguing that is truly amazing... until the saxophone picks up right there with even faster. Wow.I grew up listening to this album on vinyl."
5,"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy This Is Good Music!!!","Cannonball and his band bring the fun back into jazz. The jovial nature of the album reminds us that jazz started out as dance music, not music for sitting back and cooling out. One listen to this CD will convert a jazz athesist into a believer."
5,One of my best cds,"The title track ""Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,"" alone, is enough reason to buy this album. This recording captures the electricity of this particular show to the extent that the listener may at points truly get a feeling like they're sitting in the room with the band."
4,Almost as good as I remember,"I bought this becaue I used to have it on plastic when I was a teenager. It's good stuff, though not as magic now as it was then for me. I think it was the first jazz I ever listened to. But I do recommend it to anyone."
1,"If you like crown noise, this is your cd","As noted in the main review, this album is not live, but crowd like noise is provided by a group of pals who seem to have been encouraged to perform along with with musicians, all the way through the music. I bought the MP3 single ""Mercy Mercy Mercy"" in anticipation of getting the full CD but when the crowd never shut up, decided to forget it.If you are considering the album, I would suggest you try the MP3 of your favorite song and see if you are are happier than I am. Crowd noise is only good when you are also full of beer, and even then, only good the first time.This group not only yells and claps after every good bit, but they know the tunes and crank up the noise when a good bit is coming. In a real ""live"" club, they would tossed out or the start of many fights. They should have been tossed out of this CD."
2,Fairly good premise but mediocre execution.,"As both a dog lover and mystery addict, I expected to like this book a lot more than I did. Unfortunately, I found the characters (aside from the narrator) and the tale a little thin. For example, the only way Berenson can fit Travis' son into the plot is to mention that he's whining for junk food, which happens all too often. With tighter writing (or editing - I'm not sure who's at fault here) and a few less transparent characters, this book would be really engaging. As it stands, however, it's only decent."
1,Raoul Duke at the Pig Conference,"LMAO, this is the moron that spoke at the drug convention for the cops in Hunter S Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Needless to say he knows about as much about drugs as a Catholic priest knows about relations between a man and a woman. Yet that doesn't stop them from being experts in their fields."
1,Incomplete Episodes - Heavy Sigh,"Well, this is depressing. I liked this show, but hadn't thought of it in years. Something reminded me of it recently. I was momentarily excited to see that at least a couple of seasons were out on DVD, until I read the reviews. I'll second what others have already said - it makes no sense to release edited episodes on DVD. It's obvious that fans are not happy with this increasing practice. The cover clearly says ""The Complete First Season."" If the episodes are incomplete edited episodes, then this DVD set does not contain the complete first season. It's actually the incomplete first season. Could selling it as ""The Complete First Season"" be considered false advertising?"
1,EDITED EPISODES,"THIS BOX SET OF ""TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT"" DOES NOT INCLUDE THE FULL, ORIGINAL BROADCAST VERSIONS OF THE PROGRAM. IT HAS THE SYNDICATED/EDITED VERSION OF THE SHOW. YOU MIGHT AS WELL WAIT UNTIL THE SHOW AIRS ON CABLE. YOU WILL SEE THE SAME VERSION ON THESE DVD DISCS."
1,What a rip off!,"I posted a review earlier and amazon pulled it after a few days ...why are they doing that all of a sudden??! Anyway, what others report here is true. ALL the episodes are missing about 3 minutes worth of scenes and dialogue! Rhino is allegedly working to correct this so they can re-release the set, but for those of us who were already ripped off, this news is too little too late. I won't be buying any more Rhino DVD's until I know for certain that they are what Rhino claims they are. ...Complete season? HA!"
1,I will purchase this series when...,I will purchase this series when they release all of the episodes UNEDITED. I will also then change my star rating from 1 to 5.
1,"Hey, Hey, Ho, Ho, edited DVDs have to go","It will interest all concerned to know that at a specific website is an alterations list. I read about the fact that the First Season of Too Close for Comfort consisted of syndicated episodes, for which reason, I will neither purchase nor rent it. The studios who release DVDs of television program have COLOSSAL NERVE calling a set 'complete' when it is not really that complete AT ALL. The list of alterations is growing and leads me to question if releasing television programs on DVD is such a good idea anymore.THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE."
4,Any Cranberries fan needs this soundtrack.,"The song God Be With You by Dolores O'Riordan of The Cranberries is just amazing. If you are a fan of The Cranberries (and Dolores in particular), then you must have this soundtrack for your collection."
5,Everything you need to know about the licensing process,"""Take Your Great Idea to Market With a Solid Legal Agreement"" promises this new book. The promise is fulfilled with plenty of solid details about the licensing process. This is not about venturing or bringing your own invention to market, but about protecting your property rights while licensing the invention. This would include inventors who work for companies that may want to license their work."
3,Let me save you the trouble...,"If you are looking for a pronunciation dictionary that is current, lists variants, discusses variants that have equal numbers of adherents, makes suggestions for preferred pronunciations, gives data about what percentage of people prefer such and such a pronunciation, and is attractively printed, do not get this one. This is plainly packaged, has very little explanatory information (Longman's has over 200 charts and many explanatory notes), gives no data as to who prefers what or how many, gives little direction, etc. A dull affair all around. The Longman Pronunciation Dictionary is multicolored, informative, and fascinating to read. When there are dramatic variants, Longman explains the issues clearly. Longman also includes a removable phonetics chart so you do not need to keep flipping to the key in the front of the book. I am a speech therapist and I find myself going to Longman on a daily basis while the Oxford dictionary sits on the shelf."
5,Great fun toy!!!,"We have two of these, one for each of our girls. They race them in the driveway. We've had ours for over 2 years and they're still going strong. No problems at all with durability. The only issue was one of my girls left hers out in the sun and the red top faded. Still cute!! I highly recommend."
1,"do your homework, Greil!","Greil Marcus manages to make a sow's ear out of a silk purse. The subject matter is ideal fodder for an inflammatory book-to-be but he flubs it big-time. To those unfamiliar with the work of the surrealists, dadaists, futurists, situationists etc.. this may seem fascinating. To those of us more familiar with the genuine thing in its original form it's a shoddy hodge-podge of lazy research, self-aggrandising opinionated padding and (most damning)typical sensationalist journalism.Without going into details, Marcus takes terrible liberties with his subjects - by that I mean he tries to be daring and original and ends up sloppy and ridiculous.The best that can be said about this is that it will point people towards the genuine article. Save yourself some time and go to the genuine source material.Or read Stewart Home's ""Cranked Up Really High"" instead."
3,Just read it!,"Just read it! If you have any interest in Punk music, the Situationists, art, Chaos, just give it a read! It is the most interesting book that I have ever read!"
5,Great Workout!!!,This is a great high impact fun workout video. I would highly recommend if you enjoy cardio. I have already lost 16 pounds combining this dvd and eating healthy!
4,solid boot camp workout,"This is a great standby workout. I have owned this dvd for at least 7 years. I have moved on to more difficult/complicated workouts lately. However, I like to use this workout when I need an easy day. It is a fun workout with great cues! It is a great mix of alternating cardio w/weight bearing exercises. It is only 30 min long. When you need to squeeze in a workout, its ok. I consider myself an intermediate ""athlete"" ... this does not OVERLY challenge me to complete this workout, but I like to use it when I need an easier day. I typically use this workout with another 30 min video. I workout for approx an hour a day/5 days a wk."
3,"Good work out, silly theme.","The workout was decent but I found it hard to pay attention when she was making some of her comments. I thought it was a little silly hearing her say things like ""soldier."" I probably won't use this one again purely because the theme was just way to silly. I probably feel this way because I was in the army. Decent work out, silly them."
2,so-so,"I thought that this video was ok. The title is very misleading, I thought. I was expecting a challenging workout but found that this was too short to effectively do anything. It was fairly entertaining but I didn't feel like I got a good workout. The Method Cardio boot camp manages to give you more workout in each of it's 15 minute segments, so I'm not sure what makes this video feel so rushed. Also, there is little discussion about form. If you are doing the jumping lunges, and you do it incorrectly, you could really hurt your knees and end up not being able to exercise for a long while. I didn't mind it for something new to do, but I needed to do another tape right after to feel anything. I will use The Method Cardio Boot camp when I want this style of exercise-it's much more effective and you have the choice to do any of the 3 15 minute workouts or two of them or all of them. You get much more out of your money that way. I'd say pass on this one."
2,Instructor barks orders at the viewer...not for me!,"I bought this video due to the numerous positive reviews I read here on Amazon, and was very disappointed. I know the video is called ""boot camp"", but much to my chagrin, the video made exercise feel like work to me, and was not fun (just like real boot camp)! I didn't like the instructor's harsh style of barking orders at the viewer, not to mention the fact that there is not much emphasis on form. It may be a good workout, but the style of the video was such a deterrent for me that I will be sticking to my other videos instead."
4,"Good, but not for intermediate-advanced exercisers","Ok, lets just say I'm not a crazy workout fiend. I do like to feel a nice burn and pain the day after a workout, just so I know its working. This workout was good, I did it with 5 lb weights and I was kinda out of breath at the end of the workout, so I know it got me moving. I was so disappointed when I didn't feel the burn later that day or the next day. The push ups in the workout were awesome, and I still didn't hurt. So I guess this workout is best for beginners getting into shape kick butt workout, but I don't know how good its going to be for advanced exercisers."
3,Gets your blood pumping,This seemed to be a pretty fast paced workout to me. It gets your heart rate up and helps tone those muscles.
3,Good Arm Workout,"My arms are sore from doing this video yesterday. I use 5 lbs weights and did all the reps with the video. My glutes are sore too. Theres is not too much ab work on this dvd. I like the instructor. She is very clear with her instructions, but when she calls the audience ""soldiers"" it's a little annoying. Come on- I know this is a boot camp video, but I hardly see it as encouraging when someone calls the audience member by a military name when the target audience is not military people.Overall, I'd say this is a good workout for those interested in toning their arms and butt, but not for those who need special attention for their abs."
2,Not tough enough!,"Although I did work up a sweat and like the cardio aspect of the workout - which is what I was looking for, 30 minutes is just too little time. You would be better off jumping rope and doing lunges, push-ups and crunches. If you are looking for something that is 30 minutes and you are in fairly good shape - I would keep looking!"
2,Not really aerobics,"The instructor cues very well; no trouble following this workout. Unfortunately, I don't think it should be considered an aerobics workout. It was mainly floor work and arms/weights interleaved with some short aerobic-style sequences, but not enough aerobics to do the job -- get the heart rate up and keep it up. I guess ""boot camp"" is appropriate if you remember the old idea of boot camp being all pushups and situps ... but I was expecting an aerobics routine."
4,Not a bad workout for 30 min.,"I work out 45 min a day at the gym at work (either cardio classes or weights) and I wanted to do a little something on the weekend. I browsed Amazon and found this DVD which does cardio and weights. I find it to be a fairly effective work out if you're looking for some light cardio and weights on your off day. It definitely does get the heart pumping, and I even broke a slight sweat while doing the video. I find the weight portion to be effective also (I was using 8 and had to drop down to 5 for some of the shoulder excercises).I would definitely recommend this to someone who wants a short, effective work out on a light day."
4,Really fun!,"I bought this tape on the spur of the moment, and have never regretted the purchase. Advanced exercisers may find it a little monotonous, but it's a quick, thorough workout that makes you sweat. Sue Hitzman, the instructor, keeps up the energy and doesn't overdo it with the boot camp cliches. And she's right--there is nothing better than a good booty stretch! I don't own many videos, but this is definitely my favorite."
4,Boot Camp,I LOVE the Crunch videos. The only thing wrong with them is that they are only 30 mins long.
5,Love it!,"This is by far the best workout DVD I've ever done -- and I've tried a lot. I agree with all of the previous reviewers who have said that the instructor is incredibly easy to follow and so refreshingly unannoying!The best thing about this DVD is that as you keep doing it you can tell that you're getting stronger while losing weight. I couldn't do a single push-up when I started and now I can do 10! The arm and ab workouts are also great and I actually have fun when we get to the jumping jacks. If you were like me and didn't do much exercise it will take awhile to get used to this DVD but you get there fast and it only gets easier -- but not too easy, of course!"
4,Great workout in a short amount of time!,"The only negative thing I have to say about this video is the whole ""Boot Camp"" sounding off attitude that the instructor does. But it's minor compared to the seriously tough workout that you get in the end. From the moment, this tape starts, you don't stop. She takes you from strength work to cardio to balance segments to push-ups (then MORE push-ups later on!) and back again. I would definitely recommend this for time-pressed individuals that don't have an hour to workout. In 30 minutes, you are definitely sweating and the Bonus is that you're done in that amount of time."
5,Valuable insight to American Condition,"This was a truly penetrating inquiry into the origins and effects of anti-intellectualism in American history. The four major areas of the book focus on the roles of religion, politics, education, and pragmatism and the practical nature of American history. The book explores how these forces combine to make intellectuals, experts, and academics the enemy of the people in general, common sense, and folksy solutions. In a world with ever-increasing complexity of issues and connectivity of wicked problems with one another, this book is incredibly prescient and insightful."
4,anti-intellectualism in american life,"Anti-Intellectualism in American LifeI found this book shocking as to the lack of education in the late 1800's to 1930's. I also found it difficult to read due to small print & depth of subject. I had to read several paragraphs over. It was referenced on""The Today Show"" in connection with Susaan Jacobys ""The Age of American Unreason."" I decided to read the oldest book 1st & have not yet read Jacobys'"
3,Misunderstanding,"While well written and argued, ""Anti-intellectualism"" clearly displays Professor Hofstadter's admittedly leftist perspective. Throughout the New Deal era, and indeed into the mid-1970s, a technocratic, liberal elitism dominated American life. Spurious pronouncements by so-called experts (Galbraith, Keller, Bell, etc.) were lent authority simply through their authors' university affiliation. Later, as this redistributionist-Keynesian orthodoxy sputtered and collapsed, the public grew understandably critical. Anti-intellectualism? Of course not. People simply exchanged the notions of one scholarly clique for another (Friedman, et al.). That's the shortcoming of Hofstadter's thesis -- not all intellectuals are liberals."
4,A unique look at American history,"I read this in my first semester as a freshman in an University Honors Class, and had read nothing like prior. Other history books I read were simply names and dates, but this one is an analysis of those names and dates and points out a train of thought that has been prevalent throughout American History. A must read for anyone who ""thinks"" they know American history"
5,If Only the author were still alive!,"This book was very insightful, and it leaves me to wonder what kind of updated version Mr. Hofstadter might right if he could witness America now. I actually don't think he would be surprised."
4,Good but not comprehensive.,Like others in this series this book contains concise material on ENT with colorfull illustration and sometimes tables. not comprehensive but help you in your ENT rotation. well organized. printed on high quality paper.
3,DECENT EFFORT BY MODINE. HARD TO DEFINE GENRE OF THIS FILM.,"I found this title in the comedy section at the video store. It is more of a romantic drama with comedic elements. Modine excells at the sensitive smart-aleck role found in ""Gross Anatomy,"" a la ""Vision Quest."" He plays a cocky med student, with his own way of doing things, thus ruffling the feathers of the more conservative characters he meets. Along the way, he falls in love with Daphne Zuniga's character who don't immediately mesh. Film langours at parts where Modine and Dr. Woodruff argue. However, interplay between Modine and Zuniga is great. Worth a look."
3,skips - marks on dvd,"movie plays fine until you get towards the end, and it begins to skip through the end"
2,Heard it before ...,"It's not that this is bad in any way. It's two discs. One ambient trance music, the other more house-techno. I've just heard too much of this kind of music to consider this the genre's pinnacle.Maybe if your musical ears are relatively young, inexperienced and/or impressionable, this will be your thing. I really wanted to like this. Unfortunately, it's no Shpongle, Ordo Equilibrio, Psychic TV, Brian Eno or C9C."
5,Wild,"This book is a wild ride, getting in depth in the Manson murders. It will keep you awake at night."
4,The basics of team-based work,"This helpful guide from the Harvard Business Essentials Series will put you on the right track, whether you have just been assigned to a team or are considering forming a team to tackle a project. The writing is clear and concise, the advice is solid and the business principles are spot on. If you seek a guide about how to put a team together, get a project underway and manage it to fruition, you would be hard pressed to find better fundamental information in so few pages. We recommend this book to all aspiring team leaders, team members and managers."
1,Go for another,"Everytime I search a word within this dictionary: it hasn't been included! An example: the word ""aquarium""... There are others lack: no country names & no city names!Go for another dictionary with 50'000 entries, this one is around 15'000 (evaluation, since the number of entries is not advertised by the publisher, a good sign)....."
1,"Misleading, Glaring Omissions, Too Small","It's frustrating when you keep trying to look up words, and the dictionary simply doesn't have them. I looked up ""iie"" (""no"" in Japanese) to see if it had the Hiragana for it --it doesn't have it! It doesn't have the word for NO in the Japanese-English part of the dictionary!?! Honestly, if I were writing a dictionary, YES and NO would probably be the first words I would add.A popular anime series is Midori no Hibi. When I looked up Hibi, it says ""cracked, chipped"". So I should translate this as Green Chipped?! (the correct translation is Green Days). You could say, ""oh, this is a small dictionary for casual use"" and forgive the lack of words, except it's missing definitions for the words it DOES have, and doesn't have some of the most common words you are likely to hear."
2,ABQ BB user,"The picture is deceptive as it does not show the left side of the unit where there is a coiled cord that you must plug into the phone to charge/sync, making this not a true cradle. With the phone plugged into the coiled USB cord it pulls the phone to the left so it never sits quite right in the cradle."
3,Charge problem is just a driver issue,The problem with the insufficient charging power via USB is simply a driver issue. Upgrade the Mass Storage Device driver to properly recognize the BlackBerry and it will charge normally.
3,Excellent analysis of North Korea,"This book contains very solid analysis of North Korea's society and political structure. However, I believe that if the authors had relaxed their anti-North Korea stance a touch the book may have helped me understand North Korea a bit more. I wouldn't recommend this to be the first book you read about North Korea - it's a bit too dense and analytical for that. But it's a great resource for further study."
5,excellet!,"one of the best hair dryer i ever used!!is lightweight, dry my haior very fast and it doesnt get hot in surface.excellet product!!"
2,A Noble Effort Falls Short,"In The Laws of Eleanor, Trecia Greene attempts to portray two strong and stubborn women and to reflect on a third woman, the narrator. The idea is good, but the effort fails to really make the reader feel acquainted with or moved by any of the three women. Part of the problem is that the book is too short, too spare, and doesn't really develop the characters. It feels like an outline for a book rather than the full-bodied final product one yearns for."
5,An excellent book,It's kind of like a freaky friday book filled with magic tricks that Nancy must solve before it is too late.
4,Good stuff...,I won't get much into detail about scent and other irrelevant topics but one thing I will say is it certainly doesn't smell bad. It does a great job and Ive found it to be much more sudsy than the majority of other wash liquids I've tried. This is my new car wash fluid of choice!
3,"thorogh, needs a better index","A very thorough, college-level text that's set up mpre like a text in grammar than a reference book. It's not great for finding the answer for a specific grammar question-tough to find the right section and often too general. But with a good (at least second-year) knowledge of basic Russian and a high-quality dictionary (like Katzner's) it will answer most problems you come across."
1,"Maybe it'll work for you, maybe not","My vet told me this works ~25 - 50% of the time. Some dogs just don't care. If you want to try this, don't bother with the expensive marketing! The main ingrediant in Forbid is MSG - like in Accent food additive. By some MSG at the store and see if that works for you. (Note: I am not a vet, please check with you vet before trying any of this.)"
1,Didn't help,"I have tried cayenne powder, garlic powder, brewer's yeast, pineapple, and now Forbid, in the hopes that this would be the end of her poop eating. I've even tried all of the above together. Guess this pup is going to be one of the statistics that didn't stop this habit. Can't catch her fast enough. Ugh."
3,For-bid works mostly,"I have tried 3 other products and by far this one works better than the others. S.E.P. was a joke. The pills with the chili powder were candy to her. Neither even fazed my dog. So at least there is some success with For-bid to deter her until I can clean up. So I would agree with others that there is no perfect solution, for all dogs."
1,Didn't work for me either.,"This didn't work for me either. I found the best way to prevent my puppy from doing the unthinkable was to walk him often and get him crate trained. Thus, I didn't give him a chance to eat ****. He eventually stopped doing it and we were able to train him to eliminate inside on a tray."
2,didn't work on my dog,she woouldn't eat the dog food. she would eat the poop instead. Now she is out of the habit..since i changed her diet
1,Pineapple juice was cheaper and worked better,"I rescued a year old dog from my local humane society and discovered her stool-eating habit. I remembered seeing on tv that pineapple juice worked so I placed my order for Forbid and started using pineapple juice. Just a splash of pineapple juice in her food and the stool eating stopped within a couple days. I started using Forbid, and not only did she start eating stool again, she had horrible gas and diarrhea. What a waste of money, I can't believe I spent the money for this product when I paid $2 for a large can of pineapple juice that lasted longer and actually worked."
1,It doesn't work,"I have been feeding my 10 weeks old golden retriever with this thing followed by the instruction for 4 days, but my pup cannot stop eating her own poo. It should work within the first 2 days but clearly my dog didn't get the message. I would try a different brand because this thing won't stop my dog from being curious about her own poo."
1,Didn't work for me.,"Product makes a dusty mess out of the dog's dish and had no noticeable effect on dog's disgusting habit. Also, ingredients are MSG and wheat gluten, not what I remember from the description, but I could be wrong about this. The description did say that the product doesn't work for all dogs; I'm apparently one of the unlucky owners."
2,Just didnt work for me.....,"I used it on all three of my dogs. It didnt work on any of them. I am sure it is a great product, I have heard that it doesnt work for everyone. Obviously this is true. But hey... it was definately worth a try. I would suggest it to other people to try. It may work for them."
1,Did not work for MY dog!,"My dog's vet recommended this product and said it worked for his dogs. It did not work for mine and YES, I followed the directions. That said, it MAY work for your dog. The problem, as I see it, is the product is suppose to make poop taste bad. Say what? I thought poop naturally tastes bad. Is this a government cover up? Does poop actually taste good?"
4,It does deter...we just have a very committed poop eater,"This product is easy to use and doesn't have a bad smell when putting it in the dog's food. We have a 1 year old from a shelter, so he has many months of stool eating. This product is the only thing that has at least reduced that. We are using other training techniques as well to get our dog to stop. This is the only product we found, thanks to the recommendation of our vet, that has slowed our persistent pup down!"
2,Definitely not one of her better books,"I can always tell when I am reading one of Catherine Coulter's earlier works. I started reading her books with her later work and thought I'd enjoy her earlier stuff, too. Boy, was I wrong. Apparently, at this point in her life, Catherine Coulter was much too influenced by the genre common to so many of the 70's and 80's romances. She would have us believe that, after being raped repeatedly by Magnus, Zarabeth would feel anything tender for him? For 2/3's of the novel, Magnus treats Zarabeth with contempt and barely controlled rage and we are supposed to believe that this is conducive to inspiring love and faith in him? Not likely.Also, I know that Catherine Coulter's writing style today is much, much better, but I have to say that the dialogues in Season of the Sun were clipped and the character developement was horrible, with much left to the reader to fill in."
3,"It was OK, I guess....","I didn't think that it was such a terrible book, like many here stated but it is not one of the best. Personally, I would like the alpha male hero that's often dark and brutish. Rolfe in Brenda Joyce's ""Conqueror"" is an excellent example. However, Magnus didn't quite measure up. He tortures Zarabeth for the better part of the book for no good reason other that she refused to marry him after initially accepting his offer, and he is now pissed. Also, there were at least two (and possibly more) instances when ""...his fist connected with her jaw"". The woman likely had no teeth left by the end of this book. Was that the ONLY way he could shut her up? I didn't find that very appealing or romantic."
1,"rape, slavery, humiliation, abuse","This is supposed to be a romance? In whose world are rape, slavery, humiliation and other abuses romantic? This is disgusting. Someone mentioned they ""like the fact that they simply didn't just fall in bed together and live happily ever after"". Does this mean they liked the fact that he raped and humiliated her? Or was it her being whipped that was so much better? If I wanted to read about abuse and slavery I'll re-read ROOTS. At least it is well written. When I want to escape with a feel good, funny, romantic book I'll read a romance - just not one from this author."
2,Abusive romance,"'Magnus' was physically abusive with 'Zarabeth', even his eight year old son 'Egill' was physically abusive to little 'Lotti'. I know women were treated to rape, slavery, beatings, infidelity and other abuses, even killed at the whim of a man back then but I look for better from the hero of the book. I want some gentle, protective feelings from my hero. And the heroine, I would like to see more backbone and intelligence from her. 'Magnus' and 'Zarabeth' were both lacking of all the ingredients that make for a truly romantic and memorable romance. I liked Lotti the best. 'Lotti' had a bravery and sensitivity in her little body that 'Zarabeth' lacked."
3,I did not hate it!,"I have been really hesitant about reading any more Coulter books since the last were such disappointments, i.e. Nightingale Legacy and Midsummer Magic. The only reason I even bothered to pick this one up is that I actually enjoyed the Viking trilogy and wanted to read another Norse story. The storyline of Season of the Sun is engaging, and for once the hero is not a total bastard (even though the female is somewhat brainless). You really cannot expect too much from Coulter's historical romances in the way of witty dialogue; it usually goes something like this. Heroine, ""I don't like you."" Hero, ""I can beat you, you know."" For once, Coulter skips much of the dialogue and just has the characters run around and interact, this is an improvement! Although I am starting to rethink that third star, this book is good enough for thoughtless entertainment."
5,Excellent Reading,"This book was good. There was a lot of violence and the need to be the master as Magnus' character portrayed, but he warms and is able to see another side of Zarabeth. He finds that he does still love her. It's a nice story that makes one feel a lot of different emotions to all of the characters in the story, but it also captivates and describes well the time period and what it was like."
2,I expected better,"Having read other Catherine Coulter novels, I expected this to be along her usual level of excellence. I was wrong. In the introduction she states this isn't a rewrite of the novel, just putting it in different clothes -- she should have done some rewriting! The characterization leaves much to be desired, the hero or heroine don't inspire any empathy, the writing at times feels emotionless (her complete lack of emotional punctuation, such as exclamation points, is an excellent example) and the dialogue is clipped and underdeveloped. While the idea behind the story is good, the actual story itself is not up to Coulter's standards."
5,An Unknown Gem,"I can't believe I'm the first to review this. Geri's playing on this recording is on par with Chick's on Now He Sings, Now He Sobs. For power packed, mathematical arpeggios soaring over Ron and Tony's propulsion check out RTG, Drummers Song and Feed The Fire. I can only chalk up the pleasure of owning this to living in Boston and talking to the Berklee students in the now defunct Tower Records. If you love the jazz trio format this is a must have."
5,MWHAHAHAHA da Prowlers will get u..............,its a cool book wit lots of gore and i just bought da 2nd one so ya...... and da person Courtney is cool!!!cya
2,NOT No Rub,"While this is continuous spray, it is not No Rub as advertised. It comes out in splotches of white lotion that have to be rubbed in to be effective."
3,This book is a bit stale.,This book is difficult to read. Not because the concepts are difficult but it is written in a manner that makes it hard to stay focused. The first few chapters seem easy but by chapter 4 it was like pulling teeth to absorb the information.
5,Fast and great service!! book is perfect,Book was here 2 days after i ordered. 160 new in book store and i paid 11.99 after shipping was added! book was perfect condition
5,It's My Honor!,"It is more than my honor to be the very first reviewer to ever review this album on this website. The only thing that I can not believe is that I got this oportunity considering this album is after all dated back to 1996. As you can probably already tell I am definitely a fan of the quality of music that LCD ""Endor Fun"" has to offer. The tracks on here are of the highest calliber considering LCD is one of Sweden's top dance acts. They are said to be the answer to The Chemical Brothers which you will here throughout the album, esspecially in track #1. As they say in the dance industry the cover says it all. So buy it and you will see,.............3-D LCD!"
3,Redundant beats with some gems,"Mixed bad. That's pretty much all there is to say about this CD. There are a fair amount of tracks that have a nice groove to them, but that's it. The song doesn't go anywhere. Now there are a few songs that still fall into this category, but have a nice enough hook to it that you don't mind hearing it over and over.ILLUMINATOR and SUPRIME WIERDNESS fall into that category of catchy grooveness and make it worth having the CD. ENDORFUN also pretty close to being there as well. Track 4 I believe is called Mad Love (at least according to having the same track with vocals from a compilation CD I own) and just barely makes it. If you ask me get the New Dark Noise album to hear a slightly better version, even if it's darkwave.Considering the used prices for this CD I would say go for it if you are an EDM (Electronic Dance Music) fan. Make sure and get one with the original case. There is a really neat 3D shifting effect on the album cover."
1,difficult,"the Sut Lovingood dialect was so dificult to plow thru, sentence by sentence, that i gave up. perhaps when i have more (lots more) time, i can sit down and absorb it. even at 68, i have adjusted to want my info fast, and my entertainment fast. what a shame."
5,"Fast, accurate service!",Got exactly what I wanted at a great price in a timely manner. I'll be ordering again from this company very soon!
4,physical chemistry,"I'm currently struggling through the quantum mechanics portion of a physical chemistry course. ""Orbitals in Chemistry"" is invaluable in explaining the concepts behind the complex derivations and cryptic explanations found in Levine's ""Physical Chemistry"". Nothing can make physical chemistry easy. This book included. But it is a book definitely written for students."
2,Steam plate,"Product did not arrive, even after vendor tried sending a second one. Full refund was given, so giving the vendor appreciation. Wish the product had come."
4,"What I expected, good quality","The uniform seems to be exactly what I needed. I have however, not trained yet as my training does not begin before the 1st of September. The quality looks good and the style was exactly what I needed."
1,Schleich tent disappointing,Terrible toy. One of the worst I've ordered. It doesn't stay together at all. Very flimsy. It has turned me off Schleich products entirely.
4,Fun Easy Toy,My 4 year enjoys this toy. Its simple enough for him to put together and its easy to take a part and store. We also have the Papo and Le Van Toys and this goes well with our other castle and toys.
4,Good Product,"The product is very good.1. Hypoallergenic: Great for people with allergies.2. Doesn't burn after shaving: Something lots of people look for in deodorants.3. For the most part Odor-Free4. It's a clear gel, so it won't leave white marks on clothing or on you.The only bad thing i have to complain about is that the gel takes a little bit to dry. But i still recommend it."
2,Not dry enough,"Not only did this deodorant not help with the skin problems I have, it also did not do it's job effectively. It was much too wet. I felt like I was wetter in my underarms than I would be without any deodorant. Not impressed."
2,No Big Deal,"I was tired of natural deodorants that just didn't work for B.O. However this isn't that much better on odor. It stops you from sweating which I did not care about. It also makes me sneeze and is hard to wash off the next day in the shower. While it goes on clear and dries smooth, my armpits feel sticky or coated in the shower the next day. I would not get it again."
2,It's okay if I'm sitting inside all day.,"I developed an allergy to my usual high strength deoderant so I tried Almay's Hypoallergenic version (since my eye doctor recommended the brand for makeup if i insisted on wearing it). The first day I used it, I was at an outdoors festival where I was running a booth. I was sweating more than I ever had since I started wearing antipersperiant because the product didn't do a thing for me. Even under average weather conditions (75 degress F) the product seems to start to weaken after an hour or two. Also, the scent mixes with my natural body odor (which is not offensive unless I've been working out hardcore) and creates a bizarre smell. The price is good, even if you want to give it a try it's not a bank breaker. I wouldn't use it on a day you have a date or a job interview if you're going for a test run."
5,Favorite Anti-Perspirant,This is my favorite anti-perspirant. I buy it in bulk on Amazon. The price is great and the product works!! I love Almay products and this one lives up to the Almay name!
5,"Please never stop making this, Almay!","Just like a previous reviewer, I developed a reaction to every other deodorant I tried. I tried one ""natural"" deodorant, which was laughably ineffective (but didn't cause a rash). My dermatologist told me about Almay. I love that it's a clear gel and rarely ever leaves a mark on anything. It doesn't feel slimy like some other gels I've tried (Secret). It works well, but during strenuous exercise I feel like I could use a little more ""deodorizing"". I just hope they never stop making it because I don't know what I'll do!"
2,"No irritation, no scent, but doesn't work...","I have been searching for a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic deodorant, and thought this was perfect. Until I tried it. It doesn't irritate my skin, it has only the scent of aloe (which is as close to fragrance-free as you can get), but it just doesn't work for me. Thankfully, it's cheap enough that I don't feel like the money was a complete waste, but I won't buy it again."
3,"Well produced collection, needs more musical ideas.","I couldn't help thinking of Yanni's orchestral music until the second half of this CD. Think of beautiful, heaped up, colorful frosting on top of vanilla cake - much ado over a small idea. However, it seemed to get better later in the CD. More ideas appeared. Viana's violin did not so overpower. Less soundtrack (i.e. background) music. Recommended starter for South American prog."
4,Very much needed,In today's world fuel pressure is very critical. I had the ability to borrow this product and test it before I had to purchase it. This is a great product and is sold at a great price here on Amazon. With a fleet of over 400 vehicles it is also a money saver. We can now test and not have to guest.
4,It really works -- but only if you take the time!,"Egoscue says that most chronic pain is caused by poor posture and poor body mechanics (e.g., moving wrong). The solution -- a set of stretches that teach you good posture and good body mechanics. These ""E-cises"" are gentle and easy to perform. They do take a bit of time -- more than an hour for people who use PCs all day -- but the results are amazing. The biggest problem with this book can only addressed by the reader: this advice does you no good unless you lay down and do the E-cises. Don't let the lengthy time daunt you though -- the time required shrinks after a few weeks, and the relief is well worth it. The 5-minute stretches are helpful, too. The reviewers who didn't like this book all sound like they never actually tried the E-cises.I'd give this book 5-stars, but I must in honesty admit that Egoscue's book ""Pain Free"" is superior."
3,Good but completely ommits the hands,"When all you have is hammer everything starts looking like a nail. That's how this book approaches the healing and fixing the pain in your hands. Author has good tips on how to stretch and help with back, neck and shoulder pain but for hands he has nothing. Instead he says your problem is not with hands rather with shoulders or hips, since that is all he knows about. Really?For hand pain this book will not help since it does not address it or even acknowledge it as something that needs to be addressed. I recommend""The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guide for Pain Relief"" and ""End Your Carpal Tunnel Pain Without Surgery""Depending on level of your injury though neither of these might really provide pain free PC experience although they will help."
5,Super Fast,"The book arrived super fast. It shipped within hours of my payment being accepted. And a few days later, it was in my mailbox. I couldn't ask for anything more."
5,My friend loves this,I ordered this book for a friend after she told me about the prior Pain Free book by the same author. She has enjoyed it and says it's very helpful.
5,"Sturdy construction, easy to assemble and use",The product arrived on time and in good condition. The assembly instructions were clear and there were no missing parts. It was easy to assemble with a few common hand tools. It is easy to adjust for persons of different heights. It is well-constructed and easy to use. Very solid product. Would recommend.
2,not serenity,"The write up I read sounded very encouraging. In reality, it is confusing because I am directed back and forth from one end of the book to another. For example, Step 1 has an intoduction, then I am directed to page 13 of part 2, then to page 217, followed by 380, 401, 410, 417, 439, then p29 of first sectin, etc. I would prefer the book go consecutively. I expected it to be more like a daily devotional."
5,"Not like ""in your face,"" cheesy, American cartoons","This is why I love Charlie and Lola. Out of the first three DVD's I've watched, this one is my favorite. Definitely worth the money. I think very highly of any cartoon that doesn't portray a bad guy or extremely bad situation and yet is far more entertaining than what is commonly seen on our American TV. It's the every day stuff that brings out the creativity in kids. Nothing spectacular happens in Charlie and Lola and that's what is so endearing about it."
2,Needs Updating,"I love the spirit of this book, but it was written in 2003, and so far every hike I've tried has had sections closed, (most notably a bridge, which is a major issue,) as well as the inevitable landmark changes that come with time, making the hikes difficult to undertake. Also, the narrative style of this series is impossible to follow if you are actually hiking. You can't very well head down the trail with your nose in the book, or you risk missing the very wonders the author is so aptly describing. I find myself wanting more detailed maps, and perhaps some pictures of the nature being described. That being said, the book works very well for discovering some great parks. I just don't worry about following the suggested hike, or frustration is the inevitable outcome. A new update is definitely in order!"
4,Excellent CD,"This Cd is very good, Graeham Goble one of the originals of the Little River Band wrote the music for this and had a very good female singer and others harmonize together like the little river Band did. If you want to get it cheaper, go to graeham Goble's official site, he is selling it for much cheaper, plus there is other music that is really good."
3,Inspirational to say the least...,"""Hip-Hop Laws of Success"" is worth the buy. It simply showcases the small things to meditate on for success in hip-hop. I wouldn't say they are laws though!! I would definitely recommend the dvd to anyone seeking inspiration into the hip-hop business world."
4,Excellent book for educators!,I can't wait for the new school year to begin! I think I will be able to really help those students on IEP's.
4,Good for an introduction to Multiple Intelligences,This book is a good intro to Multiple Intelligences and provdes very good examples of 'real life' applications of multiple intelligence lessons in the classroom.
2,UGH!,I needed to buy this book for my graduate level class. I thought that everything that I read was information that I already knew. I guess that this book would benefit a beginner in MI but it was very dry and boring.
4,Multiple Intelligences can be APPLIED,"I have been fascinated with the idea of multiple intelligences since I first learned of Howard Gardner's theory. Thomas Armstrong provides a review of the basics of that theory, but then takes it a step further. Armstrong provides countless examples of how each intelligence can be used in the classroom as well as how those intelligences can be assessed. Armstrong also provides ideas on what to include in a M.I. portfolio and how to assess each student's learning through their unique intellectual proclivities. Finally, Armstrong shows us how the traditional paradigm of special education can change and benefit from the application of M.I. theory. This book is well organized, an easy read, and one meant to be read again and again."
5,Super applications!,"As a teacher, I have read much on the theroy of M.I. Here Armstrong takes the next step by offering specific applications of this theory. I have loaned my book to others and I'm sure I will re-read it again myself. - JVM High School Physics Teacher"
3,Red RC Transmitter Ribbon,What can I say it's just a red strip of vinyl ribbon I tied on my RC transmitter to help determine wind direction.It works.BIGEMANN!!
4,Deeper into the poison....,"In Cantarella 2 we go deeper into the dark world of the Italian Renaissance and Cesare Borgia as retold in manga fashion. The background scenes are remarkably authentic, the costumes luscious and the story gets more decadent. If you're an adult and interested in an equally noir tale of the Borgias, may I recommend Mario Puzo's The Family, especially the reading by Phillip Bosco? An escape from the corruption of our own time into that of another era...."
3,Tough going but worth it,"Ms. Chodorow does an excellent job of introducing and summarizing Carl Jung's concept of ""active imagination"" and its importance in becoming an ""individuated"" person. I'm currently bogged down in the middle of the book, though, due to the Jungian-ness of it all. (I've never found Jung's terminology to be straight forward or easily understandable...maybe it's just me.) I've jumped ahead and read other portions that seem more practical and have given me a much better idea of what the field is about. This would be a good textbook for a dance therapy program, but as a dancer, I sometimes felt it was too much up in the head (too intellectual) and not enough in the body"
1,"Before you buy this, learn about the ""author""","The so called ""author"" here has been accused of luring young foreign women to his home and keeping them as sex slaves. Do you really want to support him? Research his name on google news. After learning about the despicable things Yannai is accused of does it really matter whether or not the book is good? Buy something else."
4,"VERY nice car, but not all wood...","I love Plan Toys - they use recycled rubberwood and non-toxic dyes & finishes. Was very surprised, however, upon receipt to discover that the blue parts on this are NOT wood but FOAM. It is still a solid toy, but I would've liked to have know that before ordering. (For this, it gets 4 and not 5 stars.) It is also still a very good value - the rest is hardwood (except for plastic wheels & metal axles) and rides sturdily. Got this for my 1-year-old daughter, and she adores it. Her feet don't touch the ground, so we are careful pushing her on it that she doesn't slide off to one side. (I know it is recommended for older tots, but I couldn't wait!) She & I both love the underneath compartment for toy storage. Recommended!! Much better than toxic plastic!"
5,COOL TRUCK!,We love this little truck and our one year old son does too. We purchased a number of little trikes and ride on trucks for him and this is the best. The seats a bit wide for proper straddling until he's probably 2 but it's very cool looking and well made.
2,KD 3029 hone set,"This is definitely an economy set. The small hone is so poorly made it is useless. The large hone has very small 3/4"" long stones rivited to it that must be drilled out to install the larger stones included. I am surprised that KD would put their name on these. Definitely not worth the cost."
3,Not what I expected,"According to the description this reamer can be used to finish metal tubing. However, it has no steel cutting blades..."
2,La Cubana 726,"i have owned this dvd for a few yrs and lately have had a discussion about how the three kennedy women are depicted as heroins but have little to be concerned about. i found no heroism in putting up with lies deceit, and affairs other than a fat paycheck should anything happen to one of the Kennedy bros?However, the heroin i supported was Ms Sally Heming, who was property of a US Pres and a woman with whom a US Pres clandestinely raped and with who he produced many children.The strengh with which this young girl(in the beginning) handled the rapes and assaults by a president has to be heralded, and goes beyond proving what so many great black families have had to bear.I am a now a retired atty, from Wash, DC and have met and been befriended by the relatives of Sally Heming, and know for a fact more than this movie will tell.Humanity tops power..All errors are miner but i offer no apologies because i know that THE READERS WILL GET OVER THEM?"
5,Genuinely Unique,"I picked this up just based on the name and look of the CD. At first listen, it seemed like a collection of backbeats waiting for the rap to start kicking in (which it never does). Another listen has revealed an album rich with an ethereal atmosphere and passion. The atmosphere of this CD won't put you to sleep and will keep you guessing what's coming next. I look forward to the next release from Genuine Childs."
5,This is an amazing book!,"Garden Cuisine is a must read for vegetarians, vegans, or anyone simply looking to limit their meat intake and read about its benefits. Its eye-opening accounts of how the meat industry operates will tug at anyones heart strings; Another bonus of this book are the fantastic recipies in the end."
4,A Little bit of Both,This book I was not expecting much looking at the other reviews. The story part was interesting and there is a lot of points worth look further into.For a book written over a decade ago there is points brought up that were of no concern to the general public back then. Now in 2010 you look at it and say wow maybe this guy has some valid points.Then you get to the menus and recipes. I have tried a few of the recipes so far and they have come out wonderfully.Recipes say quick but there is a few like the enchiladas that take a long time to prepare.
1,"This should had been titled ""The Paul Wenner Story""","Wenner recounts how he overcame adversity to become a successful entreprenuer. I have over 100 vegetarian books and this is about the worse one I own (I don't know why I still have it in my collection). Yes, there are recipes, but most of them require using a Gardenburger. Why did I buy this book in the first place? I didn't, someone gave it to me as a birthday present."
5,Great reference,"I love this book! It has all sorts of natural ways to address things like insect repellants, disinfectants, and potpourri. (I especially liked the one on moths since I keep bird seed in the basement and wanted to repel moths that get in there). It also has a section on spices and herbs that talks to the origins of the different herbs/plants and how to use them. There's a nice section on teas and plants to use in teas. The section on ""Beauty Care"" has hair care, baths, foot care etc. There are recipes throughout - woven into the descriptions/discussions of the plants etc but in addition to there's lots of info about the plants and what they can be used for, how to use them. Then you can concoct the potion (or salad as the case may be) on your own too. Its an interesting book with lots of information."
1,disappointment,"Read this book in an afternoon, thought it would have different or more information in it, but it was disappointing. Nothing really new. Some of the information in the book, I don't I think I would trust to use. This book quickly went into my ""to be sold"" box."
5,Painting with Stitches,"Fabulous book! I've bought several copies, for me and to give to friends.Worth having for the vibrant photos alone."
3,Interesting book,"This book is in excellent condition and I was pleased with the images shown. I was just a little disappointed in that the author uses only one type of fabric for the embroidery and only a very few embroidery stitches. I mistakenly thought it would give more options. But nevertheless, I enjoy looking at the images in the book."
2,Good for one time use,"Bought this to go on a family vacation to Antigua, not meant for experienced swimmers. We ended up giving them to the little ones to play around in."
5,Great company and great computer,"My old G3 ibook died (which I had bought second hand) due to a defective motherboard. I sent the computer to Apple for repair, but supplies were on back order and would take more than a month to arrive. Apple subsequently sent me a brand new ibook G4 ""14 as a replacement, free of charge. Not only was my original G3 3 years old, but I was not even the original owner. It didn't matter. Apple treated me like a valuable customer. The ibook G4 is a great computer, and it's nice to have a company backing their products up with great customer service. Though I only used PCs before I got my original G3, I am now a lifelong Apple user."
3,Still trying to figure it out - Initial comments,"I've been a PC user all my life but decided to go Apple after hearing so many rave reviews from friends. Keep in mind that I was a master of my PC (with all of the shortcuts and tricks), aIt may just take time. Here are some initial comments after a few hours of playing around with my new iBook:Pros -Easy setup! took minutes to get the system running and updated!Beautiful machine - as much as I have always liked it, owning one feels differentCons -The screen does not open a full 180 degrees. Often I like to sit with my knees up and open my laptop completely flat, but this is not possible with an iBook.ctrl+arrows do not skip you over words if you are trying to navigate through a document (I use MS Word ALOT).Even though it comes with a 60GB, 20 GB was already full from programs and the OSI'll continue to update and add to this review as I learn more..."
4,Love it,"I really recommend any Apple product. I have this particular laptop, however, it's not fast enough. More resolution, more RAM, and a bigger processor is definately needed."
1,Techno Intelligence Wants to Rip you Off!,"The price on their ""new"" iboook g4 is outrageously expensive. It's about 400 more than they went for new, back in 2005(4 years ago)."
5,I love my G4 and my G4 loves me!,"I've had a 12"" iBook G4 since 2005 and it's still my favorite notebook for browsing the internet, writing letters, and even reading pdf's. It's very lightweight and I consider the screen the perfect size. It's held up very well. One of the keys has a hairline crack and one of the rubber feet on the bottom fell off but I clean it every month or so and it still looks almost new.My only criticism is that it gets a little warm so I keep it on top of a clipboard when holding it in my lap. No viruses, no crashes, no worries.When netbooks started becoming popular a couple of years ago, I had to laugh because I already have a lightweight, handy netbook. In fact, I'm using it right now to write this review. Given a choice between a new Asus or Dell netbook or a used iBook G4 for the same price, I would take the G4 without thinking about it for a second."
1,Fragile - both the case and the service,"I use a variety of notebooks. The iBook I owned had a very flimsy LCD screen. You can see this if you press on the case on the other side of the screen: the slightest pressure immediately distorts the screen. I don't see this effect on the Lenovo or Dell notebooks I use.Not surprisingly, the iBook screen was damaged (hairline ""cracks"" in the LCD screen) in less than 6 months. I don't know how this came about but I know the case was intact so I didn't drop the machine or drop anything heavy on the case.I purchased the Macintosh with a three year ""AppleCare"" warranty (at a very steep cost). Despite this, all Apple would offer me as a repair option was to replace the screen for $800. The new iBook was about $900.So, caveat emptor. The recent Wall Street Journal article on fragile iPod screens prompted me to write this. Seems that Apple continues to prefer style over substance."
5,very satisfied,I've been looking to buy an ibook for a while now. It far exceeds my Dell notebook capabilities in sounds and graphics. Garageband was one of the main reasons for switching to a Mac platform. It has given me a new world of possibilities for composing and recording adventures. The product was carefully sent in a safe and timely fashion. Thanks!
4,Muy Bueno,Creo que Reflexu`s es uno de los mejores grupos de música bahiana de Brasil. Conjugan a la perfección los ritmos afroamericanos. Me parece que las versiones de Madagascar Olodum O Senegal no tiene comparación con otros temas similares. Sin duda de los mejor que ha dado Brasil en la dácada del 80.
5,Gould 1 1/2 Irrigation Pump,Pump came very quickly. No problem in replacing my old pump with this one. So far it's doing a great job. I would have no problem from purchasing from this vendor again through Amazon.
2,One-size DOES NOT fit all.,"I was so excited when I saw these stockings and they were going to be the perfect little extra item for My Halloween costume. I am 5'4"" and even pulling these stockings all the way up, they are baggy and the holes look uneven. The top is super tight and uncomfortable. I will be returning these."
5,...an album you must hear !!,"Lonnie Smith - Move Your Hand , 1969 Blue Note RecordsA fews years back I totally got into Lonnie Smith after hearing live at Club Mozambique which totally blew me away. Recorded live in New Jersey's Club Harlem on August 9th 1969 this album totally grooves and grooves with a funky jazz that few live album can hold a candle to. This album was kindly remastered and released on the limited run of Blue Note's Rare Groove Series which are worth hunting for. Lonnie Smith is a jazz organist who loved funk as much as jazz and on ""Move Your Hand"" you will definitely need to move your feet ."
4,excellent,"OK. Housekeeping out of the way. Repeat after me: this-is-not-Lonnie-Liston-Smith. They are two different people. This-is-not-Lonnie-Liston-Smith. They are two different people.Alright. Actually, you'll never confuse the atmospheric jazz of that guy, who is not this guy, with Lonnie Smith. Both are great but entirely differentThis is great, Jimmy McGriff style soul jazz, with gripping bluesy riffs and James Brown vamping. There is not much origonal here, but with this salt-of-the earth music, that is the idea.The sax adds bone to the meatThis is music you can listen to all day, all night, year round.Fantatic steak and potatoes music. Lonnie List............(reviewer intentionally takes hammer to thumb) Ohhhhhhh, now I'm doing it too."
4,Starts off very strong,"This CD starts off extremely strong with pulsing sounds and beats. It has a lot of energy and succeeds in NOT becoming repetitive and annoying. Towards the end of the CD, it seems like they threw in the obligatory ambient/journey/experimental tracks that just don't go with the flow of the CD. No problem, though, there's plenty of good music before that."
1,Not good.,"But better than the Maxell and the Memorex that I bought around the same time. Those 2 skip and flip. In the TDK pack most of the tapes recorded. In the Maxell and Memorex packs, most did not record."
5,multiple pack,It was great to be able to still purchase VHS tapes. Not only that but to be able to obtain a 10 pack of VHS tapes.
5,Yeah--I can still get videotapes!,"It was a relief to find I could still purchase blank videotapes as they are getting hard to find. My VCR is still plugging along and I still need new tapes to record movies I hope to watch someday... if the VCR will hold out that long! Anyway, it was a good purchase, quick delivery, reasonable price. Thanks!"
2,Product received was not the same as product pictured,"I ordered the 8 hour VHS tapes, shown in pictured advertisement, but received 6 hour VHS tapes. Not as expected. I could have ordered 6 hour tapes elsewhere. I chose 8 but did not get 8. I didn't get what was advertised or expected.This makes me skeptical in regards to ordering in the future. I specifically looked for fine print stating there could be a substitution, but there wasn't any."
5,Video Tapes,"Again I rated this item as I did, because They are much cheaper here and easier to get, then going out to a store."
5,Great price,"I got these for my mom who is still in the dark ages of ""taping"" all her favorite shows. For whatever reason, she is more comfortable doing that than with the current options available.It was nice to be able to get a good sized pack of these at once and at such a reasonable price. For some reason, the ones in the store around here are like $4 EACH!!!! Blows my mind. They should be free! LOL"
4,Good tapes but don't buy online,"Many people are complaining here about damaged tapes. I have used these tapes for years and have never had a problem. HOWEVER, I don't ever buy tapes online, only in a store. I fear that tapes will get wrecked during shipment so I prefer to get them at a store. The tapes are good when you get a good batch. I have tapes that I recorded years ago (some as far back as 2004 and even earlier), and they still play almost perfectly now. It's a little more pricey to get them in a store versus on the internet but you will have a better chance of getting good tapes, so it's worth it."
3,PROBLEM WITH TDK 10 pack VIDEO TAPES,"I was originally very pleased to receive the 10-pack of blank video tapes.They were working fine, and the quality was equally fine.HOWEVER......One of the tapes was faulty. It was never attachedto the roll....and a piece of the tape was sticking out of theplastic holder. I am disappointed that the 10-pack did not provide10 good tapes. Is there a way to repair this? Or is it just rendered useless?"
5,great quality videotape brand,"TDK is a brand that offers great quality videotapes for your videotape library. I have used many TDK tapes,and I am always pleased with the quality picture and sound that I get from these tapes.The stand up very well with multiple use,and the quality show on any taping speed SP,LP,EP/SLP they all look good on TDK brand tapes.Good for capturing your favorite movies, or your families home videos."
1,This photo does not match the product. NOT AN 8 HOUR TAPE,The basic TDK tapes are fine and there are 10 in the pack. The photo does not match the description or the actual product received. These are not 8 hour tapes--they are 6 hour tapes. Misleading!!!!!!!!
2,Disappointed in Amazon,"I bought these tapes as part of a ""buy one pack of tapes from Amazon and get this TDK tape 10-pack [for a good price] from a different vendor"" promotion. I assumed that the TDK tapes were covered under Amazon's free shipping offer and did not realize, until I got the receipt in my email, that I was paying the outside vendor more in shipping costs than the price of this pack of tapes. To add insult to injury, the first tape in the pack did not work. Warning to all - if Amazon says a product is from a different vendor, go directly to the other website to see what you'll be paying before you buy it through Amazon!"
2,"Some OK, some not","The price was good, but the quality variable. I ordered two 10-packs, and some tapes seemed fine, while others were defective from the start. They didn't come packaged as 10-packs, but rather were loose tapes in a box. I've already thrown out two (and missed the programs I'd taped on them), and I haven't assessed all of them yet.I usually am very pleased with Amazon and will continue to use them, but this purchase was definitely a let down. If it had been my first, it would have been my last. Fortunately it was not a high-dollar item.Buyer beware, and I'd say it's a good time to switch to a DVD recorder!"
2,Volume is not always better!!,Majority of tapes were of low quality. Used in three different VCRs and tapes recorded with poor quality and played off track. The edges were dragging onto bottom of case. Probably old stock. Not cost effective to return. Thrown away. Will buy local in the future.
2,malfuctioning and low quality,"Two of the five tapes I've used so far had malfunctioning cassettes that I had to toss. Another goes in and out of black and white and color. As the saying goes, ""You get what you pay for."" In this case, pay for another package. This isn't worth it."
3,good chance to buy VHS tape,"It is difficult to buy VHS tape in store. Not so high quality product, but not so high price and good enough."
4,tdk 120 tapes,the tapes I have use for years and they are as good as anything out in the market the tapes were less expensive that 4 years ago I will continue use them if they are still in the businesss
1,vcr tapes are no good,i have used 3 of the 10 pack and so far all three have messed up. they get caught in the vcr and you have to pull the tapes out. they do not rewind all the way. just beware
3,Review of TDK standard video tapes,"Bought to replace older similar tapes. On my VCR, the image jiggles when played. When played on my husband's combo VCR/DVD or sit up and played on that equipment, the image does not jiggle. My VCR is older but never had this problem on various brands of tapes used in the past."
1,False Advertising,"They show you a picture of an 8-hr tape but send you the 6-hr tapes, this is an example of a bait and switch play on customers."
1,Save the trouble,"Regardless of what it makes you remember about your buddys from college or whatever, there is very, very little new or exciting about this track. Save Tonight is merely another plodding four-chord song, which maybe rocks the first time you hear it, but then gets very, very dull. Same with the lyrics - matching ""fire"" with ""desire""? Come on people, it's already been done!The rest of his debut CD wasn't much better, and his new song ""Are you still having fun"" is another 4-song plodder like ST. No wonder Eagle-Eye names his family connections at every possible opportunity - he ain't gonna get legit quick playing stuff like this."
5,SIMPLY THE BEST!!!,This song reminds me of my friends back home! I came to Amerika from South-Africa and the night before I left my friends gave me a farewell party and played this song for me. This is one of the best songs I've ever heard! Keep on making great music!!!
5,Eagle-Eye Cherry flys high on my chart,"Save Tonight, a newly released song by Eagle Eyed Cherry, caught my ear on MTV. It is fresh out the box, exciting, different and just plain brilliant. This single combines intruiging and thoughtful lyrics with music that is both relaxing and inspiring to listen to. Not only 'Save Tonight', but also most of the songs on Eagle Eyed Cherry's new album, are definitely on my list for their originality and sense of 'fun'. If you are looking for something that is not trendy club music or tear jerking love songs... Eagle Eyed Cherry will provide you with something you can actually just lie back and listen to!!"
2,Smaller than expected and bad in color,"Ok, I havent used it yet. But really disappointed with the look of it.I wanted to buy something like a centerpiece on the table.The color is also not uniform. I thought this was a bright red one. But its now. It has this small black dots all over which are not even uniform and looks ugly."
5,Quality you can afford,"I've purchased many of these items 7 months ago from Amazon. They're affordable, quality fine china, plus they offer many variations on this line. Even with Macy's super sale, Amazon still beat their price by several dollars, plus they were delivered perfectly."
5,Fun colors and lightweight,I was attracted to this dinnerware in a store because of the bright colors. Then we I picked one up and it was incredibly lightweight. I just hate all the heavy plates that are on the market now. This is about the same weight as Corelle plates but not so then. I ordered 22 plates because we have a large family & 8 grandchildren. All the plates fit in the cabinet comfortably & in one stack and that makes a huge difference for storing dishes for that many people. I look forward to many years with this set. Amazon also did a fabulous job of packing the peices for shipment.It's not possible to do a better job than Amazon and I got free shipping to boot.
3,not THAT hypnotizing,"As the last reviewer said: this may be the best cd from the Hypnotizing records,but that doesn't mean much.Don't get me wrong,this IS a pretty decent trance cd but that's it. Some tracks really get you moving and some are rather relaxing(that's the 2nd cd)but i just feel like there's not enough depth in there, sometimes the tracks get repetitive. I didn't want to come to comparison but Astral Projection,Hallucinogen,Juno Reactor and Shpongle all beat this cd to a pulp. All in all this compilation deserves some respect,just not too much."
3,High Energy Megamixes of Pop Artist Hits,"This is a 2 CD set of 9 to 12 minute High Energy Megamixes or ""Medleys"". The Medleys feature one Artist or Group each. The recording, music and mixing are great. I rated this 3 stars because THE VOCALS ARE NOT BY THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS. This was the only thing that I was disappointed with. Made in Australia."
4,Interesting...,"It was my first time to go deeply into some of the prophecies and prophets. This book really got me throughout end of the book. It contains his birth to his death... It also contains ALL of his prophecy in order, relating with his life events. You will suprised by how much this book tells about his life."
5,living in the light of death,"This book is brilliant..........using death awareness as subject, the author shows us how we can actually live in freedom now, today. His clear, experiential understanding of the dharma is revealed over and over again throughout and his convicted and loving embrace of it is an amazing gift, given graciously, to us all. One of the finest dharma books ever written!"
3,Not the best McFerrin,"While McFerrin's Bang!Zoom delivers quality music, the album lacks much of the unique vocal style that McFerrin has made popular. The music is good, but does not equal the excitement and originality of his other releases."
5,The last dance,"As a loyal IMF fan since the series was on the air, it was great to see the last season again in DVD. The writing was excellant as usual, but upon reflection it seemed a waste to have a super trained government agency battle domestic crime. I was pondering as I was watching these episodes, where was the FBI,the ATF, or the US marshalls? However the plots where great, the ""scam"" (I guess punked in today's world} worked to perfection as usual. I do hope they put the 80's series on DVD it would complete the collection.......good luck Jim!"
5,Best season,"While most series seem to get slightly tired with each new season, this was my favorite (although I haven't seen season 6 since it's not available on prime)."
4,Interviews with IMF cast do exist!,"I wish I could recall the title of this PBS doco that dealt with American television of the 195's-1970's, The did theme shows , Sci-Fi, Westerns, Crime etc and there are great interviews with about 4 of the IMF casts talking about the shows, Leonard Nimoy, Peter Graves, Martin Landau & Barbera Bain. Peter Lupus still works out and Nimoy could do an interview ONLY if Paramount were not so cheap and pay these actors to share their stories of working on the show.Come on Paramount it is we the fans who will buy such a dvd extra on say MI movie number 5.You do want to make us happy and turn more profits in sales right?"
1,broken!,"I bought this watch for father's day, a GIFT , and the box leaves broken!! so what i do now??"
3,"Handsome watch, but scratches easily","Good looking watch. Extra-large (47 mm). I love the band. Crystal is plastic, though, so it scratches very, very easily. Overall decent every-day watch."
4,Nice Watch,Ive been buying Swatch watches for while.The Price on this was cheaper than other places i saw . Can be worn casual and formal . People have given positive comments about it.
3,"Great Sound, Not So Great Performance","It is good to hear Handel's youthful psalm setting in SACD and there certainly isn't much competition for the Caldara. The choral work is OK, a little squally in the sopranos and shaky in intonation. The period orchestra is colorful and plays pretty well. What sinks this recording, for me, is the effortful singing of Handel's solo lines in the Dixit setting. Intonation is shaky and the hooty, insecure sound of the countertenor in ""Virgam virtutis"" almost made me take the disc out of player. The tenor soloist won't win any prizes either. The light voiced bass is the best of the lot.The choral work improves in the Caldara, but the complaints about soloists apply here as well. I suspect most prospective purchasers will be buying this disc primarily for the Handel and the competition (Parrott's complete Carmelite Vespers, from which the work is extracted, on EMI to cite one) is simply too strong to recommend this effort, great sound notwithstanding."
3,"Fun, blemished recording","I mainly write to confirm what an earlier reviewer suggested: yes, the Handel is a *treacherously* difficult work to sing, perhaps even more for the choir than for the soloists.This entire recording, btw, is (currently!) up on YouTube. Do a search on ""handel dixit dominus""; it's in four parts, the one with the baldacchino graphic.I personally think this is a ""fun"" recording of the work, owing to the tempi and the continuo instrumentation. There are a few vocal problems here and there."
3,andrew jackson audio book,"When I go on a vacation road trip I like to ""read a book"" as one of my activities. Audio while I am driving, read the real thing while sitting around.This abridged audio is a waste of money for me. It reads like one of my high school history books and skips the details and the writing skills of the author.Since I no longer have to cram for next weeks test, I will stick to the full versions."
3,Fascinating author on radio; less so in print,"I heard Professor Brands interviewed at length on the radio, and found his comments about Andrew Jackson absolutely fascinating! Surprisingly, that's not the sense I got reading through the biography.Where's the beef? The Jacksonian Era was the lengthened shadow of this gray character? One doesn't expect a Martin Van Buren to jump off the page, but Ol' Hickory?!Interesting sidelight: Henry Clay (Lincoln's hero) turns out to be an implacable enemy of Jackson."
3,Average biography,"This book gives a reader the feeling that it is product of graduate students' research slapped together by Professor Brands. It is full of extended quotes rather than analysis and uses research from previous Brands' books on Texas history and the California gold rush. As to substance, the discussion of the contoversy surrounding the Second Bank of the United States does not really explain the context of the fight, rather it focuses on the personalities of Jackson and Biddle. More space is spent on the Indian wars than on Jackson's presidency. Moreover, the author does not, in my opinion, spend enough time discussing Jacksonian Democracy, an extremely important theme in US history. All in all, a decent book but not a really good one."
3,There are better choices for a Jackson biography,"I purchased this book based on the favorable reviews on this site, but I was disappointed with it. Some significant events in Jackson's life are covered too briefly. The book is not one that ""pulls you in"" and I found it tedious to get through 560 pages. (Not like a bio written by David McCullough)."
4,Andrew Jackson: So much more than we thought.,"I have read many Presidential biographies, and I rate this one right next to ""John Adams"" by McCullough. I only wish that when I was in school studying American History, writers like Brands were writing the history texts. They read like novels and I find myself wondering how a man like Andrew Jackson was only glossed over in history classes."
4,Son of a young America,"With the biography of A.J. it is possible to follow the develop of the U.S. from a young Colony to a Nation that want to build his future with courage and passion. The narration is clear and well articulated; it is possible to notice already the mainstreams of the political thinking that are directing the national choices till now. A.J. is described like a passionate, brave and resolute leader that pushed forward the Nation to the greatness. He rappresents a peoples mentality that maybe is disappeared."
2,Surprisingly bad,"Considering both the author and the subject matter, this was surprisingly bad.Jackson's election was the first election of a president by ""the people"" (the people bing white, male, and in some states, just property owners). How did this happen and what did it mean for the country - you won't find out here.And Jackson as president had a significant impact on how the federal government of the United States operated, from federalism (handling South Carolina's attempt to succeed), to the National Bank, to the proposed expansion of the conuntry.So how were each of these handled and what did it mean? Again, you won't find out much here. Yes Jackson made a toast to the preservation of the Union and yes that was important. But according to this book that was it.The book reads easily and is good up through the battle of New Orleans. But it doesn't tell you much about Jackson's impact on our government and country. Yet that is why he is so important."
2,Get Your PHD in English BEFORE Reading This One,"This book was very thourough and would probably be best for someone who is into Andrew Jackson and American History big time. The writter tends to go on and on in some cases.You better bone up on your English vocabulary through and through before tackling this book. Brands used words in his book that I have, quite honestly, never seen or heard of before. I may be a little challenged in that department but this made the reading difficult for me and lost my interest in what he was trying to convey.For someone wanting the basics on Andrew Jackson's life and times without all the flair I would look elsewhere."
4,Interesting and readable,"This is an interesting and readable biography of a sometimes contradictory subject. As with so many presidential biographies, the ""pre-presidential"" years are the most interesting, as we learn how Jackson earned his reputation and his chronic injuries. The presidential years dwell somewhat on dry subjects such as the federal bank.Most interesting about Jackson are his contradictions, he favored states rights and then fought to preserve the union. He knew Indians on a personal level better than any president before or since, yet his Indian policy could be downright cruel."
2,Poor design,"The curling bench was well built...but the adjustment knob for raising the arm pad up and down is located on the side of the bench where you place your right leg. I believe the photo of the product intentionally does not show the bench from the front or opposite angle to hide this design flaw from the purchaser. The curling bench is usable, but uncomfortable and poorly designed."
3,"Great Sound Quality and Battery Life, but not a Rio","I'm such a spoiled..., i just love to navigate through a mp3 cd (RioVolts did it beautifully, but the battery life is horrible) and this device just isn't friendly that way...a downright pain in the... if you have a bunch of random songs. Additionally, the resume feature only works on one cd and starts at the beginning of the track (again, RioVolts do multiple cd resuming and resume wherever you are in the track). Best sound quality and battery life I've ever had the pleasure of partaking of in a cd/mp3 player though...the concert hall setting makes the sounds resonate beautifully. Oh ya, one more bad thing...no protective case...which is a must with these delicate and thinly designed cd players."
2,"Slick look,.......But that's pretty much it.","I was on the prowl. Searching for an mp3/cd player at low cost, and amazing sound, both volume and levels. I got this player and although it looks very cool indeed, it's still weak. There's no fastforward or rewind in songs! What's that about? How could you not add that? To get to song 160 you have to click the forward button 159 times! Very inconvenient. But that wouldn't bother me at all! If the sound was blow me away, amazing. But it wasn't, it was what you would expect from a generic cd player. I need loud and I need bass. I also bought new koss headphones for this thing and still, dull sound. I can't yet point you to the perfect mp3/cd player. But trust me, it's not this."
1,Caution Regarding Resume Feature,"The product description on the Amazon site says that ""resume picks up EXACTLY where the player left off"". That is not correct. The owner's manual correctly says that ""the player stores the TRACK where you stopped play"". When you restart the player, it will start at the BEGINNING OF THE TRACK where you left off. That may work for some people, but not for those who want to pick up play in the middle of a long track. Amazon should correct the product description on its site!"
3,"Some good ones, but pretty montononous and uncreative","After listening to it for a long time, I like it, but it isn't as good as my other techno CDs. Track 8-11 and 4 are the good ones, but the first one and some other ones aren't so good. If you like really monotonous techno, you will probably like this, but if it seems a bit TOO monotonous, I recommend buying Technotheque vol. 3."
3,Zipper Pouch,"All in all not bad for the price, but a little small for my glock 33. Plenty big for my kel-tec p3 though. I'd like to see it have a stiffer back. Convenient and preferable to me over a fanny pack."
5,Perfect for Ruger LCR,"I have a Ruger LCR .38 with Hogue grip laser. It fits very well in this Uncle Mike's bag. It has a small separate pouch on the outside of the bag that nicely holds two 5 Star Firearms speedloaders.In interior of the bag has two compartments. One for storing your piece in a concealed compartment and another if you want to carry ID or something like a small camera.The Ruger LCR is a fine handgun and conceals well. There are times it's more comfortable to carry the LCR in the Uncle Mikes or I'm wearing attire where the handgun isn't fully concealed.There are also times I carry the bag and don't belt it. It works well for that too. If you have a Ruger LCR and CHL, you can't go wrong with this bag."
4,Great pocket guide!,"Contains what all (good) travel guides do -- historical background, hotels, eating, nightlife, shopping.Pluses: good coverage of French Quarter attractions; lists plenty of moderate and inexpensive restautants and hotels; helpful tips on navigating the city; easy-to-use maps; compact formatMinuses: index is not comprehensive (if you're looking for a particular restauant, hotel, or attraction, you have to browse the appropriate section); lodging and restaurant guides are selective, not comprehensive (doesn't mention Antoine's!)Other: focuses heavily on the French Quarter, but also contains information for the rest of the city and surrounding area; contains information for gay travelers (clubs, gay-friendly hotels, etc.)We (physically) looked at a variety of guides, and this is the one we chose. If it doesn't live up to expectations, expect a follow-up review after our vacation!"
2,Webster ASL Dictionary,-Not a user-friendly program-Poorly oranized software-No configuration options at all-Impractical and slow unless you have a very fast CD drive
5,Amazing,"I've had this blush for forever and it is just amazing. I'm such a huge fan. I just take my brush, swipe it down the middle and it's an amazing blush for everyday! It has such high amounts of pigments in the two colors you really do not need to have a ton on. A little goes a long way with this product."
4,Good but not for the money,"It's good bronzer, but not unlike other, less expensive bronzers. I do like the product though. I wish the price was lower."
2,Very limited,"Actually more like 2.5 stars. Plusses: While organized by English alphabetical order, it gives kanji or kana as well. Minuses: Just not enough; not enough subdefinitions, not enough usage notes, and big time not enough words. I bought this because it was compact and I thought good for travel, but the place I'm living (in Japan) has the Oxford mini-dictionary, which is smaller in size and much more comprehensive. I've read other reviews and am going to check out the Langenscheidt too.A word to the wise: The name Webster's, cannot be copyrighted, and thus is no guarantee of quality. I got burned on this one."
2,It's a dictionary but...,"I took this thing with me on a trip to Japan...and found it to be totally useless. Of the ~60 words I looked up, I actually found 2...What a joke."
5,Great Little Compact Book,"This handy little compact pocket dictionary is just what I needed to learn Japanese meaningsas well as spelling and even writing.It is a little hard to read the words without my reading glasses due tothe small print, but nonetheless it was very nice to have it fit intomy pocket or purse and take with me anywhere.It was shipped quickly and securely.I highly recommend it."
3,small and imcomplete,this is just a quick pocket dictionary good for a few helpful words and phrases.
4,"An easy to use, for everyday work, Japanese dictionary","The most words for common usage are listed, but more advanced technical terms cannot be found. Thats a shame to an in other ways good book."
1,Not worth your money,"The ""Pie Every Day"" idea is great in concept, but the results of these recipes leave much to be desired. After I had tried two recipes and didn't like them, I passed the book on. That person tried a recipe, and didn't like it. I passed it on to yet another person, and they've tried two recipes and haven't liked them. For someone who has pies very rarely, these recipes may be a revelation, but for accomplished cooks and for pie-savvy diners, I cannot recommend the book. The best result we've achieved thus far falls into the ""not very tasty"" category, others are just plain awful. This is definitely one of those cookbooks that looks great on the shelf, reads great on the cover, but fails the test of the palate where it counts."
1,Different expectations,"When I bought this book, I had very limited experience in baking pies. Based on the title, I was expecting some basic pie recipes (for example, blueberry pie or peach pie). What I found instead were a Flaming Peach Pie and a Blueberry-Whipped Cream Pie. There is a recipe for A Common Apple Pie, however it calls for sugar(no amount) and ground cinnamon (no amount). The author writes that it is intentionally imprecise because there are so many variables to consider, however I would have liked some kind of guideline for the inexperienced pie maker. I did find the chapter on pie crusts very informative, unfortunately, when I tried making the Butter and Lard Crust, it turned out a little too tough. Finally, I have not found this book very useful to me and the type of pie recipes I was expecting."
5,The Gold Standard,"I purchased a copy of this book for my dad, because he is definitely someone who would be perfectly happy to eat pie every day. I started looking through it before wrapping it & ended up buying a copy for myself, having inherited my dad's love of pie. It has since become my absolute favourite cookbook, not only for cooking from but just for the sheer pleasure of reading the prose. It's the one by which I judge other cookbooks. The stories are wonderful - heartfelt & well-written. The recipes are very good as well. Her Shaker Lemon Pie has become a family favourite. Mmmmm.... edible sunshine!"
1,for history buffs only,"I ordered this album after attending a live performance of the work by the St Louis Symphony. This is probably one of Mahler's finest works and this performance may have been a great one but it was never captured sonically. The noise and distortion from the original 1951 recording process is unbearable.If you are interested in a history of performances like this, you may be happy with the album. For me, it serves no other purpose."
3,"A ""heavyweight"" for your library","This is no small volume, and that is to the good. Many words are covered between its bindings and it can serve as a primary ""go to"" in your library."
4,Barnhart's... The Life of Your Next Party!,"Barnhart's is a word-lover's dream. I enjoy taking it off the shelf and flipping aimlessly to a page, just to see what I'll learn next. As a reference it is very useful and thorough (although there are no pronunciation guides, as in a normal dictionary). As interesting reading, it is even more promising. Learn the history of such words as: freckle, pagoda, and carcass! One drawback: it's just not very portable. If Barnhart's is to be your constant companion, check to see if there's a paperback or desk size available."
2,"Not REAL Bad, but...","I purchased this scanner for its ability to scan transparancies, and so far it seems to be doing the job. However, compared to my primary scanner (Lexmark X5150), I found using it as a stand-alone very confusing and finally started using it only through my PaintShop Pro 7. When it's in operation, it sounds as if it's grinding coffee, and there's now a very discernable (and growing) streak on the inside of the glass. I'd swap it out if it had been purchased locally, but for what it cost, I'm not going to bother, since it's already paid for itself over what it would have cost to have the transparencies scanned.It's not bad as an auxiliary scanner, but if it's to be your ONLY scanner, it just doesn't seem likely to hold up. Caveat emptor!"
1,Locked up and is now unusable.,"I wouldn't buy another Visioneer product in a million years. The scanner functioned well for a short time, then gave me an error message that it was locked. It's not. Visioneer offers no solution on its site, even though many many other customers seem to be having the same problem."
5,Desn't cost $999.99,This scannner is not noware near worth a thousand dollars. It is only worth 20.00 at the most.
5,A great book,"I found this book to be very fun to read. I am a JAG lover and felt that Mr. Tine, expressed the characters true to how they are shown on TV. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read or lover of JAG."
5,You'll love it,"The story is exciting and would be a wonderful base for an episode of JAG ( next season perhaps *hinthint*'Cleverness and fairness of the JAG lawyers are shown with much perfection. Some well hidden, but deep friendship showing moments, are given, too. *shipperheartbeatinghere*A big must for all the JAG Fans out there :)"
3,Okay,"I got this book for Christmas. It was an easy reader, very short and not too hard of words. It was hard to keep up with all the characters at times. The characters thoughts weren't as deep as what you get on the show. The plot was okay, but not very creative. And I didn't feel that it was in the spirit of the show, not at all family oriented. DO NOT GIVE IT TO A CHILD! I'm 14,and I found that there was A LOT of cursing and inappropriate words. My mom wanted to read it, so I had to go back through and mark out half the book. On the other hand, there's a lot of action."
3,live lester near his peak,"The value of this recording is the live banter between Lester and his sidemen. The apparent joy and laughter among the group gives a great insight into Lester's playing at this period of his career - however, this is only for serious Lester fans, otherwise, the somewhat poor sound quality will eventually turn off average listeners. More lively than his studio recordings of the same period."
2,Buy these artists on other CDs,"I found it disappointing. Lester Young did too much improvising for my taste. Many of the pieces sounded more like what Lester Young thought the composer had in mind than what the composer actually wrote. The exceptions were the pieces with Sara Vaughn singing. However, the richness of her voice was lost. It sounded like she was either singing inside an empty steel barrel or in a hall with bare concrete ceiling, floor, and walls. Also, there seemed to be a low-level vibration in the background. Both of these artists have much better CDs. Buy them instead."
1,Died after 2 weeks,I ordered 2 of these 2x1GB memory upgrade kits. They seemed to install easy enough but about 2 weeks after install 1 of my pairs had died on me. Computer could not boot because of it. After swapping some sticks around I was able to isolate the problem to 1 pair of modules.The other is still working (for now)...and while I understand failure happens with everybody...I will not likely buy PNY memory again as I will go with a more reliable brand.
1,DOA,"Just received 2 x 1 GB kit in the mail, installed it and nothing, power on, no POST, no Beeps. Called PNY's tech line went through the phone steps to get live support, just to be given their voice mail :( very unhappy"
1,Fried my MB and Samsung monitor,Installed memory to my motherboard and it fried my MB and monitor? Basically had to throw away both my monitor and my motherboard
3,Be careful!,"I wish I had read the reviews more closely before I ordered. I have a Dell Latitude D610 (very old) that I wanted to squeeze a little more life out of by upgrading to 2GB. It uses PC2-4200 but according to my research on the internet PC2-5300 ""should work"", and the PNY packaging says: ""compatible with 400Mhz, 533Mhz, 667Mhz"". Like others here have said these modules may not actually be 667Mhz modules and hence may not be backward compatible with older machines. Thankfully, Amazon has a great return policy and didn't hesitate 1 second to issue an RMA. Good luck!"
5,I am Happy,"Had no issues installing the RAMs in my Dell Vostro 200 mini tower. It works fine and my Main Memory size now is 3GB in total. Also got a coupon code for downloading a FREE movie from PNY site. Though there are no recent movies there i am downloading ""Surf's Up"" for my kid to watch. Overall it is well worth the money!!"
2,Had Problems with this PNY memory,I bought this PNY memory as it was the one speced by them for my Dell computer.I have had nothing but problems after I installed it.Bought another brand (Crucial) and that worked perfectly.Be guided accordingly.
2,Not necessarily compatible with all 533MHz computers,"While the Amazon product descirption and the package insert notes that the memory runs at 667Mhz and is compatible with systems running at 533 MHz, this is not strctly so. Wile some (most?) computers needing 533MHz memory will accept this product, some older computers like my EMachines T5082 require 533MHz memory and only 533MHz DDR2 memory. Be forewarned: downwards compatibilty is not guaranteed.A call to PNY cleared this up for me. I sent this back and ordered PNY MD2048KD2-533 from Amazon instead."
5,PNY OPTIMA 2GB (2x1GB) Dual Channel Kit,"Great price, and PNY always puts out a great product. Inexpensive way to improve your computers performance; especially if you have resource gobbling VISTA."
3,Memory What?,"These two stick of memory have increase my RAM by the amount located on the box. I contacted this seller through Amazon and said give me a break, Give me a break, Break me off a piece of that memory stick!Very Quick Ship and Very reliable product!!!"
2,Arrived Promptly but did not work in the computer I ordered it for.,"No problem with the vendor, shipped promptly. Arrive securely packaged and brand new. It just did not work in the computer I ordered it for even thought the ad for the product had a method of selecting the right memory by computer model number.I was careful to put the memory in the correct slots according to the computer maker. With this memory installed the computer would not boot. When I took it out and replaced the original memory it started fine.disappointed and out some money but not angry with the vendor"
4,Matched pair is required sometimes,"Some experts claim that all memory is interchangeable and works with other memory but for my computer, this is not true. Some computers do require memory to be installed in matching pairs. Matched pairs only means that they must be the same specifications and manufactured from the same lot.I also learned that 32 bit computers are limited. That is, a computer may be upgradeable to 4GB memory (RAM) but if the computer is only 32 bits (instead of the newer 64 bits) then, it will only use 3GB memory no matter how much you install.Sometimes, you get 'duds' in memory so knowing the return policy is important.Future, I will study my specific computer specifications better."
4,Desktop Memory,THe memory seems to work okay. Found it at less than half of the price I give two days later. I'll just have to pay closer attention on any future purchases.
4,RAM,"The speed of my computer is so much faster.I'm not able to get both stick to work at same time,could be something I'm doing wrong,but I like having 1 GB also"
1,Memory was defective,"Purchased for an upgrade for one of my computers. Put it in the computer and all seemed well untill it ran for a few hours, Windows kept crashing due to memory issues. I would not reccomend buying these due to what I see as a quality issue."
1,Not recognized by computer,"Computer would not boot up with ram installed. After testing, it was found that one of the sitcks were defective."
2,For Shame!!!!,"i would of given it one star if it wasn't for the fact that my computer worked with what they sent. the product is advertised as a 5300 ram and i was sent 4200...HUGE difference, would of given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the wrong kind of RAM."
1,Stopped Working in Dell Optiplex 745,"ORIGINAL: Great memory, great price, no problems. The package even has a coupon for a free movie, so don't throw it out without looking! :) If you put it in a Dell Optiplex, you have to pull out the existing 2 x 512MB chips (they're in the slots with the white clips) and put in the new 2 x 1GB chips. Then you can put the original 2 x 512MB in the slots with the black clips. Basically, you have to put them in pairs, and the slots white clips need to have your largest memory modules.UPDATE: with no warning, the new RAM stopped working after several weeks without problems. One day there was simply no booting up and a ""RAM error"". We removed the RAM, put the old RAM in, and it worked. Then when we reinstalled the new RAM (again in the proper slots), but no go. We removed the RAM and now have no idea what to do with it. I tossed the packaging when it had been working a few weeks, not imagining it would spontaneously fail later.I hope this is a rare case."
3,2 gig upgrade.,"Hi,I was hoping to be able to tell the speed difference after the upgrade. I went from a 1 gig to now a 3 gig memory. After installing it, I really can't or don't see any change. My main reason for this purpose was to play games at a higher level of speed. What can I do???Pam Greaves"
3,PNY OPTIMA (2x1Gb) PC2-5300 Dual Chan.Great Memory,Very good price with excellent deliver time. Product was easy to install and works great. My customer is very satisfied with the increase in speed of his system after installing this product.The only negative was that the description listed by the seller did not indicate that originally the wrong memory was bought for his computer and later sold as NEW to me (after being handled and possibly installed into his system). BUt overall good.
2,Not a good buy,This memory is usless to me. I have a 775 dual motherboard and this memory crashs the board regulary. Ran Memtest and found one chip is junk and the other just barely functional. ie Bad spots all through the first and only a few bad spots on the latter. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS. Try Kingston
2,"Memory works fine, REBATE does not","I bought this memory and it works fine. I sent the rebate to PNY and they sent a postcard stating ""missing receipt"" I did send a copy of the transaction but there is not a ""receipt"" included in a online transaction."
2,not good.,"Install them for less than 5mins, the PC started to beep, and shut down. Took out one of the modules and PC works fine. put that one module to every memory slot available, same problem. so its pretty much half DOA. Wanted to get it replaced, but not in stock anymore. Probably will get it from another brand from now on. Of course Amazon is the best and I could just return it. And at least get my money back."
5,Best deal I could find,If this is the memory you need this is the best deal I could find. I checked lots of sights including all of the major electronics stores and this was the best I could find. Just make sure this is the type you need.
5,2x1GB DDR2 Memory Modules,I like the way the games load and play faster although my pc is about 5 years old.I recieved the product in a few days and was so pleased with the performance I would recommend it to anyone wanting to put a little more speed in there pc.Thanks Amazon.
2,failed after 3 months,We ordered this ram to install in a Dell Optiplex GX280 in the office. Once we installed the ram the computer was alot faster and everything was fine until yesterday when i got a call saying that the computer would not boot to the operating system and all it would show is a black screen after the DELL logo. So i figured it had to either be the ram or the video card and i told him to swap the new ones out (PNY) with the old ones that were originally in there and what do you know... It worked fine!!! So all that i can say is i would not reccomend buying this ram because it failed in three months and thats not what i had expected from this company.
4,RAM Upgrade,"Excellent product and easy to install. Noticed immediate improvement in performance. This was my last upgrade to max out my computers capacity at 4GB's. Originally purchased with only 1GB. Now that RAM is inexpensive, everyone should consider upgrading."
5,Worked great for a computer i was upgrading,"Worked flawlessly, stuck them on the mobo and they were instantly recognized. I was upgrading a computer for a client which had bought a computer a while ago that came with windows vista but hardware that would be considered 'ok' even on WinXP. Needless to say the computer was extremely slow. I bought a new cpu along with the RAM and it went from barely being able to handle one youtube video at 360p, to handling about 5 to 6 videos simultaneously at 480p before maxing out."
1,Garbage,Attempted to upgrade a Dell Inspiron 530S from 2GB to 4GB of Ram using these 2 1GB module. One prevented the computer from booting at all. The other failed Dell diagnostics memory test. Thank you Amazon for your return policy.
5,A memorable book -- too bad it's out of print,This is a popular computer book about data compression and data representation. It was first published way back in 1989 and now eleven years later it's not in the slightest bit out of date. How many popular computer books can you say that about?
1,Luke warm coffee,"If you don't like your coffee hot this is perfect for you. The model I bought is FTXSS43-2, purchased at wall-mart, it has a small rectangular clock and no adjustable warming plate. Its barely warm right after brewing, no way you can burn your mouth after taking a big guzzle, after adding cold cream I need to microwave it or drink it cold. I don't add that much cream either, just a little splash. I needed to add more coffee than before because I think the lower brewing temperature is not extracting the full flavor out of the beans. I wanted to like this thing because it looks really good, but why can't they make it brew at a higher temperature? I had a Hamilton Beach brew station deluxe prior to this model and it made very hot coffee. I'm taking this useless thing back, I like hot coffee. I think I will try a Cuisinart, they get great reviews."
2,Mediochre multicultural New Age,"Having heard that the Portuguese band Madredeus was so big in Europe, I bought this with the hope that it would be more typical Portuguese pop music. In that sense, I was setting myself up for disappointment, because this band is more like ethereal New Age ala Enya, with Portuguese lyrics and several instrumentals. If that is what you're looking for, this is good. But it's by no means rock or pop."
4,Sufficiently chilling 1920's English-Manorhouse Thriller,"To be brief,HAUNTED is an excellent ghost story,well acted,well-scripted and beautifully filmed.Why 4 stars? Having had the advantage of seeing THE OTHERS,SIXTH SENSE and THE CHANGELING before seeing HAUNTED,I had figured out everything by the first quarter of the film-AND I WAS RIGHT,TOO!That should not stop you though from seeing this movie highlighted by the performances of the deliciously smarmy Anthony Andrews (of BRIDESHEAD REVISITED fame) as the VERY creepy older brother to and equally chilling Kate Beckinsale as his baby sister.WHAT A PAIR THESE TWO ARE! What can one say about Aidan Quinn but that he is always good at what he does.Had I have seen HAUNTED before the above-mentioned films I probably would have given it the extra star.Still,HAUNTED is sufficiently chilling,creepy,ghosty and spooky-all the things that a good tale of horror should have!"
1,Must have missed something,"I watched this movie two days ago and I'm still annoyed with it. At first, right after the movie ended I thought ""Well that wasn't awful"". But the more I think about it, the more plot holes I find. I wont go into them because I hate spoliers in reviews but they were plentiful. As far as the rest of the moive, the acting wasn't bad, the special effect will not wow anyone, and Kate is at least partially nude for most of the movie. I would not recommend watching this movie unless perhaps you invent a drinking game to go along with it. Kate is topless - drink, weird look from nanny - drink, Aidan doesn't believe in ghosts - drink, odd family situation - drink etc."
3,haunt,"This is the film of person who really love the horror movie could be enjoy it. It is good movie and I just really like to collect it, watch it if you like the mystery movie. This is reviewed from video disc."
2,Rent it first,"Another film that was purchased before renting it due to some of the glowing reviews.Overall, it failed to excite the imagination and remains another dud DVD in my library."
1,Yawn.,"This movie just plain stinks. Just don't watch it. See Poltergeist, The Amityville Horror or The Innocents. They are much better. This was not scary at all, and the acting stunk. Don't see this!"
2,ughhh!!! shave them 'pits Kate. they be stinkin'!!!,movie was fairly boring.Beckinsale is also pretty dumb.What kinda actress doesn't shave her armpits when she knows she has to do a nude scene.A total turnoff!!!
2,"Visually beautiful, but forgettable","Ghost story. Gorgeous to look at the period locations, costumes & make-up. Held the attention, but the story was ultimately unsatisfying, my friend & I agreed."
1,Thought it was very slow and predictable,"I just thought it would be fun to get a scary movie and this was not it. However enjoyable it was nontheless a typical ""scary movie"" It had the little girl in the victorian era white dress, the childrens whispers in the middle of the night, the scratching on the door. I think they tried and I give them an A for effort but as far as scary, the only thing scary is I paid to rent it."
4,A good story of a skeptical parapsychologist's investigation,"Aidan Quinn actually spent some time at the American Society for Psychical Research before this movie was filmed, and the result is an unsually accurate rendering of what was involved in investigating hauntings and seances in the early 1900s. While the story has some implausible elements, it was nonetheless enjoyable and I particularly liked one of the plot twists towards the end. END"
3,You get a wonderful glimpse at a young Ms. Kate Beckinsale!!,"This movie is set in the early 1900s making it feel old from the very beginning. It has a slow start, but it quickly picks up. One must keep up with certain happenings of the movie, because the movie will all come together at the end. Kate Beckinsale is nude throughout the movie, but nothing too graphic or vulgar in anyway. I think an underlying theme to this movie is water and fire. If you notice, there is a great deal of water and fire going on. People in water and houses on fire. One last thing to note, this movie is not for everybody. Some people may be quite disturbed or offended by the outcome of the movie. Enjoy it!"
3,Great Ghost Story....Poor DVD,"If you appreciate a good ghost story, this fits the bill. It's done in the way only the British can present a ghost story. The thrill is in the tale, not the special effects. A bonus is Kate Beckinsale, who is absolutely irresistable, and a great cameo by Sir John Gielgud.The sad thing is that this DVD is in Fullscreen format only, so you lose the widescreen feel. Also, audio is only in Dolby 2.0. Perhaps this will be rereleased in letterbox and Dolby 5.1 or DTS. Still...a great story though. 3 stars for the film, 0 stars for the DVD."
5,Beautiful and Mysterious Gothic-type Ghost Story,Haunted starring Aidan Quinn was an excellent movie. I loved the spooky house. The strange relationship between the siblings at the house was intriguingly decadent. I particularly enjoyed the performance of the housekeeper. The film is full of vivid imagery and keeps you guessing until the end.
3,Silly but sort of entertaining,"There are some very silly sequences here, but mainly this is not a horror story. It is a story of regret and guilt; a man accidentally caused his sister to die when they were kids, and now she haunts him. There are secrets in the old house as well which I will not reveal, concerning some people who live, or used to live, there."
1,Movie is great but the DVD is a big disappointment,"This review is more about the actual DVD instead of the movie. I bought this DVD to replace my VHS but have some misgivings after doing so. After comparing the transfers side by side there is very little difference in picture quality. Detail isn't much better either except you can see more film grain on the DVD than on the VHS. Another minus is there is no closed captioning or subtitles on the DVD, but the VHS does have closed captioning. So if you are hard of hearing the video tape is your best bet. There are not extras of anykind on this DVD just the movie and it's pan and scan, not widescreen. Maybe 1:33:1 is the OAR for this movie but I doubt it. Oh well, I guess what I'm saying is if you have the VHS go ahead and stick with it unless you must absolutely have every movie you own on DVD."
3,Enjoyable,"It's worth the watch to see Kate Beckinsale and John Gielgud on the same screen. The movie lacks any suspense or an element of fright, although the twist at the end was almost a surprise. The R rating is due to nudity and not gore or violence. There's no need to buy it unless you're a fan of any of the stars. Rent it first and judge for yourself."
3,Eccentric ghosts run around naked...,"I thought this film was pretty good and had some good acting, it was mysterious and a little spooky. However, I felt it was too boring in places and sometimes the F/X were not as convincing as they should have been. It's a shame this film is underated, it could have been a lot better and I'm sure that the novel would be scarier."
2,The Haunted,"The Haunted was visually appealing to say the least, unfortunately that was all I found to be appealing about this movie. I just thought the movie was very slow and predictable, the ""twist ending"" could be seen practically from the opening credits. But maybe I've just watched too much horror to be surprised anymore. The ghost story takes a backseat to the love story, so if that's your thing, you may really enjoy this, but from a horror fan's perspective, I found the whole thing to be very blah."
3,Mediocre horror/mystery featuring Kate Beckinsale,"Some genuinely scary moments here, but the film is so saturated with the most hackneyed horror staples that the good scenes are undermined. Horror has long made money off exploiting young women, but it's particularly painful to see the talented Kate Beckinsale (The Last Days of Disco, Brokedown Palace, Pearl Harbor) labor under Lewis Gilbert's exploitative direction. Sir John Gielgud seems tranquilized in a Mephistophelian bit part, and Aidan Quinn looks sorry he picked up the phone the day Gilbert called. The early glimmers of Brideshead Revisited are quickly bludgeoned away by crude and continual sexual references and gratuitous flashes of nudity, and a facile linking of sex with death in the tradition of Slumber Party Massacre Part 6. As intellectually light and unambiguous as a Scooby Doo episode."
2,A Rough Ride,"The first entry in Monogram's ""Rough Riders"" series is a dull programmer with little action until the exciting final reel. It's good to see Buck Jones, Tim McCoy and Raymond Hatton join forces, but they appeared in better Westerns than ""Arizona Bound"" (1941). Routine direction from serial specialist Spencer Bennet."
5,Thank you for your time,Great Movie. I got this movie for my dad and he is enjoying these great movies. Thank you.
3,Cute!,"I first picked up How to be Popular because of the title. It was so cool and it grabbed my attention. Despite the contradictory title, How to be Popular is a novel, and fantastic one at that! I remember hiding the cover because I didn't want people to see the title and think I was checking out a self help book. ;)The plot is very typical and predictable- geek transformation to popular. I guess there was a lesson to be learned from the story (be happy with who you are?) but it didn't play out as much as it should have. The writing was light and fluffy, and the book was very simple. My favorite part was Jake's nose. Without it, the book would have been terrible. Just saying. Read it :) It's nice on a rainy day when your bored as hell and have nothing to do."
4,Hats up for Meg!,"I have read this book four times, yet I still crack up at every joke! Written with a sense of humour and honesty, this is one of Cabot's greatest works.Yet, a little something is missing, somethimg less obvious than what we think- know- is going to happen...How could you simply not fall in love with this aspiring piece of chick lit? The plot is great and the story builded strongly, with the right details at the right moment. They should make a movie, although it would probably not be loyal to the movie, as usual. Soethhiing to read on vacation, along with the Pretty Liars series, something as amazing as this piece. If it s the first piece of chick lit you read you will simply adore it!"
5,huge Meg Cabot fan,"I love all of Meg Cabot's books - her young adult fiction, her adult fiction, her chick lit, her mysteries, all of it. This is one of my favorites and I've recommended it for all of my students, from 6th to 12th grade."
2,No role model Steph,"In full disclosure, I'm not exactly in the target audience for this book -- rather, I'm the parent of the target audience for this book. I thought the premise was sweet -- showing that genuine niceness and self confidence can lead to popularity. However, I found the references to ""Turkish-style"" sex scenes in romance novels unnecessary, the repeated scenes of Steph spying on her naked male neighbor distasteful, and the following quote to be a total dealbreaker: ""Because if I were dating Mike Finley, I would totally put out too."" Obviously teenage sex is a reality, but I have no interest in my 12 year old -- or 14 or 15 year old, for that matter -- reading a book where the heroine takes it for granted.This is a shame, because it is a sweet and funny book, well written with a great ending and a good message -- except for the sex."
2,Not worth it for me,"I guess this is going against popular (pun not intended) opinion, but I didn't really care for this book. I thought Steph was kind of lame and didn't really have any remarkable qualities. She doesn't seem to like the friends she has and she doesn't realize that she's in L-U-V with her nerdy guy friend. Some of the other characters were also frustrating. There was something about the timeline of the plot that made it really unbelievable - Steph starts getting really popular in the course of a week. I liked her relationship with her grandfather and his fiancee, who is actually her guy friend's grandma (weird). I hate stories where the main character swoons over the popular guy/girl, and then realizes at the last minute that it's their friend-of-the-opposite-sex that they really love."
5,How to be Popular-#1 fan,"I loved this book so much! It really showed the peer preasure that a lot of teens go through. I'm sure many people strive to be popular. But what the book is trying to say, is that if you can't be yourself, then it's not fun to be popular. It also showed how mean people can be, even if you just spill a drink on them. I was really excitied when Jason got together with Steph!I hope Meg Cabot makes a movie out of this story! How To Be Popular is the best book ever!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,lost and left forgotten,"""Kofi"" isn't a lost Donald Byrd classic--it's Byrd playing with the new Miles Davis sound, and it's not working for him. Columbia released Miles Davis's ""Bitches Brew"" in April 1970, so Davis didn't wake up in the middle of the night before the recording sessions and decide to go ""electric."" The first two tracks of ""Kofi"" are in Mono, indicating that they were intended as demos or run-throughs. The rest of ""Kofi"" doesn't get any better.""Kofi"" is currently available only as a CD-R, so if you want the original Blue Note edition, you'll pay collector's prices for it.The reason ""Kofi"" lay neglected in the vaults is because it isn't very good. There are a lot of great Blue Note releases by Donald Byrd (one of my favorite trumpeters) still in print that pre-date ""Kofi,"" and you'd be better off with any of them. If you're looking for Blackbyrds type funk, ""Kofi"" isn't that either. So regardless of which phase you like, ""Kofi"" is a loser."
1,FALLING from ORBIT,"FIRST GENERATION is a collection of early 4-track demos made while the band was still forming.If you want to hear bad, muffled, monophonic versions of ""Love-Missile F-11"" or ""Sex-Bomb-Boogie,""then this CD is for you. But why would you want to? The sound quality is horrible,and it's difficult to figure out how these ugly little songs ever led to a major recording contract.Also included are a handful of 8-track demos recorded in the early 90's.These songs might have been interesting if they weren't so boring.Unless you're a Die-Hard Sputnik Fan, intent on owning EVERYTHING ever recordedby Sigue Sigue Sputnik, this is a worthless CD.By the way, there are about 3 different versions of this CD,unofficially referred to as ""1st Generation"" ""2nd Generation"" and ""3rd Generation.""They are all essentally the same album with different cover art; each ""Generation""has 1 or 2 extra tracks than the version that preceded it.They're all equally boring, though..."
3,What the pack includes,"The accessory kit contains a fairly nice case (Minolta branded) and a set of cheap rechargeable batteries. Amazon doesn't tell you what it includes, which was a little frustrating for me, since the camera arrived a week ahead of the accessory pack, and I purchased other rechargeables in the meantime. The case is small, so no room for accessories, but has a belt loop, so works very well for one-day trips. The batteries are good as a backup, but a little weak as main batteries. A $49.99 value? No. But as a gift with purchase, it's not bad."
3,This takes the cake,"You know what would be, like, really helpful in deciding whether to get this kit to go with the camera I just ordered? It would be helpful if the listing said what came in the kit! Is that too much to ask?"
3,Bum bum bum...,"I agree with thingy from Bruxelles and think that this is a super track...so is FLASHBACK.Check out ""it's a soul thing"" BY Silicone Soul @ SOMA!!!!"
4,Readable Willard,"Frankly I like Dallas Willard's stuff but sometimes he is tough sledding. I've taken several runs at ""The Divine Conspiracy"" based on countless rave reviews but inevitably I give up. So ""The Great Omission"" may not be all fresh and profound like some would like, but it has one pretty good thing going for it -- it is readable.Give it a try."
5,An intriguing discussion emerges of definitions and understandings gone awry.,"Douglas Willard's THE GREAT OMISSION: RECLAIMING JESUS'S ESSENTIAL TEACHINGS ON DISCIPLESHIP draws a distinction between Jesus' last command to 'make disciples of all nations' and the difference between a 'disciple' and a 'Christian'. It's this misunderstanding, according to Christian thinker Willard, which has been the church's 'great omission', and he seeks to clarify and rectify this misunderstanding through analysis of New Testament lifestyles and teachings, and ideas on how Christians can remain faithful without applying their understanding of the Kingdom of God to all life. An intriguing discussion emerges of definitions and understandings gone awry.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
2,Hard to Read; To Much Philosophical Jargon,"We were reading this in a Bible Study I was in. Maybe it's just me, but it was terribly painful to get from one page through the next. It is way too deep and for the average reader, very hard to interpret Dallas' writing style. The sentences are full of unnecessarily ""big"" words, and his prose is just....well, ""boring"". I actually couldn't get through it all and stopped going to the class. That's how it became for me. I won't purchase or study his writings anymore; I just can't get through the complicated sentence structures and verbiage. Sorry."
2,Part Two,Great follow up to Divine Conspiracy... a reminder to keep moving toward Jesus in the process of transformation and Kingdom living.
4,Introduction to the disciplines - nothing new here,"Dallas Willard is a joy to be able to bump brains with in book format. No other book has had the effect on me that Divine Conspiracy did, and still does. However, if you have read Willard's other works, you will find little new here. The Great Omission is a collection of essays, which overlap each other quite often, and can get very repetitive. This one is for completists only. Good for maybe picking up and reading a different essay every so often, but reading from front to back can get exhausting. Still, it's Willard, so it gets 4 stars. If you've never read any Willard, this is not a bad place to start. Maybe his most accessable work to date."
1,Johnny Crow's Garden,"I was outraged by what Amazon sent me. I had ordered a ""new"" copy of this book, thinking that perhaps Amazon was able to get copies even though the book is out of print. What I received appeared to be a xerox of the original book. The pictures weren't even in color. I should have ordered a ""used"" copy and perhaps would have received an original. I think I should get my 12.00 back."
5,get them into books!,"Johnny Crow's Garden was a perfect book for visually and verbally alert kids when I was tiny (about 1964). It's still vigorous; I relocated it and have it on our bookshelf today. Leslie Brooke is a great illustrator and his simple story speaks, over nearly 100 years, with universal chuckles and themes to keep us amused while turning the pages. Read it to your children as my mother read it to us, and the words will stay all your children's lives, prompting them to seek out more books."
4,i like it alot,First let me just say that i first purchased a Philips Exp212 mp3 cd player and it sucked. It played mp3 tracks but took too long to load each track and made way too much noise during mp3 playback. Then fortunately i found this product. It plays only mp3's but has every feature that an ordinary mp3 player has except the id tags. It doesn't make any noise during mp3 playback and is small enough that i can take it anywhere without hassle. Not to mention it is extremely light which is a definite benefit. For about 60 bucks this is has the best mp3 player out there as far as the price goes.
2,Nice but.....,"too bad it doesn't last. I bought this CD player because i trusted Panasonic, and liked the price tag. The headphones ok, but they always fell off my head. The radio reception is pretty nice and it doesn't skip when playing CDs. The only problem I had with it was the fact that the names didn't show when i played MP3s. However, the durability is by far the worst I've ever seen. Within a month the part that held the cd player closed had broken off, and the motor that turns the CD was broken. My friend had the same one, and the laser broke as well. I would recommend this only to people who have only a month before they go deaf and want a cheap short-term CD player"
1,"""Resume"" feature doesn't work as advertised","The one feature that I really need in a portable CD player is that it resumes exactly where play left off when I pressed stop. The Panasonic SL-SV550 CD/MP3 player claims to do exactly that, but what it really does is start at the beginning of whichever track play was stopped at. So if you're 15 minutes into a 20 minute long song, press stop then press play a few seconds/minutes later, it starts over at the beginning of that 20 minute long song. I don't know what most people's definition of ""resumes exactly where it stopped"" is, but that certainly isn't mine.Doesn't anyone make a portable CD player with a real resume feature any more?"
2,Cheaply built,"I had very little use, less than 2 hours before the latch broke off while keeping it in a bag. While it was in use, it seemed fairly good, but the volume is too lowI'm questioning Panasonic as a company in general after this and getting a VCR that likes to spit out tapes"
2,Not Satisfied,"For the specs of the Panasonic SL-SV550 CD Player souned pretty good, well CD player, plays MP3 formated CD's & AM/FM radio, however it hasnt lived up to what I expected. First time I ever droped the CD player it snaped open breaking the front latch & the back sensor, taped the back sensor down so now it plays CD's but the lid doesnt close so I keep it in a case or put something ontop of it while playing. The sound quality on the headphones isn't good at all, sound doesnt go loud & you can hear everything going on around you. Also some people said the radio reception was great, well it isnt great but it isnt terrible, but I'm leading more towards the bad reception side. One good thing about this CD player is all the features (CD, MP3, AM/FM Radio) and the somewhat long battery life. Also this CD player is very light. In the end, I wouldn't reccomend buying this CD player to anybody else, find something else."
1,Volume is WAY too low!,"I can't recommend this player. It has one big flaw that I couldn't past. (I returned it the day after I bought it) The maximum volume is extremely low! Unless you are going to listen to CDs in a quiet area or need to hear surrounding sounds (such as a baby crying), don't buy this player. Even with seperately purchased high quality headphones, you'll still hear almost everything going on around you."
4,Not loud enough,"Everything fine, except for me, critical problem - cannot get enough volume when playing a CD. Great volume for the radio."
4,Best price to performance ratio,"Hello,I purchased this product from Amazon (as always, the lowest priced!).Pros:- Very easy to use, easy navigation buttons- Nice bass boost system- Plays CBR as well as VBR MP3 files great! (Tested with Lame 3.93, alt-preset-standard). Yeah I had to test it myself, no one ever wrote abt it!- Plays CDR/CDRW - CDR/CDRW with CDFS tested, works very fine. CDRW with UDF not yet tested.- Excellent digital AM/FM tunerCons:- The headfone wire sometimes comes out (kinda loose)- I had to order new $5 Sony headfones, the Panasonic ones that coem along aren't that good - this is however a personal choiceThis may not be the best player in the market vis-a-vis sound quality, but is simply great for its $55 value. So if you're looking for a first time player with no frills - this is the perfect thing to go for.If you are an audiophile and want only the best, and want advanced features like ID3 tags etc, and dont mind a $100+ price tag, go for the IRiver series or SONY."
5,"Fine Panasonic unit, but not perfect.","The SL-SV550 has been replaced by the SL-SV570, now featuring Panasonic's 'D.Sound' for enriched clarity, as well as mp3 remastering.Pros: mp3 capability, excellent FM tuner, good S-XBS, 30 station presets. Great sound overall.Cons: doesn't read ID3 tags, subpar headphones, no line level out (like Sony).Some headphones that work very well with this unit are Koss's KSC55 or ""The Plug"", also by Koss."
1,Turn it up!!!,"I was very dissapointed when I tried to turn up the volume, it was not loud at all. Also the headphones were cheap and the buttons too small...I do have to admit that I don't have any problems with it skipping or functioning in general, but I am very unhappy with my purchase."
2,I can't hear a thing,"I was so dissapointed when I finally tried this much awaited delivery. Finally I had a mp3-cdr-cdrw-am-fm-player narrowed down from a very few choices I must say. The feel was of cheap plastic. It started to skip after 5 minutes of testing. And I couldn't hear a thing through the [bad]headphones. I plugged it in the car, cranked both car, and player volume to the max, and I could get sound equivalent to what would sound as setting 3 on the volume dial in my car compared to setting 25. I sent it back. And so the quest goes on. Any suggestions? I am looking for mp3-cd-cdr/rw- with at least fm tuner, for hard core gym, and running workouts, with tons of volume. Oh and I did not take this player to the gym."
3,It's ok,"It's not too bad, but it's not loud enough. When you're in the train in NY you want to drown people out. Me personally I want to feel like I'm right there listening to them play. Another thing, I had a cd player that when I pressed play after I stopped it, it would start exactly where it stopped...to the second, but this one starts at the beginning of the song which isn't too bad but i prefer to stop at the exact minute. If you don't care for it to be too loud, this isn't too bad. That was what really disappointed me about this product."
1,Breaks way too easily!,"I got one from Target, and it broke after a few weeks. My sister later got the same one, and hers did the same.The latch to open the cover broke both times, so the cover stayed open unless we held it down or used scotch tape. Mine made clacking noises when I tried to play CDs, because something was wrong with the moving laser. Hers doesnt even play CDs anymore.. only the radio works.To be honest, we dont take the best care of our electronics. But we've always been able to use our old portable cd players after accidentally dropping them on all sorts of surfaces. I think my Panasonic sl-sv550 broke after dropping it once from a height of 3 feet onto carpet. My sister said she dropped hers too. This player falls way below the minimum level of durability required by portable devices."
2,Not impressed - I got a dud.,"I have two fundamental problems with this unit. The first is I cannot play MP3's on the unit. It scans the folders and files correctly then when you think it's about to play it simply shuts off. I've burned a small stack of CD's - using various settings - thinking there was something I was missing - but no - as that small stack plays on my friends Sony MP3 car stereo.It does play my CD-DA music CD's, but the volume has a low range. I expected more - I got less. Not sure if this unit is defective, but since I bought in the US and live in Costa Rica I appear to be SOL."
3,Returning it,"I've puttered around for years with an old Panasonic that was made before the anti-skip technology was common. I bought this one for that reason but, when jogging, it will skip. The controls were not great, it could use a remote (any sports model shouldn't require you to press buttons on the player to change a song or station), and an AC adapter."
1,"It's a piece of trash, don't buy it","It's really crappy stuff. The sound is not good, the earphone is cheap, and it died around a couple of weeks.You will regret if you buy it."
1,i'm back... and i'm mad!,"when i first bought the CD i left a review saying that the latch which keeps it closed breaks off very easily...will guess what? a couple of month later, after i had gotten it fixed, the latch broke off AGAIN.and then today... my CD player just stopped functioning. the buttons don't really do anything... and the the CD doesn't spin.SAVE YOUR MONEY... DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF TRASH!"
2,good but...,"I bought this based on the reviews stating that for a low end CD/MP3/Radio, it was acceptable but not great, and a good value for the price. However, it has a completely unacceptable issue with playing MP3's: it has a low frequency buzz from the sampling. I returned the first unit, and the 2nd had the same problem. The same MP3 disc on 2 other portable players and 2 computers didn't have this problem. Plus as mentioned before, it's a pain to rename the MP3 tracks for the player to recognize them correctly."
4,Lots of features for a surprisingly low price,"This thing has MP3 playback WMA playback, an AM/FM radio, with 30 preset stations, and it plays CD-R's, RW's, and normal CD's. There is'nt really anything on this CD player that cant be put on it. It is shocking that Panasonic managed to put this one out for such a low price.Pros:-Low price for many features-Can play all kinds of CDs-Nice volume control-Bass boost-Track repeat, album repeat, etc.Cons:-VERY confusing controls-Comes with cheap headphones-Bass boost is'nt enough-Can never really get it to be very loud, especially in a planeOverall, this is a great product for the price, but it really has some improvements that can be made. I like it, I recommend it, but if you are looking for better overall design, check out some iRiver CD players. If you're on a budget, however, it doesn't come any better than this one."
3,Very fragile,"This player is as fragile as an egg!!! I take it to the gym and there is always something happening to it. It came with a great holder. But if you touch the holder the unit comes on. So I am constantly changing batteries. Also the open and hold switches are made of cheap materials that break at the drop of a hat. In fact, I'm in need of a repair now!!!! Also, whose bright idea was it to have the battery compartment inside the unit. What a pain. If I could get my money back I would."
4,Don't Give Up On This Gem,"I have had this CD player for about a year, and have thoroughly enjoyed using it. I use it every day while commuting between home and work. I have never had any problems with CD skipping, radio reception, or battery life. In fact, I have only changed the batteries three times in the year that I have had it--and I use it five days a week!I, too, had the cd-tray latch pop off, but it only happened when I recently dropped the player on the ground. A quick call to Panasonic Parts got me a replacement latch--and it only cost me $5 (including shipping). The $5 I paid for the replacement part is a steal compared to what I would have paid for a new player of the same caliber."
3,Great for 2 Weeks.,"I've had this product for about two weeks. I used it alot but while it my backpack, the cheap little latch snapped off and now I can't use the cd player anymore. Radio still works, but unless I want tape around my player its annoying to have the lid keep flopping up."
4,Excellent for it's price!!!,"This unit is loaded with cool features at a surprizingly low price. It is very well built - strong enclosure (I tested it:). Anti-Skip feature is excellent, and so is the sound quality. The tuner works well half the time for me, but I find it very picky sometimes. It all depends on your location. I believe the headphones cable serves as an antenna. Works well outside. MP3 discs have to be prepared according to instructions, but it is pretty simple and it works great. Battery life is impressive!PROS:- Compact, Light, Strong- Excellent Battery Life- Battery Level Indicator- Great Sound Quality- Loads of features- Unbeatable PriceCONS:- Buttons are poorly positioned - require looking at them to operate.- No light on display- No built in battery charger- ID3 Tags Not SupportedOVERALL I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!"
4,Great player for the price,"I recently bought a different package of this same CD player which I would recommened over this. It includes better headphones as well as a remote, making this intuitive player even more convenient to use.As for the CD player itself, I found that it pretty much only skips if the user intentionally tries to, and even at that, its pretty hard to make it skip. Since it uses the headphone cord as the radio antenna, with a little fiddling I was able to get good reception almost anywhere. The sound quality is good and the player seems to have better amplification compared to other players in this price range.One annoyance is the need to number tracks/albums on the MP3 CD if you want to have any chance of finding the songs you want. Either is not required, however. Also, the lack of a tag readout can create a guessing game of which song you're listening to, though for the price I can't expect a much better screen.Overall, a good, easy to use, and affordable product."
1,"don't buy it, it's a waste of money","when i first bought this cd player, it was a good deal and it seemed to be very well made. but after a few months it started to break down. the cd payer first started to rattle, and then it finally broke. also, the latch broke off quite easily. as for the mp3 player, it is almost impossile to play them. it is to much of a hassle to load them on to the player and 99% of the time it dosn't work. also, it has a horrible volume range and the battery life was also very poor. the only good thing about this cd player was the radio, which was fairly decent and much louder then the cd player."
5,My favorite white tennies.,"Just as flawless as the skateboarder behind these shoes, the white Appleyard Rewire's take the prize for best looking white tennies. You don't know a good looking shoe till you see it and these just got it. Keep 'em clean boys. The Lugz Birdman's and Adidas Superstar series are great white shoes also. Gangsta."
3,"Too short of an expiration date or ""use by "" date","The product in question should have a much longer ""use by date"". Both of the benebac products that I got were this way with expiring dates of less than 5 months. Also, the syringe styled benebac should have an extra dial on the stem. You dial back the dial and that way you can not over dose the animal. The dial prevents you from pushing the syringe past the dial-cutoff. As it stands, you have to be very careful not to push the syringe too hard or too quickly. That is kind of hard when your trying to hold a parrot inone hand and the syringe in the other. Do you know how easily a parrot can bite you this way?"
2,Quickhand,"I did not find this book or technique well thought out. Within the first chapter, I put this technique down in favor of a different, more intuitive technique. There were a couple of points that made sense but overall, not the technique for me."
5,a must read book,"This book should be read just before, or just after Stuart's beloved ""The Thread That Runs So True"". In it, you discover parts of his life that are only hinted at in ""Thread"". Like the year he spent in the rough and tumble world of the steel mill, and the time he traveled with a carnival. There are wonderful sections about how he worked his way through Lincoln Memorial, and his time at Vanderbilt, where he wrote the paper that was the original version of this book."
4,Worth the investment,"I use the Nikon D300, and I had been using the AA battery packs. I spent quite a bit of time fussing over the added expense of the EN-EL4 and then about died at the price for this charger. Looking back I really wish I'd purchased them earlier. The charger quickly tops off the battery before a shoot, and fully charges a depleted battery in only a few hours.There are lights on the charger to let you know the status of the battery. I've plugged a fully depleted battery into this and had a very usable charge in just over 30 minutes charging. NOT fully charged, but better than an 8 pack of AAs!I'm now buying an extra EN-EL4 and using my AA holders to store charged batteries for the flash.I gave this 4 stars because the price seems excessive."
3,It's a charger for crying out loud!,Nothing much left to say except that Nikon is really proud of it and wants your wallet. Bottom line is that if you need the EN-EL4 battery you have to buy a charger for it.
4,The price isn't part of the 5 star rating,"This charger is great for my d300 el-en4a but, I don't understand why its so expensive. Granted, it charges a bigger battery and regardless of what I think, the price is set and unless you could find a used or cheaper charger, for me, charging the darn battery is a great thing. Can't say much about it other wise, other than it has somewhat of a indicator of how much of the battery is being charged, that's about it."
5,INIS perfumes are amazing,"I just received this fragrance and like INIS and INIS O'R...it is amazing. I usually cannot wear perfume or be around anyone wearing perfume because it causes migraines. But I have to say, these perfumes smell wonderful and do not cause me any migraines. I get so many compliments when I wear these perfumes. And I think Arose will be my favorite of all of them. It reminds me of my mom, who has passed...and that comforts me."
4,Nice...but not that unique.,I ran out of the normal Inis and thought I'd try another version. The Inis Arose is a lovely scent. It's light and has a very true rose smell. It can easily be worn most of the year (maybe not winter). But the only thing I didn't like about Arose was that my other Inis was such a unique scent. I loved that about it. The Inis Rose isn't all that unique. I feel like it's really similar to a Victoria Secret perfume I used to have.
4,very calm but nice,"I wanted more intensity in the drumming and never got it, but it is still an instant classic! its a good mellow album nice fore background music and relaxing."
5,Love my new ankle bracelet!,"I had one just like it before and the darn thing broke! this one is so much better and shiny. I like mine to be a tight fit so my is 9"". I love it."
5,"nice, very nice","i am stunned at how nice this bracelet is, it was a bargin at this price, diamond cut and sparkles, shines, very nice, if you are looking for a bracelet with some width to it, this is not it, however it seems to be a very sturdy, well made item good for if you just want a bit of sparkly jewelry around your ankle.i am happy with it, enough to check out other items this vendor is selling........"
5,Amazing anklet,I recently purchased this anklet based on other reviews and the price. I was not disappointed. The anklet is very well made. The design is unusual and very pretty. I liked it so much I am now ordering the necklace and bracelet to match.
5,Beautiful,Arrived quickly. Beautiful and delicate. Fits nicely. Will look nice with sandals. I am very pleased with this product and will probably order more for gifts.
1,Don't buy if you can afford quality,"I guess I should've known better for the price, $6 i think for a sterling silver ankle bracelet... not good. I shouldve waited and spent the extra money for something good. The seller was great and everything came fast and whatnot but i KID YOU NOT, this bracelet turning my skin BLACK! The bracelet so far maintained its color and still looks pretty but it turned my foot BLACK. My cousin told me to throw it away before my foot falls off! No bueno."
5,Beautiful Anklet,"This is a very pretty anklet. I purchased the 9 inch and it is a little snug but I think that is par for the size. the next size up seemed like it would be too big for me. The chain is silver, it's a little thinner then I thought it would be but not drastically thin, just dainty and feminine. It arrived somewhat fast and well packaged. I would recommend this item and seller."
4,Wow Cute,I really like this anklet. It's very cute and it sparkles just like everyone said. It's thin but it seems to be holding on just fine. I worth wile purchase for the price.
4,Im pleased,"Im gay and bought this anklet for the summer. Its a bit thin than i wanted it to be but im getting used to it. Ive had it one for a week, sleeping and bathing in it, its strong and shiny. Id recommend if you like thin anklets. The handle was a bit hard to put on though."
4,Good service,"I received this anke braclet but it was broken, they sent me a pickup tag and sent me a new one, its beautiful!thanks for the good service, will do business with them again!"
3,Ankle Bracelet,"Very pretty braclet. Simple, yet classy. Light weight. I would have liked it to be a bit thicker, but I am still very satisfied with the quality of the bracelet."
3,Nothing special,"This video is alright for kids, but never held my granddaughter's interest. Certainly not as good as Peter Cottontail."
1,How can this be a DELUXE edition with no extras?,"This is definitely one of the lesser known RANKIN/BASS specials and should have been combined on THE EASTER BUNNY IS COMIN' TO TOWN DVD when it first came out AS AN EXTRA. If this was going to be released on it's own (since it is only 25 minutes) WB should have included a nice documentary with ARTHUR RANKIN, PAUL COKER, etc. I do like the cover and the fact they included the RANKIN/BASS logo on the cover BUT who is minding the store at WB HOME VIDEO these days?"
4,The kids do love it!,"It's supposed to be a short version of Monopoly (30 minutes, at most). I love that it's short- it is a fun game, where you can explode properties or take over others. I got this for $5 and I'll tell you the quality of this game for that price is very high end- it'll definitely outlasts the kids. I think the kids love the ""Gold Rush"" concept behind the game."
2,incomplete order,"i ordered this item from silver spoon store through amazon web site. i received the item in good condition; however it did not have the presentation box. i contacted amazon who contacted the silver spoon store who answered and said that since it was a discontinued item there was no box available. i had informed them that if no box was available, i did not want the item. they promised to send me a return label which they did. i have sent it back to them by ups. i was disappointed, not so much by amazon or the silver spoon store; just disappointed that i could not get that which i expected. i will continue to use amazon for much of my on line shopping."
5,"Waterford Crystal 2nd Edition 12 Days of Christmas Champagne Flute, Two Turtle Doves","What an exquisite piece of crystal! This completes my 12 days of Christmas Champagne Flutes by Waterford. Beautiful design great craftsmanship. Waterford is now made in different parts of the world, not longer just in Ireland. It would be good to know before ordering where each item is manufactured."
1,Giftshop1234 8th Maids-s-Milking Waterford Champagne Flute,I ordered this for a Christmas gift. The wrong items was sent to the receiver and I contacted the company after the holidays. Well the long and the short of it is that it still has not been received. I recently sent them an e-mail which has gone unanswered. No one is there on Fridays. I called during the week and got a message that they close at 3:30PM etc. Today their machine said that they are there from 10-6 on Monday thru Thur. I'll see what Monday brings. I am very disappointed with this whole deal.
3,A Way to get you to buy 12 glasses when you only wanted 2.,"Kind of a sales tactic. You get one or two, and then decide to be collectible, you should buy the whole set as they come out. So now I have 4, and don't know what to do with them. The boxes they're in are large, so not easy to store either.And the engraving is really just a cheaply done etched picture, with little artistic merit.But if you like Waterford, have money to burn, and have plenty of room to store a 5x5x10"" box for each one, what the hay? Go crazy...The whole set will probably set you back about $450-500 on sale."
4,Romantic Gift for multiple years,"This is not a set I would collect for myself. It's ideal for gift giving, particularly to a lifelong friend you miss very much.It's a romantic them and it will carry you through 12 holidays!(BTW - the handsome ""limited edition"" box is actually 13""x 6"" x 6"" and it stores or ships quite nicely. It's a lovely red box with a silver suitcase latch, that could can ad a few more personal items to, before giving.)"
1,Be careful,"This fan won Maximum PC's Kick A$$ Award which is why I purchased it. Instructions to install are poor at best. Although Cooler Master makes installation look easy you must pull out the entire motherboard to secure a backplate on the underside of the motherboard. I have a BRAND NEW motherboard that was even used in the instructions page in the illustrations and the backplate would NOT fit! I had to use nuts that were supplied for a different processor and worked fine. However, it only cooled CPU by 1-2 degress at best. As a result I returned it for a refund and bought a front case ventilation fan for $20 that improved airflow and reduced temp by 8 degrees."
3,They are OK ... certainly not great,"The mugs are nice but not really as cheerful as I had expected. The colors are a bit on the dull side, they are not very vibrant.Also the description of these mugs suggests they are from Germany but mine are actually from Indonesia and even that I cannot be very sure, because there was just a sticker with Indonesia written on it, stuck at the bottom of each mug.For the price I did expect much better quality so am kind of disappointed and not really sure if I could recommend them for the price."
2,lisa from sgs,"i thought that the book was a fair read. it wouldn't be worthwhile to me to read it again and it hasn't been added to the list of books i would recommend, but to the author's credit, it was well written. i feel the ending left something to be desired, and it could have used more of what was going on in the character's surroundings; it became monotonous after awhile."
3,Under the Persimmon Tree,I felt that the story was overall really well done and the ideas were great. However I really wish that the author could have gone into more detail about what happened to the characters in the end. I also wish that the reader could hear more about what was happening to Nur andBaba-jan. I felt like someparts were to long and some too short and I didn't feel very connected to the character. I think that the story has a lot of power but the way the story is described does not.
2,Salome from SGS,"The book had an excellent story line, one with plenty of potential. the only problem was that the author did not take this potential into thought. the plot line went all over the place, and there was very little character development. very few things were explained to there full extent, and the ending was short and unexplanatory, with the idea that the author had either been rushed to finish the story or simply lost interest in the whole thing. the suprising thing was that many of the authors other work is exceptional. i hope that there will be many more books from this author, and hope that the books that are to follow will be better then ""under the persimmon tree""."
3,Natalie from SGS,"I suppose it was alright, but it was a little bit dull at times, with some stereotypes about women that I don't really agree with. I think it gave me as a reader a good sense of what it was like to live in Pakistan during that time. I'm not sure I would really reccomend this book, as I am not a big fan of the two-perspective stle. The perspectives skip around a lot, and it's very hard to keep track of what's going on where. All in all, it wasn't a bad bok, but it could have been better."
3,Linnea from SGS,I felt that the story was overall really well done and the ideas were great.

1,feature keyboard that doesn't work,"I bought this keyboard a couple of weeks ago, and I did not like it from the beginning, but decided to give some time to accommodate to unfamiliar layout. Now I fed up with it.I type this review on it, so I get the reinforcement to my one star rating every space between the words - namely the curved space bar is almost not moving down when you press it not in the center...I hoped that Microsoft knows to manufacture at least hardware.Unfortunately their hardware quality is consistent with their software."
3,not wireless,This item was advertized on Amazon as a wireless keyboard. It was returned unused when it was discovered that the item was a wired product.
2,Very good.. Until i spilled a little water,This keyboard is what i was looking for.. I have big hands and the ergonomic is the only way to go. I had this keyboard for two weeks and i spilled a little bit of water on it. Half the keys on the left side stopped working.. I quickly unplugged it and my friends said let it dry out. I let it dry out for three days and the keys are still broken.. Its now three months later with a non working keyboard.. Very bummed that a little bit of water would destroy this keyboard.Ive had many Logitech keyboards wireless and wired. Even spilled water on those and they still work like a charm.I tried to see if i can get a warranty or trade in from there website have not even heard back from them i sent over 5 emails.
2,MS 4000 Keyboard ~ Minority Report,"This is the minority report on this keyboard's ""ergonomics"" for anyone about to waste cash on this poser. Firstly, if you are one who inhabits a cleanly lit office space with about 1 candlepower of light per square inch this jet-black stealthy keyboard could be quite suitable there. If not so fortunate, a crippling flaw of this keyboard will present itself rather immediately... the constant fishing around for the proper keystrokes led only by your sense of touch. Sure I upgraded from a noisy, clicky, dirty white, AT connector keyboard that I ran into the ground after years of abuse. It was spacious, not compact like this one (heaven help you on a smaller keyboard than the 4000). I could get up at 0300 and bang out a letter with ease, bathed in only the dim light of the monitor. Why... BECAUSE MY OLD KB HAD EFFECTIVE KEY BUMPS YOU CHEAP MS MORONS.Maybe you're more tactile-sensitive? Prepare yourself for the non-existent keybumps. Buyer Beware!!!"
2,"Excellent shape, lousy key response","I love the shape of this keyboard. The curved, split design feels wonderfully natural under my fingertips, and the wrist wrest provides excellent support. Unfortunately, the key response is terrible. Keys are spongy and require a good bit of force to press. The worst offender is the space bar, which, as other reviewers have noted, is wobbly and unresponsive if pressed anywhere other than in the middle (and, given the split design, the middle is a difficult and impractical spot to hit). The space bar also rattles quite loudly, which may not be appreciated in a quiet office setting.I really wanted to stick with this keyboard for its excellent ergonomics, but the key response was a deal breaker. It's back to the trusty old Comfort Curve Keyboard for me. Now if Microsoft could figure out how to combine the light, pleasing keys from that with this one's ergonomic shape, they'd have a real winner."
2,"Awesome Idea, lousy keyboard","Loud keys are a serious issue, but I sent this back and exchanged it because of issues with the spacebar. I found if you hit the spacebar off center it would stick. This was the case with either my left or right thumb. This happened often enough to seriously slow down my typing."
2,The keyboard is too hard,"I got a standard Leveno keyboard and I thought this one will be better in term of ergonomic. But it's not in 1 way - required a hard key-press. The first thing I tried it, I immediately realized that I need a very hard press on keys. I thought because it's new. However, after using it for 3 months, the tips of my fingers get hurt because I need to push too hard."
1,Poor construction,"I purchased the keyboard just THREE MONTHS ago and the space bar is starting to malfunction. It either sticks and won't create a space or, as in the sentence above, sticks and creates too many spaces. This is with only average use. I have two other computers, an office desktop at work and a Toshiba NB205. The keyboard on the Toshiba, comparatively, is excellent and has lasted well through two years of constant, vibrant use. Other keys on the Microsoft ""product"" also gummy now. Poorly ""Mad e in China,"" under the Microsoft label/gi mmick."
2,Very Disapointed,"Fine keyboard, exactly what I expected. I was replacing a similar keyboard where the letters had worn off the keys. Guess what? Withing six months an even worse problem (letters wearing off on the keys)with this keyboard! NOT recommended!!"
3,some issues,"Recently switched to this model from the natural keyboard elite.cons:- The keys are quieter on this model, but slightly harder to depress causing a minor slow down. This is only a concern for the fast typers, and it could just be the unit I received.- The shortcut buttons look and feel kind of cheap.pros:- It looks pretty cool with black monitors and mice.- The wrist-rest is made out of a comfortable synthetic material."
2,"excellent at first, then....","i got this keyboard after a bad bout of tendonitis. shortly thereafter, my pain moved from inside my wrists (due to tiny keyboard) the the outside--due to the sloped hump in the center, which makes me hold my wrists sideways. the search continues. just be really aware of how you use it, and try it out in the store first if you can."
2,Loved it Until it Broke,"Great keyboard. Loved it! But it broke after only 3 months. Several keys suddenly stopped working. Tested it on multiple computers so definitely the keyboards problem. Going to try an Inland which looks the same, is half the price and has gotten good reviews."
2,Ouch!,"I wanted this keyboard because I have tendonitis in both hands and arms, and the layout felt very comfortable in the store where I tried it out. However, as some others have mentioned, the spacebar requires a lot of force if you have small hands and cannot press it down in the center. My thumbs and wrists hurt after just a few minutes (I could work for 15-20 minutes on my old keyboard before having that much pain). It's a shame because otherwise I really like the design; maybe they could split the space bar into two keys (one for each thumb) and then you wouldn't have to press it so hard."
1,"I ached before, now I hurt.","I spend anywhere from 3 to 7 hours typing nearly every day. I bought this keyboard thinking I would relieve some of the aching that recently developed in my wrists and arms. I tried for over a week to get used to this keyboard and finally decided to return to my old one after nearly ending up in tears from my discomfort and frustration. I was never able to adjust to the key placement and my typing speed was severely affected. I don't necessarily wish to discourage anyone from buying this keyboard, but instead ENCOURAGE trying it out in a store first. I believe I should have tried a less ergonomic keyboard first as I may have had an easier time adjusting. Pay close attention here: the spacebar is unbelievably stiff, just as another reviewer mentioned."
2,disappointed,"I used the original Microsoft Natural keyboard for so many years I can't remember, but I bought it the first year it was out. It was still working fine when I switched to a black Belkin copy. When I took that to work I bought the Microsoft Natural 4000 for home. It is fine except to one thing - after writing one book with it the E, D, S, and C keys are nearly blank. OK, that book was a year and half in the making and about 1 million characters but still my first one was put through much more than that with almost no letter wear. I don't understand why they would apparently cheap-out on the lettering."
3,"Love it, but letters soon rub off!!!!!","Am I the only person this happens to?A 95 words/minute typist and author (i.e., ""heavy user"") I'm on my 5th or 6th keyboard - two of them supplied free from Microsoft after the major-use letters rubbed off within a few months of use. (They cut me off after two, though.)All their ""Help"" people claimed they never heard of such a thing, but in my experience every keyboard has the same flaw. In the past, I even tried painting clear nail polish on the keys to protect them, but that didn't help much.I bought a 4000 in December,and now, less than eight months later, I can't see five letter keys or the period, and some of the other letters are shrinking as parts of them disappear. Although I'm a touch-typist, sometimes when I'm tired it helps to have visible characters. And it's really annoying.So I gave up just now and ordered yet another one. This is a maddening problem to have in an otherwise-perfect keyboard. Is it just planned obsolescence on Microsoft's part?"
1,I've gone through 3 of these keyboards because of tiny liquid spills,A tiny beverage spill should not destroy a keyboard and especially if it's left to dry for a while. These keyboards are destroyed the moment a few drops of liquid gets in-between the keys. I've gone through three of these and all liquid related. I tried to deal with it because I hate changing keyboard layouts and I use the same at work. I guess I'm going to replace my work keyboard at the same time and just be done with this company and their fragile products.
1,spacebar issue,love everything but the spacebar is kind of hard to press and takes decided effort .. kind of hard to press.. am i going to get arthritis or carpel tunnel from this?? i returned it once and this second one's the same.. not sure what to do..
3,NOT Wireless,"I bought this keyboard for my girlfriend. The main reason was that I thought it was wireless. (She hates all those cables.)In the product features section for this keyboard, it mentions a ""wireless design"".Hmmm.Otherwise, it's an ok keyboard."
2,Quality Issues,"I have an elbow problem that requires me to use an ergonomic keyboard. Microsoft is the only company that makes a proper ergonomic keyboard. I have used the older version at home for years. I purchased one for work about 9 months ago. It was wonderful. The keys were tight, with no play. I liked it so much that I requested one for Christmas. The one I received had a quality issue. The spacebar was very noisy - and drove me crazy. So, I returned it and ordered another. The second one was worse. Not only did the space bare ""clack"", but the ""N"" key did not work properly. We then went to Best Buy and purchased another. This one is a bit better, but the space key is still bothersome. The quality of this product has deteriorated over the space of 9 months, and I would not now recommend it. This is quite sad, because otherwise the product is excellent. I have notified Microsoft that they have a quality control issue."
2,"Nice design, bad execution","It's a comfortable keyboard to use, and the extras like the volume buttons and other shortcut keys are nice, but the workmanship and quality is just lousy. It often misses the 'i' key when I'm typing which is quite annoying. Yesterday my escape key stopped working all night until it magically started working again this morning.I have also had problems with a recent Microsoft mouse that I bought, which they replaced for free after 6 months when I called them and complained, but the replacement lasted only another 6 months.I love MS's ergonomic designs for their mice, keyboards, and gaming devices, but they really need to get some quality control if they want to keep their reputation in this market segment."
4,Great Ergo Design,"I love this keyboard because of the way, and the angle at which the keys are split. It is perfect for my tendonitis-prone left wrist, which is why I needed it. I only wish there was a bluetooth version because I use it with my laptop and I hate wires!"
2,Microsoft Natural Ergo Keyboard 4000,"I just can't get used to the Ergo type keyboard, used to a flat one, never seem to get my fingers on the right keys............I have three other Microsoft keyboards and all are flat and I like them, but this style isn't for me."
4,My second Ergo keyboard,"I and my wife are on computer for almost 8 hours every day. I have been using this keyboard for past 1 year due to wrist pain. My wrist pain was much less. When my wife started complaining of tingling sensation in fingers, I got her this and the 3M ergo mouse. It is 4 weeks now and the tingling is gone. The combination worked."
4,Keyboard is great except ...,"I just got the keyboard last night. It is great. The software installs very nicely. Only one big issue, which is why I am giving it a 4-star.The spacebar key is too difficult to be pressed from the edges (where I normally tend to press then).It seems I need to learn again to press the spacebar key in the middle. And if you think it is a minor issue, then no. The spacebar key push effort at the sides is 3-4 times more than any other sweet soft keys."
4,Good keyboard,I like this keyboard a lot it works well and even though I didn't think I would use the extra programmable keys I do sometimes. The problem is that I sometimes hit the Back and Forward keys when it would be better not to. Mostly it is my fault but I think the could have been placed better.The last Microsoft Natural keyboard I had had a screwed up arrows keypad and that is why I bought this one to replace it. I am used to the standard keyboard configuration. I like this keyboard because it is standard for the most part with a few extras. This time they didn't change the basic setup they just added to it.
2,Very disappointed,"After reading a ton of reviews on this keyboard, I decided to purchase one anyway. I got two whole weeks out of it before the ""y"" key stopped working altogether. Undaunted, I tried another, the second board was slightly better in that all the keys seemed to work... most of the time. The entire board is unresponsive and unreliable. For anyone who types quickly, this is not the keyboard for you. In addition, the lettering on the keys is rapidly disappearing. I love the setup and the feel of this board. Everything I look for except it's usability. If there are any missing ""n""'s in this review, you'll understand why."
2,Great keyboard / Terrible OS X drivers,"Using the most recent Intellitype 8.0 mouse and keyboard drivers on OS X Snow Leopard, my system would crash (Kernel Panic!) almost daily. It always happened when I would press a key (such as the arrow keys) in rapid succession. I could never reproduce the error at will, but when it did happen it was obviously frustrating since I'd lose everything I had running at that time. Deactivating the drivers would not help.After my system froze for the third time in a single day, I completely uninstalled all of the MS Intellitype software and haven't had a problem since. Only downside is I don't get to use the functionality of the extra keyboard/mouse buttons, but so far the trade off is worth it.I love the keyboard otherwise, I had the previous Natural keyboard for 15 years and hope to keep this one just as long."
2,Space bar problem still there,"Since there were so many complaints about the space bar on this, from so far back, I figured Microsoft would have fixed it. Nope. On the one I got, if you hit it just right, dead center on the LEFT side only, the sound was tolerable. Only one problem: I always use my right thumb for spacing. And when I did that, the ""clackety-clack"" was intolerable. The noise was exacerbated by the fact that the other keys are remarkably quiet, so the sound becomes even more annoying. It had to go back. I now have the Adesso Tru-Form Media, on which the keys are slightly louder but since the sound is uniform you don't notice it once you get into the rhythm."
3,Good keyboard but super noisey space bar,"Have used this keyboard for over a year without any major problems except for the noisey keyboard. I miss my old white MS Natural keyboard but I spilled water on it and it died. I do like the extra control at the top of the keyboard but I rarely use them. Microsoft, please fix the noisey SPACE BAR!!"
4,4000 Ergo,Got this keyboard a few weeks ago. It performs well. I had to use it for a while to get use to the design but even with the old hunt and peck method it serves me very well. I have easily grown accustomed to it. The only draw back is the on board sound control which seems very sluggish to show the volume adjustment bar. It seems to load that op very slowly. Even with the latest Windows 7 drivers. I had the same issue with other boards as well. Overall a very good buy and I am well pleased.
4,OK--but not great.,"I am a retired computer and typing teacher. I am probably much more fussy than an average user. I had one of the first curved keyboards made by Microsoft and I absolutely loved it.This keyboard makes a clicking noise every time I use the space bar. The space bar and several keys do not always push down enough when I push them. What I mean by that is that after I type a paragraph and I look at what I just typed, I now see missing letters or spaces that I know I typed in. I don't know if it is just this unit or if they are all like this.If it is just this unit, then I would rate the product higher. I will have to return this one and try another. A keyboard is a funny thing. If it doesn't have the right feel for you, you should get another."
4,Great Keyboard,"Great keyboard that works right out of box. Takes a little getting used to but once adjusted, this keyboard is terrific. Spacebar is not as soft as neighboring keys but still very usable, just a minor inconvenience. Other than that great keyboard overall."
1,Horrible space bar,"The space bar is loud, and you have to strike it hard pretty much dead center to make it work consistently. If you don'treally whackit,orifyou hit it closer to the sidethanto the center, you endupwith textthatlooks like this."
4,Its good,"The only thing that stinks is the attachment in the front. Its kinda cheap. Granted I gave it a good whack after this fugger killed me with a stupid marty and I lost the match, but c'mon! ;)Anyway. I love how it props up the front of the kb instead of the back. Don't have to have that weird angle w/ your hands."
4,Love it enough to overlook the bad,"I love this keyboard. I love the sound the keys make and the way the keys push and the ease of typing with them. I also like the ergonomic qualities. It has good quick keys also and a zoom feature I like. This is even the 2nd one I've purchased because I had to give 1 to my husband. I love everything about it EXCEPT and this is big for me..... I HATE the fact that after even moderate use, the letters on the keys fade off. Eventually, you have no lettering at all on the most used keys (t, e, s, etc.) It's ridiculous that the quality of the lettering is so poor on such an awesome keyboard. So if you are one of those hunt/peck typists or if you must look at your hands - you will be in trouble unless you learn where the keys you need live."
1,Microsoft should be ashamed.,"This keyboard is terrible, multiple key strokes are dropped causing the typist to have to constantly backtrack to correct misspellings. Keys on the incline are the worst in this respect, y, h, n, m, t, g, b constantly have to be repressed or pressed with a strength that will tire out the hand."
1,waste of money,"ridiculous: the space bar doesn't work properly. this, i realized too late, is a known design flaw that microsoft hasn't bothered to fix in years of selling this product. disgraceful"
5,Excellent keyboard,"I am very pleased with the ergonomics and functionality of this keyboard. It is comfortable, adjustable and feels solid to type on. The Microsoft drivers leave something to be desired but with a little work you can program all features to your liking."
4,MS Keyboard 4000,"This is a well-built, sturdy keyboard that looks like it should last a long time. The keyboard might be a tight fit into some shallow keyboard shelf-drawers. I recommend this keyboard."
3,Broken,"This is the second one I have bought the first one the ""uio"" buttons stopped working I didn't have the box to send it back so I ordered another one only to have it not work out of the box now I have to send it back. Hopefully third times the charm otherwise I'm going logitech next purchase."
2,too noisy to use around others,"the lay out is just fine, but it took a few weeks to learn to hit the keys hard enough to make them work, I now find myself pounding away at my keyboard, which is working ok for me. but- since I now work around others, I have annoyed everyone around me with how much noise I make, the space bar was the hardest to learn to hit, you have to really go at it to work it, its a very loud key. it will interrupt others phone calls in the area. it is so noisy, they are making me get a new one. the keys are also so hard to use, I do end up making countless mistakes even after using it for over 6 months now. its easy on your hands from a position point, but I wonder how much wear and tear I am getting from the way I have to pound these keys? it's just too much effort to keep using. I have also worn most of the letters off the keys."
1,"Dead keys in 5 months, buyer beware.","I've bought Microsoft ergonomic keyboards for years. My previous one lasted two years before keys mysteriously died -- not great longevity, but acceptable. But my newest one has become useless in just over 5 months. Today multiple keys on the right side just died on me, seemingly out of nowhere. Reading these other reviews, I guess they have a quality control problem with this board now; buyer beware."
2,Not recommend this keyboard,Not easy to hit space key. It's stiff in some angle in typing and loud. Not recommend this keyboard.
3,Space bar is touch,"I have been wanting an ergonomic keyboard for awhile and decided to take the plunge with this one, as it wasn't too expensive. I carefully read all the reviews and got it, hooked it up, and started using it. Yes, I understand there's a learning curve. But, as other reviewers have mentioned, that's not the issue here. I am a full-time author and type A LOT. This space bar is ridiculous - it takes an act of congress to move it. After a day of typing, I already am experiencing some pain from how hard I have to hit it with my thumb. I'm hoping it loosens up over time. Otherwise, I just wasted my money."
1,The space bar is ridiculous,"Due to a crack in my work laptop screen I asked my husband to run out and buy me a monitor and keyboard today. He came back with this keyboard and it looks great and I like the way it is shaped. However, the space bar is so poorly designed, it isn't really useable. Every time I hit the space bar it make a loud whacking sound. It is incredibly hard to push down, to the point I have been using this keyboard less than thirty minutes and I have pain in my right thumb and the area connecting to my pointer finger. Great job making an ergonomic keyboard that actually CAUSES pain. I had to take breaks to type this review. This is going back today. I searched the web and found complaints of this issue since 2008...how lazy is Microsoft that they haven't fixed it and keep selling it? I won't be buying a Microsoft replacement of any kind because of this. It is a shame because the keyboard is great otherwise, but this flaw renders it unuseable."
